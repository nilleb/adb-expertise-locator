Each  project  will  have \ndocuments. Tranche 1 was subject to standard environmental due \ndiligence  and  classified  as  category  B.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations  of \nin  Supplementary \ntranche  1  projects  are \nAppendixes H, I, J, and K. \n \nThe Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), launched \nby the Government in April 2008, is the country\u2019s strategic platform \nfor  development  during  2008\u20132020.  Its  aim  is  to  promote  growth, \ngenerate  wealth,  and  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability.  ANDS \ncovers  all  key  sectors  and  subsectors,  and  embraces  several \nthemes.  One  of  the  main  sectors  is  energy.  ANDS  establishes \nquantitative  and  qualitative  (physical  and  nonphysical)  targets,  and \ncovers generation, transmission, and distribution. Within the sector, \nANDS  covers  investments  in  new  and  existing  assets,  including \ntheir  management,  maintenance,  and  repair.  The  underlying \nobjective  is  to  provide  reliable  and  cost-effective  electricity  to \nindustry  and  people.  The  proposed  MFF  finances  a  medium-term \nslice  of  a  broader  Investment  Program.  It  is  also  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  country  articulated  in  the  Country  Strategy \nthe  Country \nand  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2006-2008,  and \nPartnership  Strategy  (CPS)  2009-2013  currently  under  preparation \nwhich  will  be  considered  early  in  2009.  The  CPS  calls  on  ADB  to \nprovide financing and advice for infrastructure (roads and railways), \npower and energy, and irrigation. The Government also wants ADB \nto  set  aside  money  every  year  for  private  sector  development  and \ntransactions.  The  ADB  strategy  responds  to  what  the  Government \nneeds, and focuses in areas where ADB has skills, knowledge and \ninformation,  as  well  as  a  reasonable  record  of  success.  The  CPS \nsupports  work  on  institutional  effectiveness,  particularly  those  in \ncharge of priority sectors. These interventions include (i) training for \nbetter planning and project management; (ii) gender mainstreaming; \n(iii)  financial  management,  anticorruption  policy  measures,  and \nfiduciary  oversight;  (iv)  private  sector  development;  (v)  safeguard \nmanagement; and (vi) regional cooperation. The CPS also calls on \n\n\fii \n\n \n\ntechnical,  operational,  commercial, \n\nADB to approach financing more programmatically, and proposes in \nparticular the use of the MFF. \n \nThe  development  of  the  Investment  Program  is  based  on \nlegal, \nassessments  of \nfinancial,  and  other  matters.  These  led  to  the  creation  of  a \nproblem  tree  analysis  (Appendix  2),  which  in  turn  led  to  the \nprojected  outcome  shown \nthe  design  and  monitoring \nin \nframeworks  (DMF)  for  the  Investment  Program  as  a  whole  and \ntranche 1. The DMFs are in Appendix 1. \n \nThe proposed MFF has two important features. First, it finances new \nthe  Afghanistan \nthe  Government  will  use \nassets.  Second, \nReconstruction Trust Fund to cofinance community services in areas \nwhere  power  and  energy  facilities  are  planned  and  are  being  built. \nThis  benefits  Government,  people,  contractors,  and  consultants.  It \nwill also enhance awareness of the villagers on the localized benefits \nof the Program, thereby lowering security risks.  \n \nThe MFF is proposed as the modality to extend ADB financing to \nthe  Investment  Program.  The  following  seven  points  clearly \ndemonstrates the justification of using the MFF modality:  \n \n(i) \n\nthe  amount  and \n\nIt provides flexibility to the authorities and ADB. Within the \nproposed maximum financing of $570 million, ADB and the \nGovernment  can  modify \ntiming  of \ncontributions under each tranche. \nFinancing is aligned with project-readiness filters. \nThe  MFF  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a  medium-term \npartnership,  thereby  creating  a  stable  financing  plan.  It \nalso mixes physical investments with advisory services. \nIndividual  contract  packages  are  significant  in  size  (albeit \nsmaller  than  with  stand-alone  projects)  and  limited  in \nnumber. This invalidates the use of a sector loan approach \nor stand-alone project modalities as alternatives.  \nA program loan would help improve policies but not capital \ninvestments,  which  are  a  binding  constraint.  An  MFF \nallows  ADB,  the  Government,  and  other  parties  to  shift \ntime and resources away from repetitive processing tasks \ninto implementation work.  \nSubsequent tranches are reasonably well defined, including \nthe nature, characteristics, location, and investment plan. \nAll  the  conditions  precedent  for  the  use  of  an  MFF  are  in \nplace: a strategic framework, a policy framework (with the \noperating  principles  and  undertakings),  an  investment \nprogram, and a tentative financing plan.  \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \nThe  energy  sector  faces  tremendous  physical  and  nonphysical \nchallenges,  including  limited  supplies  (low  generation  capacity), \nmounting \ntransmission  and  distribution  system  gaps,  rising \ntechnical  losses,  poor  rural  energy  and  electrification  coverage, \n\n \nMFF Modality \n\n \nRationale \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n(i) \n\ninclude \n\nand inadequate gas and hydropower resources units. The sector \nalso  faces  legal  and  regulatory  shortcomings,  as  well  as  gaps  in \nfinancial and management operations [especially of the executing \nagency,  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation \n(DABS)],  poor \nfinancial  management,  high  commercial  losses,  and  ineffective \nand inefficient planning and project execution. \n \nThe Government has requested ADB financial assistance over 5\u2013\n6  years.  This  assistance  is  to  be  channeled  through  the  MFF, \nwhich  will  be  converted  into  tranches  linked  to  the  readiness  of \nindividual  projects.  This  approach  is  also  followed  for  the  other \nstrategic sectors under the CPS: transport and irrigation. \n \nAn  investment  program  has  been  prepared  for  the  sector.  The \nphysical  and  nonphysical  outputs  will  lead  to  a  more  reliable \npower  system.  Physical  outputs \nrehabilitation, \naugmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  North  East  Power  System \n(NEPS);  (ii)  development  of  distribution  systems  for  load  centers \nsupplied from NEPS; (iii) increased domestic generation capacity \nthrough new off-grid greenfield small and mini hydropower plants; \nand  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  gas  fields.  Off-grid  rural  electrification  is \nbased on renewable hydropower. \n \nNonphysical outputs include (i) training for better system operation \nand  maintenance;  (ii)  better  planning,  project  management,  and \nsystems,  including  the  introduction  of  a  management  information \nsystem;  (iii)  metering,  billing,  and  collection  of  tariffs;  and  (iv) \nthematic  coverage,  including  gender  mainstreaming  and  private \nInvestment  Program  will  set  up \nsector  development.  The \nmechanisms  of  teams  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  reporting, \nand measuring results. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  lead  to  a  more  reliable  and  cost-\neffective  power  supply  for  industry  and  people,  leading  to  faster \nand  sustainable  economic  development.  The  outcome  will  be \nmore reliable generation, transmission, and distribution networks, \nand financial sustainability of DABS.  \n \nLong-term \nthe \nimmediate  term  (2008\u20132012),  the  priority  investments  are  about \n$2.3 billion. Of this, the Government asked ADB to finance up to \n$570 million. \n \n\ninvestments  are  estimated  at  $4  billion. \n\nIn \n\nPriority Investment Financing Plan \n\nInvestment Program \nAsian Development Bank \nOther Sources \n  \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n570 \n1,762 \n2,332 \n\n \n\n% \n24.4 \n75.6 \n100.0 \n\nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation \nestimates. \n\n \nInvestment Program \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nADB  will  provide  MFF  of  up  to  the  equivalent  to  $570  million  from \nthe  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF).

All  proceeds, \nexcept  those  to  be  used  by  the  Ministry  of  Mines  (MOM),  will  be \nonlent  to  DABS  with  a  32-year  tenor  including  an  8-year  grace \nperiod,  at  1%  a  year  interest  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  a \nyear  thereafter.  This  creates  a  revolving  pool  of  funds  to  help \nfinance other activities in the sector. \n \nUntil 30 June 2017 \n \n31 December 2016 \n\n \nDABS will be the Executing Agency (EA) for all projects except for \nthe Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project for which  MOM \nwill be the EA. \n \nA program management office (PMO) will be established in DABS \nto manage project execution. It will also perform due diligence on \nnew  transactions  (to  be  financed  under  subsequent  tranches). \nMOM will second staff to the PMO to help with the implementation \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Investment \nProgram Completion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nfor \n\nreporting \n\nthe  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  This \n\nof \napproach will eliminate the duplication of work by the EAs. \n \nThe  EAs  have  limited  capacity.  A  team  of  advisors  will  be \nrecruited  to  work  in  the  PMO  to  provide  project  management \nexpertise and training. To ensure EA ownership, and to realize all \noperations  efficiently,  the  PMO  will  be  structured  into  teams, \nheaded by a director with experience in project management. The \ndirector  will  report  to  the  chief  executive  officer  in  DABS  and  a \nminister  of  MOM.  ADB  will  have  direct  access  to  the  PMO  for \nbusiness  matters  and  to  MOM  and  DABS  for  policy  matters. \nTranche  1  has  earmarked  $3  million  to  cover  the  costs  of  the \nPMO. \n \nAn implementation plan has been prepared together with a facility \nadministration  manual.  These  provide  a  list  of  key  tasks  and  a \ncontract  awards  and  disbursements.  The \nforecast \nimplementation  plan  defines \nrequirements  and \ndeadlines. \n \nProcurement of works and goods to be financed under the MFF \nwill  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive bidding will be used for supply contracts estimated to \ncost more than $500,000 and for works of more than $2 million. \nNational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works \nvalued  at  more  than  $100,000  and  below  the  thresholds  for \ninternational competitive bidding. Shopping will be used for goods \nand works equal to or below $100,000. \n \nLimited international bidding may be needed for the Sheberghan \nGas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  While  this  is  not  an  ideal \nprocurement  approach,  attracting  competent  contractors  for  this \ntype  of  project  has  been  difficult \nthe  past.  Project \nimplementation has been delayed for several years.  \n \nFor  each  ADF-financed  project,  advance  contracting  for  the \nprocurement  of  equipment,  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and \nother  expenditures  will  be  permitted,  subject  to  these  being \nto  agreed  upon  procedures,  and  ADB\u2019s \neligible  according \nthe  Use  of \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nRetroactive  financing  is  proposed  under  individual  tranches  for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding financing agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% of \nthe tranche amount. The Government, MOM, and DABS have been \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  any  of  the  proposed \nprojects. \n \n\nin \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  PMO  will  require  consulting  services.  Firms  and  individuals \n(national  and  international)  will  be  engaged  to  provide  advisory \nservices  in  the  following  areas:  (i) project  management;  (ii)  due \ndiligence work (technical, commercial, financial, legal, safeguards, \ngender,  governance,  etc.)  for  subsequent  tranches;  (iii)  detailed \ndesign  engineering,  procurement,  and  supervision;  (iv) safeguard \nmanagement  and  gender  mainstreaming; \n(v)  evaluation, \nmonitoring,  auditing,  reporting,  and  measuring  results;  and  (vi) \ntraining  and  policy  advice.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the quality-based selection method.  \n \nSingle-source  selection  may  be  used  to  recruit  a  consultant  to \nhelp  with  the  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  The \nleast-cost  selection  method  will  be  used  to  recruit  external \nauditors  and  external  agencies  to  monitor  the  implementation  of \nsafeguards.  Individual  consultants  may  be  recruited  for  other \nassignments, in accordance with ADB procedures for recruitment \nof individual consultants.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  benefit  people  and  businesses. \nBenefits  are  derived  from  the  provision  of  less-expensive  and \nmore reliable electricity to a greater number of people for most of \nthe  year.  Energy  will  improve  welfare  and  accelerate  economic \ngrowth.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  have  gender-related \nbenefits,  particularly  as  household  tasks  become  less  labor \nintensive  and  job  opportunities  grow.  Household  will  benefit  by \nreducing  the  use  of  expensive  diesel-generated  electricity.  The \nInvestment Program will have minimal impact on the environment. \nIn addition to initiating environmental due diligence the Investment \nProgram will take a broader view on climate change, particularly in \nthe  context  of  energy  conservation,  clean  energy,  renewable \nenergy, and system efficiency. \n \nThe  key  assumptions  for  success  of  the  Investment  Program \ninclude  (i)  timely  implementation  of  projects,  (ii)  more  effective \nthe  policy \ninstitutions,  (iii)  a  commitment \nframework,  (iv)  stable  regulation  arrangements  and  tariff  regime, \nand (v) improvement in security. \n \nOne  of  the  main  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  is  that  the \nrestructuring  of  DABS  could  be  delayed  or  not  be  completed. \nOther  risks  include  insufficient  power  imports  from  neighboring \ncountries and inadequate project management.  \n \nThe  modernization  of  DABS  is  on  course,  although  the  process \nwill  require  a  major  political  commitment  and  working  capital \nfinancing  in  the  short  term.  Considerable  technical  assistance  is \nbeing assigned to this task from ADB and other agencies such as \nthe  World  Bank.  Electricity  supplies  from  Uzbekistan  are  not \nformally  confirmed,  although  both  parties  have  been  talking \n\nto  reforms  and \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nrecently.  Supplies  from  Tajikistan  are  scheduled  to  come  on \nstream in 2010, but will only be available between May to August. \nElectricity  supplies  from  Turkmenistan  have  not  been  formalized, \nand  the  gas  project  to  supply  Pakistan  and  India  is  only  on  the \ndrawing  board.  The  Central  Asia-South  Asia  Regional  Electricity \nMarket  Project  is  in  the  planning  stage.  This  suggests  that  a \ndomestic  supply  is  needed  to  achieve  energy  security.  Kabul \nreceives only 2\u20133 hours of electricity a day.  \n \nProject management has been a problem in the past. Capacity is \nlacking, and the systems and procedures are inefficient and slow. \nThe establishment of the PMO breaks with past practice, taking a \nholistic view of the management of project tasks and themes.  \n \nSecurity is likely to remain the most difficult problem in the short to \nmedium  term.  This  will  make  it  difficult  to  attract  investors  and \ncontractors,  and  to  implement  projects.  The  MFF  establishes \ncommunity-based,  small-scale \ninvestments  and  contingency \nfinance to pay for security. This will not address the core cause of \nthe problem, but it might reduce the risk to contractors. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f36  00'No\n\nAFGHANISTAN\nENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM\n\no\n72  00'E\n\n64  00'Eo\n\n72  00'Eo\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\n36  00'No\n\nI R A N\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nTURKMENISTAN\n\nJOWZJAN\n\nKUNDUZ\n\nTAKHAR\n\nBALKH\n\nFARYAB\n\nSAMANGAN\n\nSAR-E-PUL\n\nBAGHLAN\n\nPANJSHIR\n\nBADGHIS\nPARWAN\nAFGHANISTAN KABUL\nWARDAK\n\nBAMYAN\n\nKAPISA\n\nNURISTAN\n\nKONAR\n\nLAGHMAN\n\nKABUL\n\nNANGARHAR\n\nGHOWR\n\nDAIKONDI\n\nLOGAR\n\nPAKTIA\n\nGHAZNI\n\nKHOST\n\nHERAT\n\n32  00'No\n\nFARAH\n\nORUZGAN\n\nZABOL\n\nPAKTIKA\n\nPAKISTAN\n\n32  00'No\n\nNIMRUZ\n\nKANDAHAR\n\nHELMAND\n\n64  00'Eo\n\nTURKMENISTAN\n\no\n66  00'E\n\nKeleft\n\nJOWZJAN\n\n72  00'Eo\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n\nBADAKHSHAN\n\nFaizabad\n\nAndkhoi\n\nSheberghan\n\nBalkh\n\nNEPS Distribution Network\nKunduz (Tranche 1)\nKunduz\nKholm\n\nMazar-e-Sharif\n\nHairatan\n\nKUNDUZ\n\nBaharak Small Hydropower Plant\n and Mini-Grid (Tranche 1)\n\nTAKHAR\n\nLower Kokcha Hydropower\n(Tranches 3 and 4)\nTaloqan\n\nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line\nKunduz--Taloqan (Tranche 1)\n\nEshkashem\n\nSheberghan Gas Fields\nRehabilitation (Tranche 1)\n\nSar-e-Pul\n\nBALKH\n\nSamangan\n\nSAMANGAN\n\nBaghlan\n\nNEPS Distribution Network\nBaghlan (Tranche 1)\nPul-e-Khumri\nBAGHLAN\n\nMaimana\n\nFARYAB\n\nSAR-E-PUL\n\nDoshi\n\nPANJSHIR\nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line\nPul-e-Khumri--Chimtala  (Kabul)\nReplication (Tranche 2)\n\nNURISTAN\n\nKamdish\n\nKONAR\n\nAsadabad\n\nBAMYAN\n\nBamyan\n\nCharikar\n\nPARWAN\n\nMahmood-e-Raqi\nKAPISA\n\nLAGHMAN\nMehtar Lam\n\nChaghcharan\n\nNEPS 220 kV Chimtala (Kabul) Substation\nR eplication (Tranche 3)\n\nGHOR\n\nKhadir\n\nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line\nSouthern Extension (Tranches 2 and 3)\n\nMaidanshahr\nWARDAK\n\nJalalabad\n\nNANGARHAR\n\nTorkham\n\nKABUL\nKABUL\n\nPul-e-Alam\nLOGAR\n\nPAKTIA\n\nDAIKONDI\n\no\n66  00'E\n\nGHAZNI\n\nGhazni\n\nGardez\n\nKHOST\n\nKhost\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nMFF = Multitranche Financing Facility\nNEPS = North East Power System\nProjects under tranches 2, 3, and 4 are indicative.\n\no\n72  00'E\n\nTAJIKISTAN\n\nN\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\nKilometers\n\n36  00'No\n\nProject Province for Japan Fund for\nPoverty Reduction--Financed\nComponent (Tranche 1)\n\nGas Field Rehabilitation - MFF Project\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nHydropower Plant - MFF Project \n\nDistribution Network Rehabilitation - MFF Project\n\n220 kV Substation - MFF Project\n\n220 kV Transmission Line - Existing\n\n220 kV Transmission Line - MFF Project\n\n110 kV Transmission Line - Existing\n\n34  00'No\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\n36  00'No\n\nBADGHIS\n\n34  00'No\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n4\n1\n5\n \nH\nR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed  (i) \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF),  and  (ii)  administration  of  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  both  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Energy  Sector \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframeworks (DMFs) are in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nA. \n \nDevastated  by  decades  of  conflict,  Afghanistan  has  one  of  the  lowest  electrification \n2. \nratios  and  energy  consumption  rates  in  the  world.  An  estimated  9%  of  the  population  has \naccess  to  intermittent  public  power,  and  per  capita  electricity  consumption  is  as  low  as  21 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. Cities such as Kabul, the capital, get electricity only 2\u20133 hours a \nday.  The  shortage  of  electricity  affects  people  in  urban  and  rural  areas  alike.  It  is  a  binding \nconstraint on development.  \n \n3. \nThe Government wants to reverse the situation and has given top priority to the energy \nsector  in  its  midterm  development  program.  This  is  reflected  in  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  (ANDS), 1  which  was  approved  in  April  2008  and  submitted  to  the \ninternational community in Paris in mid-2008. The ANDS calls for investments in infrastructure \nin general, but particularly for energy security. Achieving energy security will require expanding \nand  improving  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  and  increasing  domestic  generation \ncapacity by using a mix of hydro and thermal power resources. This will not be straightforward, \nbecause  (i)  the  power  system  is  underdeveloped  and  the  existing  facilities  are  in  a  state  of \ndisrepair (some facilities are well beyond their economic life), (ii) the private sector is too small \nand uninterested in backing such large investments, and  (iii) foreign investors are deterred by \nthe deteriorating security situation. This places the responsibility mainly on a weak public sector. \nGenerating  more  power  domestically  will  take  time.  An  interim  measure  is  to  import  electricity \nfrom neighboring countries. Both the importation of electricity and the development of domestic \ncapacity  will  require  the  expansion  and  improvement  of  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems.  \n \n4. \nA  flagship  investment  is  already  in  place:  the  new  220-kilovolt  (kV)  North  East  Power \nSystem  (NEPS)  that  connects  Kabul,  Pul-e-Khumri,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Kunduz,  and  other  load \ncenters  of  northern  and  eastern  Afghanistan.  This  investment  is  vital  for  power  imports  from \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan (and later from Turkmenistan). The most important parts of the NEPS \nare being completed. A transmission line in Uzbekistan to connect to NEPS, scheduled to come \non stream in May 2009, will initially enable 150 MW of power to be supplied to Kabul and other \ncenters around NEPS.  \n \n5. \nAfghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS), established in March 2008, will be the major \nplayer in the industry. The former Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM), a department of \nthe Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), is being transformed into a new company, DABS, with \nits  own  statutes,  a  business  strategy  and  mandate,  and  an  independent  management  team. \nDABS  is  a  vertically  integrated  national  power  utility  that  will  own  and  operate  generation, \n\n                                                 \n1 Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ntransmission,  distribution  facilities,  and  the  load  dispatch. 2  Given  the  market  conditions  in \nAfghanistan, the probability of the company remaining vertically integrated is high. Since nearly \n80% of energy consumption in Afghanistan is in the form of electricity, this transformation\u2014and \nlater  the  introduction  of  better  operating  practices  at  DABS\u2014represents  an  essential  first  step \ntoward  improving  the  organization  of  the  sector.  The  outcome  must  reduce,  and  eventually \neliminate,  a  binding  constraint  to  economic  growth  in  Afghanistan  by  producing,  transmitting, \nand  distributing  more  electricity  for  more  hours  each  day  to  more  people  and  businesses  in  a \ncost-effective  and  efficient  manner.  However,  even  after  the  transformation  of  DABS  into  a \ncompany, the tasks ahead are difficult due to the complex issues that need to be resolved. \n \n6. \nThe  main  challenges  are  to  put  in  place  a  professional  and  experienced  management \nteam,  enough  working  capital  and  development  financing,  tighter  governance  systems,  and  a \nsound tariff regime to support operations. DABS will need to spin off some of its activities inherited \nfrom DABM, refocus its strategy and business plan on priority areas, and develop partnerships with \nlocal  and  international  entities.  Energy  security  will  be  a  function  of  how  well  DABS  addresses \nthose issues. DABS will need enormous support over the short to medium term.  \n \n7. \nThe  country  has  natural  gas,  coal,  and  hydropower  potential.  Gas  and  coal  resources \nhave been identified mostly in central and northern Afghanistan. However, the lack of long-term \nfunding  to  rehabilitate  dilapidated  infrastructure,  or  to  investigate  and  develop  reserves,  limits \ntheir viability. Exploration of indigenous resources and development of hydropower potential will \nstrengthen domestic generation and improve energy security. In the meantime, the country will \nhave to rely on imported power and fuels. The recent international price increases for both were \nhuge shocks for an already shaky economy and emphasized the importance of energy security.  \n \n8. \nThe Investment Program is driven by the country\u2019s strategic directions for the sector and \nby a policy framework calling for greater operational and institutional efficiency, cost recovery, \ncompetition,  transparency,  and  good  governance.  The  strategy  is  clear.  The  policy  framework \nneeds some refinements, especially regarding the tariff regime, aspects of the legal framework, \ndivestment,  and  the  energy  mix.  This  work  will  require  major  assistance.  These  shortcomings \nmust  not  stop  the  development  of  strategic  investments.  The  investment  plan  includes  short-, \nmedium-,  and  long-term  investments,  and  blends  physical  with  nonphysical  interventions.  As \nsuch, the timing of the ADB assistance makes sense.  \n \nB.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  energy  sector  faces  tremendous  challenges  which  can  be  found  in  the  detailed \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n9. \nproblem tree analysis, which is in Appendix 2.  \n \n\na. \n\nPhysical Challenges \n\n10. \nLow  Generation  Capacity.  The  total  generation  capacity  in  Afghanistan  is  only  625 \nmegawatts (MW). Actual load is assessed to be much less (about 400 MW), including 167 MW \nof  imported  power.  Hydropower  accounts  for  40%  of  the  total  capacity.  However,  because  of \ndroughts  and  reduced  river  flows,  the  country  has  resorted  to  more  expensive  and \n\n                                                 \n2 The  Afghanistan  Electricity  Organization  (DABM),  a  department  of  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW), \ncurrently  owns  and  operates  the  electricity  assets  of  the  country.  Transfer  of  assets  from  DABM  to  Afghanistan \nElectricity Corporation (DABS) is expected to be completed by March 2009. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nenvironmentally-less-friendly  options,  including  diesel  and  oil-fired  generation.  To  replace \nexpensive  diesel  and  oil  power,  the  two-pronged  strategic  plan  was  adopted:  importing \nelectricity from neighboring countries and developing domestic generation capacity. Afghanistan \nhas  an  estimated  23,000  MW  of  potential  hydropower  resources,  as  well  as  gas  and  coal \nreserves.  Major  impediments  to  tapping  such  resources  include  the  limited  financial  and \nbusiness  capacity  of  the  private  sector,  and  the  limited  interest  of  the  international  investors. \nTherefore, the public sector will need to take initiative to implement such investments. The role \nof international financing is crucial in this regard.  \n \n11. \nUnderdeveloped  and  Inefficient  Transmission  System.  The  transmission  system  is \nunderdeveloped; only major load centers are serviced. NEPS was intended to fix this problem. \nSince 2003, the aid community has committed $1 billion for such investments. While significant \nprogress was made, DABS is short on capacity and cash to maintain NEPS. An outside service \nprovider will be needed to handle project management and maintenance, as well as training of \nDABS staff to do the job. The system also needs to be expanded in the southern and western \nparts of the country where coverage is limited.  \n \n12. \nUnderdeveloped  and  Poorly  Managed  Distribution  System.  The  Government  and \nthe  development  community  has  funded  major  rehabilitation  and  expansion  works  directed  at \nthe  distribution  networks  linked  to  NEPS,  but  much  of  the  work  remains  to  be  done.  The \ndistribution  networks  in  areas  outside  NEPS  need  to  be  expanded  and  rehabilitated.  Many \nfacilities  were  destroyed  during  the  conflict;  others  have  exhausted  their  economic  life.  This \nleads  to  system  inefficiencies,  including  high  technical  losses  and  poor  customer  service  in \nterms of coverage, quality, and consistency.  \n \n13. \nHigh Losses. Total losses including technical losses are estimated at 30% of generated \nelectricity.  A  10%  loss  is  probably  acceptable  under  the  conditions  in  Afghanistan,  but  the \nbalance translates into $30 million a year in financial losses.3 This is too high for a country with \nfinancial problems and limited electricity coverage. Unless the situation is addressed, it will put \nDABS\u2019s  financial  sustainability  at  risk.  It  will  undermine  its  ability  to  service  consumers  and \nmake future investments. The alternative is rising subsidies and a deteriorating fiscal situation. \nThe budget is already stressed because of declining tax revenues.  \n \n14. \nLimited Rural Energy and Geographical Electrification Coverage. Many parts of the \ncountry do not have any electricity service coverage. Where there is coverage, the systems are \npoorly  maintained.  The  multi  aid  agency-funded  National  Solidarity  Program  (NSP),  managed \nby  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development,  is  a  flagship  initiative  on  rural \nelectrification. The NSP supports electrification schemes with installed capacity typically below \n25 kilowatts (kW). Although this fills only a small part of the energy gap in these areas, it is a \ngood  initiative.  Larger  schemes  are  planned,  but  most  have  not  come  on  stream.  The \nRenewable  Energy  and  Rural  Electrification  Subcommittee  was  established  under  the  Inter-\nMinisterial  Commission  for  Energy  (ICE)  in  September  2008  to  address  this  issue.  ADB  is \nproviding  technical  assistance.  Service  coverage  in  rural  areas  is  important  because  that  is \nwhere the bulk of the population lives.  \n \n15. \nUntapped Natural Gas Reserves. Afghanistan has natural gas resources, but the physical \ninfrastructure supporting their development has been destroyed or is dilapidated. The Government \nis considering rehabilitating domestic gas wells, which would improve the gas supply to consumers, \n\n                                                 \n3  Based on 20% of a total of 1,162.3 gigawatt-hours of power in 2005, or 232.5 megawatt-hours at $0.12 per kWh. \n\nSource: Ministry of Energy and Water. Forthcoming. MEW Power Sector Strategy. Kabul. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nand  provide  potential  fuel  for  development  of  new  generation  capacity  to  supply  NEPS.  The \nMinistry  of  Mines  (MOM)  has  sought  external  assistance  to  rehabilitate  gas  fields  for  the \ndevelopment of gas-fired power plants. However, MOM has had limited success, largely because it \nhas  been  difficult  to  find  interested  investors  and  contractors.  Plans  are  under  way  to  develop  a \nnumber of fields. In the longer run, gas is an interesting alternative in the energy mix.  \n \n16. \nUntapped Coal Reserves. The production rates for the coal industry are very low owing to \nyears of neglect. Until the end of 2006, the development of coal resources was restricted primarily \nto  two  state-owned  enterprises,  with  oversight  by  MOM.  Some  lease  arrangements  with  private \noperators have been put in place since then. In May 2007, the Government also established the \nCoal Commission, which is responsible primarily for looking into industrial demand and instruments \nwith coal as a fuel source. However, no programmatic assistance has been provided to the coal \nsector. This area needs attention, albeit through investments using clean coal technology.  \n \n\nb. \n\n Nonphysical Challenges  \n\n17.  Weak  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  Many  institutions  are  engaged  in  different \nparts  of  the  energy  sector,  which  has  made  coordination  difficult.  Legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks  are  in  place.  However,  the  institutions  behind  them  are  weak  and  at  times \ndisconnected from DABS, the company producing, transporting, and distributing electricity. This \nhas resulted in a weak energy industry that is technically deficient in planning and design. The \nbusiness environment is also unsound. The tariff regime is unpredictable, making cost recovery \nproblematic.  To  resolve  these  issues,  a  multisector  regulatory  body  was  established  early  in \n2008, with a mandate to improve policy coordination and information. DABS needs assistance \non systems and procedures operations, as well as project management.  \n\n \n\n18. \nCorporatization  of  DABS  and  Commercialization  of the Energy  Sector.   In 2008, the \nCabinet  approved  the  reorganization  of  DABM  into  a  Government-owned  company  (DABS) \nmandated to operate under the Commercial Code and other laws applicable to private entities. The \nGovernment  backed  this  with  a  divestment  strategy,  due  to  begin  in  2009,  for  the  liquidation, \nrestructuring, commercialization, and sale of energy assets under state control. The corporatization \nof DABM into DABS is a positive step, but more work is needed to see that it succeeds. High levels \nof assistance are necessary.  \n \n19. \nBad  Financial  Performance  of  DABS.  The  Government  doubled  electricity  tariffs  in \n2006. 4  This  has  to  a  certain  extent  defrayed  diesel  costs  and  will  help  DABS  financially. \nHowever, the tariff regime was inadequate to start with, and DABS is expected to carry a heavy \nfinancial  burden  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  Capital  injections  and  further  increases  in  real \ntariffs will be required to ensure cost recovery.5 DABS also needs to become more effective, cut \ncosts, improve billing and tariff collection, and urgently reduce huge technical and commercial \nlosses compared to DABM\u2019s past performance. \n  \n20. \nCommercial  Losses  and  Low  Collection  Rate. Commercial losses in the system are \ncaused  mainly  by  theft,  and  unbilled  energy  while  collection  rates  are  low.  It  is  estimated  that \nonly 60% of billings are collected. These problems translate to a financial loss of approximately \n$45  million  a  year.  If  this  is  combined  with  total  losses  of  $30  million  per  year  (para.  13),  the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  DABS  is  in  doubt.  In  addition  to  investments  in  the  system,  better \nbusiness and management practices are needed.  \n\n                                                 \n4 From an average of $0.0416/kWh to $0.0830/kWh \n5 ADB estimates that the final average tariff to consumers after 2009 will be $0.12\u2013$0.14 per kWh.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n21. \nLack of  Qualified  Staff.  Low salaries and the loss of experts during the conflict have left \nthe  industry  without  enough  experienced  professionals  with  the  right  operational,  financial \nmanagement,  and  technical  skills.  Current  salaries  of  engineers  at  DABM  are  less  than  10%  of \nmarket  rates  in  the  country,  which  inhibits  DABS  in  hiring  and  retaining  staff.  High  staff  turnover \nmakes  capacity  development  a  challenge.  The  situation  is  unlikely  to  change  in  the  short  to \nmedium  term,  which  implies  a  higher-than-average  level  of  support  during  the  implementation  of \nprojects and for longer periods than would otherwise be the case.  \n \n22. \nTighter Aid Agency Coordination. The energy sector is currently overseen by an array \nof  ministries,  agencies  and  government  organizations.  This  resulted  in  inefficient  allocation  of \nforeign  assistance  leading  to  gaps  and  overlaps  in  the  development  of  the  sector.  ICE  was, \ntherefore, established to function as a centralized coordination body.6 Chaired by the Minister of \nEconomy, the ICE includes MEW, MOM, and the Ministry of Finance as core members. The ICE \naims  to  help  the  Government  design  and  monitor  energy  development  strategies  based  on \ncommercial  principles. \ninvestment \nprogramming, and coordinates the work of development partners. \n \n\nIt  oversees  energy  sector  policy  and \n\ninfrastructure \n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\nThe  Afghanistan  energy  sector  strategy  is  a  by-product  of  ANDS  and  was  formulated \n23. \nbased  on  assessments  done  in  recent  years.  The  strategy  highlights  key  problems  and \nopportunities, and recognizes the challenges ahead. It proposes a vision for the future and actions \nto  deliver  larger  and  more  reliable  supplies,  better  and  larger  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks, and more efficient institutions, by developing new legal and regulatory frameworks, and \nadditional  finance.  The  strategy  outlines  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets  and  focuses  on  four \nareas: (i) development of new operations and running of existing ones efficiently, (ii) improvements \nin governance, (iii) expansion of rural electrification and development of renewable energy, and (iv) \ndevelopment of effective institutions. The energy sector strategy is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n\n3. \n\nTargets \n\nThe  objective  of  the  strategy  is  to  get  close  to,  or  surpass,  the  following  benchmarks \n24. \nprojected  under  the  Afghanistan  Compact 7 by  2010:  (i)  electricity  to  reach  at  least  65%  of \nhouseholds  in  major  urban  areas,  (ii)  electricity  to  reach  at  least  90%  of  non-residential \nestablishments  in  major  urban  areas,  (iii)  at  least  25%  of  rural  households  to  have  access  to \nelectricity, and (iv) at least 75% cost recovery from national power grid.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEnergy Sector Investment Program \n\nThe Government produced a development master plan in 2004, which is outdated and \n25. \nhas  been  revised.  A  new  energy  sector  investment  program  has  been  developed,  which  has \nidentified projects; several projects have been assigned to different development partners. This \nwork has been managed through the ICE. The current Investment Program will cost more than \n$4  billion  up  to  2015  while  the  shorter-term  Investment  Program  will  cost  approximately  $2.3 \nbillion.  ADB  has  been  asked  to  finance  a slice of  the  Investment  Program.  The  financing  plan \nremains  tentative,  although  aid  agencies  such  as  the  World  Bank  are  committed  to  specific \ntransactions. ADB will take a programmatic approach to financing by using an MFF.   \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2007.

London. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n26. \nThe  NEPS  has  been  the  focus  of  external  assistance  in  the  energy  sector.  Major \ndevelopment partners include ADB, India, German development cooperation through KfW, United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), and World Bank (Appendix 4). An account \nof past performance is not possible as few projects have been evaluated. This also applies to ADB. \nThrough  development  agencies\u2019  discussions  prevalent  in  the  ICE  meetings  and  joint  portfolio \nreviews by different aid agencies which have commenced in the past, it has been clarified that the \nportfolios have several common characteristics in strategy and lessons learned (paras. 27\u201331).  \n \n\n6. \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy  \n\nThe  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2006-2008  for  Afghanistan  places \n27. \nenergy sector development as one of its top priorities. Transport, which accounts for the bulk of \nthe current portfolio, will remain a priority ADB operations governed by the CSPU under which \nADB  provided  financial  and  advisory  assistance  to  transport,  energy,  and  agriculture. 8 The \nrehabilitation  of  power  infrastructure,  particularly  transmission  and  distribution  lines,  and  the \nestablishment  of  a  national  power  transmission  grid  were  priorities  in  the  energy  sector.  The \nADB program also focused on facilitation of power trading and interconnection with neighboring \ncountries.  Similarly,  ADB  has  supported  the  development  of  hydropower  and  natural  gas \nthrough technical assistance. \n \n28. \nThe  Country  Partnership  Strategy  (CPS)  for  Afghanistan  (2009-2013),  which  will  be \nconsidered  early  in  2009,  makes  energy  the  top  priority.  The  new  strategy  for  the  sector \nrepresents  a  continuation  of  the  format.  The  objective  remains  broadly  the  same,  but  the \nbusiness model is different. Investments and institutions are supported in a more programmatic \nfashion  through  the  combination  of  physical  and  nonphysical  investments.  The  new  strategy \nattaches  special  importance  to  themes,  particularly  gender  and  development  for  gender \nmainstreaming,  capacity,  governance,  and  private  sector  development.  The  strategy  is  also \naligned with a regional cooperation and integration plan. ADB has three flagship projects in this \narea, one approved and two in development. The ADB strategy is in line with the ANDS and is \nsupported by the Government.  \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons  \n\n29. \nADB  has  several  ongoing  projects.  None  has  yet  been  evaluated  independently  by  the \nOperations  Evaluation  Department. Nevertheless,  based on internal  portfolio reviews and project \nperformance reports prepared by country and sector teams, several lessons can be highlighted: \n \n\nMost projects have been prone to cost overruns and are far behind schedule. This \nis  a  function  of  bad  security  and  rising  investment  costs  (because  of  higher \ninternational  materials  and equipment prices, and  a  rising security cost premium). \nHowever, some projects would have benefited from better planning and design, as \nwell as more realistic cost estimates.  \n\nMost transactions failed to attract the interest of top contractors, largely because of \nthe  security  situation.  This  has  led  to  higher-than-expected  bid  prices,  resulting  in \nfinancing gaps. However, more and better marketing of the business opportunities \nmight have helped. \n\n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nThe  use  of  design-build  approaches  has  merits,  but  when  only  one  contractor  is \nbidding it also has risks. This has led to changes in project scope, sometimes with \ndubious  justification.  The  Government  often  responded  positively  to  change \nrequests, leading to financial commitments that it was not able to always meet. This \nwas also prevalent in transport projects. The inability to make good on commitments \nhas put contracts at risk, and ADB has often been asked to come to the rescue.  \n\nADF  is  the  only  means  ADB  has  to  do  business  in  Afghanistan.  The  current \nallocation arrangements, which require funds to be pledged to projects within a given \nfiscal  year,  may  have  contributed  to  two  problems:  (a)  larger-than-needed \ntransactions, and (b) the delinking of financing plans from project readiness. This has \nresulted in cost overruns and ultimately the restructuring of projects and financings. \nThe  ADF  allocation  system  does  not  need  to  be  changed  because  of  this;  the \nreliance on stand-alone projects does. Specifically, a programmatic approach for all \npriority activities under the CPS might be a better way to deal with this problem.  \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe approval of investment projects without proper power purchase agreements \n(PPAs)  up  front  is  a  bad  practice.  This  is  the  situation  with  the  power \ninterconnection  with  Uzbekistan.  Although  the  situation  is  being  managed,  the \nmain  lesson  is  not  to  start  regional  projects  without  formal  commercial \nagreements in place.  \n\n \n30. \nAnother  lesson  is  that  projects  must  have  better  and  more  detailed  implementation \nplans,  as  well  as  project  implementation  manuals  up  front.  As  the  institutional  capacity  in  the \ncountry  is  weak,  local  teams  cannot  be  expected  to  start  things  from  scratch.  This  leads  to \nstartup  delays.  In  addition,  sound  organizational  arrangements  are  lacking  at  the  level  of  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs). A more holistic project management approach ought to replace the \nstandard  project  management  unit  concept.  The  standard  approach  works  for  some  projects, \nbut the institutional memory disappears once these are completed. The combination of project \nmanagement  with  the  execution  of  institutional  reforms  linked  to  the  sector  and  the  projects \nmakes  more  sense.  This  is  especially  important  in  financing  channeled  through  MFFs.  With \nregard to ADB oversight, recent experience has shown that the resident mission in Kabul and \nthe teams at headquarters need to work more closely together from the outset. The concept of \n\u201cdelegated\u201d  and  \u201cnon-delegated\u201d  projects  does  not  work  well  if  this  disconnects  technical  and \nadministrative  tasks,  responsibilities,  and  accountabilities.  A  joint  venture  approach  might \novercome this problem.  \n \n31. \nThe capacity of the resident mission has also been a problem. The office has dedicated \nprofessionals, but it needs more experienced project management expertise, and more efficient \nsystems and procedures, including project administration oversight and reporting. The skills mix \ndeficiency is being corrected through the redeployment of new experts to the field, and through \nnew leadership. A detailed action plan to correct other weaknesses has been defined and will \nbe implemented in full shortly.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n32. \nThe expected impact of the Investment Program will be a larger and more cost-effective \npower supply to all customers, resulting in sustainable economic development. The outcome of \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe Investment Program will be (i) reliable generation, transmission, and distribution networks; \n(ii)  financial  sustainability  of  DABS;  and  (iii)  better  power  sector  regulation  and  overall \ninstitutional effectiveness.  \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\nThe Investment Program will create a more reliable power system. This will be a function \n33. \nof  (i)  the  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  NEPS;  (ii)  development  of \ndistribution systems at load centers supplied from the NEPS; and (iii) more domestic generation \ncapacity through on- and off-grid small and mini greenfield hydropower plants, and rehabilitation \nof  gas  fields.  Off-grid  rural  electrification  programs  will  rely  on  the  development  of  renewable \nhydropower, providing rural population access to electricity. \n \n34. \nOther  outputs  of  the  Investment  Program  will  include  (i)  better  system  operation  and \nmaintenance; and (ii) enhanced planning and project management, including the introduction of \nmanagement  information  system  (MIS)  and  better  metering,  billing,  and  collection  of  tariffs. \nDABS will be a target for assistance. A PMO will be established to undertake (i) technical work \n(design  and  supervision);  (ii)  provide  legal  services  (contracts  and  bidding  processes);  (iii) \nsafeguard  management  and  gender  mainstreaming;  (iv)  finance  and  administration  (to  tighten \nup  on  systems,  procedures,  funding,  audits,  controls,  records,  and  cash  management);  (v) \nreporting, evaluations, and results measurement; and (vi) technical assistance to train staff on \nproject management, planning, policy refinements, and investment program development. The \nPMO will also have due diligence experts to prepare the next generation of priority investments. \nThe  office  will  also  have  a  communications  function.  The  intention  is  to  work  on  broad \ninstitutional matters, while addressing day-to-day operational and project execution.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram Outputs \n\n35. \nTranche 1. Physical outputs will include (i) rehabilitating distribution systems in the northern \ncities  of  Kunduz  and  Baghlan,  (ii)  constructing  a  new  220  kV  transmission  line  from  Kunduz  to \nTaloqan,  (iii)  small  and  mini  hydropower  plants  in  Badakhshan  and  Bamyan  Provinces,  and  (iv) \nrehabilitating gas fields in Sheberghan. Nonphysical outputs will include (i) the establishment and \noptimal functioning of the PMO, (ii) development of a management information system to efficiently \nmanage the Program, and (iii) capacity building and training for effective management, operation \nand  maintenance  of  NEPS,  as  well  as  project  management  (procurement,  contract  awards, \nsupervision,  and  design  work),  due  diligence  for  new  projects,  safeguard  management,  gender \nmainstreaming  work  for  all  tranches,  finance  and  administration  controls,  and  basic  training.  All \nadvisory  packages  will  be  supported  by  consulting  services  mandates.  Details  of  physical  and \nnonphysical outputs of the Tranche 1 Project are in Appendix 5. \n \n36. \nSubsequent  Tranches.  Subsequent  tranches  will  build  on  the  results  of  tranche  1. \nIndicative  physical  outputs  will  include  rehabilitating  and  constructing  of  transmission  lines, \ndistribution  systems,  and  new  hydropower  generation.  The  three  additional  tranches  will  expand \nNEPS to  the south of  Kabul  where  connection  to the national  grid is badly  needed.  Nonphysical \noutputs will include (i) development of a metering program in load centers covered by NEPS, (ii) \nintroduction and upgrading of DABS\u2019s billing system, (iii) development of an action plan to improve \ntariff collection, and (iv) institutional strengthening and capacity building of DABS with the objective \nof enabling the company to operate on a commercial basis. Descriptions of indicative projects to be \nfinanced under subsequent tranches are in Appendix 6. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nMultitranche Financing Facility Modality \n\n \nC. \n \n37. \nThe  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  modality  to  extend  ADB  financing  to  the  Investment \nProgram.  The  following  seven  points  clearly  demonstrates  the  justification  of  using  the  MFF \nmodality: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  modality  provides  flexibility  to  ADB  and  the  Government.  Within  the \nproposed  maximum  financing  of  $570  million,  ADB  and  the  Government  can \nmodify the amount and timing of ADB contributions under each tranche. This is \nimportant  in  case  the  Government  can  raise  additional  financing  from  other \nsources (such as the private sector or other aid agencies), or if the Government \nneeds more time to finalize specific project packages. The other key element is \nthat the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely linked to the availability \nof  resources  within  ADB,  and \nfull  compliance  with  warranties  and \nrepresentations made under the framework financing agreement (FFA). \n\nto \n\nFinancing  under  the  MFF  can  be  aligned  to  specific  technical,  safeguard,  legal, \nand  other  project-readiness  filters.  The  authorities  can  make  loan  conversions \nunder  the  MFF  as  and  when  projects  are  ready  for  execution.  This  approach \nfacilitates  advance  actions,  including  documentation  preparation,  and  the \nestablishment  of  relevant  administrative  arrangements.  The  MFF  also  allows \nADB, the Government, and its partners to link more closely financing to changes \nin the cost of projects bundled under each tranche. This avoids cost overruns. \n\nThe  MFF  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a  medium-term  partnership  with  the \nGovernment  and  DABS,  establishing  stability  and  credibility  at  the  level  of  the \nfinancing  plan.  The  MFF  mixes  physical  investments  with  advisory  services. \nAdvisory  services  include  financing  to  advance  work  on  capacity  and  policy \nactions, which can be precursors to making physical investments. \n\nThe  individual  contract  packages  are  smaller  than  stand-alone  operations, \nalthough they are still substantial, and limited in number. This invalidates a sector \nloan  approach  and  stand-alone  project  modalities  as  alternatives.  However,  the \nstate  of  energy  facilities  is  poor,  impairing  energy  security  and  economic \nperformance.  The  efficiency  gains  would  not  be  the  same  if  any  of  these  other \nmodalities  were  used.  The  MFF  will  also  lower  costs,  although  this  is  not  the \nmain by-product. \n\nA  program  loan  would  help  improve  policies  but  not  capital  investments,  which \nare  a  binding  constraint.  By  channeling  funding  through  an  MFF,  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and other parties can shift time and resources away from repetitive \nprocessing tasks into implementation work.  \n\nSubsequent \ncharacteristics, location, and investment plan. \n\ntranches  are  reasonably  well  defined, \n\nincluding \n\nthe  nature, \n\nAll the conditions precedent for the use of an MFF are in place: strategy or road \nmap,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  financing  plan.  The  modality \nalso  moves  the  analytical  work  up  front,  leaving  resources  and  multiple  entry \npoints  for  ADB  and  its  partners  to  focus  on  execution,  capacity,  and  reforms. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n38. \n \n\nADB  and  its  partners  have  agreed  upon  decision-making  criteria  and  filters  for \nthe provision of financing, including specific warranties and representations and \ncovenants leading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n\nThe status of MFF preconditions is as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nStrategy.  The  strategic  framework  or  road  map  is  sound.  The  main  components \nare provided with the expected results. \n\nPolicy  framework.  The policy framework is less solid than the strategy and will \nneed  refinements.  However,  the  main  building  blocks  are  in  place.  DABS  and \nMOM  need  to  ensure  that  the  main  principles  are  adhered  to:  cost  recovery; \nrecurrent  expenditure  financing;  best  practice  approaches  on  safeguards, \ngovernance,  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  measures; \nfurther  sector  restructuring;  introduction  of  a  firmer  tariff  regime;  and  better \nproject management and agency accountability. \n\nInvestment  Program.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  medium- \nterm \ninvestment  program  calling  for  investments  of  about  $4  billion.  Short-term \ninvestment  priorities  will  cost  about  $2.3  billion.  Both  short  and  medium-term \ninvestment program are shown in Table 1. \n\nFinancing plan. The overall program of investments still lacks a firm financing plan, \nalthough  the  short-term  package  has  firmer  plans.  ADB  is  one  of  the  financiers, \ntogether with Japan (through JFPR), USAID, KfW, the European Union, India, Iran, \nIslamic  Development  Bank,  and  World  Bank.  If  financing  is  not  secured,  the \nInvestment Program will still continue but at a slower pace. The national budget and \nthe private sector are not serious financing options.  \n\nEnergy Sector Investment Program \n\n \nD. \n \n39. \nInvestment requirements in the energy sector for the medium term total about $4 billion. \nOf  this,  some  $2.3  billion  are  the  more  pressing  investments  (Table  1).  The  Government  has \nasked ADB to take a slice of this smaller program and to support it over 4\u20135 years through an \nMFF. The amount proposed is $570 million (Table 2). A set of investments have been prepared. \nThese are to be done in four tranches, with the first totaling $164 million (Table 3). Details of the \ncost estimates of this MFF and tranche 1 components are in Appendix 7.  \n \n\nTable 1: Medium-Term and Priority Energy Sector Investment Program \n($ million) \n\n Item \nInstitutional \nGeneration \nTransmission \nDistribution \nTotal \nSource: Afghanistan Electricity Corporation estimates. \n\nMedium \nTerm \n97 \n1,993 \n1,386 \n717 \n4,195 \n\nPriority \nInvestments\n\n93 \n756 \n960 \n523 \n2,332 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nTranche \n2 \n\nTranche \n3 \n\nTranche \n4 \n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates for Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n\n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n\n \n\nProject Name \n\nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Kunduz\u2013Taloqan \nNEPS Distribution Network: Kunduz \nNEPS Distribution Network: Baghlan \nNEPS 220 kV System Operation and Maintenance \nBaharak Small Hydropower Plant and Mini-Grid \nSheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation \nProject Management (Consulting Services) \nPreparation of Tranches 2 and 3 (Consulting Services) \nNEPS 220 kV TL Replication: Pul-e-Khumri\u2013Chimtala \nDABS Institutional Capacity Development (MIS, Metering, \nBilling, Collection) \nProject Management and Due Diligence \nNEPS 220 kV TL: Southern Extension  \nNEPS 220 kV Chimtala 160 MVA Substation Replication \nLower Kokcha River Hydropower Plant Phase II \nProgram Management Office Support \nTranche 1 Contingency \n\nTranche Subtotal \nInvestment Program Total \n\nTranche \n1 \n26.4 \n18.9 \n12.4 \n29.8 \n22.1 \n25.4 \n7.5 \n2.5 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3.0 \n16.0 \n164.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n80.0 \n10.0 \n\n5.0 \n55.0 \n \n \n \n \n150.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n21.0 \n35.0 \n44.0 \n \n \n100.0 \n\n \n \n \n156.0 \n \n \n156.0 \n\n570.0 \n\nDABS = Afghanistan Electricity Corporation, kV = kilovolt, MIS = management information systems, MVA = megavolt-\nampere, NEPS = North East Power System, No. = number, TL = transmission line.  \nNotes:  \n(i) The table excludes taxes and duties payable by the Government.  \n(ii) Program management office support includes recurrent costs such as bank charges.  \n(iii) Projects under tranches 2, 3, and 4 are indicative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 3: Priority Investments Assigned to ADB (including JFPR)  \n($ million) \n\n \n\nInfrastructure \nInstitutional (including PMO Support) \n\nComponent \n1. \n2. \n3.

The implementation period will be 8 years. The Investment Program will consist of \nindividual  tranches,  which  terms  may  vary.  The  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment  and \ngoods,  consulting  services,  and  recurrent  costs.  All  proceeds,  except  those  to  be  utilized  by \nMOM,  will  be  relent  to  DABS  with  a  tenor  of  32  years,  including  an  8-year  grace  period,  and \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2005.

Specific methodology shall be agreed during the implementation of \nthe Investment Program within two years after grant effectiveness of tranche 1. \n \n42. \nThe Government will submit a periodic financing request (PFR) for each tranche, which \nwill be reviewed by ADB in accordance with the FFA. If approved, financing will come from the \nMFF. The Government has submitted the first PFR, requesting $164 million to help finance tranche \n1 project. The terms and conditions for subsequent tranches will be subject to (i) the availability of \nADB  Special  Funds  resources;  (ii)  Afghanistan\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nGraduation Policy and the requirement of the ADF donors; and (iii) the availability of ADB Special \nFunds resources to Afghanistan pursuant to then-applicable policies concerning allocation of, and \neligibility  for,  such  funds.  Adherence  to  undertakings  made  in  the  FFA  and  individual  tranche \nfinancing agreement covenants will be conditions for financing approval.  \n \nThe  last  date  for  any  disbursements  under  any  tranche  will  be  by  30  June  2017. \n43. \nAfghanistan is expected to submit the last PFR no later than 31 December 2012.

Nonphysical tasks agreed \nupon  that  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  outputs  expected  from  the  Investment  Program  (e.g., \nassumptions and mitigation of risks in the DMF pertaining to the Government and the EAs, such \nas tariff and security issues) will be primary factors in ADB decisions. \n\n. \n\nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nManagement of the Investment Program \n\nDABS  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program, \n48. \nexcept for the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project, for which MOM will be the EA. A \nPMO will be established in DABS to manage the implementation of all projects. This will include \ndue diligence for new transactions under the Investment Program. Staff will be seconded from \nMOM to the PMO to help implement the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project. \n \n49. \nGiven  the  limited  capacity  and  resources  of  the  EAs,  significant  assistance  will  be \nrequired to implement the Investment Program in a timely manner. The PMO will be supported \nby  a  core  team  of  advisers  recruited  from  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  These \nadvisers  will  help  execute  projects,  handle  themes,  and  provide  training.  The  PMO  will  be \nmanaged  by  a  director  with  experience  in  project  management.  The  PMO  will  be  divided  into \nteams,  each  with  a  leader  and  experts  to  provide  specific  support.  The  PMO  will  also  have  a \nbudget  line  to  engage  the  services  of  long-  and  short-term  experts.  Details  of  the  PMO \nmandates are in Appendix 9. The teams are as follows: \n \n\nDirector (front office). The person in charge of the PMO will be engaged for at \nleast  5  years  and  will  be  given  a  mandate  to  run  the  PMO  daily  operations \nwithout Government interference. The director will report to the chief executive of \nDABS. The director will have track record and project management expertise.  \n\nTechnical. An expert in energy and power engineering will lead this team, which \nwill  also  include  experts  on  transmission  and  distribution,  hydropower,  and  gas \nsector  operations.  Its  mandate  will  be  to  deal  with  all  operational  or  technical \nmatters during implementation, handle design work on subsequent tranches, and \nsupervise contracts. The team will provide inputs on the procurement documents \nand  help  pre-qualify  and  qualify  bidders  as  well  as  evaluate  bids  in  conjunction \nwith other teams (including the legal team). \n\nLegal.  This  team  will  provide  legal  oversight,  including  on  the  preparation  of \nprocurement documents, bidding management, prequalification and qualification \nof  contractors  and/or  investors,  bid  awards,  preparation  of  contract  documents, \ncontract  variations,  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  FFA  undertakings  and  loan \ncovenants.  The  legal  team  will  provide  checks  and  balances,  and  introduce \nquality control and fiduciary oversight. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\nFinance  and  administration.  This  will  be  one  of  the  most  important  functions \nfrom the point of view of funds management, fiduciary oversight, record keeping, \naudits, and reporting. The team will be managed by a person with a track record \nin  financial  management.  All  withdrawal  applications,  bank  accounts,  and \npayment  instructions  will  be  channeled  through  this  team.  ADB  will  provide \ntraining  on  financing  management,  anticorruption  works,  controller  functions, \nrecord keeping and reporting. \n\nSafeguard  and  gender  mainstreaming.  This  team  will  review  all  new  project \ndesigns, assist in the processing, check on the implementation work, and report \non  the  compliance  of  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  procedures.  Given  the \nimportance  of  gender  mainstreaming,  the  team  will  engage  the  services  of \nexperts on the subject. ADB will have direct access to this team for the purposes \nof monitoring performance on these Tranches. \n\nDue  diligence.  The  PMO  will  engage  experts  to  help  prepare  of  new  projects \nunder  the  Investment  Program.  This  team  will  be  involved  with  technical,  legal, \nfinancial,  commercial,  economic,  social,  safeguard,  governance,  and  other \nmatters. ADB will provide guidance and support regarding criteria, and rules and \nprocedures. \n\n(vii)  Results measurement. The PMO will outsource the measurement of results to a \nlocal institute. The methodology for this work is being worked out. ADB will work \ndirectly  with  the  institute  to  ensure  that  the  approach  is  consistent  with  others \nadopted for energy projects. \n\n(viii)  Communications.  The  PMO  will  engage  the  services  of  a  team  to  provide \nregular communications support. The work will include developing a strategy and \naction plan. ADB will provide guidance and support with respect to outcomes and \noutputs. The idea is to communicate actions being taken, as well as successes. \n\nCapacity  building.  One of the most important components of the PMO work is \nthe establishment of an advisory team to help DABS, MOM, and other institutions \ninvolved in the sector to do their jobs better. Training will include sector planning \nand  project  management,  financial  management,  policy  works,  and  DABS \nrestructuring  (including  commercial  and  operational  assistance).  The  team  will \nwork with a pool of Afghan nationals, at least two in each critical task, who will be \nseconded from both DABS and MOM. The idea is to have enough critical mass \nto  handle  work  on  accounts  of  high  staff  turnover  during  the  operation  of  the \nPMO.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n50. \nThe Investment Program is scheduled for execution over 8 years, including procurement \nand construction activities. All priority investments and institutional support will be completed by \n31 December 2016 at the latest. The MFF utilization period is until 30 June 2017. The physical \nimplementation  of  tranche  1  will  be  completed  by  31  December  2013.  An  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Plan and Project Readiness \n\n51. \nImplementation Plan. A detailed implementation plan for tranche 1 (Appendix 11), backed \nby a facility administration manual (Supplementary Appendix M) has been prepared. These plans \nwill be given to the PMO as a reference to kick-start implementation. A management information \nsystem  (MIS)  will  be  set  up  to  record  and  report  information  for  management  decisions.  ADB \nprogram supervision teams will use the same MIS. The implementation plan has contract awards \nand disbursement projections. The subsequent tranche projects are also identified, including their \nnature, characteristics, and locations.  \n \n52. \nProject Readiness. Preliminary designs or feasibility studies have been prepared for all \ntranche 1 projects, except for the JFPR cofinanced mini hydropower plants in Badakhshan and \nBamyan  provinces.  The  identification,  selection,  planning,  and  design  of  potential  mini \nhydropower  sites  under  JFPR  will  be  carried  out  in  the  first  half  of  2009.  This  will  require \ntechnical assistance to be financed by JFPR. Subsequent tranche projects have been identified, \nbut the final due diligence on them will be conducted under tranche 1. The Investment Program \nis  precise  in  terms  of  the  location  and  nature  of  projects.  The  investment  plan  has  also  been \nworked  out,  but  further  due  diligence  is  needed.  In  particular,  safeguard  compliance  requires \nspecial studies for each of the projects and safeguard plans. These will be done as part of the \ndue diligence process.  \n \n53. \nFor  all  tranche  1  projects,  due  diligence  has  been  performed  to  assess  their  technical, \neconomical, and financial viability. The concurrence of the Government and EAs were obtained \nfor  all  tranche  1  projects.  The  Government  also  agreed  with  the  tentative  list  of  subsequent \ntranche  projects.  All  tranche  1  projects  involving  physical  investment  have  been  classified  as \ncategory B in terms of environmental impact, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports \nhave  been  prepared.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  plans  have  been  prepared  for \nprojects that involve such issues. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nand  a  LAR  framework  have  been  prepared  for  the  JFPR,  because  project  details  will  be \navailable only during implementation in 2009.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n54. \nProcurement  of  works  and  goods  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational competitive bidding will generally be used for supply contracts estimated to cost more \nthan $500,000 and for works that cost more than $2 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) \nwill  be  used  for  goods  and  works  above  $100,000  and  below  their  international  competitive \nbidding thresholds. Shopping will be used for goods and works equal to or below $100,000. \n \nIn tranche 1, limited international bidding (LIB) is envisaged to procure a contractor for \n55. \nthe  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project.  Bidding  for  this  project  failed  on  several \noccasions since 2004 to the present because of no interest expressed by third parties.11 USAID \nhas encountered the same problem in seeking bidders for more or less identical works in a field \nadjacent to Sheberghan. After several failed bid attempts, USAID finally issued a contract to a \nfirm in August 2008\u2014roughly 2 years after initiating the bid. One scenario for Sheberghan is to \nwork  with  the  same  USAID-funded  contractor,  which  will  require  LIB.  This  approach  is  not \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nenvisaged  for  subsequent  tranche  projects,  although  it  cannot  be  ruled  out.  LIB  will  only  be \nused in exceptional circumstances, always backed by proper due diligence and following due \nprocess with respect to ADB procurement rules.  \n \n56.  While the procurement plan for the Investment Program as a whole is still tentative, the \nplan for tranche 1 is firm (Appendix 12). It will be updated every 6\u201312 months, covering the next \n18  months  of  procurement  activities.  Section  3  of  the  procurement  plan  summarizes  the \nmodifications or clarifications to the Government's procedures that are needed to carry out NCB \nunder ADB financing. The PMO will work on this aspect through its technical and legal teams.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The quality-based selection method \nwill  generally  be  used  to  attract  interest  from  qualified  firms,  which  tend  to  avoid  cost \ncompetition  in  a  volatile  environment.  ADB  has  had  experiences  in  Afghanistan  with \nsubstandard consultants being recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method. \nThis resulted in poor quality work, delays, and cost overruns. Controlling progress, quality, cost, \nand  safety  of  construction  works  in  Afghanistan  is  widely  recognized  as  a  difficult  task.  The \nperformance  of  the  consultant  affected  significantly  the  quality  of  the  output.  The  quality  of \nconsulting services is a success factor. \n \n58. \nFor tranche 1, single-source selection is proposed for the recruitment of implementation \nconsultants during the Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project for the reasons as those \njustifying  LIB.  Individual  consultants  may  also  need  to  be  recruited  for  specific  assignments \nunder  the  PMO  mandate,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  recruitment  of  individual \nconsultants.  The  least-cost  selection  method  will  be  used  to  recruit  external  auditors  and \nexperts to monitor the implementation of safeguard plans. The procurement plan with tentative \nconsulting services for the Investment Program and for tranche 1 is in Appendix 12. The terms \nof reference of consultants under tranche 1 are summarized in Appendix 13. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n59. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  are  proposed  for  certain  activities  under \neach  tranche.  The  Government  was  informed  that  for  expenditures  incurred  before  tranche \neffectiveness  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  procurement,  consultant  recruitment \nprocedures,  and  other  expenses  must  fully  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  the \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  When  the  tranche  becomes  effective,  up  to  maximum  of \n20%  of  proceeds  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the \nperiod  not  exceeding  12  months  before  signing  of  the  relevant  financing  agreement.  The \nGovernment  may  opt  for  advance  contracting  without  retroactive  financing.  In  that  case,  the \nprocurement procedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award of \ncontract  until  after  the  tranche  becomes  effective.  The  Government  and  the  EAs  have  been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance any of the proposed projects. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n60. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  disbursement  guidelines.  Direct  payment \nprocedures  will  generally  be  used  for  large  civil  works  and  consultancy  services  contracts,  as \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\nwell as turnkey contracts. Commitment procedures may be used for large turnkey contracts, and \nsupply and delivery contracts. \n \n61. \nEAs will independently establish their respective imprest accounts at a bank acceptable \nto  ADB,  with  initial  advances  equivalent  to  the  estimated  eligible  project  expenditures  for  the \nnext  6  months  or  $100,000,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed \narrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures will \nbe used to reimburse eligible expenditures, or to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for \nany individual payment less than $50,000. The flow of fund is shown in Appendix 14. \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n62. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe  Investment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of the EAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Investment  Program.  In  case  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  are  found  under  any  activities  within  the  tranches,  ADB  will  automatically  cancel  the \nMFF and the concerned tranches. This position has been made clear to the Government.  \n \n\n9. \n\nFinancial Accounting and Auditing \n\nThe  EAs  will  independently  (i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  each  of  their  projects \n63. \nunder  the  Investment  Program;  (ii)  have  such  accounts  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with \nappropriate  auditing  standards  applied  by  independent  auditors  whose  qualifications  and \nexperience are acceptable to ADB; (iii) furnish certified copies of such audited project accounts, \naudited financial statements, and the auditors\u2019 opinion (including the opinions on the use of the \ntranche proceeds) and compliance with the financial covenants of the tranche agreement; and \n(iv)  provide  such  other  information  concerning  the  audit  requested.  The  independent  auditors \nwill be engaged and financed by the Government or the EAs. \n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance and Monitoring \n\n64. \nThe PMO will establish a project performance monitoring team. This will set up base case \nvariables for the Investment Program (in line with the DMF and problem tree analysis), collect data \nfor  performance  monitoring,  process  it  and  submit  it  to  the  PMO  director  and  ADB.  The  key \nindicators and assumptions are in the DMF. Some of these may need to be changed or modified \nover time, and new ones added. The variables deal with impact, outcomes, and outputs. The ADB \ntransaction  and  implementation  teams  will  prepare  periodic  reports  on  overall  progress.  This \ninformation  will  be  shared  with  the  Board.  A  Board  information  paper  will  also  be  submitted \nannually as part of the MFF operations. Further, the Board will be informed on all PFRs, including \ninformation on safeguard assessments and plans. Any major mishap at the level of the Investment \nProgram or individual tranches (with respect to ADB policies and procedures, or with undertakings \nand covenants under the FFA and the tranche agreements) will be reported to the Board. These \nwill also trigger the suspension or cancellation of the MFF and its tranches.  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\ninstitutional  effectiveness, \n\n65. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  2  months  after  signing  of  the  financing \nagreement  for  tranche  1.  The  mission  will  refine  the  implementation  plan  and  facility \nadministration manual. The Government will cause the EAs, though the PMO director, to submit \nto  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  within  2  weeks  of  the  end  of  that  quarter,  and  semiannual \nperformance and monitoring reports. ADB will review quarterly and semiannually reports during \nits  program  annual  reviews.  Regular  reviews  will  be  carried  out  after  tranche  effectiveness.  A \nmidterm  review  will  be  undertaken  within  4  years  after  signing  of  the  FFA.  It  will  focus  on  the \nengineering, \nresults,  environmental  and  social  safeguards, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and compliance with the undertakings set out in the FFA. The \nreview will allow for any necessary corrections. The EAs will submit a project completion report \nwithin 3 months of the completion of each project. \n \n66. \nADB  staff  in  headquarters  and  Afghanistan  Resident  Mission  will  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  on  a  joint  venture  basis  and  as  a  team.  Additional \nstaff  is  being  deployed  to  Kabul  to  work  on  each  of  the  priority  sector  Investment  Programs: \nenergy,  transport,  and  irrigation.  The  team  will  review  the  Investment  Program  regularly.  An \nannual  report  on  the  Investment  Program  will  be  produced.  This  will  cover  issues  related  to \neach  of  the  components  and  will  report  on  inputs  and  outputs,  and  will  start  generating \ninformation  for  outcome  and  impact  indicators  in  the  DMF.  All  compliance  matters  will  be \ncovered under the review, including warranties and representations, covenants, and adherence \nto  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  Any  changes  to  the  tranches  will  be  captured  through  these \nreports.  These  tranches  have  tentative  investment  and  financing  plans,  which  will  be  updated \nand included in the annual MFF report or on other reports due under the review process. The \nproject  performance  report  will  be  updated  every  month  and  reported  to  the  front  office  of  the \nCentral  and  West  Asia  Department.  The  front  office  will  call  for  corrective  actions  as \nappropriate.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n67. \nThe  intention  of  the  MFF  is  that  the  investments  will  benefit  people  and  businesses, \nthereby  contributing  to  economic  growth  and  prosperity.  Energy  security  is  a  huge  problem  in \nAfghanistan. The main benefits accruing from the investment are tangible; others are not. Some \nare physical; others are institutional in nature. Some will be more immediate, while others will be \nlong term. Benefits under subsequent tranches will be reported under each PFR and reported \nannually in the summary MFF report. \n \nA. \n \nFinancial.  A  financial  analysis  for  the  tranche  1  project  has  been  carried  out  in \n68. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  All  financial \ncosts  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  in  2008  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine  the \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return\u2014capital  investment,  operations  and  maintenance,  insurance \ncosts, and taxes\u2014reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The current tariffs with \nan assumed escalation factor were used to estimate the revenue, while incremental operation \nand maintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  13.5%  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated \n69. \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.20%, indicating financial viability for the project. Financial \nviability was gauged by comparing incremental costs and benefits of \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nproject\u201d  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  increased  evacuation  of  power. \nNon-quantifiable financial benefits, such as the quality of power supply, were not included in the \nfinancial evaluation. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 15.  \n \nEconomic.  The  proposed  investments  are  least-cost.  They  are  part  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \n70. \nintegrated  generation  and  transmission  expansion.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a \n\u201ctime-slice\u201d approach to the transmission and distribution system development plan. Economic \nperformance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  \u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenarios.  As \nindividual  projects  are  not  stand-alone,  they  would  not  yield  all  their  benefits  if  considered  in \nisolation.  The  Investment  Program  will  ease  chronic  supply  shortages  and  help  demand  for \nelectric  power.  The  main  benefits  stem  from  (i)  removing  bottlenecks  to  efficient  supply  of \nelectricity to meet the growing energy needs; (ii) improving efficiency, reliability, and emergency \nsecurity;  (iii)  evacuating  power  from  neighboring  countries\u2019  and  new  plants;  and  (iv)  reducing \nresidential  and  commercial  losses.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  tranche  1  project  is \n21.4%,  (based  on  the  incremental  cost\u2013benefit  streams  associated  with  the  Investment \nProgram). A summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 16.  \n \nB. \n \n71. \nSocial and poverty assessments have been carried out. For several projects, samples \nof  up  to  21  districts  in  four  regions  were  taken.  These  surveys  established  that,  although  the \nmain use of electricity is for household lighting, people are willing to invest in other appliances, \nand improve living conditions and livelihoods. The Investment Program covers rural and non-\nrural areas, and benefits poor people, especially those in remote rural areas not connected to \nthe  grid.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  make  a  major  difference  to  people  in  cities.  The \nPMO will refine the final poverty and social analysis for each tranche, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis. 12  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 17. External monitors to be engaged by the EAs will closely monitor the \nimplementation of this strategy. \n \nC. \n \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  Investment  Program  is  divided  into  four \n72. \ntranches, each involving different types of projects and contract modalities. LAR requirements for \nprojects under tranches 2\u20134 cannot be confirmed at this stage, but available information suggests \nthat the impacts will be similar to those in tranche 1. A LAR framework was prepared in detail for \ntranche  1  investments,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and \nOperations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. LAR plans for the projects under subsequent \ntranches  will  be  finalized  once  additional  due  diligence,  and  in  relevant  cases  design  work,  is \ncompleted. The LAR framework is summarized in Appendix 18. \n  \n73. \nTranche 1 projects has been categorized as Category B. Three projects in tranche 1 that \nmay  involve  low-intensity  LAR  are  (i)  NEPS  220  kV  Transmission  Line:  Kunduz\u2013Taloqan;  (ii) \nBaharak  Small  Hydropower  Plant  and  Mini-Grid;  and  (iii)  Development  of  Small  Hydropower \nPlants  in  Badakhshan  and  Bamyan  Provinces  (cofinanced  by  JFPR).  LAR  plans  for  projects \nunder  (i)  and  (ii)  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \nand the Operations Manual, and were guided by the handbook on involuntary settlement for the \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2001.  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis.  Manila.  This  has  been  superseded  by  (i)  ADB.  2007. \nHandbook on Social Analysis, A Working Document. Manila; and (ii) ADB. 2006. Poverty Handbook: Analysis and \nProcesses to Support ADB Operations, A Working Document. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nfirst and second projects. Since the specific sites (up to four) for the project under (iii) are to be \nidentified  during  implementation,  LAR  plans  will  be  prepared  for  subprojects  involving  LAR, \napproved by ADB, and implemented before civil works contractors are mobilized in accordance \nwith  the  LAR  framework.  Other  projects  in  tranche  1  with  physical  investments  do  not  involve \nLAR:  (i)  NEPS  Distribution  Network  \u2013  Kunduz;  (ii)  NEPS  Distribution  Network  \u2013  Baghlan;  and \n(iii) Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation.  \n \n74. \nLAR  for  subsequent  tranche  projects  will  be  categorized  through  the  involuntary \nresettlement categorization form. LAR plans will be prepared in accordance with the Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  and  the  Operations  Manual,  and  guided  by  the  involuntary  resettlement \nhandbook for projects categorized as Category A and B, and will be attached to the PFR. \n \nThe  PMO  and  contractors  will  update  LAR  plans  for  projects  with  turnkey  contracts \n75. \nduring  the  detailed  design  stage.  For  projects  adopting  the  conventional  design-bid-build \nmodality, the implementation consultants will update them during the preconstruction phase. For \nturnkey  projects,  the  contractor  will  not  be  able  to  start  construction  until  the  LAR  plan  is  fully \nimplemented.  For  design-bid-build  projects,  a  civil  works  contractor  will  not  be  mobilized  until \nthe LAR plan is fully implemented. The PMO will monitor the LAR plans and report to ADB. An \nexternal  monitor  will  be  responsible  for  issuing  a  no-objection  certificate  for  the  start  of  civil \nworks. The external monitor will also prepare safeguard compliance reports twice a year. \n \n76. \nIndigenous  Peoples.  The  tranche  1  project  has  been  classified  as  Category  C.  Most \nfuture tranche projects are expected to be the same in terms of indigenous peoples impact. The \nproject areas are inhabited by different ethnic groups. The socioeconomic features and level of \nvulnerability  of  these  people  do  not  fit  the  traits  on  which  the  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  indigenous \npeople is based. Indigenous peoples impact of subsequent tranche projects will be categorized \nthrough  the  indigenous  peoples  impact  categorization  form.  Indigenous  peoples  development \nplan  and  indigenous  peoples  development  frameworks  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) for the projects categorized as Category A. Specific \naction  favorable  to  indigenous  people  will  be  included  in  the  PFR  for  tranche  projects \ncategorized  as  Category  B.  Related  plans  such  as  the  gender  plan  or  the  community \nparticipation plan will be attached to the PFR.  \n \n77. \nLabor  Standards.  DABS  and  MOM  will  ensure  that  all  contractors  (i)  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws; (ii) comply with ADB\u2019s Core Labor Standards;13 (iii) use their best efforts \nto  employ  women  and  local  people  negatively  affected  by,  or  living  in  the  vicinity  of,  the \nprojects; (iv) disseminate information at worksites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases \nand  HIV/AIDS  for  those  employed  during  construction;  (v)  are  required  not  to  differentiate \nbetween men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages or benefits for work of equal value; and (vi) abstain from \nusing child labor. Contractors will ensure that the safety of workers will be in accordance with \nbest  international  practices.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  labor \npractices to the Government and ADB.  \n \nD. \n \n78. \nThe majority of projects under the Investment Program are expected to be classified as \ncategory  B.  However,  some  projects  could  be  classified  differently.  If  that  occurs,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policies  and  procedures  will  apply.  Tranches  2\u20134  projects  require  further  due \ndiligence.  The  current  project  list  is  fairly  firm,  but  some  changes  could  take  place  over  the \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2006. Core Labor Standards Handbook. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\nInvestment  Program  period.  Tranche  1  project  has  been  subjected  to  detailed  due  diligence, \nand  has  been  classified  as  Category  B  in  terms  of  environmental  impact.  Tranche  1  projects \ninvolving  physical  investment  are:  (i)  NEPS  220  kV  Transmission  Line:  Kunduz\u2013Taloqan;  (ii) \nNEPS  Distribution  Network:  Kunduz;  (iii)  NEPS  Distribution  Network:  Baghlan;  (iv)  Baharak \nSmall  Hydropower  Plant  and  Mini-Grid;  (v)  Development  of  Mini  Hydropower  Plants  in \nBadakhshan  and  Bamyan  Provinces  (cofinanced  by  JFPR);  and  (vi)  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields \nRehabilitation.  IEE  reports  for  all  projects  except  for  the  JFPR-cofinanced  project  have  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Because  the  final  sites  (up  to \nfour) for the JFPR cofinance projects are to be formalized, IEEs will be prepared and approved \nby  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  EARF  for  these  projects  before  the  mobilization  of  civil  works \ncontractors.  \n \nThe contractors will update IEEs for projects with turnkey contracts during detailed design \n79. \nstage.  For  the  projects  adopting  design-bid-build  modality,  the  PMO  will  update  them  during  the \npreconstruction phase. For turnkey projects, the contractor will not be able to start construction until \nthe  IEE  is  approved  by  ADB.  For  design-bid-build  projects,  civil  works  contractors  will  not  be \nmobilized  until  the  IEE  is  approved  by  ADB.  The  implementation  consultants  are  responsible  for \nmonitoring the implementation of the environmental monitoring and management plan attached to \nthe IEEs, and to report to the PMO. An external monitor will be engaged to perform environmental \naudits twice a year and prepare safeguard compliance reports. \n \n80. \nEnvironmental impacts under all subsequent tranche projects will be categorized through \nthe  environmental  categorization  form  and  supported  by  rapid  environmental  assessments. \nEnvironmental impact examination reports will be prepared in accordance with the Environment \nPolicy  for  projects  categorized  as  Category  A  and  B  (sensitive).  In  accordance  with  the  same \npolicy,  IEE  reports  will  be  prepared  for  projects  categorized  as  Category  B.  These \nenvironmental safeguard documents will be attached to the PFR. \n \nE. \n \n81. \nAssumptions. The Investment Program is based on the following key assumptions: (i) \nsuccessful  and  timely  implementation  of  energy  sector  projects;  (ii)  institutional  capacity, \nincluding efficiency improvements in DABS; and (iii) continued strengthening of sector reforms, \nbetter regulation, institutional change, and a sound tariff regime. The transaction team has taken \ninto account the experiences of earlier projects. The implementation arrangements put in place \nmitigate  many  of  the  issues  prevalent  in  the  current  portfolio.  The  establishment  of  the  PMO \n(properly managed and funded, independent and with a clear mandate) assumes a tightening of \nproject performance and quality at entry for new investments under all tranches.  \n \n82. \nRisks.  The  key  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  (i)  delayed  restructuring  of \nDABS operations, (ii) insufficient power imports from neighboring countries, (iii) reversal of the \npolicy directions, (iv) inadequate project management, and (v) continued security risk. \n \n83. \nThe  restructuring  of  DABS  is  on  course,  although  the  process  will  need  continued \npolitical  commitment  and  expertise,  and  working  capital  financing  in  the  short  term. \nConsiderable technical assistance is being assigned to this task, including from ADB and other \nagencies  such  as  the  World  Bank.  The  development  of  alternative  power  interconnection \ninfrastructure  is  being  supported  by  an  ongoing  ADB  loan,  while  the  conclusion  of  a  PPA  is \nbeing facilitated. \n84. \nElectricity supplies from Uzbekistan are not confirmed, although considerable progress was \nmade on this in 2008. Supplies from Tajikistan will come on stream in about 18 months, but only \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nbetween May and August. Electricity supplies from Turkmenistan are not yet formalized, and the \ngas  project  (to  supply  Pakistan  and  India)  is  only  on  the  drawing  board.  The  Central  Asia-South \nAsia  Regional  Electricity  Market  Project  is  still  in  the  planning  stage  and  will  take  time  before \nsupplies reach Afghanistan. As such, Afghanistan urgently needs to have its own energy strategy \nand investments. Kabul receives only 2\u20133 hours of electricity a day. \n \n85. \nThe  reversal  of  policy  directions  is  unlikely  but  always  possible.  Afghanistan  needs  to \ndevelop  energy  supplies  urgently.  Only  by  following  best  practices,  including  a  constructive \npolicy  framework,  will  Afghanistan  be  able  to  attract  international  financing.  The  policy  needs \nrefinements, but it is unlikely to be reversed. The MFF includes this as a condition. \n \n86. \nProject  management  has  been  a  problem.  Capacity  is  lacking,  and  the  systems  and \nprocedures are inefficient and slow. The establishment of the PMO is an attempt to break with \npast practices, taking a holistic view of the management of project tasks, themes, and reporting. \nSecurity is likely to remain the most difficult problem in the short to medium term. The situation \nseems to be deteriorating  and this will make it difficult to attract investors and contractors, and \nto  implement  projects.  The  MFF  calls  for  the  establishment  of  community-based,  small-scale \ninvestments  and  contingency  finance  to  deliver  basic  services  in  program  areas.  This  will  not \naddress the core cause of the problem, but it might reduce the risk to program contractors.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Undertakings \n\nA. \n \nThe  Government  and  the  EAs  have  agreed  to  the  following  specific  undertakings,  in \n87. \naddition  to  the  standard  undertakings  agreed  to  in  the  FFA,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents.  \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  about  its  policies  and \n88. \nprojects  related  to  the  energy  sector  that  will  materially  affect  the  financial  viability  of  each \nproject under the Investment Program, and in particular the power generation and transmission \npolicies, laws, and regulations. \n \n89. \nRestructuring.  A  separate  business  unit  other  than  DABS  (TransCo)  will  own  and \noperate  high-voltage  (110kV  and  above)  power  transmission  assets  and  related  switchyards \nand substations by January 2013. A regulatory performance-based contract for TransCo will be \ndeveloped and approved by MEW within 3 years. \n \n90. \nTariff.  The  tariff  formulated  for  TransCo  will  be  adequate  to  cover  its  operating  costs, \nmaintenance, depreciation, and financing cost, and to allow an acceptable return on the equity \nof DABS. Afghanistan will ensure that such tariff is effective by January 2013. The Government \nwill ensure that DABS and TransCo have adequate legal powers and enforcement mechanisms \nto  effectively  collect  service  fees  and  penalize  defaulters  in  order  to  improve  the  collection \nefficiency, deter non-payment and ensure sustainability of DABS and TransCo\u2019s operations. \n \n91. \nInterconnection.  Prior  to  interconnection  of  the  project  assets  financed  under  the  MFF \nwith the Central Asian Power System (CAPS), TransCo will have adopted GOST14 13109-97 (grid \ncode)  as  such  is  applicable  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  high-voltage  power  transmission \nassets  within  CAPS.  No  interconnection  with  power  producers  that  involves  cross-border  power \n\n                                                 \n14 GOST = gosudarstvennyy standart (state standard). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\ntransmission will occur until after a long-term PPA on terms and conditions commercially viable for \nDABS is signed by respective parties. \n \n92. \nProject  Selection  Criteria.  All  projects  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  are  selected  in \naccordance with the agreed criteria set out in the FFA, which adhere to the relevant requirements of \nthe power transmission investment plan and other applicable guidelines for project implementation. \nDABS will monitor the implementation to ensure their successful and timely completion. \n \nCapacity  Development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  key  managerial  positions  on \n93. \nprojects financed under the MFF are competitively selected and remunerated, free and clear of any \nrestrictions applicable to Afghanistan\u2019s public servants. \n \nAuditing  and  Accounting.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  separate  project  accounts  and \n94. \nrecords  are  maintained in a  timely  manner to adequately  identify the use of  tranche  proceeds  in \nsuch a manner and details as may be specified in each financing agreement for relevant tranches. \nAudited financial reports of MFF-financed activities will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of  the \nend of each fiscal year. \n \n95. \nFinancial  Governance.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  its  internal  controls  are  in  accordance \nwith  the  National  Accounting  Standards  and  an  independent  and  autonomous  internal  audit \ndepartment  will  be  set  up  in  DABS.  DABS  financial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards by an external auditor acceptable to \nADB. \n \nEnvironment.  The EAs will ensure that (i) the projects are designed, constructed, and \n96. \noperated  in  accordance  with  national  and  local  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines  and \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (ii)  the  projects  are  designed,  constructed,  and  operated  in \naccordance with the EMPs as reflected in the IEEs and EAR framework; (iii) the environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  work \ncontracts  and  implemented;  and  (iv)  environmental  performance  reports  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  twice  annually  during  the  construction  period,  including  progress  made  on  the  mitigation \nmeasures, monitoring data, problems encountered, enforcement plan, and any violations. \n \n97. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  the  design, \nimplementation and operation of the Investment Program are carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), applicable law and government regulations \nin  Afghanistan,  and  the  agreed  LAR  Framework.  In  the  preparation  and  implementation  of \nprojects or projects to be financed under the MFF the EAs ensure that (i) all land and rights-\nof-way  required  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  traditional  (non-turnkey)  civil \nworks  contractors  are  mobilized  only  at  the  condition  that  LAR  plan  approved  by  ADB  is \ndisclosed  to  the  affected  people  (AP)  and  implemented;  (iii)  for  all  projects,  independently \nfrom contract type, civil works will start only after ADB provides no objection and the relevant \nLAR  plans  are  prepared,  approved  by  ADB,  disclosed  to  the  APs  and  implemented;  (iv) \ncontractors\u2019  activities  are  in  compliance  with  requirements  of  the  LAR  plans;  and  (v)  an \nindependent  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  is  engaged  to  carry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation \nand report to ADB based on the requirements of the LAR plans. \n \n98. \nExecution  of  Civil  Works  Contracts. The EAs will ensure that, subsequent to award of \ncivil works contract under any project, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will \nbe  handed  over  to  the  contractor  unless  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  LAR  framework  and  \nplans,  including  the  timely  delivery  of  compensation  to  APs,  indigenous  peoples  development \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nframework  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  and  the  EARF  and  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plans have been complied with. Any changes to the location, route, \nalignment, or environment impacts on account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject \nto  prior  approval  by  ADB  or  related  agency  in  accordance  with  the  project  selection  criteria  and \nprocedures specified in the FFA. Prior to the commencement of civil works, an accredited demining \nagency must have certified that the relevant construction site(s) has been cleared. \n \n99. \n \n\nSocial Impacts. \n\nGender.  The  EAs  will  follow  the  principles  of  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment  during  the  implementation  of  each  project,  including  taking  all \nnecessary  actions  to  encourage  women  living  in  the  project  area  to  participate  in \nplanning  and  implementing  project  activities.  The  EAs  will  monitor  the  project \neffects  on  women  through,  where  relevant,  gender-disaggregated  data  collected \npursuant  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  project \nperformance monitoring system. \n\nSexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. With assistance of relevant local \nauthorities, the EAs will cause contractors to distribute information on the risks of \nsexually  transmitted  diseases  to  those  employed  during  the  implementation  of \neach project. \n\n \n(iii)  Women  and  child  labor.  The  EAs  will  ensure  that  (i)  there  is  no  differential \npayment  between  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value,  and  (ii)  civil  works \ncontractors do not employ child labor in construction and maintenance activities in \naccordance with applicable laws and regulations and international conventions. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n100.  Security. The Government will ensure that its armed forces and police provide in project \nareas  protection  required  for  uninterrupted  implementation  of  each  project  financed  under  the \nMFF. In addition, it is required that service and works providers in each project submit security \nplans  and  budgets  that  would  ensure  uninterrupted  implementation  of  their  respective  project \nactivities, and include them as part of the contracts and contract price.  \n \n101.  Corporate  Governance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  person  serving  on  the \nboard of DABS, TransCo, an electricity distribution company, or a power generation company is \nconcurrently a board member of any other entity. \n \nB. \n \n\nConditions for Tranche Effectiveness \n\n1. \n\nConditions for the First Tranche \n\n102.  A  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  Government  and  DABS  is  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, has been duly executed and become effective. \n \n\n2. \n\nConditions for the Subsequent Tranches \n\n103.  Tariff.  DABS  has  submitted  petitions  for  tariff  revisions,  as  required,  to  maintain  their \nfinancial viability. Following a tariff determination by MEW or the regulation authority in place, the \nGovernment  will  notify  such  tariff  determination  in  a  prompt  manner  through  the  official  gazette. \nThe Government will ensure that the tariffs determined allow for adequately cover their operating \ncosts, maintenance, depreciation, and financing, and allow an acceptable return on equity. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n104. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  provision  of  grants  and/or  loans  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an \naggregate  principal amount  not  exceeding $570,000,000  equivalent  to the  Islamic \nRepublic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Energy  Sector  Development  Investment  Program \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  on  such  terms  and  conditions  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with then applicable policies relating to allocation of and \neligibility for such resources, and as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  not  exceeding  $12,000,000  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic of Afghanistan for Development of Mini-Hydropower Plants in Badakhshan \nand Bamyan Provinces to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \n\n7 November 2008 \n \n\nC.

contains  an  implicit  prioritization  of  energy  subsector \n1. \nactivities.  Electricity  is  prioritized  over  other  sectors.  The  strategy  is  based  on  a  four-prong \napproach: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nGreater efficiency from existing operations. It is easier, faster, and cheaper to \ngain  a  megawatt  of  power  from  increasing  efficiency  than  from  building  a  new \ngeneration  plant.  Moreover,  addressing  end-use  efficiency  now  reduces  overall \ncosts. For every $5 the Government spends in providing compact florescent light \nbulbs, it saves $51 and 49 watts. \nImprovement in sector governance and coordination, and the promotion of \npublic\u2013private  partnerships. The success of the energy sector will depend on \nenergy utilities operating independently and mobilizing private sector investment. \nA multisector regulator would be a good start. The aim is to pursue outsourcing,  \npreparing  an  enabling  legal,  policy,  and  regulatory  base  for  business,  and  the \ncommercialization  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  In  addition,  coordination \namong the entities and aid agencies must be strengthened. To accomplish this, \ncapacity must be improved. \nRural  energy.  Most  rural  areas  lack  electricity.  This  affects  most  of  the \npopulation. \nInvestments  in  new  capacity.  Progress  in  creating  new  supplies  has  been \ninsufficient. The Government wants to increase production from various sources, \nincluding  hydro,  gas,  and  coal.  New  supplies  must  be  rationalized,  and  efforts \nmust be focused on a few large projects, such as the North East Power System \n(NEPS). \n\n \n2. \nIn  addition  to  addressing  immediate  and  short-term  needs,  the  country  also  needs  to \nconsider longer-term issues. Because Afghanistan is building its energy infrastructure from the \nground up, it can learn from the lessons in other countries. It can prioritize energy efficiency and \nrenewable  energy.  While  the  national  grid  is  important  in  transporting  power  from  cheaper \nmarkets,  decentralized  power  will  prove  more  beneficial  in  the  long  run.  By  locating  power \ngeneration closer to users, losses can be significantly reduced.  \n\n \nActions Under the Strategy \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nIncreased Efficiency from Existing Operation. \n\n \nA  key  objective  of  the  strategy  is  to  add  850,000  residential  and  nonresidential \n3. \nconnections  by  2010.  This  will  increase  access  from  27%  to  65%  of  total  population  in  urban \nareas and from 6% to almost 25% nationally. By 2015, the goal is to increase urban access to \n90% and overall national access to 33%. This work will require the rehabilitation of the system, \nincluding substations and transformers, and distribution networks. \n \n4. \nthermal  plants,  require \nimmediate reconstruction. Small diesel generating sets need to be purchased to supplement he \npower supply in selected urban areas, and micro hydro and other energy resources need to be \ndeveloped  in  rural  areas.  Through  these  combined  efforts,  the  supply  of  electricity  throughout \nthe country should increase by 66%. \n\nincluding  hydropower  and \n\nExisting  generation \n\nfacilities, \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\n \n5. \nTechnical  Operations.  The  electricity  system  is  technically  deficient.  Investments  are \nneeded  in  the  dispatch  system,  the  controls,  reactive  power,  and  technical  codes  need \nimprovement. \n \n6. \nEnergy Efficiency. The use of efficient lighting, installation of motion detectors, the use \nof better light bulbs, and greater public awareness are some areas for efficiency improvements.  \n \nRegional  Energy.  In  the  short  term,  maximizing  the  use  and  performance  of  existing \n7. \nassets  includes  increasing  the  domestic  load  to  support  cross-border  power  deals.  This  will \nimprove energy security while working on domestic supplies. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Governance, Coordination, and Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\na. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nCommercialization.  One  of  the  most  important  activities  is  to  transform  SOEs  into \n8. \ncorporate  entities  operating  under  commercial  principles  independent  from  the  overseeing \nministries,  while  changing  the  ministries\u2019  mandate  from  operating  utilities  into  regulators  and \nfacilitators. \n \n9. \nAfghanistan  Electricity  Organization  (DABM)  is  undergoing  such  a  transformation.  An \naudit of DABM assets, liabilities, and employees has been conducted. Liquidation of DABM is \nexpected to be completed by March 2009. On 17 March 2008, the Cabinet approved the articles \nof  incorporation  for  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS),  which  will  convert  it  into  a \nGovernment-owned commercial company that will operate under the Commercial Code. Viable \nassets and technically qualified employees of DABM will be transferred to DABS by the end of \n2008.  \n \n10. \nThe  strategy  to  commercialize  power  operations  includes  the  following:  (i)  a  new \norganization at DABS, including a board of directors and senior management group comprising \na chief executive and financial, operational, and commercial officers; (ii) consolidation of the 19 \ncorporate offices into eight \u201dhubs,\u201d which will be converted into profit centers; (iii) installation of \nmetering, billing, and collection systems; management information systems; and accounting and \nprocurement systems; (iv) regularized internal and independent external audit functions; and (v) \nestablishment of new departments including legal, customer service, and loss reduction. \n \n11. \nDivestments.  The  Government  has  designed  a  divestment  strategy  calling  for  the \nliquidation, restructuring, corporatization, and/or privatization of other energy assets under state \ncontrol. This process will start in 2009. \n \n12. \nThe Water and Power Engineering Authority and the Power Construction Unit have been \napproached by private investors. Bringing the Power Construction Unit operations under DABS \nis being considered. \n \n13. \nNorthern  and  Sabzak  coal  enterprises  have  been  leased  through  management \ncontracts. A review is under way to determine how these and other hydrocarbon assets may be \noperated better in the future. \n \n14. \nGovernance.  The  complexity  of  the  institutional  framework  contributes  to  difficulties  in \ndeveloping an effective strategy for the sector, and implementing and monitoring rehabilitation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nworks and reforms. Functions within ministries need to be combined and streamlined, with the \ngoal of reducing the Government\u2019s direct involvement in the sector.  \n \n15. \nFinancial Discipline. Market-based operations are new to Afghan energy managers. As \npart of the strategy, the Government will seek support from its development partners to improve \nfinancial  management.  This  requires  designing  and  preparing  an  integrated  annual  energy \nbudget based on Government support that is in line with the strategic priorities. In addition, new \nprotocols  for  budget  management  and  oversight  need  to  be  put  in  place  in  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and the energy ministries.1 The Government will build near-term capacity in accounting, \nproject finance, audit, and fiscal performance.  \n \n16. \nLegal  and  Regulatory  Frameworks.  The  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  are  weak \nand need strengthening. Despite the approval of the Minerals Law in 2005, the legal foundation \nis  inadequate  to  support  legitimate  private  investment,  protect  consumers,  and  ensure \ntransparent  spending.  The  Government  needs  support  in  this  area.  Some  regulatory  work  is \nunder  way,  but  progress  has  been  slow  and  uncoordinated.  This  matter  requires  a  more \nsystematic approach to longer-term sector reform. \n \n17. \n \n\nCapacity. Capacity development initially should focus on four areas: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTechnical.  Antiquated  systems  require  modernization.  Greater  capacity  is \nneeded  to  operate  new  high-voltage  transmission  lines,  and  to  explore  oil  and \ngas fields. Renewable and coal technologies that ensure safe, clean operations \nare  required.  Health  and  safety  have  received  little  attention,  and  enforcement \nand inspection are weak. \nCommercial.  Institutions  need  to  be  made  more  commercially  oriented,  and  to \nintroduce cost-recovery actions at the level of the institutions. \nLegal  and  regulatory.  The  courts,  local  energy  enterprises,  and  the  energy \nministries,  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Ministry  of  Finance  need  training  on \ncommercial matters. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nCoordination \n\nCoordination  is  lacking  at  two  levels:  (i)  within  the  Government,  and  (ii)  between  the \n\n \n18. \nGovernment and the development partners. The strategy calls for improvements in both areas. \n \nConsolidation of Government Energy Functions. Energy functions are spread across \n19. \nfive ministries, with inputs from three other ministries as well as various national programs. This \nmakes coordinating energy strategy difficult. A strategic move would be to establish one Ministry \nof Energy. \n \n20. \nCoordination  between  the  Government  and  Development  Partners.  The  Inter-\nMinisterial  Commission  for  Energy  (ICE)  was  established  in  2006  as  the  coordinating  and \npolicy-making body for energy activities. Chaired by the Ministry of Economy, ICE includes the \nministries  of  Energy  and  Water,  Finance,  and  Mines  as  core  members.  ICE  was  designed  to \nhelp  the  Government  understand  and  monitor  energy  development  based  on  commercial \nprinciples. It oversees energy sector policy and infrastructure investments, and coordinates with \ndevelopment partners. ICE brings together a wide array of interests from the Government and \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water,  Ministry  of  Mines,  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development,  Ministry  of  Commerce  and \n\nIndustries, Ministry of Urban Planning, and Ministry of Agriculture. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\nits development partners. It is not responsible for project implementation, but it develops policy \nin  line  with  fiscal  and  investment  strategies.  It  also  assists  the  Government  with  agreements \nwith the private sector. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nPrivatization \n\n \n21. \nPrivate  Sector  in  the  Afghan  Energy  Sector.  The  Government  has  paid  limited \nattention  to  the  role  of  private  investment.  While  the  commercialization  of  the  state  power \ncompany (DABM) has started, the restructuring does not include the 66 DABM operations within \nthe 19 regional DABM offices. \n \n22. \nIndependent  Power  Production.  While  there  is  ample  evidence  of  small  diesel  and \nhydropower  generation  throughout  the  country,  large  viable  independent  or  private  power \nprojects  have  not  been  restructured.  The  Government  has  not  explored  build-own-operate, \nbuild- operate-transfer, or other traditional power sector models. \n \nOutsourcing.  Outsourcing  of  power  sector  functions  to  the  private  sector  has  been \n23. \nslow.  Services  including  operations  and  maintenance,  spare  parts  supply,  fuel  procurement, \nbilling and accounting, and technical management could be contracted out. \n \nConcessions.  In  the  absence  of  the  final  hydrocarbons  law  and  regulations,  the \n24. \nGovernment  supports  contracting  through  concessions.  Mobilizing  these  types  of  contracts \nthrough  transparent  tender  processes  will  be  emphasized  more  in  the  coming  years.  This \napproach is needed to deal with oil, natural gas, and coal resources. \n \n\n3. \n\nRural Energy \n\n \n25. \nRural energy development is an integral part of the strategy. The approach is to develop \noff-grid and on-grid generation capacity, and to link this to consumers through new investments \nin transmission. \n \n\n4. \n\nInvestment in New Capacity  \n\nGeneration.  The  domestic  generation  agenda  included  developing  hydropower  and \n\n \n26. \nthermal power, including gas and coal. \n \nTransmission.  The  country  needs  at  least  three  new  high-voltage  power  transmission \n27. \nlines  to  evacuate  imported  power  and  to  encourage  domestic  production.  Many  parts  of  the \ncountry lack coverage. \n \nDistribution.  The  priority  is  to  improve  the  system  in  Kabul.  This  includes  technical \n28. \nrehabilitation  of  existing  power  lines,  development  of  loss-reduction  programs,  installation  of \ntechnically sound meters, meter reading protocols, and better billing and collection.  \n \nExpansion and Synchronization of the Grid. Isolated grids need to become integrated \n29. \ninto  the  national  grid.  With  the  importation  of  more  power  supplies,  the  synchronization  of  the \nAfghan grid with its northern neighbors\u2019 grids is vital. This will require investments. \n \nSmall-Scale Power. About 80% of the Afghan people live in rural and remote locations. \n30. \nThe  National  Solidarity  Program  (NSP),  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDevelopment  (MRRD),  is  supporting  more  use  of  micro  hydropower,  solar,  and  wind  energy, \nwhere possible. The Government is committed to commercializing these activities. \n \n31. \nfeasibility studies have been conducted. These need to be updated.  \n \n\nAssessments on New Energy Sources and Uses. Since 2003, several project-based \n\n5. \n\nImplementation  \n\n \n32. \nmedium-term investment plan totals $4.2 billion.  \n \n\nTo  achieve  the  objectives  and  strategic  priorities  set  forth

The project is a 200-kilometer, double-circuit transmission line \nfrom Pul-e-Khumri to Chimtala (Kabul). The NEPS system already has a transmission line along \nthis  corridor.  However,  as  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS)  is  planning  to  import \nelectricity  from  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan,  and  expand  the  NEPS  system  to  south  of  Kabul, \ncapacity constraints along this corridor will become a bottleneck. Therefore, before any physical \nexpansion of NEPS to the south of Kabul, the capacity of this section needs to be augmented. \n\n \n\nTranche 3 Projects \n\nDABS Institutional Capacity Development ($10 million). This project will assist DABS \n2. \nprimarily with capacity building for their management information system, a metering program, \nintroduction or upgrading of the billing system, and implementing efficiencies in their collection \nsystem. \n \n3. \nProject  Management  and  Due  Diligence\u2014Consulting  Services  ($5  million).

Grant Development Objectives and Expected Key Performance Indicators \n\nGrant  Development  Objectives:  The  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  rural \ncommunities  in  Badakhshan  and  Bamyan  provinces  through  the  provision  of  electricity  services \nsupplied by mini hydropower plants (MHP) with generating capacity below 1,000 kilowatts (kW). \n\nThe Project outcome will include: (i) provision of affordable and stable electricity, (ii) increase in rural \ncommercial  activities  from  establishment  of  enterprises  using  electricity,  (iii)  increased  employment \nopportunities, (iv) reduction of indoor pollution caused by the use of indigenous sources of energy, and \n(v) capacity building in small hydropower development. \n\nThe Project outputs are the identification, planning, designing, and establishment of a maximum of four \noff-grid MHPs, each with an installed capacity in the order of magnitude of 500 kW. Target areas are \ndistrict centers that are not planned for grid connection in the foreseeable future or are being supplied \nthrough  expensive  and  unreliable  diesel  generation.  Communities  will  receive  support  to  establish \nincome-generating activities during the day-time (i.e., off-peak hours). \n\nThe  MHPs  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS),  the \nnational  power  utility.  To  ensure  sustainable  management,  capacity  building  is  integrated  as  an \nessential  component  of  the  Project.  Similarly,  the  entire  project  cycle  is  regarded  as  an  on-the-job \ntraining opportunity in which counterpart staff of the Executing Agency, DABS, will be closely engaged \nin subproject preparation and implementation.  \n\nExpected Key Performance Indicators (maximum 5 indicators): \n1. \n\nA maximum of four MHPs, each with installed capacity of around 500 kW totaling up to 2.0 MW \ncommissioned \nCheap and reliable electricity supplied to up to 5,000 households (400 watts[W]/household) \nSmall enterprises propagated in the supply area \nCapacity  building  of  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  and  DABS  staff  in  the \nimplementation and operation of MHPs  \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nIII.

However,  DABS \ndoes  not  have  any  experience  with  the  operation  of  a  220  kV  transmission  system,  or \ncontemporary protection and communication systems. Hence, DABS is seeking one contractor to \nmanage,  operate,  and  maintain  the  NEPS  220  kV  system  for  up  to  3  years,  with  two  1-year \noptions  for  providing  continued  assistance  to  DABS  to  operate  and  maintain  the  expanding \nsystem. This consulting service will emphasize training of DABS staff to take over the O&M of the \nsystem  in  a  phased  manner  over  3  years.  The  consultant  will  also  be  responsible  for  assisting \nDABS  with  the  procurement  of  (i)  spare  parts,  (ii)  equipment,  (iii)  tools,  and  (iv)  emergency \nrestoration  system,  which  are  to  be  financed  by  a  separate  procurement  package  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n9. \nAbout  200  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The \nanticipated  positions  include  (i)  project  manager,  (ii)  transmission  line  manager,  (iii)  substation \nmanager, (iv) procurement specialist, (v) lineman (trainer), (vi) electrician (trainer), and (vii) training \nspecialist. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n67\n\nOther PMO Support \n\nE. \n \n10. \nProject  Management.  Consultants will be engaged to support the day-to-day operations \nof the PMO. Given the limited capacity in DABS, consultants are needed in the following areas: (i) \nsafeguards;  (ii)  technical  work  (design  and  supervision);  (iii)  legal  matters;  (iv)  finance  and \nadministration;  (v)  evaluation  and  monitoring,  reporting,  management  information  systems;  (vi) \ncommunications;  (vii)  due  diligence  for  projects  under  new  tranches;  (viii)  results  measurement; \nand (ix) capacity building and training. About 18 positions will be needed to set up these teams. \nThe  duration  of  these  services  under  tranche  1,  totaling  about  160  person-months,  will  be  24 \nmonths. The advisory mandates include short-term contracts to address more specific tasks. \n \n11. \n \n\nProject Preparation. Tranche 2 of the MFF tentatively comprises the following projects. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Replication of Pul-e-Khumri\u2013Chimtala Project \nNEPS 220 kV: Replication of Chimtala 160 MVA Substation Project \nNEPS 220 kV Transmission Line: Southern Extension Project \nDABS Institutional Capacity Development Project (MIS/Billing/Metering) \n\n \n12. \nA  team  of  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  help  prepare  the  projects.  For  the  three \nprojects  involving  physical  investments,  feasibility  studies  will  be  conducted.

All financial costs and benefits have been expressed at constant 2008 prices. Cost \nstreams used to determine the financial internal rate of return (FIRR)\u2014capital investment, and \noperations and maintenance\u2014reflect the cost of delivering the estimated benefits. The assumed \ntariffs are based on existing tariffs used for the respective projects. \n \nB. \n\nMethodology and Major Assumptions \n\n2. \nThe Investment Program involves several projects. Apart from the Baharak Hydro Power \nPlant project, all of the project\u2019s financial benefits are calculated based on the assumption that \nthe  country\u2019s  220-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  system  will  be  in  operation  and  transmitting \npower by the time the projects are completed.  \n \n3. \nFinancial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of \n\u201cwith  investment\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  investment\u201d  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  from \nincreases  in  power  transmitted  through  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  because \nphysical  constrains  have  been  removed  as  a  result  of  the  investment.  Installing  additional \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  removes  the  bottlenecks  that  prevent  available \ngeneration and import capacity from being transmitted. Incremental operating and maintenance \ncosts have been computed as a percentage of the investment. It is assumed that the investment \nwill have a 30-year economic life; residual value has not been factored in. \n \n4. \nTariffs are not set by a central agency on a regional basis. Tariffs used in this analysis \nare based on the existing tariffs used in the region of the project, and have been adjusted to a \nlevel of self sustainability of the project. The demand function for the adjusted tariffs has been \ncomputed  using  past studies  on  demand  for  electricity  in Afghanistan,  primarily  from  technical \nassistance.2  \n \n5. \nFor  the  operations  and  maintenance  project,  which  does  not  generate  revenue,  no \nbenefits were included and an FIRR analysis was not undertaken. Costs from the projects were \nincluded in the analysis of the overall financial viability of Tranche 1. Detailed information on the \nmethodology and assumptions is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n\nTo  compute  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  it  is  assumed  that  the \n6. \nfinancing  sources  would  consist  of  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS)  equity \ncontribution  financed  through  retained  earnings.  Based  on  Afghanistan\u2019s  long-term  depository \ninterest  rate,  the  cost  of  DABS\u2019s  equity  is  calculated  at  7%  in  nominal  costs.  The  other \nassumptions  are  a  domestic  inflation  rate  of  8%  and  tax  rate  of  3%.  The  WACC  for  the \ninvestment program during 2009\u20132012 is 0.92% (Table A15.1). \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005 Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Government or an independent regulator regulates this sector because \nof its natural monopolistic characteristics\u2014high fixed costs make it unprofitable for a second firm to \nenter and compete. \n \n 2.  \nAll  the  components  are  part  of  the  least-cost  expansion  program  developed  under  the \npower system master plan. The plan considers supply alternatives to areas without grid supply and \nwith  large-scale  isolated  diesel  generation.  The  Investment  Program  is  the  least-cost  option  for \ndeveloping transmission and distribution network in the selected cities. Incrementally, the Project \nprogram  will  greatly  reduce  the  reliance  on  inefficient  and  high-cost  village,  household,  and \nenterprise  self-generation  at  unit  costs  in  the  range  $0.15\u2013$0.55  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  The \nestimated average incremental cost of grid-connected electricity is $0.079 per kWh. \n \nB.  \n \nTo  convert  financial  project  cost  into  economic  cost,  turnover  and  income  taxes  were \n3.  \ndeducted,  and  connection  costs  were  added.  Annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and \nadministration  costs  were  calculated  in  economic  prices  (with  financial  prices  adjusted  using  the \nstandard conversion factor). No price contingencies were included in the base capital cost, but the \neconomic  capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies.  Costs  were  separated  into  foreign \nexchange and local costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was used. The cost of supply was \nvalued based on the long-run marginal cost for generation and transmission as calculated in the \npower sector master plan. \n \n 4.  \nAs  in  the  financial  analysis,  30  years  was  used  for  the  project  economic  analysis. \nInvestment is assumed to take place during 2010\u20132013, and projects benefits are assumed to be \nrealized thereafter. Beyond 2025, further investment will be required to meet incremental demand \ngrowth. \n \n5. \nWith  regards  to  the  O&M  component,  Afghanistan  Electricity  Corporation  (DABS),  the \nstate-owned enterprise responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in \nAfghanistan,  operates  the  110-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  system.  However,  DABS  lacks  the \ntechnical  and  managerial  capacity,  as  well  as  the  experience,  to  operate  and  maintain  the  more \ncomplex 220 kV transmission system, and to coordinate the operations with systems dispatched. A \nnumber  of  options  were  considered.  Contracting  out  O&M  of  the  transmission  system  with  a \ncapacity  building  program  was  identified  as  the  preferred  option,  because  it  enables  the \ntransmission  system  to  become  operational  immediately  after  construction  is  completed.  It  also \nfacilitates  the  transfer  of  technical  and  managerial  expertise.  Further,  it  provides  a  structured \ntraining program (both classroom and hands-on training) to develop the capacity of DABS staff to \noperate  the  transmission  system  after  the  management  contract  has  expired.  A  detailed \nexplanation of the economic analysis of the O&M is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  main  benefits  are  derived  from  (i)  the  eventual  connection  to  northern  neighboring \ncountries for the long-term reliable electricity; (ii) the connection of new customers to electricity; (iii) \n\nQuantification of Benefits \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n73\n\nimproved  availability  and  reliability;  and  (iv)  the  use  of  non-diesel  sources  to  generate  electricity, \nand  loss  reduction.  The  incremental  and  non-incremental  benefits  were  selected  separately. \nIncremental benefits were calculated using customers\u2019 willingness to pay. Non-incremental benefits \nwere not captured in the calculation, as resource cost savings for individual components could not \nbe reliably estimate.  \n  \n7. \nMost households in the project area do not have access to grid electricity. However, village-\nsponsored systems and privately operated generators based on diesel or gas-powered generation \nsets provide limited amounts of electricity. Thus, even in the absence of grid supply, the residential, \nGovernment, and other sectors consume some electricity, although the price paid is substantially \nhigher than for the grid-connected customers. \n \n\n \n1. \n\nDomestic Consumers \n\n \n8. \nFor  the  economic  analysis,  adjustments  were  made  to  incremental  electricity  sales  to \nexclude  non-incremental  energy  consumption,  i.e.,  existing  energy  consumption  that  will  be \ncaptured by Afghanistan Electricity Organization (DABM) as the network is rehabilitated. Based on \nthe  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey,  the  domestic  average  non-incremental  demand  was \nestimated at 9.3 kWh per month per household. For other consumer groups, it was assumed that \nsuppressed demand is met from other electrical and nonelectrical sources. \n \n9. \nThe economic benefits of extending the grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \non the cost of alternative energy sources used for existing consumption levels, as well as on the \nwillingness to pay for induced consumption if a reliable grid supply were available. An analysis of \nthe  socioeconomic  survey  showed  that  that  the  non-incremental  consumption  of  electricity  or  its \nequivalent in other forms of energy is approximately $5.80 per household per month, whether grid-\nconnected or not. Many households with access to electricity are supplied by village-operated gas- \nor  diesel-powered  generation  sets  for  an  average  of  about  5  hours  per  day.  The  average \nexpenditure  per  household  from  this  source  is  $5.12  per  month  for  consumption  of  9.3  kWh, \nequivalent to $0.55 per kWh. \n \n10. \nHouseholds  in  project  areas  connected  to  the  grid  pay  a  tariff  of  $0.02\u2013$0.05  per  kWh. \nThey spend on average $5.86 per month for electricity, consuming 107\u2013281 kWh per household \nper  month.  Thus,  incremental  consumption  of  electricity  within  the  project  areas  in  the  domestic \nsector is 98.5\u2013280 kWh per month per household (total average consumption with the project less \nnon-incremental consumption). Therefore, non-incremental consumption of electricity is valued at \nthe resource cost of $0.55 per kWh. \n \n11. \nIncremental consumption of electricity, valued assuming a linear demand function (i.e., that \n50% of the difference between the current tariff and the cost of the alternative represents consumer \nsurplus),  is  estimated  at  $0.03  per  kWh).  A  semi-log  demand  function,  which  would  theoretically \nlower the value of the incremental consumption, was not used, because the price change would \nnot be significant after rounding to one decimal place in US dollars. \n \nThe analysis ignored any benefit from supply reliability improvements because the level of \n12. \nindustrialization is very low in Afghanistan and, consequently, the difference between the value of \nlost  load  and  tariff  will  be  low.  An  average  incremental  cost  of  future  electricity  supply  was \nestimated as part of the power system master plan to be about $0.09 per kWh for the integrated \ncentral  grid.  Most  customers  in  the  current  and  expanded  network  will  be  connected  at  the  low-\nvoltage  level.  At  current  tariffs,  supply  costs  are  typically  under-recovered,  and  an  economic \nsubsidy to domestic consumers will be realized as the system expands. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n2. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n \n13.  Minor benefits to the O&M component have been identified. However, for the purposes of \ncalculating the EIRR, it is believed that the net economic benefits of the O&M component are the \nforegone benefits of the other projects without implementation of the component. In other words, \nwithout the O&M component, DABS would not be able to operate the 220 kV system leading to the \ntransmission  line  remaining  idle  or  producing  unreliable  and  low-quality  service.  Therefore,  the \ncomponent contributes to the project as an \u201call or nothing\u201d benefit\u2014benefits of the other projects \nwould be gained with the inclusion of the O&M component, but none would be gained without it. As \nsuch,  only  the  costs  of  the  O&M  component  have  been  included  in  the  EIRR  analysis  without \nincluding any specific benefit coming from the O&M component directly. \n \n\n3. \n\nGas Fields Rehabilitation \n\nEconomic Model and Evaluation \n\n \n14. \nAn  additional  benefit  for  the  Sheberghan  Gas  Fields  Rehabilitation  Project\u2014gas \npurchases  by  DABS  for  a  future  gas-fired  power  plant\u2014has  been  factored  in.  The  economic \nbenefit of rehabilitating the gas facilities are revenues from the sale of incremental fuel to DABS. \nProduction is assumed to start in 2015 with 2.8 million gigajoules (GJ) per year sold, increasing \nto more than 10.0 million GJ in 2030. The gas tariff is conservatively set at $6 per GJ throughout \nthe model life. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nTo  test  the  economic  viability  of  each  of  the  components,  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) was calculated based on the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with \neach  project.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  performance  of  the  proposed \ncomponents  by  comparing  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenarios,  i.e.,  the  economic \nvalue of the incremental and non-incremental supply of electricity that the components will provide \ncompared with the existing patterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n16. \nEconomic returns are acceptable for most projects. This stems from the capacity of the grid \nextensions to bring urban-quality power at the urban tariff to rural villages that would otherwise face \nhigh costs for low-quality service. The Baharak hydro power project is 0.5 percentage points below \nthe 12% benchmark because of its large loan (about $30 million) for a relatively small generation \noutput  (2  megawatts)  and  a  small  initial  service  population  (35,000).  The  project  is  considered \nimportant  because  the  service  population  is  isolated.  However,  the  facility  will  allow  poor \nhouseholds on average to consume more than 10 times the electricity that they had access to with \na similar household budget without the project. The Sheberghan Gas Fields Rehabilitation Project \nproduces a relatively high EIRR because all of the purchases will be used to supply a planned gas-\nfired power plant that will supply the national grid with electricity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n75\n\nTable A16.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return for Project Components \n\nProject \n1.

Although  the  primary  focus  has  been  on  lighting  and  heating,  a  longer-term  approach  is  required  if \nelectricity is to contribute to sustained economic growth and support poverty reduction efforts. \n \nMore than 80% of the population lives in rural and remote areas, where off-grid energy supply is supported through \nthe National Solidarity Project (NSP). The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction component will provide support to this \nsector, while the transmission and distribution component will support urban and/or town supply.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nThe  continuing  state  of  conflict  in  Afghanistan  has  resulted  in  deteriorating  systems  for  energy  transmission  and \ndistribution nationally. The rural poor particularly have no access to a reliable supply of energy. \n \nSupporting better efficiency of the sector and improving access are expected to ensure a reliable supply to multiple \nusers.  Providing  a  stable  supply  of  energy  through  support  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  energy \ninfrastructure, including institutional development,  will  help to stimulate the local economy and improve household \nsupply.  \n \nProjects under the Investment Program will focus on rehabilitation and expansion of existing facilities, including off-\ngrid rural electrification beyond the main population centers. Additionally, uninterrupted, 24-hour supply is expected \nfor eastern and northeastern Afghanistan, as well as district centers not yet connected to the grid. \n \nFor the commercial and industrial sectors, which currently use generators or fuelwood, a stable electricity supply is \nconsidered a key stimulus for rehabilitating now-defunct industry and establishing new ones, such as oil refineries, \nsugar mills, and rice mills. Small-scale businesses are likely to expand when connected to the grid.  \n \nThe population in the beneficiary areas is growing, and the standard of living of most households is improving. As \nsuch,  a  healthy  demand  for  electricity  can  be  expected.  Over  time,  the  Investment  Program  is  expected  to \ncontribute to greater productivity in the industrial and small-scale commercial sectors.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe project is expected to directly benefit about 92,000 households, or 1.2 million poor people. The average daily \nper capita income was estimated at $0.39 per day.   \n \nThe population benefiting from the project is urban- or town-based and rural. The primary occupation is farming, followed \nby government employment. Household\u2019s have multiple sources of income, either through the household head or other \nwage-earning family members.  \n \nA stable electricity supply was considered a second priority to clean, potable water by the households surveyed for \nthe  social  assessment.  Electricity  was  perceived  to  be  a  strong  contributor  to  better  learning  opportunities  for \nchildren,  generally  better  livelihoods,  and  wider  access  to  regular  water  supply.  Fewer  health  problems  resulting \nfrom the substitution of kerosene with electricity was perceived to be an important benefit. The study found a strong \nwillingness  to  pay,  but  the  agency  responsible  for  payment  collections  was  weak.  Of  the  1,161  households \nsurveyed, 81.6% responded that the current supply was inadequate for their household needs and 62% were willing \nto  pay  for  a  grid  connection.  The  poorest  households  expended  a  higher  share  of  their  income  on  energy,  with \nkerosene  being  the  most  common  form.  Grid-supplied  electricity  was  found  to  be  the  cheapest  form  of  electricity \nused by poor households.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n77\n\n \nRegular  supply  and  access  is  also  expected  to  provide  support  to  the  Disarmament,  Demobilization  and \nReintegration Program. Ex-combatants who surrender their weapons are retrained and provided with start-up costs \nand supported in forming a business. In addition, the presence of the United Nations, bilateral and nongovernment \norganization  programs  that  also  assist  in  community  development  initiatives,  returning  refugees  and  internally \ndisplaced persons; reintegration and support to women\u2019s participation in civil and economic activities will all benefit \nfrom  improved  supply  and  efficiency.  In  small  towns,  small  businesses,  such  as  shops,  restaurants,  agro-\nprocessing, and home-based businesses, are likely to gain the most.  \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Community  consultation  meetings  were  held  with  the  local  governments,  heads  of  regional  security,  and \ncommunity  representatives  of  Kunduz,  Khanabad,  and  Takhar  cities.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ndiscussed with the local government officials the scope of the projects and ADB\u2019s commitment to the Government, \nand  all  of  them  gave  their  commitment  to  fully  support  the  project  once  started.  All  communities  welcomed  the \nproposed projects. The only concerns raised were the length of time to complete construction. The ADB informed \nthe  communities  about  the  processes  involved,  from  design  to  construction,  and  the  link  to  imported  power  from \nneighboring  countries.  The  head  of  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  in  Kunduz  also  requested  assistance  with  the \ndisposal of old transformers. The Mission established that the line route from Kunduz to Taloqan has been changed \nfrom its previous alignment, which requires a re-estimation of costs. Security issues were discussed, and the region \nis assessed as low risk. \n2.

Was a consultation and participation (C&P) plan prepared? \nA C&P plan will be prepared by implementation consultants of each project and updated by the contractors before \ncivil works start. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \nWhile  women\u2019s  participation  in  public  life,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  is  still  restricted,  the  provision  of  electricity  is \nexpected to benefit their domestic activities. In addition, access to information through television and radio, as well \nas better health and education services in target areas, is expected to benefit women and girls. Equal opportunities \nfor employment and wages will be provided to the local population during construction.  \n2.  Key  Actions.

Afghanistan  Electricity \nCorporation  (DABS)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  Finance  will  be  provided  through  a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) comprising discrete projects to be implemented sequentially \nover 5 years, indicatively under three tranches. The Investment Program includes physical and \nnonphysical  projects.  Projects  in  tranche  1  with  physical  investments  that  may  entail  land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) include (i) a transmission line from Kunduz to Taloqan, and \n(ii)  the  Baharak  Hydropower  development.  Similar  types  of  projects  are  envisaged  for  the \nsubsequent tranches. \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n\nDABS prepared this LAR framework1 to guide the preparation of LAR plans or short LAR \n2. \nplans 2  for  projects  under  the  Investment  Program  in  a  fashion  fitting  the  requirements  of \nAfghanistan  law  and  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  This  LAR  framework \noutlines  provisions,  procedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for  preparing  and  implementing \nLAR plans in projects that require LAR. The program management office (PMO) of DABS, assisted \nby  experts  engaged  through  the  management  and  implementation  consultants,  will  be \nresponsible for conducting the social assessment and preparation of LAR plans as per this LAR \nframework. \n\n3. \n\nLAR- Related Project Implementation Conditions \n\n3. \nThe  initiation  of  the  work  for  each  tranche  will  be  conditioned  on  the  preparation  of  an \ninitial  impact  assessment  identifying  likelihood/  and  nature  of  LAR  impacts,  as  well  as  the  LAR \nplanning capacity needed for the tranche and projects. Based on this initial assessment, the LAR \nframework may have to be modified to address LAR issues specific to the tranche and projects. \nOnce a project design is finished, a due diligence scoping plan subdividing project sections or lots \nbetween  those  with  and  without  LAR  will  be  a  condition  for  initiating  any  civil  work  in  sections \nwhere LAR is not needed. Finally, the preparation and implementation of a LAR plan acceptable \nto ADB will be a condition to initiate civil works in sections or lots where LAR is required. The draft \nLAR  plans  based  on  detailed  designs  and  on  completion  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey \n(DMS).  A full census and inventory of losses will be disclosed in Dari to the affected persons and \naffected  families  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  the  beginning  of  civil \nworks.  Compensation  and  other  assistance  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons  before \nconstruction begins. \n\n                                                 \n1  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) as well as national policy instruments, and laws, \nparticularly  the  provisions  under  Law  on  Land  Acquisition  in  the  Constitution  of  Afghanistan.  The  compensation \npolicy framework and entitlements for this project are formulated with reference to the salient sections of the Law \non Land Acquisition and the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n\n2  Resettlement  is  considered  significant  if  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts  (defined  as  impacts \ninvolving physical displacement and/or or a loss greater than 10% of their income-generating assets. In case of a \nproject with significant impacts, a full LAR plans will be prepared. If impacts are not significant, short LAR plans will \nbe instead required. A short LAR plan covers the same issues as that of a full LAR plan, as relevant, but in less \ndetail. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n \nB. \n\nADB Policy \n\nAffected families should be fully \ninformed and consulted in \nresettlement and compensation \noptions. \nAffected persons should be \ncompensated for all their losses at \nreplacement cost. \n\nLack of formal land title should not be \na bar to compensation or \nrehabilitation. \n\nAffected persons should be \ncompensated in a timely manner. \n\nReview of Afghanistan Policy and ADB Requirement \n\n4. \nWhile  policies  and  laws  of  Afghanistan  pertaining  to  LAR  are  presented  in  the  LAR \nframework, Table A18.1 provides a comparison between ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \nand Afghanistan\u2019s Land Acquisition Law (LAL). \n \n\nTable A18.1: Comparison of ADB\u2019s Resettlement Policy and LAL of Afghanistan \n\nLand Acquisition Law  \nNational legislation does not provide for \npublic consultation. \n\nis \n\ninterest \n\nfor  public \n\nto  be \nLAR \ncompensated  based  on  equal  or  fair \nvalue  according  to  the  current  market \nrates.  In  case  of  residential  land,  land \nfor  land  is  offered.  Affected  orchards, \nvines, tree values will be valued by the \ncompetent authorities. \nLAL provides for compensation only for \ntitled  owners.  LAL  does  not  cover \naffected  persons  who  may  have \nusufruct or customary rights. \nLand  owners  or  users  rights  on  a  plot \nwill be terminated 3 months before the \nstart  of  civil  works  and  after \ncompensation  is  given  to  them.  The \ntermination  of  the  owner  or  user  right \nwould  not  affect  their  rights  to  collect \ntheir last harvest from the land, except \nin an emergency. \nCompensation at replacement rate will \nbe  given  for  land,  house,  crops,  and \ntrees losses. No consideration is given \nto income losses or relocation costs. \n\nLAR \n\nconsultation. \n\nRemarks or /Resolution \nNational  legislation  does  not  provide  for \npublic \nframework \nprovides  for  consultation  and  information \ndissemination. \nto  assess \nMarket  value \nreplacement  rates;  ADB  policy  and  LAL \nconcur  on  this  point.  However,  the  LAR \nframework  further  specifies  that  houses, \ncrops, or trees will also be compensated at \nreplacement rates.  \n\nis  a  way \n\nprovides \n\nLAR framework provides for compensation \nat  market  rate  for  titled  and  customary \nusers,  and  rehabilitation  for  those  without \ntitle. \nfor \ncrops \nLAR \nframework \ncompensation  whether \nthey  have  been \nharvested  or  not  to  avoid  civil  works  delays \nand pressures on land users to harvest a crop \nbefore  it  is  fully  ripe.  Land  users  harvesting \ntheir  crops  after  notification  of  the  land \noccupation date will not lose any part of their \ndue compensation. \nGeneral rehabilitation for income losses and \nfor  relocation  costs  will  be  given  if  these \nimpacts occur.  \n\nAffected persons should be \ncompensated and/or assisted, so as \nto guarantee at least the \nmaintenance of their pre-project \nlivelihood level. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, LAL = Land Acquisition Law, LAR = land acquisition and resettlement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \n \nC. \n\nResettlement Principles for the Program \n\nBased  on  this  analysis  of  national  provisions  and  ADB  policy  (Table  A18.1),  the  broad \n\n5. \nresettlement principles for this Investment Program will be the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAffected person impacts must be avoided or minimized as much as possible. \nIf impacts are unavoidable, the affected persons will be identified and assisted in \nimproving or regaining their standard of living. \nInformation  on  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  LAR  plan  will  be \ndisclosed  to  all  affected  persons,  and  people\u2019s  participation  will  be  ensured  in \nplanning  and  implementation.  All  LAR  plans  for  the  projects  with  resettlement \nimpacts will be disclosed to the affected persons. \nLand will be acquired for the project in accordance with the LAL of Afghanistan \nand ADB policy. The LAL specifies adequate compensation for the properties to \nbe acquired. Additional support would be extended for meeting the replacement \nvalue of the property. Affected persons who do not own land or other properties, \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n81\n\nbut have economic interests or lose their livelihoods, will be assisted according to \nthe broad principles described in this document. \nBefore  taking  possession  of  the  acquired  lands  and  properties,  compensation \nand resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) assistance will be paid in accordance \nwith the provision described in the respective resettlement plans. \nAn  entitlement  matrix  for  different  categories  of  affected  persons  has  been \nprepared  and  provisions  will  be  kept  in  the  budget  for  those  who  were  not \npresent  at  the  time  of  census  survey.  However,  people  moving  into  the  project \narea  after  the  cutoff  date  will  not  be  entitled  to  any  assistance.  In  case  of  land \nacquisition,  the  date  of  notification  for  acquisition  will  be  treated  as  the  cutoff \ndate.  For  non-titleholders,  such  as  squatters  and  encroachers,  the  date  of  the \nproject  census  survey  or  a  similar  designated  date  declared  by  the  executing \nagency will be considered the cutoff date. \nAppropriate grievance redress mechanisms will be established at the district level \nto ensure speedy resolution of disputes. \n\n(viii)  All  activities  related  to  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring \n\nwould ensure the involvement of women and other vulnerable groups. \nConsultations  with  affected  persons  will  continue  during  the  implementation  of \nthe LAR and rehabilitation.  \n\n \nAll  affected  families  and  affected  persons  will  be  entitled  to  a  combination  of \n6. \ncompensation and resettlement assistance, reflecting the type of asset lost, magnitude of loss, \ngeneral  impact  on  the  affected  person\u2019s  livelihood,  and  degree  of  the  affected  person\u2019s \nsocioeconomic vulnerability. The affected persons will be entitled to five types of compensation \nor  assistance:  (i)  compensation  for  loss  of  land  and  crops  or  trees  at  replacement  value;  (ii) \ncompensation  for  residential  or  commercial  structures  and  other  immovable  assets  at \nreplacement value; (iii) assistance in lieu of the loss of business or wage income; (iv) assistance \nfor shifting; and (v) rebuilding and/or restoration of community resources or facilities. \n \nD. \n\nCompensation Eligibility and Entitlements \n\n7. \nThis  LAR  framework  and  resettlement  procedural  guidelines  will  apply  to  all  projects \nunder  the  Investment  Program.  This  will  ensure  that  all  persons  affected  by  the  acquisition  of \nland  and  other  fixed  assets,  by  change  in  the  use  of  land,  and  by  the  restrictions  imposed  by \nproject activities on land use, will get appropriate compensation and rehabilitation assistance.  \n \n\n1. \n\nEligibility \n\n8. \nProject, are \n\nAffected persons entitled to compensation, or at least rehabilitation provisions under the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nall  persons  losing  land  with  or  without  title,  formal  land-use  rights,  or  traditional \nland-use rights; \ntenants whether registered or not; \nowners of buildings, crops, plants, or other objects attached to the land; and \npersons losing business, income, and salaries. \n\n \n9. \nCompensation eligibility will be limited by a cutoff date to be set at the end of the impacts \nassessment  and  affected  family/affected  person  census  carried  out  immediately  after  the \nconclusion of the detailed design. All affected families or affected persons who settle in affected \nareas after this date, and who cannot prove that they are displaced users of affected plots, will \nnot be eligible for compensation. DABS will inform local communities regarding the cutoff date \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nthrough their local offices and through the relevant local government agencies. However, they \nwill  be  given  sufficient  advance  notice  to  vacate  premises  or  dismantle  affected  structures \nbefore project implementation. Their dismantled structures will not be confiscated and they will \nnot pay fines or sanctions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEntitlements \n\n10. \nEntitlement  provisions  for  affected  persons  losing  land,  houses,  and  income  and \nrehabilitation subsidies will include provisions for permanent and temporary land losses, house \nand  buildings  losses,  crops  and  trees  losses,  a  relocation  subsidy,  and  a  business  losses \nallowance  based  on  tax  declarations  and/or  lump  sums.  These  entitlements  are  detailed  as \nfollows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\nPermanent loss of agricultural land will be compensated at replacement cost based \non  market  rates.  DABS  will  pay  costs  for  documentary  stamps  and  registration. \nAffected  persons  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  land  will  be  considered  severely \naffected and will receive an additional 1 year crop compensation quota or alternate \nland based on availability and in consultation with the local councils. \nTemporary land impacts will be compensated for crop losses only.  \nPermanent  loss  of  residential  or  commercial  land  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost based on market rates. DABS will pay transaction costs for titling \n(documentary  stamps,  registration  costs,  etc).  Valuation  will  not  discount  for \ndepreciation. \nLoss  of  communal  land  or  property  will  be  compensated  with  replacement  land  or \nproperty in the same village. \nBuildings or structures losses will be compensated in cash at replacement cost free \nof deductions on account of depreciation and transaction costs. A lump sum shifting \nallowance  based  on  the  current  years  prices  will  be  paid  for  each  affected \nhousehold. \nCrop losses will be compensated at market rate for the value of 1 year of production \nplus additional cash assistance at the current year\u2019s prices to purchase seeds and \nrestore future crop activities. \nFruit-bearing trees will be compensated at the value of 1 harvest times the number \nof years needed to re-grow a tree at the same productive level of the tree lost. Non-\nfruit-bearing  trees  will  be  compensated  at  the  cost  of  reproducing  a  tree  to  the \ngrowth level at which it was cut. Timber trees will be compensated at the commercial \nvalue of the wood times its volume. No deductions will be applied to the value of the \nwood left to the affected family.  \nLoss  of  business  will  be  compensated  with  a  lump  sum,  one-time  allowance  for  1 \nyear income for permanent loss and 6 months income for temporary loss. \nAgricultural land tenants, sharecroppers, and workers will be compensated in cash \nequal to 1 full year of income from the lost land. Agricultural workers whose contracts \nwill be interrupted will receive an indemnity equivalent to 3 months of income. \nLoss of community property will be compensated at full replacement value. \nVulnerable households will receive an additional 20% of the total compensation. \nIf  a  household\u2019s  land  is  found  to  be  not  viable  after  acquisition,  the  PMO  will  help \naffected  persons  prepare  a  deed  of  sale,  which  will  submitted  to  the  district \ngovernment to issue a qabala (title). This will be coordinated by the PMO, and the \ntitle will be transferred to the project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n83\n\nLand replacement values will be assessed based on a survey of land sales in project areas \n11. \nover the past 3 years and of government rates (if any) as per local revenue papers. If data on land \nmarket rates are unavailable, affected persons and competent authorities will negotiate land values \nand compensation for other assets.

DABS  as  the  EA  for  the  planning  and \nimplementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation program, which also involves the provincial \nand  district  governments.  The  PMO,  with  the  support  of  the  management  consultant  and  the \nimplementation  consultant,  will  coordinate  all  activities  related  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation.  All  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  relevant  local  government  agencies \nand community in which the projects will be implemented. \n \n\n1. \n\nAfghanistan Electricity Corporation (DABS) \n\nresponsibility \n\n13. \nSeveral  agencies  in  Afghanistan  are  involved  in  matters  related  to  land  administration, \nand  land  rights.  However,  they  are  currently  not  in  a  position  to  fully  exercise  their  mandates \nbecause  of  capacity  issues  and  weak  institutional  structures.  To  overcome  this  weakness, \nDABS  has  overall \nincluding  preparation, \nimplementation, and financing of all LAR tasks and cross-agency coordination. An environment \nand social unit (ESU) will be established within the PMO exclusively for this purpose and will be \nsupported  by  management  consultants.  The  ESU  will  be  responsible  internally  for  monitoring \nLAR  plan  preparation  and  implementation  (including  surveys,  asset  valuation,  and  community \nconsultation),  LAR-related  cross-agency  and  interdepartmental  coordination,  and  LAR  plan \napproval. Land acquisition will involve the following: \n \n\nInvestment  Program, \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nAn ESU will be established in the PMO to handle all LAR. \nInternational  and  national  resettlement  specialists  will  be  provided  through  the \nmanagement consultants.

Further,  their \ncooperation will be solicited while conducting the inventory of affected assets and the census of \naffected persons. The affected persons will be consulted and their views on the project layout \nand design, as well as their preferences on compensation and/or other resettlement assistance, \nwill  be  recorded  and  given  due  consideration  in  project  planning.  Information  about  the \nentitlement provisions and compensation packages will be shared with the affected persons and \ntheir  comments  and  suggestions  will  be  incorporated  in  the  LAR  plan.  LAR  plans  will  detail \nprocesses  and  mechanisms  to  ensure  the  affected  person\u2019s  involvement.  The  plans  also  will \ninclude  an  appendix  with  a  list  of  the  consultation  meetings  held  with  date,  number  of \nparticipants, and minutes of matters discussed. \n \n\n \n\n14. \n \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nThe LAR framework in the local language (Dari) will be disclosed to the affected persons \n16. \nat the PMO; the same will be done for the LAR plans after the endorsement by EA. The LAR \nframework  and LAR plan in English will be posted on ADB\u2019s website after its endorsement by \nthe  EA.  Each  LAR  plan  will  be  made  available  in  Dari.  A  LAR  information  leaflet  with  LAR \ninformation,  including  measurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and \nspecial  provisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments  and  displacement  schedule,  will \nbe  made  available  in  Dari  and  distributed  to  affected  persons.  The  LAR  framework  and  LAR \nplans disclosure will be a condition to proceed to project appraisal. \n \nG. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\nAn  adequate  grievance  redress  mechanism  for  affected  persons  will  be  established \n\n17. \nbased on a three-stage procedure for redress of grievances and complaints. \n \n18. \nThe  ESU  will  design  a  pro  forma  letter  to  be  used  by  the  affected  persons  for  filing \ncomplaints. Literate local leaders will be identified for each project to assist the affected persons \nin filling out the form, and to assist them at every stage of the complaints process. Moreover, the \nimplementing NGO will help the affected persons in preparing the grievance note and sending it \nto the concerned authority.  \n \nH. \n\nResettlement Budget \n\n19. \nThe EA will prepare detailed budgets for each LAR plan. The budget will be included in \nthe  overall  cost  estimates  for  projects.  The  budget  will  detail  (i)  costs  for  land  acquisition, \nhouses,  crops,  relocation,  and  income  restoration;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  (iii)  arrangements  for \napproval;  (iv)  flow  of  funds;  and  (v)  a  15%  contingency.  The  EA  will  provide  all  funds  for  land \nacquisition.  All  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation,  and  rehabilitation  of  income  and \nlivelihood will be considered an integral component of project costs. The EA will keep advance \nprovisional budget in its annual plan for LAR costs. \n\nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nLAR  tasks  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  subjected  to  internal  and  external \n20. \nmonitoring.  Internal  monitoring  will  be  conducted  by  the  ESU  of  the  PMO,  assisted  by  the \nimplementation  consultant.  External  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an agency  recruited  by  the \nPMO. ADB will prepare the terms of reference for the external monitoring agency (EMA) before \nLAR plan implementation begins.  \n \n\n1. \n\nInternal Monitoring \n\n21. \nThe PMO, through the ESU, will routinely carry out internal monitoring, and the results \nwill  be  communicated  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  project  implementation  reports.  Indicators \nrelated to the process, immediate outputs, and results will be used for internal monitoring. This \ninformation will be collected directly from the field and reported monthly to the PMO to assess \nthe  progress  and  results  of  LAR  plan  implementation,  and  to  adjust  the  work  program  if \nnecessary. The monthly reports will be consolidated every quarter in the standard supervision \nreports  and  submitted  to  ADB.  The  following  will  be  monitoring  benchmarks:  (i)  information \ncampaign and consultation with affected persons, (ii) status of land acquisition and payments on \nland compensation, (iii) compensation for affected structures and other assets, (iv) relocation of \naffected persons, (v) payments for loss of income, (vi) selection and distribution of replacement \nland, and (vii) income-restoration activities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n87\n\n2. \n\nExternal Monitoring \n\n22. \nExternal monitoring will be carried out twice a year, and the results will be communicated \nto  the  PMO  and  ADB  through  semiannual  reports.  The  EMA  will  be  recruited  annually  on  an \nintermittent  basis  up  to  1  year  after  the  project  works  are  completed.  The  EMA  will  also  be \nresponsible for (i) issuing a no-objection certification to proceed with work in sections of lots of \nthe project where there is no land acquisition; and (ii) for sections or lots where LAR is required, \ncompleting  an  audit  confirming  that  all  compensation  and  related  resettlement  assistance  in \ncash  or  kind  has  been  delivered  to  the  affected  households  before  issuing  no-objection  to \nproceed.  A  copy  of  the  no-objection  certificate  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMO  (ESU), \nimplementation consultant, and ADB simultaneously.  \n \n23. \nThe EMA will also assess the status of vulnerable groups affected by the project, such \nas  households  headed  by  women,  disabled  and/or  elderly  and  poor  families.  The  indicators \ndeveloped  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project  will  be  based  on  the  following:  (i) \nsocioeconomic  conditions  of  the  affected  persons  after  resettlement;  (ii)  communications  and \nreactions  from  affected  persons  on,  among  other  things,  entitlements,  compensation,  options, \nalternative developments, and relocation timetables; (iii) changes in housing and income levels; \n(iv)  rehabilitation  of  squatters;  (v)  valuation  of  property;  (vi)  grievance  procedures;  (vii) \ndisbursement  of  compensation;  and  (viii)  level  of  satisfaction  of  affected  persons  after \nresettlement. \n \n24. \nFor each project, the EMA will carry out an evaluation of the LAR plan about 1 year after \nits  implementation.  The  main  reason  for  this  study  is  to  find  out  whether  the  plan  objectives \nwere  attained.  The  socioeconomic  survey  baseline  will  be  used  to  compare  pre-  and  post-\nproject conditions. The EMA will recommend supplemental assistance for the affected persons if \nthe study shows that the objectives of the LAR plan have not been attained. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 November 2008) \n", "Currency Unit \nAF1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "Afghani/s (AF) \n$0.0193 \nAF51.80 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nAfghanistan National Development Strategy \nCentral Asian Power System \nCountry Partnership Strategy \nCountry Strategy and Program Update \nDa Afghanistan Breshna Moassassa  \n(Afghanistan Electricity Organization) \nDa Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat  \n(Afghanistan Electricity Corporation) \ndesign and monitoring framework \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nframework financing agreement \nInter-Ministerial Commission for Energy \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nland acquisition and resettlement \nlimited international bidding \nMinistry of Energy and Water \nmultitranche financing facility \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Mines \nnational competitive bidding \nNorth East Power System \nNational Solidarity Program \noperation and maintenance \nperiodic financing request \nprogram management office \npower purchase agreement \ntechnical assistance \nterms of reference \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB \nADF \nANDS \nCAPS \nCPS \nCSPU \nDABM \n", "DABS \n", "DMF \nEA \nEARF \nFFA \nICE \nIEE \nJFPR \nLAR \nLIB \nMEW \nMFF \nMIS \nMOM \nNCB \nNEPS \nNSP \nO&M \nPFR \nPMO \nPPA \nTA \nTOR \nUSAID \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "ii \n", " \n", " \n \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "GJ \nGWh \nkm  \nkV \nkVA \nkW \nkWh \nMVA \nMW \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gigajoules (1 billion joules) \ngigawatt-hour (1,000,000 kilowatt-hours) \nkilometer (1,000 meters) \nkilovolt (1,000 volts) \nkilovolt-ampere \nkilowatt (1,000 watts) \nkilowatt-hour \nmegavolt-ampere (1,000 kilovolt-ampere) \nmegawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 20 March.
