The project  will demonstrate  environmental  improvement  and \ngreen development in rural areas by (i) improving rural waste and sanitation management facilities \nand  services  with  innovative  technologies  and  arrangements,  (ii)  developing  local-featured \necological  agricultural  and  forestry  products, 1  and  (iii)  adding  value  to  local  agricultural  and \nforestry products through improvement of value chains and promotion of ecotourism.2  The project \nis  envisaged  to  (i)  play  a  demonstrative  role  for  rural  vitalization,  (ii)  reduce  the  risk  of  future \npandemics,  (iii)  promote  recovery  from  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  through  inclusive \nrural economic development,  and (iv) generate knowledge  and disseminate  best practice. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n2. \nAs one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC, the Yangtze River Economic \nBelt (YREB) and its nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for more \nthan 40% of the PRC\u2019s population and freshwater  resources, and 45% of the country\u2019s economic \noutput.3 While  the YREB  has  benefited  from  extensive  development  since the  1990s,  economic \ngrowth  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  Basin  significantly  lags  the  lower \nreaches;  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  face  particular  challenges  from  (i)  weak  institutional \ncapacities  and  poor  coordination  between  institutions;  (ii)  increasing  pollution  and  pressure  on \nnatural resources;  (iii) slow transformation  into green development;  and (iv) limited  integration of \nwaterways,  ports, and intermodal  logistics. To manage  these challenges,  the Government  of the \nPRC formulated the YREB Development  Plan, 2016\u20132030.4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  the government  have  agreed  to adopt  a  framework  approach  to support  the plan,  focusing \non (i) institutional  strengthening  and policy  reform,  (ii) ecosystem  restoration  and  environmental \nprotection,  (iii) green  industrial  transformation,  and (iv)  construction  of an  integrated  multimodal \ntransport corridor. \n\nIn many rural areas of the YREB, agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged \n3. \nbehind  industrial  production  and  urban  livelihoods,  and  income  inequality  and  poverty  are  still \npersistent.  The  majority  of  rural  wastewater  and  other  wastes  are  being  directly  discharged  to \nwaterways;  and  solid  waste,  particularly  plastic  waste,  is  increasing.  To  promote  poverty \nreduction,  rural  development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth,  the  government  formulated  the \nNational  Strategic  Plan  for  Rural  Vitalization,  2018\u20132022. 5  The  strategic  plan  focuses  on \nagricultural  modernization;  rural  wastewater  and  waste  management;  rural\u2013urban  integration; \necosystem  services  protection;  rural  health  and  education  services  development;  rural \ngovernance  reform, including enhancement  of policy frameworks;  institutional and organizational \ndevelopment;  and capacity building. \n\n \n\n1  For  this  project,  local-featured  products  refer to products  which are  produced  or  harvested  in a  local  area,  making \nthe  best  use  of the  local  climate, geographic  conditions,  and  resources;  represent  and  make the area  famous; are \ndemanded  by other areas;  and provide  livelihood  opportunities  and  develop economy in the area. \n\n2  Green  development  is  a  sustainable  development  concept  underpinned  by  three  pillars:  (i)  environmental \nresponsiveness,  (ii) resource efficiency, and  (iii) community and cultural  inclusiveness.  It enables  a single  project to \napproach  environmental  protection  and inclusive  economic development  in an integrated  manner. \n\n3  The  other  key economic growth  engines  are the  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  and  the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Integrated \n\nRegional  Development  Strategy. \n\n4  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Beijing. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nAs  part  of the  YREB,  the  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefecture  (Xiangxi)  is in \n4. \nHunan Province,  and is between the Yangtze  River and the PRC\u2019s designated  special economic \nzones.6 Xiangxi is also at the border between the central and western PRC and is the only part of \nHunan  that is targeted  under the  China Western  Development  policy.7 Xiangxi  has  one city  and \nseven counties;  and a land area of 15,462 square  kilometers,  which is dominated  by mountains; \nabout 70.2% of the mountainous area is forest; and urban areas comprise 556 square kilometers. 8 \nAt the end of 2018, the total registered population of Xiangxi was 3.0 million, with 54% being rural \nresidents. The ethnic population,  mainly the Miao and Tujia people, accounts for 80% of the total \npopulation of Xiangxi. The total production value in Xiangxi was CNY58.3 billion in 2017, of which \nCNY8.4  billion  was  by  the  primary  industry,  CNY17.9  billion  by  the  secondary  industry,  and \nCNY31.9  billion  by  the  tertiary  industry.  The  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was \nCNY26,691  in 2019. \n\n5. \nXiangxi  is  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  the  PRC.  All  of  its  seven  counties  are  national \npoverty counties designated  by the Government  of the PRC. At the end of 2018, the incidence of \nrural poverty  in Xiangxi  was 5.2%  and urban  poverty  4.3%. Of  the 49.2 million  cubic meters  per \nyear of wastewater  in Xiangxi, only 7.4 million cubic meters per year are treated. About 24.7% of \nthe  villages  do  not  have  solid  waste  collection  or processing  facilities.  Garbage  classification  is \nnot  practiced;  but  is  needed  for  the  reduction  and  recycling  of  garbage,  particularly  for  plastic \nwaste.  Residents  do  not  have  adequate  capacity  for  solid  waste  management,  including \nclassification  and recycling,  and institutional  capacities  for solid waste  management  is still weak. \nAbout 48.2% of households  do not have sanitary toilets. The lack of wastewater  and solid waste \nmanagement  negatively  impacts the living environment  and health of Xiangxi\u2019s  rural residents. \n\nThe mountainous  landscape in Xiangxi makes farming less suitable  and profitable.  There \n6. \nare  135,000  hectares  of  arable  land,  which  is only  8.7%  of the  total  land area.  Xiangxi  has  rich \nlocal-featured vegetation. Agricultural GDP is CNY14 billion, or 14.4% of the total GDP in Xiangxi. \nAbout 60% of the agricultural  GDP is from local-featured  products,  given the prefecture\u2019s  unique \nclimate and biosphere. These products include citrus, kiwifruit, camellia, tea, and herbal medicine. \nHowever,  yields  are  highly  variable  and  of  low  value  because  of  the  poor  quality  of  seeds  and \nseedlings, use of chemical fertilizer and pesticide (resulting in nonpoint source pollution), outdated \nagricultural  and forestry  production and management  systems, and inadequate  cold chains. \n\n7. \nThe  Government  of  the PRC  designated  Xiangxi  as  Tujia  and  Miao  Cultural  Ecosystem \nConservation  Area,  one  of  the  seven  National  Cultural  Ecosystem  Conservation  Areas  in  the \nPRC. 9  There  are  three  national  nature  reserves,  three  national  forest  parks,  three  national \ngeological parks, two national scenic spots, one national wetland park, and a World Heritage Site \nof  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (the  Tusi  site  at \nLaosicheng in Yongshun County). All these reserves and parks are of high ecological and cultural \nvalue,  attracting  57.2  million  visitors  in  2019.  Seven  expressways  connecting  local  cities  and \ncounties  have  been  opened  successively  in  Xiangxi.  Xiangxi  is  becoming  part  of  an  economic \ncircle, including Changsha,  Chongqing,  Guilin, and Guiyang, with the construction  of the Zhang\u2013\n\n \n\n6  The  PRC designated  Shantou,  Shenzhen,  and  Zhuhai  in  Guangdong  Province; Xiamen  in Fujian  Province; and  all \nof Hainan  Province  as  special  economic zones  during  1980\u20131984.  The  special  economic zones  are given  special \neconomic policies  and flexible governmental  measures,  which attract firms to do business  there. \n\n7  China  Western  Development  is a policy adopted  in 1999  to develop the  western  regions  that  were severely lagging \n\n8  Xiangxi\u2019s  one  city  is  Jishou  City  and  its  seven  counties  are  Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan, \n\n9  National  Cultural  Ecosystem Conservation  Area is a specific area designated  by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism \n\nLuxi, and Yongshun  counties. \n\nbehind. \n\nof the PRC. \n\n \n\n\fJihuai high-speed  railway and the Xiangxi  Airport.10 Xiangxi also plays a leading role in industrial \nintegration in the PRC with a national agricultural technology  zone in Huayuan County and a pilot \nindustrial zone in Yongshun County. \n\nHowever,  Xiangxi\u2019s  unique  combination  of  natural  and  cultural  diversity  (with  high \n8. \necological  and  cultural  value)  as well  as its  transportation  and agricultural  advantages  have  not \nbeen fully utilized to enhance residents\u2019 living conditions and livelihood opportunities.  The poverty \nratio remains  high; institutional  capacities  are weak; and job opportunities  are limited, especially \nfor women in Xiangxi. To increase rural industrial  productivity, generate job opportunities,  reduce \npoverty  and  inequality,  and  empower  women  and enhance  gender  equality,  Xiangxi\u2019s  approach \nto rural  vitalization  includes  (i) producing  organically  certified  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry \nproducts;  (ii) adding  value  to local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry products  through \nvalue chain improvements  (production, processing,  and marketing) and promotion of ecotourism; \nand (iii) strengthening  institutions  and building capacities. \n\n9. \nThe  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous  Prefectural  Government  (XPG)  places  rural \nvitalization  at  the  core  of  its  development  agenda.  The  Xiangxi  Tujia  and  Miao  Autonomous \nPrefecture  Rural  Vitalization  Strategy  adopts a targeted  approach  to poverty  alleviation,  and the \nXiangxi  Autonomous  Prefecture  Accelerated  Three-Year  Action  Plan \nto  Improve  Rural \nEnvironment  and  Build  Beautiful  Villages,  2018\u20132020 \nfocuses  on  rural  environmental \nimprovement.  The  strategy  and  the  plan  identify  the  key  growth  engines  for  Xiangxi  to  realize \nhigh-value agricultural and forestry products and ecotourism backed by research, technology, and \nvalue chain development  and supported by institutional and capacity development. \n\nXiangxi  is  an  appropriate  demonstration  area  for  rural  environmental  improvement  and \n10. \ngreen  development  since  it (i) is one of the poorest  regions  in the PRC,  (ii) is an important  area \nto  connect  the  central  and  western  regions  of  the  PRC  and  the  Yangtze  River  and  special \neconomic zones in the southern provinces, (iii) has agricultural and forestry products with potential \nfor further development,  (iv) has unique tourism resources  and environmental  and transportation \nadvantages,  and  (v)  plays  a  leading  role  in  industrial  integration  in  the  PRC  through  its  two \nindustrial zones. \n\nCOVID-19  pandemic.  The COVID-19  pandemic  that began in the beginning  of 2020 has \n11. \namplified  the interlinkages  between  biodiversity,  public health,  and ecosystem-dependent  global \nsupply  chains.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  is  being  contained  in  the  PRC;  but  it  remains  a  risk, \nparticularly  for  rural remote  areas that  depend  on tourism.  With growing  recognition  of the need \nfor measures  to prevent  the spread of infectious  diseases  in the future, rural vitalization  is a key \npart of the PRC\u2019s recovery from COVID-19. \n\n12. \nStrategic  fit.  The  project  will  demonstrate  environmental  improvement  and  green \ndevelopment  through  natural  capital  investment  in  the  rural  areas  of Xiangxi.  This  is consistent \nwith  (i)  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,11 which  aims  to  eradicate  extreme \npoverty  and  balance  the  development  of  rural  and  urban  areas  for  improvement  of  agricultural \nproductivity  and  rural  incomes;  (ii) the  PRC\u2019s  rural  vitalization  strategy  for 2018\u20132022  (footnote \n5),  which  promotes  poverty  reduction,  rural  development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth;  (iii) \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,12 which  (a)  emphasizes  the importance  of  addressing  remaining  poverty, \n\n10 The Zhang\u2013Jihuai  high-speed  railway and the Xiangxi Airport are scheduled  to be operational  in 2021. \n11 Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.

Based on its international  experience  and knowledge, \nADB  has  added  innovative  features  to  the  project,  including  but  not  limited  to  (i)  distributed \nwastewater management systems, which have advantages over the traditional centralized system \nsuch as lower operation cost; (ii) a public\u2013private partnership appropriate for the O&M of the small \nwastewater  management  systems  in  rural  areas  (ADB  funding  will  induce  private  sector\u2019s \nparticipation  in and financing  for the  O&M); (iii)  garbage  classification  and  recycling  (particularly \nrecycling of plastic); (iv) technologies to produce  quality local-featured  ecological  agricultural and \nforestry  products;  (v)  methodologies  to  add  value  to  local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and \nforestry  products,  including  improvement  of  value  chains  and  integration  of  agriculture  and \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nforestry  with  ecotourism;  and  (vi) institutional  and  capacity  development  for the management  of \nrural  waste, the  development  of local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and  forestry  products,  and \nthe value addition  to the local products.   \n\nNature-positive  recovery  from the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  project  will contribute  to \n20. \nholistic  development  in the YREB  by prioritizing  investments  in  natural capital  conservation  and \nrestoration  and  shifting traditional  investments  toward  the valuing  of nature  and the reduction  of \ninequalities in rural areas. Rural vitalization is a key part of the nature-positive  stimulus packages \nfor recovery  from the COVID-19  pandemic, aimed at building resilience in the YREB in the short, \nmedium,  and  longer  terms.  Nature-based  approaches  focus  on  natural  capital  investments, \nincluding promotion of waste and sanitation management,  climate resilience, resilient sustainable \nagriculture,  and  sustainable  value  chains.  With  the  integration  of  nature-based  solutions,  the \nproject  will  introduce  complementary  elements  across  sectors  to  address  multi-dimensional \nissues  with  a  multi-stakeholder  approach.  By  promoting  greener  and  healthier  growth  models \nwhich will  focus on nature  and strengthen  institutional  and  governance  mechanisms,  the project \nwill create a safe and healthy living environment,  reducing  the risk of epidemics  in the future. \n\n21. \nKnowledge  management  and  dissemination.  Experiences  and  knowledge  gained \nthrough  the project will be disseminated  and replicated  in other poor rural  areas in the PRC and \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  One  of  the  main  vehicles  to  share  knowledge  and  an \naccelerator  for  nature-positive  investments  will  be  the  Natural  Capital  Lab,  currently  under \ndevelopment.  It will provide a regional  platform to scale natural  capital investments  and create  a \nmarketplace  for  nature-positive  recovery  solutions  with  sustained  impacts.  Project  results  and \nlessons will be leveraged through  the ADB\u2212PRC  Regional Knowledge  Sharing Initiative.17  Some \nof  the  outputs  for  knowledge  sharing  will  be  workshops;  publication  of  high-quality  knowledge \nproducts,  including  working  papers  and  academic  articles;  e-learning  activities;  strategic \npartnership  with centers  of excellence;  policy toolkits; and award programs.  \n\nD. \n\nSummary  Cost Estimates  and Financing Plan \n\n22. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  \u20ac356.00  million  (Table  1).

A project  leading  group  has  been  established  in \nthe  XPG  under  which  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established.  The  eight \nimplementing  agencies  will be the governments  of the one city (Jishou  City) and seven counties \n(Baojing,  Fenghuang,  Guzhang,  Huayuan,  Longshan,  Luxi,  and  Yongshun)  in  Xiangxi.  In  each \nimplementing  agency,  a  local  project  leading  group  has  been  established,  under  which  a  local \nPMO  has also  been established.  The implementation  arrangements  are summarized  in Table  3 \nand described  in detail in the PAM (footnote 18).

Recommendations  by  ADB,  including \naddition  of innovative  technologies  and  arrangements,  were  incorporated  in the  project  design. \nThe technical feasibility  was confirmed  to be adequate after detailed  examination of the project\u2019s \ncompatibility  with local  conditions  and  local capacity  for  O&M. Designs  of wastewater  treatment \nplants,  field  weather  stations,  drainage  ditches,  irrigation  systems,  a  pump,  roads,  green  crop \ndisease and pest control, and capacity development  were determined, considering  risks that may \nbe caused  by climate change (such as increasing frequency  and extent of floods and droughts). \n\nB. \n\nEconomic  and Financial  Viability \n\nThe economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an expected \n28. \neconomic internal rate of return of 12.8% and an economic net present value of CNY610.0 million \nbased on a 9% social discount rate. The analysis also confirmed economic viability of all outputs, \n\n \n\n\fwith  individual  economic  internal  rates  of return  of 13.0%  for  output  1,  12.7%  for  output  2,  and \n12.0%  for output  3.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the project\u2019s  economic  viability  is sufficiently \nrobust to negative  scenarios,  such as an increase in investment  cost, a decrease  in benefits, an \nincrease  in  the  O&M  cost,  and  a  delay  in  the  achievement  of  benefits.  The  project\u2019s  switching \nvalue for cost overrun is 51.6%, and 33.3% for a decrease  in benefits. The distributional analysis \nthat estimated the project\u2019s  economic net present value yields a poverty  impact ratio of 0.21, i.e., \nthe poor are expected to receive 21% of project benefits. \n\nThe financial  analysis includes  financial  evaluations  of all the revenue-generating  project \n29. \nactivities  and  fiscal  analyses  of  the  XPG  and  the  eight  implementing  agencies  to  respectively \ndetermine the financial viability and financial sustainability.21  The financial evaluations reveal that \nfor  nine  of  the  11  revenue-generating  subprojects,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  each \nsubproject  exceeds  the  weighted  cost  of  capital,  indicating  that  these  nine  subprojects  are \nfinancially  viable.  The  two remaining  subprojects  will  be able  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  to \ncover  the  recurrent  O&M  costs.  The  fiscal  analyses  demonstrate \nthat,  with  provincial \ngovernments\u2019  continued  financial  support,  the  XPG and  all the eight  implementing  agencies  will \nhave  adequate  financial  capacity  to  cover  the  incremental  recurrent  O&M  costs  for  all  the \nsubprojects.  The project is considered  financially sustainable. \n\nC. \n\nSustainability \n\n30. \nAdequate  consulting services  will be provided during project implementation  for technical \nsupport,  capacity  development,  and  knowledge  dissemination  for outputs  1, 2,  and 3. The  XPG \nand  the implementing  agencies  will  (i) organize  and  implement  training  on  the O&M  of  facilities \nconstructed  under the project,  technologies  for local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and forestry \nproducts,  and integration  of agriculture  and forestry  with ecotourism,  which  will be fully financed \nby ADB; and (ii) conduct  or ensure O&M for the facilities constructed  under the project. \n\nD. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate. 22  Key  financial \n31. \nmanagement  risks  include  (i)  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures  and \nrequirements,  which  could  delay  project  implementation;  and  (ii)  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial  management  requirements,  particularly  on  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  which \nmay delay project reporting and detailed identification of issues on the use of loan proceeds. The \nidentified  financial  management  risks will  be mitigated  through  the financial  management  action \nplan described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n\n32. \nThe strategic procurement planning assessed the procurement risks and identified optimal \nprocurement packages that will mitigate such risks, given the capacity constraints within the XPG, \nwide distribution of implementing agencies, and complex topographic conditions. Value for money \nwill  be  delivered  by  hiring  a  procurement  agency  to  support  the  XPG  and  enable  high-quality \ncontrol for the design and implementation  of the large number of packages  to be procured. Some \ncontract packages  will introduce  best international  practices and technologies;  and promote best \nO&M  arrangements  for  the  small  wastewater  management  systems  in  rural  areas,  including \n\n \n\n21 Financial  Analysis  (accessible  from the list  of linked documents  in Appendix  2). \n22 The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  from May  to  June  2020  in  accordance  with  ADB.  2005. \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis of  Projects. Manila;  and  ADB. 2009.  Financial  Due Diligence:  A Methodology \nNote. Manila. The COVID-19 pandemic did not affect the financial  management assessment  since the XPG and the \nimplementing  agencies  were  back  to  normal  operations  before  the  financial  management  assessment  was \nconducted. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\npublic\u2013private  partnerships. \n\n33. \nOverall,  procurement  risk  is  low  after  mitigation  measures  are  undertaken.  A  market \nanalysis  confirms that there  are an adequate  number  of qualified  local suppliers  and contractors \nfor all  works and  goods  contract  packages  for  the project.  To achieve  better value  for money  in \nprocurement,  the project will adopt open competitive bidding with national advertisement  for most \nADB-financed  works  and  goods  packages.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  international \nadvertisement  will  be  used  only  for  two  large  consulting  services  packages  for  project \nmanagement  and technical support, capacity  development,  and knowledge dissemination. \n \n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained  to and discussed \nwith the government and the XPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n\nE. \n\nPoverty, Social,  and Gender \n\nPoverty  and  social.  The  project  is  classified  general  intervention  for  poverty  reduction. \n35. \nThe  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  based  on  extensive  stakeholder  consultations \nand  socioeconomic  surveys.  A total  of  422,022  residents  in  the project  area,  including  108,702 \npoor  or low-income  people  (25.8%),  will directly  benefit  from the  project  through  improved  rural \nwaste  and  sanitation  management,  development  of  local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and \nforestry products, and value addition to local-featured ecological agricultural and forestry products \nthrough  improvement  of  value  chains  and  promotion  of  ecotourism.  It  is  estimated  that  1,317 \nskilled  and 5,612  unskilled  local  jobs will be  created  during construction  and operation.  A social \ndevelopment  action  plan  has  been  prepared,  with  specific  targets  for  the  poor  and  low-income \npeople.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with  residents  and  other  stakeholders  during  project \npreparation.  A  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  project  implementation  is  included  in  the \nPAM (footnote 18). \n\n36. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.23  A gender  analysis  undertaken  during project  preparation  indicated  that (i) 64.6% of \nsurveyed  women  were  engaged  in  farming  and  casual  work,  (ii)  women  had  a  low  level  of \nparticipation in public affairs (34.5% of village committee members and 4.8% of village committee \nheads were women), (iii) women had low levels of educational attainment (only 8.4% of surveyed \nwomen  had  college  or  university  degrees),  and  (iv)  women \nlacked  income-generating \nopportunities. The project opens up opportunities for women to participate in and benefit equitably \nfrom  the  project  activities,  particularly  from  (i)  skills  training  and  entrepreneurship  opportunities \nfor  agricultural  and  forestry  products  and  ecotourism,  (ii)  job  opportunities,  and  (iii)  improved \nsanitation  services.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  that  includes  (i)  promotion  of \nwomen\u2019s  entrepreneurship  and  management  capacity  in  agriculture  and  ecotourism;  (ii)  quotas \nfor skills training  on advanced  technologies  for local-featured  ecological  agricultural  and forestry \nproducts; (iii) integration of women\u2019s needs in the design of e-commerce  platforms; (iv) quotas for \nskilled  and  unskilled  job  opportunities  created  by  the  project;  (v)  consultations  on  subprojects\u2019 \npreliminary designs and tariff proposals, with at least 40% surveyed women; and (vi) participation \nin  paid  rural  garbage  management  teams,  with  at  least  30%  female  participants.  Key  gender \ntargets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. \n\n37. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n23 ADB. 2012.  Guidelines  for Gender Mainstreaming  Categories  of ADB Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\fcategories  are as follows.24 \n\nEnvironment \n\n(category  B).  An \n\ninitial  environmental  examination, \n\n38. \nincluding  an \nenvironmental management  plan (EMP) and grievance redress mechanism,25  has been prepared \nand  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  initial  environmental  examination  is  based  on  domestic \nfeasibility studies and environmental assessments,  site visits, and stakeholder  consultations. The \nEMP will be applied to all project components.  The XPG, through its PMO, will be responsible for \nimplementation  of and compliance with the EMP, including mitigation  measures, monitoring,  and \nreporting.  Qualified  full-time  environment  officers  will  be  assigned  to  the  XPG  PMO  and  local \nPMOs,  and  a training  program  has been  included  in the  EMP.  The project  will contribute  to the \nXPG\u2019s targets for environmental improvement,  including afforestation and improved water quality. \nRisks  include  soil  erosion  and  temporary  disturbance  to  nearby  residents  (e.g.,  from  dust  and \nnoise) during works; and air, soil, and/or water pollution during operations because of inadequate \nO&M of the project facilities.  The outbreak and global spread  of COVID-19  presents  a risk to the \nhealth  of workers  and residents.
