The  loan \nwill be accompanied by a technical assistance (TA) grant of $500,000.  \n \nThe reduction of poverty is of the highest priority for the Government of \nthe  Philippines.  Poverty  rates  have  declined  in  the  Philippines  in  the \npast  two  decades,  however,  the  absolute  number  of  poor  people  has \nincreased to over 26 million. The second Quarter 2005 Social Weather \nSurvey reported that economic conditions for the people continue to be \nharsh,  as  57%  of  household  heads  regard  their  households  as  poor, \nand  12%  report  that  their  households  experienced  hunger  at  least \nonce in the last three months. \n \nAccess to microfinance services can improve household incomes and \nreduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  of  the  poor.  Access  to  microfinance \nservices can help the poor build viable businesses and pursue income-\ngenerating  activities.  Microfinance  is  the  central  strategy  for  poverty \nreduction  in  the  Philippines  under  Republic  Act  8425  (Social  Reform \nand  Poverty  Alleviation  Act)  and  is  an  important  part  of  the  Medium- \nTerm Philippine Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010 and the current \nadministration\u2019s  10-point  agenda.  Although \nthe  Philippines  has \nachieved  good  progress  in  promoting  microfinance,  more  than  two-\nthirds of poor households, or 17 million people, still do not have access \nto microfinance services. Critical actions must now be taken to develop \na  sound  foundation  to  develop  microfinance  further  at  a  much \nsubstantially  accelerated  pace  in  order  to  achieve  the  national \noutreach and necessary sustainability. \n \nMDP  will  support \nthe  systemic \nweaknesses  in  the  sector  and  achieve  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  including  eradication  of  extreme  poverty  and  hunger,  and  the \npromotion of gender equality and empowerment of women. It aims to \npromote  permanent  access \nto  sustainable,  competitively-priced \nfinancial services for the poor and their microenterprises. It is aligned \nwith  the  G-8  Action  Plan  for  poverty  reduction,  best  practices  of  the \nConsultative  Group \n(CGAP),  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Microfinance Development Strategy.  \n \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  MDP  is  to  improve  household  incomes, \nreduce  poverty,  and  reduce  vulnerability  of  the  poor.  To  achieve  this \nobjective, the MDP will undertake strategic reforms to: \n \n(i)  enhance  the  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment  and \nremove  regulatory  impediments  and  policy  distortions  to  promote \nmarket  efficiencies  and \nincreased  outreach  of  services  at \ncompetitive prices to the poor; \n\nthe  Government \n\nto  address \n\nto  Assist \n\nthe  Poor \n\nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector \nAssessment \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nProgram Monitoring \nand Tranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \nand Implementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n(ii)  build  viable  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  can  provide \nefficient and cost-effective retail delivery of services to the poor; \n(iii) strengthen regulatory and supervisory capacities and oversight for \n\na sound microfinance sector; and  \n\n(iv) increase  financial  literacy  and  consumer  protection  for  the  poor \n\nand users of microfinance services. \n\n \nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nSector: Finance \nSub-sector: Microfinance \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; inclusive social \n    development; gender and development \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets; \n    gender equity in empowerment and rights \n \nCategory C \n \n \nCategory C: Involuntary resettlement \nCategory B: Impact on indigenous peoples \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reforms  by \nproviding a loan of $150 million. The Borrower will be the Republic of \nthe Philippines. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest \nrate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set \nforth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \nutilized over a period of 24 months from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nThe program period will be 24 months. The loan will be released in two \ntranches. The first tranche of $75 million will be made available upon \nthe  Government  meeting  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness  including \nsatisfactory  compliance  with  first  tranche  conditions.  The  second \ntranche  of  $75  million,  which  is  expected  to  be  released  within  24 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance with agreed-upon conditions.    \n \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nMDP  and  provide  overall  guidance  for  project  implementation.  The \nimplementing agencies will include Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), \nBureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Cooperative Development Authority \n(CDA),  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission  (NAPC),  Philippine  Postal \nSavings Bank (PPSB), and the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC). NAPC is the mandated oversight body under the Social Reform \nand  Poverty  Alleviation  Act  (RA 8425)  for  the  development  and \nstrengthening of the microfinance industry. The National Credit Council \n(NCC) Secretariat has been nominated by the Secretary of Finance to \nbe the program management unit (PMU) to oversee implementation of \nthe  program  and  to  coordinate  activities  among  the  participating \ninter-agency  committees  chaired  by  DOF, \nagencies.  The  NCC \nthe  National  Economic  and \nincluding \n\nrepresentatives \n\nfrom \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nimports \n\nimports  minus \n\nthe  Philippines\u2019 \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\nDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA),  and  other  participating  agencies,  will \nprovide ongoing forums to facilitate sector reforms.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans,  a  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  to  disburse  the  loan \nproceeds  based  on  certification  to  be  provided  by  the  Borrower.    No \nsupporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  if  during  each  year \nthat  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  the \nfrom \ntotal \nRepublic  of \nnonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under \nother  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nloan  proceeds  and  verify \nthe  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n \nThe counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be \nused  to  finance  the  associated  structural  adjustment  costs  and \nthe  development  of  a \nthe  MDP  and \nactivities  consistent  with \nsustainable  and  diverse,  market-oriented  microfinance  sector  with \nexpanded outreach of a wider range of services at competitive prices \nto the poor. \n \nImplementation  of  the  Program  could  be  affected  by  a  number  of \nfactors. The principal risk stems from resistance by vested interests to \nreforms,  including  measures  for  increased  transparency,  disclosure \nand  competition.  Such  resistance  can  be  overcome  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  and  the \ndevelopment of microfinance and microenterprises as embodied in the \nSocial Reform and  Poverty Alleviation Act and the MTDP 2004-2010. \nThere  may  also  be  delays  because  of  political  instability  or  social \nunrest, and lack of capacity to implement reforms in a timely manner.  \n \nThe MDP will provide significant benefits and will have positive impacts \non the poor. These include the following: \n \n(i)  a  deeper  financial  sector  that  fosters  broad-based,  economic \ngrowth,  reduces  poverty  and  contributes  to  macroeconomic \nstability;  \n\n(ii)  development  of  a  sustainable  and  diverse,  market-oriented \n\nmicrofinance sector with greater outreach to the poor;  \n\n(iii)  a  strengthened  regulatory  and  supervisory \n\nthat \ntransparency  and  disclosure,  and \n\nframework \n\npromotes  governance, \nincreased competition and soundness of MFIs; \n\n(iv)  lower cost of services to the poor and increased access to a wider \nrange of services in rural and remote areas, including savings and \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fremittance services; \n\n(v)  expansion  of  low-cost  cell  phone-based  technology  in  the  sector \nto  facilitate  remittance  flows  to  MFIs  and  payments  including  in \nremote areas; \n\n(vi)  mobilization  of  savings  in  MFIs\u2019  deposit  accounts  providing  a \nlower-cost source of funds for MFIs, in turn lowering cost of credit \nto the poor;  \n\n(vii)  improved  efficiency,  sustainability,  and  performance  of  service \ntraining,  adoption  of  uniform \n\nproviders \nperformance standards and standard chart of accounts; \n\nthrough  national \n\n(viii)  increased  financial  literacy  to  empower  the  poor,  and  consumer \nprotection  for  users  of  microfinance  services,  including  a  viable \nsystem  for  the  poor  to  make  inquiries  or  file  complaints  in  rural \nareas; and \n\n(ix)  reduced  vulnerability  of  the  poor  to  illegal  and unsound  practices \nas  new  products  and  services  are  introduced  in  an  expanding \nmarket. \n\n \nThe objective of the TA is to (i) promote financial literacy and help the \nGovernment develop a national financial literacy program for the poor \nand  users  of  microfinance  services;  (ii)  build  viable  MFIs  that  can \nprovide efficient and cost effective retail delivery of services to the poor \nand  (iii)  establish  a  consumer  protection  framework  to  reduce \nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  illegal  and  unsound  practices.  The  TA  is \nestimated  to  cost  $715,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \n(JSF),  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  and  the  Government  will \ncontribute $215,000 equivalent.   \n \nIn  parallel  with  the  preparation  of  the  MDP,  an  associated  project  is \nbeing  developed,  Developing  Financial  Cooperatives,  for  possible \nfinancing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  in  the \namount  of  $900,000,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Government  of \nJapan.  This  project  is  designed  to  develop  monitoring  and  regulatory \ncapacities  of  CDA,  and  provide  capacity  building  of  the  savings  and \ncredit  cooperatives  sector  over  2005\u20132008  for  efficient  and  sound \noperations and financial services to the poor.  \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance  \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Microfinance Development Program (MDP). The report \nalso describes technical assistance (TA) to support the implementation of MDP, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n \nSector Description and Performance  \nA. \n \n \nThe Macroeconomic Context. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Philippine country \n2. \npoverty analysis (CPA) for 2005 shows that the Philippines shares the common problem of low-\nincome countries \u2212 high poverty, despite its middle-income status. The overall poverty incident \nwas still high at 44.1% in 20031, though it had declined from 53.5% in 1991. The distribution of \nincome is highly inequitable. The lowest income quintile accounted for only 4.7% of total income \nin 2003, which was unchanged from 1991. Meanwhile, the highest income quintile accounted for \n53.4%  of  total  income  in  2003,  compared  to  53.9%  in  1991.  The  Gini  coefficient2  during  the \nsame period was unchanged at 0.47, with a narrow fluctuation between 0.45 in 1994 and 0.49 in \n1997. Though the Philippines experienced sustained GDP growth from 2000\u20132003, preliminary \n2003 Family Income and Expenditure Survey results indicate a 10% drop in real average family \nincomes.  Families  in  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  suffered  an  almost  20%  drop.  The \nsustained  economic  growth  during  this  period  had  not  been  pro-poor.  The  very  high  rural \npoverty  incidence  (47%  of  families  in  2000)  has  remained  unchanged  since  1988  (46.3%  of \nfamilies).  The  urban  poverty  incidence  fell  from  30.1%  of  families  in  1988  to  19.9%  in  2000. \nHowever,  the  absolute number  of  urban  poor  families  grew  by  11%  nationwide  between  1997 \nand 2000. There are seven regions where the number of urban poor families grew by more than \n20%. Rural poverty incidence is much more pronounced than urban poverty incidence, but the \nnumber of urban poor families is increasing. \n \nThe  second  quarter  2005  Social  Weather  Stations  survey3  reported  that  economic \n3. \nconditions  continue  to  be  harsh;  57%  of  household  heads regarded  their  households  as  poor, \nand 12% reported that their households experienced hunger at least once in the last 3 months. \nIn  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  2004\u20132010,  the  Government \nreported that poverty incidence worsened to 34% in 2000 from 33% in 1997 and the number of \npoor  individuals  increased  from  23.95  million  in  1997  to  26.54  million  in  2000.  With  the \npopulation growing at 2.36% per year and a projected annual addition of 1.6 million people, a \nheavy  burden  will  be  placed  on  the  social  and  physical  infrastructure  and  the  environment. \nWithout  corrective  action  to  rebalance  population  growth  against  the  limited  resources, \nprospects are limited for moving the 40% of Filipinos currently living on $2 or less a day out of \npoverty. Even with no change in the population, \u201caccess poverty\u201d is a major problem. Poverty is \nmanifested in low incomes and in exclusion, including poor access to services. Income poverty \nin the Philippines is a dynamic phenomenon with people moving in and out of poverty over time. \nA survey to gauge chronic and transient poverty found that over a 3-year period about one fifth \n                                                 \n1   Schelzig,  Karin.  2005.  Poverty  in  the  Philippines:  Income,  Assets,  and  Access.  Manila:  ADB.  Poverty  incident \n\ndefined as proportion of the population living on less than $2 per day. \n\n2  The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini and published in \n1912. It is usually used to measure income inequality, but can be used to measure any form of uneven distribution. \n3   Social  Weather  Stations  (SWS),  established  in  1985  as  a  private  non-stock,  nonprofit  social  research  institution, \n\nprovides survey-based social monitoring in the Philippines.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nof the surveyed households were chronically poor, whereas almost one third of the households \nmoved in and out of poverty over the period.4 \n \n4. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Microfinance.  The  CPA  highlights  seven  major  causes  of \npoverty:  (i)  weak  macroeconomic  management;  (ii) employment  issues;  (iii)  high  population \ngrowth rates; (iv) an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda; \n(v)  governance  issues  including  corruption  and  a  weak  state;  (vi)  conflict  and  security  issues, \nparticularly  in  Mindanao;  and  (vii) disability.  The  CPA  also  recognizes  that  poverty  is \nmultidimensional, and defines poverty as deprivation of five essential assets, or types of capital: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nhuman capital (education, good health, skills, and ability to work);  \nnatural capital (natural resource stocks such as land, forested areas, and clean \nair); \nphysical  capital  (basic  infrastructure  and  services  such  as  shelter,  transport, \nwater and sanitation, energy, and communications); \nfinancial capital (earned income, savings, remittances, access to credit); and \nsocial capital (social resources such as network of family, friends, and social and \ncommunity organizations). \n\n \n5. \nAccess to credit is a form of financial capital. Microfinance credit and services that help \nthe poor to receive remittances and build savings safely can also help them gain access to other \nfundamental assets such as education, good health, shelter, and communications. Studies from \na  number  of  countries  have  shown  that  the  rural  poor\u2019s  lack  of  access  to  product  and  factor \nmarkets leaves them largely bypassed by the growth process. Making markets work for the poor \nis therefore a key element of a country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.5 This supports the view that \nthe poor should be actively engaged in the growth process, as opposed to being left simply to \nshare in the benefits of growth (i.e., relying on the trickle-down effects of growth). Microfinance \ncan  help  the  poor  gain  access  to  product  and  factor  markets,  and  increase  employment  and \nincome-generating activities, thereby actively engaging them in the growth process.  \n \n6. \nSupply  and  Demand  of  Microfinance  Services.  Various  microfinance  services  are \nprovided in the Philippines by banks, cooperatives, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nincluding 184 banks6 (rural, thrift and cooperative banks), about 500 NGOs, and 4,579 savings \nand credit cooperatives. Many other types of registered cooperatives also provide some form of \nfinancial  services.  In  addition,  an  increasing  number  of  financial  institutions  are  engaging  in \nmicrofinance, while informal and unregulated institutions are moving toward formalization. MFI \nNGOs  have  played  an  important  role  in  providing  services  in  hard-to-reach  areas  where  the \nprivate sector has not entered and where there is less information on the markets and potential \nclients. The number of active borrowers from banks engaged in microfinance was reported by \nBSP  at  549,348  as  of  December  2004.  NAPC  reports  show  total  borrowers  at  2.1  million, \nincluding bank clients, as of June 2005 based on information reported by government financial \ninstitutions (GFIs) engaged in wholesale lending to microfinance institutions.  \n \n7. \nAlthough  the  Philippines  has  achieved  significant  progress  in  promoting  microfinance, \nmore  than  two-thirds  of  poor  households,  or  17  million  people,  still  do  not  have  access  to \nmicrofinance  services.7  Instead,  the  poor  rely  heavily  on  self-finance  or  informal  sources  that \n\n                                                 \n4  Footnote 1. \n5  Yao, Xianbin. 2003.

Based on average household size of six persons, and 4.3 million poor households. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nmay  be  very  costly,  limiting  their  ability  to  participate  in  and  benefit  from  development \nopportunities and income-generating activities. The limited outreach of microfinance services is \nreported in the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) 2004 report,  Status of Microfinance \nOutreach  in  60  Poorest  Provinces,  which  details  outreach,  potential  number  of  client \nhouseholds,  and  saturation  level  of  microfinance  services  in  each  area  (Supplementary \nAppendix A). Access to microfinance services can help the poor build viable businesses, pursue \neconomic  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities,  and  reduce  vulnerability  to  external \nshocks  or  contingencies.  Microfinance  is  the  central  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  in  the \nPhilippines  under  Republic  Act  8425  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act,  and  is  an \nimportant  part  of  the  MTDP  2004-2010.  However,  despite  Government  commitment  and \ndevelopment  of  the  sector  to  date,  further  measures  are  required  to  meet  popular  demand, \nachieve  Government\u2019s  goal  of  universal  access  originally  targeted  for  2005,  and  address \nsystemic weaknesses in the sector.  \n \n8. \n Microfinance  encompasses  a  range  of  services  including  savings  deposits,  loans, \npayment  services,  money  transfers,  remittances,  and  insurance.  Historically,  microfinance  has \nconcentrated on microcredit designed for high-turnover microenterprises. In practice, however, it \nhas been found that clients have adapted the loans for a variety of purposes such as medical \nexpenses,  funerals,  and  school  fees  in  addition  to  funding  livelihood  activities.  Microfinance  is \nalso  important  for  land  acquisition,  housing  construction,  purchase  of  animals,  consumer \ndurables  and  other  items.  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP)  regulations8  specify  that  the \nmaximum  principal  amount  of  a  microfinance  loan  shall  not  exceed  P150,000  and,  loans  are \noften  P4,000  and  below.  Interest  rates  in  the  market  are  high,  and  it  is  not  uncommon  to  see \nrates  of  60%  or  more  per  annum  even  before  additional  fees  and  deductions  are  taken  into \naccount.  These  high  rates  of  interest  could  be  reduced  through  competitive  pricing  and \nincreased  efficiencies  to  lower  cost  of  borrowing  to  the  poor.  The  clients  of  microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) are broadly the poor and low-income households and their microenterprises.9  \nMore than 90% of borrowers to date have been women. Who controls the funds once received, \nand how these are managed within the household unit, are areas for further examination. MFI \nclients  typically  lack  assets  for  collateral,  and  are  self-employed  in  the  informal  sector  or \nengaged  in  economic  livelihood  activities.  Loans  are  based  on  the  borrower  household's  net \ncash  flow  and  non-traditional  forms  of  security,  and  may  be  provided  to  either  groups  or \nindividuals.10  The microfinance sector as a whole has had very good repayment rates, and this \nis one of the attractive features of this market for financial institutions. The demand for savings \nservices is strong as or stronger than the demand for credit, and an expansion of the outreach \nof savings services will be essential for institutional sustainability and poverty reduction.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n9. \nThe Philippines National Strategy for Microfinance was prepared by the National Credit \nCouncil  (NCC),  an  inter-agency  body  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF).  The \n\nPolicy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks  \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\n                                                 \n8  BSP Circular 272, Guidelines Implementing the Provisions of Sections 40, 43 and 44 of the General Banking Act \n\n2000. Issued January 2001. \n\n9  A microenterprise as defined under BSP Circular No. 376 issued March 2003 is any business activity or enterprise \nwhose  total  assets,  inclusive  of  those  arising  from  loans  but  exclusive  of  the  land  on  which  the  business  entity\u2019s \noffice, plant and equipment are situated , has a value less than P3,000,000. In 2001, microenterprises accounted \nfor 91.7% of the total number of registered business firms in the Philippines and 38% of total employment.  \n\n10 Microfinance  lending  methodologies  include  the  Grameen  Bank  Approach  (group  lending)  and  Association  of \n\nSocial Advancement (ASA) Methodology (individual lending).  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nregulatory  framework  for  MFIs  also  formulated  by  NCC  covers  deposit-taking  institutions  that \nare  subject  to  prudential  regulation  and  supervision.  Under  existing  laws,  only  banks  and \ncooperatives  are  legally  authorized  to  accept  deposits.  Banks  can  accept  deposits  from  the \ngeneral public, and cooperatives can accept deposits from their members. The objective of the \nframework  is  to  provide  access  to  financial  services  in  a  liberalized  and  market-oriented \neconomy where the private sector plays a major role and the government provides the enabling \npolicy environment for efficient markets. The core principles of the strategy are: \n  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\na  greater  role  for  the  private  sector  in  the  provision  of  financial  services  to  the \npoor; \nan  enabling  policy  environment  that  will  facilitate  increased  participation  by  the \nprivate sector; \nadoption  of  market-oriented  financial  and  credit  policies  (e.g.  market-oriented \ninterest rates on loan and deposits); and \na phasing-out of government non-financial agencies and government-owned and \ncontrolled corporations in the implementation of credit programs  \n\n \nA  sustainable  microfinance  sector  is  a  core  principle  of  BSP  regulations11  for \n10. \nmicrofinance.  BSP  regulations  require  \u201cinterest  rates  to  be  not  lower  than  prevailing  market \nrates\u201d to enable MFIs to recover financial and operational costs. For many years, it was believed \nthat the poor were \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of microfinance who were unable to save, that those who did \nsave  preferred  non-financial  forms,  and  that  the  poor  could  not  afford  the  full  cost  of  credit  at \ncommercial  rates.  This  earlier  view  led  to  an  institutional  response  that  was  supply-led  and \nfocused  on  subsidized  credit  programs  by  governments  and  international  donor  agencies. \nPrivate  financial  institutions,  therefore,  developed  a  high  dependency  on  external  borrowings \nand  mobilization  of  savings  was  neglected.  However,  the  poor  are  now  viewed  as  bankable \n\u201cclients\u201d  with  high  loan  repayment  rates  and  increasing  savings,  and  provision  of  finance  is \nincreasingly demand-driven rather than supply-led. Microfinance is considered to be an integral \npart of a well-functioning financial sector that includes poor people in economic flows and offers \nopportunities that support the growth of local markets. \n \n11. \nThe  Philippine  Government  recognized  that  government-funded  credit  programs  were \ncostly, inefficient, unsustainable and left many poor still lacking access despite a proliferation of \nprograms.  Executive  Order  No.  138  issued  in  1999  called  for  an  end  to  subsidized,  directed \ncredit programs and the transfer of government-directed credit programs to financial institutions. \nCredit  subsidies  were  recognized  as  creating  market  distortions,  weakening  the  rural  banking \nsystem, and adding to the fiscal burden of the Government. DOF reported that as of end 2004, \nmost if not all of the direct credit programs have either been terminated or transferred to GFIs \nfor  continued  implementation.  Providing  subsidized  government  credit  programs  could  \u201ccrowd \nout\u201d  private,  sustainable  microfinance  services,  and  would  run  counter  to  the  NCC  policy \nframework for microfinance.    \n \n12. \nAlthough the Philippines is recognized for its microfinance sector, more than two-thirds \nof the 26 million poor, or 17 million people, have no access to it, and the country is still far from \nreaching its goal of providing access to microfinance services for all poor families. Recognizing \nthe  importance  of  new  entrants  and  of  increased  competition  in  the  microfinance  sector,  BSP \ndeclared  a  partial  moratorium  on  restrictions  to  allow  establishment  of  microfinance-oriented \n\n                                                 \n11 BSP Circular 272. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nbanks and microfinance lending windows for rural and thrift banks.12  A further relaxation of BSP \nregulations could facilitate more entry and competition. The definition/qualifications for banks to \nbe  considered  \u201cmicrofinance-oriented\u201d  is  limited,  and  restrictions  on  geographic  location  and \nfixed  percentages  of  gross  loan  portfolio  impede  the  expansion  of  sound  financial  institutions \nthat  could  provide  competitive,  efficient  microfinance  services.  Some  banks  have  also \nestablished  NGOs  in  order  to  expand  into  restricted  areas.  This  involves  additional  increased \ncost and administrative burden to the MFI and results in expansion of unregulated entities that \ncannot  provide  savings  services.  Increasing  expansion  of  deposit-taking  institutions  in \nmicrofinance is important not only to provide the savings services needed by the poor, but also \nto  build  the  resources  needed  for  sustainable  microfinance.  Although  opening  the  sector  for \nincreased competition may not entirely remove monopolistic pricing, the Consultative Group to \nAssist  the  Poor  (CGAP)  has  shown  that  increased  competition  can  reduce  the  pricing  of \nmicrofinance services, which is beneficial for the poor.  \n \n13. \nA  lack  of  standard  disclosure  practices  across  MFIs  on  total  costs  to  the  client  also \nimpedes  the  development  of  a  robust,  competitive  environment  for  microfinance.  Although  the \nbanks  have  established  truth-in-lending  guidelines  and  practices,  there  are  no  equivalent \nguidelines  for  cooperatives  or  NGO  MFIs.  This  means  that  clients  may  not  now  the  costs  of \nborrowing and cannot effectively compare total costs among various providers of microfinance. \nInterest rates can be expressed in a variety of ways that are not transparent and do not reveal \ntotal  costs.  Practices  vary  among  MFIs.  Interest  on  microfinance  loans,  which  is  usually  paid \nonce a week, can also be paid daily, monthly, or on another basis depending on the needs and \ncash  flow  capacities  of  clients.  Compulsory  deposits  or  compensatory  balances  and  other \ncharges and fees can also significantly increase the effective interest rate on funds borrowed. In \nthe  banking  sector,  in  2004  and  2005  BSP  required  banks  operating  in  microfinance  to  adopt \npractices  and  modify  truth  in  lending  forms  in  recognition  of  the  special  characteristics  of \nmicrofinance and the fact that many MFI clients may have limited financial education. However, \nthere are no established practices for the cooperative sector or NGO MFIs for truth-in-lending, \nand  the  majority  of  organizations  are  completely  unaware  of  the  Truth-in-Lending  Act  and \nrequirements for disclosure to protect borrowers. It is important that standard requirements for \ntruth in lending information and disclosure to microfinance clients are established for MFIs. \n \nThe tax regime for the microfinance sector is not specified, and there is a need for the \n14. \nBureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  to  develop  revenue  regulations  for  clarification  of  tax \ntreatment in the sector. Presently, there is not a consistent application or enforcement of tax for \nMFIs  within  a  particular  class  or  type.  Because  of  this  uncertainty,  there  is  confusion  in  the \nsector and some MFIs are deferring development plans pending resolution. Currently, there are \nincentives in the sector for MFIs to operate as NGOs, given the lack of restrictions on opening \nNGO branches, and as they pay no income or gross receipt tax. However, incentives for MFIs to \noperate as unregulated institutions (not authorized to accept deposits), promotes the expansion \nof  institutions  with  limited  sustainability.  This  ultimately  undermines  the  goal  of  achieving \nnationwide  sustainable  microfinance  services  for  the  poor.  The  need  to  commercialize \nmicrofinance in order to provide sustainable access to financial services is well recognized, and \nis  part  of  the  NCC  microfinance  policy.  The  profitability  of  microfinance  operations  has  been \ndemonstrated  in  the  Philippines,  and  it  is  important  to  examine  whether  at  this  stage  tax \nexemption  for  microfinance  is  needed  when  the  private  sector  can  profitably  operate  such \nbusiness.  In  view  of  the  current  fiscal  crisis  in  the  Philippines,  and  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing \n\n                                                 \n12 Circulars 340 (2002); 365 (2003); 369 (2003). BSP Circulars providing rules and regulations for the establishment \nof  branches  and/or  loan  collection  and  disbursement  points  of  microfinance-oriented  banks  and  microfinance  \u2013\noriented branches of regular banks.   \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRegulatory and Supervisory Authorities \n\nreview  of  tax  policy  and  revenue  measures,  an  examination  of  tax  policy  for  the  microfinance \nsector  should  be  undertaken  to  specify  tax  treatment  of  microfinance  transactions.  Any \nintroduction  of  taxes  could  be  phased  in  over  a  designated  period  to  provide  a  smooth \ntransition,  and  if  there  remains  a  need  to  provide  tax  incentives  to  MFIs  to  operate  in  remote \nareas, tax incentives could be offered for those designated areas to all types of MFIs for a fair, \ncompetitive, and robust market. \n  \n \n \n15. \nThere is no single regulatory authority for entities providing microfinance services. Thrift \nbanks and rural banks are supervised by BSP; credit cooperatives are under the supervision of \nthe  Cooperative  Development  Authority  (CDA);  and  microfinance  NGOs  are  not  regulated  or \nsupervised by any government agency. With no single authority, there have been both uneven \nstandards  and  fragmented  supervision  and  regulation  across  MFIs.  The  following  summarizes \nregulatory and monitoring frameworks for banks, cooperatives and MFI NGOs.  \n \nBangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP).  BSP  is  the  regulatory  authority  for  all  banking \n16. \ninstitutions  including  those  engaged  in  microfinance.  BSP  recognizes  microfinance-oriented \nbanks  that  are  licensed,  such  as  normal  thrift  or  rural  banks  with  additional  requirements  for \nmicrofinance.  BSP  circulars13  issued  in  2003  prescribe  detailed  reporting  on  microfinance \noperations  and  provide  a  formal  minimum  credit  risk  management  guidelines,  including  the \nmeasurement of portfolio-at-risk and provisioning standards. As part of its regulatory mandate, \nBSP supervises and conducts regular examinations of banks. Examiners check for compliance \nwith  banking  laws,  rules  and  regulations;  soundness  of  systems  for  evaluating  credit; \nsupervision  and  collection  of  loans;  and  the  quality  of  the  loan  portfolio.  Recognizing  that \nmicrofinance  operations  have  special  characteristics,  in  2005  BSP  will  adopt  a  manual  for  the \nsupervision  and  examination  of  banks  engaged  in  microfinance  operations.  Section  40  of  the \nGeneral Banking Act of 2000 recognized the special characteristics of microfinance and directed \nthe Monetary Board to issue measures for microfinance. In that regard, BSP has issued a series \nof  circulars  to  address  microfinance  operations  and  practices,  and  has  reviewed  its  existing \nregulatory,  supervisory  and  examination  procedures  and  guidelines.  More  detailed  information \non  microfinance  operations  and  performance  by  thrift  and  rural  banks  will  be  important  for \nassessing the sector. In addition, data need to be made more accessible on the BSP website, \nwhich currently provides limited information on microfinance. \n \n17. \nCooperative  Development  Authority  (CDA).  Established  in  1990,  the  CDA  is \nmandated  under  the  Cooperative  Development  Authority  Republic  Act  No.  6939  (RA  6939)  to \nprovide  oversight  functions  for  all  types  of  cooperatives14  including  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives.  CDA  extension  offices  are  located  in  the  cities  of  Dagupan,  Naga,  Iloilo,  Cebu, \nCagayan  de  Oro,  and  Davao  (Supplementary  Appendix  B).  Credit  cooperatives  can  mobilize \nmillions  of  pesos  of  deposits  from  members  who  are  largely  from  low  and  middle-income \ngroups.  In  2003,  CDA  reported  savings  of  P6.9  billion  and  capital  build-up  and  P3.5  billion  in \n7,840  cooperatives.  Some  cooperatives  are  even  larger  than  some  rural  and  thrift  banks,  and \nthere  is  a  need  to  institute  prudential  norms  and  oversight  measures  to  protect  cooperative \nmembers\u2019 deposits. The total number of registered cooperatives in the Philippines reported for \n2003  is  64,998,  although  the  number  of  operating  cooperatives  was  only  31,191.  The  large \n\n                                                 \n13 Circulars including 409 (2003). \n14 Cooperatives  are  associations  organized  for  the  economic  and  social  betterment  of  their  members,  operating \nbusiness  enterprises  based  on  mutual  aid  and  founded  upon  internationally  accepted  cooperative  principles  and \npractices. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nalthough the number of operating cooperatives is only 31,191. The large percentage of inactive \nor failed cooperatives reflects the limited regulatory capacity and authority, among other factors. \n \n18. \n CDA  registers  cooperatives  and  their  federations  and  unions,  and  requires  all \nregistrants to submit annual audited financial statements and general information sheets. CDA \ndoes not, however, supervise or examine the books of credit cooperatives, and lacks the data \nand management information systems to oversee them effectively. Data are not centralized at \nCDA  headquarters  or  readily  available  to  CDA  officers  in  Manila,  which  significantly  reduce \nCDA\u2019s  oversight  capacity.  Although  CDA  has  the  power  to  cancel  the  registration  of \ncooperatives  for  non-compliance  with  administrative  requirements,  it  has  not  issued  prudential \nrules  and  regulations  for  safe  and  sound  operation  of  cooperatives  in  savings  and  credit \nactivities. CDA has historically concentrated on development and promotion of cooperatives and \ntheir products and services, and regulation has been weak because of the conflicting mandates \nof  regulation  and  development,  insufficient  regulatory  power,  and  lack  of  uniform  and \ntransparent information on cooperatives. CDA was transferred from the Office of the President \nto  the  DOF  in  2004  to  strengthen  its  regulatory  and  oversight  functions  and  to  facilitate \ncoordination  of  policies  and  programs  between  DOF  and  CDA.  Amendments  to  RA  6939  and \nthe  Cooperative  Code  of  the  Philippines  (RA  6938)  were  prepared  by  CDA  and  submitted  to \nCongress in 2004. The reorganization of CDA is necessary for providing more focused oversight \nfor savings and credit cooperatives. \n \n19. \nCooperatives are a major MFI in the Philippines. Most of the 4,500 credit cooperatives \nand  many  of  the  over  18,000  other  cooperatives  provide  microfinance  services  to  their  poor \nmembers. For a sound microfinance operation by the cooperative sector, CDA, in collaboration \nwith NCC, has developed a standard chart of accounts (SCA) and performance standards to be \napplied  to  credit  and  other  types  of  cooperatives  engaged  in  savings  and  credit  services.  The \nremaining  challenge  is  to  see  these  performance  standards  fully  implemented  by  all  financial \ncooperatives.  This  will  need  capacity  building  of  cooperatives  through  training  on  credit  risk \nmanagement,  accounting,  asset-liability  management,  corporate  governance,  and  other \nsubjects related to sound financial service operations. CDA is currently standardizing a training \nmodule  on  cooperative  operations  of  credit  and  savings  services.  Training  sessions  based  on \nthe  standard  curriculum  should  be  conducted  at  financial  cooperatives  by  cooperative \nassociations  and  unions  accredited  by  CDA.  There  should  also  be  training  in  the  SCA  and \nperformance standards developed by CDA for cooperatives engaged in financial services. Over \n2,500  cooperatives  are  registered  every  year.  However,  the  current  CDA  registration  system \nrequires  manual  reconciliation  and  verification.  Moreover,  only  15%  of  68,000  registered \ncooperatives  (only  about  28,000  of  which  are  active)  submit  annual  operational  and  financial \nstatus  accounts.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  modernize  the  CDA  registration  system  and \nimprove cooperatives\u2019 compliance with CDA requirements. \n \nSecurities  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  All  NGOs,  including  those  providing \n20. \nmicrofinance, register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as non-stock, non-\nprofit  organizations,  and  are  required  to  file  annual  audited  financial  reports  and  general \ninformation sheets. Considered to be non-deposit-taking institutions, MFI NGOs are not subject \nto  prudential  regulation  and  supervision  by  any  government  regulatory  authority.  In  practice, \nNGO  MFIs  do  take  \u201ccompulsory\u201d  deposits  (also  known  as  capital  build  up  and  compensatory \nbalances)  from  borrower-clients.  Under  the  General  Banking  Act,  only  registered  banking \ninstitutions  are  allowed  to  accept  deposits  from  the  general  public.  However,  BSP  has  been \ntaking a tolerant view of this practice as long as total deposits of the MFI NGO do not exceed \ntotal  outstanding  loan  balances.  MFI  NGOs  that  collect  savings  beyond  the  compensating \nbalance  are  encouraged  to  transform  themselves  into  formal,  regulated  financial  institutions \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n(credit cooperatives or rural or thrift banks). However, there are also concerns that some MFIs \nare illegally accepting individual voluntary deposits. With no effective monitoring mechanism in \nplace for monitoring this activity, it is difficult to assess these concerns fully. As these \u201cdeposit-\ntaking\u201d activities involve prudential issues that require regulation, there is a need to resolve this \nmatter.  At  best,  MFI  NGOs  file  only  annual  statements,  and  as  can  be  seen  in  the  sample  of \nSEC documents referenced below, even these reports are not current for many institutions.  An \neffective  information  reporting  system  needs  to  be  established  if  BSP  is  to  oversee  voluntary \ndeposit-taking properly.     \n \n21. \nThere  is  a  general  lack  of  data  for  MFI  NGOs,  and  the  lack  of  a  current,  uniform,  and \ntransparent set of data for MFI NGOs is a significant issue. The majority of MFI NGOs do not \nuse the term \u201cmicrofinance\u201d to identify their business when registering with SEC, and therefore \nSEC  is  not  able  to  completely  identify  NGOs  that  operate  as  MFIs.  Common  business \ndescriptions  such  as  \u201csocial  development\u201d  or  \u201cfacilitating  access  to  economic  development \nactivities\u201d  are  often  used.  Although  these  are  also  indicative  of  NGO  efforts,  the  failure  to \ndisclose that an NGO is conducting microfinance lending operations prevents proper oversight \nand governance. A review of the latest filed SEC documents for 15 larger NGO MFIs found that, \nas of 15 May 2005, for 3 their most recent report was 2004, for 7 it was 2003, and for 5 it was \n2002.  All  of  the  15  NGOs  were  members  of  the  Microfinance  Council  of  the  Philippines,  Inc. \n(MCPI),  but  only  a  few  included  microfinance  as  a  stated  business  activity  in  their  articles  of \nincorporation.  A  few  others  stated  that  they  \u201cfacilitated\u201d  financial  services  but  did  not  indicate \nthat  they  directly  \u201cprovided\u201d  financial  services,  although  they  were  known  to  be  providers  of \nmicrofinance  loans.  Disclosure  in  annual  information  sheets  is  similarly  lacking.  One  NGO \namended  its  articles  of  incorporation  to  eliminate  \u201cmicrofinance\u201d  from  the  name  of  the  NGO, \nalthough it continued to provide microfinance services and to be a member of the MCPI.   \n \n22. \nTo  facilitate  proper  oversight  and  transparency,  articles  of  incorporation  should  be \namended  to  include  microfinance  as  an  authorized  activity  if  NGOs  provide  such  services.    In \naddition,  the  annual  information  sheets,  which  are  in  summary  form,  could  be  modified  to \ninclude a box to be checked if microfinance activities are being conducted. This would facilitate \nreview  by  SEC  and  other  authorities.  MCPI  tracks  the  performance  of  its  members,  although \nthis  information  has  been  limited  because  submission  is  voluntary,  and  data  is  published  10 \nmonths after year-end. However, there is potential for MCPI to play a stronger role as a center \nfor  broader  data  collection  on  MFIs  beyond  its  membership.  MCPI,  established  in  1997,  is  a \nnetwork  of  34  institutions  (26  practitioners,  mostly  NGOs,  and  8  service  providers)  working \ntowards the rapid development of the microfinance industry.15 Membership requirements include \n(i) a mission statement with a vision for the poor; (ii) a minimum of 3,000 clients; (iii) a minimum \nloan  portfolio  of  Php10  million;  (iv)  a  three-year  track  record;  (v)  an  operations  manual  and \nmanagement information system (MIS); and (vii) SEC documents. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Capacity and Efficiency of MFIs \n\n \n23. \nLimited competition in the microfinance sector has resulted in weak incentives for MFIs \nto  build capacity,  improve  efficiencies,  or  lower  the  cost  of services  to clients.  It  is known  that \nmicrofinance clients in the Philippines can and do pay high rates for borrowing, and that access \nis  more  important  to  the  poor  than  cost.  MFI  rates  are  higher  than  those  of  other  commercial \nlenders  because  of  the  high  transaction  and  operating  costs  for  lending  and  collecting  (e.g., \n\n                                                 \n15 As  of  31  December  2003,  21  members  had  a  total  gross  loan  portfolio  of  P2,334,494,701  and  578,493  active \nborrowers,  indicting  an  average  loan  amount  of  P4,035  per  client.  MCPI.  2003  Performance  Monitoring  Report. \nManila. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ndaily or weekly collection visits in often difficult to reach locations). Some of these costs are due \nto  poor  physical  infrastructure  (such  as  roads)  in  rural  areas  and  the  need  for  frequent  client \nvisits. However some operating costs could be reduced through efficiencies. The fact that MFI \nclients have been noted to value access over cost should not be used as an excuse to justify \nany price, or to ignore the potential for greater outreach through competitive pricing. \n \n24. \nThe  development  and  adoption  of  sound  performance  standards,  SCA,  and  disclosure \nand  reporting  practices  will  help  ensure  that  MFIs  are  viable  and  sustainable  allow  the \nperformance  of  different  types  of  MFIs  to  be  compared  and  evaluated,  which  is  difficult  under \nthe  current  fragmented  regulatory  framework.  For  the  MFI  NGOs,  MCPI  has  adopted \nperformance standards and formulated a SCA, although these have not been widely adopted. \nThe  chart  of  accounts  is  being  reviewed  to  make  it  comparable  with  those  for  other  types  of \nMFIs. For credit cooperatives and other cooperatives offering savings and credit services, CDA \nhas  developed  a  chart  of  accounts  and  performance  standards.16  It  has  issued  circulars17 \nrequiring  adoption  of  the  SCA  and  performance  standards,  and  a  transitional  period  of  1  year \nwas  allowed  to  enable  implementation  by  2004.  Although  there  has  been  some  progress,  the \nmajority of cooperatives have not yet adopted the chart of accounts or performance standards, \nand capacity building will be important if they are to be implemented effectively. In recognition of \nthe  need  for  common  standards,  NCC  and  a  technical  working  group  composed  of \nrepresentatives from microfinance practitioners and other stakeholders reviewed the existing set \nof performance standards and formulated a common set to be applied across all types of MFIs.  \nNCC announced the common standards in November 2004, and MFI NGOs, cooperatives and \nbanks with microfinance operations will move towards adopting these standards.   \n \nThe institutional capacity of MFIs is a significant constraint on increasing their size and \n25. \nenabling sustainable outreach to the poor.18  Major capacity building is needed if management \nis to gain the skills needed. Currently, many MFIs lack basic skills for sustainable, effective, and \nefficient  delivery  of  microfinance  services  to  the  poor.  Inefficiencies  lead  to  higher  operating \ncosts  and  to  unnecessarily  high  interest  rates  for  the  poor.  Skills  need  to  be  developed  in \n(i) management, (ii) financial reporting and disclosure, (iii) credit and cash flow analysis, (iv) risk \nmanagement,  (v) performance  monitoring  systems  and  standards  for  MFIs,  and  (vi) best \npractices for sustainable microfinance. Donor assistance, including ADB TA, is helping to build \nMFI  capacity  and  increase  social  mobilization.19  Longer  term  support  for  the  rapidly  growing \nmicrofinance  industry  would  benefit  from  university  and  training  institute  programs  and  the \nconsolidation of current training programs and materials in a free national archive.  \n \nA  credit  information  bureau  (CIB)  including  microfinance  is  important  infrastructure  to \n26. \nincrease financial transparency and promote a more efficient microfinance sector. In the current \nenvironment where there is a lack of credit information, many MFIs are reluctant to lend above \nP50,000. There is a gap in supply of loans in the range from P50,000 to P150,000 (maximum \nallowed), not due to a lack of available funds but to institutions\u2019 desire to diversify their portfolios \nand lower their risk. Better credit information could assist MFIs with risk management and help \nto  improve  the  provision  of  microfinance  to  clients.  With  a  rapidly  expanding  microfinance \n\n                                                 \n16 Technical assistance support was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n17 The  CDA  \u201cCOOP-PESOS\u201d  standards  include  administrative  and  performance  standards  for    (i)  portfolio  quality, \n\n(ii) efficiency, (iii) stability, (iv) operations, and (v) structure of assets. \n\n18 Fernando,  Nimal.  2004.

The MDP \nwill  support the  establishment  of  a  central  CIB,  including coverage  of  microfinance,  to  replace \nthe existing system of fragmented credit bureaus. A private nationwide credit bureau has been \nin place at the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) since 1990. However, this system \nis limited to negative-file information only, and is accessible only to commercial banks. 20 \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Literacy, Gender Education, and Consumer Protection \n\n \n27. \nGreater financial literacy among potential microfinance clients is needed to (i) introduce \nthe  poor  to  a  formal  or  semiformal,  market-oriented  institutional  environment,  (ii)  promote \neffective access and utilization of microfinance services, and (iii) ensure adequate knowledge of \nrights and obligations of microfinance clients. A national program for financial literacy is needed \nto  achieve  the  nationwide  expansion  of  microfinance  envisioned  in  the  Philippines.  The \nGovernment also recognizes the importance of educating women on their financial rights within \nfamilies. Although most borrowers from MFIs are women, concerns remain about management \nof  funds  once  they  are  within  the  family  unit.  In  addition,  single  women  are  not  approved  for \nloans under some lending methods, unless they can prove that they are head of the household. \nThis  type  of  bias,  and  impact  on  women\u2019s  development  needs  to  be  addressed.  Significant \nresources  will  be  needed  for  a  comprehensive  national  program.  NAPC,  through  the  Joining \nArms  Together  Against  Poverty  (KALAHI)21  network,  and  in  coordination  with  concerned \nagencies,  can  provide  an  organizational  framework  for  a  sustainable  national  program. \nIncreasing financial literacy is essential if the poor are to be helped to obtain access to financial \nservices,  and  be  protected  from  false  and  misleading  or  illegal  practices.  Such  a  program \nshould include information on the Truth in Lending Act and required disclosure forms, and other \nlaws and regulations applicable to microfinance services and products. Insurance is a particular \narea of concern, as the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) has discovered \nthat  some  MFIs  are  forcing  the  poor  to  purchase  insurance  policies  in  order  to  access \nmicrofinance  services,  and  selling  insurance  without  proper  license,  authority,  or  actuarial \nvaluation/reserves  to  ensure  payment  of  obligations.  The  poor  need  access  to  insurance \nservices in a safe and sound system and in accordance with the law.      \n \nTo strengthen consumer protection for the poor and users of microfinance, relevant laws \n28. \nand  regulations  need  to  be  reviewed  to  ensure  consumer  protection  for  the  poor  and \nmicrofinance  sector,  including  adequate  systems  for  addressing  consumer  complaints.  To \nfacilitate  a  system  that  is  friendly  and  practical  to  the  poor  and  to  those  in  rural  areas,  an \naffordable  system  for  making  inquiries,  filing  complaints,  and  mediation  in  rural  and  provincial \nareas  should  be  established.  NAPC,  in  coordination  with  the  relevant  agencies,  could  lead \ndevelopment of a national system to effectively encompass the poor and disadvantaged groups. \nEstablishment of a compliance officer in each MFI responsible for compliance of applicable laws \nand regulations is important to ensure sound operations, and to protect the poor and users of \nmicrofinance services from illegal and unsound practices. Designation of an officer in the MFI to \nbe the compliance officer will not raise the operating overhead costs of the MFI, but will ensure \nsound and sustainable operations.    \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Source: Bankers Association of the Philippines. \n21 Pursuant  to  Memorandum  Circular  No.  33  Institutionalizing  Kapit  Bisig  Laban  sa  Kahirapan  (KALAHI)  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s Program for Poverty Reduction issued November 2002, the Government through KALAHI, will solicit \nactive participation of basic sector organizations, other society organizations, and the business sector in its poverty \nreduction programs or activities. This multistakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC \npoverty reduction initiatives.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n5. \n\nSavings Mobilization, Remittances, and New Technologies  \n\n \n29.  Mobilization of savings is essential for sustainable national microfinance. Historically, the \ndependence of MFIs on subsidized credits from the Government, donors, and lending agencies \nled  to  weak  savings  mobilization.  As  MFI\u2019s  savings  deposits  increase,  so  does  the  pool  of \nresources  for  MFIs  to  improve  services  and  expand  outreach.  The  NCC  strategy  for \nmicrofinance  has  turned  away  from  promotion  of  subsidized  credits  towards  mobilization  of \nsavings  deposits.  Allowing  banks  to  expand  and  open  branches  will  help  to  mobilize  savings. \nOne  potential  source  for  rapid  mobilization  of  savings  in  the  Philippines  is  remittances  from \noverseas  Filipino  workers  (OFWs).  Money  transfers  and  remittance  services  are  important  to \nmany poor, although many have no access to such services through formal channels. Instead \nthey rely on informal channels such as physical transportation of cash across borders and other \nmethods. BSP reported $8.6 billion in overseas Filipino workers remittances to the Philippines \nthrough formal channels in 2004. An equal, or even greater amount, is considered by some to \nbe  channeled  through  informal  channels  into  the  Philippines.  If  MFIs  could  capture  5%  of  the \ninformal  remittance  flows,  this  would  translate  into  $430  million.  Capturing  15%  of  informal \nremittance flows would translate into $1.29 billion. A large portion of such remittances would go \nto  a  variety  of  household  and  family  expenditures,  but  the  remainder  could  remain  in  an  MFI \ndeposit account rather than at home or at a neighbor\u2019s for safekeeping. \n \n\nTable 1: Potential Savings Mobilization through Remittancesa \n($ millions) \n \n\n \nPercentage of \nremittances retained \nas savings \n(%) \n\nProjected percentage of informal \nremittance flows captured by  \nmicrofinance institutions \n($) \n10%=$860 \nmillion \n\n5%=$430 \nmillion \n\n15%=$1,290 \nmillion \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n21.5  \n\n43.0 \n\n43.0 \n\n86.0 \n\n15 \n\n129.0 \na Assumes estimated $8.6 billion in informal remittance flows. \nSource:  ADB estimates. \n\n64.5 \n\n64.5 \n\n129.0 \n\n193.5 \n\n \n \nTo facilitate the depositing of remittances directly into the accounts of regulated deposit-\n30. \ntaking MFIs (rural banks, thrift banks, credit and savings cooperatives), a regulatory framework \nis  needed.  Enabling  these  sectors  to  capture  informal  remittance  flows,  could  significantly \nincrease  MFI  savings  deposits  and  provide  a  vital  service  to  the  poor.  It  could  accelerate  the \nexpansion  and  outreach  of  sustainable  microfinance  and  lower  the  cost  of  loans  to  the  poor. \nThe cost of funds raised through savings mobilization is significantly lower that the cost of funds \nprovided  to  MFIs  by  government  financial  institutions  for  onlending.  Not  only  does  savings \nmobilization  provide  resources  for  sustainable  national  outreach  of  microfinance  services\u2014it \nultimately lowers the cost of credit to the poor. \n \n31. \nNew cell-phone-based technologies can also significantly lower the cost of remittances \nand  money  transfers  into  deposit  accounts.  The  Philippines  is  the  international  leader  in  this \narea, and is rapidly adapting products and services to meet the needs of OFWs and the public. \nRegulations are needed to support the transfer of remittances into deposit accounts of regulated \nMFIs  using  cell-phone-based  technology.  Clear  rules  are  needed  for  MFIs  to  be  approved  as \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nremittance centers. Specific regulations are needed for centers that receive remittances only in \npesos  (and  therefore  do  not  need  a  foreign  exchange  facility).  The  Philippines  is  in  a  unique \nposition  to  establish  best  practice  guidelines  and  regulations  for  cell  phone  technology  that \ncould provide a global model. \n \n32. \nAn  estimated  43%  of  Filipinos,  or  36  million  people,  use  cellular  phones  and  the \npenetration rate is expected to increase by year-end 2005. A used cell phone can be purchased \nfor as low as P500, and a SIM card/phone number can be purchased for around P200\u2013P300, \nenabling cell phone access to many persons. Entrepreneurs with cell phones are also providing \npayment  services  to  persons  without  cell  phones  or  living  in  remote  areas  without  cellular \nservice. This is an important service for microentrepreneurs living in remote areas who can not \nafford the time to personally visit an MFI to make loan payments, but have the capacity to repay. \nPayment by cell phone could result in a savings of 6\u20138 hours that could be used for productive \nwork in the microenterprise or livelihood activity. One service provider\u2019s tie-up arrangement with \nthe  Rural  Bankers  Association  of  the  Philippines  (RBAP)  and  the  Microenterprise  Access  to \nBanking Services Program (MABS),22 helps to facilitate disbursement and collection of loans via \ncell phone. The National Confederation of Cooperatives, Inc. (NATCCO) has also aligned with a \nservice  provider  to  enhance  loan  services  and  implement  livelihood  programs  for  member \ncooperatives. The outreach opportunities for transfer and payment services are great, and the \ndevelopments underway for an alliance among major mobile operators in the Asia-Pacific that \nwill  support  regional  mobile  infrastructure  for  a  common  service  platform  that  will  allow \nseamless cross-border services.23 Remittances via cell phones are expected to gain significant \nmarket share especially in rural areas with weak financial infrastructure.            \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nfor \n\n \n33. \nSignificant external assistance has been provided by funding agencies and donors to the \nPhilippines  for  the  microfinance  sector.  ADB  assistance  will  complement  this  assistance,  and \nbuild  upon  sector  developments  and  progress  to  date.  ADB  will  continue  coordination  with \nagencies during the implementation of the MDP to ensure effective allocation of resources and \ncoordination  among  agencies  active  in  this  sector.  Sector  projects  include  the  United  States \nAgency \nInternational  Development  (USAID)-funded  programs\u23afMABS,  Credit  Policy \nImprovement Program (CPIP), and the Credit Union Empowerment and Strengthening Program \nII  (CUES-II).  The  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise  Program  provides  capacity  building  for  financial  institutions  and  a  training  program \nfor  SME  lending  for  privately  owned  rural  banks,  and  thrift  banks  in  the  Visayas  region.  The \nMicrofinance Sector Strengthening Project (MSSP) funded by the United Nations Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID) \nprovides  technical  assistance  including  training  to  MFIs  on  the  ASA  methodology  of  individual \nlending,  and  documents  successful  practices  and  case  studies  of  MFIs.  The  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  has  conducted  a  pilot  study  on  sustainable  microfinance  for \npoverty reduction, and assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) \nincludes access to the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives and the Private Enterprise Accelerated \nResource Linkages (PEARL) Project. Agencies providing credit facilities for onlending to micro, \nsmall  and medium  enterprises  include  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD); \nKfW,  and  the  World  Bank.  Additional  information  on  these  projects  and  planned  assistance  is \nprovided in the Development Coordination Matrix (see Appendix 6). \n\n                                                 \n22 Supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n23 Announcement  in  July  2005  of  alliance  of  eight  mobile  operators  including  Bridge  Mobile  (which  includes  Globe \n\nTelecom) for development of regional mobile infrastructure. \n\n\f13\n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nThe  Philippines\u2019  country  assistance  program  evaluation  (CAPE)24  noted  that  ADB  can \n34. \nplay a pivotal role in helping the Philippines to reduce poverty and promote social development, \nand  that  ADB\u2019s  future  lending  operations  can  focus  on  such  areas  as  microcredit  to  support \nincome-generating  activities  of  the  poor.  It  was  also  noted  that  emphasis  should  be  on \nsustainability rather than the speed of implementation of reforms, recognizing the limitations that \ncan arise from stakeholder consultation and democratic process. The CAPE included two NGO \nmicrocredit  projects25  approved  in  1988  and  1991,  and  noted  the  success  of  the  projects  in \ncreating  income-generating  activities  of  the  poor.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in microcredit  lending  has \nheightened staff awareness of a number of important project design features. Reaching the very \npoor,  particularly  in  the  Philippine  context,  requires  a  high  degree  of  social  preparation  of \ntargeted  beneficiaries  who  are  identified  by  a  means  test.  Microenterprises,  like  any  other \nbusiness, need continuous access to reasonably priced credit for sustainability and expansion. \nThe  Rural  Microenterprise  Finance  Project,26  approved  in  1996,  was  based  on  findings  of  a \nnumber  of  evaluations  of  microcredit  programs  that  showed:  (i)  subsidized  loans  provided  to \nend-borrowers  at  below  market  rates  encouraged  corruption  and  often  reached  the  local  elite \nrather  than  target  groups  of  lower-income  borrowers;  (ii)  credit  subsidies  provided  at  the  local \nlevel  frequently  discouraged  institutional  savings  mobilization;  (iii)  where  microcredit  had  been \nprovided  by  institutions  at  commercial  interest  rates,  and  where  local  savings  have  been \nmobilized, loans tended to be widely available and repayment rates high; and (iv) when credit \nsubsidies  were  replaced  by  commercial  microfinance,  there  could  be  substantial  savings  to \ngovernments and funding sources. Lessons learned27 from ADB\u2019s microfinance operations are \nsimilar to those learned by other funding agencies and those reported in the CGAP guidelines \nand papers. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe financial system approach is the key to achieving sustainable results and to \nmaximizing  development  impact.  This  approach  emphasizes  an  enabling  policy \nenvironment,  financial  infrastructure,  and  financial  intermediaries  that  are \ncommitted  to  achieving  financial  viability  and  sustainability  within  a  reasonable \nperiod and that can provide a variety of financial services, not just credit, to the \npoor. \n\nMicrofinance  clients  are  more  concerned  about  access  to  services  that  are \ncompatible with their requirements than about the cost of services, and, given the \ndiversity of demand for financial services, a broad range of institutional types is \nrequired. \n\nStrong retail institutions committed to outreach and sustainability are essential for \npermanently  extending  the  reach  of  financial  services  and  having  a  significant \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction.  Financial  institutions  committed  to  providing \nmicrofinance services in most developing member countries require considerable \nTA for capacity building. \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

Expanding the outreach of savings \nservices  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  both  institutional  sustainability  and \npoverty reduction. \n\nBecause  microfinance  is  primarily  targeted  at  the  poor  who  are  disadvantaged, \nsocial  mobilization  is  necessary  to  introduce  them  to  a  formal  or  semi-formal, \nmarket-oriented institutional environment.   \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nA.  \n \n35. \nThe goal of the MDP is to assist Government to reduce poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth. The MDP supports the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of eradicating \nextreme poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality and empowering women. The MDP will \ncontribute to these goals by achieving its objective of ensuring permanent access to sustainable \ninstitutional  financial  services  for  a  majority  of  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their \nmicroenterprises  at  competitive  prices.  A  national  financial  literacy  program,  including  gender \ntraining  and  consumer  protection,  will  empower  the  poor  and  promote  effective  access  and \nutilization of microfinance services. MDP will assist the Government to build viable MFIs , and \nimprove  the  performance  of  the  microfinance  sector,  including  reducing  transaction  costs \nassociated with delivery of financial services and thereby increase sustained access to financial \nservices by the poor. The poor will have opportunities to increase incomes and employment and \nimprove  their  quality  of  life  through  access  to  sustainable  and  more  responsive  microfinance \nservices  including  money  transfer  and  remittance  services  that  support  investment  and \nproduction.28  A Design and Monitoring Framework is included in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  \n \n36. \nThe  policy  framework  and  actions  that  have  been  agreed  with  the  Government  are \ndescribed in the development policy letter and the attached policy matrix in Appendix 3. The key \nmeasures are summarized as follows. \n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nEnhance \nthe  Enabling  and  Regulatory  Environment  and  Remove \nImpediments  and  Policy  Distortions  to  Promote  Market \nRegulatory \nEfficiencies  and  Increased  Outreach  of  Services  at  Competitive  Prices  to \nthe Poor  \n\n \nThe  Program  will  support  development  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  a  sustainable \n37.  \nmicrofinance,  and  remove  regulatory  restrictions  on  competition  and  the  expansion  of  sound \nMFIs. BSP regulations will be issued providing greater flexibility in bank branching for financially \nsound  and  well-managed  banks,  including  those  catering  to  the  micro,  small  and  medium \nenterprises. Disclosure and transparency will be increased in the sector, and truth-in-lending will \nbe  introduced  to  all  types  of  MFIs  to  ensure  that  costs  of  borrowing  are  fully  disclosed  to  the \npoor. Disclosure practices will be strengthened and standardized so that costs of borrowing can \nbe effectively compared across all types of MFIs. Revenue regulations will be issued specifying \n\n                                                 \n28 In  connection  with  the  MDP,  should  a  need  arise  in  the  future,  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  facility  may  be \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nthe tax treatment of microfinance transactions, and clarifying the tax regime for MFIs and other \nentities  engaged  in  microfinance,  for  consistent  enforcement.  To  facilitate  remittance  flows  to \nthe  Philippines,  including  to  MFIs  in  remote  areas,  and  to  lower  the  cost  of  transfer  of \nremittances from OFWs, rules and regulations will be issued to support application of cell phone \nbased  technology  for  low  cost  transfers  and  payments.  This  will  encompass  regulations  for  e-\nbanking transactions including e-payment transactions and e-value transfers made through non-\nbank  institutions  including,  but  not  limited  to,  peer-to-peer  transfers,  remittances,  small  value \ntransfers  and  stored  value  transfers.  The  Program  will  promote  the  mobilization  of  savings  in \nMFIs  through  facilitation  of  direct  deposit  of  remittances  into  MFI  accounts.  The  savings \nmobilization will provide a lower-cost source of funds for MFIs, which in turn will lower the cost \nof credit to the poor. Savings mobilization is also essential to provide the resources necessary \nfor  increased  outreach  and  sustainable  microfinance  services.  The  Program  will  support  the \nestablishment  of  an  accurate,  reliable  and  transparent  set  of  data  for  all  types  of  MFIs,  and \ndevelopment  of  a  free  national  sector  database  in  NAPC.  To  increase  transparency  and \ndisclosure  of  MFI  NGOs,  a  regulation  will  be  issued  under  the  Corporation  Code  requiring \nNGOs providing microfinance and other related financial services to disclose this information to \nthe  SEC.  To  support  collaborative  action  among  Government,  the  banking  community,  the \ncooperative  sector,  the  NGO  sector  and  the  donor  community,  a  Philippine  Declaration  on \nMicrofinance will be issued towards fulfilling the MDGs and the MTDP 2004-2010. \n \n\n2. \n\nBuild  Viable  MFIs  that  can  Provide  Efficient  and  Cost-Effective  Retail \nDelivery of Services to the Poor  \n\n \n38. \nTo  increase  efficiencies  of  MFIs,  government  regulatory  agencies,  GFIs,  and  other \nstakeholders  will  join  together  through  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  to  adopt  and \nimplement  NCC  MFI  performance  standards,  effective  immediately.  The  MOA  was  signed \nOctober 2005. The performance standards will assist the MFIs in efficient, cost-effective delivery \nof microfinance services to the poor, and include credit risk management, operational efficiency, \nfinancial efficiency, and stability standards based on international best practices. To support a \nfast implementation, training modules on the uniform set of MFI performance standards will be \ndeveloped and software will be designed to assist MFI management in the implementation and \nmonitoring  of  performance.  To  strengthen  governance  of  MFIs,  minimum  qualifications  and  fit \nand proper standards for board directors and key management will be established for savings \nand  credit  cooperatives.  Internal  management  systems  including  requirements  for  mandatory \ncommittees for audit, credit, election, education/training, ethics, and mediation and conciliation, \nwill also be established for savings and credit cooperatives. To support a robust credit market \nincluding microfinance, and to facilitate access to credit at lower cost, draft legislation to support \nestablishment  of  a  credit  information  system  and  a  central  credit  information  bureau  was \nsubmitted  to  Congress.  ADB  plans  to  invest  up  to  $1  million  or  25%  of  the  project  cost  in  the \nCIB with BSP owning up to 49% of the shares. CDA will issue a Directive requiring savings and \ncredit  cooperatives  to  collect  information  on  microfinance  clients  for  credit  information  system \nfor microfinance. To promote expansion of business development services (BDS) for the poor, \nNAPC in cooperation with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and private sector BDS \nproviders will issue guidelines and model BDS  manuals for widespread dissemination to MFIs \nand  free  access.  NAPC  will  conduct  agency  and  stakeholder  consultations  and  issue  Industry \nAdvisories  to  promote  adoption  of  sound,  sustainable  microfinance  schemes,  including \nmicroinsurance  and  savings/microinvestment,  to  support  the  development  and  expansion  of \nviable MFIs with products and services in compliance with existing laws.   \n \n39. \nThe Program will support formulating a privatization plan and options for the Philippine \nPostal Savings Bank (PPSB), and preparing an assessment and valuation of PPSB for DOF\u2019s \n\n \n\n\fPrivatization  and  Management  Office  and  PPSB  Board  of  Directors  with  a  view  to  bringing  in \nstrategic investment for an accelerated outreach of savings and remittance services in rural and \nremote areas. Mobilization of savings through postal savings networks can be an effective way \nto expand outreach and provide essential services to the rural poor in remote areas. Maintaining \nsynergies with the postal infrastructure will be important to achieve national outreach. TA will be \nprovided as required to support PPSB in the planning and preparation of a privatization plan and \noptions.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthen  Regulatory  and  Supervisory  Capacities  and  Oversight  for  a \nSound Microfinance Sector \n\n \n40. \nTo promote a sound cooperative sector, legislative amendments have been submitted to \namend  Cooperative  Development  Authority  RA  No.  6939  and  RA  Act  No.  6938  Cooperative \nCode  of  the  Philippines  to  allow  restructuring  of  the  CDA  into  a  full  regulatory  body  and  to \nprovide  enhanced  authority  and  powers  to  CDA  to  effectively  regulate  cooperatives,  including \nthe  power  to  approve  and  implement  standards,  rules  and  regulations,  and  guidelines  for  the \nvarious types of cooperatives, and power for joint regulation of cooperative banks by CDA and \nBSP. CDA was transferred from the Office of the President to DOF to strengthen regulatory and \noversight  functions  of  CDA  over  the  cooperative  sector,  and  to  facilitate  development  of \nregulation  and  supervision  of  credit  and  savings  cooperatives.  A  reorganization  plan  to \nstrengthen  CDA  regulatory  oversight  of  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  including  offices  for \nmonitoring  financial  performance  of  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  will  be  prepared  and \ncapacity  building  provided  for  CDA  staff  to  support  implementation.  Assistance  will  also  be \nprovided  for  developing  the  CDA  registration  and  database systems,  which  are  recognized  as \nseverely lacking for effective monitoring and oversight.  \n \n 41.  Regional  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  conducted  by  CDA  and  DOF  for  the \ndevelopment  of  prudential  rules  and  regulations  for  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  and \nprudential  rules  and  regulations  will  be  issued  by  CDA  for  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  to \nensure safe and sound operations of the more than 4,500 savings and credit cooperatives and \nto protect the investments and savings of the poor. CDA will issue a manual of prudential rules \nand  regulations  in  collaboration  with  DOF,  NCC,  and  BSP.  BSP  regulations  will  be  issued  to \nstrengthen audit and risk management committees, and the scope of examination for safe and \nsound  conduct  of  business.  Supervision  guidelines  will  be  issued  by  BSP  to  pilot  risk-based \nsupervision  for  banks.  Risk  based  supervision  for  microfinance  will  be  adopted  and \nimplemented by BSP, and supervision and examination manuals issued for supervising banks \nengaged in microfinance recognizing the special characteristics of operations.   \n \n\n4. \n\nIncrease Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection for the Poor  \n\n \nThe  MDP  will  support  development  of  a  national  financial  literacy  program,  including \n42. \ngender education and consumer protection, with NAPC as the lead implementing agency. The \nfinancial  literacy  program  is  envisioned  to  increase  awareness  of  the  poor  people  and  the \ngeneral public as well, on the basic concepts and importance of microfinance and other forms of \nfinancial intermediation, and on managing financial resources, both in the household and local \neconomy.  NAPC will work through the KALAHI network and the NAPC member agencies which \ninclude  24  national  government  agencies,  local  government  units,  14  NAPC  Basic  Sectoral \nCouncils,  microfinance  providers,  and  microfinance  training  institutions/technical  service \nproviders,  for  dissemination  and  adoption  of  the  program.  In  collaboration  with  these \nagencies/sectors, NAPC will determine the scope and the design of the program to achieve  a \ngreater and wider expansion for microfinance access by the poor in the country. Assistance will \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nbe  provided  under  the  MDP  to  support  institutionalization  and  expansion  of  sustainable \nmicrofinance education in primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities, and \ntraining  centers.  The  NAPC  will  facilitate  integration  of  the  financial  literacy  program  into  the \nvarious existing extension, training and education programs and projects of some of its member \nagencies including Department of Education, Commission for Higher Education, Department of \nLabor  and  Employment,  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government,  Department  of  Social \nWelfare  and  Development,  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform,  Department  of  Environment  and \nNatural  Resources,  People\u2019s  Credit  and  Finance  Corporation,  CDA,  National  Commission  on \nthe Role of Filipino Women, and National Commission on Indigenous People. The NAPC Basic \nSectoral Councils will also promote adoption of the financial literacy program in the respective \ncouncils\u2019 member organizations\u2019 training and education activities.   \n      \nNAPC  will  establish  a  free  public  access  website  to  support  consumer  protection  and \n43. \nprovide  a  consumer  action  channel  for  the  poor.  The  free  public  access  website  will  include \ncapacity  for  the  public  to  make  inquiries  and  file  complaints  online  for MFIs  not  in compliance \nwith  Philippine  laws  and  regulations.  NAPC  will  submit  complaints  to  relevant  authorities  and \npublish annually the number and type of complaints received in NAPC\u2019s Annual Report to the \nPresident  and  Congress.  To  facilitate  access  by  the  poor  to  computer  and  internet  facilities, \nNAPC  will  enter  into  strategic  partnerships  with  public  and  private  organizations  nationwide.  \nNAPC  will  issue  a  guidebook  on  consumer  protection  for  the  poor  and  users  of  microfinance \nservices,  including  information  on  Philippines\u2019  procedures  for  filing  consumer  complaints  and \npublish  the  guidebook  on  NAPC\u2019s  free  public  access  website  and  distribute  it  to  industry \nassociations,  LGUs,  MFIs  and  consumer  and  basic  sector  groups.  Under  the  Program, \nrequirements  will  also  be  established  for  MFIs  to  have  a  designated  compliance  officer  to \nensure regulated MFIs understanding and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. \n \nC. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a loan of \n44. \n$150 million. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources with a 15-year term, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. At \nGovernment\u2019s  request,  the  grace  period  was  extended  from  three  to  five  years  due  to  the \npoverty  reduction  target  of  the  MDP.  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  utilized  over  a \nperiod of 24 months from the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \n45. \nThe  proposed  loan  size  is  based  upon  the  program\u2019s  development  impact,  the \nimportance of the sector, and the associated adjustment costs related to the structural reforms. \nA  national  financial  literacy  program  for  the  poor  will  require  substantial  resources  and \ncommitment  from  Government  over  the  near  and  medium  term.  On  a  per  person  basis,  $150 \nmillion  translates  into  less  than  $6  per  person  during  this  initial  phase,  assuming  that  poor \nindividuals  currently  accessing  microfinance  services  also  need  the  proper  education  to  fully \nunderstand the services and products offered, and their rights and obligations. The total costs of \na  national  financial  program  are  expected  to  be  far  greater  than  this  amount,  and  it  is \nrecognized that even persons not classified as poor need the appropriate training for financial \nliteracy  to  ensure  safe  and  sound  financial  activities  and  protection  of  their  money.  \nEnhancement  of  regulatory  authorities  capacities  and  oversight  will  also  result  in  significant \ncosts. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \n46. \nDOF will be the Executing Agency for the MDP and provide overall guidance for project \nimplementation.  The  NCC  Secretariat  has  been  nominated  by  the  Secretary  of  Finance  to  be \nthe  program  management  unit  (PMU)  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  program  and  to \ncoordinate  activities  among  the  participating  agencies.  The  NCC  inter-agency  committees \nchaired by DOF, including representatives from NEDA and the participating agencies BIR, BSP, \nCDA, PPSB, SEC, and NAPC, will provide ongoing forums to facilitate sector reforms. \n \n47. \nInclusive social planning will be achieved through NAPC and the Government\u2019s KALAHI \nprogram, which provides a voice to indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged groups. Direct \nfield  research,  surveys,  and  consultations  with  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  are  also  part  of \nNAPC\u2019s  mandate  as  the  oversight  body  under  the  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act \n(RA  8425)  for  the  development  and  strengthening  of  the  microfinance  industry.  This  act \nidentifies the disadvantaged sectors of Philippine society (also referred to as the \u201cbasic sectors\u201d) \nas  farmers  and  landless  rural  workers,  artisanal  fisherfolk,  urban  poor,  indigenous  cultural \ncommunities  and  indigenous  peoples,  workers  in  the  formal  sector  and  migrant  workers, \nworkers in the informal sector, women, youth and students, persons with disabilities, victims of \ndisasters  and  calamities,  nongovernment  organizations,  children,  and  cooperatives.  Through \nKALAHI, NAPC solicits the active participation of \u201cbasic sector\u201d organizations, other civil society \norganizations,  and  the  business  sector  in  its  poverty  reduction  programs  and  activities.  This \nmulti-stakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC poverty reduction \ninitiatives.  Sectoral  councils, \nformed  by  members  of  each  \u201cbasic  sector\u201d,  nominate \nrepresentatives for appointment by the President of the Republic.29 \n \n48. \nExisting poverty mapping systems at the local level will be used to assess the impact of \nthe Program and determine access poverty. The community-based monitoring system (CBMS), \nestablished by the Department of Interior and Local Government, collects relevant, timely, and \nlocal  access  poverty  indicators.  Under  this  system,  local  government  units  (LGUs)  collect  13 \nsurvival, security and enabling indicators annually that gauge access to education, health, and \nother vital services. The CBMS data allow for detailed poverty mapping at the local level and for \ntargeting  and  monitoring  of  interventions,  based  on  knowledge  of  the  specific  determinants  of \naccess poverty at the household level. In addition, data from other poverty mapping initiatives, \nincluding those of the Peace Equity Foundation and the National Statistical Coordination Board, \nwill  be  used  to  assess  program  impact.  NAPC  is  responsible  for  local  poverty  indicator \nmonitoring,  and  NAPC  under  its  mandate  from  the  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act \nalso  tracks  key  data  on  microfinance  services  and  outreach,  including  gender  impact.  NAPC \nsubmits an annual report to Congress and the President. \n \n49. \nIn  1999,  the  Government  initiated  the  public  expenditure  management  improvement \nprogram.  This  consists  of  three  major  and  interrelated  components:  (i)  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  (MTEF),  (ii)  the  sector  effectiveness  and  efficiency  review,  and  (iii) the \norganizational performance indicator framework.  The MTEF aims to restructure the budget over \nthe medium term to better support the Government\u2019s development plan and improve operational \nefficiency by ensuring predictability of resources. The MTEF requires departments and agencies \nto formulate 3-year budgets consonant with the 3-year departmental baseline budgets issued by \nthe Department of Budget and Management (DBM). The sector effective and efficiency review \naims  to  strengthen  and  systematize  the  budget  prioritization  process  in  line  with  the  MTDP. \n\n                                                 \n29 Sectoral representatives serve for a term of 3 years as members of NAPC along with heads of government bodies \n\nand presidents of the Leagues of Local Government Units (LGUs). \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nConducted  by  individual  departments  and  agencies  under  the  guidance  of  NEDA,  it  evaluates \nexisting  budgetary  programs,  activities,  and  projects  on  the  basis  of  their  importance  in \nachieving  desired  sector  and  department  outcomes.  The  sector  effectiveness  and  efficiency \nreview  is  used  to  improve  and  update  the  Medium-Term  Public  Investment  Program  and \nprepare agency budget proposals. The organizational performance indicator framework requires \ndepartments  and  agencies  to  specify  their  outcomes/outputs,  indicators  of  performance, \naccomplishments  and  targets,  and  the  corresponding  budgetary  allocations  for  related \nprograms,  activities,  and  projects.  This  framework  will  eventually  be  tied  to  the  performance \nassessment  of  individual  officials  and  employees  of  the  Government.  These  initiatives \nstrengthen  Government\u2019s  public  financial  management  system,  and  show  Government\u2019s \ncommitment for sound financial management.30 Overall financial management arrangements for \nthe Program are deemed satisfactory. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the officials \nof the Government during program processing. \n \n\n1. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \n50. \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  to  disburse  the \nloan  proceeds  based  on  certification  provided  by  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required, if during each year loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, \nthe  value  of  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines\u2019  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year (see \nAppendix 5). The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n51. \nThe counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe  associated  structural  adjustment  costs  and  activities  consistent  with  the  MDP,  and  the \ndevelopment of a sustainable and diverse, market-oriented microfinance sector with expanded \noutreach of a wider range of services at competitive prices for the poor. \n \n\n3. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \nThe  program  period  will  be  24  months.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The \n52. \nfirst tranche of $75  million will be made available upon the  Government meeting conditions of \nloan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $75  million  is  expected  to  be  released  within  24 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. The progress of implementation of specified policy actions set out \nin the policy matrix (Appendix 3) will be reviewed by ADB with the Government on an ongoing \nbasis. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2005. Governance Assessment: Philippines. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n \n53. \nThe objective of the TA is to (i) promote financial literacy and assist the Government in \ndeveloping a national financial literacy program for the poor and users of microfinance services; \n(ii) build viable MFIs that can provide efficient and cost effective retail delivery of services to the \npoor; and (iii) establish a consumer protection framework to reduce vulnerability of the poor to \nillegal and unsound practices. To achieve these objectives, the TA will focus on: \n \n\npromoting  financial  literacy  and  assisting  NAPC,  in  collaboration  with  other \nconcerned agencies and departments, local government units, and microfinance \ntraining  institutions,  in  the  development  of  a  national  financial  literacy  program, \nincluding  gender  education  and  consumer  protection  for  the  poor  and  users  of \nmicrofinance  services;  developing  model(s)  for  sound  microinsurance  and \nsavings/  micro-investment  practices  in  consonance  with  existing  laws  and \nregulation; and preparing guidelines and business development services models \nfor MFIs; \n\nincreasing the efficiency of MFIs through (a) development of training modules on \nthe uniform set of MFI performance standards to promote adoption by MFIs, and \nto provide effective tools for training regulators, MFI management, microfinance \nwholesalers  of  funds,  and  rating  agencies;  (b)  design  of  software  for  the \nmicrofinance  sector  for  monitoring  performance  and  assessing  MFI  compliance \nto the performance standards; and (c) MFI training on performance standards. \n\nformulating  a  privatization  plan  and  options  for  PPSB,  and  preparing  an \nassessment  and  valuation  of  PPSB  for  DOF\u2019s  Privatization  and  Management \nOffice  and  PPSB  Board  of  Directors  with  a  view  to  bringing  in  strategic \ninvestment  for  an  accelerated  outreach  of  savings  and  remittance  services  in \nrural and remote areas; and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nestablishing  a  free  public  access  website  to  support  consumer  protection, \nincluding a public service section to assist the poor in making inquiries and filing \nconsumer  complaints  on  MFIs  not  in  compliance  with  Philippine  law  and \nregulation,  and  issuance  of  a  consumer  protection  guidebook  for  the  poor  and \nusers of microfinance. \n\n \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $715,000  equivalent,  comprising  $157,000  as  foreign \n54. \nexchange equivalent and $558,000 as local currency. The Government had requested ADB to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $343,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \n(JSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $215,000 equivalent \nto finance counterpart staff and office facilities. The Executing Agency, DOF,  will oversee and \ncoordinate  the  TA,  and  provide  the  necessary  counterpart  staff  and  office  space  for  the \nconsultants. A senior official will be appointed to serve as the TA Project Manager. The TA will \nbe  implemented  over  a  22-month  period  and is  planned to commence  by  March  2006  and  be \ncompleted  by  December  2007.  Consulting  services  will  include:  (i)  six  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  with  expertise  in  MFI  training  and  development,  software  design  and \ndevelopment,  financial  valuation  of  corporations  and  financial  institutions,  and  privatization  in \nthe  financial  sector;  and  (ii)  46  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  the \nmicrofinance sector\u23afincluding laws, regulations, practices, services, and products offered by all \ntypes  of  MFIs,  financial  literary  program  development  and  training,  website  design  and \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\ndevelopment, consumer protection, and information services for the poor. A firm will be selected \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  quality  and  cost-based \nselection  (QCBS)  method  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  used  for  consultant \nselection. The cost estimates and financing plan and detailed terms of reference for consultants \nare provided in Appendixes 7 and 8, respectively. \n \n55. \nIn  parallel  with  the  preparation  of  the  MDP,  an  associated  project  is  being  developed, \nDeveloping  Financial  Cooperatives,  for  possible  financing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction  (JFPR)  in  the  amount  of  $900,000,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Government  of \nJapan.  This  project  is  designed  to  develop  monitoring  and  regulatory  capacities  of  CDA  and \nprovide  capacity  building  of  the  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  sector  over  2005\u20132008  for \nefficient and sound operations. Under the proposed project, the operations and performance of \ncredit and savings cooperatives would be strengthened through training of cooperative officers \nand  trainers,  including  performance  standards  and  international  best  practices,  conducted  by \ncooperative federations accredited by CDA. Inspectors will also receive training on supervision \nand  examination  techniques,  and  the  performance  monitoring  capacities  of  CDA  would  be \nimproved by the installation of an advanced registration and management information system. A \ndraft proposal summary is attached as Appendix 9. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impact on Poverty \n\n \nA. \n \n56. \nThe Program will provide significant benefits and will have positive impacts on the poor. \nThe Program will support the Government in achieving the MDGs, including eradicating extreme \npoverty  and  hunger  and  the  promotion  of  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women. \nPreliminary estimates of potential impact of some measures are shown in Table 2.  \n \n57. \nThe Program supports the Government\u2019s vision of a financial sector that fosters broad-\nbased,  sustainable  economic  growth,  reduces  poverty  and  contributes  to  macroeconomic \nstability. The program will support a sustainable, diverse, market-oriented microfinance sector, \nwith expanded outreach of services at competitive prices to the poor. The greater  outreach of \nmicrofinance  services  with  lower  costs  to  the  poor  will  increase  livelihood  and  income-\ngenerating  activities,  that  will  in  turn  result  in  increased  investment,  job  creation,  and  tax \nrevenues to the Government.  \n \n58. \nThe  poor  will  benefit  from  improved  efficiencies  and  performance  of  service  providers \nthat can provide more cost-effective retail delivery of services on a sustainable basis. Sustained \naccess  to  microfinance  services  will  enable  the  poor  to  build  viable  businesses,  pursue \neconomic  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities,  and  reduce  their  vulnerability  to \nshocks and contingencies. Microenterprises will be able to expand, benefiting owners and their \nfamilies directly and the broader economy indirectly through increased economic activity.      \n \n59. \nThe  removal  of  regulatory  impediments  to  competition  and  barriers  to  expansion  by \nfinancially  sound  and  well-managed  microfinance  institutions  will  result  in  a  more  robust  and \ncompetitive  environment  that  will  increase  the  outreach  of  MFIs  and  the  range  of  available \nservices, and lower the cost of services to the poor. The poor will benefit from the introduction of \ntruth-in-lending to all types of MFIs for full disclosure of costs of borrowing and transparency in \ntransactions. \n\n \n\n\f \n60.  Microfinance  providers,  clients  and  the  poor  will  benefit  from  an  enabling  and \ntransparent  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime,  with  stronger  regulatory  bodies  capable  of \neffective  oversight  to  ensure  protection  of  poor  people\u2019s  money  and  sound  MFI  operations. \nGreater  transparency  and  certainty  will  also  encourage  investment.  The  commercialization  of \nthe microfinance sector will stimulate investment in the sector, bringing strategic resources and \ntechnology for the management of MFIs.  \n \nRemittance  services  for  the  poor,  including  in rural  areas,  will  be  expanded,  and  lower \n61. \ncost  transfer  of  remittances  via  cell  phone  based  technology  will  be  facilitated  through  the \ndevelopment  of  a  supporting  regulatory  framework.  Transfer  of  OFW  remittances  directly  into \nMFI  deposit  accounts  will  eliminate  the  costly  middleman  fees  common  in  current  tie-up \narrangements.  Lowering  the  cost  of  transfers  and  payments  is  important,  especially  for  poor \nfamilies.  Remittances  from  OFWs  can  also  play  a  significant  role  in  mobilizing  the  necessary \nsavings  for  increased  outreach  and  sustainability  of  MFI  operations.  If  MFIs  can  capture  only \n15% of the informal remittance flows currently believed to be outside the formal banking system, \nthat would translate into $1.3 billion. Even If only 10% of that amount is retained as savings after \nconsumption, significant capital will be mobilized in this sector.   \n\n     \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n62. \nThe  poor  will  be  empowered  and  will  benefit  from  a  national  financial  literacy  program \nthat  will  increase  awareness  and  understanding  on  basic  concepts  and  importance  of \nmicrofinance and other forms of financial intermediation, and on managing financial resources, \nboth in the household and local economy. Business development services for the poor will also \nbe  expanded  to  help  the  poor  develop  livelihood  activities  and  expand  their  microenterprises. \nConsumer  protection  will  be  strengthened  to  reduce  vulnerability  of  the  poor  and  users  of \nmicrofinance  services  to  illegal  and  unsound  practices,  and  a  free  public  access  website  will \nsupport consumer protection and facilitate inquiries and filing of complaints.  \n \nB. \n \n63. \nNo  impacts  related  to  ADB\u2019s  environment  and  resettlement  policies  are  anticipated \nunder  this  loan.  Indigenous  peoples  will  be  targeted  through  the  Government\u2019s  KALAHI \nprogram,  which  seeks  to  reduce  poverty  throughout  the  country.  Monitoring  of  KALAHI  has \nshown that some indigenous peoples are relatively difficult to involve in the program, so special \ninitiatives  are  being  planned  so  they  can  be  reached  more  effectively.  These  initiatives  will \npertain to KALAHI-facilitated activities under the MDP as well.  In addition, the MDP will ensure \nthat  outreach  to  potential  beneficiaries,  and  training  programs  for  borrowers  and  savers  (in \nfinancial literacy, gender, and consumer protection) and for staff of MFIs be made accessible to \nindigenous  peoples.  This  may  require  delivery  of  courses  in  remote  locations  and  in  local \nlanguages.

On a combined basis, the total annual savings in interest costs for the poor from increasing \ncompetition  and  from  mobilizing  savings  could  range  from  $17million  to  $45  million  per  year \ncalculated  using  an  initial  principal  loan  amount  of  P2,000  to,  P4,000  and  assuming  2.1  million \nclients. With a larger MFI client base, the  annual savings to the poor would be higher.  \n\nLower Cost of Transfer of Remittances: \n\nBased on current cost estimates, families receiving remittances from OFWs utilizing cell-phone based \ntechnologies could save : \n\nEstimated savings per transaction (may be \nhigher) \n\nEstimated savings per year per worker \nassuming 12 transactions (may be higher) \n \n\n              $20  \n\n    \n\n \n\n $240 \n\n                             or P13,416 \n\n(at exchange rate of P55.90 = $1.00) \n\nCalculating assuming MFIs capture 10% of the estimated $8.6 billion remittances believed to flow \nthrough  informal  channels,  and  assuming  an  average  monthly  remittance  amount  of  $300,  this \nwould translate into 2.87 million transactions per year.  At $20 savings per transaction, this would \ntranslate into potential savings to the poor of $57.4 million per year.   \n\nIncreased Income-Generating and Employment Opportunities for the Poor: \n\n      There  are  currently  17  million  poor  people  who  lack  access  to  microfinance  services.  Universal \naccess  to  microfinance  services  could  mean  self-employment  for  17  million  people,  or  self-\nemployment for a majority, some of whom would also employ others. Preliminary field data show that \nsome  microfinance  clients  who  progressed  to  the  third  cycle  of  borrowing,  and  also  received  BDS \nsupport  to  strengthen  management  and/or  operations,  were  able  to  expand  business  and  hire  2-3 \npeople. \n\nIncreased Productivity of MFI Clients and MFI Staff: \n\nTransfers  and  payments  using  cell  phone  based  technology  can  not  only  reduce  the  direct  cost  of \ntransactions, but can significantly reduce the indirect costs associated with these transactions. Clients \nliving  in  remote  areas  may  walk  up  to  four  hours  each  way  to  an  MFI/representative  to  make  a \npayment, resulting in the loss of one days productive work. For MFI staff, the time savings and impact \non productivity would also be significant.  \n\nSources:  ADB estimates; Globe Telecom; Mindanao Capital Corporation; and National Anti-Poverty Commission. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n \nC. \n \n65. \n  \n\nRisks \n\nImplementation of the Program could be affected by a number of factors. \n\nThe  principal  risk  stems  from  resistance  by  vested  interests  groups  to  reforms, \nincluding measures for increased transparency, disclosure and competition. Such \nresistance can be overcome through the Government\u2019s continued commitment to \npoverty reduction and the development of microfinance and microenterprises as \nembodied in the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act and the MTDP, 2004-\n2010. \n\nThere may also be delays because of political instability or social unrest, and lack \nof capacity to implement reforms in a timely manner. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n66. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  and  implement  the  policies  and  program \nactions  indicated  in  the  MDP  as  specified  in  the  Development  Policy  Letter, \nincluding the Policy Matrix, in a timely manner and shall ensure that such policies \nand actions will continue in effect during and after the MDP. \n\nThe Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation  by  facilitating  consultations  with  related  agencies  and  other  key \nstakeholders as appropriate. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  an  equitable  opportunity  among  women  and \nindigenous peoples in activities conducted under the MDP, including initiatives in \noutreach  and  training,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment and Policy on Indigenous Peoples.   \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant \nstudies and draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on program objectives \nand implementation. \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available \nto the DOF and the relevant agencies to facilitate implementation of the program. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n67. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB, and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $150,000,000 to the Republic of the \nPhilippines  for  the  Microfinance  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility, a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n \n \n28 October 2005 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nVarious microfinance services are provided in the Philippines by banks, cooperatives, and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  including  184  banks1  (rural,  thrift  and  cooperative  banks), \nabout  500  NGOs,  and  4,579  savings  and  credit  cooperatives.  Many  other  types  of  registered \ncooperatives  also  provide  some  form  of  financial  services.  In  addition,  an  increasing  number  of \nfinancial  institutions  are  engaging  in  microfinance,  while  informal  and  unregulated  institutions  are \nmoving  toward  formalization.  MFI  NGOs  have  played  an  important  role  in  providing  services  in \nhard-to-reach areas where the private sector has not entered and where there is less information \non  the  markets  and  potential  clients.  The  number  of  active  borrowers  from  banks  engaged  in \nmicrofinance  was  reported  by  BSP  at  549,348  as  of  December  2004.  NAPC  reports  show  total \nborrowers at 2.1 million, including bank clients, as of June 2005 based on information reported by \ngovernment financial institutions engaged in wholesale lending to microfinance institutions.  \n \n2. \nAlthough the Philippines has achieved significant progress in promoting microfinance, more \nthan two-thirds of poor households, or 17 million people, still do not have access to microfinance \nservices.2    Instead,  the  poor  rely  heavily  on  self-finance  or  informal  sources  that  may  be  very \ncostly, limiting their ability to participate in and benefit from development opportunities and income-\ngenerating activities. The limited outreach of microfinance services is reported in the National Anti-\nPoverty  Commission  (NAPC)  2004  report,  Status  of  Microfinance  Outreach  in  60  Poorest \nProvinces,  which  details  outreach,  potential  number  of  client  households,  and  saturation  level  of \nmicrofinance services in each area.  Access to microfinance services can help the poor build viable \nbusinesses,  pursue  economic  opportunities  and \nincome-generating  activities,  and  reduce \nvulnerability  to  external  shocks  or  contingencies.  Microfinance  is  the  central  strategy  for  poverty \nreduction  in  the  Philippines  under  Republic  Act  8425  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act, \nand  is  an  important  part  of  the  Medium  Term  Philippines  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  2004-2010.   \nHowever,  despite  Government  commitment  and  development  of  the  sector  to  date,  further \nmeasures  are  required to  meet  popular  demand,  achieve Government\u2019s  goal  of  universal  access \noriginally targeted for 2005, and address systemic weaknesses in the sector.  \n \n3. \n Microfinance encompasses a range of services including savings deposits, loans, payment \nservices, money transfers, remittances, and insurance. Historically, microfinance has concentrated \non microcredit designed for high-turnover microenterprises. In practice, however, it was found that \nclients also adapted the loans for a variety of purposes such as medical expenses, funerals, and \nschool  fees  in  addition  to  funding  livelihood  activities.  Microfinance  is  also  important  for  land \nacquisition,  housing  construction,  purchase  of  animals,  consumer  durables  and  other  items. \nBangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP)  regulations3  specify  that  the  maximum  principal  amount  of  a \nmicrofinance  loan  shall  not  exceed  P150,000,  however  loans  are  often  in  the  amount  of    P4,000 \nand  below.  Interest  rates  in  the  market  are  high,  and  it  is  not  uncommon  to  see  rates  of  60%  or \nmore  per  annum.  High  rates  of  interest  could  be  reduced  through  competitive  pricing  and \nincreased efficiencies to lower cost of borrowing to the poor. MFI clients are broadly the poor and \nlow-income households and their microenterprises,4 however more than 90% of borrowers to date \nhave been women. Who controls the funds once received, and how these are managed within the \nhousehold  unit  are  areas  for  further  examination.    The  MFI  clients  typically  lack  assets  for \n\n                                                 \n1  BSP data as of 31 December 2004. \n2  Source: NAPC.

In 2001, microenterprises accounted for 91.7% of the \ntotal number of registered business firms in the Philippines and 38% of total employment.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n27\n\ncollateral,  are  self-employed  in  the  informal  sector  or  engaged  in  economic  livelihood  activities. \nLoans are provided based on the borrower's household's net cash flow and non-traditional forms of \nsecurity,  and  may  be  provided  either  on  a  group  or  individual  lending  basis.5  The  microfinance \nsector as a whole has had very good repayment rates, and this is one of the attractive features of \nthis market for financial institutions. The demand for savings services is considered as strong as or \nstronger  than  the  demand  for  credit,  and  going  forward  an  expansion  of  the  outreach  of  savings \nservices will be essential to achieve institutional sustainability and poverty reduction.  \n \n\nTable A1.1: Providers of Microfinance in the Philippines \n\nType \n\nOwnership \n\nLegal \nBasis \n\nRegulated \nby \n\nSupervised \nBy \n\n \n \n \nBSP, PDIC  BSP, PDIC \n\n \n \n \n\n \nBSP, PDIC  BSP, PDIC \n\n \n\n \nBSP, SEC \n\n \nNone \n\n \n \n \nThrift Banks \nAct, Law on \nCorporations \n\n \nRural Banks \nAct, law on \ncorporations \n\n \nGeneral \nbanking law \n\n \nGeneral \nbanking law, \nlaw on \ncorporations \n \n \n \nCooperatives \ncode \n\n \nFormal Institutions \n \nThrift Banks \n\n \nPrivate \nInvestors \n\n \nRural Banks \n\n \nPawnshops \n\n \nLending \nInvestors \n\n \nPrivate \nInvestors \n\n \nPrivate \nInvestors \n\n \nPrivate \nInvestors \n\n \n\n \nSemiformal Institutions \n \n(Savings and \nCredit) \nCooperatives \n\nIndividual \nmembers \n\n \nNGOs \n\n \nPrivate \ntrustees \n\n \n \n \nCDA \n\n \n \n \nNone \n\n \nNone \n\n \nLaw on \ntrusts and \nnonprofit \nfoundations \n \n\n \nAnnual \nreports to \nSEC and \nBSP \n \n\nMain \nFunding \nSources \n\n \n \n \nEquity, \ncommercial \nloans, \ndeposits \n \nEquity, \ncommercial \nloans, \ndeposits \n \nEquity, \ncommercial \nloans \n \nEquity, \ncommercial \nloans \n\n \n \n \nCapital plus \nmember \ndeposits \n\n \nGrants, \ndonations, \ncommercial \nloans \n \n\nAuthorized \nActivities \n\nTarget \nMarket \n\n \n \n \nSavings \ndeposits and \nloans \n\n \nSavings \ndeposits and \nloans \n\n \n \n \nGeneral \npublic \n\n \nGeneral \npublic \n\n \nPawn loans  General \n\n \n\npublic \n\n \nGeneral \npublic \n\n \n \n \nMembers \n\n \nGeneral \npublic \n\n \n \n \nSaving \ndeposits and \nloan to \nmembers \n \nLoans to \nindividuals \nand groups \n\n \nSEC \n\n \nNone \n\n \nLoans \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBSP  =  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  CDA  =  Cooperative  Development  Authority,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization, \nPDIC \u2013 Philippine Deposit Insurance Commission, SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission. \nSource: ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n \nForeign investment is currently limited to 60% of thrift banks under the Thrift Banks Act of \n4. \n1995, and no foreign ownership of rural banks is allowed under the Rural Banks Act of 1992. The \nrationale in allowing foreign ownership for the thrift banks had been the larger capital requirements \nfor that sector. There is an option under the General Banking Law of 2000, whereby the Monetary \nBoard  may  authorize  a  foreign  bank  to  acquire  up  to  100%  of  the  voting  stock  of  one  Philippine \nbank only. Opening the rural banking sector to foreign investment could be very beneficial in the \nmedium  to  long-term  to  catalyze  the  industry,  provide  strategic  investment  and  increase \ngovernance  in  a  sector  that  historically  been  dominated  by  family-owned  banks.

It  is  also  an  important  part  of \nPresident  Arroyo\u2019s  10-point  agenda  which  calls  for  the  creation  of  10  million  new  jobs,  and  the \nPhilippine\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010 which includes microfinance as a main \nstrategy  and  proven  effective  tool  in  alleviating  poverty.  The  G-8  Action  Plan  for  poverty  reduction \nincludes expanding access to microfinance for entrepreneurs1 and working with the Consultative Group to \nAssist  the  Poor  (CGAP)2  to  promote  best  practices  in  microfinance  for  developing  countries.  Ensuring \npermanent  access  to  institutional  financial  services  for  poor  and  low-income  households  at  competitive \nprices  is  a  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  Microfinance  Development  Strategy3,  and  microfinance  is  a  priority  in  the \nPhilippines Country and Strategy Program (CSP) 2005-2007. \n \nMicrofinance  clients  are  broadly  the  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their  microenterprises. \nMicrofinance  encompasses  a  range  of  services  including  savings  deposits,  loans,  payment  services, \nmoney  transfers,  and  insurance.  Access  to  microfinance  services  can  help  the  poor  build  viable \nbusinesses, pursue economic opportunities and income-generating activities, and reduce vulnerability to \nexternal shocks or contingencies. Improved access and efficient provision of services can enable the poor \nto  smoothen  their  consumption,  manage  their  risks  better,  build  assets,  develop  microenterprises,  and \nenhance their income-earning capacity.  \n \n \nB. \n \nThe  Government  reported  in  the  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  2004-2010  that  poverty \nincidence  worsened  to  34  %  in  2000  from  33  %  in  1997  and  the  number  of  poor  individuals  increased \nfrom  23.95  million  in  1997  to  26.54  million  in  2000.  With  population  growing  at  2.36%  per  year  in  the \nPhilippines, heavy burdens will be placed on the social and physical infrastructure and environment with a \nprojected annual addition of 1.6 million people. Without corrective action to rebalance population growth \nagainst  the  limited  resources,  prospects  are  limited  for  moving  out  of  poverty  the  40%  of  Filipinos \ncurrently  living  on  $2  or  less  a  day.  Even  with  no  change  in  population,  \u201caccess  poverty\u201d  is  a  major \nproblem in the Philippines. Poverty is manifested in low incomes and in exclusion, including poor access \nto services which keeps the poor vulnerable. Income poverty in the Philippines is a dynamic phenomenon \nwith  people  moving  in  and  out  of  poverty  over  time.  A  survey  designed  to  gauge  chronic  and  transient \npoverty found that over a 3-year period about one fifth of the surveyed households were chronically poor, \nwhereas almost one third of the households moved in and out of poverty over the period. 4  \n \nPoverty  incidence  in  terms  of  families  in  the  60  poorest  provinces,  and  the  status  of  microfinance \noutreach is included in Appendix 1, Table A1.1.  \n\nPoverty Analysis                                       Proposed Classification: Targeted intervention \n\n                                                 \n1  June 2004 statement on the G-8 Action Plan, Applying the Power of Entrepreneurship to the Eradication of Poverty.  \n2  The  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor  (CGAP)  was  formally  established  in  1995  with  bilateral  and  multilateral \nfunding  agencies,  including  ADB,  to  expand  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  quality  financial  services  from  sustainable  or \npotentially sustainable MFIs. The CGAP Secretariat is located in World Bank headquarters. \n\n3  ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila.   \n4  Schelzig, Karin. 2005.

Who  controls  the \nfunds  once  received,  how  the  funds  are  managed  within  the  household  unit,  who  controls  the \nmicroenterprises and income generated are all areas that need further examination in determining the full \nimpacts  and  potential  benefits  for  women.  The  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission  (NAPC)  has  taken  a \nproactive role in furthering gender education for women in the Philippines, and launched an initial Gender \nIn  Microfinance  Training  Seminar  in  2005  to  address  some  of  these  issues.  The  strategy  under  the \nMicrofinance  Development  Program  (MDP)  is  to  combine  the  gender  training  with  the  planned  national \nfinancial literacy program to attain maximum outreach and education.       \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nInitial Gender in Microfinance training seminar materials have been developed by NAPC. These materials \nwill be further developed for application and dissemination with the national financial literacy program. \n \n \n\nGender Development \n\n Yes   \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks  (No negative impacts expected) \n \nItem \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nSignificant /  \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n54 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nThe  strategy  for  privatization  of  the  Philippine \nPostal  Savings  Bank  (PPSB)  is  based  on  the \nneed  for  acceleration  of  expansion  of  postal \nsavings banks in rural areas.

Grant Development Objective(s) and Expected Key Performance Indicators \nGrant Development Objectives (GDO): The ADB Philippine Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2005\u2013\n2007 identifies development of microfinance as one of the key strategies for more rapid poverty reduction. \nMicrofinance  is  recognized  as  the  central  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  Philippines  under  Republic \nAct  8425  Social  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act.  Ensuring  permanent  access  to  institutional  financial \nservices  for  poor  and  low-income  households  at  competitive  prices  is  also  a  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  Microfinance \nDevelopment  Strategy.  ADB  is  currently  formulating  the  Philippine  Microfinance  Development  Program, \nwhich aims at developing sustainable Philippine microfinance industry in line with the CSP. To complement \nthe Program, the proposed JFPR assistance aims to support the development of financial cooperatives and \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  and  efficiencies  of  the  Cooperative  Development  Authority  (CDA)  which \noversees financial cooperatives in order to provide sustainable microfinance services to the poor. \n \nAs  a  major  part  of  the  Philippines\u2019  microfinance  sector,  financial  cooperatives  need  to  develop  sound \nfinancial operations for the members. The Project aims to promote healthy development of the sustainable \nmicrofinance  industry  in  the  Philippines  to  increase  household  incomes,  reduce  poverty  and  reduce \nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  shocks  by  improving  performance  of  financial  cooperatives  through  capacity \nbuilding and strengthening their compliance with CDA\u2019s regulatory requirement and operating efficiencies. \n \nThe Project comprises the following 2 components: \n\u2022  The operations of savings and credit cooperatives will be strengthened by training sessions conducted \nby  cooperative  federations  accredited  by  CDA,  which  will  standardize  the  training  module  on  sound \nmicrofinance operations based on the international best practices. (Component A). \n\n\u2022  The  performance  monitoring  capacities  of  CDA  will  be  improved  by  the  installation  of  advanced \n\nImprove and standardize the training module on cooperative microfinance operations \n\nregistration/management information system (Component B). \nExpected Key Performance Indicators (maximum 5 indicators): \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Disseminate the CDA performance standards to financial cooperatives \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nIncrease training sessions to cooperatives, cooperative trainers, and CDA inspectors \nIncrease cooperative compliance with CDA performance standard requirement \n\nIII.
