The  Project  will  rehabilitate  140  kilometers  (km)  of  the \nDushanbe-Nurobod section of the transport corridor linking Tajikistan to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and onward to the PRC, as well as 77 km of rural \nroads serving poor villages.  Tajikistan is the poorest country among the \nCentral  Asian  republics,  with  a  poverty  incidence  of  83%.  The  poverty \nincidence in the project area is 91%.  \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  a  key  national  and  international  transport \ncorridor. The project road provides the primary link between Dushanbe \nand  the  Rasht  Valley,  to  the  northeast.  For  several  months  during  the \nwinter,  the  road  also  serves  as  a  link  between  the  northern  Sugdh \nregion  and  the  rest  of  Tajikistan.  The  project  area  was  the  scene  of \nheavy  fighting  during  Tajikistan\u2019s  civil  war  in  the  mid-1990s and has a \npoverty  incidence  of  91%.  The  improvement  of  the  rural  roads  will \nimprove  access  to  the  main  road  for  poor  villages  not  located  on  the \nmain  road,  and  therefore  improve  access  to  regional  markets  and \nDushanbe.  Numerous  agriculture  and  other  poverty  alleviation  projects \nare  being  implemented  in  the  project  area  by  other  international \norganizations,  and  by  improving  transport  in  the  area  the  Project  will \nenable the full potential of these projects to be realized. The Project will \nfacilitate  national  development  and \nregional  cooperation  by \nrehabilitating  the  corridor  connecting  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  to  the \nPRC  and  other  countries  in  the  region.  The  Project  will  address  the \nnational  problem  of  road  maintenance  by  increasing  financing  for \nmaintenance  of  national  roads  and  developing  a  maintenance  system \nfor  rural  roads.  The  Project  supports  the  strategy  of  the  Government \nand Asian Development Bank (ADB) to rehabilitate infrastructure and to \ndevelop international transport corridors. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to reduce poverty, by reducing the cost of \nroad transport and improving access to markets, and increase regional \ntrade  and  cooperation  by  rehabilitating  the  road  linking  Dushanbe  to \nNurobod  in  the  Rasht  Valley  and  on  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  PRC. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  reduce  transport  costs  on  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz \nborder  road;  (ii)  provide  agricultural  and  industrial  enterprises  with  all-\nweather  access  to  markets  within  the  country,  and eventually abroad; \n(iii) improve access of the rural poor population to market opportunities, \nother economic activities, and social services by improving rural roads; \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nother economic activities, and social services by improving rural roads; \nand (iv) strengthen the Government\u2019s institutional capacities for efficient \nmanagement  of  the  national  road  network.  The  Project  will  also \ngenerate  employment  in  construction  activities  for  local  residents.  The \nProject comprises improvement of about 140 km of the mostly two-lane \nhighway  from  Dushanbe  to  Nurobod,  through  (i)  a  combination  of \nrehabilitation of km 22\u201395, minor rehabilitation of km 95\u2013150, and minor \nworks on the km 9\u201322 section; (ii) improvement of 77 km of rural roads \nin the project area; (iii) consulting services for construction supervision, \nmonitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures to improve road \nsafety,  auditing,  and  project  management;  and  (iv)  procurement  of \nmaintenance equipment for use in routine and periodic maintenance of \nthe improved road sections. \n \n\n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand interest and other charges during construction (but excluding local \ntaxes),  is  estimated  at  $23.6  million  equivalent,  of  which  $16.8  million \n(71%) is foreign exchange cost and $6.8 million (29%) is local currency \ncost. \n \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated \nProject \nCompletion \nDate \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n($ million) \nTotal \nCost \n15.0 \n2.6 \n6.0 \n23.6 \n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n14.4 \n0.3 \n2.1 \n16.8 \n\n0.6 \n2.3 \n3.9 \n6.8 \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nOPEC Fund  \n \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates .      \n \n \nA  loan  of  SDR  10,476,000  ($15  million  equivalent)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard \nterms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund \nresources.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years  including  a \ngrace  period  of  8  years  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% during the remaining period.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2008 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nThe  project  implementation  unit  currently  implementing  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the \nProject,  including  the  rehabilitation  of  the  sections  of  the  Dushanbe-\nKyrgyz border road and the improvement of the rural roads. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nProcurement \n \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nMinistry of Transportation \n\n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and  $1.0  million  for  civil  works  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Supply contracts not \nexceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping. \nCivil  works  for  rehabilitation  of  the  Vahdat-Faisabod-Obigarm sections \n(km  22\u201395)  have  been  packaged  into  one  contract  and  will  follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  for  the  km  9\u2013\n22 and km 95\u2013150 sections and the rural road improvement component \nwill  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Supply \ncontracts  for  the  equipment  will  be  packaged  based  on  the  technical \nrequirements  of  the  equipment  and  will  be  finalized  during  project \nimplementation.  Advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  was \napproved at the Management Review Meeting and is under way. \n \nInternational  consulting  services  for  44  person-months will be provided \nby  a  firm,  for  construction  supervision,  project  impact  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  implementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety, \nauditing,  and  project  management.  The  international  consultants  will \nalso  provide  on-the-job  training  to  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic \nconsultants.  In  association  with  the  international  consultants,  domestic \nconsulting  services  totaling  300  person-months  will  be  provided  for \nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical \nadvisory  assistance;  as  well  as \ninternational \nconsultants  in  monitoring  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the  Project \nthrough  household  survey  and  data  analysis.  The  consultants  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used \nin selecting the consultants.  \n \nThe Project will reduce transport costs for residents in the project area \nand  improve  access  to  markets  for  agricultural  goods,  to  employment \nopportunities,  and  to  social  services.  The  Project  will  directly  affect \n144,000 people in the project area, while 440,000 people live in the four \ndistricts  traversed  by  the  road  (excluding  Dushanbe).  The  primary \neconomic benefits from the Project include savings in vehicle operating \ncosts,  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  time  savings  for \npassenger  traffic,  and  poverty  alleviation.  Poverty  alleviation  benefits \narise  from  the  increased  prices  for  agricultural  products  that  will  be \nreceived  by  poor  households  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  also \nhave  other  benefits,  which  cannot  be  quantified,  including  improved \naccess  to  health  and  other  social  services,  improved  access  to \nDushanbe  and  other  areas  with  more  employment  opportunities,  and \nimproved road safety. The economic internal rate of return is estimated \nto be 15.8%. Due to the competitive nature of the markets for transport \nservices in the project area, most of the benefits from vehicle operating \n\nfor  assisting \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nservices in the project area, most of the benefits from vehicle operating \ncost savings will be passed on to transport users. Most of the users of \npassenger transport services will be residents of the project area, and \nbenefits are allocated using the poverty incidence of 91% in the project \narea. Freight transport users include those living in the project area as \nwell  as  residents  of  Dushanbe,  with  a  lower  poverty  incidence.  The \npoverty impact ratio is estimated to be 71%. \n \nThe Project has been designed to reduce potential risks. To mitigate the \nrisk  of  implementation  delays,  the  existing  project  implementation  unit \nwill  implement  the  Project  and  has  identified  the  number  and  type  of \nadditional staff that will be hired to assist. The detailed design has been \ncompleted.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  the  Government  not  providing \ncounterpart  funds  in  a  timely  manner,  ADB  has  been  conducting \ndialogue  with \nthe  Government  and  closely  monitoring  planned \ndisbursements  under  the  Public  Investment  Program.  The  risk  of \ninadequate maintenance has been addressed through loan assurances \nrequiring  increasing  levels  of  maintenance  financing  and  through \nprocurement  of  maintenance  equipment  for  project  roads.  To  mitigate \nthe  risk  that  the  traffic  forecast  will  not  materialize,  especially  the \ninternational  generated  traffic,  it  has  been  assumed  that  full  benefits \nfrom international generated traffic will not be realized until 2012. There \nis no reason to expect that previous United Nations security restrictions \nin the project area will be reimposed. \n \nThe  proposed \nfor  Strengthening \nImplementation  of  Road  Maintenance,  for  $600,000  equivalent,  to  be \nfinanced  as  a  grant  from  ADB's  TA  funding  program,  will  develop  a \nstrategy and system of maintenance for national and secondary roads, \nmodify \nfor  national  roads,  prepare  a \nmaintenance manual for secondary roads, provide training, and conduct \npilot projects for maintenance of secondary roads. \n\nthe  maintenance  manual \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\n(TA) \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project \n(Phase I); and (ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan \nto be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development for the Project. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Implementation  of  Road \nMaintenance,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe road subsector is the most important component of domestic transport in Tajikistan. \nThe combined length of Tajikistan\u2019s road network is about 26,000 kilometers (km), consisting of \n4,700  km  of  national  roads  and  21,300  km  of  local  roads.  The  scope  of  the  network  is \nconsidered adequate to accommodate existing traffic levels and support economic growth and \nsustainable development in the medium term. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has jurisdiction \nover 13,700 km, including all of the national roads and 42% of the local roads (9,000 km). The \nremaining 12,300 km of local roads not under MOT jurisdiction are mostly rural and farm roads. \nThe major part of the network was constructed before 1970, and inadequate maintenance and \ndamage  from  civil  conflict  and  recent  natural  disasters  have  left  it  in  a  state  of  severe \ndeterioration.  Of  the  national  roads,  42%  are  asphalt,  50%  are  other  pavement,  and  8%  are \ngravel. Many of the asphalt roads are in a seriously deteriorated condition, and in many places \nthe asphalt has been worn away by years of traffic and lack of maintenance. Of the total roads \nin Tajikistan, 20% are estimated to be in fair condition, 48% in poor condition, and 32% in very \npoor condition. Practically none of the roads is estimated to be in good or very good condition. \n  \n3. \nThe  breakup  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  political  and  regional  instability  during  the \ncountry\u2019s  civil  war,  and  major  natural  disasters  severely  disrupted  economic  activities  and \ncustomary trade patterns, and resulted in a dramatic decline in transport demand after Tajikistan \ngained its independence in 1991. As Tajikistan\u2019s economy continues to grow, traffic levels are \nexpected to increase; however, it is doubtful that the traffic levels of 1990 will be reached within \nthe  next  10  years.  There  have  been  major  changes  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  vehicle  fleet  since \nindependence.  Despite  the  decrease  in  traffic  levels,  there  has  been  a  trend  of  increasing \nprivatization  of  the  road  transport  fleet  and  a  significant  increase  in  automobile  ownership.  Of \nabout  180,000  vehicles  registered  in  Tajikistan  in  2001,  cars  comprise  about  70%  and  trucks \ncomprise  about  23%.  Only  about  22%  of  vehicles  are  government-owned,  mostly  trucks,  and \nthe majority of them are more than 10 years old. \n \n4. \nADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue for the transport sector in general, \nand the road subsector in particular, since it began its involvement with the transport sector in \n1998.  The  areas  covered  by  the  policy  dialogue  include  financing  of  road  maintenance, \ncommercialization of transport services, improvement of management efficiency in the transport \nsector  by  improving  key  institutions,  separation  of  regulatory  and  operational  functions  of  the \nsector, and other areas primarily related to the transition to a market economy. Market-oriented \nthrough \nreforms \n\ntransport  sector  have  been  and  are  now  being \n\nintroduced \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nimplementation  of  the  ADB-financed  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,1  the  completed  Postconflict \nInfrastructure Program,2 and advisory TA.3 As a result of policy dialogue with and TA from ADB, \nthe administration of the transport sector was reorganized and MOT was created. MOT is now \nresponsible  for  planning  and  coordinating  all  modes  of  transport  within  the  country.  The \norganization  chart  for  MOT  is  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  In  the  future  most  state-\nowned  enterprises  will  play  a  minor  role  and  will  be  expected  to  operate  as  independent \ncommercial  enterprises.  Separate  deputy  ministers  are  responsible  for  rail  transport  and  air \ntransport. These are regulatory and oversight responsibilities only, and the line functions remain \nwith  Tajikistan  Railway  and  Tajikistan  Airlines.  MOT\u2019s  Roads  Department  is  responsible  for \nadministration,  maintenance,  and  construction  of  roads  in  Tajikistan,  and  has  a  number  of \nassociated  entities  involved  in  these  activities.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely \nderegulated;  road  haulage  organizations  enter  into  agreements  with  customers  at  negotiated \nrates. Tariffs for passenger transport are still regulated, but in practice fares vary according to \ncompetition. The project framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. A road subsector \nanalysis, including the Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan, is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nTajikistan is the poorest country among the Central Asian republics (CARs), with a per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  $166  in  2001  and  a  poverty  incidence  of  83%.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis is included in Appendix 3. Average wages are \nless than $1 per day.4 The poverty incidence in the project area is estimated at 91%. The project \nroad provides the only substantial link between the Rasht Valley and the capital Dushanbe, and \ncomprises part of an international corridor to the Kyrgyz Republic and the People's Republic of \nChina  (PRC).  The  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border  road  traverses  four  districts  with  approximately \n440,000 inhabitants, mostly living within 20 km of the road. Approximately 140,000 people will \nbe directly affected by the Project. Of these inhabitants, the majority live in rural areas where the \nincidence  of  poverty  is  particularly  severe.  The  improvement  of  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border \nroad and selected rural roads will improve access to Dushanbe and other cities in which higher \nprices are paid for agricultural products and there are more job opportunities than in the project \narea.  The  Project  will  lead  to  reduced  transport  costs,  most  of  which  will  be  passed  on  to \ntransport  users.  Numerous  agriculture  and  other  poverty  alleviation  projects  are  being \nimplemented in the project area by other international organizations, and by improving transport \nin the area the Project will maximize the benefits of these projects.  \n \n6. \nThe state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. In January 2000, the Government terminated the Road Fund to meet the International \nMonetary Fund requirement to maintain one consolidated state budget.5 The taxes and receipts \nformerly  contributing  to  the  Road  Fund  are  still  collected,  but  now  are  paid  directly  to  the \nnational  treasury.  Road  maintenance  and  construction  are  now  funded  from  the  general  state \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

Country Report No. 03/10.  \n5  The Road Fund was a first-generation fund, and did not include features such as administration by an independent \nboard found in second-generation funds. (ADB. 2003. Road Funds and Road Maintenance: An Asian Perspective. \nManila.) \n\n \n\n\f  3\n\nbudget. The following amounts (in million somoni) have been allocated to the road subsector in \nthe  national  budget  for  2003:  5.3  for  maintenance,  10.5  for  new  construction,  and  10.6  for \nrehabilitation,  for  a  total  of  26.4.  These  are  approximately  equivalent  to  the  following  amounts \n(in million dollars): 1.7 for maintenance, 3.4 for new construction, 3.4 for rehabilitation, and 8.5 \ntotal.  The  total  allocations  for  the  road  subsector  comprise  approximately  3%  of  total  planned \nGovernment expenditures for 2003. The annual requirement for maintenance of the 4,700 km of \nnational  roads  is  an  estimated  $16  million,  which  is  almost  twice  the  total  road  subsector \nbudget. \n \n7. \nMaintenance  of  the  road  network  throughout  Tajikistan  virtually  ceased  following  the \ncollapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Maintenance  funding  was  also  unavailable  during  the  civil  war, \nwhen numerous bridges and road sections were damaged. Funding for road maintenance has \ndecreased  substantially  since  independence,  and  this  inadequate  funding  is  reflected  in  the \ndeteriorated condition of the road network. Allocation of funding is often restricted to emergency \nmaintenance  needs  and  is  insufficient  for  routine  or  periodic  maintenance  requirements.  It \nappears that little preventative maintenance is currently being undertaken outside of Dushanbe \nas part of a detailed, planned, and scheduled road maintenance program. MOT is responsible \nfor planning and coordinating the maintenance of the existing road network in the country. MOT \nconducts  the  maintenance  of  roads  and  bridges  through  five  maintenance  divisions  that  are \nresponsible  for  implementing  maintenance  activities  in  their  regions.  These  five  divisions  are \nresponsible  for  maintaining  approximately  13,700  km  of  road,  and  employed  3,291  people  in \n2001. The road maintenance divisions are state entities, attached to MOT. \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Policy  Statement  outlines  the  policy  directive \nrequiring  development  of  the  transport  sector  to  be  based  on  market-oriented  reforms  and \nrestructuring  to  improve  efficiency.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  road  subsector  is  to \nrehabilitate  and  maintain  the  road  infrastructure  and  to  develop  an  efficient  road  transport \nindustry through an increased role for the private sector in providing transport services, greater \nreliance on cost recovery to finance road maintenance, and rehabilitation of the critical parts of \nthe road network and transport services that remain under state control. The Government aims \nto increase expenditures on road maintenance, and has been doing so in line with ADB's policy \ndialogue,  and  to  implement  necessary  changes  to  the  regulatory  framework  to  encourage \ngreater involvement by the private sector in road transport. The Government\u2019s strategy includes \nthe  development  of  international  road  corridors  to  facilitate  Tajikistan\u2019s  trade  with  other \ncountries. \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  its  strategy  for  the  road \n9. \nsubsector and will address the problems and opportunities related to poverty reduction and road \nmaintenance. During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its \nrequest for assistance for the Project. ADB provided TA for conducting a feasibility study for the \nProject.6 Fact-finding for the Project was conducted during 11\u201321 February 2003, and appraisal \nwas conducted during 7\u201316 June 2003. The Project was formulated based on the findings of the \nADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary  consultations,  and \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. The Project will contribute to the \nachievement of two of the objectives of ADB\u2019s Interim Operating Strategy for Tajikistan, namely, \n(i)  assisting  in  postconflict  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  (ii)  facilitating  the  country\u2019s \ntransition to a market economy. In addition, infrastructure (especially roads and power) is one of \nthe three areas on which the interim operational strategy focuses. \n \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project. Manila. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB has provided the largest amount of assistance to the road subsector of any of the \n10. \ninternational organizations (Appendix 4). The Islamic Development Bank has financed two road \nprojects  for  a  total  of  about  $19  million,  and  the  Kuwait  Fund  has  provided  about  $16  million. \nThe OPEC Fund and Saudi Fund have provided smaller amounts for road projects. The World \nBank  has  financed  infrastructure  rehabilitation  projects  that  include  roads  as  well  as  other \ninfrastructure. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in \ngeneral, ADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Tajikistan, and other projects and TAs in the CARs. \nOne  of  the  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  impact  evaluation  study  on  rural  roads  and  poverty \nreduction7 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened by neglecting road \nmaintenance.  The  study  recommends  devolving  responsibility  for  road  maintenance  to  local \ncommunities,  particularly  for  rural  roads,  as  a  means  of  ensuring  long-term  sustainability.  The \nProject  is  addressing  the  importance  of  road  maintenance  in  general  through  loan  covenants \nrequiring  specified  levels  of  financing  for  road  maintenance  (for  the  national  road  network  as \nwell  as  for  project  roads)  and  purchasing  maintenance  equipment  to  be  used  on  the  project \nroads. In addition, the advisory TA associated with the project will be developing a maintenance \nsystem for rural roads, including community-based maintenance. \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s TA Performance Audit Report on Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to \nthe  Road  Sector  in  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Mongolia8  found  that  the  scope  of  TAs \nshould be achievable within the given timeframe. The report also found that there is a need to \nincrease  expenditures  on  road  maintenance  in  the  three  CARs  on  which  it  focused.  These \nrecommendations  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design  through  (i)  providing  a  24-\nmonth  duration  for  implementation  of  the  advisory  TA,  and  (ii)  including  loan  assurances  to \nincrease financing for road maintenance (para 58 [iii]). \n \n13. \nADB is currently implementing the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1) in Tajikistan. \nAlthough  this  project  is  still  under  implementation,  some  lessons  may  be  learned.  The  Road \nRehabilitation  Project  has  experienced  some  delays  in  implementation,  although  it  is  now \nproceeding without  problems.  The  delays  were  mainly  due  to  (i)  lack  of  advance  procurement \naction, (ii) a delay in declaring the loan effective, and (iii) the detailed design being prepared by \nthe supervision consultants under the project. Since there was no advance action under the first \nproject,  the  supervision  consultants  (who  were  to  prepare  the  detailed  design)  could  not  be \nrecruited until the loan had been declared effective. The delays in loan effectiveness therefore \nled  to  further  delays  in  preparing  the  detailed  design  and  procurement  of  the  civil  works.  A \nlesson  related  to  the  policy  dialogue  from  the  ongoing  project  is  that  funding  of  road \nmaintenance  remains  a  problem  given  the  difficult  fiscal  situation  in  Tajikistan.  These  lessons \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  Advance  action  for  the  proposed  Project  was \napproved  at  the  Management  Review  Meeting  and  is  under  way,  and  the  detailed  design  has \nbeen  completed.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  implementing  the  ongoing  project  is \nfunctioning  well,  and  will  implement  the  proposed  Project  (with  the  assistance  of  additional \nstaff).  Finally,  the  Government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  loan  assurances  that  will  provide \nadequate  financing  to  maintain  the  roads  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  as  well  as  significant \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

The program completion report for the program loan (footnote 2) found that, \nwhile  there  were  substantial  achievements,  the  extensive  program  of  policy  reforms  in  the \ntransport  and  energy  sectors  was  too  ambitious.9  The  primary  lesson  learned  was  that \ncovenants should be tailored to the capability of a country to achieve them. To incorporate this \nlesson, the policy reform agenda of the proposed Project focuses on one crucial area, financing \nof road maintenance, and the Government and ADB carried out an extensive dialogue to ensure \nthat Tajikistan is capable of implementing the loan assurances.  \n \nD. \n  \n15. \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  a  key  national  and  international  transport  corridor  in \nTajikistan. The project road provides the primary link between Dushanbe and the Rasht Valley, \nto the northeast. For several months during the winter, the road also serves as a link between \nthe northern Sugdh region and the rest of Tajikistan. The project area was the scene of heavy \nfighting during Tajikistan\u2019s civil war in the mid-1990s and has a poverty incidence of 91%. The \nimprovement of the rural roads will improve access to the main road for poor villages not located \non the main road, and therefore improve access to regional markets and Dushanbe. Numerous \nagriculture and other poverty alleviation projects are being implemented in the project area by \nother international organizations, and by improving transport in the area the Project will enable \nthe full potential of these projects to be realized. The Project will facilitate national development \nand regional cooperation by rehabilitating the corridor connecting Afghanistan and Tajikistan to \nthe PRC and other countries in the region. The project road eventually connects to Sary Tash in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and to the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road corridor currently being studied \nunder  ADB's  TA  for  Regional  Cooperation  in  Transport  Projects  in  Central  Asia.10  The  Project \nwill address the national problem of road maintenance by increasing financing for maintenance \nof  national  roads  and  developing  a  maintenance  system  for  rural  roads.  The  Project  supports \nthe  strategy  of  the  Government  and  ADB  to  rehabilitate  infrastructure  and  to  develop \ninternational  transport  corridors.  The  second  phase  of  the  rehabilitation  of  the  road  from \nDushanbe to the Kyrgyz border is included in ADB's Tajikistan program as a firm loan for 2005. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nThe objective of the Project is reduce poverty, by reducing the cost of road transport and \nimproving  access  to  markets,  and  to  increase  regional  trade  and  cooperation  by  rehabilitating \nthe  road  linking  Dushanbe  to  Nurobod  (Darband)  in  the  Rasht  Valley  and  on  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  and  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  (i)  reduce  transport  costs  on  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz \nborder  road;  (ii)  provide  agricultural  and  industrial  enterprises  with  all-weather  access  to \nmarkets  within  the  country,  and  eventually  abroad;  (iii)  improve  access  of  the  rural  poor \npopulation to market opportunities, other economic activities, and social services by improving \nrural  roads;  and  (iv)  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s  institutional  capacities  for  efficient \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002.

The  condition  of  the  road  varies  widely  depending  on  past \nmaintenance activity and geological conditions. The conditions on the km 22\u201395 section range \nfrom  areas  in  which  only  the  surface  pavement  has  deteriorated  to  areas  requiring \nreconstruction.  The  works  on  this  section  include  reconstruction  work  in  a  landslide  area, \nrehabilitation of substantially deteriorated asphalt surfaces, and surface treatment of pavement \nin  some  locations.  The  km  95\u2013150  section  passes  through  mountainous  terrain  and  has  not \nbeen maintained. On this section, the Project will complete minor rehabilitation works, such as \ninstallation  of  slope  protection  and  safety  facilities,  as  well  as  maintenance  activities  including \nwork  to  prevent  further  major  rock  falls.  The  minor  works  on  the  km  9\u201322  section  comprise \nroutine maintenance activities only. The conditions of the rural roads vary by location, and the \nworks on these roads will include machine grading, profiling of gravel roads, repair of potholes, \nand patching of asphalt surfaces. In addition, five seriously deteriorated bridges will be replaced. \nAll  the  project  works  have  been  designed  to  comply  with  the  highway  design  standards \ndeveloped  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  road  design  standards  in  the  CARs.11  The  maintenance \nequipment procured under the Project will become the property of MOT and will be distributed to \nroad maintenance units. \n \n19. \nof national and rural roads (paras. 41\u201343).  \n \nC. \n \n\nIn addition, an accompanying advisory TA will be provided to improve the maintenance \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nMaximizing Poverty Impact \n\n \n20. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact  through \nimproving  rural  roads  and  encouraging  the  hiring  of  poor  residents  and  women  in  the  project \narea to work on the Project. The improvement of the rural roads will expand the benefits of the \nrehabilitation  of  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border  road  to  poor  villages  located  in  the  project  area \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997.

The  77  km  of \nrural roads included in the Project were selected based on the following criteria: (i) geographic \nlocation,  (ii)  poverty  and  social  considerations,  (iii)  economic  and  traffic  criteria,  (iv) \nsustainability, and (v) opportunities for cooperation with other poverty-alleviation projects in the \narea. During the selection process, discussions were held with MOT, local government officials, \nand residents of rural villages. Improvement of rural roads will provide these poor villages with \nimproved access to the main highway, and thus improved access to markets and urban areas. \nThe improvement of the rural roads as well as the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road will lower the \ncosts of transporting agricultural inputs to the poor areas and transporting agricultural outputs to \nmarkets, thereby improving the terms of trade for poor farmers in the project area. Improvement \nof  the  rural roads  will  also  improve  access  to job  opportunities  in  Dushanbe  and  elsewhere  in \nthe project area. Access to social services will also be improved; for example, ambulances are \nno longer operated in some areas because of the poor quality of the roads. \n \n21. \nThe poverty impact of the Project will also be maximized through complementarity with \nother  poverty-reduction  projects.  A  large  number  of  income-generating  projects,  especially  in \nthe  agriculture  sector,  are  being  implemented  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  and \nother  development  agencies  in  the  project  area.  The  Cooperative  for  Assistance  and  Relief \nEverywhere,  Inc.  (CARE)  International's  Women\u2019s  Economic  Opportunity  Project  in  Vahdat \n(Kofarnikhon) and other areas has helped form women's groups and federations and provided \nthem  with  credit  totaling  about  TJS200,000  for  income-generating  activities  including  poultry \nproduction and livestock raising. The CARE project has also provided training to women in other \nincome-generating  activities  such  as  sewing,  knitting,  and  production  of  baskets.  ADB\u2019s \nTajikistan  Rural  Poverty  Reduction  Project,12  under  implementation  by  CARE  International  in \nVahdat and other areas, has helped more than 100 farmers\u2019 associations and women\u2019s groups \nand has provided about TJS300,000 of credit to these organizations for purchasing agricultural \ninputs  and  livestock.  This  project  is  also  funding  irrigation  projects  and  providing  agricultural \ntechnical  training.  German  Agro  Action  is  implementing  the  Seed  and  Fertilizer  Agricultural \nRehabilitation  Project,  funded  by  the  European  Commission,  which  provides  farmers  in \nFaisabod, Nurobod, Vahdat, and other areas, with high-quality seeds on a reimbursable basis. \nA representative list of other income-generating projects is included in Supplementary Appendix \nB. By lowering transport costs and improving access to markets, the Project\u2019s rehabilitation of \nthe Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road and rural roads will maximize the income received from the \ngoods produced with the assistance of these income-generating projects in the project area. \n \n22. \nThe Project will encourage the hiring of poor people from the project area for unskilled \nand  semi-skilled  labor.  The  Project  will  also  encourage  the  hiring  of  women  who  head \nhouseholds, especially those whose husbands were killed or severely disabled in the civil war, \nas  well  as  disadvantaged  women  in  general.  While  the  employment  opportunities  from  the \nProject will only yield short-term direct benefits to the poor, the indirect impacts on poverty will \nbe  longer-term.  According  to  surveys  conducted  by  the  TA  consultants  and  the  project-\nprocessing missions, about two thirds of the residents of the communities on the rural roads to \nbe rehabilitated under the Project are indebted, and the income from employment can be used \nto pay off these debts. The residents also indicated that they would use the income from short-\nterm  employment  to  invest  in  income-generating  activities  such  as  processing  of  locally-\nproduced fruit and dairy products and purchase of livestock. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Rural Poverty Reduction Project. Manila. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Dialogue and Road Maintenance Financing \n\n \n23. \nADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue for the transport sector in general, \nand  the  road  subsector  in  particular,  since  it  began  its  involvement  with  Tajikistan's  transport \nsector in 1998. Financing of road maintenance is one of the key topics that has been addressed \nin the policy dialogue. As part of the covenants for the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1), \nthe  Government  agreed  to  increase  budget  allocations  for  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of \nroads  under  MOT  administration  by  10%  per  year  plus  inflation  during  2002  to  2004.  The \nGovernment  has  complied  with  the  required  10%  annual  increase  (plus  inflation)  in  budget \nallocations  for  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.13  Allocations  for  road  maintenance  have \nincreased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  29%  since  2001.  The  Government  also  agreed  that \nfunding  for  road  maintenance  would  account  for  50%,  60%,  and  65%  of  the  total  budget \nallocation  for  road  maintenance  and  new  construction  in  the  years  2001,  2002,  and  2003, \nrespectively.  According  to  budget  data  provided  by  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF), \nbudget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  have  accounted  for  57%,  36%,  and  60%  of  the  total \nbudget  allocation  for  road  maintenance  and  new  construction  in  2001,  2002,  and  2003, \nrespectively.  The  Government  thus  exceeded  the  covenant  in  2001,  fell  substantially  short  in \n2002,  and  failed  to  comply  by  a  small  amount  in  2003.  The  failures  to  comply  are  due  to \nsubstantial  increases  in  spending  on  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel  (a  national  priority \nproject) in 2002 and 2003. The Government requested a modification of the requirement for the \nmaintenance financing proportion for 2004 (70%) so that it is consistent with the assurances for \n2005\u20132007 in the proposed Project (para. 24). ADB approved the request. \n \n24. \nFor  the  proposed  Project,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  ensure  that  annual  budget \nallocations  and  actual  expenditures  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  (excluding  new \nconstruction) of roads under MOT\u2019s jurisdiction will be increased by no less than 15% per year \nin 2005\u20132007. Based on the amount allocated for road rehabilitation and maintenance in 2003, \nthis covenant will result in expenditures on road rehabilitation and maintenance reaching TJS28 \nmillion  (approximately  $9  million)  in  2007.    The  Government  will  also  establish  a  separate \nbudget  item  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border  road.  The \nGovernment  will  allocate  $40,000  per  year  (plus  inflation  since  2003)  for  maintenance  of  the \nrehabilitated sections of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road, following handover of these sections \nby the contractor. The Government will also ensure that the rural roads rehabilitated under the \nProject  are  adequately  maintained.  Furthermore,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  actual \nexpenditures  for  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  will  account  for  no  less  than  80%  of  the \ntotal budget allocation for road maintenance and rehabilitation and new construction (excluding \nexpenditures  for  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel)  during  2005\u20132007.  This  differs  from  the \ncovenant  under  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  by  excluding  expenditures  for  the  Anzob \nTunnel.  The  Government  considers  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel  to  be  a  national  priority \nproject, and is actively seeking grant financing from bilateral sources. ADB's policy dialogue on \nroad maintenance financing will ensure the maintenance and sustainability of roads rehabilitated \nunder  the  Project,  and  will  also  increase  overall  financing  for  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, to the extent possible given fiscal constraints and the national priority project. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  intensive  policy  dialogue  on  financing  of  road  maintenance,  ADB\u2019s \n25. \npolicy  dialogue  for  the  transport  sector  in  general  has  covered  all  subsectors  and  numerous \nissues.  The  covenants  for  the  ongoing  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  1)  include  a \nnumber  of  covenants  that  were  originally  part  of  the  Postconflict  Infrastructure  Program \n\n                                                 \n13 Inflation rates were 38.6% and 12.2% in 2001 and 2002, respectively.

While the Government has complied with a number of these covenants, particularly \nthose  related  to  implementation  of  the  Transport  Law,  the  Government  has  not  fully  complied \nwith  four  covenants,  relating  primarily  to  corporatization  of  the  railway  and  aviation  sectors, \nalthough progress has been made towards compliance with these as well. The Government, in \na  letter  of  6  October  2003,  formally  requested  modifications  and  waivers  of  the  outstanding \ncovenants.  In  particular,  the  Government  requested  an  extension  of  the  dates  for  compliance \nwith  two  outstanding  covenants  related  to  Tajik  Rail  and  waivers  of  two  other  outstanding \ncovenants,  which  are  the  subject  of  policy  dialogue  with  other  international  organizations  as \ndiscussed in Appendix 2. ADB has approved the Government's request. \n \n26. \nIn  addition  to  increasing  financing  for  road  maintenance,  ADB  has  also  focused  on \nimproving  the  Government\u2019s  technical  capacity  for  conducting  road  maintenance.  Road \nmaintenance equipment is being procured under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1), and \nadditional  maintenance  equipment  will  be  procured  under  the  proposed  Project.  A  manual  for \nroutine maintenance of national roads was developed under ADB TA,14 and will be updated under \nthe  proposed  advisory  TA  (paras.  41\u201343).  The  Project  will  also  address  maintenance  of \nsecondary  roads.  The  advisory  TA  will  develop  a  manual  for  maintenance  of  secondary  roads \nincluding  a  community-based  maintenance  system.  The  TA  also  includes  training  of  road \nmaintenance  personnel  and  implementation  of  pilot  projects  to  maintain  the  rural  roads.  The \nmaintenance equipment procured under the Project will also be used to maintain the rural roads \nrehabilitated under the Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n \nThe  Project  is  also  important  from  a  regional  perspective  and  contributes  to  ADB\u2019s \n27. \nregional  cooperation  strategy  in  Central  Asia.  After  reaching  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  road  leads  directly  to  Sary  Tash.  Sary  Tash  is  on  the  Osh-Sary  Tash-Irkeshtam \nroad  corridor,  which  links  Uzbekistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  the  PRC.  This  corridor  is \ncurrently  being  studied  under  TA  6024-REG:  Regional  Cooperation  in  Transport  Projects  in \nCentral  Asia  (footnote  10),  and  is  part  of  the  larger  corridor  connecting  to  Tashkent  in \nUzbekistan (408 km west of Osh), and to Kashgar in the PRC (240 km east of Irkeshtam). The \nrehabilitation of the first phase of the Osh-Sary Tash-Irkeshtam road is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 \nprogram for the Kyrygz Republic. \n \n28. \nTo the south of Dushanbe, the Project connects with ADB\u2019s Road Rehabilitation Project \n(footnote  1),  which  is  rehabilitating  sections  of  the  Dushanbe-Kurgan  Tyube-Dangara-Khulyab \nroad.  From  Kurgan  Tyube,  there  is  a  road  to  the  border  of  Afghanistan.  The  United  States \nGovernment has agreed to finance a bridge across the Pyanzh River, connecting Tajikistan to \nAfghanistan. Thus, the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road to be improved by the Project forms part \nof  the  corridor  that  will  eventually  link  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  to  the  PRC,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and other countries in the region. \n \nD. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $23.6  million  equivalent  (including  physical \n29. \ncontingencies,  price  escalation,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction)  of  which \n$16.8  million  (71.2%)  is  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.8 \nmillion  equivalent,  or  about  28.8%  of  the  total  cost.  Local  taxes  are  not  included  in  the  cost \n\nCost Estimates \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1999.

The  ADB  loan  will  represent  63.6%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including \ncontingencies and interest charge on the loan during construction. The terms and conditions of \nthe loan will be ADB\u2019s standard terms and conditions for loans from its Asian Development Fund \nresources. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the \nremaining period. The Government and cofinancier will finance the remaining foreign and entire \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  OPEC  Fund  will  provide  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $6.0  million  to \nfinance  the  foreign  exchange  and  local  currency  cost  of  the  civil  works  on  a  joint  basis  with \nADB.15 The OPEC Fund cofinancing will have a maturity of 20 years, including a grace period of \n5 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum, and a service charge of 1% per annum. In the event \nthat cofinancing is not available, the Government and ADB will agree on reductions to the scope \nof  work  sufficient  to  cover  the  shortfall.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan.  The \nGovernment  has  given  its  assurance  that  adequate  local  counterpart  funds  will  be  made \navailable  from  the  State  Budget  or  other  sources  as  necessary  to  enable  the  Project  to  be \nimplemented in a timely manner. MOF assured the Mission that it would be able to provide the \nrequired  counterpart  funds  for  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  1)  and  the  proposed \nProject  simultaneously.  In  case  of  escalation  of  prices  or  required  quantities  covered  by \ncontingencies,  the  increase  will  be  split  between  the  Government  and  ADB  according  to  the \nfinancing percentages of the overall project costs, subject always to the maximum loan amount. \nThe proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and shown in Appendix 5. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The OPEC Fund cofinancing is scheduled for consideration by the OPEC Fund Board in December 2003. \n\n \n\n\f  11\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign \nExchange\n14.4 \n \n0.3 \n \n \n2.1 \n16.8 \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.6  \n \n2.3 \n \n3.9 \n \n6.8 \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n15.0 \n2.6 \n6.0 \n23.6 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nPercent of \nProject Cost \n63.6 \n \n11.0 \n \n25.4 \n \n100.0 \n \n\n \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nOPEC Fund \nTotal \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nOrganization and Management \n\n \nThe organizational arrangement existing under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote \n31. \n1) will remain effective for the proposed Project. The deputy minister of MOT will have overall \nresponsibility  for  project  management,  including  approval  of  contracts  and  payments.  The \nexisting  PIU  will  (i)  monitor  the  progress  of  day-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare \nwithdrawal applications, (iii) prepare project progress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts \nand  complete  loan  financial  records  for  auditing  the  Project.  The  executive  project  director, \nacceptable to ADB, with adequate experience in project management, will be responsible for the \nday-to-day  supervision  of  implementation  activities.  The  executive  project  director  will  be \nsupported by a group of professional and clerical staff with expertise and experience in financial \naccounting, \nroad  engineering,  construction  supervision,  contract  administration,  and \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans.  Four  additional  staff  will  be  added  to  the  PIU  to  ensure \nthat it has sufficient capacity to implement both ADB road projects simultaneously.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n32. \nThe Project will be implemented in 3.3 years from September 2004 to December 2007 \nincluding  mobilization  but  excluding  the  defects  liability  period  (the  period  during  which  the \ncontractor is responsible for maintenance). The civil works for the project road are scheduled to \nbegin  in  October  2004  and  be  completed  in  December  2007.  The  proposed  implementation \nschedule is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n33. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $1.0 \nmillion  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply \ncontracts  not  exceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Civil  works \nfor  rehabilitation  of  the  Vahdat-Faisabod-Obigarm  sections  (km  22\u201395)  have  been  packaged \ninto  one  contract,  which  will  be  financed  jointly  by  ADB  and  the  OPEC  Fund  following \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  to  encourage  participation  of  international \ncompetitors and joint ventures by international and domestic contractors. Civil works for the km \n9\u201322  and  km  95\u2013150  sections  and  the  rural  road  improvement  component  will  be  procured \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  to  maximize  the  use  of  local  labor.  Supply  contracts  for  the \nequipment will be packaged based on the technical requirements of the equipment and will be \nfinalized  during  project  implementation.  Tentative  contract  packages  are  listed  in  Appendix  7. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n \n\nAdvance procurement action was approved by ADB at the Management Review Meeting on 14 \nMay 2003 and is now under way. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n34. \nInternational  consulting  services  for  44  person-months  will  be  provided  by  a  firm,  for \nconstruction supervision, project impact monitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures \nto  improve  road  safety,  auditing,  and  project  management.  The  international  consultants  will \nalso provide on-the-job training to the counterpart staff and domestic consultants. In association \nwith the international consultants, domestic consulting services totaling 300 person-months will \nbe  provided  for  construction  supervision,  contract  management  and  other  technical  advisory \nassistance;  as  well  as  for  helping  the  international  consultants  monitor  the  social  and  poverty \nimpact  of  the  Project  through  household  surveys  and  data  analysis.  Sufficient  domestic \nconsulting services are available in Tajikistan. The consultants to be financed under the loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A \nfull  technical  proposal  will  be  required  for  the  consulting  services,  and  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection method will be used in selecting the consultants. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are given in Appendix 8. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n35. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  (i)  a  direct  payment \nprocedure, (ii) a commitment procedure, or (iii) a reimbursement procedure.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \nIn  view  of  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the  Project  by  the  Government  and  in  order  to \n36. \nminimize  implementation  delays  and  ensure  the  timely  completion  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment requested ADB approval for advance procurement action for civil works packages \nand advance recruitment action for international consultants. The advance actions, up to but not \nincluding  signing  of  contracts,  will  cover  (i)  prequalification  of  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid \nevaluation for the civil works contract packages; and (ii) recruitment of international consultants \nto help implement the Project. ADB approved advance procurement action at the Management \nReview  Meeting  on  14  May  2003.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB's  approval  of \nthe advance actions does not commit ADB to approve the Project or finance any procurement \ncosts. \n \n\n7. \n\nMidterm Review \n\n \n37. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  in \n2005.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and  poverty \nreduction. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non project performance  will also be assessed during the review. The review  will also examine \nthe implementation progress for the policy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in \nthe Loan Agreement. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f  13\n\n8. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit \n\n \n38.  MOT will prepare and submit to ADB and the cofinancier monthly, quarterly, and annual \nprogress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with \nADB.  MOT  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  all  project  components  financed  by  ADB,  the \ncofinancier,  and  the  Government  and  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has \nadequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices and is acceptable to \nADB. The audited Project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be furnished to ADB within 9 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  The  Government  has  been  informed  of  ADB\u2019s \nrequirement  on  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements, \nincluding \nfacilitate \npostevaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to provide a project completion report \nto ADB, within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\nthe  suspension  of  disbursements \n\nin  case  of  noncompliance.  To \n\n9. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nA  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  performance  of  the \n39. \nProject in relation to its goals and purposes, with an emphasis on poverty reduction, has been \nagreed  upon  with  MOT.  A  draft  project  performance  management  system  containing  these \nindicators  is  included  in  Appendix  9,  with  data  for  the  monitoring  indicators  included  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  MOT  will  confirm \nbaseline  values  for  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  indicators.  Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  measured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  implementation. \nComments  and  findings  regarding  these  project  indicators  will  be  incorporated  in  every  other \nquarterly  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for \nproject evaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  Participatory  surveys  will  take  place  and \nresults will be compared with the baseline. A final report will consist of an evaluation of changes \nthat  occurred  in  the  preceding  3  years.  MOT  has  developed  its  monitoring  capability  for  the \nongoing  project,  and  has  the  capacity  to  monitor  the  proposed  Project  as  well.  In  addition,  to \nfacilitate  assessment  of  the  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  an \ninternational consultant will be recruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n40. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  the  officials  of  the  Government  during \nproject  processing.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption-free \nenvironment, and has agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nin preparing all documents and contracts during the bidding process and during implementation \nof the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  an  advisory  and  operational  TA16  to \n41. \ndevelop a strategy for and system of maintenance for national and secondary roads, including a \nsystem of community-based maintenance for rural roads. The TA will require approximately 20 \nperson-months  of  international  and  60  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services,  with \nexpertise  in  maintenance  of  national  and  secondary  roads  and  development  of  community-\nbased  maintenance  systems,  technical  training,  and  working  with  NGOs.  Draft  terms  of \n\n                                                 \n16 The proposed TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 24 April 2003. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n \n\nreference for the TA are included in Appendix 10. It will be recommended that the consultants \nconsider  using  NGOs  to  perform  some  of  the  domestic  consulting  services  related  to \nmaintenance of secondary roads. \n  \nThe total TA cost is estimated to be $706,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange \n42. \ncost  of  $427,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $279,000  equivalent.  A  TA  grant  of  $600,000 \nequivalent is proposed for ADB financing to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $427,000 \nand $173,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  The  remaining  local  cost  of  $106,000  equivalent  will  be \nfinanced by the Government. \n \n43.  \u041c\u041e\u0422 will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for the day-to-day \nimplementation  activities,  including  liaison  and  coordination  with  other  concerned  Government \ndepartments  or  agencies.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  24  months  beginning  in  April  2005. \nThe TA is expected to be completed by 31 March 2007. A simplified technical proposal will be \nrequired for the consulting services, and the consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \u0410D\u0412\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \n44. \nTraffic  forecasts  were  prepared  for  the  sections  of  the  project  road  based  on  forecast \nGDP  growth,  population  growth,  and  income  elasticities  of  demand  during  2003\u20132027 \n(Appendix  11).  GDP  is  forecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  5%  through  2012  and  4%  for  the \nremainder  of  the  project  period,  and  population  is  expected  to  increase  at  an  average  annual \ngrowth rate of 1.6% per year during the project period. Average annual traffic growth rates for \ntrucks, buses, and cars are estimated at 6.5%, 4.6% and 6.3%, respectively, during 2003\u20132012, \nand  4.0%,  3.5%,  and  4.7%  for  the  remainder  of  the  project  period.  In  2027,  total  vehicles  per \nday  are  forecast  to  range  from  19,839  on  the  Dushanbe-Vahdat  section  to  4,922  on  the \nObigarm-Nurobod section. International generated traffic, arising from increased trade between \nTajikistan and the PRC, is expected to start in 2010 following completion of other road projects, \nto reach full levels in 2012, and to comprise 61%\u201372% of total traffic in 2027 except for 14% on \nthe  Dushanbe-Vahdat  section.  At  present,  about  50%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  imports  from  the  PRC \nconsist  of  fabric,  chemicals,  cotton, and  tea;  while  cotton  comprises  about  70%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s \nexports  to  the  PRC.  Trade  between  the  two  countries  is  expected  to  increase  following  the \ncompletion of other road projects and associated cross-border trade agreements. In particular, \nthe PRC is expected to provide a large market for Tajikistan\u2019s agricultural output and to become \na large source of consumer goods for Tajikistan. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Distribution Analysis \n\n \n45. \nThe economic analysis was carried out for each section of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border \nroad and the rural roads included in the Project on the basis of a comparison of the with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  receive  only \nminimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-project scenario assumes that, \nfollowing  completion  of  the  Project,  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  will  be  carried  out \naccording  to  international  standards.  During  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  6),  various \n\n \n\n\f  15\n\ninclude \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\nproject design alternatives were considered, and the project design is based on the least cost \noption. \n \n46. \nimprovement  and \nmaintenance,  including  rural  road  improvement,  maintenance  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices.  The  quantifiable  economic  benefits  from  the  Project  include  savings  in  vehicle \noperating  costs  (VOCs),  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  time  savings  for \npassenger travel, and poverty alleviation benefits. Economic benefits were calculated applying \nthe same methodology used for costs. Domestic generated traffic comprises new traffic induced \nfrom  the  reduction  in  VOCs  as  a  result  of  the  improvement  of  the  road,  and  the  benefits  are \ncalculated  using  50%  of  the  VOC  savings  for  existing  traffic.  International  generated  traffic \narises  from  increased  trade  between  Tajikistan  and  the  PRC.  These  benefits  will  not  begin  to \naccrue until 2010, following completion of other sections of the road to the PRC, and will not be \nfully  realized  until  2012.  Poverty  alleviation  benefits  arise  from  the  increased  prices  for \nagricultural products that will be realized by poor households in the project area. The Project will \nlead  to  higher  prices  for  the  products  as  the  improvement  of  the  project  roads  facilitates  the \nshipment  of  goods  to  Dushanbe  and  other  markets  as  well  as  increased  travel  to  the  project \narea  by  traders  buying  produce  to  sell  elsewhere.  VOC  savings  for  existing  traffic  and \ninternational generated traffic are the most significant sources of benefits, accounting for about \n53%  and  37%  of  total  benefits,  respectively.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  which \ncannot  be  quantified  due  to  insufficient  information.  These  include  improved  access  to  health \nand  other  social  services,  improved  access  to  Dushanbe  and  other  areas  with  more \nemployment opportunities, and improved road safety. \n \nEconomic internal rates of return (EIRR) and net present values were calculated for the \n47. \nfour sections of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road, for the combined group of rural roads, and \nfor  the  overall  Project  (Appendix  12).  The  EIRR  for  the  overall  Project  is  15.8%,  and  the  net \npresent  value  is  $6.4  million.  The  EIRRs  for  the  four  sections  of  the  main  road  and  the  rural \nroads  component  range  from  12.0%  to  32.3%.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the \neffects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the \nProject.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  42%  or \nbenefits  would  have  to  decrease  by  29%  for  the  EIRR  to  decline  to  the  cutoff  level  of  12%. \nGiven  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  other  road  improvement  projects  in  the  CARs,  changes  of  such \nmagnitude are not expected to occur. \n \n48. \nDistribution  analysis  was  carried  out  in  order  to  examine  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  the \npoor.  Net  project  benefits  were  distributed  among  (i)  users  of  freight  transport,  (ii)  users  of \npassenger  transport,  (iii)  vehicle  owners,  (iv)  labor,  and  (v)  the  government  and  economy  of \nTajikistan.  Although  bus  fares  are  formally  regulated,  there  appears  to  be  free  competition \namong operators in the project area. Therefore, it is assumed that savings in VOCs for buses on \nthe  project  road  will  be  passed  on  as  lower  fares.  As  the  trucking  industry  in  Tajikistan  is \ndominated  by  the  private  sector,  and  there  is  a  high  level  of  competition  on  the  project  road, \nmost  of  the  reduction  in  VOCs  is  likely  to  be  passed  on  to  users  as  lower  transport  charges. \nTherefore,  most  of  the  benefits  from  VOC  savings  are  also  passed  on  to  transport  users. \nInternational  generated  traffic  arises  from  increased  trade,  and  these  benefits  are  allocated  to \nthe  economy  in  general.  The  largest  beneficiaries  were  users  of  freight  transport,  followed  by \nusers of passenger transport. \n \n \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nB. \n \n49. \nThe  main  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  are  unemployment  and  the  low  prices \nreceived for agricultural produce. The Project will contribute to poverty alleviation by addressing \nboth of these causes (paras. 20\u201322). The improvement of the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz border road as \nwell  as  the  rural  roads  will  improve  access  to  Dushanbe  and  other  locations  in  which  higher \nprices are paid for agricultural products and there are more job opportunities than in the project \narea.  Reductions  in  transport  costs  will  be  passed  on  to  the  users  of  the  transport  services, \nthereby improving the terms of trade for poor farmers in the project area by lowering the costs of \nagricultural  inputs  and  increasing  prices  for  agricultural  outputs.  In  addition,  the  improved \ntransport  services  should  increase  the  number  of  traders  traveling  to  the  project  area  to  buy \nproduce. Many other income generating projects are being implemented by other agencies and \ninternational organizations in the project area, and the improved transport from the Project will \nenable  the  full  potential  of  these  other  projects  to  be  realized.  The  Project\u2019s  civil  works  will \nrequire  approximately  4,400  person-months  of  unskilled  labor.  The  Project  will  encourage \ncontractors to hire poor residents of the project area to fill these unskilled labor positions. \n \n50. \nThe  poverty  impact  ratio  has  been  calculated  to  illustrate  the  poverty  impact  of  the \nProject. The proportion of benefits accruing to the poor has been estimated for all the benefits \nallocated  by  the  distribution  analysis.  Benefits  to  freight  and  passenger  transport  users  have \nbeen allocated according to the proportion of transport users that are poor. Users of passenger \ntransport services will primarily be residents of the project area, and benefits are allocated using \nthe poverty incidence of 91% in the project area. Some freight transport users will be residents \nof  Dushanbe,  which  has  a  lower  poverty  incidence.  Therefore,  an  estimated  83%  (national \npoverty  incidence)  of  road  freight  users  will  be  poor.  It  is  assumed  that  only  5%  of  vehicle \nowners are poor and benefits to the poor were allocated accordingly. The poverty impact ratio is \nestimated  to  be  0.71,  meaning  that  71%  of  the  Project's  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  poor.  The \nProject  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  based  on  the  proportion  of  poor  among  the \nbeneficiaries, the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor, and the positive impact it will have \non other poverty-alleviation projects in the project area. \n \nC. \n \n51. \nKey  social  issues  were  analyzed  during  the  social  analysis  conducted  as  part  of  the \nproject  preparatory  TA  (footnote  6)  and  further  developed  during  project  processing  missions. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  particular  adverse  impact  on  vulnerable  groups  and  no  negative \nimplication  for  gender  concerns  or  indigenous  people.  No  resettlement  activities  will  be \nnecessary  and  there  will  be  no  resettlement  effects.  The  project  activities  will  occur  within  the \nexisting alignment or on land owned by the Government.  \n \nThe proposed project design was discussed in detail with local government officials and \n52. \nrepresentatives of the affected communities. The project preparatory TA consultants conducted \na  detailed  survey  of  768  households  in  the  project  area.  The  communities  are  aware  of  the \nproposed  Project  and  of  the  implications  for  their  welfare.  The  Government  agreed  to  ensure \nthat  the  Project  is  implemented,  to  the  extent  possible,  with  active  participation  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries,  using  participatory  practices,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  handbook,  Mainstreaming \nParticipatory Development Processes. \n \n \n \n\nSocial Impact and Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\n \n\n\f  17\n\nRoad Safety \n\nThe  project  classification \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nis  environment  category  B.  An \n\nD. \n \n53. \ninitial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out under the project preparatory TA (footnote 6) in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Review \nProcedures,  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  IEE \nindicates that there will be no major adverse environmental impact because the Project involves \nmainly  rehabilitation  of  roads  on  the  existing  alignment  (except  for  minor  realignments  due  to \ndifficult geotechnical conditions). The summary IEE is included in Appendix 13. \n \nE. \n \nThe Transport Safety Section of MOT\u2019s Transport Policy Department is responsible for \n54. \nthe  physical  aspects  of  road  safety,  including  road  conditions,  signs,  etc.  According  to  data \ncollected by ADB\u2019s TA for Regional Road Safety Initiatives,17 Tajikistan\u2019s road safety record in \nthe  mid-1990s  was  very  poor,  with a  fatality  rate  of  407  per  10,000  vehicles.  However,  recent \ndata  from  MOT  indicate  that  the  situation  has  improved.  Although  the  number  of  vehicles  has \nincreased  substantially,  the  number  of  road  accidents  and  fatalities  has  remained  relatively \nstable, with a resulting fatality rate in 2001 of 23 per 10,000 vehicles. The improvement is due to \nimplementation  of  MOT\u2019s  Accident  Prevention  Plan,  under  which  approximately  30  indicators \nare monitored annually. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  includes  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety.  The  rehabilitation \nworks will result in substantial improvement of road safety. Work activities with particular impact \non  safety  include  installation  of  safety  facilities,  e.g.,  barriers,  on  the  mountainous  km  95\u2013150 \nsection, improvement of the road surface in areas in which the extensive deterioration results in \nunsafe  driving  conditions,  and  the  replacement  of  five  deteriorated  bridges  on  the rural  roads, \nwhich is also required for traffic safety. The consulting services include one person-month for an \ninternational  road  safety  expert,  whose  tasks  will  include  conducting  a  road  safety  audit, \nadvising  MOT  on  enforcement  measures  for  the  road  safety  action  plan,  and  providing  TA  for \nincorporating  road-safety  features  in  the  project  design.  Domestic  consulting  services  will  also \nbe allocated to road safety. \n \nF. \n \n56. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which  include  delays  in \nimplementation  due  to  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  failure  to \nprovide  counterpart  financing  in  a  timely  manner,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized, \ninadequate road maintenance, and political instability in the project area. The Project includes a \nnumber  of  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation  delays.  The  existing  PIU  will \nimplement  the  Project  and  has  identified  the  number  and  type  of  additional  staff  that  will  be \nhired  to  assist  in  implementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  detailed  design  has  been \ncompleted and reflected in the project costs. Advance action has been requested, and the PIU \nis  now  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  will  be  able  to  make  full  use  of  the  advance  action \nprovisions. The Government has been made aware of ADB\u2019s emphasis on the timely provision \nof  counterpart  funds  and  has  ensured  the  project  processing  missions  that  it  can  provide  the \nnecessary funds for both ADB road rehabilitation projects in a timely manner. In addition, ADB is \nmonitoring  the  Public  Investment  Program  restrictions  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  the \n\nProject Risks \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1995.

This  risk  has \nbeen mitigated by the assumption that full benefits from international generated traffic will not be \nrealized until 2012. There is also a risk that the project roads will not be properly maintained and \nthus  the  full  benefits  of  the  Project  will  not  be  realized.  The  Government  is  aware  of  the \nimportance  of  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the  project  area,  which  is  mountainous  and \nprone to landslides and rockfalls. The project design includes elements to address the risks of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the  project  roads.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  loan  assurances  requiring  the  allocation  of  specific  levels  of \nfinancing  for  maintaining  the  project  roads,  in  addition  to  the  assurances  regarding  levels  of \nfinancing for road maintenance nationally. The Project also includes procurement of $1 million \nof  road  maintenance  equipment,  which  will  be  used  solely  on  the  project  roads.  Part  of  the \nproject area (from Obigarm to Nurobod) is in an area that was placed under a United Nations \nsecurity  restriction  following  the  civil  war.  However,  the  security  status  was  upgraded  in  late \n2002 and is expected to remain in the upgraded condition. A United Nations security escort is \nstill required for foreign personnel traveling past Obigarm. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nassurances, which are  incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n \n\nCounterpart funding.

Development  planning  for  the  subsectors  was  the \nresponsibility  of  separate  government  organizations.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Roads \nserved  as  the  national  agency  for  road  infrastructure  management,  managed  road  transport \nenterprises,  allocated  budgets,  assigned  work,  and  managed  personnel.  Tajik  Railway \nCompany served as the agency for railways, and Tajikistan State Air Company for civil aviation \nand  airports.  Each  organization  was  responsible  for  preparing  development  plans  and \ninvestment  programs  for  its  own  subsector.  During  implementation of the development plans, \nthe  Office  of  the  President  provided  coordination  for  review  and  revision  of  the  investment \nprograms and for allocation of investment funds among the subsectors.  \n \n3. \nAs a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \nof  the  transport  sector  was  reorganized  and  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)  was  created.  MOT, \nwhich  now  includes  Tajik  Rail  (Tajikistan  Railway)  and  Tajik  Air  (Tajikistan  Airlines),  is \nresponsible for planning and coordinating  all modes of transport within the country. The current \norganization  chart  for  MOT  is  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to develop a transport sector that meets the needs of a market-based economy. The \nreorganized MOT reflects a policy of promoting competition, increasing the private sector's role, \nand enabling customers to make informed decisions. In the future most state-owned enterprises \nwill play a minor role and will be expected to operate as independent commercial enterprises. \nSeparate  deputy  ministers  are  responsible  for  rail  transport  and  air  transport.  These  are \nregulatory  and  oversight  responsibilities  only  and  the  line  functions  remain  with  Tajik  Rail  and \nTajik Air, respectively. MOT\u2019s Roads Department is responsible for administration, maintenance, \nand construction of roads in Tajikistan, and has a number of associated entities. For example, \nTajikgiprotransstroy  (the  Design  Institute,  a  joint  stock  company),  is  responsible  for  surveys, \ntesting of materials, design of maintenance, and new construction in the subsector. \n \nC. \n \nTajikistan\u2019s  road  standards  and  specifications  are  based  on  those  of  the  former  Soviet \n4. \nUnion  (FSU).  Several  studies  have  indicated  that  the  design  standards  of  FSU  state  roads \n(national roads in Tajikistan) are sometimes higher than those of the United States or European \ncountries  but  do  not  always  result  in  optimum  road  design.  For  lower-standard  roads,  FSU \nstandards  for  design  speed  and  cross  sections  are  similar  to  those  used  in  developing \ncountries,  but  for  higher-category  roads,  they  are  excessive.  The  quality  of  construction  of \nTajikistan\u2019s  roads  is  generally  inadequate,  mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  cost-effective \nconstruction techniques and independent construction supervision. Road safety is discussed in \nparas. 54\u201355 of the main text. \n \n \n \n\nRoad Standards and Safety \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 25\n\nRoad Transport Industry \n\nRoad Subsector Revenue and Expenditure \n\nD. \n \n5. \nMajor  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially  in  the  commercialization,  and  in  some  cases  privatization,  of  the  industry.  In 1998, \nthe  Government  had  jurisdiction  over  81  road  transport  service  enterprises.  Most  intercity  bus \nand  trucking  operations  are  now  organized  as  joint  stock  companies,  with  various  shares  of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nformerly  part  of  MOT  and  designated  by  the  Government  for  privatization,  73%  are  wholly-\nowned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately-owned, and 21% have mixed public-private \nownership. As of March 2002, 5,226 vehicles were operated by joint stock companies and other \norganizations  within  MOT.  Of  these,  3,627  vehicles  or  69%  were  operated  by  four  joint  stock \ncompanies \n(Badakshonnakliyot,  Khatlontrans,  Khudjandnaklyot,  and  Kulyabtrans).  The \nremaining  vehicles  were  operated  by  other  MOT  departments,  Tajik  Air,  and  Tajik  Rail.  A \nsignificant  portion  of  trucking  and  most  long-distance  bus  services  are  operated  by  private \ncompanies.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely  deregulated;  road  haulage \norganizations  enter  into  agreements with customers at negotiated rates. Tariffs for passenger \ntransport  are  still  regulated.  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  jointly  establish  tariffs  for \npassenger transport for buses, minibuses, and taxis for urban and long-distance services. While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay, and do not follow the official tariff. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road-user taxes, such as excise taxes on \npurchases  of  vehicles  and  parts,  tires,  fuel,  and  lubricants,  but  including  a  2.5%  tax  on \ntransactions  by  all  companies;  (ii)  charges  on  international  transit  shipments;  (iii)  vehicle \ninspection fees and registration fees; and (iv) contributions from local governments. In practice, \nonly half of the Road Fund collection was allocated to road rehabilitation and maintenance; the \nother  half  was  used  to  fund  new  construction.  As  a  result  of  general  fiscal  constraints  and \nallocations to new construction, expenditures on road maintenance and rehabilitation have been \nmuch lower than what was needed to maintain the road network at an acceptable level. Details \non the current status of road subsector financing are discussed in para. 6 of the main text. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nMaintenance  of  the  road  network  throughout  Tajikistan  virtually  ceased  following  the \ncollapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Maintenance  funding  was  also  unavailable  during  the  civil  war \nwhen  numerous  bridges  and  road  sections  were  damaged.  Heavily  loaded  trucks  and  army \ntanks reportedly used the roads during this period and undoubtedly contributed to the structural \ndamage  of  the  pavement.  Funding  for  road  maintenance  has  decreased by almost 99% since \nindependence, and this inadequate funding is reflected in the deteriorated condition of the road \nnetwork.  Allocation  of  funding  is  often  restricted  to  emergency  maintenance  needs  and  is \ninsufficient  for  routine  or  periodic  maintenance  requirements.  Little,  if  any,  preventative \nmaintenance activities are currently being undertaken outside of Dushanbe as part of a detailed, \nplanned,  and  scheduled  road  maintenance  program.  Following  the  breakup  of  the  state  and \ncollective farms, respons ibility for maintenance of the rural and farm roads formerly under their \njurisdiction now rests with the local district administrations.  \n \n \n \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n\f26\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n8. \nMOT is responsible for the planning and coordination of the maintenance of Tajikistan's \nroad network.  MOT  maintains  roads  and  bridges,  through  five  maintenance  divisions  that  are \nresponsible for the maintenance activities in their regions. These maintenance divisions include \nBadahshonroh,  Dushanbe  Road  Management \n(DRM),  Khatlonroh,  Khudjandroh,  and \nTajikdorstroitrest.  These  five  divisions  are  responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  approximately \n14,000 km of road, and employed 3,291 people in 2001. These road maintenance divisions are \nstate  entities,  attached  to  MOT.  None  of  the  road  maintenance  units  (RMUs)  has  been \nprivatized.  While  it  is  the  stated  intention  of  MOT  to  eventually  privatize  this  function,  no \nprogress has been made to date. The road maintenance divisions prepare annual maintenance \nplans and budgets based on systems established during the Soviet era. This information is then \npresented to MOT, which in turn allocates funding to the various divisions. DRM is responsible \nfor  maintenance  in  the  Region  of  Republican  Subordination  (RRS)  and,  in  particular  for  the \nproject road from Dushanbe to Nurobod, formerly Darband. The RRS is made up of 15 RMUs, \nwhich are located throughout the RRS. These RMUs are responsible for the road network within \ntheir  jurisdiction  with  actual  maintenance  being  carried  out  by  staff  who  are  responsible  for \nmaintenance  of  specific  sections  of  road.  DRM  has  760  people  who  are  engaged  in  annual \nmaintenance activities within the project area with an annual budget of TJS517,000. However, \nthe plant, equipment, and materials available to the workforce are not sufficient for carrying out \neffective maintenance activities. \n \nG. \n \n9. \nMarket-oriented  reforms  for  the  transport  sector  are  now  being  introduced  through \nimplementation  of  the  ADB-financed  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,1  the  completed  Postconflict \nInfrastructure Program,2 and several related advisory technical assistance activities.3 The status \nand  achievements  to  date  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  are  summarized  in  the  Transport  Sector \nPolicy Reform Plan, Table A2. \n \n\nPolicy Dialogue for the Transport Sector \n\nTable A2: Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan \n\n \nInitiative \nPoverty Impact \n\n1. \n\n \n\n \n\nStatus Prior to Policy \nDialogue with ADB \nRural roads directly serving \npoor communities are in a \nserious state of neglect and \ndeterioration \n \n\n2. \n\nIncrease road \nmaintenance \nfinancing \n\nLevels of financing for road \nmaintenance are grossly \ninadequate \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nActions for Transport Sector \n(i)  140 km of rural roads serving poor \ncommunities will be improved \nunder Loan 1819-TAJ(SF) \n\n \n\n \nImplementation Date \nimplementation \nunder way \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)  77 km of rural roads serving poor \ncommunities will be improved \nunder the proposed Project \nincrease annual budget allocations \nfor road maintenance and \nrehabilitation by 10% per year \nthrough 2004; increase annual \nbudget allocations and \nexpenditures by 15% per year \nduring 2005\u20132007 \n\n(ii)  budget for road maintenance \nshould comprise specified \npercentages of total budget for \nroad maintenance and \nconstruction: 50\u201370% during \n2001\u20132004; 80% (excluding \n\n(ii)  agreed to under \nproposed project \n\n(i)  compliance \n\nongoing for Loan \n1819-TAJ; agreed \nto under  proposed \nproject \n\n \n \n(ii)  not complied with \n\nfor Loan 1819-TAJ; \nagreed to under \nproposed project \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

The  ongoing  Loan \n1819-TAJ (footnote 1) includes a number of covenants that were originally part of Loan 1651-\nTAJ  (footnote  2).  While  the  Government  has  complied  with  a  number  of  these  covenants, \nparticularly those related to implementation of the Transport Law,  it has not complied with four \ncovenants,  relating  primarily  to  corporatization  of  the  railway  and  aviation  subsectors.  The \nGovernment,  in  a  letter  of  6  October  2003,  formally  requested  an  extension  of  the  dates  of \ncompliance for two outstanding covenants and waivers of two other outstanding covenants. The \nGovernment\u2019s  achievements  regarding  each  of  these  covenants,  actions  being  undertaken  in \ncoordination with other development partners, and actions the Government has requested from \nADB are described  as  follows.  ADB has approved  the Government's requests concerning the \ncovenants. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nDevelop  time-bound  action  plans,  acceptable  to  ADB  for  corporatization \nand  further  commercialization  of  Tajik  Airlines  and  Tajik  Airports.  The \nGovernment  issued  Decree  666  in  June  2002  regarding  corporatization  and \ncommercialization of civil aviation (and Tajik Rail). The Government also has an \nongoing  project  and  policy  dialogue  in  the  civil  aviation  subsector  with  the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development.  Based  on  the  progress \nmade to date in reforming the aviation subsector and the ongoing program with \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  Government  has \nrequested that ADB waive this covenant. \n\nDefine  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  shareholders  and  Board  of \nDirectors  of  the  corporatized  Tajik  Rail.  The  Government  plans  to  begin \nimplementing  this  covenant  in  2004  (in  accordance  with  Decree  82  of  March \n2002). The Government has requested extension of the compliance date for this \nloan covenant from May 2003 to 31 December 2005.  \n\nDevelop  corporate  plan  for  Tajik  Rail.  The  Government  plans  to  begin \nimplementing this covenant in 2004 (also in accordance with Decree 82 of March \n2002). The Government has requested extension of the compliance date for this \nloan covenant from June 2003 to 31 December 2005.  \n\nPrepare annual reports, available to  the public and audited by independent \nauditors  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards  (IAS), for \nTajik  Rail.  The  Government  issued  Decree  428  in  November  2002  regarding \nimplementation  of  IAS  and  also  has  an  ongoing  project  with  United  States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) to help implement IAS (including \na pilot project with Tajik Rail). The Government has therefore requested that ADB \nwaive this covenant. \n\n \nIn addition, the Government has requested modification of another covenant from Loan \nfinancing  as  a  proportion  of  road  subsector \n\n11. \n1819-TAJ,  regarding  road  maintenance \nexpenditures to make it consistent with the related covenant in the proposed Project. \n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n1. \nAn  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  during  technical  assistance  (TA) \nfact-finding, identifying key poverty and social issues to be analyzed during project preparation. \nBased on the findings during project preparation, a poverty and social analysis (Table A3.1) was \ncarried  out  to  ensure  that  the  Project  meets  the  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The results are summarized in Table A3.1. \n \n\nTable A3.1:  Summary of Poverty and Social Analysis \n\nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?   Yes \n\n  Sector identified as a national priority in country \n\npoverty partnership agreement?   Yes \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Classification:  Poverty Intervention \n\nContribution of the s ector/subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan. The road subsector contributes to poverty \nreduction directly through improved access and reduced costs for transport of agricultural products to markets, \nemployment opportunities, and social services; and indirectly through stimulating economic development.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nThe poverty incidence in the primary project area is estimated at 91%. Approximately 127,000 poor people will be \ndirectly affected  by  the  Project  (91%  of  140,000  residents).  The  majority  of  residents  are  below  the  poverty  line, \nbased on various measures (e.g., employment, income, nutrition, access to medical care, motor vehicle ownership). \nThis Project will directly benefit and provide new economic opportunities for the poor in the project area. The poverty \nintervention classification is justified as this Project upgrades transportation along a main valley  that depends heavily \nupon good access to the capital, Dushanbe. The majority of  traffic and benefits will go to the people in the valley or \ntransport companies who service the areas.  Approximately 44,000 person-months (3,667 person-years) of unskilled \nlabor will be required for construction. Local residents are expected to fill most of this requirement. Total additional \nincome for this unskilled labor component is estimated to be $1.32 million. Economic benefits are expected to accrue \nprimarily from reduced transportation costs and time saving, new employment opportunities, and improved access to \nagricultural markets. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) has been estimated at 0.71.  \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis prepared:  \nA detailed survey covering 768 households was conducted under the project preparation technical assistance (TA). \nSocioeconomic surveys indicate strong support for the Project. Strong support for new employment opportunities was \nindicated. \n \nParticipation strategy: Construction contracts will include provisions for maximizing use of local labor. An associated \nadvisory TA will evaluate a labor-based rural road maintenance program. Monitoring of social and economic progress \nis included in project supervision services. \nD.

The \nGovernment  has  placed  development,  rehabilitation,  and  reform  (including  privatization)  of \ntransport within  the  agenda  on  poverty  reduction.  This  is  in  line  with  one  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, i.e., to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, as well as the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction goals in its poverty partnership agreement of 2002. The Project will contribute \nsignificantly to this goal (paras. 10\u201314). \n  \nA. \n \n\nThe Project Area \n\n1. \n\nDescription of the Project Impact Area \n\n \n3. \nThe primary impact area is largely agricultural. However, there is very little arable land \nper  capita  in  this  part  of  Tajikistan.  The  median  per  capita  holding  of  cropland  in  the  primary \nimpact area is only 2/100th of a hectare \u2014 only one third the amount of land per person in poor \nareas of eastern and central People's Republic of China,1 for example. Much of the agricultural \nland  is  in  hillside  fields  of  marginal  land  with  slopes  of  up  to  60%  and  subject  to  significant \nerosion.  The  farther  from  Dushanbe,  the  higher  the  elevation,  and  the  lower  the  quality  of  the \nland. Much of the land has been used for subsistence crops since the outbreak of the civil war in \nthe 1990s, rather than for cash crops or raising animals. Principal  household crops are wheat, \npotatoes, apples, carrots, onions, and grapes. Livestock is also raised. Much of the best land in \nthe  two  Vahdat  (Kofarnikhon)  jamoats  is  used  to  grow  cotton;  however,  much  of  the  income \ngoes  to  taxes.  Generally,  for  grain  in  this  area,  the  higher  the  elevation  and  the  steeper  the \nslopes, the lower the quality of the soil and yield per hectare. It would take (on average) 2.35 of \nthe land area in Faisabod to produce as much grain as is produced in Vahdat, and 3.33 times \nthe area to grow that same amount in Rogun. \n \n\n2. \n\nEmployment in the Project Area \n\n \n4. \nUnemployment and underemployment are widespread in the primary impact area. Eight \nof 13 jamoat heads surveyed said that most of the male working age population in their jamoat \nhad no job at  all. Two others said that about 50% had no job. Lack of processing capability and \nlack  of  ready  markets  feed  the  continuation  of  low  value  subsistence  agriculture,  thus  limiting \nemployment opportunities. All three primary impact districts produce apples, some of which are \nhigh-value varieties. However, there are no facilities for export to international markets, and no \nfacilities  for  processing  the  apples  into  higher  value  foods.  Similarly,  the  uplands  of  the  three \ndistricts appear to be ideal countryside for dairy farming (the highland areas may be more suited \nto  sheep  and  goats)  for  processing  and  sale  of  products  into  regional  markets.  The civil war \ndestroyed  most  of  the  livestock,  which  in  general  has  not  been  replaced  yet.  Electricity; \ncommunications;  investment  capital  (for  both  plants  and  livestock);  and  cost  effective, \nappropriate,  and  reliable  transport  are  needed  for  development  in  this  area.  Households \ncontinue to raise wheat to make bread in the mountainous areas where yields are low. Ideally, \nthis part of Tajikistan should be raising more high-value, labor-intensive crops for market (and \nprocessing) while importing wheat produced more efficiently elsewhere.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  See feasibility studies conducted for ADB for the Hefie-Xi'an, and Ganzhou-Longyan railway projects. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\n3. \n\nPoverty in the Project Area \n\n \n5. \nBased  upon  national  and  regional  data,  discussions  with  local  officials,  household \nsurveys, and visits to villages and schools, it is estimated that 91% of the people in the primary \nimpact area of the Project are living in poverty.  Two indicators of poverty for this Project were \nselected, i.e., protein per person per day and days per week meat is eaten. Table A3.2 shows \nthe percent that are below the 60-gram per person per day standard for protein intake and the \npercent below 90% of that standard.  2 \n \n\nTable A3.2:  Protein Consumption in the Project Area \n \n\nPercent Below Standard \n \n\nVahdat \n\n \n\n(2 jamoats)  Faisabod  Rogun \n\n93 \n88 \n\n \n \n\n95 \n91 \n\n \n \n\n95 \n93 \n\nPrimary \nImpact Area \n95 \n91 \n\n \n\nProtein Standard \n(per day) \n\n60 grams standard \n54 grams (90% of 60 gram) \nNote: Based on survey of 765 households. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n\n \n6. \nThe project preparatory TA consultants surveyed what proportion of the population eats \nmeat and for how many days per week (Table A3.3). The \"meat days\" method is simpler, less \nprecise,  and  less  sophisticated  than  the  \"protein  per  person\"  method.  Those  who eat meat 3 \ndays per week or less are considered poor, while those who eat meat 4 days per week or more \nare  not  poor.  This  yields  a  poverty  rate  of  82%  in  the  Vahdat  jamoats,  85%  in  Faisabod,  and \n93% in Rogun, for an overall rate of 86% for the primary  impact area using this indicator. Using \nthe results of the household survey and adopting the 90% of the 60 grams of protein per person \nper  day  standard,  absolute  poverty  is  projected  to  afflict  91%  of  the  population  of  the  primary \nimpact area, 88% of the two Vahdat jamoats, 91% of Faisabod, and 93% of Rogun. \n \n\nTable A3.3:  Days of Meat Consumption Per Person Per Week \n\n \nPercent of Population \n\n \nMeat 7 Days per Week \nMeat 4 to 6 Days per Week \nMeat 1 to 3 Days per Week \nNo Meat \nTotal \nNote: Based on survey of 6,635 households. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n\nVahdat \n(2 Jamoats) \n        (%) \n18.2 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n81.8 \n100.0 \n\n \nFaisabod \n    (%) \n13.4 \n1.8 \n10.6 \n74.2 \n100.0 \n\n \nRogun \n\n     (%) \n6.8 \n0.0 \n25.0 \n68.2 \n100.0 \n\n \nTotal \n       (%) \n13.5 \n0.9 \n10.4 \n75.2 \n100.0 \n\n \nThe  project  preparatory  TA  consultants  also  surveyed  subjective  perceptions  of \n7. \npeople  in  the  primary  impact  area.  In  the  survey,  people  were  asked  to  place  themselves \nand their household on a nine-step ladder, where the first step is extreme poverty and the \nhighest (ninth) step is wealth. Fewer than 9% see themselves as at the midpoint or above it; \n15% see themselves as in extreme poverty; 65% as just above extreme poverty; and 10% \nas below the midpoint. Together, that is 90% of the population.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The  United  Nations'  Human  Development  Index  for  Tajikistan  is  significantly  distorted  by  the  relatively  high \n\neducational levels of the population and is not used. \n\n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n4. \n\nGender Issues \n\n \n8. \nWell-defined,  traditional  gender  roles  embedded  in  Tajik  culture  are  in  place  in  the \nprimary  impact  area  and  largely  observed  by  both  men  and  women.  These  roles  prescribe, \namong other practices, dress and the division of labor within households. This traditional culture \nexists  within  the  context  of  70  years  of  Soviet  official  insistence  upon  equal  opportunity  for \nwomen.  Neither  observation,  discussion  with  school  heads,  nor  the  survey  data  indicated \ndiscrimination  against  girls  at  school  or  inequality  of  educational  opportunity.  A  number  of \nwomen  hold  high  positions  in  local  government.  Women  have,  however,  been  adversely \naffected by the lack of personal security, economic impoverishment, and declining participation, \nas a result of  both  war  and  economic  transition.  Due  to  the  civil  war,  the  number  of  families \nheaded  by  single  women  has  increased.  The  economic  transition  has  severely  affected \nindustries that  employ  a  high  proportion  of  women  (textiles,  manufacturing,  and  agriculture), \ncausing them to be among the first to lose their jobs. Other sectors where women predominate, \nsuch as health and education, are those where wages are least likely to have been paid. The \ncollapse of the state social safety net has exacerbated the number of women and families living \nin  poverty,  while  the  loss  of  quotas  guaranteeing  equal  representation  in  political  and \ngovernmental bodies has increasingly kept them out of decision-making positions.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAffordability and Absorptive Capacity \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact-Related Project Features \n\n \n9. \nNo toll will be charged for use of  the project roads. The reduced VOCs are expected to \nbe passed on to users of transport services due to competitive market conditions. The poor will \nbenefit from savings in the transport costs. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact.  The rural \nroads  included  in  the  Project  were  selected  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  geographic \nlocation,  (ii)  poverty  and  social  considerations,  (iii)  economic  and  traffic  criteria,  (iv) \nsustainability, and (v) cooperation. Discussions were held with the Ministry of Transport (MOT), \nlocal  government  officials,  and  residents  of  rural  villages.  The  criteria  for  geographic  location \nwere  incorporated  through  examination  of  topographic  maps  of  the  area  and  discussions with \nproject  engineers.  Poverty  and  social  considerations  were  included  using  results  of  the  social \nsurveys.  Economic  and  traffic  criteria  were  based  on  economic  information  on  the  villages, \ninterviews  in  the  field,  and  traffic  count  data.  Cooperation  links  the  current  Project  with  other \nprojects focused on agriculture and other industries to further develop within the project area. \n \n\nTable A3.4: Village Groups and Lengths of Rural Roads \n\nKilometer of Rural Roads \n\nDistrict \nRogun \n \nFaisabod \n \n \n \n \n \nVahdat \n \n\nKatiob jamoat \n\nFaisabod jamoat \nZulfi \nPionerabod \nKarsang \nIlok \n\nZulfi \n \n\n \nTotal \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n\n \n25.1 \n \n24.0 \n9.3 \n3.1 \n3.7 \n2.5 \n \n9.3 \n77.0 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\nThe groups of villages served by the rural road networks were identified by local officials \n11. \nas the  poorest  areas  of  their  districts  and  jamoats.  This  judgment  was  confirmed  by  the  data \ndeveloped during the TA, including the household and village surveys. The Katiob grouping is \nthe highest priority as it is the poorest. These roads serve villages on a high mountainside, with \nrelatively poor land, family landholdings inadequate for subsistence, a short growing season and \nsignificant isolation. The poor quality of local roads exacerbates the already significant isolation \nof these villages. The Zulfi grouping is ranked second and comprises villages in the Faisabod \nand Vahdat districts. This is also a mountain area with less productive land, widespread poverty, \nand  greater  isolation  from  markets  and  health  and  other  social  services,  made  worse  by  the \ndeteriorated  conditions  of  the  road  network.  The  Faisabod  grouping  is  ranked  third.  It  is  a \ndensely  populated  area  on  the  other  side  of  the  river  valley  from  the  project  highway.  It  is \ncurrently cut off from the main highway and the district center by a missing sec tion of the main \nbridge.  While  these  villages  are  at  low  elevations,  the  valley  is  not  wide  and  much  of  the \navailable  land  has  considerable  slope.  The  remaining  three  groups  are  much  smaller  and \naddress the needs of other impoverished villages. \n \nC. \n \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\n1. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits \n\n \nThe economic analysis quantified five categories of project benefits: (i) VOC savings for \n12. \nnormal traffic, (ii) international generated traffic, (iii) local generated traffic, (iv) poverty reduction \nbenefits, and (v) time savings. The project benefits have been distributed among the following \ngroups:  (i)  users  of  freight  transport,  (ii)  users  of  passenger  transport,  (iii)  vehicle  owners,  (iv) \nlabor, (v) the Government, and (vi) the economy of Tajikistan (Appendix 12). For VOCs, 80% of \nthe  savings  are  attributable  to  trucks  and  20%  to  buses  and  cars.  As  the  trucking  industry  in \nTajikistan  is  in  the  private  sector,  and  competition  is  strong  on  the  project  road,  most  of  the \nreduction in VOCs are likely to be passed on to users in terms of lower transport charges. It is \nassumed that 10% of VOC savings for trucks will go to owners of vehicles and labor; with the \nremaining  90%  to  users.  The  same  percentage  distribution  is  assumed  for  VOC  savings  to \npassenger  vehicles.  These  allocations  of  benefits  have  been  applied  to  benefits  from  normal \nand local generated traffic. Benefits from international generated traffic result from increases in \ntrade  and  have  been  allocated  to  the  economy.  Poverty  benefits  represent  real  increases  in \nincomes of poor people in the vicinity of project road, and have been attributed to the economy. \n \n\n2. \n\nCalculation of Poverty Impact Ratio \n\n \n13. \nThe distribution of benefits to the poor and poverty impact ratio are shown in Table A3.5. \nThe  Project  will  have  direct  poverty  reduction  impact  through  (i)  increased  prices  received  by \nhouseholds  and  private  farms  of  poor  villages  for  their  agricultural  products;  (ii)  reduced \ntransport  costs  for  shipping  agricultural  products  to  Dushanbe;  (iii)  reduced  bus  fares  for poor \npeople traveling on the project road; and (iv) reduced transport costs on the rural roads, which \nreduce the prices for inputs (e.g., seeds, fertilizers, consumable, etc.) purchased in rural villages. \nBenefits to freight and passenger transport users have been allocated to  the poor on the basis \nof the transport user population that is poor. Users of passenger transport services will primarily \nbe residents of the project area and benefits are allocated to using the poverty incidence of 91% \nin  the  project  area.  Some  freight  transport  users  will  be  residents  of  Dushanbe,  which  has  a \nlower  poverty  incidence.  Therefore,  an  estimated  83%  (national  poverty  incidence)  of  road \nfreight users are poor. The  benefits to freight transport users are distributed to  the poor on the \nbasis of 75%.  It is assumed that only 5% of vehicle owners are poor and benefits to the poor \nwere allocated accordingly.  Bus  fares  are  not  regulated  and  there  is  free  competition  among \n\n \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3 \n\noperators. Therefore, it is assumed that savings in VOCs of buses will be passed on to transport \nusers. Based on 2010 VOCs for buses, the savings for a trip between Dushanbe and Rogun will \nbe  7.8%,  and  between  Dushanbe  and  Faisabod,  4.0%  following  project  completion.  Local \nofficials estimated that 500 passengers per day travel between Rogun and Dushanbe and 1,200 \npassengers between Faisabod and Dushanbe. Typical bus fares from Rogun are TJS2.5 (about \n$0.80) per trip and from Faisabod, TJS1.5 (about $0.50). This results in annual savings for poor \npeople traveling by bus to Dushanbe of about $24,500 for passengers from Rogun and about \n$18,000 for passengers from Faisabod.  \n \n\nTable A3.5: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio \n($ million in present value at 12% discount rate) \n\n \n\n \n\nNet \nNational \nBenefits \n\n \nVehicle \nOwners \n \n  0.94 \n \n\n \n\n \nFinancial \nPV \n\n \nEconomic \nPV \n\n \nEconomic- \nFinancial \n\n \nPassenger \nUsers \n\n \nFreight \nUsers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n6.39 \n\n8.26 \n\n8.26 \n\n8.26 \n\n2.37 \n\n2.12 \n\n0.12 \n\n0.13 \n\n1.53 \n\n8.26 \n\n1.51 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n11.72 \n\n11.72 \n\n24.06 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1.53 \n0.24 \n\n1.53 \n0.24 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n0.66 \n1.51 \n0.13 \n\n0.66 \n1.51 \n0.13 \n\n2.37 \n0.91 \n2.16 \n\n0.66 \n1.51 \n0.13 \n\n(15.20) \n(0.71) \n\n \n  8.66 \n \n\nLabor \n \n \n \n\n 0.24 \n \n 0.24 \n \n0.24 \n 0.83 \n 0.20 \n\n \n  0.07 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  0.48 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n  9.14 \n \n  9.14 \n  0.75 \n  6.86 \n\n \n \n  1.00 \n \n  1.00 \n  0.10 \n  0.10 \n\nEconomy \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n(16.73) \n(0.94) \n \n(17.67) \n \n\n \n  11.72 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  24.06 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  11.30 \n \n  (6.37) \n \n0.75 \n  (4.78) \nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGains and Losses \nProportion of the Poor \nNet Benefits for the Poor \n\nItem \nBenefits \nVOC Savings \nInt'l Generated \n Traffic \n \nGen Domestic \n \nTraffic \nPoverty  \nTime Savings \nCosts \nInvestment and  \n  maintenance \nLabor \nNet Present \nValue \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPV = present value; VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \nBenefits to labor were attributed to poor people on the basis of the estimated number of \n14. \npoor that would be involved in construction of the project road. Based on an evaluation of the \nconstruction  costs  for  the  project  road,  as  well  as  similar  evaluations  in  Asia,  approximately \n4,400  person-months  of  unskilled  labor  will  be  needed  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will \nencourage unskilled labor jobs by poor people  in  the vicinity of the  work. This amounts to 83% \nof  total  benefit  attributable  to  labor.  Benefits  attributed  to  the  economy  are  primarily  from \ngenerated  traffic,  which  is  assumed  to  be  international  flows  between  Tajikistan  and  the \nPeople's Republic of China. This would likely benefit the poor people in villages along the road, \nas  well  as  residents  of  Dushanbe.  The  poverty  reduction  benefits  are  based  on  higher  prices \nreceived  for  agricultural  products  produced  in  the  project  area.  For  many  producers,  the  road \nimprovements  will  enable  them  to  take  their  produce  to  Dushanbe  for  sale  at  higher  prices \ncompared  with  local  markets  close  to  the  villages.  Based  on  discussions  with  villagers  and \nparticipants  at  local  markets  along  the  road,  producers  can  receive  50\u2013100%  more  for  their \ngoods  if  sold  in  markets  in  Dushanbe,  instead  of  local  markets.  This  price  differential  would \nlikely be higher the greater the distance from Dushanbe. To compute benefits in a conservative \nmanner, an increase in selling price was estimated to be 60% for produce in the Faisabod area; \n70% from Rogun and 50% from Vahdat. As a result of the calculation in Table A3.5, the poverty \nimpact ratio has been calculated to be 0.71, meaning that 71% of the benefits will accrue to the \npoor. \n\n6.39 \n \n4.54 \n0.71 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35\n\n3. \n\nResettlement Effects of the Project \n\n \n15. \nDiscussion with MOT officials, an inventory of road status, visits to sites of adjustments \nin the alignment, and review of maps and engineering drawings indicate that no resettlement is \nexpected  in  the  implementation  of  this  Project.  All  project  activities  will  take  place  within  the \nexisting  alignment  or  on  land  owned  by  the  Government.  No  impact  on  existing  cropland  or \nother productive land, or housing or other structures is planned. All land used will be within the \nexisting right-of-way. No farmland, other productive land, housing, shops, or other structures will \nbe affected. While decisions as to the location of construction maintenance bases will be made \nby contractors, contractors will be likely to rent or lease existing MOT maintenance facilities and \nexisting \"machine tractor stations\" of collective farms (and former collective farms) that are near \nthe road. In either case, no temporary taking of productive land or structures is anticipated. Thus \nno  resettlement  (as  defined  in  ADB's  Handbook  on  Resettlement)  is  necessary  for  the \nimplementation of the Project, and no adverse effects to people, buildings, and productive lands \nare anticipated. \n \n\nEffects of the Project on Ethnic Minorities \n\n4. \n \n16. \nThe  people  living  in  the  area  are  almost  entirely  ethnic  Tajiks.  Kyrgyz  people  live  near \nthe  border  with  Kyrgyzstan,  far  beyond  Nurobod  (Darband)  and  the  project  area.  All  of  the \nfamilies  of  ethnic  groups  within  the  project  area  who  may  have  lived  in  traditional  ways  for \ncenturies were collectivized and integrated into the economic and social structure of the Soviet \nUnion during the 1920s and 1930s, in line with the Soviet goals of that era to industrialize rural \nproduction  and rural ways of life.  Ethnic  minorities  are  less  than  5%  of  the  population  of  the \nprimary  impact  area  and  are  clustered  in  three  places:  Turks  in  Jamoat  Vahdat,  Uzbeks  in \nJamoat  Yangibozor  (Vahdat  District),  and  Russians  in  Rogun  City.  No  adverse  impacts  or \nsignificant changes to their livelihoods or culture are anticipated. \n \n\n5. \n\nPoverty Impact of the Road Improvements \n\nPoverty Impact Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe Project will have a substantial poverty impact which  is discussed in detail in paras. \n\n \n17. \n20\u201322 of the main text. \n \nD. \n \n18.  Monitoring and evaluating the poverty impact of the Project is discussed in para. 39 of \nthe main text.  A draft  project performance management system is included in Appendix 9. It is \nrecommended  that  portions  of  the  household  survey  are  repeated  with  the  same  households \nannually during construction and after road rehabilitation is completed. This will enable changes \nin  the  social  and  economic  situation  of  these  households  to  be  analyzed  to  understand  what \nkinds of benefits are attributed to the improvements in road transport result. \n\n \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n \n\n \n\n \nProject Name  \n\nLoan/TA/ \nProject \nNumber \n\n \n \n \nA.

Existing  data  on  historical  traffic  counts  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport  on  major  road \nsections were also reviewed to determine appropriate base-year traffic. \n \n2. \nThe  dissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  the  outbreak  of  civil  war  caused  a \ndramatic  reduction  in  traffic  on  the  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border  road.  Traffic  levels  on  the  four \nproject  sections  (excluding  rural  roads)  are  on  average  about  80%  lower  than  in  1990.  Since \n1995, however, traffic levels have been slowly increasing. Average annual growth rates on the \nfour  road  sections  during  1995\u20132002  are,  on  average,  3.3%.  Average  traffic  volumes  (in \nvehicles  per  day)  on  the  project  road  sections  are  4,623  vehicles  per  day  on  the  Dushanbe-\nVahdat  section,  665  on  the  Vahdat-Faisabod  section,  526  on  the  Faisabod-Obigarm section, \nand 399 on the Obigarm-Nurobod section. Trucks comprise the largest portion of traffic (51%\u2013\n56%) traffic on the project road, except for the Dushanbe-Vahdat section with 33%. Cars are the \nsecond  most  important,  comprising  36%\u201344%,  with  the  exception  of  the  Dushanbe-Vahdat \nsection, with 64%, due to the higher income levels in Dushanbe. \n \nB. \n \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2003\u2013\n3. \n2027.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \npopulation and on income elasticities of demand for freight and passenger vehicles. Population \nis expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 1.6% per year during the remainder \nof  the  project  period.  GDP  is  estimated  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  5%  through  2012  and  4% \nthereafter,  in  line  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  recent  economic  evaluation  of  Tajikistan.2  Income \nelasticities of demand used for 2003\u20132005 are 1.6 for passengers and 1.5 for freight vehicles, \nwhile elasticities of 1.3 and 1.1 are applied to passenger vehicles and freight, respectively, for \nthe remainder of the project period. \n \n4. \nBased  on  forecast  GDP  growth,  population  growth,  and  income  elasticities of demand \nover the total project period, average annual traffic growth rates for trucks, buses, and cars are \nestimated  at  6.5%,  4.6%  and  6.3%  during  2003\u20132012,  and  4.0%,  3.5%,  and  4.7%  during  the \nremainder  of  the  project  period.  Volumes  of  traffic  forecast  on  the  project  road  sections  are \nsummarized in Table A11. Normal traffic is expected to account for 25%\u201335% of total traffic on \nthe project road in 2027, except for the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which it comprises 77% of \nthe  traffic.  Domestic  generated  traffic  resulting  from  lower  transport  costs  arising  from  the \nProject comprises a small portion of total traffic ranging from 3%\u201310% on the four road sections. \nInternational generated traffic comprises 61%\u201372% of total traffic in 2027 except for Dushanbe-\nVahdat on which it comprises only 14%. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Trucks comprise the \nmajority  of  traffic  on  the  project  road,  accounting  for  about  55%  of  traffic  in  2027,  with  the \nexception of the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which trucks account for 36%. Cars account for \nabout 43% of traffic in 2027, except on the Dushanbe-Vahdat section, on which they account for \n62%, due to the higher levels of income and car ownership in Dushanbe compared to the rest of \nthe  project  area.  Buses  comprise  less  than  5%  of  forecast  traffic  on  the  project  road  in  2027. \nThe  composition  of  traffic  by  vehicle  type  is  expected  to  change  slightly  during  the  forecast \nperiod,  with  the  share  accounted  for  by  buses  decreasing  by  less  than  5%.  The  share \naccounted for by trucks changes by 3% or less on the four sections of the main road during the \nforecast  period.  The  share  account  for  by  cars  changes  by  2%  or  less  during  the  forecast \nperiod, except for the Vahdat-Faisabod section, on which it increases by 5%. \n \n6. \nAt present, about 50% of Tajikistan\u2019s imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) \nconsist  of  fabric,  chemicals,  and  cotton  and  tea;  while  cotton  comprises  about  70%  of \nTajikistan\u2019s exports to the PRC. The economic implications are significant in terms of potential \ntrade volumes with the PRC through ground linkage with improved road conditions. In particular, \nthe PRC is expected to provide a large market for Tajikistan\u2019s agricultural output and to become \na  large  source  of  consumer  goods  for  Tajikistan.  The  Project  is  expected  to  establish  a  basic \nfoundation  toward  facilitating  cross-border  traffic  between  Tajikistan  and  the  PRC.  At  present, \nthe need to transship goods at borders is a costly and time-consuming operation for all. Goods \ntransported into the PRC must use Chinese vehicles. The assumption of free vehicle movement \nacross  international  borders  without  the  need  for  transshipment  has  been  incorporated  into \nestimating internationally generated traffic forecast. It is further estimated that the rehabilitation \nof  the  entire  road  section  between  Dushanbe-Kyrgyz  border-PRC  will  be  complete  not  earlier \nthan 2012. The projected Tajikistan-PRC traffic is forecast to build up over a period of 3 years \nbeginning in 2009. This PRC traffic is expected to grow at the same rate as the other traffic on \nthe project road after 2012. \n\n \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nCosts \n\nGeneral \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  each  section  of  the  project  road,  including \n1. \nrural  roads,  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-project \nscenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  receive  only  minimal  maintenance  and  to  continue  to \ndeteriorate.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to \ninternational  standards.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  considered  various \nmutually  exclusive  project  alternatives,  and  the  proposed  Project  is  based  on  the  most  cost \neffective and least cost option. The economic analysis covers 24 years (2004\u20132027), based on \na  4-year  implementation  period.  All  benefits  and  costs  are  in  constant  2003  prices.  The \neconomic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB. \n \nProject  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \n2. \nmaintenance  (including  rural  roads),  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into \ntradable and non-tradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-\ntradable  portion.  To  take  into  account  local  unemployment  and  underemployment,  costs  for \nunskilled  labor  were  adjusted  by  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.75  to  arrive  at  the  economic \nopportunity cost. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nfor  normal  traffic,  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  time  savings,  and  poverty \nalleviation  benefits.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the  same  methodology  used  for \ncosts. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the road surface, horizontal and \nvertical alignment, and increased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for six \ntypes of vehicles were estimated using the highway design and maintenance standards model, \nand  are  shown  in  Table  A12.1.  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  account  for  about  53%  of  total \nbenefits. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. \n \n\nBenefits \n\nTable A12.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km) \n \n\n Item \n2 Axle Truck \n3 Axle Truck \n>3 Axle Truck \nSmall Bus \nLarge Bus \nCar \nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nNote: VOCs are for Dushanbe-Vahdat (Kofarnikhon) road section in 2007. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n\nWithout Project \n121.9 \n159.5 \n312.4 \n62.6 \n151.5 \n133.6 \n\nWith Project \n114.1 \n147.7 \n289.2 \n62.4 \n150.2 \n132.1 \n\n \n\nVOC Savings \n\n7.8 \n11.8 \n23.2 \n0.2 \n1.3 \n1.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nDomestic  generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in \n4. \ntransport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new \ninternational traffic arising from increased trade between Tajikistan and the People's Republic of \nChina  resulting  from  improvement  of  the  project  road.  The  improved  road  conditions  will  also \nresult  in  time  savings.  The  value  of  time  for  bus  passengers  is  calculated  at  $0.062  per  hour. \nCar passengers are assumed to have a 50% higher average value of time. Poverty alleviation \nbenefits  arise  from  the  higher  prices  which  farmers  will  be  able  to  obtain  for  their  produce \nthrough  improved  access  to  markets.  Poverty  alleviation  benefits  are  discussed  in  detail  in \nAppendix  3.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  such  as  improved  access  to  social \nservices, which cannot be quantified. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  for  the  four  main  national \nroad sections, the rural roads component, and for the overall Project (Table A12.2). The EIRR \nfor the overall Project is 15.8%, and the net present value is $6.4 million, using a 12% discount \nrate.  The  EIRRs  for  the  four  main  road  sections  and  rural  roads  range from 12.0% to 32.3%, \nand are shown in Table A12.3. \n \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nTable A12.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($'000) \n \n\nBenefits \nGen \nDomestic \n\n  \n\nCosts \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet \n\nVOC \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Savings \n\nTotal \n \nCapital  Maintenance  Costs \n \n\u2014 \n  3,189 \n  5,315 \n  6,454 \n  6,467 \n89 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n513 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n157 \n \n \n513 \n (10,472) \n \n \n\n \n  \n2003    \u2014 \n2004   3,189 \n2005   5,315 \n2006   6,378 \n2007   6,378 \n2008    \u2014 \n2009    \u2014 \n2010    \u2014 \n2011    \u2014 \n2012    \u2014 \n2013    \u2014 \n2014    \u2014- \n2015    \u2014- \n2016    \u2014- \n2017    \u2014- \n2018    \u2014- \n2019    \u2014- \n2020    \u2014- \n2021    \u2014- \n2022    \u2014- \n2023    \u2014 \n2024    \u2014 \n2025    \u2014 \n2026    \u2014 \n2027  (10,630)\n \n \n \n \n\u2014  = no data available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return; VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nSource:  Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nInt'l Gen \nTraffic \n\u2014 \n\u2014   \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014   \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014   \n \n\u2014 \n146   \n \n\u2014 \n \n382   \n\u2014 \n  1,055   \n\u2014 \n  1,818   \n664 \n  1,944   \n  2,080    1,355  \n  2,225    2,034 \n  2,331    2,129 \n  2,442    2,229 \n  2,557    2,333 \n  2,679    2,442 \n  2,805    2,556 \n  2,938    2,675 \n  2,800 \n   3,077 \n  2,930 \n   3,222 \n  3,067 \n   3,374 \n  3,209 \n   3,533 \n  3,358 \n   3,699 \n  3,514 \n   3,872 \n  3,677 \n   4,054 \n  3,847 \n   4,243 \n   4,441 \n  4,025 \n \n \n \n \n\nTraffic  Poverty  Time  Benefits    Benefits \n \n\u2014 \n  (3,189) \n  (5,315) \n  (6,297) \n  (5,783) \n  1,314  \n  2,062 \n  2,862 \n  3,699 \n  4,533 \n  4,741 \n  4,960 \n  5,188 \n  5,071 \n  5,677 \n  5,939 \n  6,212 \n  6,498 \n  6,797 \n  7,110 \n  7,438 \n  7,780 \n  8,138 \n  8,156 \n  19,532 \n6,386 \n\n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n157 \n \n \n683 \n  1,403 \n  2,220 \n  3,020 \n  3,856 \n  4,690 \n  4,899 \n  5,117 \n  5,346 \n  5,585 \n  5,835 \n  6,096 \n  6,370 \n  6,656 \n  6,955 \n  7,268 \n  7,595 \n  7,937 \n  8,295 \n  8,669 \n  9,059 \nNet Present Value   \n \nEIRR \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          15.8% \n\n  \u2014 \n  \u2014 \n  \u2014 \n  \u2014 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n  281 \n\n  \u2014 \n  \u2014 \n  \u2014 \n3 \n \n3 \n \n10 \n \n19 \n \n20 \n \n22 \n \n24 \n \n25 \n \n27 \n \n29 \n \n30 \n \n32 \n \n35 \n \n37 \n \n39 \n \n41 \n \n44 \n \n47 \n \n50 \n \n53 \n \n56 \n \n59 \n \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n9 \n17 \n57 \n103 \n110 \n118 \n126 \n132 \n139 \n145 \n152 \n160 \n167 \n175 \n183 \n192 \n201 \n211 \n221 \n231 \n242 \n253 \n \n \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n77 \n89 \n89 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n513 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n157 \n513 \n157 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n54\n\n \n\nTable A12.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for Project Road Sections \n \n\nSection \nDushanbe-Vahdat \nVahdat-Faisabod \nFaisabod-Obigarm \nObigarm-Nurobod \nRural Roads \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEIRR (%) \n30.1 \n12.0 \n15.8 \n32.3 \n14.6 \n\n858 \n     (19) \n3,484 \n1,679 \n380 \n\nENPV ($'000) \n\n \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \nE. \n \n6. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative  changes  in  the  key \nparameters that determine the  benefits and costs of the Project.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  under \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance1  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental \nAssessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  This  SIEE  incorporates \nfindings from the IEE led by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and the project preparatory \nTA consultants, and has been reviewed by the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP). \n \n2. \nThe  scope  and  objectives  of  the  IEE  were  to  (i)  ensure  that  environmental \nconcerns  are  fully  taken  into  account  in  the  consideration  of  alternatives  and  in  the \ndesign  and  construction  specification  aspects  of  the  Project2,  (ii)  review  all  possible \nenvironmental  impacts  during  and  after  construction,  including  any  possible  need  for \nland  acquisition  and  compensation/resettlement  arrangements  along  the  proposed \nalignment,  and  (iii)  identify  potential  environmental  issues  to  determine  whether  the \nProject warrants a full environmental impact assessment, pursuant to the requirements \nof ADB. \n \n\nII. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  Dushanbe-Nurobod  (Darband)  portion  of  the  road \n3. \nfrom  Dushanbe  northeast  toward  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  Project  will \nimprove about 140 kilometers of main highway and approximately 77 kilometers of rural \nroads feeding into the project road. The Project includes consulting services for project \nsupervision  and  monitoring,  and  procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  and \nan associated advisory TA for capacity building and institutional strengthening. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT  \n\n \n4. \nTajikistan  is  the  most  southerly  of  the  Central  Asian  republics.  It  is  bordered  to \nthe  north  by  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  in  the  east  by  the  People's  Republic  of  China, \nAfghanistan  to  the  south,  and  Uzbekistan  in  the  west.  Total  area  is  143,000  square \nkilometers,  divided  into  four  regions:  Sughd  in  the  north,  the  Region  of  Republican \nSubordination  (RRS)  in  the  center,  Khatlon  in  the  south,  and  the  mainly  mountainous \nGorno-Badakshan in the east. The project area is located in the RRS. The population of \nTajikistan  was  about  6.12  million  in  2000.  Most  people  (74%)  live  in  rural  areas. \nAgriculture  is  the  dominant  economic  activity  and  the  largest  source  of  income  and \nemployment.  The  population  has  increased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  about  1.6% \nsince the mid-1990s. \n \nThe climate is continental, with cold winters and hot, dry summers, although the \n5. \nrelatively southerly latitude has an ameliorating impact, and altitude significantly affects \nlocal  climate.  The  project  area  is  in  the  dry  climate  belt,  with  annual  average \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Second Road Rehabilitation. Manila. \n2  MNP is planning to strengthen the environmental assessment process (e.g., to include social assessment) \n\nand improve efficiencies of study and approval. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n57\n\ntemperatures  ranging  from  12  degrees  centigrade  in  Dushanbe  to  -1.5  degrees \ncentigrade  in  the  Obigarm-Tavildara  Junction  area.  Elevations  range  from  850  meters \n(m)  above  sea  level  at  Dushanbe  to  over  1,850  m  above  sea  level  near  Obigarm. \nPrecipitation  ranges  from  650  millimeters  in  Dushanbe  to  1200  millimeters  in  the \nObigarm-Tavildara Junction area, which experiences about 1 m of snowfall per year. \n \n6. \nSoils are typically silty gray-brown desert soils of alluvial origin and relatively low \ninherent  fertility.  The  concentration  of  organic  matter  is  low  and  erodibility  is  high. \nGroundwater  levels  are  high.  Water  logging  and  secondary  salinization  are  significant \nenvironmental  problems,  caused  by  failing  drainage  infrastructure  and  poor  water \nmanagement.  Floods  may  occur  at  any  time  due  to  adverse  weather.  Tajikistan  is \nmountainous, with only 960,000 hectares (ha) of arable land (7% of the total area). The \namount of arable land per rural household is only 0.9 ha, plus about 3.5 ha of pasture. \nSignificant areas of often steeply sloping land have been utilized, resulting in increased \nrisk of erosion. \n \nHydrological features in Tajikistan include glaciers and a network of rivers, lakes, \n7. \nand canals. Natural water quality is good. The quantity of industrial wastewater is small. \nThe main water pollution source is domestic sewage in settlements, villages, and cities. \nTajikistan\u2019s  hydropower  production  is  third  in  the  world  after  the  United  States  and \nRussia.  The  most  intense  development  of  these  resources  has  been  in  the  Vakhsh \nValley where Tajikistan's highest dam (Nurek) is located.3 Due to the current low level of \nindustrialization, there are few air pollution sources and air quality, as expected, is good. \nThe  main  source  of  air  pollution  is  transport,  accounting  for  70%  of  the  total  air \npollutants. The dry climate causes natural air pollution (mist and dust storms) during the \nautumn-summer period. \n \n8. \nTopographic characteristics, climate, and soil diversity define the variety of flora \nand fauna. Tajikistan hosts 5,000 plant species, 81 species of mammals, over 365 bird \nspecies, and 49 species of reptiles. Two hundred twenty-six plant species are included \nin the Red Book of Tajikistan as sensitive,  or potentially threatened or endangered. The \nGovernment  has  created  a  number  of  reserves,  national  parks,  biological  research \nstations, and natural monuments. In practice, one specially protected reserve has been \ncreated  in  each  natural  climate  belt.  There  are  4  reserves,  14  small  reserves,  and  2 \nnational parks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nSCREENING OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS  \n\nAND MITIGATION MEASURES \n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Location \n\n \nA. \n \n9. \nThe Project will not have any negative environmental impact on archaeologically \nsignificant sites, nature protection areas, or other culturally important sites. Rehabilitation \nactivities will be confined to the existing right-of-way of the road. No significant changes \nof  the  hydrological  characteristics  of  the  project  area  are  expected.  The  altered  road \nembankment,  borrow  pits,  and  provisions  for  quarry  operations,  disposal  sites,  and \nminor  changes  in  delineation  to  improve  traffic  safety  will  not  require  permanent  land \nacquisition. In some of the road sections, landslides, rockslides, mudslides, flooding, or \nsoil subsidence pose risks. Erosion control of the embankments, pavements, and other \n\n                                                 \n3  The partially completed Rogun hydropower project, upstream of Nurek, will include the highest dam. \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nfrom  MNP, \n\nEnvironmental Problems Related to Design \n\nregulatory  agency.  A  participatory  social \n\nEnvironmental  clearance  has  been  obtained \n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction \n\nroad structures will be taken into account everywhere in the project area, in accordance \nwith the quality standards for the design and construction of the rehabilitation works. \n \nB. \n \nthe  central \n10. \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental \nimpact \nassessment  has  been  made  and  is  discussed  in  Appendix  3.  No  significant  negative \nenvironmental impacts related to the design are foreseen, as long as the asphalt plants, \ncamps, borrow pits, and disposal sites are appropriately located, and national planning \nstandards are appropriately followed.  Special attention needs to be paid to the design of \nthe infrastructure of the workers camps and to monitoring their water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, solid waste management, and overall sanitary conditions. \n \nC. \n \nThe project area has significant topographic variation and naturally high erosion \n11. \nrates.  Detailed  requirements  for  upgrading  erosion  control  will  be  included  in \nconstruction  contracts.  Embankment  slopes  will  be  planted  with  grass  or  otherwise \nprotected  after  the  works  have  been  completed.  Newer  technologies  such  as  hydro-\nseeding,  geotextiles,  and  drain  nets  can  be  used  in  locations  where  erosion  and \nrevegetation are difficult. Replanting work will be done as soon as possible after borrow \nwork is finished.  \n \nContracts  will  require  that  asphalt  and  hot-mix plants be located at least 500 m \n12. \naway  from  the  nearest  sensitive  receptors,  e.g.,  schools  and  hospitals.  Asphalt  will  be \npurchased  from  permanent  factories.  Operators  will  be  required  to  install  noise  and \nexhaust  emission  controls  where  applicable.  Trucks  carrying  earth,  sand,  or  similar \nconstruction  materials  or  waste  spoils  will  be  covered  to  avoid  generation  of  dust  and \nspills. Care will be taken during the construction period to ensure that traffic disruptions \nto road transport are minimized. Detailed temporary arrangements are to be addressed \nin the context of detailed design and implementation planning of the rehabilitation works.  \n \n13. \nIn  construction  staging  areas,  equipment  and  vehicle  fueling  and  maintenance \nmay  cause  contamination  of  soil  and  surface  water  unless  controlled  properly.  During \nthe operation phase, soil and water pollution may result from spills of oil, fuel, and other \nhazardous or toxic cargoes. Fuel storage and refilling areas will  be at least 300 m from \nall cross drainage structures and important water bodies, or as directed by the engineer. \nAn  oil  interceptor  will  be  provided  for  washing  down  and  refueling  areas.  Fuel  will  be \nstored  in  properly  protected  areas.  Construction  material  storage  areas  will  have \nappropriate rainfall control measures. Disposal of solid wastes into water bodies will be \nstrictly prohibited. Waste oils from construction equipment and vehicles and solid waste \nwith oil sludge will be collectively treated. \n \nConstruction  camps  will  have  septic  tanks  and  controlled  solid  waste  disposal \n14. \npits,  which  should  be  closed  within  a  specified  time  after  construction.  Sewage  and \ngarbage from construction camps will be collectively treated or made into fertilizer. Storm \nwater  retention  basins  will  be  constructed  to  prevent  pavement  runoff  from  directly \nentering  surface  waters.  Bridges,  culverts,  and  drainage  ditches  will  be  designed  to \nprevent damage to local irrigation systems. Culverts and drains will be cleared frequently \nto  maintain  storm  water  flow.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  provide  basic  emergency \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59\n\nEnvironmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations \n\nhealth  facilities  for  construction  workers.  Moreover,  the  contractor  will  be  required  to \nconduct a vigorous public health program to contain such contagious diseases as enteric \ndysentery, malaria, and common venereal maladies. Frequent educational meetings will \nbe held to inform the workers of the sources of these diseases and to explain how they \ncan be avoided. \n \n15. \nTo  ensure  contractors\u2019  compliance  with  the  environmental  regulations  and \nstandards,  regular  inspections  by  the  MOT  and  MNP  environmental  staff  and  local \ngovernment  units  will  be  undertaken.  Their  findings  will  be  attached  to  the  weekly  and \nmonthly  progress  reports,  with  comments  on  the  possible  response  to  emerging \nenvironmental concerns. The inspections will cover all relevant issues, for instance the \nuse of appropriate materials, and include possible claims made by the affected people. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe planned road rehabilitation activities will increase traffic levels. The effect on \nair  quality  and  noise  levels  is  considered  minor,  and  no  particular  mitigation  measures \nare  recommended.  Despite  low  traffic  volume  on  existing  roads,  emissions  from  most \nvehicles  (particularly  buses)  are  very  high.  About  80%  of  vehicles  in  the  project  area \nwere  purchased  before  1990,  with  about  40%  purchased  before  1980.  Many  vehicles \nhad  been  used  at  the  time  of  purchase.  Liquefied  petroleum  gas  has  been  introduced \nand is used by some trucks and buses. \n \n17. \nRoad safety is expected to improve with the Project. Possible secondary benefits \ninclude  reduction  of  car  accidents  and  reduced  spills  of  hazardous  chemicals \ntransported by trucks. During operations, contingency plans will be in place for cleaning \nup  spills  of  oil,  fuel,  and  toxic  chemicals.  Maintenance  of  road  surfaces,  drainage \nfacilities, and landscaping should be enhanced to prevent soil erosion. \n \n\nV. \n\nINSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL \n\nMONITORING PROGRAM  \n\n \nEnvironmental  monitoring  of  the  Project  will  be  conducted  by  MOT  and  MNP. \n18. \nMOT  will  ensure  that  tender  documents  and  contracts  for  the  Project  incorporate \nenvironmental mitigation measures. MOT will supervise the consultants through weekly \ninspection  visits  to  the  sites  (visual  observations and communications) and preparation \nof  monthly  reports.  Institutional  requirements  for  the  Project  include  appropriate \nenvironmental  clearance  by  the  Government  and  local  government.  Construction \ncontractors  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  good  health  and  safety  practices, \nincluding dust and noise monitoring and mitigation for worker protection. Environmental \nmonitoring  will  pay  particular  attention  to  embankment  and  erosion  prevention \nrequirements, borrow pit restoration requirements, mining and quarry activities, siting of \nconstruction  camps  and  related  facilities,  siting  of  asphalt  plants,  community  relations, \nand  safety  provisions.  The  costs  for  the  consultants'  participation  in  environmental \nmonitoring is included in the budget for consulting services in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nVI. \n\nPUBLIC CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE \n\nPublic Consultation  \n\n \nA. \n \nPublic consultations were an integral part of project preparation. Surveys of 768 \n19. \nhouseholds were conducted from April through June 2002. Residents in the project area \nsuffer  from  unemployment  and  underemployment,  and  limited  availability  of  energy, \nwater, and sanitation services. The key concerns noted were the selection of local roads \nto be included in the Project and potential employment opportunities generated. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B,  and  the  120-day  public \n20. \ndisclosure  rule  does  not  strictly  apply.  The  IEE  and  SIEE  will  be  made  available  on \nrequest. \n \n\nInformation Disclosure \n\nVII. \n\nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nEnvironmental  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  during  implementation  of  the \n\n \n21. \nProject include the following: \n \n\nMNP will actively participate in monitoring during project construction, but \nwill  serve  primarily  as  an  oversight  agency.  MOT  will  have  primary \nresponsibility \nthe  ongoing  Road \nRehabilitation Project. National laws and guidelines will be followed, and \nadditional  permit  clearances  will  be  obtained  from  other  agencies  as \nnecessary. \n\nfor  monitoring,  as \n\nit  does \n\nfor \n\nAccording  to  the  IEE,  all  negative  impacts  resulting  from the proposed \nroad  rehabilitation  project  can  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level.  The \nproposed  environmental  mitigation  measures  should  be  included  in  the \nconstruction contracts.  \n\nEnvironmental  management  will  be  an \nintegral  part  of  project \nmanagement.  Environmental  monitoring  reports,  based  on  routine \ninspections, will be submitted together with other project progress reports.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nImproved  erosion  control  design  and  maintenance  guidelines  should  be \nincorporated into the project design. \n\n \n\nVIII. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n \n22. \nBased on the IEE, the Project will only have a limited number of minor negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  these  can  be  properly  mitigated.  No  large  construction \nactivities  will  take  place.  The  IEE  meets  both  Government  and  ADB  standards  and  a \ndetailed environmental impact assessment for the Project or further special studies are \nnot warranted. \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit \nTJS1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2003) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "somoni (TJS) \n$0.3274 \nTJS 3.0544 \n", "ADB \nCAR \nCARE \nDRM \nEBRD \nEIRR \nFSU \nGDP \nIAS \nIEE \nMNP \nMOF \nMOT \nNGO \nPIU \nPPMS \nPRC \nRMU \nRRS \nSIEE \nTA \nVOC \n", "economic internal rate of return \nformer Soviet Union \ngross domestic product \ninternational accounting standards \ninitial environmental examination \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Central Asian republic \n\u2013  Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, Inc. \n\u2013  Dushanbe Road Management \n\u2013  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Nature Protection \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Transportation \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  People's Republic of China \n\u2013 \nroad maintenance unit \n\u2013  Region of Republican Subordination \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nongovernment organization \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance management system \n", "summary initial environmental examination \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "jamoat \n", "\u2013 \n", "traditional local community unit in villages \n", "GLOSSARY OF TAJIK TERM \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", " \n", "ha \nkm \nm \n", "hectare \nkilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  meter \n", " \nNOTES \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \nThis  report  was  prepared  by  the  Project  Team  comprising  J.
