I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Northern Road \nConnectivity Project.1 The report also describes proposed change in the associated technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  of  Northern  Provincial  Road  Development \nDepartment (NPRDD),2 and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the change in the TA. \n \n2.  The project, together with the original project, will improve the road connectivity in the \nmost conflict-affected area of the country, and help to restore access to basic social services \nand markets. An additional 110 kilometers (km) of national roads and 120 km of provincial roads \nin the Northern Province and the North Central Province (NCP) will be rehabilitated.3 It will \nfacilitate economic growth and contribute to reducing disparities in Sri Lanka, in line with one of \nthe Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s key goals, which emphasizes equitable growth. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  As Sri Lanka continues to absorb the benefits of the end of its 3-decade civil conflict in \nMay 2009, the economy grew at a high rate of 8.3% in 2011. Among others, the Northern \nProvince and its neighboring NCP are in the worst conflict-affected region in the country. With \nthe normalization of the economic and social  environment, economic prospects in the two \nprovinces demonstrate significant improvement. In 2010, the highest rate of growth (22.9%) was \nrecorded in the Northern Province, and a similar rate (20.3%) in the NCP. However, regional \ndisparity remains a feature of the economy. The share of gross domestic product is only 3.4% \nfor the Northern Province and 4.8% for NCP\u2014less than their share of the population. \n \n4.  Recognizing this, the government\u2019s development strategy emphasizes equitable access \nto infrastructure and services for all, to promote inclusive growth.4 The sustainability of recent \ndevelopment outcomes is at risk if the road connectivity cannot be improved in a timely manner. \nProlonged underinvestment during the conflict left the road network in a state of total disrepair. \nPeople in the region have poor and limited access to local markets and basic social services. \nMobility between the Northern Province and southern regions requires substantial travel time \nowing to the inadequate condition of the linking arterial roads. Poor road connectivity in Northern \nProvince and NCP has hindered the spread of economic activities and regional development. \n \n5.  In support of the government\u2019s national strategy, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved loans on 18 June 2010 for the Northern Road Connectivity Project (footnote 2). The \noriginal project is rehabilitating about 170 km of national roads and 140 km of provincial roads in \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The TA was provided in conjunction with the original project.

During  appraisal,  the total  project  cost  was estimated  at \n$173 million. ADB finances the original project through (i) a loan of $130 million from its ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR); and (ii) a loan of SDR16,080,000 ($24.4 million equivalent) from its \nSpecial Funds resources. The government finances $18.6 million of taxes and duties. The \noriginal project is performing well based on the following assessment:5  \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The delivery of expected outputs is satisfactory. \nThe construction works on national roads, provincial roads, and the offices of the \nNPRDD  will  be  completed  by  March  2013,  and  will  be  followed  with  3-year \nperformance-based maintenance of project roads. The original project is on track \nto meet the intended outcome of improved road connectivity within the Northern \nProvince and with the southern region of the country. \n(ii)  Satisfactory  implementation  progress.  The  implementation  progress  is \nsatisfactory. As of June 2012, all contracts have been awarded with a cumulative \namount  of  $108.15  million  (104.5%  of  the  projection).  The  cumulative \ndisbursement has reached $36.26 million (111.2% of the projection). \n(iii)  Satisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The \ncompliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  original  project  is \nproceeding satisfactorily. \n(iv)  Successful management of risks. The risks have been successfully managed. \nThe main lesson is that high implementation readiness will avoid delays for such \na project in the post-conflict area. To address the risk of post-project operation \nand  maintenance,  provisions  of  3-year  performance-based  maintenance  are \nincluded in all contracts. A road maintenance scheme is being established in the \nNorthern Province.6 \n(v)  On  track  rating. The original project has been rated on track in the project \nperformance rating for the last 12 months. \n \n6.  It is estimated that $20 million of proceeds of the original loan from ADB\u2019s OCR will \nbecome  surplus.  To  cover  additional  geographical  areas  and  consolidate  the  development \noutcomes, the government has requested ADB to scale up the original project with the surplus \nand additional financing. The overall project meets eligibility criteria for additional financing,7 \nwhich will help consolidate development outcomes by covering additional geographic areas and \nincreasing project beneficiaries. The modality of additional financing will enhance the intended \nimpact of the original project by utilizing the existing implementation arrangements to achieve \nresults expeditiously. \n \n7.  The overall project, including the original project and the additional financing, is in line \nwith  the  strategic  objective  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  as  agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB:  improving  connectivity  and  service  delivery  to  lagging \nregions, including the former conflict-affected regions of the country.8 The proposed additional \nfinancing is included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014.9 In the future, ADB\u2019s \nassistance will focus on (i) continuing to improve the road connectivity for the lagging regions \nand for important links, (ii) relieving the traffic congestion in the urban areas and on the trunk \n                                                 \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The government agreed to establish a mechanism in Northern Province to use at least 50% of the revenue from the \nvehicle license fees towards routine maintenance in the loan agreements. Such a mechanism will require approval \nof the elected Northern Provincial Council. Since the election has not been held, as an interim arrangement, the \nNorthern Provincial Council finances the road maintenance through a provision of its annual budget. \n7  ADB. 2011.

The overall project impact will remain\u2014balanced and inclusive growth in the Northern \nProvince. The overall project\u2019s immediate outcome will be improved road connectivity within the \nNorthern Province, and with the southern region of the country. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  With additional financing, the up-scaled project outputs are as follows: (i) about 280 km \nof national highways in the Northern Province and NCP are rehabilitated; (ii) about 260 km of \nprovincial roads in the Northern Province and NCP are rehabilitated, and selected bridge links \nare rehabilitated or replaced; and (iii) the offices of the NPRDD are rehabilitated.10 \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 13). In addition to the executing agencies and implementing agencies of the \noriginal project, the North Central Provincial Council and the North Central Province Road \nDevelopment Authority (NCPRDA) are involved for the rehabilitation of provincial roads in NCP. \n                                                 \n11 The project management expenses of the Road Development Authority (RDA), the Ministry of Local Government \nand Provincial Councils (MLGPC), and NPRDD will be funded by the original financing until 31 March 2013. \nAfterward, the additional financing will be used to fund the project management. For the Northern Central Province \nRoad Development Authority (NCPRDA), additional financing will be used to fund the project management from \nloan effectiveness. The allocation of the original loan for civil works will continue to be utilized for the additional \nscope until closed or up to the ceiling of $20 million. \n12 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points.

In conjunction with the original project, associated TA has been provided to strengthen \nthe capacity of the NPRDD on road asset management (footnote 2). The TA will be expanded to \nenhance the capacity of road agencies in road operation and maintenance by continuing the \nefforts of the original TA and previous TA in NCP.15 The TA will carry out the following additional \nactivities: (i) building the capacity of NPRDD and NCPRDA in administering performance-based \nmaintenance contracts with the road asset management system developed in previous TA; \n(ii) improving the awareness of the Road Development Authority (RDA), NPRDD, and NCPRDA \non how to design and implement gender-inclusive road projects; and (iii) raising the awareness \nof road users through training on road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \n18.  The cost of additional TA activities is estimated at $1 million, which will be financed by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide office space \nand counterpart staff from RDA, NPRDD, and NCPRDA. The TA will provide required consultant \ninput and necessary equipment and facilities. A consulting firm will be recruited to implement the \nTA. Individual consultants will be engaged as needed to facilitate the TA implementation. The \nconsultant will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time).

Manila. \n16 The TA closing date will be extended from December 2012 to December 2015. \n17 The scope includes both national roads to be financed by the surplus of Loan 2639-SRI, and those by the proposed \nadditional financing. \n18 Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Ministry  of  Environment,  Climate  Change  Secretariat.  National  Climate  Change \nAdaptation Strategy for Sri Lanka: 2011 to 2016. Colombo. \n19 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \noperating costs and travel time.20 The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range \nfrom 17.3% to 24.1% for additional national roads (footnote 17). The overall EIRR for the \nnational  roads  is  21.2%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  overall  national  road \nimprovement has an EIRR above 12%. The EIRRs for additional provincial roads range from \n12.1% to 36.3%. The overall EIRR for the provincial roads is 22.4%. The sensitivity analysis of \nthe overall provincial roads resulted in an EIRR above 12%. Individually, a few provincial road \nsections may have an EIRR below 12% if there is an adverse variation in costs and benefits. \nHowever, the inclusion of these provincial road sections is considered appropriate because they \nprovide essential accessibility to the rural and poor population in the interior areas. \n \n21.  The EIRRs of the national and provincial roads covered by the original project, additional \nscope,  and  both  combined  are  above  12%.  Therefore,  the  proposed  improvements  are \neconomically  viable.  In  addition  to  the  quantified  benefits,  the  project  will  bring  significant \nbenefits to the overall regional development. The project road will provide direct access to social \nservices, such as education and health facilities. The industry development will also benefit from \nthe improved national roads as the investment climate is upgraded by better connectivity to the \nsupply sources and markets outside the region. While such benefits are not quantified, they are \nthe project's contribution to economic development and poverty reduction. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  Policy and legal. RDA, the implementing agency for the national road component, is \nresponsible for the development and maintenance of the national highway network. RDA was \nestablished as a statutory authority with a separate legal personality by the Road Development \nAuthority Act in 1981. RDA\u2019s chairperson reports to the secretary of the Ministry of Ports and \nHighways (MOPH). \n \n23.  NPRDD, the implementing agency for the provincial road component in the Northern \nProvince,is responsible for the Northern Province\u2019s provincial road network in accordance with \n \nthe 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The director of NPRDD reports to Northern Province's \nchief secretary through the secretary of the provincial Ministry of Infrastructure Development and \nReconstruction. The Northern Province does not have an elected council. The chief secretary of \nthe Northern Province, who has wide provincial administrative authority, will chair the project \ncoordinating committee for monitoring provincial project implementation. \n \n24.  NCPRDA,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  provincial  road  component  in  NCP,  is \nresponsible for managing provincial roads in NCP. It is established through a provincial statute \nas a separate legal entity operating within NCP. NCPRDA is headed by a board of directors, one \nof whom is appointed as the chairperson. \n \n25.  Institutional capacity. RDA and NCPRDA have sufficient capacity, past experience, \nand institutional strength to implement the project. NPRDD's capacity has been strengthened \nthrough implementing the provincial road component of the current project, and enhanced by the \nTA for capacity development of NPRDD. \n \n26.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for the \nimplementing agencies\u2014RDA, NPRDD, and NCPRDA. All implementing agencies have prior \nand ongoing experience of implementing ADB-funded projects and have satisfactory capacity in \nterms of project financial accounting and knowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. RDA and \nNPRDD have, and NCPRDA will soon establish a dedicated project accounting and finance \n                                                 \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nteam  with  suitably  qualified  accountants.  RDA,  NPRDD,  and  NCPRDA  will  establish  and \nmaintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received and \nexpenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related financial statements in \naccordance with international auditing standards. \n \n27.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with \nthe relevant ADB guidelines. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time), \nthe Declaration of Asset and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975, and Permanent Commission to \nInvestigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No 19 of 1994 provide a legal basis to deal \nwith bribery and corruption. The auditor general also monitors procurement of the agencies, with \nspecial attention to procedural propriety in procurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOPH, the \nMinistry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC), RDA, NPRDD, and NCPRDA. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Poverty reduction and social impact. A poverty and social assessment of the project \narea found the project would provide communities with enhanced mobility and improved social \ninteractions. The project will have a short-term impact on poverty reduction by employing local \npopulation. These opportunities will increase livelihood opportunities for those depending on \noccasional  employment.  Furthermore,  the  project  will  prove  access  to  new  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities.  Improved  roads  will  help  the  rural  population  to  transport  their \nproducts to markets and obtain higher profit margins. It is estimated that 1.86 million people \nresiding in five districts will benefit from the project. The contracts for civil works will include \nmeasures to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for both men and women labors. \nThe contractors are required to comply with equal pay for equal work for men and women, \nhealth and safety at construction sites and labor camps, no child labor, and an awareness \nprogram for workers on the prevention of sexually transmitted infections.21 \n \n29.  Gender. Sri Lanka ranks midway on the United Nations gender-related development \nindex. However, in general, gender-related indicators in the northern and eastern parts of the \ncountry lag behind national levels. Women in project areas are frequent road users for family \ntasks. Improved road connectivity will provide better access to health services, higher levels of \neducation, economic opportunities, and social interactions. Reduced travel time will result in \nmore time on productive activities. No adverse impact on women was envisaged. A gender \naction  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  (i)  maximize  women\u2019s  access  to  project \nbenefits, (ii) provide opportunities to increase women\u2019s skills and income, and (iii) minimize \nsocial  vulnerability.  Practical  and  implementable  activities  have  been  incorporated.22 Key \nactivities  include  (i)  involving  women  in  civil  works,  (ii)  ensuring  road  safety  awareness in \nroadside communities, (iii) providing a pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly design, and (iv) building \nthe capacity of government agencies in improving gender-sensitivity of transport projects. A \ngender specialist will be engaged under the associated TA to support RDA, NCPRDA, and \nNPRDD in the overall implementation of the gender action plan. \n \n30.  HIV/AIDS. Sri Lanka has a low HIV prevalence rate although the number of reported \ncases has increased, in part because of improved access to testing facilities. Countrywide \n                                                 \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nresponses have included the establishment of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme, \nwhich helps to refurbish health clinic and establish outreach and awareness programs. The \nproject  has  incorporated  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks,  by  undertaking  awareness \nprograms for civil works contractors at construction sites, and for project-affected communities at \nprominent  village  locations.  Awareness-raising  activities  for  project-affected  persons  will  be \nconducted separately for men and women to address gender-specific issues. \n \n31.  Human  trafficking. Human trafficking is not a significant issue in the project area. \nCommunities with young widows and orphaned children have been identified as potential risk \ngroups. Awareness programs for human trafficking will be held in project-affected communities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified category B. Road improvements are \nwithin the existing right-of-way (footnote 17). Limited land acquisition and resettlement will be \nrequired on one national highway (AB019). It is estimated that 37 households (151 persons) will \nbe affected. The majority of these households will experience a limited impact, including loss of \nboundary walls, crops, and home gardens. One household, consisting of four persons, will lose \nmore  than  10%  of  its  productive  assets.  One  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s Land \nAcquisition Act of 1950, and the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy introduced in 2001.23 \nThe Environmental and Social Division of RDA will implement the resettlement plan. \n \n33.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples and is classified category C. \n \n34.  Environment. The project is classified category B. None of the project roads are located \ninside  protected  areas  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas  (footnote  17).  Three  initial \nenvironmental examination reports together with environmental monitoring plans (EMPs) have \nbeen prepared for the national roads, northern provincial roads, and north central provincial \nroads. Contract package-specific EMPs have also been prepared. The requirements of the \nEMPs and of the conditional clearance provided by the Central Environmental Authority have \nbeen included in the bidding documents and as part of the contracts. Anticipated environmental \nimpacts  include  small-scale  removal  of  trees;  occupational  health  and  safety  issues;  and \ngeneration of dust, noise, and drainage problems. These are mainly confined to the construction \nstage and can be addressed through mitigation measures. Details of consultations, feedback \nreceived, requirements for further consultation, and the grievance redress mechanism have \nbeen included in the initial environmental examination report.24  \n \n35.  The Environmental and Social Division of RDA, assisted by the project implementation \nconsultants, will monitor the implementation of the EMP for the national roads. The project \nimplementation  units  of  the  NPRDD  and  NCPRDA  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the social and environment safeguards for provincial roads, with support from \nthe project implementation consultants. Training and coordination workshops on environment \nsafeguards  and  EMP  implementation  will  be  conducted  for  implementing  agencies  and \ncontractors,  as  necessary.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  annually  and \nsubmitted to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website, as required by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for environment category B projects. \n                                                 \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The key risk is implementation delay. To mitigate the risk, detail design and bidding \ndocuments  have  been  prepared  in  advance  to  award  the  first  contract  shortly  upon  loan \neffectiveness. The overall risk assessment is medium without mitigation and low with mitigation. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n37.  The government, MOPH, and MLGPC have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies and frameworks including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government, MOPH, and MLGPC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $30,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nadditional  financing  of  the  Northern  Road  Connectivity  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n26  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR45,215,000 to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Northern Road \nConnectivity  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n23 August 2012 \n                                                 \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nPerformance Targets  Targets and  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  Baselines  Baselines   Mechanisms (Overall  Risks  \n(Current Project)  (Overall Project)   (Current Project)  (Overall Project)  Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact    By 2018:      Assumption \nBalanced and  Unchanged  Per capita annual  Unchanged  Publications of the  Policy directions of \ninclusive growth in the  income in Northern  Ministry of Finance and  the Government of \nNorthern Province  Province increases from  Planning  Sri Lanka\u2019s 10-Year \n$952 in 2009 to $1,688    Development \nand percentage of  Publications of the  Framework will \nnational average from  Ministry of Local  remain valid. \n50% to 80%  Government and   \nProvincial Councils  Risk \nGovernment \ninvestments are not \nadequate. \n \nOutcome    By project completion  By project completion    Assumption \n(2015):  (2017): \nImproved road  Unchanged  Travel time on project  Unchanged  Completion reports of  The government \nconnectivity within  roads reduced by an  RDA, NPRDD and  remains committed \nNorthern Province  average of 20% from  NCPRDA  to restoring and \nand to the southern  2010 in Northern    sustaining vital \nregion of the country  Province and North  Project performance  infrastructure in the \nCentral Province  monitoring system  Northern Province. \n     \nTravel time from  Completion reports of   \nColombo to Jaffna  RDA, NPRDD and \n(Northern Provincial  NCPRDA \ncapital) is reduced by   \n38% (from 13 hours in  Project performance \n2010 to 8 hours)  monitoring system \n   \nAccident rate (fatalities  Road Development \nby vehicle-km) reduced  Authority, Ministry of \nby 20% from 2010 rate  Highways and Road \n  Development \n ", "12   Appendix 1 \nPerformance \nPerformance Targets  Targets and  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  Baselines  Baselines   Mechanisms (Overall  Risks  \n(Current Project)  (Overall Project)   (Current Project)  (Overall Project)  Project)  (Overall Project) \nOutputs    By project completion  By project completion    Assumption \n(2015)  (2017): \n1.
