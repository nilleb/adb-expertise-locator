The \nProject  will  also  reassign  and  consolidate  responsibility  for  the \noverall  government  accounting  function  and  for  check  issuance \nwith the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). \n \nStrengthening  of  the  PAS  will  enhance  good  governance  by \nimproving  efficiency,  enhancing  accountability  and  transparency, \nand  contributing  to  more  effective  public  sector  management,  as \nwell  as  to  the  development  of  effective  fiscal  operations  and \nmacroeconomic  policy.  The  quality  of  governance  in  public \nfinance  management  is  critical  for  ensuring  expenditures  for \nprograms  targeting,  reducing  poverty,  preventing  corruption  and \nfraud  and  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  the  Maldives  to  external \nshocks. \n \nThe objectives are to (i) promote improved budget practices, thus \nenhancing  financial  management  as  well  as  the  development  of \neffective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic  policymaking; \n(ii) establish  accurate,  reliable,  and  timely  financial  reporting  to \nmeet  international  accounting  standards  by  eliminating  laborious \nmanual financial reporting systems, promoting accountability, and \nproviding  appropriate  financial  information  to  the  Government  for \neconomic decision making; and (iii) conduct more comprehensive \nand  updated  control  over  public  funds,  and  help  develop  a  cash \nmanagement  strategy \nto  rationalize  cash  movements  and \nholdings, especially for the atolls and islands. \n \nThe Project components include (i) restructuring the organization \nof ministries and departments (by establishing finance sections in \nministries,  assigning  accounting  and  internal  audit  function  to \nMOFT,  and  establishing  accounting  units  in  the  atolls  and \nislands); \nintroducing  core \ngovernment  funds;  chart  of  accounts;  a  ledger  structure;  and  a \nvoucher  system  for  ministries,  atolls,  and  islands;  and  preparing \nannual  financial  statements;  (iii)  streamlining  the  function  of  the \nMaldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA)  for  the  PAS  by  reassigning \nthe banking function to MMA, and establishing one public account; \nand (iv) supporting human resource development and training.  \n \n \n\n(ii)  strengthening \n\nthe  PAS  by \n\n\f \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $6.265  million \nequivalent, of which $4.576 million (73%) is the foreign exchange \ncost  and  $1.689  million  equivalent  (27%)  is  the  local  currency \ncost.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  SDR \n3,781,000 ($5 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources \nto  finance  80%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will \nfinance the costs of $1.265 million equivalent, comprising 20% of \ntotal project cost. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB loan of SDR 3,781,000 will have a repayment \nperiod  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nThe  Borrower  will  make  the  loan  available  to  MOFT  through \nappropriate budgetary allocations. \n \nUntil 30 June 2006 (6 months after the completion date)  \n \n31 December 2005  \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \nMOFT  will  have  overall  operational  responsibility  for  project \nmanagement.  The  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by \nthe  Minister  of  State  for  Finance  and  Treasury  or  the  Minister\u2019s \nappointee,  will  be  established  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the \nProject.  A  project  management  unit  will  be  established  in  MOFT \nwith day-to-day operational responsibility for project management. \n \nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Procurement  for  computer  software \nand  hardware  will  be  carried  out  using  international  competitive \nbidding procedures. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  implementation  of  a \ncomputerized  PAS  at  MOFT,  MMA,  ministries,  and  atolls; \n(ii) human  resource  development  and  training;  (iii)  support  for \ntender  selection  of  accounting  software  and  hardware  vendors; \n(iv) data and system support and security for computerization; and \n(v) support  to  the  treasury  division  and  Internal  Audit  Bureau  of \nMOFT.  About  91 person-months  of \ninternational  consulting \nservices  and  75 persons-months  of  domestic  consulting  services \nwill be required. Consultants to be engaged under the Project will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  quality-based  selection \nmethod will be utilized for consultant selection. ADB Management \napproved advance action for recruitment of consulting services.  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries  \n\nIntroducing  the  new  PAS  will  entail  the  following  main  benefits: \n(i) improving the quality, timeliness, and integrity of the accounting \nsystem  will  enhance  transparency  and  accountability,  and  thus \nstrengthen  governance;  (ii)  reliable  and  timely  information  on  the \nfinancial  position  of  the  Government  will  enable  the  Government \nto  conduct  more  competent  fiscal  policy  and  macroeconomic \nmanagement to reduce the vulnerability to external shocks due to \nthe  high  dependency  of  the  Maldivian  economy  on  imports  and \nlimited  income  derived  from  tourism  and  fishing;  (iii) reliable \ninformation on the fiscal status of the country will enhance lenders \nand investor confidence in the country; (iv) external reports will be \nprepared to meet internationally accepted accounting standards to \nenable  better  assessment  by  international  rating  agencies;  and \n(v) significant  reductions  in  idle  cash  holdings  of  ministries  and \natolls  will  lead  to  better  financial  returns  on  public  funds  through \nimprovements in fiscal discipline and cash management. \n \n\nfinance \n\nthe  relevant  public \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Major  risks  are  (i)  delay  in  enactment  of  the  public  finance  act, \namendments  to  Audit  Act,  and  the  public  enterprises  act;  and  in \nissuing \ninstructions;  (ii) delayed \ndecision  making  by  the  PSC  on  implementation  plans;  and \n(iii) delay in human resource development and training for primary \nand  supporting  staff.  To  mitigate  these  risks:  (i) the  Government \nhas  provided  assurance  that  MOFT  will  have  submitted  the  draft \npublic finance act, public enterprises act and the amendments to \nthe Audit Act (collectively referred to as the draft laws) to the Law \nCommission,  and  the  Law  Commission  will  have  submitted  the \ndraft  laws  (as  finalized  by  the  Law  Commission)  to  the  People\u2019s \nMajlis  before  loan  effectiveness;  (ii)  the  project  management  unit \nwill prepare necessary draft plans and documentation to assist the \nPSC  make  timely  decisions;  and  (iii) the  Project,  with  consulting \nsupport,  will  prepare  the  human  resource  development  strategy \nand conduct training needs assessment and the training program. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nHigh dependence of the Maldivian economy on imports, and limited income derived from \ntourism  and  fishing  exacerbates  its  vulnerability  to  external  shocks.  The  effects  of  external \nshocks are quickly transmitted to the poor.  Hence, despite the significant economic and social \nprogress  achieved,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  still  substantial,  particularly  in  the  highly \ndispersed, small, and sparsely populated islands. This poses major structural challenges for the \ncountry as articulated in the Government\u2019s Sixth National Development Plan (2001\u20132005). The \nGovernment's  public  expenditures  account  for  more  than  40%  of  the  gross  domestic  product. \nThus, public sector intervention is a powerful tool for economic and social development. \n \nThe Government's growth and poverty reduction strategy focuses on strengthening the \n3. \nmacroeconomic  framework  and  good  governance  in  the  public  sector,  supporting  human \ndevelopment,  and  improving  the  policy  environment  for  the  public  and  private  sectors. \nEstablishing  a  modern  public  administration  system,  governed  by  a  comprehensive  and \ntransparent  set  of  laws,  and  an  impartial  and  competent  judiciary  is  prioritized  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  agenda,  while  efficient  control  and  utilization  of  public  money  is \nunderscored as a means to attaining the maximum benefits from the development program. \n\nThe  operational  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Maldives \n4. \nsupports poverty reduction through a combination of pro-poor growth, social development, and \ngood  governance  initiatives.  For  pro-poor  growth,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  fostering  regional \ndevelopment.  To  raise  the  level  of  social  development,  ADB\u2019s  focus  is  on  assisting \npostsecondary education and skills development. To support good governance, ADB is focusing \non  developing  improved  information  access  and  public  sector  connectivity,  and  improving  the \neffectiveness  of  public  sector  management.  Introduction  of  a  new  public  accounting  system \n(PAS)  will  enhance  good  governance  by  improving  efficiency  and  control  of  public  money, \nenhancing  accountability  and  transparency,  and  contributing  more  effectively  to  public  sector \nmanagement  as  well  as  the  development  of  effective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic \npolicy.  Once  funds  that  are  dispersed  throughout  the  system  are  clearly  identified  and \nconsolidated,  they  could  then  be  utilized  for  programs  targeting  poverty  reduction  and \npreventing  corruption  and  fraud, 1  which  mostly  affect  the  poor.  Moreover,  the  quality  of \ngovernance  in  public  finance  management  is  critical  in  reducing  the  vulnerabilities  of  the \nMaldives to external shocks. \n      \nSince  1994,  the  Government  has  been  collaborating  with  aid  agencies  to  develop  a \n5. \nmore  efficient  public  finance  system.  More  recently,  the  public  expenditure  and  public \naccounting  systems  were  enunciated  as  issues  for  immediate  attention  in  the  Sixth  National \nDevelopment  Plan.  Under  a  World  Bank  initiative,  ADB  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n\n                                                 \n\n1   The  proposed  PAS  is  designed  to  strengthen  control  over  public  funds,  and  enhance  accountability  and \ntransparency  in  public  finances,  which  will  improve  financial  management  and  prevent  corruption  and  fraud.  A \nsingle public account and check issuance unit will tighten control over spending beyond budget appropriation. The \nInternal  Audit  Bureau,  being  established  under  the  Project,  will  monitor  legitimacy  of  public  financial  operations, \nand  timely  and  accurately  prepared  and  audited  financial  statements  will  allow  review  and  assessment  of  the \nproper usage of public funds. \n\n\f \n2 \n\n \n\n(IMF)  are  preparing  the  first  public  expenditure  review  for  the  Maldives.  The  objectives  of  the \nreview  are  to  assess  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  spending  program \nand its institutional aspects, particularly in light of poverty reduction, and to recommend a reform \nagenda for improving public sector spending. Preliminary findings of the review underscore the \nneed for a new PAS, as proposed by this Project. \n \n6. \nThe  public  accounting  and  auditing  system  needs  to  be  streamlined  to  enable  public \nmoney to be managed in an efficient and accountable manner. ADB has been working with the \nGovernment  for  the  past  5  years  as  its  lead  partner  in  achieving  this  goal.  ADB  provided \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 to the Government from August 1997 to December 1998 to conduct \nan  assessment  of  the  existing  PAS  and  to  identify  its  major  limitations,  inadequacies,  and \nweaknesses.  This  was  followed  by  TA3 to  identify  the  legal,  institutional,  and  human  resource \nrequirements for introducing a new PAS.  \n \n7. \nIn  April  2001,  after  reviewing  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  these  studies,  the \nGovernment  decided  to  adopt  the  design  and  the  supporting  reform  strategies  for  introducing \nthe new PAS.4  During the Country Strategy and Program Mission in May 2001, the Government \nasked  ADB  to  provide  a  project  preparatory  TA5 for  the  proposed  Project.  The  TA  vetted  the \ndetails of how a new PAS could interface with and update the existing accounting system with \nas  little  disruption  to  the  economy  as  possible,  through  a  critical  review  of  proposed  PAS \nmodels,  system  requirements,  and  capabilities  in  the  Maldives.  The  findings  of  the  TA  team \nwere  then  discussed  in  detail  with  the  Technical  Advisory  Team  and  the  Ministerial  Level \nAdvisory Group. The feedback received was included in the final TA report. Building on the TA \nrecommendations and findings, a fact-finding mission6 was undertaken from 7 to 18 April 2002 \nfor the Project. This report is based on the understandings reached with the Government during \nfact-finding. The project framework is detailed in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators, and Analysis \n\n8. \nThe  current  PAS  is  rudimentary  and  does  not  achieve  the  overall  objectives  and \nconsistent performance criteria required for PAS. These objectives and criteria include provision \nof  accurate  and  adequate  information  in  a  timely  manner  on  the  financial  position,  budgetary \ncommitments  and operation results of the funds (surplus or deficit positions) monitored by the \naccounting  groups  of  ministries  and  atolls,7 in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting \nprinciples; compliance with finance-related constitutional, statutory, and legal requirements and \ncontractual  provisions  of  the  country;  and  streamlined  financial  reporting  to  enable  budgetary \nand accounting functions to be complementary and to effectively integrate elements of financial \nmanagement and audits. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n2  ADB. 1997. Technical assistance for Capacity Building of the Maldives Audit Office. Manila.  \n3  ADB. 1999. Technical assistance for Capacity Building for Maldives Public Accounting System. Manila. \n4  Approval was given following a recommendation by the Ministerial Level Advisory Group comprising the minister of \nstate for finance and treasury, minister of state and auditor general, minister of planning and national development, \nattorney general, minister of state for presidential affairs, and general manager of the Maldives Monetary Authority.   \n\n5  ADB. 2001. Technical assistance for Preparing the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System. Manila. \n6   The mission consisted of J. Tsunoda, Financial Markets Specialist; Y. Elhan, Economist; S. Lakshman Athukorala, \nFinancial  Management  Specialist;  and  R.  O\u2019Sullivan,  Counsel.  Hideaki  Imamura,  Programs  Officer  assisted  the \nmission in the field. \n\n7  \u201cAtoll\u201d refers to a group of islands consisting of a coral reef surrounding a lagoon. The Maldives has 26 atolls, but \nfor  administrative  purposes,  20  atolls  and  Male\u2019  make  up  the  21  administrative  units  of  the  Republic  of  the \nMaldives. \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n3\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nCapacity Constraints \n\n \nPublic sector staff involved with the accounting function work at a relatively rudimentary \n9. \nlevel  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  a  manual,  line-budget  oriented  accounting  system.  To \nensure  adequate  implementation  of  the  new  PAS,  the  skills  mix  will  have  to  be  substantially \nupgraded  not  only  to  implement  the  new  accounting  practices,  but  also  for  financial \nmanagement,  preparation  and  analyses  of  financial  statements,  and  their  use  as  inputs  into \nmacroeconomic policymaking. Other external funding agencies have not assisted in this area as \nthe  absorptive  capacity  of  the  Government  is  limited.  While  the  Project  will  provide  focused \ncapacity building in phases to the relevant staff vis-\u00e0-vis workshops and on-the-job training, the \npace  of  the  process  will  largely  be  determined  by  the  existing  and  absorptive  capacity  of  the \nstaff being trained. \n \n10. \nA  new  PAS  would  not  have  been  effective  without  the  necessary  legal  foundation. \nHence, under the capacity-building TA (footnote 3), three key bills for the public finance act, the \namendments of the Audit Act, and the public enterprise act were drafted and are being reviewed \nby the Maldivian legislative authorities for adoption. The bills aim to define the legal framework \nwithin  which  the  transparent  and  efficient  implementation  of  the  new  PAS  can  be  enforced, \nultimately  ascertaining  an  alignment  of  the  newly  introduced  rules  with  practices.  Many  of  the \nconcepts, some of the terminology included in the bills are novel. Hence, a training workshop on \nthese new bills, in conjunction with the Public Service Division of the President's Office, as part \nof  the  Seminar  on  Financial  Management,  was  held  in  June  2002,  for  a  group  of  senior \ngovernment officials and financial managers of public sector organizations.  \n \n\n2. \n\nScope for Improvement of the Existing Public Accounting System   \n\n \nThe  existing  PAS,  which  was  introduced  more  than  three  decades  ago,  is  subject  to  a \n11. \nnumber of constraints. The financial legislative framework is not comprehensive. Currently, the \ncountry  has  an  outline  legal  framework  for  regulating  control  of  public  finances  including  the \nPAS.  The  framework  components  are  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  1997,8 \nand in operational terms, the Financial Regulations.9 Under the current PAS, no annual financial \nstatements  regarding  the  Government\u2019s  financial  position  and  status  are  reported  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Majlis,10 and no audited financial statements are prepared. The annual accounts and \ninformation  on  Government  finances  are  presently  included  in  budget  papers 11  and  the \nGovernment  Budget  in  Statistics  Handbook.12 In  fact,  no  policies  identify  the  ownership  and \nresponsibility  for  the  accounting  function,  and  provide  for  a  data  entry  system.  Only  a  limited \n\n                                                 \n\n8  The  Constitution  provides  in  Chapter  X\u2013The  Auditing  and  Maintenance  of  Accounts  of  the  State,  for  certain \naccounting  functions  to  be  performed  by  the  auditor  general.  However,  under  Article  127  of  the  Constitution,  the \nauditor  general  is  obliged  to  act  on  the  advice  of  the  President  in  this  regard.    Accordingly,  ultimate  power  and \nauthority for determining the manner and form of the PAS rests, under the Constitution, with the President. \n\n9  These are implicitly authorized by Article 127 of the Constitution. These regulations were last revised in 1992, and \nare modified by President\u2019s circulars. However these regulations are not explicitly authorized or recognized under \nany specific legislation.    \n\n10  People's Majlis is the National Assembly of the Maldives.  \n11  Budget papers are usually prepared in December each year for submission to the People\u2019s Majlis by the Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury (MOFT) and comprise the past year\u2019s performance and current year\u2019s status and proposed \nfuture budget proposals.  \n\n12  The Government Budget in Statistics Handbook is normally issued in the first quarter of each year, reflecting the \n\ncontents of the budget paper and the analysis of budget expenditure and revenue. \n\n \n\n\f \n4 \n\n \n\naccounting  reporting  structure  exists.  Only  the  Treasury  General  Account  is  used  for  public \nmoney  recording  purposes;  however,  the  account  does  not  reflect  all  transactions  being \nmonitored  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT).  And  the  current  PAS  used  in  the \natolls is highly inefficient, leading to excessive holdings and movements of cash.13 \n \n\n3. \n\nLife of the Project  \n\n \n12. \nThe Project is to be implemented over 3 years. While this may appear to be a relatively \ntight schedule, the pace of implementation is important. The Maldivian economy urgently needs \na new PAS. Support for the Project is strong throughout the Government, and the momentum \nmust  not  be  lost  during  implementation.  The  dependence  on  information  technology  and \ncomputers,  while  facilitating  a  less  labor-intensive  and  more  user-friendly  introduction  to  the \nsystem,  necessitates  a  reasonable  pace  of  transition  from  the  existing  to  the  new  PAS.  The \nspecialized accounting software and hardware to be used must still be at par with the rest of the \nworld by the time the new PAS is operational. Designed carefully over the last 2 years in close \nconsultation  with  the  Government,  the  current  timetable  is  realistically  achievable  from  both \ntechnical and absorptive capacity perspectives at this time. However, the Project will be closely \nmonitored  by  ADB  and  the  Government;  three  monitoring  missions  and  two  comprehensive \nreviews  of  the  Project  are  scheduled.  If  during  implementation,  a  longer  implementation \nschedule appears to be needed, then both ADB and the Government will explore the availability \nof additional funding or TA from ADB and other donors. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n13. \nThe ultimate goal of the Project is to improve the quality of governance by introducing a \nnew  PAS  with  institutional  reorganization  and  capacity  building  aiming  to  enhance  efficiency, \nto  public  sector \ntransparency;  and  contributing  more  effectively \naccountability,  and \nmanagement;  as  well  as  the  development  of  effective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic \npolicy.  \n \nThe  objectives  are  to  (i)  promote  improved  budget  practices,  thus  enhancing  financial \n14. \nmanagement  as  well  as  the  development  of  effective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic \npolicymaking; (ii) establish accurate, reliable, and timely financial reporting to meet international \naccounting  standards  by  eliminating  laborious  manual  financial  reporting  systems,  promoting \naccountability, and providing appropriate financial information to the Government for economic \ndecision making; and (iii) conduct more comprehensive and updated control over public funds \nand  help  develop  a  cash  management  strategy  to  rationalize  cash  movements  and  holdings, \nespecially  at  the  atolls  and  islands.  The  Project  covers  nation-wide  Government  agencies \ninvolved in the PAS in Maldives including ministries, atoll offices, island offices14 and will provide \nthe financial reporting framework for public enterprises. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n13 Cash held in safes is estimated at Rf20 million and the total held in the Bank of Maldives on the account of atoll \nentities is estimated at a further Rf20 million (based on 31 December 1998 figures). The total amount is considered \nto be at least twice the amount reasonably needed to fund expenditure in the atolls. \n\n14 Island offices are established for inhabited islands, and currently there are 198 island offices. \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n5\n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  features  of  the  proposed  PAS  are  summarized  in  Appendix  2. 15  The  project \n15. \ncomponents  include  (i)  the  restructuring  organization  of  ministries  and  departments  by \nestablishing  finance  sections  in  ministries,  assigning  accounting  and  internal  audit  function  to \nMOFT, and establishing accounting units in the atolls and islands; (ii) strengthening the PAS by \nintroducing core government funds; chart of accounts; a ledger structure; and a voucher system \nfor ministries, atolls and islands; and preparing annual financial statements; (iii) streamlining the \nfunction of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) in the PAS by reassigning banking function \nto MMA, and establishing one public account; and (iv) supporting human resource development \nand training.  \n\n  \n1. \n\n \n\nOrganizational Restructuring of Ministries and Departments  \n\na. \n\nEstablishment of Finance Sections in Ministries \n\n \nPresently 176 spending units are submitting budgets to MOFT. By introducing the new \n16. \nPAS, each ministry will be able to consolidate its own budget for presentation to MOFT as well \nas consolidate its accounting function by establishing a finance section. It will also enhance the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the overall administration of each ministry.  \n \n17. \nUnder  this  component,  a  finance  section  in  charge  of  the  accounting  and  budgeting \nfunctions  will  be  established  under  the  relevant  administrative  division  of  each  ministry.  The \nadministrative  division  of  each  ministry  will  comprise  sections  dealing  with  finance,  human \nresources,  and  other  supporting  services.  The  finance  section  will  be  responsible  for  the \naccounting  functions  within  the  ministry,  which  includes  purchasing,  accounts  receivable, \naccounts  payable,  and  reporting  and  budgeting,  and  will  consolidate  the  ministry\u2019s  budget  for \nsubmission to MOFT.     \n \n \n \n\nTransfer of the Accounting Function from MMA to MOFT, and   \nStrengthening of MOFT\u2019s Audit Functions \n\nb. \n \n\n \n \n\n \nThis  component  will  support  reorganization  of  MOFT,  to  provide  an  adequate \n18. \norganization  structure  for  transferring  the  accounting  function  from  MMA  to  MOFT  and  for \ndeveloping  an  internal  audit  function.  This  component  will  also  establish  the  treasury  division \nand internal audit bureau. \n \n19. \nThe treasury division will consist of an accounting office, a cash management and fund \nrelease office, and a borrowing and debt management office. The accounting office will examine \nand certify vouchers, handle data entry operations, process general ledger and journals entries, \nhandle  check  production,  and  maintain  computer  software  and  hardware.  Accordingly,  the \naccounting  office  will  include  an  examination  section,  a  data  input  section,  a  general  ledger \nprocessing  section,  a  check  production  section,  a  cashier\u2019s  section,  and  a  computer  section. \nThe accounting office will require 25 to 30 staff.   \n \n\n                                                 \n\n15 The proposed PAS is similar to the system adopted in Australia and Singapore. The PAS models in Mauritius and \nSeychelles were also studied by the consultants under TA (footnote 3) and the voucher system and establishment \nof finance sections in ministries were incorporated into the design. \n\n \n\n\f \n6 \n\n \n\nInternal auditing provides an independent, objective assurance and consulting capacity \n20. \ndesigned to add value and improve an organization\u2019s operations. The internal audit bureau will \nreview, appraise, approve and report on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and \nfinancial performance and resource utilization under MOFT. It will report to the Minister of State \nfor Finance and Treasury, as well as to each ministry and department it audits. These reports \nwill be available to the Maldives Audit Office and the President\u2019s Office. About 20 to 25 staff will \nbe needed.  \n   \nBy  establishing  the  internal  audit  bureau  in  MOFT,  the  Maldives  Audit  Office  will  take \n21. \nover  the  role  of  a  supreme  audit  institution.  It  will  be  responsible  for  certifying  the  annual \nfinancial statements of the Government, and be the Government\u2019s external auditor, reporting to \nthe People\u2019s Majlis through the President\u2019s Office.   \n \n\nEstablishment of Accounting Units \n\nc. \n \n\n \n\n \n\ni. \n\nAtoll Accounting Units \n\nThis component will help establish atoll and island accounting units.   \n\n22. \n \n \n \n23. \nThe atoll accounting units will take over the functions currently performed by individual \natoll entities, and create imprest accounts to provide cash funds for expenditures and to receive \nrevenue collection. This will centralize the expenditure and revenue function in one unit on each \natoll, compared with the existing decentralized management of revenue and expenditure. This \norganizational  and  functional  change  will  strengthen  financial  control,  and  reduce  the  cash \nholdings and the physical movement of cash. In addition, a voucher system will be introduced to \nreplace the existing system of manually prepared books. \n \n \n \n24. \nThe island accounting units will take over the functions currently performed by individual \nisland  entities  located  away  from  the  atoll  offices  and  create  a  subimprest  account  for  each \nisland  (from  the  atoll  imprest  account)  and  introduce  a  voucher  system  to  replace  the  existing \nsystem.  \n \n\nIsland Accounting Units \n\nii. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening of the PAS \n\n \n \n\n \n\na. \n\nBasis of Accounting and Operational Mode of the PAS \n\n \n25. \nThe  basic  design  and  operational  mode  of  the  Project  is  to  develop  a  computerized, \ndouble-entry, cash-basis PAS with a central ledger and check production unit under the control \nof MOFT.  \n \n26. \nThe current system focuses on the control of public money using a manual accounting \nsystem  operated  using  9  accounting  books.  By  introducing  a  computerized  PAS,  reliable  and \ntimely reporting of the financial status based on accurate transaction recording will be enabled. \nThe  existing  single-entry  system  does  not  produce  adequate  financial  information  for  overall \nreporting  purposes.  Double  entry  is  the  basis  for  producing  standardized  financial  statements \nwith  accuracy  and  reliability.  Accountability  and  transparency  of  financial  recording  and \nreporting will thus be enhanced. A cash-basis accounting system will provide all the necessary \nfinancial  information  for  external  reporting  of  government  financial  transactions.  Furthermore, \nsuch  a  system,  which  is  less  complex  than  an  accrual  accounting  system  and  requires  less \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n7\n\nextensive accounting skills, is also more consistent with the current Government capacity. The \ncentralized  accounting  system,  which  is  generally  associated  with  a  cash-basis  system,  will \ntypically  provide  for  one  main  financial  report  to  be  prepared.  Under  the  proposed  centralized \nsystem,  MOFT  will  maintain  the  general  ledger.  MOFT  will  be  responsible  for  the  accounting \nprocesses as well as check production for the Government.   \n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nCore Government Funds  \n\n \n\nc. \n\n \nThis  component  will  establish  four  core  Government  funds,  which  will  group  the  public \n27. \nfunds  for  financial  information  processing.    The  core  funds  will  be  the  consolidated  revenue \nfund,  loan  and  capital  works  fund,  advance  fund,  and  trust  fund;  all  will  be  linked  to  a  single \nbank account at MMA.16  \n \n28. \nThis  framework  ensures  compliance  with  two  accounting  principles:  (i)  expenses  of  an \nongoing nature are resourced from taxation and other recurrent revenue sources, while capital \nworks (and therefore assets) are funded from a loan fund or recurrent revenues set aside for the \npurpose;  and  (ii)  financial  information  is  clear  and  more  transparent  to  improve  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial management.  \n \n \n \n29. \nThe chart of accounts and structure of the ledger determine the manner in which data is \nclassified,  sorted,  and  aggregated  for  financial  reporting.    A  structure  of  hierarchical  reporting \nlevels  is  proposed  in  this  component,  which  will  accommodate  the  existing  reporting \nrequirements, and allow expansion to accommodate future requirements as they arise.  \n \n30. \nThe proposed ledger structure will comprise four categories with 11 ledgers: (i) fund and \ncentral  accounting  with  a  fund  ledger,  a  fund  general  ledger,  and  a  fund  sub-ledger; \n(ii) ministry/appropriation  with  a  ministry  appropriation  ledger  and  a  spending  unit  ledger; \n(iii) agency  discretion  with  a  program  ledger,  a  project  ledger,  and  a  cost  center  ledger;  and \n(iv) MOFT  analysis  with  a  input/revenue  classification  ledger  (RL9), 17  an  IMF  government \nfinance statistics (GFS) economic type/revenue classification ledger (RL10),18 and an IMF GFS \nfunctional  classification  ledger  (RL11). 19 The  ledger  structure  and  chart  of  accounts  for  the \nproposed  computerized  PAS  will  be  designed  to  ensure  that  (i)  all  accounting  and  internal \n\nChart of Accounts and Proposed Ledger Structure \n\n                                                 \n\n16 The  consolidated  revenue  fund  will  be  the  main  operating  fund  of  the  Government.  All  recurrent  revenues,  i.e., \ntaxes,  import  duties,  casual  and  other  government  revenues  must  be  credited  to  this  fund,  while  all  recurrent \nexpenditures will be met from this fund through appropriations. The loan and capital works fund will encompass all \ntransactions made by the Government of a capital nature. All loans, borrowings, and onlending of monies are also \naccounted  for  through  the  ledger,  including  any  monies  borrowed  on  a  long-term  basis  to  fund  recurrent  budget \ndeficits. All grant funds and donations provided to finance capital projects are also accounted for within this fund. \nThe advance fund will address urgent and unforseen expenditures, for which there is no provision in current year\u2019s \nappropriations,  with  the  approval  of  MOFT  and  will  cover  repayable  advances  to  fund  a  business  activity  or \nenterprise.  The  trust  fund  will  account  for  all  moneys  of  governmental  or  private nature  held  in  trust,  and  all \ntransactions against those moneys.   \n\n17 This  ledger  provides  for  a  comprehensive  classification  system  of  the  objectives,  or  nature  of  all  expenditures \n\n(inputs), and for all revenues. \n\n18 This ledger provides for a coding structure that allows extraction of information in accordance with IMF\u2019s economic \ntype  classification  of  expense,  transactions  in  nonfinancial  assets,  and  classification  of  revenue,  thus  enabling \nconsistent  data  presentation  in  the  Government\u2019s  budget  papers  with  IMF\u2019s  internationally  accepted  reporting \nstandard.  \n\n19 This ledger provides for a coding structure in accordance with IMF\u2019s functional classification of budget as published \n\nin IMF\u2019s GFS. \n\n \n\n\f \n8 \n\n \n\ninvestment  management \ncontrol  requirements  are  met,  (ii)  public  bank  account  and \nrequirements are satisfied, (iii) a budgetary control and enforcement regime is provided, (iv) all \nMOFT management information requirements are satisfied, (v) all proposed statutory reporting \nrequirements are met, (vi) all Government external reporting and internal management reporting \nrequirements are satisfied, and (vii) appropriate reports for the completion of the annual budget \npapers are produced including strategic budget sector data for analysis purposes aiming for the \nprogram budgeting to be introduced seamlessly. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nMinistries, Departments, Atolls, and Islands \u2013 Voucher System  \n\n \n \n \n31. \nThe existing system of account books in ministries, departments, atolls and islands will \nbe  replaced  by  a  voucher  system,  that  will  produce  records  to  accommodate  a  centralized \ndouble-entry  accounting  system  to  be  generated  and  maintained  in  the  MOFT  central \naccounting system. The proposed public finance act20 will empower delegated persons to incur \nexpenditure  and  receive  funds,  and  will  introduce  prescribed  forms,  vouchers,  and  on-line \ncomputer reports from the ledger system, which will replace the existing system of hand-written \nbooks. \n \n32. \nCash  funding  will  be  provided  by  an  imprest  system  through  the  atoll  offices.  Atoll \nentities (schools, hospitals, courts, etc) receive their budget allocations from their respective line \nministry,  but  their  cash  requirements  will  be  met  from  the  atoll  office  imprest  advance,  either \nfrom an imprest bank account or an imprest safe. A journal entry will be posted to the central \nledger to record the specific revenue or expenditure transaction. The central ledger will form the \nbasis for ledger reports to the entities and the annual financial statements published by MOFT.  \n \n33. \nFor  the  islands,  a  subimprest  account  structure  is  proposed.  Funds  held  in  the  bank \naccounts or in safes for atoll entities located away from the atoll office will be transferred to a \nsubadvance  at  the  island  office,  which  will  be  replenished  from  the  atoll  imprest  account.  The \nrecoupment voucher for replenishment will provide the basis for a journal entry to be posted to \nthe central ledger at MOFT. \n \n \n \n34. \nThe  objective  of  government  financial  reporting  is  to  provide  the  principal  users  of \ngovernment financial reports with timely and accurate information that meets their requirements.  \nCurrently, annual accounts and financial information are not produced. This project component \nis  designed  to  enable  preparation  of  such  financial  statements,  and  the  supporting  legislative \nframework  will  mandate  submission  of  these  financial  reports  to  the  People\u2019s  Majlis  for  their \nconsideration. The list of the proposed annual financial statements is provided in Appendix 3.   \n \n\nPreparation of Annual Financial Statements \n\ne. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nStreamlining of the MMA\u2019s Function in the PAS \n\n \n35.  MMA, since its inception, has been undertaking the role of the Government accountant \nas well as its banker. This project component will (i) delineate the responsibilities of Government \nand  MMA  by  transferring  the  accounting  function  to  MOFT,  and  (ii)  reassign  the  banking \n\n                                                 \n\n20 The  legislative  framework  supporting  introduction  of  the  new  PAS  includes  the  public  finance  act,  and  the  public \nenterprises act, and the amendments to the Audit Act. This legislation is expected to be submitted to the People\u2019s \nMajlis during the October 2002 session. \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n9\n\nfunction  with  MMA  by  establishing  one  public  account  for  better  control  of  public  funds.  In \nstreamlining MMA\u2019s function in the new PAS, four interim steps will be undertaken. \n \n36. \nEstablish  One  Public  Account  Supported  by  Appropriate  Legislation.  The  public \naccount  is  to  replace  the  existing  1,600  government  bank  accounts  currently  held  by  MMA. \nMoreover,  as  the  Treasury  General  Account  upon  which  the  current  system  operates  will  be \nwith a consolidated revenue fund reflected in the ledger. \n \nReview  Government  Bank  Accounts,  and  Determine  the  Balance  to  be  Carried \n37. \nForward into the Public Account. The nature and ownership of funds in the 1,600 government \nbank  accounts  held  by  MMA  will  be  identified  and  the  respective  balances  transferred  to  the \npublic account. The many individual government bank accounts will then be closed. \n \n38. \nReview the MMA Ledger, and Determine the Balances to be Carried Forward into \nthe MOFT Ledger. A review of MMA\u2019s ledger will be carried out to identify balances that are to \nbe  carried  forward  to  the  central  general  ledger  held  at  MOFT.  The  ledger  accounts  for  the \ngovernment  ministries  are  held  in  MMA\u2019s  books  and  will  be  reconciled  with  the  ministries\u2019 \naccounts at the time of turnover to MOFT.  \n \n39. \nReview of Other Matters That Will Impact On the New PAS. Outstanding debts owed \nby the ministries to MMA for foreign exchange purchases will need to be properly documented \nand assigned to the relevant ministries prior to implementing the new PAS.  \n\n Human Resource Development and Training \n\n \n4. \n \n40. \nThe successful implementation of the new PAS is dependent on the existence of trained \nsupport  staff  capable  of  putting  the  procedures  into  practice  under  the  new  organizational \nstructure;  and  the  aptitude  of  officers  to  interpret  and  take  appropriate  actions  based  on  the \noutputs  of  the  system.  Sustainability,  correct  operation,  and  possible  future  development  will \nrequire  that  competent  staff  are  available.  At  the  same  time,  the  PAS  will  impact  on  other \nministries, departments, and atolls that provide financial returns to MOFT.21 This component will \nsupport  the  training  needs  for  MOFT  personnel  undertaking  activities  related  to  this  Project, \ntogether with those of any other agency submitting financial data. \n \n41. \nTraining needs will be assessed; the human resource needs of both primary and support \npersonnel will be examined, and the training activities prioritized. In the short term, staff should \nbe  trained  to  implement  the  new  PAS  system,  while  training  related  to  the  creation  of  new \ninstitutional  structures  that  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  new  systems  would  be \nconsidered  in  the  longer  term.  Moreover,  preliminary  consultations  with  stakeholders  suggest \nthat 3\u20135% of the current employees  (in total less than 50 people) in the accounting field may \nneed  to  be  utilized  elsewhere  in  government  services.22 Given  the  level  of  their  training  and \nprofessional  experience,  this  transition  is  expected  to  be  relatively  seamless.  However,  to \nensure that the current employees are appropriately redeployed within the Government, training \n\n                                                 \n\n21 The  scope  of  the  Project  has  been  shared  with  senior  and  middle  management  of  ministries,  departments  and \natolls  for  enhancing  public  awareness  since  the  design  stage  of  the  Project  through  implementation  of  Capacity-\nbuilding  TA (footnote  3).  In  October  2000,  the  first  Ministerial  Level  Advisory  Committee  was  held  to  outline  the \ndesign  of  the  Project  and  necessary  strategies  for  introducing  the  new  PAS.  The  Government  held  the  second \nawareness  meeting  in  October  2001.  The  third  awareness  workshops  were  held  during  24-25  June  2002  in \nassociation with the President\u2019s Office focusing on the change of the legislative framework. \n\n22 Redundancy or retrenchment is not expected. This has not been an employment practice by the Government. \n\n \n\n\f \n10 \n\n \n\nneeds assessment will be conducted for each staff member affected by the Project. The training \nneeds  assessment  will  also  consider  any  additional  training  for  reskilling  that  may  be  needed \nbefore these staff could be absorbed by other government entities. Based on the training needs \nassessment, a strategy for developing human resources will be devised and implemented. \n \n42. \nThe  strategy  for  human  resource  development  will  comprise  (i)  designing  and \nimplementing  a  fast-track  career  planning  program  to  ensure  that  planning  and  financial \nmanagement  throughout  the  public  service  are  managed  effectively;  (ii)  establishing  a \ncompetency  framework  for  core  accounting,  budgeting,  and  planning  positions  (including \nsupporting  indicative  job  description;  (iii)  developing  revised  service  conditions  including \nincentives  for  rewarding  performance  for  the  accounting,  budgeting,  and  planning  cadres \nconsistent  with the  practices in the  public service conditions of the Government, ensuring that \ngood  staff  are  recruited  and  retained,  and  that  positions  are  filled  by  competent  officers;  and \n(iv) setting  establishment  levels  for  all  accounting,  budgeting,  and  planning  functions  in  the \npublic service based on the PAS. \n \nPreliminary  estimates  indicate  that  955  staff 23  will  have  to  be  trained,  consisting  of \n43. \n408 staff  from  ministries  and  departments  and  547  from  atolls  and  islands.  The  training  for \nimplementing  the  new  PAS  will  include  the  financial  legislative  framework  and  instructions, \naccounting, planning and budgeting, auditing, computer skills, and management. \n \n44. \nThe training component of the Project will focus on (i) training key personnel during the \npreimplementation stage encompassing formal training on the PAS structure, as well as on-the-\njob training including secondment to a similar PAS agency overseas; (ii) developing a train the \ntrainer  program  to  deal  with  the  training  of  accounting  staff  especially  in  atolls  and  islands; \n(iii) establishing  a  training  facility,  with  adequate  equipment,  within  MOFT  to  deal  with  the \naccounting  training  needs  within  government  during  and  after  project  implementation;  and \n(iv) establishing  a  training  team  operating  from  this  training  facility,  to  implement  training \nprograms  to  improve  the  financial  management  and  accounting  skills  of  government  officers \ninvolved with the PAS, which will ensure sustainability and future development of public finance, \nmanagement, and accounting skills. \n\nThe  Project  includes  several  important  features  that  are  being  introduced  or  enhanced \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n\n45. \nunder the new PAS.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCash Management \n\n \n46. \nA  single  public  bank  account  and  centralized  accounting  system  offers  significant \nadvantages over the present system of multiple accounts. It will provide a large, central pool of \ncash  that  can  be  managed  and  invested  in  a  range  of  short-  and  long-term  investments.  This \nproject  component  will  support  the  development  of  investment  strategies  where  a  mix  of \ninvestments will be undertaken to ensure that sufficient cash is available to meet requirements, \nwhile keeping the reserve of idle and uninvested cash to a minimum.   \n \n47. \nInvestments are to be structured to provide short-term liquidity, and maintain a positive \ndaily  account  balance  with  a  sufficient  safety  margin.  Daily  investment  decisions  (whether  to \n\n                                                 \n\n23 A survey was conducted on the training requirements of ministries and atolls (Footnote 3). \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n11\n\nincrease  investments  in  short-term,  highly  liquid  investments,  or  to  draw  upon  them)  will  be \nunderpinned by an appropriate decision support model that calculates estimated net daily cash \nrequirements, given daily expenditure and revenue data from the central accounting system. A \nsingle  government  bank  account  and  a  clear  investment  strategy  will  result  in  significant \nadditional interest revenue for the Government. The investment strategy will be based on policy \ndecisions  regarding  the  types  of  investments  that  can  be  made  with  the  central  pool  of  funds, \nincluding investments in foreign markets and short-term money markets. \n \n\nComputerization and Information Technology  \n\n2. \n \n48. \nThe  proposed  PAS  can  only  be  properly  maintained  with  sufficient  backup  from \ncustomized  computerization  of  the  process.  This  project  component  will  support  such \ncomputerization. At present, only 10 personal computers (PCs) are available for budgeting and \naccounting  activities  in  MOFT;  they  are  either  standalone  or  exist  in  small  local  peer-to-peer \nnetworked  groups.  All  data  are  kept  and  reports  generated  using  spreadsheets.  Apart  from  a \nsingle pension database, no database management systems currently exist. Although usage is \nmostly  rudimentary,  all  government  agencies  utilize  computers.  Moreover,  a  plan  to  network \nMOFT into a Windows-based networking environment is already under way. Under this plan, to \nbe completed in 2002, a local area network with basic networking facilities such as file sharing \nand E-mail with a dedicated connection to the Internet is envisaged. The plan also includes the \nprocurement of 32 additional PCs within 3 years for MOFT, of which 10 will be allocated to the \naccounts department, in tandem with the phased implementation schedule of the new PAS.24  \n \n49. \nThe  computerized  PAS  will  incorporate  all  the  functionality  of  the  central  accounting \nsystem  proposed  for  the  Government.  The  system  will  be  capable  of  fully  supporting  the \ncentralized double-entry system of the PAS, adopting a phased approach to computerize the full \nsystem.  \n \nThe implementation of the computerized PAS will take place in three phases. In the first \n50. \nphase,  only  MOFT  will  have  direct  access  to  the  computerized  accounting  system,  while  the \nother ministries, atolls, and islands will prepare the vouchers based on the ledger structure and \nchart of accounts, and provide them to MOFT. All data entry will take place in MOFT, with hard \nor soft copies of reports needed by other government agencies sent manually or via E-mail. The \nsecond phase will allow access to the computerized PAS by other ministries and agencies, but \naccess  will  be  restricted  to  on  line  viewing  of  their  account  details.  Web  servers  and  dial-up \nservers  should  be  in  place  before  the  initiation  of  this  phase.  On  line  data  entry  by  other \nagencies into the computerized PAS will commence in phase three. Agencies will be able to log \nin to the system and update their records. The timing of each phase will be determined based \non the pace of training (on accounting, financial management, etc.) necessary for the relevant \npersonnel  to  implement  the  system  and  the  ease  with  which  the  new  PAS  can  replace  the \nexisting methodology. \n \n51. \nThe  accounting  software  package  will  be  customized  by  the  vendor  to  address  the \nexisting needs and modalities of the Maldivian economy, data entry, and generation of various \nforms in Thaana (local script) as well as English. Thaana is right-to-left oriented as opposed to \nthe western method of left-to-right data entry. \n\n                                                 \n\n24  The  hardware  and  application  purchase  survey  was  conducted  under  TA  (footnote  5)  and  included  in  its \ninformation technology report. The Project includes a purchase of 80 PCs comprising 20 PCs for the Accounting \nOffice of MOFT, 10 PCs for the training function at MOFT, and 50 PCs for other agencies. \n\n \n\n\f \n12 \n\n \n\n \n52. \nThe  computerized  accounting  system  will  adopt  the  following  operational  principles.  It \nneeds to be completely secure to ensure reliability and data integrity of the system. A suitable \nmechanism  should  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  no  loss  of  data  or  unauthorized  access  occurs; \ndatabase  servers  should  reside  in  secured  rooms  with  all  possible  measures  to  minimize \naccidents;  backup  servers  should  reside  in  a  different  room  if  not  a  different  building;  and  all \nnecessary  tools  to  avoid  data  loss  such  as  appropriate  antivirus  software,  transaction \nmanagement servers, etc. should be in place. Firewalls and intrusion detection software have to \nbe  in  place  and  under  24-hour  surveillance,  and  any  intrusion  attempts  attended  to,  where \npossible recorded and appropriate legal actions taken. For the long-term integrity of the system, \nlocal information technology (IT) experts, who could maintain and safeguard the system, will be \ntrained  during  implementation,  overseen  by  international  IT  consultants.  The  step-by-step \nconnectivity, starting from a passive form, and gradually enabling connections to other networks \nof  government  agencies  will  ensure  that  necessary  security  measures  are  in  place  for  each \nstep. \n \nThe  implementation  schedule  of  the  IT  Development  Project 25  was  also  taken  into \n53. \nconsideration  while  preparing  the  implementation  schedule  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  IT \nDevelopment  Project  is  expected  to  establish  a  network  that  will  connect  government  and \nparastatal agencies (including Vilingili and Hulhule islands) in Male\u2019 and 20 atolls by installing a \nfiber optic cable, enabling them to share information electronically with a view to improving the \nefficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  sector  management  by  2004.  The \ninstallation  and  operationalization  of  the  new  PAS  has  been  synchronized  with  this  schedule. \nThe  completion  of  the  government  telecommunications  network  and  the  PAS  will  mutually \nsupport  each  other\u2019s  objectives.  The  PAS  will  be  one  of  the  applications  that  all  government \nagencies  will  need  to  use.  The  government  network  is  expected  by  2004,  coinciding  with  the \ncomputerization  and  on-line  enquiry  stages  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  will  provide  a \nplatform  to  promote  electronic  public  service.  The  availability  of  updated  information  on  the \ngovernment  network  would  also  help  the  computerized  PAS,  and  provide  all  agencies  with  a \nsecure and easy means for connecting to the PAS. The fiber optic backbone would ensure easy \nand  fast  connectivity  to  the  PAS.  Some  of  the  other  applications  would  include  (i)  updated \npopulation statistics, information on all civil servants, etc. to be used in the budget management \nmodule to estimate annual budgetary requirements; and (ii) updated records of companies and \nbusiness  establishments  and  to  maintain  an  updated  list  of  suppliers,  to  facilitate  ease  of \ndelivery and contacts, and to be used by the Department of Inland Revenue to keep their data \non  taxes  up-to-date  for  future  introduction  of  the  business  profit  tax  and  property  rental  value \ntax;  and  (iii)  online  access  to  banks,  and  use  by  MMA  to  facilitate  electronic  funds  transfer, \nwhich is a requirement of the computerized PAS. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n54.  \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $6.265  million  equivalent,  of  which  $4.576 \nmillion  (73%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.689  million  equivalent  (27%)  is  the  local \ncurrency cost. The total cost estimate includes physical and price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand  interest  during  the  implementation  period.  Details  on  the  project  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n25 ADB. 2001.

MOFT will be the Executing Agency for the Project, with overall operational responsibility \nfor  project  management.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  State \nfor  Finance  and  Treasury  or  the  Minister\u2019s  appointee,  will  be  established  prior  to  the \ncommencement  of  the  Project.  The  composition  of  the  PSC  will  include  director  generals,  or \nabove,  from  the  President\u2019s  Office;  MMA;  Audit  Office;  and  ministries  such  as  Planning  and \nNational Development, Atolls Administration, Health, Education, Home Affairs, Communication, \nand  Science  and  Technology;  and  the  Department  of  External  Resources.  MOFT  will  provide \nthe  secretarial  services  for  the  PSC.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly,  or  more  often  as \nrequired, and in conjunction with ADB review missions, to oversee, provide policy guidance, and \nensure efficient and effective implementation of the Project.  \n \n57. \nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  in  MOFT  with  day-to-day \noperational responsibility for project management. A project director appointed from MOFT and \nacceptable to ADB will head the PMU. With the support of the consultants, the PMU will prepare \nnecessary  draft  plans  and  documentation  to  assist  the  PSC  in  making  timely  decisions  or \nmaking recommendations for the higher authority of the Government for approval, with regard to \nproject  implementation,  including  (i)  a  software  tender  plan  and  purchase  and  installation \ndecision,  (ii)  a  hardware  tender  plan,  and  purchase  and  installation  decisions;  (iii)  closure  of \nexisting  bank  accounts  with  MMA  (about  1,600)  and  transferring  balances  to  the  new  public \naccount;  (iv)  an  accounting  design  plan  (chart  of  accounts  and  ledgers  for  MOFT,  ministries, \nand  atolls);  (v) annual  financial  statements  plan;  (vi)  a  MOFT  reorganization  plan;  (vii)  a \nministries reorganization plan for the public accounting and budgeting functions; (viii) a human \nresource skills assessment and career plan for staff involved in public accounting and budgeting \nfunctions;  (ix)  a  staff  plan  for  said  staff;  (x) a  training  plan;  (xi) accounting  software  and \nimplementation  and  customization  plan;  (xii)  a  pilot  agency  voucher  system  implementation \nplan;  (xiii)  PAS  implementation  plan  for  ministries;  (xiv)  an  atolls\u2019  and  islands\u2019  PAS \nimplementation plan; (xv) a project phase I batching system for the MOFT plan; (xvi) a project \n\n \n\n\f \n14 \n\n \n\nphase 2 on-line enquiry plan; and (xvii) a project phase 3 on-line data entry plan. During project \nimplementation,  the  PMU  will  also  monitor  and  provide  monthly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation to the PSC and ADB. \n  \nThe technical advisory team will continue to operate with key members being technical \n58. \nexperts from the Audit Office, MMA, the proposed financial controller and chief accountant, as \nwell as any other members, as and when required. It will be chaired by the deputy minister of \nMOFT or a senior official of MOFT and will provide technical advice and support to the PMU.  \n \n59. \nis included in Appendix 5. \n\n An organization chart showing project implementation and management arrangements \n\n \nImplementation Period \n\n \n\n2. \n \n60. \nThe Project will be implemented over 3 years commencing in January 2003 and ending \nin  December  2005.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  6.  During  the \ninception  of  the  Project,  the  project  framework  will  be  reviewed  and  elaborated  by  the \nGovernment with assistance from the consultants incorporating the detailed project outputs and \nassociated performance targets. The performance management system to be implemented by \nthe Project will track the performance targets in the project framework. The consultants will also \nassist  the  Government  develop  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  linking  the  outputs  in  the \nproject  framework  to  a  time-bound  plan.  The  schedule  will  reflect  the  major  milestones  and \nthematic aspects such as project review, the human resource inputs from the Government, and \nthe  areas  of  consultant  contribution.  The  project  framework  and  the  implementation  schedule \nwill be used subsequently to monitor project progress and performance. \n\n \n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nProcurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n61. \nfor  Procurement.  Procurement  for  computer  software  and  hardware  will  be  carried  out  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Tentative  procurement  packages  are  provided  in \nAppendix 7. The vendor of the software and hardware needed during the implementation of the \nnew  PAS  will  provide  a  comprehensive  maintenance  contract  for  the  first  year  including  parts \nand service support, necessary backup, and updates especially for the software. \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n \n62. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  implementation  of  computerized  PAS  at \nMOFT, MMA, ministries, and atolls; (ii) human resource development and training; (iii) support \nfor tender selection of accounting software and hardware vendor; (iv) data and system support \nand  security  for  computerization;  and  (v)  support  to  the  treasury  division  of  MOFT.  About  91 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  75  persons-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  a  firm(s).  Full \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  submitted  for  the  selection.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants  are  provided  in  Appendix  8.  Consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  Project  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements for engaging domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nThe quality-based selection method will be utilized for consultant selection. The Project \n63. \nwill  introduce  a  new  accounting  system  to  the  public  sector,  involving  various  echelons  of  \ngovernment both horizontally (various levels of hierarchy in each user department) and vertically \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n15\n\n(various  levels  of  public  entities  in  Male\u2019,  the  atolls  and  the  islands).  The  Project  will  have  an \nimpact throughout the public infrastructure from the President\u2019s Office to the island accounting \noffices. Moreover, the Project necessities the use of highly specialized skills in the field of public \naccounting,  relevant  legislature,  policymaking,  and  institutional  and  staff  capacity  building. \nStrengthening the PAS and improving budget practices are prior agenda items for the Maldives. \nHence,  the  choice  of  the  consultants  to  carry  out  the  Project  requires  prioritization  of  their \ntechnical capabilities to carry out the tasks outlined in Appendix 8. All ADB-financed contracts \nwill ensure that the services provided do not violate any industrial or intellectual property right of \nany third party. \n \n64. \nADB  Management  has  approved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consulting  services \non the understanding that such advance action does not necessarily commit ADB to finance the \nProject. The PMU will start shortlisting consultants. ADB will assist the PMU by providing a long \nlist of consultants qualified for the assignment. \n \n\n5.    Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n \n65. \nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  Project,  which  will  be \nprepared  by  the  qualified  accountant.  The  Project\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The PMU will provide ADB with copies of \nthe audited accounts and financial statements, together with the report of the auditors not more \nthan  9  months  after  the  end  of  the  financial  year.  The  PMU  will  also  provide  ADB  with  the \nunaudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  not  more  than  3  months  after  the  end  of  the \nfinancial year. The PMU will submit regular progress reports on project implementation to ADB. \nWithin  3  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  project \ncompletion  report  on  the  execution  and  initial  operation  of  the  facilities  established  under  the \nProject, including costs of establishment, operation, and compliance with loan covenants.  \n \n\n6.    Disbursement Arrangements \n \n66. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  either \nthrough  disbursement  procedures,  commitment  procedure  or  reimbursement  procedure  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001,  as  amended  from \ntime to time. MOFT will, immediately after the loan effectiveness, open and maintain a project \nimprest  account  for  the  PMU  to  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  for  seamless \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  initial  amount  to  be  allocated  to  the  imprest  account  is \n$50,000. Imprest funds will be used essentially for small expenditure locally incurred, including \nincremental project administration costs.  \n \n\n7.   \n\nProject Performance Management and Evaluation  \n\n \n67. \nThe  project  performance  management  and  evaluation  system  comprises  (i)  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  to  ascertain  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  beneficiaries;  and \n(ii) performance monitoring and evaluation, which will measure the efficiency of the Project.  \n \n68. \nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  include  data  on  (i)  level  of  financial  returns  on \ninvested  public  funds,  (ii)  the  number  of  government  bank  accounts  at  MMA,  (iii)  the  ease  of \naccess  to  financial  information  by  government  agencies,  and  (iv)  the  level  of  staff  resources \nused for government accounting functions including gender parity. The PMU will be responsible \nfor maintaining these data and evaluating project benefits.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n16 \n\n \n\nPerformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU  in  conjunction \n69. \nwith  ADB  monitoring  and  review  missions.  They  will  monitor  (i)  the  project  implementation \nschedule, (ii) project costs, (iii) delivery of project components, and (iv) PAS sustainability.  \n \nThe consultant will assist the PMU with project performance management by preparing \n70. \ndraft regular progress reports incorporating performance indicators of the Project with respect to \nimprovement of the financial management system and capacity building of PAS-related staff. \n \n\n8.   \n\nProject Review  \n\nthe \n\n \n The  Project  has  a  number  of  components  and  subcomponents  to  be  implemented  by \n71. \nvarious  government  departments.  To  ensure \ntimely  and  satisfactory  progress  of \nimplementation, the Project will be monitored closely at three levels by the project consultants, \nthe PMU they report to, and ADB. In addition to daily collaboration between the consultants and \nthe PMU, the consultants will submit monthly progress reports to the PMU, and ADB. ADB will \nfield monitoring missions after about 6 months (after software and hardware are procured and \nutilization  begins),  18  months  (after  phase  1  of  the  Project  starts  at  MOFT),  and  32  months \n(after  phase  3  starts)  after  loan  effectiveness.  In  addition,  two  comprehensive  reviews  of  the \nProject will be undertaken by the Government and ADB about 12 (after phase 1 is introduced in \nthe atolls and the islands) and 24 months (after phase 2 is introduced) after loan effectiveness. \nThe  progress,  performance,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  will  be  critically \nassessed  during  these  reviews.  If  any  weakness  or  slippages  in  the  original  implementation \nschedule are identified, the review will recommend remedial measures for consideration by the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  with  a  view  to  incorporating  appropriate  measures  to  address  any \nslippage. Prior to these reviews, MOFT will provide ADB with evaluation reports on the progress \nof the Project and any problems encountered in its implementation. The findings of the reviews, \nincluding an assessment of the progress made under the Project, will be discussed in tripartite \nmeetings of the consultant team, PMU, and ADB. If required, appropriate corrective measures \nwill  be  formulated  during  these  discussions  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and \nachievement of the objectives. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\n72. \nThe  main  benefit  of  the  new  PAS  will  be  improved  governance.  The  new  PAS  will \nestablish a system of tracking receipts and expenditures of all public transactions at the central, \natoll, and island level. Detailed financial/accounting data will then be used to generate financial \nstatements  to  guide  public  sector  management  in  the  short  and  medium  term,  as  well  as \nmacroeconomic  planning  in  the  longer  term.  Ultimately,  the  new  PAS  will  improve  efficiency, \nand enhance accountability and transparency, by achieving the overall objectives and meeting \nthe  performance  criteria  required  of  a  well-functioning,  up-to-date  PAS.  The  beneficiaries  of \nthese improvements will all be citizens who will benefit from more efficient management of the \nnation\u2019s  resources.  The  quality  of  governance  in  public  finance  management  is  critical  for \nfacilitates  participatory,  pro-poor  policies  as  well  as  sound \npoverty  reduction,  which \nmacroeconomic  management.  Upgrading  governance  by  introducing  the  new  PAS  will  ensure \nthe  transparent  use  of  public  funds,  promote  effective  delivery  of  public  services,  and  provide \ngood  public  expenditure  management  necessary  for  fiscal  discipline,  economic  growth,  and \nequity.   \n \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n17\n\nThe  Project  will  also  entail  the  following  main  benefits  relevant  to  good  governance: \n73. \n(i) reliable  and  timely  information  on  the  financial  position  of  the  Government  will  enable  the \nGovernment  to  conduct  more  competent  fiscal  policy  and  macroeconomic  management  to \nreduce  the  vulnerability  to  external  shocks,  (ii) reliable  information  on  the  fiscal  status  of  the \ncountry will enhance the confidence of lenders and investors in the country, (iii) the preparations \nof  external  reports  to  meet  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards  will  enable  better \nassessment  of  the  economic  situation  by  international  rating  agencies,  and  (iv)  significant \nreductions  in  idle  cash  holdings  of  ministries  and  atolls  will  lead  to  better  financial  returns  on \npublic funds through improvements in fiscal discipline and cash management.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis   \n\nA  benefit-cost  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  Project  (Appendix  9).  The  economic \n74. \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  not  computed  since  the  majority  of  the  benefits  accruing  from  the \nProject are not quantifiable. A benefit that will have a significant fiscal impact is better financial \nreturns  on  public  funds  through  improvements  in  fiscal  discipline  and  cash  management.  The \nexistence of idle cash will be minimized if not totally eliminated. Excess funds can be properly \nchanneled  to  more  effective  investment.  Gains  will  also  be  made  in  efficiency  and  savings  in \nstaff  time,  which  are  a  direct  result  of  reducing  the  time  of  handling  more  than  1,600  bank \naccounts in favor of a single public bank account. Substantial time saving can also be achieved \nwhen the existing detailed record-keeping system is replaced by a simplified and cost-effective \nfully publicized system. Internal control procedures will also be improved. This will directly result \nin  the  reduction  of  misappropriation  and  overspending  of  government  funds.  Accountability  for \npublic funds will increase, resulting in informed spending. \n \n75. \nIn  addition  to  the  gains  from  better  financial  management  of  Government  funds, \nsubstantial  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  from  improved  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability  of  the  public  sector.  Another  benefit  is  the  enhanced  quality  of  external  reports \nthat  would  meet  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  The  ability  to  prepare \nindependently  audited  government \nin \ninternational credit ratings and help the country to borrow funds in international markets at more \nfavorable terms in the long run.  \n \n \n76. \nThe Project is expected to pave the way for the new PAS to be connected to the national \nnetwork  enabling  on  line  inquiry  and  printing  of  various  financial  reports  of  the  government \nspending  units.  This  connectivity  will  bring  improvements  to  the  timeliness  and  quality  of \ndecision  making.  The  availability  of  reliable  and  timely  information  in  a  centralized  system  will \nresult  in  more  informed  and  efficient  allocation  of  resources.  In  more  general  terms,  the \nproposed PAS will improve the entire financial management process.  \n \n \nThe  costs  that  will  be  incurred  during  project  implementation  will  include:  (i)  consulting \n77. \nand  computer  software  and  hardware  (ii)  additional  staff  requirements  especially  in  the  initial \nstages  of  project  implementation,  such  as  staff  for  data  entry  in  MOFT  during  phase  1; \n(iii) system maintenance, and (iv) retraining employees.  \n \nC.  \n\nfinancial  statements  will \n\nSocial Impact \n\nimprovements \n\nlead \n\nto \n\n78. \nThe  enhanced  legislative  framework  associated  with  the  new  PAS  and  the  targeted \nsound  public  finance  management  will  contribute  to  the  Government's  ongoing  efforts  to \nimprove  transparency,  accountability,  efficiency,  and  accuracy  of  public  sector  management. \nThe  new  PAS  will  also  enhance  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  budget  for,  invest  in,  and  monitor \n\n \n\n\f \n18 \n\n \n\neffectively  economic  and  social  development  activities.  These  factors  would  in  due  course \nsupport more robust economic growth, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. The major part \nof the Project is assistance to strengthen the PAS in the Government. No infrastructure is to be \nbuilt.  Only  computer  equipment  and  software  are  to  be  purchased.  The  Project  will  not  trigger \nADB\u2019s policies for involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. \n \n79. \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  criteria,  participation  of  all \nstakeholders,  labor  issues,  gender  issues,  and  potential  risks  and  vulnerabilities  were \nconsidered in assessing the possible social and poverty impact of the Project on the Maldivian \neconomy.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  at  various  levels  is  strong  and  stakeholders  (i.e. \ngovernment  ministries,  departments,  and  institutions)  endorse  the  introduction  of  a  more \nstreamlined  PAS.  Key  stakeholders  such  as  the  Audit  Office,  MMA,  and  MOFT  especially \nexpressed  their  strong  support  for  the  new  PAS  to  the  Mission.  However,  more  awareness \nneeds  to  be  built  of  the  structure  and  expected  benefits  of  the  new  PAS,  as  well  as  how  it  is \nexpected  to  interface  with  the  existing  accounting  system  during  the  early  stages  of \nimplementation. \n \n80. \nSound  planning  and  delivery  of  training  on  the  PAS  is  essential  for  its  successful \nimplementation.  The  training  opportunities  within  the  new  PAS  will  have  an  overall  positive \nsocial  impact,  through  capacity  building  of  the  labor  force  involved.  Training  will  not  only  be \ndelivered  in  the  initial  stages  of  implementation,  but  thereafter  as  well,  so  that  there  is  a \ncontinuous  supply  of  competent  staff  for  the  government  is  ensured  with  the  required \nmanagement, budgeting, accounting and computer skills.  \n \nThe Maldives has a progressive policy on gender in which achieving gender equality and \n81. \nequity  are  national  objectives.  Preliminary  analysis  indicates  that  women  constitute  61%  of \ngovernment  staff  involved  in  administering  and  monitoring  public  expenditures.  Moreover, \nwomen\u2019s  labor  force  participation  is  projected  to  improve  significantly  since  the  country  has \nachieved  gender  parity  in  primary  and  secondary  educational  participation  maintaining  gender \nequity  in  the  intensive  training  for  the  PAS  will  necessitate  that  women  receive  due  access  to \ntraining and other opportunities of the Project.  \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n82. \nFirst,  a  significant  potential  risk  is  the  delay  in  enactment  of  the  public  finance  act, \namendment  to  the  Audit  Act,  and  the  public  enterprise  act,  and  in  issuing  the  relevant  public \nfinance instructions. The preparation for draft acts and instructions in English and Dhivehi have \nbeen under way by extending work of consultants under the capacity-building TA (footnote 3). \nThe  drafts  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  third  quarter  of  2002,  with  submission  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Majlis expected in the fourth quarter of 2002 or early 2003. The Government assures \nthat MOFT will have prepared these drafts and instructions and will have submitted them to the \nLaw  Commission  for  approval  and  the  Law  Commission  will  have  submitted  the  drafts  (as \nfinalized by the Law Commission) to the People\u2019s Majlis before loan effectiveness. \n \nSecond, relating to the project management, another risk is decision making by the PSC. \n83. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  necessary  draft  plans  (17  plans  as  described  in  para.  57)  and \ndocumentation to assist the PSC in making timely decisions or recommendations for the higher \nauthority  of  the  Government  for  approval,  if  necessary.  The  background  reasons  for  delayed \ndecision  making  are  considered  to  include:  (i)  less  frequent  opportunities  for  decision-making \nmeetings,  (ii)  lack  of  project  administration  capacity  in  preparing  for  those  meetings,  and \n(iii) unwillingness  to  change  and  uncertainty  about  introducing  a  new  system.  If  the  decision \n\n \n\n\f  \n\n \n\n19\n\nmaking  is  not  conducted  in  a  timely  manner,  it  may  cause  a  significant  delay  for  project \nimplementation. \n \n84. \nThird,  capacity  building  for  relevant  supporting  staff  in  MOFT,  ministries,  atolls,  and \nislands  is  critical  for  successful  project  implementation,  which  will  put  the  procedures  into \npractice  under  the  new  organization  structure  as  well  as  enhance  the  aptitude  of  officers  to \ninterpret  and  take  appropriate  actions  based  on  the  outputs  of  the  system.  The  Project  will \ninitially begin the training needs assessment in the second quarter following commencement of \nimplementation;  it  will  examine  the  human  resource  needs  of  both  primary  and  support \npersonnel,  and  training  activities  in  the  short  term  to  implement  the  new  PAS  as  well  as  in \nmedium term to create new institutional structures to ensure sustainability. The initial phase of \nhuman  resource  development  and  training  components  will  last  until  the  fourth  quarter  before \nstarting the first phase of the Project when MOFT will have direct access to the computerized \naccounting  system.  Successful  capacity  building  during  the  first  half  of  the  implementation \nperiod is essential.  \n \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n85. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n86. \n \n\nThe Government will: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nto  concerned  ministries \n\nensure  the  establishment  of  the  treasury  division  within  6  months  after  loan \neffectiveness; \nensure the remaining MOFT positions agreed with ADB, are filled as per Human \nResource  Gap  Study  dated  July  2002  (footnote  5)  within  6 months  after  loan \neffectiveness; \nprovide  the  PMU  with  adequate  budgetary  and  staff  resources  for  its  effective \noperation during project implementation in suitable office accommodation; \nfor \nresources \nallocate  appropriate  budgetary \ntransportation  and  lodging  for  participants  attending  training  sessions  and \nworkshops related to the Project; \nprovide the required counterpart funds in a timely manner for the Project during \nimplementation;  and  ensure  all  necessary  authorizations,  including  presidential \norders, are granted and approvals are given to ensure timely implementation of \nthe Project; \nensure  the  installation  of  the  project-related  computer  facilities  with  relevant \nministries and atolls has commenced within 9 months of loan effectiveness;  \nensure the commissioning of the project-related computer facilities with relevant \nministries and atolls has been completed by 24 months of loan effectiveness; \nensure that MOFT has prepared for approval the financial instructions relating to \nthe  implementation  of  the  amendments  to  the  Audit  Act,  the  public  finance  act \nand the public enterprise act within 1 month of their passage; \nensure  that  under  the  new  PAS,  no  bank  accounts  containing  public  funds  are  \nopened or operated without the written consent of MOFT; \nensure that the transfer of balances from MMA to the central ledger at MOFT will \nbe subject to audit certification; and \n\n \n\n\f \n20 \n\n \n\nB. \n\n87. \n \n\n \n\n(xi) \n\nensure that all purchases of foreign exchange are paid for and debited from the \nrelevant  ministry\u2019s  appropriate  expenditure  code  before  foreign  exchange  is \nreleased. \n\n \nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nAs conditions for the effectiveness of the Loan, the Government has agreed that: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe PSC will be established and equipped with the services of an administrative \nassistant,  and  representatives  from  concerned  ministries  and  agencies  will  be \nappointed to the PSC; \na  project  director,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  a  minimum  of  two  staff  will  be \nappointed to the PMU; \n(iii) \na financial controller or the chief accountant will be appointed to MOFT; and \n(iv)  MOFT will have submitted the draft public finance act, public enterprises act and \nthe  amendments  to  the  Audit  Act26 (collectively  referred  to  as  the  draft  laws)  to \nthe  Law  Commission,  and  the  Law  Commission  will  have  submitted  the  draft \nlaws (as finalized by the Law Commission), to the People\u2019s Majlis. \n\nVI.    RECOMMENDATION \n\n88. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 3,781,000 to the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the \nPublic Accounting System Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTadao Chino \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       President \n\n \n \n27 August 2002 \n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n26 Audit Act is to be amended to include necessary cross-reference to accommodate the proposed provisions of the \n\npublic finance act and the public enterprise act. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nGoals  \n \n(cid:1)  Improve the quality of \ngovernance by \nintroducing the new \npublic accounting system \n(PAS) with institutional \nreorganization and \ncapacity building aiming \nto enhance efficiency, \naccountability, and \ntransparency, and \ncontribute more \neffectively to public \nsector management as \nwell as the development \nof effective fiscal \noperation and \nmacroeconomic policy. \n\nPurposes  \n \nThe introduction of the new \nPAS will enable: \n(cid:1)  improved budgetary \n\ncontrol framework, and \nstreamlining financial \nmanagement; \n\n(cid:1)  accurate, reliable, and \n\ntimely financial reporting \nto meet international \naccounting standards for \nproviding financial \ninformation to the \nGovernment for \neconomic decision \nmaking; and  \n\n(cid:1)  more comprehensive and \nupdated control over \npublic funds,  \ndevelopment of  cash \nmanagement strategy will \nassist to rationalize cash \nmovements and holdings, \nespecially in the atolls and \nthe islands. \n\nOutputs  \n1.

Substantial \nchange  is  needed  if  the  Government  is  to  achieve  its  expected  outcomes  under  the  reform \nagenda.  The  proposed  system  is  designed  to  bring  about  improvements  in  the  levels  of \nefficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in the management of public funds and other public \nwealth.  The  objective  of  this  Project  is  to  improve  the  public  accounting  system  (PAS)  and \nenable  the  development  of  efficient  and  effective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic  policy. \nThe Project includes: (i) setting up a new PAS based on double-entry accounting principles; and \n(ii) training of government employees involved in the various aspects of the Project.  \n\nGains In Efficiency \n\n1. \n \nThe  proposed  PAS  will  bring  about  fundamental  improvements  in  efficiency  and \n2. \neffectiveness to the existing accounting system of the Government. The new accounting system \nwill relieve the central bank, Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), from performing the dual role \nof a government banker and administering government accounting functions. This new system \nwill enable proper segregation of functions and duties by transferring the accounting functions of \nGovernment to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) while the banking functions remain \nwith MMA. \n \nThe  new  system  will  also  enable  government  ministries  and  departments  to  do  away \n3. \nwith a number of accounting records currently being kept in the existing system without proper \nmonitoring and coordination by MOFT. Analysis of the project preparatory technical assistance \nconsultants show that based on the current workload a saving of at least 27% of total staff hours \nwould be achieved thereby creating an economic saving of approximately Rf9.4 million per year. \nAssuming that the government budget will grow in real terms at the same rate as in the last 5 \nyears  or  so,  the  savings  will  increase  substantially.  Existing  staff  can  be  redeployed  in  other \nareas of importance or retrained, or the staff complements could be reduced by natural attrition, \nthereby making the government operations more efficient and cost effective.  Implementation of \nthe Project as part of the reform process could require additional human resources, which may \nbe met in part by surplus staff from the finance sections. \n \n\n2. \n\nBetter and Timely Decision Making \n\n \n\n4. \nThe main aim of the existing system is to control the budget through the treasury general \naccount  maintained  at  MMA.  More  than  60%  of  the  monthly  reports  that  are  required  to  be \nsubmitted  to  MOFT  by  the  various  government-spending  units  arrive  significantly  late.  Such \ninformation is critical for good and timely decision making and required by a number of users. \n \n5. \nBy  2004,  a  national  computer  network  will  likely  be  established  under  an  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  financed  project.  This  network  together  with  the  proposed  PAS  will \npave  way  for  the  new  PAS  to  be  connected  to  the  national  network,  enabling  on-line  enquiry \nand printing of various financial reports by the government-spending units. This connectivity will \nbring improvements to the timeliness and quality of decisions made.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\n3. \n\nTransparency and Accountability \n\n \n\n \n\nThe centralized PAS supported by the legislative amendments will provide much needed \n\n6. \ntransparency and accountability to the management of public finance. \n\n4. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\n7. \nQualified  financial  management  capacity  is  lacking  in  MOFT.  Hence,  development  of \nqualified personnel to manage the proposed accounting system will be critical to the success of \nthe  Project.  Good  cash  or  treasury  management  and  analytical  skills  will  be  essential \ningredients to successfully manage the PAS and achieve the expected outcomes. \n\n5. \n\nImproved Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms \n\n \n \n8. \nCurrently, the Government operates over 1,600 bank accounts at MMA. These accounts \nare  not  adequately  controlled.  Although  the  existing  budget  system  does  record  cash \ndisbursements  made  against  the  allocated  budget  for  a  particular  item,  it  does  not  record  the \ncommitments made against those funds at the time of ordering and registered commitments or \nnot.  \n\n \n\nThe  establishment  of  the  treasury  division  under  the  Project  will  become  an  effective \n9. \nmeans by which government can save substantial amounts of public money. The existing audit \nsystem lacks the resources and access to timely information.  Figures provided by the Maldives \nAudit  Office  indicate  an  annual  average  loss  of  Rf2  million  due  to  lack  of  proper  internal \ncontrols.  These  losses  have  occurred  through  fraud  and  inefficiency.  Availability  of  timely \ninformation will be enhanced in the new system and a more effective internal and external audit \nfunction  would  be  carried  out,  which  will  be  likely  to  act  as  a  deterrent  for  parties  engaging  in \nmisappropriation and embezzlement of public funds. \n  \n10. \nAnother  major  reporting  deficiency  of  the  existing  PAS  is  the  inability  of  the  system  to \nproduce  a  set  of  audited  financial  statements  of  the  Government.    At  the  end  of  each  year,  a \nconsolidated  statement  of  actual  expenditure  against  budgeted  expenditure  is  prepared,  but \ndoes  not  conform  to  international  accounting  standards,  nor  does  the  auditor  general  express \nan opinion on these financial statements of the Government. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  specifically  address  these  particular  issues,  and  the  proposed  system \nshould  be  able  to  generate  annual  reports  such  as  statements  of:  (i)  assets  and  liabilities; \n(ii) consolidated  revenue  fund;  (iii)  general  loan  fund  and  capital  works;  (iv)  trust  fund; \n(v) revolving fund; (vi) contingency fund; and (vii) other customized reports.  \n \nSuch  reports,  if  prepared  and  independently  audited  will  facilitate  the  process  of  The \n12. \nMaldives obtaining a country credit rating, which is not currently available. Reports indicate that \nin  2001,  the  government  paid  over  Rf49  million  in  interest  on  foreign  loans.  Successful \nimplementation  of  this  Project  will  enable  generation  of  such  financial  statements,  which  will \nlead  to  improved  credit  ratings  that  will  help  the  country  to  borrow  funds  in  the  international \nmarkets at much more favorable terms. Though this benefit could be substantial in the long run, \nwe have not quantified the savings in the benefit-cost analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nEconomic Costs of the Project \n\nC. \n \nThe  new  structure  to  be  established  under  this  Project  will  comprise  an  internal  audit \n13. \nbureau,  an  accounting  office,  and  modifications  to  the  existing  treasury  functions.  Based  on \nexamples  in  other  countries  of  similar  size  and  similar  systems,  an  estimated  additional \n15 employees will be required to fill the posts that will be created under the new PAS and will \nincur an additional annual average cost of Rf0.99 million of salaries when the proposed system \nis  fully  established.  In  addition,  the  Project  is  expected  to  incur  annual  maintenance  costs, \nabove Rf1 million per annum, and costs of staff retraining of approximately Rf1.62 million over 2 \nyears. The Project includes a large component of training. The extensive training should reduce \nthe extent of record keeping and data entry errors.          \n \nD. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was not computed since the \n14. \nmajority  of  the  benefits  that  will  accrue  from  the  Project  are  not  quantifiable.  Instead  of  the \nEIRR, a matrix of the benefits and costs is given to highlight the costs and benefits that can be \nassociated with the Project. \n \n \n\nBenefit\u2013Cost Analysis \n\n \n\nConsultancy, software and hardware \n\nCosts \n\nAdditional staff requirements \n\n\u2022  Consultants will be engaged in training staff, \nimplementing the proposed accounting \nsystem, and drafting and translating  \nlegislation  \n\n\u2022  Software and hardware is necessary to set \n\nup the new system \n\nAdditional staff required for the proposed \nstructure of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n(MOFT):  (i) the treasury division, (ii) the internal \naudit bureau \n\nSystem Maintenance \n\nSystem needs periodic maintenance and \nupgrading \n\nEconomic cost of retraining employees \n\nTraining will be provided to current and new staff \nfor efficient and effective operation  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\n \nGood governance and accountability \n \n \nExternal reports to meet internationally \naccepted accounting standards \n \n \n \nImproved transparency \n\nBenefits \n\nBenefits can be quite substantial but difficult to \nquantify. \n\nPreparation of independently audited government \nfinancial statements will lead to improvements in \ninternational credit rating and will help the country to \nborrow funds in the international market at more \nfavorable terms in the long run. \n\nThe legislative amendments currently being drafted  \nwill enhance transparency and accountability in the \nmanagement of public finances. \n\nThe availability of meaningful and timely \ninformation \n\n \n\nProvide decision makers with more reliable, accurate, \nand timely information, resulting in more timely and \nbetter quality decisions. \n\nSignificant reductions in cash holdings in atolls  This will help increase the cash pool available for \n\ninvestment (physical and/or financial). \n\nBetter financial returns on public funds through \nimprovements in fiscal discipline and cash \nmanagement \n\nSavings on interest payments to the Maldives \nMonetary Authority (MMA) \n\nSavings will be obtained through investment of idle \ncash that is existing in the current system. \n\nReplacing the existing Government 1,600 bank \naccounts at MMA and commercial banks with \na single public bank account \n\nThe existing manual system will be replaced by a \nmuch simpler and more cost-effective mechanism, \nresulting in substantial time savings. \n\nImproved accounting procedures resulting in \nstaff time savings \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImproved Internal controls \n\nIt is envisioned that fraud and overspending will be \nreduced due to the successful implementation of the \nPAS. \n\nOverall Fiscal Impact \n\nThe new PAS will enable and facilitate better and greater fiscal discipline.   \n\nE. \n \n15. \n \n16. \nUnder  the  new  system,  the  existing  1,600  bank  accounts  held  with  MMA  will  be \nconsolidated  into  a  single  public  account  to  enhance  control  over  public  monies.  This \nconsolidation process will bring about a significant saving in the total staff hours required for the \nday-to-day  operations.  The  proposed  financial  planning  division  and  the  cash  management \nsection  of  MOFT  could  then  play  a  more  effective  role  in  the  management  of  government \nfinances  by  creating  savings  through  the  opportunities  that  will  be  created  with  the \nimplementation of the proposed system.   \n \n17. \nThe flow of cash between atoll spending units and Male\u2019 is expected to be significantly \nreduced  under  the  new  system.  As  estimates  indicate  that  up  to  Rf30  million-40  million  are  at \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ntimes  held  in  such  atoll  offices,  more  effective  management  could  in  effect  offset  the  deficit \nfinancing of MOFT by MMA. \n \n18.  MOFT  reports  also  indicate  that  approximately  Rf576  million  of  government  funds  and \ntrust  monies  are  deposited  and  kept  with  MMA  for  significantly  long  durations  without  being \nproperly managed.  The proposed new accounting system will lead to consolidation of all such \nidle funds and pool them to get a better financial return on such deposits. \n \nUtilization  of  such  deposits  in  the  cash  management  process  would  bring  about \n19. \nsignificant  savings  in  net  domestic  interest  payments  by  MOFT.  Currently,  MOFT  incurs  an \naverage interest expense of Rf65 million per annum on loans obtained from MMA. According to \nestimates,  after  providing  for  adequate  liquid  funds  for  day-to-day  operations,  at  least  40%  of \nsuch  idle  funds  could  be  invested.  Assuming  investment  of  only  25%  of  total  idle  funds  at  an \ninterest rate of 6% (MMA lending rate) will generate an average annual return of Rf9.1 million in \ninterest earnings that could be used to offset the deficit financing. \n \nFurthermore lack of a commitment register is one of the biggest weaknesses in budget \n20. \ncontrol  that  have  resulted  in  overspending.  As  a  consequence,  approximately  an  average  of \nRf1.8  million  would  be  incurred  each  year  by  various  government  units  over  and  above  the \nallocated budget.
