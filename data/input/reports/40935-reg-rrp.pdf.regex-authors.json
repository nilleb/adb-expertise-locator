The Leasing Sector in Sri Lanka  9 \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nsecured loans (i) of up to $10 million to Lanka ORIX Leasing Company Limited (LOLC), and (iii) \nof up to $4.5 million to Maldives Finance Leasing Company Pvt. Ltd. (MFLC).  \n \n2.  The  main  reason  for  grouping  both  transactions  into  one  project  is  for  operational \nefficiency. Given the geographical proximity of the two countries and the similarities of the \nunderlying business of each company (i.e., leasing to small and medium enterprises [SMEs]), it \nwas felt that it would be more cost and resource efficient to process the two components in one \nRRP. Each project will, however, be recorded separately in the Private Sector Operations \nDepartment\u2019s systems and balance sheet and will be monitored on an individual basis.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Problems Affecting the Small and Medium Enterprises Sector in Sri Lanka and the \nMaldives \n1.  Sri Lanka \n3.  SMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  the  economy  of  Sri  Lanka  and  are  key  drivers  of \nemployment, economic growth, and development. However, more than 80% of the SMEs in Sri \nLanka have difficulty accessing financial services and securing financing. That is mainly due to \n(i) a strong risk aversion among the banks in the country with respect to SME lending; and (ii) \nthe absence of a diversified financial sector capable of serving SMEs, which is due in part to \nweaknesses in the judicial system as it applies to registering and enforcing security interests.1 \n \n4.  The results of a recent survey carried out by ADB and the World Bank2 indicate that the \ncost of finance impedes urban and rural firms alike, with almost a third of urban firms and rural \nbusinesses citing it as a major constraint. Small, urban manufacturing firms pay significantly \nhigher average interest rates (18%) than do large ones (12%). They also pay higher rates than \ndo rural enterprises (14.5%), which benefit from subsidies from some state financial institutions \nand  microfinance  institutions.  (These  subsidies,  however,  threaten  the  viability  of  these \ninstitutions.) With support from international funding agencies, commercial banks have started \nto enter the market for SME finance, although their lending remains concentrated in Colombo. \nBecause  of  these  distortions,  interest  rates  in  rural  areas  vary  widely.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka\u2019s high and persistent budget deficits add to the cost of finance, as the \nGovernment crowds out the private sector to meet its borrowing requirements.  \n \n5.  Rural enterprises avail themselves of external finance but have extremely limited access \nto formal finance. They obtain most of their financing for new investments from internal sources \n(43%)  and  family  and  friends  (35%).  Public  financial  institutions,  despite  their  widespread \npresence in rural areas, account for a far smaller share of rural investment finance. Private \ncommercial banks provide a minimal share (2%), and mostly to larger enterprises. For firms with \ninadequate external finance, the consequence is limited opportunities for growth. Collateral in \nthe form of land is especially important for rural enterprises. For many rural entrepreneurs, \nhowever,  high  levels  of  public  landownership,  unclear  ownership  records,  and  widespread \n                                                      \n1  ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n2  ADB and World Bank. 2004. Investment Climate Assessment. Washington D.C. ", "2     \nrestrictions on the use and transfer of land make it difficult to use land as collateral, thus limiting \naccess to external finance. \n \n2.  The Maldives \n6.  A recent survey carried out by the World Bank3 showed that most of the 2,500 registered \nSMEs in the Maldives are quite small, with an average turnover of less than $80,000 per \nannum. Their activities were generally limited to a very few economic sectors: tourism, fisheries, \nmanufacturing, transport, and related services. Most of them are located in the capital, Male, \nwhich accounts for 27% of the total population. \n \n7.  Among the major obstacles mentioned, more than 65% of all respondents identified a \nlack of access to finance as the most important and most severe constraint affecting enterprise \nperformance. The financial sector is shallow and the banks in the Maldives have been following \na very conservative approach that has a high exposure to the tourism sector. The commercial \nbanks are still focused on collateral rather than on cash-based lending, and there are no venture \ncapital companies in the country to support emerging entrepreneurs in the various SME sectors. \nMoreover, there is no credit information system or bureau that would facilitate lending, and \nespecially to new borrowers. \n \nB.  The Financial Sector in Sri Lanka and the Maldives \n8.  As of the end 2005,4 the Sri Lankan financial sector had 22 licensed commercial banks \n(11 domestic private banks and 11 foreign), 2 state banks, 26 registered finance companies, \nand 14 licensed specialized banks (2 development finance institutions, 1 national savings bank, \n3  housing  finance  institutions,  2  private  savings  and  development  banks,  and  6  regional \ndevelopment banks).  \n \n9.  The two state-owned banks still play an important role in the domestic banking sector \nand hold almost 42% of total banking assets. Their market share has dropped significantly in the \nlast 5 years, however, while the share of the private banks in total assets grew from 34.5% in \n1998 to 43.0% as of the end of 2005.5 The state banks have nationwide branch networks, but \nremain highly inefficient and undercapitalized. The state-owned banks\u2019 ratios for nonperforming \nloans declined from 18% in 2003 to 8% in June 2006, thereby reaching levels similar to those of \ndomestic private banks. Capital adequacy ratios have also improved (to 8% of total assets), and \nsteps have been taken to further enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework, including \nplans to adopt the Basel II capital accord by 2008. \n \n10.  The major private commercial banks have widened their networks to cover almost the \nentire  country.  The  four  leading  private  commercial  banks\u2014Hatton  National  Bank  (HNB), \nCommercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC), Seylon Bank, and Sampath Bank\u2014have over 200 branches \namong them nationwide. They continue to dominate the private banking sector, accounting for \n85% of its assets, 90% of the deposits, and 85% of the loans granted. CBC and Sampath Bank \nare seeking greater prudential safety and security through diversification, as their loan portfolios \nwere traditionally concentrated in financing large enterprises. HNB has been an innovator in \nSME lending in Sri Lanka and one of the earliest financial institutions to recognize that lending \nto SMEs can be profitable and provide a cushion to the bank in times of economic decline. \n                                                      \n3  World Bank. 2006. The Maldives: Sustaining Growth and Improving the Investment Climate. Washington, DC. \n4  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2005. Annual Report 2005.  Colombo. \n5  IMF. 2006. Financial Sector Quarterly Update. Washington, DC. ", "  3\n \n11.  Commercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number \nof the commercial banks to lend more aggressively to SMEs. Banks such as Sampath, HNB, \nand CBC play leading roles in this regard. Although encouraging, these resource mobilization \nactivities will first and foremost fund activities bearing relatively lower risks for the banks, such \nas housing and car loans, and only then be available for SME lending. Their volumes are \nlimited,  given  the  relatively  high  short-term  interest  rates.  Additionally,  there  remains  the \nproblem of high unit transaction costs in processing relatively small SME loans. \n \n12.  The financial sector in the Maldives is very narrow and is dominated by the banking \nsector. Nonbank financial institutions in the country consist of only a few companies. The \ndominant player in the banking sector is the state-owned Bank of the Maldives, the country\u2019s \nonly indigenous bank, with 17 branches located in the capital and some of the distant atolls \nservicing the island communities. The other banks in the country are branches of the State Bank \nof India, Bank of Ceylon, Habib Bank, and HSBC, all of which have single locations in the \ncapital Male. Competition among banks is intense given the rate of growth in the economy.6 \nLending tends to be short to medium term and fixed-rate funding is scarce. \n \n13.  All financial institutions are under the supervision of the Maldives Monetary Authority \n(MMA) which promulgated and issued the Regulations for Finance Leasing Companies and \nFinance Leasing Transactions in 2001.  \n \nC.  The Leasing Sector in Asia \n14.  In most developing countries, capital markets are relatively undeveloped and banks are \noften unable or unwilling to undertake term lending. Banks prefer to lend to larger, established \nbusinesses  with  well-developed  balance  sheets  and  credit  histories.  Operations  in \nmicroenterprises and small businesses are oriented to cash flow but rarely have organized \nhistorical  financial  records  or  the  assets  needed  for  collateral  to obtain  conventional  bank \nfinancing.7 In developing countries generally, therefore, but particularly in Asia, SMEs often \nhave unmet needs for lease financing. \n \n15.  The  leasing  industry  in  Asia  makes  an  important  contribution  to  the  economic \ndevelopment of the region by providing a financing tool to both large enterprises and SMEs. In \ndoing  so,  it  increases  the  level  of  private  investment  in  capital  equipment.  The  essential \nproposition underlying the concept of leasing is that a business enterprise earns its profits from \nthe use of assets rather than through ownership of those assets. In developing countries with \nunclear  property  rights,  poorly  functioning  asset  registries,  and  weak  laws  for  securing \ntransactions, leasing can provide an attractive alternative to both lessees without collateral and \nlessors wanting to improve the possibility of repossession, if necessary. \n \n                                                      \n6  The Maldives economy has been growing at an annual average of 7.5% for the past decade. Although growth \nsuffered in 2005 and was actually negative due to the adverse affects of the tsunami, it is expected to bounce back \nand for GDP to grow at a double-digit rate. GDP in 2005 was $669.5 million, or approximately $1,860 per capita. \nTourism is the main industry, contributing over 33% of GDP. Fisheries, marine transportation, and trade follow close \nbehind. Interest rates have been virtually constant in the range of 7.75%\u201313.00% since 2003. Previously, they had \nbeen as high as 12%\u201315%. The country has a managed exchange rate regime with the local currency, the rufiyaa, \ncurrently pegged to the US dollar at a rate of  Rf12.75 = $1. The rufiyaa is freely exchangeable.   \n7 World Bank.  Leasing to Support Small Businesses and Micro Enterprises. Policy Research Working Paper. \nWashington, DC (WPS 1857). \n ", "4     \n16.  ADB,  by  supporting  policy  reforms  and  contributing  private  sector  investment,  has \nplayed a critical role in launching the leasing industries in a number of Asian countries, including \nBangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. However, the leasing industries in \nmost of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) remain underdeveloped. A recent study \ncommissioned by ADB8 on the leasing industry in 13 DMCs indicates that the total annual \nleasing volume in these countries is less than $7 billion in a global leasing industry of over $500 \nbillion. Leasing has an average penetration of 0.4% of GDP9 in those countries while that figure \nexceeds 1% in developed countries. \n \nFigure 1 \nAnnual Leasing Volume by Selected Developing Member Countries (2003) \n \n2.5 Total Selected DMCs: $6.4 billion \n \nUS: $208 billion \n2 Japan: $69 billion \nUK:$19billion\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nC hinaI ndonesia India Sri Lanka Pakistan M alaysiKaazakhstaBnangladeshPhilippinesU zbekistan Tajikistan\nVolume ($ Bn) Volume/GDP (%)\n \n                Source: World Leasing Yearbook 2005. \n \nD.  The Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka and the Maldives \n1.  Sri Lanka \n17.  It can be noted from the figure above that Sri Lanka has a leasing penetration of \napproximately 2.4% of GDP, which is significantly larger than that of any of the other DMCs \nunder observation. It is even greater than the average leasing penetration in the US or Japan. \nThe main reason for the higher use of leasing as a financing tool in Sri Lanka as compared with \nother DMCs in the region lies in the fact that the leasing sector in that country developed much \nearlier. The major growth in leasing occurred following the formation of the first two specialized \nleasing companies, namely, Lanka ORIX Leasing Company Limited and Mercantile Lloyds \nLeasing, in the early 1980s. These companies focused their leasing activities primarily on \nproviding leasing facilities to SMEs\u2014a segment that traditionally was neglected by the banking \n                                                      \n8  ADB. 2005.

", "  5\nindustry  in  many  DMCs.  Furthermore,  leasing\u2019s  strong  market  share  in  Sri  Lanka  can  be \nexplained by the weakness of traditional financing for the SME sector. That, in turn, is due to the \nweakness  of  certain  legal  provisions  for  registering  and  enforcing  security  interests  (e.g., \ninefficiencies in the registries for land and movable properties).10  \n \n18.  Sixty-eight companies were registered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as providing \nleasing as of the end of 2005. However, only 20 of these were registered exclusively to provide \nleasing.  Leasing  is  also  offered  by  commercial  banks,  specialized  banks,  and  finance \ncompanies.  \n \n19.  Leases in Sri Lanka are predominantly financial leases because the Leasing Act in \nexistence  applies  to  financial  leases  and  not  operating  leases.11  Passenger  cars  and \ncommercial vehicles are the main categories absorbing the bulk of financial leases although \ntrade and transportation also enjoy continued growth among the various leasing subsectors. For \nfurther information on the leasing sector in Sri Lanka, see Appendix 1. \n \n20.  In LOLC\u2019s case, for example, 41% of its borrowers are in the trading business, followed \nby 15% in the service sector, and 14% in the industrial sector. \n \n2.  The Maldives \n21.  From a base of zero in May 2002, the Maldives leasing industry had grown to a $15 \nmillion portfolio of financial leases by mid-2006. That represented approximately 1.5% of GDP. \nSmall  leases  are  normally  under  $50,000  while  a  medium-sized  lease  would  be  under \n$200,000.12 The majority of the leases executed are for acquiring productive assets. A small \nproportion of the transactions are of the sale-and-lease-back type. Consumer financing in the \nform of leasing occurs informally in the economy, and in particular for motorcycles.  \n \n22.  The general regulatory climate is very conducive to the industry. The MMA actively \nsupports leasing as a tool to broaden the base of the economy and to empower the SME sector \nfor participating in the country\u2019s economic growth. The leasing regulations in place are very \ncomprehensive without being too restrictive. They have not yet been well tested, however, in \nsuch areas as recovery, repossession, and legal proceedings.  \n \n23.  Lessors require a specific license from the MMA to commence leasing operations in the \nMaldives, and they are subject to the MMA\u2019s regulatory supervision and the provisions of the \nexisting leasing regulations. \n \nIII.  PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS \nA.  Justification for ADB\u2019s Participation \n1.  Primary Objective \na.  Strengthen Leasing Industry \n24.  The proposed ADB assistance is expected to strengthen the leasing industry further and \nexpand the funding resources and financial services available to the SME sector in the two \n                                                      \n10  ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n11 Daily News. 2005. Leasing Industry Poised for Growth. \n12 Maldives Monetary Authority. Available: http://www.mma.gov.mv. \n ", "6     \ncountries. The activity of leasing companies in Sri Lanka and the Maldives is constrained by the \nneed to borrow at short maturity to fund a business that lends at a longer maturity. The \nunderdeveloped nature of corporate debt markets in both countries has made nonbank leasing \nfirms heavily dependent on commercial banks for their funding through short-term borrowings \nand commercial paper. This has resulted in maturity mismatches in assets and liabilities and \nhigher costs of funds for these institutions. \n \nb.  Promote SME growth \n25.  The proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will provide them access to long-\nterm  funds and  thereby  enable  them  to  promote  alternative  financing  instruments  to  SME \nentrepreneurs, promote their operations and profitability, and enhance their competitiveness. \n \n26.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategies for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It will \npromote private sector participation in SME development. The demonstration effects related to \nlong-term funding will be positive. \n \n27.  The project is also complementary to ADB\u2019s public sector approach as exemplified by \nADB\u2019s recent financial markets loan.13 This program is intended to facilitate participation of the \nprivate sector, including SMEs, in the Sri Lankan economy by supporting government reforms to \neliminate impediments to and develop opportunities for their involvement.  \n \nc.  Improve Broader Capital Markets Development \n28.  Leasing  companies  can  also  boost  capital  markets  development.  Once  they  have \nestablished operating histories, they can tap and foster equity markets. Their demand for term \ndebt  broadens  the  term  lending  options  for  banks,  finance  houses,  pension  funds,  and \ninsurance companies. They can also issue bonds or other marketable instruments. Finally, \nleasing companies can securitize their lease receivables, taking some assets off balance sheet \nto achieve a higher leverage and better returns while adding another tradable instrument to local \ncapital markets. ADB is currently in discussions with LOLC regarding a possible securitization of \npart of its lease portfolio whereby ADB would provide a guarantee to credit enhance the issue \nand/or purchase the mezzanine tranche of such a structured transaction. This would represent \nthe first true securitization deal in the capital markets of Sri Lanka. This would also represent a \nstrong example of cooperation between the public sector and private sector departments within \nADB, where ADB\u2019s public sector window would provide a loan to focus on introducing publicly \ntraded securitized bonds in the capital market14 and the Private Sector Operations Department \nwould test the regulatory framework by structuring the first such transaction. \n \n2.  Development Impact \n29.  From a development perspective, a well-functioning leasing industry is an important \nfinancing tool for SMEs. Such enterprises are particularly constrained by the lack of assets that \ncan be used as collateral for bank loans. When credit is available from informal sources, it tends \nto be short-term and too costly for investment financing. Advantages of leasing over alternative \nforms  of  finance  for  SMEs  include  a  lower  down  payment,  credit  availability,  simpler \ndocumentation and security arrangements, faster credit approval, and tax incentives. In fact, \n                                                      \n13 ADB. 2004. Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. Manila (R265-04). \n14 A securitization bill will be introduced to Parliament whereby special purpose vehicles may be established as \nseparate legal entities to pool real or intangible assets against which public securities may be issued. This \nsecuritization bill is one of the components of ADB\u2019s Financial Markets Program. ", "  7\nleasing and supplier credit15 are often the only sources of credit available to SMEs. In promoting \nthe  small  enterprise  in  developing  countries,  leasing  plays  a  role  in  reducing  poverty  by \ngenerating income and employment.  \n \n30.  It is expected that about 200 SMEs will be assisted through lease financing. That would \nresult in additional capital formation, value added, employment, foreign exchange earnings and \nsavings, as well as promotion of new entrepreneurs. This is fully in line with the focus of the \ngovernments of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, which have given priority to the development of \nenterprises by new entrepreneurs and of the SME sector in general.  \n \n31.  Moreover, a robust leasing industry has the potential to contribute to the development of \ncapital markets by introducing SMEs to formal financial markets and providing demand from \nleasing companies for capital markets funding. \n \n3.  Measures for Development Impact \n32.  ADB will measure the expected development impact of the proposed loans. These \nperformance  measures  follow  the  Multilateral  Development  Banks\u2014Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup\u2019s Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  project  itself,  (ii) \neconomic sustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Examples of development impact \nmeasures are (i) business performance (overall profitability and commercial viability of the \nfinancial  institution):  return  on  equity,  net  interest  margin,  growth  in  assets;  (ii)  economic \nsustainability  (allocation  of  resources  and  provision  of  financial  services  to  viable  private \nenterprises): increase of lending to small business enterprises, disbursements to rural areas, \ncredit quality in lending; (iii) private sector development (contribution to the growth of viable \nfinancial  sector  and  financial  markets  development):  operational  improvement  (e.g.,  credit \nappraisal methods), evidence of spillover effects (e.g., competitors adopting best practices of \nbank), contribution to financial strength of sector (e.g., better match of assets and liabilities). \nPlease refer to Appendix 2 for the full development impact framework. \n \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n33.  Environment. This financing is classified as category FI. All borrowers will be required \nto adopt appropriate environmental management systems in accordance with ADB guidelines.  \n \n34.  Social  Safeguards.  This  financing  is  classified  as  category  C.  No  involuntary \nresettlement or any impact on indigenous peoples is expected as a result of this financing. All \nsub-borrowers are extremely small and serve individuals and SMEs. Their clients are in the \nprivate sector and do not have the power to trigger involuntary resettlement. ADB\u2019s policies for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will be explained to the participating firms.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy;  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n35.  The two companies have been advised of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require LOLC and MFLC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \n                                                      \n15 Supplier credit is basically a period of delay allowed by a firm's supplier to pay its invoices. Frequently, the terms \nare 2% discount on invoices if paid in 10 days or net if paid in 30 days. \n ", "8     \nprocedures and controls following international best practice standards for preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and each company will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  A framework agreement confirming ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments, lending operations, and guarantee operations in the private sector is in \neffect between the governments of Sri Lanka and the Maldives and ADB. ADB will obtain \nconfirmation by the governments of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, respectively, that they have no \nobjection to the financing by ADB prior to any funding being made available. \n \n37.

Background \n \n1.  From the late 1970s, finance companies in Sri Lanka offered some leasing within their \nrange of financial products, but the major growth in finance leasing occurred following the \nformation of two International Finance Corporation-sponsored specialized leasing companies. \nThese were Lanka Orient Leasing Company (LOLC), in 1980, and Mercantile loyds bank only \none Leasing, in 1983. At the end of 1985, these two leasing companies accounted for 77% of \nlease  transactions.1  The  companies  were  provided  tax  holidays  for  5  years  from  their \nformations. Generous capital allowance. Vehicles 4 years, 3 years for equipment. Vehicles for \nyear 6 years  \n \n2.  Until 2001, leasing companies were largely unregulated and mainly specialist by nature. \nIn 2001, a new leasing act was introduced permitting new leasing companies to be established \nas long as they met a minimum capital requirement of SLRs75 million ($0.75 million). This \nprompted a number of leasing companies to enter the industry. \n \nB.  Portfolio Concentration \n \n3.  The Sri Lankan leasing sector has played an important role in developing the transport \nsector, especially in rural areas. Passenger and commercial vehicles are the main category of \nassets financed by leasing, with a 70% share of the total portfolio in 2004 (down from 77% in \n2003). Over 75% of leasing companies in Sri Lanka still concentrate on vehicle leasing and only \na few have diversified into such other products as the financing of warehouses, hospitals, \neducational institutions, and office equipment. Over 50% of leases were utilized to purchase \nsecondhand vehicles2  \n \n4.  The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is calling for the leasing industry to diversify into other \nareas and to target SME financing.3 The leasing of non-vehicle equipment has been hampered \nby the absence of a clear legal process with regard to the repossession of equipment and the \nshort commercial life of so much modern equipment (unlike vehicles, which have a ready \nsecondhand value). In a recent interview,4 the CEO of People\u2019s Leasing Company, the second \nlargest leasing company in Sri Lanka, Mr. Kumarage, pointed out that it is typical, with the \nexception  of  a  small  number  of  developed  markets,  for  vehicles  to  dominate  the  leasing \nindustry. He points out that factories often have less need for leasing in Sri Lanka as they \nreceive  favorable  credit  lines  from  development  finance  institutions.  However,  he  also \nhighlighted machinery required for the tea industry as a potential avenue for development.  \n \nC.  Entry of Banks \n \n5.  Most of the recent entrants into the Sri Lankan leasing industry are subsidiaries of banks \nrather than specialist leasing companies. There is some resentment among specialist leasing \ncompanies  toward  these  banking  entrants,  who  are  regarded  as  \u201cfair-weather\u201d  lenders. \n                                                      \n1  ADB. 1987.

People\u2019s  Leasing \nCompany, a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, is now the largest leasing business by volume. In its 7 \nyears of operation the company has raised SLRs2.4 billion ($24 million) through securitization. \n \nD.  Legal Recourse and Repossession Laws \n \n6.  In Sri Lanka, litigation to recover bad debts is a protracted and costly process. An \narbitration procedure designed to improve this process is not proving as successful as had been \nhoped, with procedures often proving even more unwieldy and expensive.5 Leasing companies \nare excluded from Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt Recovery Act, which enables other financial institutions to \nrepossess and sell collateral without court intervention. Weaknesses in the guarantee and \nrepossession  laws  hamper  growth  of  the  leasing  sector,  especially  outside  the  better \nunderstood urban automotive sector. \n \nE.  Regulation and Tax Considerations \n \n7.  Under the 2001 leasing act, all leasing companies were required to be regulated by the \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka6. \n \n8.  In recent years there have been a number of significant changes in the fiscal treatment \nof leasing. In 2002, a value-added tax (VAT) regime was introduced and the leasing sector was \nsubjected to input and output rates. The input and output taxes have been aligned at 15%. It \nhas been argued that these changes have had the effect of making leases less competitive.7 \n \n9.  The state is now contemplating a number of changes in legislation that might hamper the \nindustry. First, the state is considering to reduce depreciation allowances from 25% to 12.5%. \nSecond, the Government is proposing to charge leasing companies the higher of 1% of turnover \nor SLRs50 million ($0.5 million).  LOLC argues that \u201cincreases in the VAT rate on leasing, \nspecial  VAT  rates  on  leasing  companies,  economic  service  charges  and  changes  to \ndepreciation  rates  on  vehicles  and  machinery  are  likely  to  make  leasing  an  unattractive \nfinancing option to our core customer base of small and medium-sized business enterprises. \nFurthermore, these fiscal disincentives could effectively undermine the collective efforts of the \nleasing companies to serve the small and medium entrepreneurs who are expected to make a \nsubstantial contribution to the national economy.\u201d \n \n10.  The Sri Lankan leasing industry would benefit from improvements in the process of \nasset recovery, greater self-regulation, and the removal of VAT charges on leasing. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n5  Leasing Industry in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Developing Member Countries, Michael Fox, Manila, 2005. \n6  ADB (2005), Financial Assessment Report for Sri Lanka.
