THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nemergency assistance loan (EAL) to the Republic of the Philippines for the second additional \nfinancing of the Social Protection Support Project (SPSP-AF II).1 \n \n2.  The proposed SPSP-AF II will support the government\u2019s efforts to provide unconditional \nemergency cash assistance (ECA) to the poor and vulnerable households which have been \nadversely  affected  by  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  and  the  associated \ndeclaration of community quarantine announced in several parts of the Philippines since 15 March \n2020. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, or Republic Act No. 11469 (Bayanihan Law),2 which \nwas signed into law on 24 March 2020, empowers the government to provide an ECA of \u20b15,000\u2013\n\u20b18,000 per month for 2 months to around 18 million low-income households / families nationwide.3 \nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the local government units \nhave been designated as the key agencies through which the ECA will be delivered. The SPSP-\nAF II will build on the decade-long support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the \ngovernment\u2019s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), which provides conditional cash \ntransfers  (CCTs)  to  improve  the  health  and  education  of  nearly  4.28  million  households \nnationwide. This proposed EAL will fund part of the ECA to these 4Ps households so that they \ncan cope with the unfolding economic, health, and social costs of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n3.  4Ps: Design and conditionalities. The 4Ps was launched by the government in 2008 to \ntarget poor households and help them improve the education and health of their children, as a \npathway out of poverty.4 The CCTs are as follows: (i) for the education grant, for 10 months each \nyear, the 4Ps households receive \u20b1300 per month for children in elementary or secondary school, \n\u20b1500 per month for children in grades 7\u201310, and \u20b1700 per month for children in grades 11\u201312, \nprovided the children attend at least 85% of classes each month;5 and (ii) for the health grant, the \n4Ps households receive a fixed amount of \u20b1750 per month for 12 months (irrespective of the \nnumber of children), provided they fulfill the following conditions: (a) pregnant women avail \nthemselves of pre- and post-natal care, and are attended during childbirth by trained health \nprofessionals; (b) parents attend regular family development sessions; (c) children aged 5 years \nand under receive regular preventive health check-ups and vaccination; and (d) children aged 6\u2013\n14 years receive deworming pills biannually. Households exit from the 4Ps either when all the \nchildren enrolled for education grants reach 18 years of age and/or graduate out of senior high \nschool,6 or if they fail to comply with the conditions despite repeated reminders. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s past engagement. On 2 September 2010, ADB approved the Social Protection \nSupport Project (footnote 1) for $400 million to support the government\u2019s social protection \nprogram through CCTs under the 4Ps. On 9 February 2016, ADB approved the first additional \n \n1  ADB. 2010. Philippines: Social Protection Project. Manila. The original loan became effective on 12 January 2011 \nand closed financially after full disbursement on 5 June 2017; ADB. 2016. Philippines: Social Protection Support \nProject (Additional Financing). Manila. \n2  Accessible at https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2020/03mar/20200324-RA-11469-RRD.pdf  \n3  The Bayanihan Law will remain in effect only for 3 months unless extended by the Congress of the Philippines.  \n4  Initially, only those households below the poverty line with children younger than 14 years old and/or pregnant \nwomen, as identified by the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction in 2009 (Listahanan 1), \nwere included under the 4Ps. With the launch of the kindergarten to grade 12 Program (which extended school from \ngrade 10 to grade 12) by the Department of Education in 2015, the 4Ps raised the age cap of children from 14 to 18 \nyears to enable them to complete senior high school. \n5  Each 4Ps household can register up to three eligible children for the education grant. \n6  Based on the operations manual of the 4Ps, if the child beneficiary turns 19 during the school year, he or she shall \ncontinue to receive education grants until the end of that school year.  \n   ", "2   \nfinancing of SPSP (SPSP-AF or the ongoing project) (footnote 1) for $400 million to support \nexpansion of the 4Ps. The DSWD served as the executing agency for the SPSP, the SPSP-AF, \nand the associated technical assistance grants. \n \n5.  Good performance of SPSP-AF. The SPSP-AF\u2019s outcome is increased household \nconsumption and increased utilization of education and health services by 4Ps families, especially \nmothers and children. The outputs are (i) national targeting system to select poor families \nimplemented efficiently, (ii) conditional health and education cash grants provided to poor families, \n(iii) capacity for CCT program operations strengthened, and (iv) systems for monitoring and \nevaluating social protection programs improved. The SPSP-AF is performing well, with project \nperformance rated on track annually since loan effectiveness in 2016. By 8 January 2020, the \nentire additional financing of $400 million had been disbursed. The project has no technical issues \nand has satisfactorily achieved most of its expected results. School attendance of 4Ps children \n(aged 3\u201318 years) was 95.8% as compared to the target of 90.0%. About 83.7% of pregnant \nwomen delivered their babies in health facilities, exceeding the target of 70.0%. Nearly 85.21% \nof births were delivered by skilled health personnel.7 The project has consistently complied with \nsafeguards and financial covenants. The SPSP-AF was scheduled to close on 30 June 2020. \nHowever, the government, in its letter dated 28 March 2020 to the ADB President, requested for \na second additional financing to be processed on a fast-track basis to support the DSWD in \nproviding the ECA to 4Ps households nationwide. The SPSP-AF II meets all of the eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing including (i) satisfactory implementation progress, (ii) satisfactory \ncompliance with safeguard policy requirements, (iii) successful management of risks, and (iv) a \nrating of highly satisfactory or satisfactory in the project performance ratings. \n \n6.  The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global emergency. While there has not \nbeen any destruction of physical infrastructure as is normally experienced during natural hazards \nor non-natural disasters, the economic, health, and social disruption caused by the pandemic is \nunparalleled (paras. 7\u20138). By providing immediate, short-term transitional assistance in the form \nof an ECA, the EAL will support the DSWD in addressing the urgent basic needs of the poor 4Ps \nhouseholds whose livelihoods have been disrupted. ADB is coordinating with other development \npartners including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia, \nthe International Labour Organization, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Bank, and \nthe World Food Programme.8  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n7.  Adverse impact of COVID-19 outbreak. As in many other countries around the world, \nthe Philippines\u2014and particularly its poor and vulnerable people\u2014has been hit hard by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.9 It poses a very high health risk for the elderly and for those with underlying \nhealth problems. As of 18 April 2020, the Philippines had recorded 6,087 COVID-19 cases, with \n397 deaths. The government declared community quarantine covering the National Capital \nRegion (NCR) on 15 March 2020. This was extended to the entire island of Luzon on 17 March \n \n7  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  For details refer to Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-2019 outbreak a public health emergency of international \nconcern in 30 January 2020. On 12 March 2020, the WHO declared it to be a global pandemic. \n ", "  3 \n2020. This quarantine has subsequently been extended until 30 April 2020.10 The Office of the \nPresident of the Philippines has declared a state of calamity for the country until 17 September \n2020. As a result of the community quarantine, factories have shut down, malls and restaurants \nclosed, supply chains cut, and public transportation halted. While the Philippine economy grew at \na steady average annual rate of 6.5% during 2012\u20132019, growth is expected to be adversely \naffected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Projections  made  by  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority of the Philippines show that the quarantine could reduce gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth to potentially negative levels in 2020.11 \n \n8.  Potential increase in poverty, hunger, and other vulnerabilities. While the poverty rate \nin the Philippines declined from 25.2% in 2012 to 23.3% in 2015 and to 16.6% in 2018,12 absolute \npoverty and inequality remain high. Nearly 17.6 million people continue to live under the poverty \nline. Approximately 14.2 million live just above the line and are vulnerable to sliding back into \npoverty.13 Due to to the sudden loss of livelihoods due to the quarantine, the poor, indigent elderly \nand informal sector workers and daily wage laborers have lost their livelihoods. They have limited \ncash and are unable to purchase adequate food and other basic necessities. With the loss of \nincome and growing food insecurity, compounded by the health risk and cost of COVID-19, the \nprospects for these poor households are very grim. Unless addressed on an emergency basis, \nthis could roll back the progress made by the Philippines in its fight against poverty. Since the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, the DSWD has identified approximately 6.5 million poor and \nvulnerable households and 2.9 million indigent senior citizens as beneficiaries of the proposed \nECA based on different targeting protocols.14 In addition, it is estimated that there are around 7.7 \nmillion informal sector workers and daily wage earners nationwide.15 The DSWD has issued \nguidelines to implement the Social Amelioration Program mandated by the Bayanihan Law. \n \n9.  Vulnerable  segments  \u2013  4Ps  households.  The  4Ps  program  targets  4.4  million \nbeneficiaries covering eligible poor households with children 0\u201318 or with pregnant women, \nhomeless street families, families in need of special protection, and indigenous peoples. As of 29 \nFebruary 2020, there were 4.28 million active households nationwide under the 4Ps. Around \n85.3% of these households are headed by female grantees. There are 643,414 indigenous people \nhouseholds  (i.e.  15.0%  of  total  active  4Ps  households).  Approximately,  202,000  (4.7%) \nhouseholds have a person with disability. In all, 7.8 million children aged 3-18 years old children \n(51.7% females) are registered under the 4Ps. Given the reach of the 4Ps, providing ECA to these \nhouseholds is a top priority of the government, and will be supported under the proposed loan. \nThere is a distinct risk that some of the gains achieved under the 4Ps CCT interventions over the \nyears may get rolled back if these households are not given ECA to meet their food, medicine, \nand other basic needs during this crisis.   \n \n10.  Choice of modality. Building on ADB\u2019s ongoing 4Ps support through additional financing \nwill be faster and more effective in reinforcing the government\u2019s emergency COVID-19 response \n \n10  Local governments in Visayas and Mindanao have followed suit and imposed \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d \nmeasures, including in regional economic hubs and tourism sites (e.g., Cebu, Iloilo, Bohol, Boracay, Leyte, Davao, \nCagayan de Oro, and Bukidnon), which will further impact poor and vulnerable people in these island groups. \n11  National Economic Development Authority. 2020.

Manila. \n14  For details on the targeting protocols and operational guidelines, refer to the Social Amelioration Program \nGuidelines (as of 13 April 2020) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  The estimate is approximately 60% of total informal workers and daily wage earners who are most likely not \nreceiving any benefits from social assistance programs. \n ", "4   \nas compared to designing a new loan. The proposed SPSP-AF II meets all eligibility criteria for \nan EAL (para. 11).16 It will be limited only to the transition phase of the government\u2019s COVID-19 \nresponse,  and  will  support  the  DSWD  in  providing  immediate  and  short-term  transitional \nassistance to the poor 4Ps households whose livelihoods have been disrupted by the COVID-19 \npandemic and quarantine measures. The loan will have a one year implementation period (i.e., \nfrom April 2020 to April 2021). The SPSP-AF II will use DSWD\u2019s targeting mechanisms and time-\ntested cash delivery systems to provide the ECA to approximately 3.67 million 4Ps households \n(out of the total 4.28 million 4Ps households) that have cash cards issued by the Land Bank of \nthe Philippines (LBP). The DSWD continues to have strong ownership of the ongoing SPSP-AF.  \n \n11.  Emergency assistance loan eligibility. The proposed SPSP-AF II meets all eligibility \nrequirements for an EAL as laid down under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(footnote 18):  \n(i)  the government\u2019s request for assistance has been received (para. 5), \n(ii)  the potential impact on social needs and priorities has been identified in a damage \nand needs assessment,17 \n(iii)  the  COVID-19  pandemic  involves  significant  economic  dislocation  and  the \nproposed EAL is intended to address immediate needs, \n(iv)  no security risks to ADB staff are anticipated, and \n(v)  the level of burden and risk sharing among the stakeholders is appropriate. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The proposed SPSP-AF II is aligned with the following impact: income poverty and non-\nincome poverty reduced.18 The outcome of the overall project will remain the same: household \nconsumption and the use of education and health services by 4Ps households (especially mothers \nand children) are increased. The project will support this outcome through the output described \nin para. 13.  \n \n13.  Unconditional ECA for 4Ps households having cash cards delivered on time. The \nSPSP-AF II will fund ECA of between \u20b15,000 and \u20b18,000 ($98.30 - $157.30) per month for 2 \nmonths to 3.67 million 4Ps households who have cash cards.19 The specific amount of the ECA \nper household will depend on the region and the prevailing minimum wage there. The DSWD will \nrequire nearly $726.1 million to provide ECA to all 4Ps households nationwide for a period of 2 \nmonths. Of this, $637.1 million will be required for the 86% of 4Ps households (i.e., 3.67 million) \nwhich have cash cards. ADB will fund $200 million of this amount.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  ADB  is  supporting  the  government  in  responding  to  the  unprecedented  social  and \neconomic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic through several channels. First, ADB approved \na $3 million grant on 14 March 2020 to help procure critical medical supplies and equipment to \n \n16 ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila (para. 92). \n17  Summary Assessment of Damages and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 National Economic and Development Authority. 2017. Philippine Development Plan 2017\u20132022. The impact \nstatement is unchanged. \n19 The LBP and its conduits, along with the DSWD, organize over-the-counter CCT payments for the 4Ps households \nwho don\u2019t have cash cards. However, because of the quarantine, this arrangement cannot be used. The DSWD is \ndelivering ECA via local government units to these households. Since it will not be possible for ADB to undertake \nfiduciary assessment of the local government units, the second additional financing project will be restricted to the \n86% of 4Ps households (around 3.67 million) with cash cards.  \n ", "  5 \nhelp with COVID-19 treatment.20 Second, ADB approved a $5 million technical assistance project \non 31 March 2020 to support the government by leveraging private sector participation in \nproviding essential food supplies to about 55,000 poor households in the NCR and neighboring \nareas.21 This grant has been provided as \u201cbridge support\u201d until the provision of the ECA through \nSPSP-AF II and other assistance from the government. Third, the proposed Expanded Social \nAssistance Project (ESAP) in the amount of $500 million will continue ADB\u2019s decade-long support \nfor the 4Ps CCT program till 2023.22  \n \n15.  Fourth, ADB is designing an EAL to address the immediate needs of improving COVID-\n19 surveillance, infection prevention, control measures, and diagnostic and treatment capacity. It \nwill also support medium- and long-term investments for future pandemic preparedness. Fifth, the \nproposed COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program ($1.5 billion) will support \ncritical public spending, help finance the government\u2019s COVID-19 response and relief packages, \nand support counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus.23  \n \n16.  ADB has been supporting the DSWD\u2019s social protection programs, which include the 4Ps \nand community-driven development. In collaboration with the DSWD and other development \npartners, ADB has helped to strengthen the national household targeting system, enhancing \ninstitutional capacity, developing credible monitoring and evaluation systems, and generating and \ndisseminating knowledge. Having demonstrated positive results over the years, these programs \nare well-placed to support collective efforts to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on poor \nand vulnerable households. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The overall project is estimated to cost $637.1 million (Table 1). ADB will partly finance \nexpenditures related to providing the ECA to approximately 3.67 million 4Ps households which \nhave cash cards. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The DSWD will continue to serve as the executing agency. It will supervise and coordinate \nimplementation, and ensure the appropriate use of the loan proceeds. The 4Ps National Program \nManagement Office will continue to remain as the implementation unit. A financial management \nassessment has been undertaken as part of the due diligence process. Since the loan will provide \nurgent cash support to alleviate the immediate economic and financial hardships faced by poor \nand vulnerable households, it will have a 1-year implementation period with full disbursement \nexpected. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the project administration manual. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2020\u2013April 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2021  \nEstimated loan closing date  31 October 2021 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Secretary, DSWD (chair) \nRelevant undersecretaries and assistant secretaries (members) \n \n24  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(ii)  Executing agency  DSWD \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program NPMO and RPMO \n(iv)  Implementation unit  NPMO (15 managerial staff) and RPMO (17 managerial staff), supported by \ncontractual staff \nProcurement  Not applicable \nConsulting services  Not applicable \nRetroactive financing   Withdrawals  from  the  loan  account  may  be  made  to  finance  eligible \nexpenditures incurred in connection with the ECA to about 3.67 million 4Ps \nhouseholds that are paid via cash card under the project before the loan \neffectiveness, provided that the expenditures for the ECA have been incurred \nafter the emergeny occurred but not earlier than 12 months before the date \nof the loan agreement and up to 30% of the loan proceeds. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.   \n4Ps = Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, ADB = Asian Development Bank, DSWD = Department of Social Welfare \nand Development, ECA = emergency cash assistance, NPMO = National Program Management Office, RPMO = \nRegional Program Project Management Office. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  A detailed technical review of the DSWD\u2019s targeting protocol, payroll preparation, and \npayments mechanism for making the ECA to 4Ps households with cash cards has been made. \nThe funds will be released through the LBP, using the same cash cards which are used for paying \nCCTs to 4Ps households. This arrangement is quite robust and time tested. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  A standard economic rate of return analysis does not have to be done for this additional \nfinancing.25 Since the proposed SPSP-AF II will utilize the DSWD\u2019s existing targeting protocol and \ncash-card-based delivery system for the 4Ps, the marginal cost for distributing the ECA is \nnegligible. The ECA will help the 4Ps households with cash cards smooth out their consumption \nof food and other basic needs and help to cope with this unprecedented crisis. Since poor \nhouseholds have a higher marginal utility of consumption than the general population, this \nredistribution will be enhance overall welfare. The economic benefits are substantial while the \ncosts are negligible, thus, indicating a high economic rate of return. \n \n23.  Short-term GDP growth is likely to contract substantially because of the quarantine \nmeasures. The project\u2019s contribution is approximately 4.7% of the total cost of emergency \nassistance for 4Ps and non-4Ps beneficiaries (estimated at $4.2 billion) and 31.4% of the \nassistance provided to active 4Ps beneficiaries with cash cards. The national government\u2019s debt \nhad been declining since 2010. While it will be impacted by the crisis, there are adequate fiscal \nresources to absorb increases in government spending for the ECA. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  The Bayanihan Law is a temporary emergency measure (footnote 3) under which the ECA \nwill be urgently provided to 4Ps households to help them meet their food and other basic needs. \n \n25  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nThe government\u2019s 4Ps program has been institutionalized through Republic Act No. 11310 in April \n2019.26 ADB\u2019s proposed ESAP for $500 million will extend support for the CCTs until 2023.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The government continues to strengthen its public financial management. Significant \nimprovements in transparency, policy-based budgeting, and asset\u2013liability management have \nbeen made since the public expenditure and financial accountability assessment of 2007.27 \nHowever, budget reliability, accounting and reporting, and external audit remained weak and are \ncurrently being addressed by the government. At the 4Ps level, the premitigation financial \nmanagement risk is rated substantial. The Commission on Audit conducts annual audit of the \n4Ps. Most observations are resolved within the fiscal year.28 The DSWD has a good financial \nmanagement system with internal controls for its programs. It has extensive experience of \nundertaking large-scale programs and working with multiple development partners. Technical \nassistance  support  is  being  provided  by  ADB  to  further  strengthen  the  DSWD\u2019s  financial \nmanagement system.29 With this support, the risk is moderate. \n \nE.   Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The key  causes  of  poverty  and  vulnerability  include  high  inequality  of  income, \nunderinvestment in human capital, catastrophic health expenditure, and frequent natural hazards. \nThe poverty rate in the Philippines declined from 25.2% in 2012 to 16.6% in 2018. Despite this \ndecline, absolute poverty and the risk of vulnerability remain high, especially with the rapid spread \nof the COVID-19 across the Philippines. The expanded quarantine from mid-March 2020 has \ndeprived not only the poor but also informal sector workers, including daily wage workers of their \nlivelihoods. They are now finding it difficult to pay for food, medicines, and other basic necessities. \nThe project is categorized as  having a gender equity theme as  the COVID-19 crisis may \npotentially  aggravate  inequality  and  disproportionately  impact  poor  people,  especially  poor \nwomen. Of the 4.28 million 4Ps households, 85.3% are headed by female grantees. Key gender \nissues include (i) income loss since many poor women work in informal sectors as daily wage \nearners; (ii) increased negative social behavior including heightened gender-based violence as a \nresult of anxiety and stress around loss of employment, disease transmission, and forced \nconfinement; and (iii) disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women because of their roles as \nprimary household and family caregivers. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n28.  Environment (category C). The project will not support any civil works or other similar \nactivity with potential adverse environmental impacts. \n \n \n26  Accessible at https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/04/17/republic-act-no-11310/. \n27  World  Bank.  2016.

This was converted into a transaction TA facility (with the same name) in November 2018, \nwith additional funding of $1 million to support the design and implementation of the ESAP.  \n30 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "  9 \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not support any civil works or \nother similar activity that involves land acquisition. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The project is categorized B as it will have positive \nimpact on indigenous households by providing them with the ECA to help cope with this crisis. Of \nthe total active 4Ps households, 643,414 (15%) households are those of indigenous people. An \nindigenous people\u2019s plan (IPP) has been prepared following the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \non indigenous peoples safeguards.31 The plan specifies safeguard provisions to be monitored \nduring project implementation to ensure that indigenous peoples can access and receive benefits \nfrom project activities. The SPSP-AF II will ensure that indigenous peoples are aware of the \nadditional support provided by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic. The IPP specifies \nsafeguard provisions to be monitored during project implementation to ensure that indigenous \npeople are not excluded from the list of grantees for additional cash grants and other health \nservices. It provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people are consulted and aware of the \nsupport provided by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic. The IPP specifies that \nindigenous communities will be provided with relevant and adequate information on how to protect \ntheir families from infection. It will ensure culturally appropriate and gender-sensitive consultation \nprocesses are used when engaging tribal leaders, indigenous communities, and indigenous \npeoples representatives. \n \nG.
