The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nPrior  to  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis,  Indonesia  used  infrastructure  development  to \nsupport poverty reduction and economic development.1 However, the financial shock resulted in \ncancellation  or  suspension  of  many  public  and  private  infrastructure  projects.  During  1998\u2013\n2004, the government was burdened with the urgent tasks of financial sector restructuring and \nfiscal consolidation. As a result, infrastructure investments, which accounted for more than 6% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) before 1998, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and fluctuated around \n3% in 2001\u20132006. While investment in infrastructure has started to increase, expenditures have \nnot reached pre-crisis levels. By 2008, infrastructure investment had risen to 3.95% of GDP, but \nwas  still  insufficient  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  growth  aspirations  and  the  growing  demand  from \nexisting infrastructure users, let alone satisfy the large population that is lacking access to basic \ninfrastructure  services.  In  2009,  in  response  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  government \nincluded  a  substantial  infrastructure  component  in  the  fiscal  stimulus  package.  Although \ninfrastructure spending is now close to 4% of GDP, it is still insufficient to sustain the country's \naspirations of growth of 6% or higher as well as growing demand from infrastructure users. The \ngovernment projects that an additional annual infrastructure investment of 2% of GDP is needed \nto  increase  access  for  the  marginalized  segments  of  the  population,  and  satisfy  the  large \npopulation lacking access to basic infrastructure services. \n   \nThe government\u2019s priority assigned to infrastructure, and the role of the private sector in \n3. \nproviding it, was first emphasized during the 2005 Infrastructure Summit as the first high profile \npublic\u2013private dialogue. It sent strong messages to global investors about the willingness of the \ngovernment  to  support  the  infrastructure  agenda.  At  the  time,  the  government  estimated  that \nabout $65 billion would be needed in new infrastructure investments, with $25 billion (38%) to \nbe  sourced  from  its  budget;  $14  billion  (22%)  from  domestic  banks,  insurance,  and  pension \nfunds;  $10  billion  (15%)  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners;  and  $16 billion \n(25%) from domestic and foreign private sector investors.  \n \n4. \nThe government fully recognized that private sector participation could not be taken for \ngranted,  and  that  major  structural  and  institutional  reforms  were  needed.  The  IRSDP, \nformulated  jointly  by  the  government  and  its  principal  development  partners,  supports  a \ncomprehensive medium-term reform agenda in various infrastructure sectors. The program loan \nsupports three key reform components, which are (i) strategic cross-sectoral reforms, (ii) sector-\nspecific  reforms  for  transportation,  power,  oil  and  gas,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and \ntelecommunications; and (iii) facilitation of the preparation of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) \nresulting in sound model infrastructure projects that can be replicated. \n \n5. \nThe  IRSDP  comprises  a  cluster  of  three  subprograms,  a  project  development  facility \n(PDF) for the preparation and execution of PPP infrastructure projects, and technical assistance \n\n                                                 \n1   The Sector Assessment (Summary): Infrastructure (linked document accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fincreasing  access \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ninfrastructure  bottlenecks  and \n\n(TA)  for  enhancing  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  provision.2 In  November  2006, \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $400  million  for  subprogram \n1(disbursed  and  closed  in  November  2006),  a  loan  of  $26.5  million  equivalent  for  the  project \ndevelopment  facility,  a  grant  of  $2.0  million  for  the  TA,  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  $7.6 \nmillion grant provided by the Government of the Netherlands for the PDF facility.3 The facility is \ndesigned  to  help  the  government  (i)  prepare  feasibility  studies  for  national  and  decentralized \nregional  PPP  projects,  (ii)  adopt  open  and  transparent  bidding  processes,  and  (iii)  execute \nproject transactions. In December 2008, ADB approved a loan for $280 million for subprogram 2 \n(disbursed  and  closed  in  December  2008).4 The  current  proposal  comprises  a  loan  of  $200 \nmillion for subprogram 3.   \n \nB. \n \nThe IRSDP, of which subprogram 3 is an integral part, will improve Indonesia\u2019s overall \n6. \ninvestment  climate  by  removing \nto \ninfrastructure services, and thereby support timely realization of the government\u2019s medium-term \nmacroeconomic  goals,  in  particular  average  GDP  growth  of  6%\u20137%  per  annum  during  2010\u2013\n2014.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  IRSDP  will  be  accelerated  infrastructure  development \nthrough major private sector participation and mobilization of additional public sector resources. \nThe  impact  of  the  IRSDP  has  been  positive.  GDP  growth  accelerated  from  5.0%  in  2004  to \n6.8%  in  2009  following  the  2008  global  economic  crisis,  and  infrastructure  investments  rose \nfrom 2.9% of GDP in 2005 to about 4% in 2008 with these levels being maintained if not higher \nfor 2009 and 2010. In 2006, the government planned to increase capital spending on national \npublic  infrastructure  by  at  least  25%  by  2010  but  managed  an  increase  of  90%.  Similarly \ninvestments for increasing piped water connections rose to $296 million in 2009 from $30 million \nin  2007,  the  electrification  ratio  rose  to  65%  at  the  beginning  of  2009  from  62%  in  2004,  and \npercentage of national roads in good and/or fair condition increased to 86% in 2010 from 81% in \n2006. These outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the reforms under the IRSDP program \nand the experience suggests the usefulness of dialogue in advancing new ideas with key policy \nmakers, as well as the importance of regular dialogue to maintain the momentum on the reforms \nbeing undertaken.  \n \nThe  PDF  facility  with  a  total  funding  of  $34.1  million  will  help  maintain  the  pace  of \n7. \ninfrastructure  reforms  because  it  is  project  based.  Further  ongoing  support  will  also  be \nchanneled  through  infrastructure  finance  and  the  operations  of  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure \nFinance Facility (IIFF).  \n \n8. \nThe IRSDP was designed as a cluster of three single-tranche subprograms, supporting \nthree  core  areas:  (i)  cross-sectoral  reforms,  (ii)  sector-specific  reforms,  and  (iii)  facilitation  of \nPPPs. The design has proved to be resilient, and appropriate. Subprogram 3 initially comprised \n70  policy  actions  with  75  outputs.  Without  affecting  the  overall  thrust  of  the  IRSDP,  6  outputs \nwere  dropped  taking  into  account  changing  circumstances  without  affecting  the  overall  reform \nagenda.5 Delays were incurred on 5 of the 6 outputs because ministerial regulations took longer \nthan  expected  for  the  sector  operational  guidelines  manual  and  implementation  of  the  waste \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

As  for  the  deleted  output  on  a \nlocal \nregulation  governing  regional  water  supply  enterprise  (PDAM)  management  by \ngovernments,  this  action  has  been superseded  by  other  actions  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF).   \n \nC. \n \n9. \nto enhance infrastructure provision across all sectors (Table 1). \n \n\nThe overall IRSDP program, including subprogram 3, supports three core reform areas \n\nOutputs \n\nTable 1: Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Outputs \n \n\nOutputs \nStrategic cross- \nsectoral reforms \n\nSubprogram 1 \nPrivate sector participation framework to \nensure competitive selection projects \n\nSubprograms 2 and 3\u00aa \n\nFunctional Infrastructure Guarantee Fund \n(Indonesia) \n\nSector-specific \nreforms \n\nUpdated sector plans \n\nTransparent risk-sharing decisions \n\nStreamlined land acquisition framework \n\nRegulatory and contracting bodies for toll \nroad and gas projects \n\nCost recovery in road and water supply \nprojects \n\nTen candidate model PPP projects worth \nup to $4.5 billion identified and \npreparation started \n\nFacilitation of PPP \nprojects \n\nEqual access and opportunities for all \nparticipants in the sector \n\nIndependent regulation for toll roads, gas, \nwater supply, and telecommunications \n\nSelected model PPP contracted out and \nconstruction started \n\nBidding for significant number of additional \nPPPs \n\n\u00aaSubprograms 2 and 3 are grouped under a single heading because operationally they are closely linked. \nPPP = public\u2013private partnership. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\n1. \n\nCross-sectoral reforms \n\n \nThe IRSDP has played an important role in creating the enabling environment for PPPs \n10. \nby  supporting  the  development  of  a  cross-sectoral  policy  and  legal  framework  defining  PPPs. \nMost recently, the President signed Decree 13/2010 to update Decree 67/2005, clarify issues in \nareas such as providing support to national and subnational projects, and require government \npurchase of project land prior to issuing PPP concessions. MOF has prepared draft regulations \nthat  will  revise  the  PPP  government  support  framework  and  formally  operationalize  the \nIndonesia  Infrastructure  Guarantee  Fund  (IIGF),  which  was  launched  in  May  2010  and  is \ndesigned to be a credible guarantee provider for PPP projects. \n \n11. \nOperating  guidelines  have  been  prepared  for  the  preparation  of  PPP  projects,  and  the \ngovernment  is  presently  preparing  supporting  documents  to  guide  project  preparation  at  the \nsector level. Institutional reforms have led to the separation of policy and regulatory functions in \nsectors such as transport, energy, and water. Regulations now permit line agencies such as the \nMinistry of Transport and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to establish PPP nodes \nto develop projects.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n12. \nThe  government  has  made  progress  in  establishing  financing  mechanisms  to  support \npublic  and  private  sector  portions  of  PPP  projects.  The  public  service  obligation  (PSO) \nframework  has  been  successfully  implemented  in  the  energy  sector,  and  payments  are  being \nmade to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) every 3 months. The PSO framework provides \nPLN with the necessary liquidity to continue operations. The IIFF6 was established through the \njoint efforts of MOF, ADB, DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH) and \nthe  World  Bank,  and  is  now  in  the  process  of  obtaining  a  license  so  that  it  can  commence \noperations. IIFF  is  expected  to  be  an  important  source  of  PPP  project  preparation  advice  and \nlong-term local currency finance. \n \n13. \nThe government has taken steps to resolve land acquisition issues and submitted a draft \nland  acquisition  law  to  Parliament  to  replace  a  law  dating  back  to  1961  and  requiring  the \ngovernment  to  acquire  land  in  the  public  interest  for  infrastructure  projects.  The  new  law  will \nembrace the following five basic principles: (i) land appropriation for public purposes should not \nbe  hampered;  (ii)  landowners  will  not  suffer  losses  if  their  land  is  taken;  (iii)  real  estate \nspeculation  will  not  be  allowed;  (iv)  land  appropriation  procedures  should  conform  to  best \ninternational practices; and (iv) land appropriation should take into account current land disputes \nin Indonesia and, to minimize conflict, be respectful of the history of the people. The new law, \nexpected  to  be  enacted  in  2011,  will  remove  one  of  the  most  important  constraints  on  PPP \nproject preparation. MOF has announced that it will establish a land fund that will operationalize \nthe requirement for the government to procure land under Perpres 13/2010. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector-specific reforms \n\n \n14. \nTransportation  sector  reforms.  Laws  on  railways  (23/2007),  shipping  (17/2008), \naviation (1/2009), and road traffic and transportation (22/2009) were enacted to separate policy \nand  regulatory  functions  from  operations.  Tariff  regulations  based  on  cost  recovery  principles \nhave been put in place. Most implementing regulations identified in the policy matrix have been \nimplemented or are in the process of being implemented. The outstanding regulations that have \nnot yet been approved primarily relate to issues such as technical and safety standards, which \nwill  not  act  as  constraints  to  private  sector  participation.  Various  port  and  rail  projects  have \nalready  been  approved  for  development,  and  a  number  of  these  projects  (e.g.,  Central \nKalimantan  Railway  and  Soekarno  Hatta\u2013Manggarai  Railway  Link  in  Jakarta)  are  expected  to \nbe  structured  as  PPPs.  Once  the  new  land  law  is  in  place,  road  projects,  such  as  the  Trans-\nJava road projects, will start to move forward.  \n \n15. \nEnergy  sector  reforms.  New  laws  on  energy  (30/2007)  and  electricity  (30/2009) \nprovide  the  basis  for  permitting  private  sector  participation  in  the  power  subsector  on  a \ncompetitive basis. Implementation of these laws has been delayed and five of six implementing \nregulations  are  still  pending.7 However,  this  does  not  appear  to  be  acting  as  a  constraint  on \nprivate  sector  investment  in  power  generation;  several  power  purchase  agreements  were \nsigned  in  2010,  and  the  concession  for  the  Central  Java  Power  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncompetitively tendered as a PPP in 2010. A great deal of private sector interest is apparent in \ngeothermal power projects, and several concessions are expected to be financed as PPPs.  \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB, through a private sector project, provides $40 million for a 20% equity stake in IIFF and a 25-year loan of up \nto $100 million to the government-owned infrastructure holding company PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur, which will \nrelend the loan to IIFF as subordinated debt. \n\n7   The Energy Law includes three regulations: one on energy conservation (GR 70/2009 already completed) and two \non renewable energy and energy supply and utilization (drafted for consultation). The Electricity Law includes three \nregulations: supply, support of business, and cross-border trade; the draft is now complete for consultation. \n\n\f \n16.  Water  sector  reforms. Funding requirements of the PDAM debt rescheduling program \nhave  hindered  progress  in  the  water  sector;  however,  the  government  has  made  significant \nsteps by launching the restructuring program in 2009. Although a new law on local government \nenterprises  that  would  provide  greater  autonomy  to  the  PDAMs  has  yet  to  be  enacted,  many \nPDAMs  have  started  preparing  the  business  plans  necessary  for  encouraging  greater \ninvestment  in  their  operations.  Some  examples  include  several  large  bulk  water  PPP \nconcessions being developed by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)-\nfunded Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative Program in Java.  \n \n17. \nThe potential for pursuing PPPs in the solid waste sector is high. Several projects have \nbeen implemented in Jakarta and Bali on a competitive bidding basis instead of a business-to-\nbusiness approach indicating that progress is being made. The government enacted the law on \nenvironment (32/2009), which provides the framework for environment standards. The separate \nwaste  management  law  (18/2008)  requires  all  stakeholders  to  uphold  waste  management \npolicies across the country.  \n \n18. \nfully \ncompetitive with 11 public and private companies offering one of the lowest tariffs in Asia. Fixed-\nline density is about 3.7% and cellular phone density 6.9%. The Ministry of Communication and \nInformation issued Decree 02/2010 on the Strategic Plan for 2010\u20132014. In particular, under the \ngovernment-promoted  universal  service  obligation  scheme,  telephone  services  are  being \nextended to 10,000 remote villages, bringing the number of villages connected to around 32,000 \n(out of approximately 70,000).  \n \n\nTelecommunications  sector  reforms.  The \n\ntelecommunications  sector \n\nis \n\n3. \n\nFacilitation of public-private partnerships \n\n \n19. \nStatus  of  PPP  transactions.  In  March  2010,  two  independent  power  producers  (PT \nPaiton Energy for a 815-megawatt expansion of the East Java Power Plant and Cirebon Electric \nPower for the 660-megawatt Cirebon Power, West Java) were initiated with financing from the \nJapan  Finance  Corporation.  Moreover  the  specific  PPP  output  under  subprogram  3  (financial \nclosure for two PPP projects, prepared and tendered in full compliance with Perpres 13/2010) is \nprogressing although their financial closure is expected in 2011. Tendering has been initiated for \nthree PPP projects: (i) Solo\u2013Kertosono Toll Road, (ii) Central Java Power Plant, and (iii) Central \nKalimantan  Coal  Railway.  BAPPENAS  has  offered  another  six  projects  including  (i)  Bandung \nWaste-to-Energy  Project;  (ii)  Soekarno  Hatta\u2013Manggarai  Railway  Link;  (iii)  Tukad  Unda  Water \nSupply,  Bali;  (iv) Tanah  Ampo  Cruise  Ship  Terminal,  Bali;  (v)  Maros  Water  Supply,  South \nSulawesi;  and  (vi) Umbulan  East  Java  Water  Supply.  While  some  of  these  projects  may  face \nissues  in  terms  of  investment  size  (e.g.,  Tanah  Ampo  Cruise  Ship  Terminal  and  Maros  Water \nSupply)  or  viability  (Soekarno  Hatta\u2013Manggarai  Railway  Link),  achieving  financial  closure  is \nlikely for at least three projects totaling $3 billion during 2011\u20132012. These are the Central Java \nPower  Plant,  Central  Kalimantan  Coal  Railway,  and  Umbulan  East  Java  Water  Supply.  Aside \nfrom  the  current  BAPPENAS  list  of  projects,  a  pipeline  of  other  projects  are  being  prepared \ngiven  the  improved  enabling  framework  for  PPP  and  increased  investor  interest  in  the \nIndonesian market. In short, PPP transactions are anticipated to accelerate, particularly with the \nestablishment of IIFF and the IIGF. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nBased  on  its  financing  requirement  and  planned  borrowing  from  other  sources,  the \ngovernment has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \n\nProgram Costs and Financing  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nless \n\nfor  2010 \n\nfinancing  gap \n\nto  maintain  a  budget  deficit  of \n\nfinance the program. Subprogram 3 is a continuation of subprograms 1 and 2, and the intensity \nand  significance  of  the  policy  content  in  terms  of  actions  and  outputs  is  comparable  to  the \nprevious  subprograms  and  completes  the  three  subprogram  cluster.  The  loan  size  was \ndetermined by the strength of the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the \nsectors covered, and the adjustment costs including land capping ($100 million), revitalization of \nPDAMs  ($400  million),  support  for  the  Government  Investment  Unit  ($100  million.  The  IRSDP \nprogram also called for successfully undertaking some key reforms which were politically very \nsensitive such as mandating open and competitive bidding under revised Perpres 13/2010 and \nfacilitating  passage  of  the  Electricity  Law  which  had  been  previously  annulled  by  the \nConstitutional Court in 2004. Furthermore, the proposed subprogram loan will also help to close \nthe \nthan  2.1%.  \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i) the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n21. \nIn parallel, the World Bank is also considering a similar loan of $200 million for the fourth \nsubprogram of its Infrastructure Development Policy Loan,8 which is scheduled for consideration \nby the World Bank\u2019s Board on 18 November 2010. \n \n22. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items,  and  imports  financed  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor  Program  Loans,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  to  disburse  the  loan  proceeds \nbased  on  certification  by  the  borrower. 9 Subprogram  3  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for \neligible  expenditures  incurred  up  to  180  days  prior  to  loan  and  grant  effectiveness.  ADB  will \nretain  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  withdrawal \napplication certification.  \n \n23. \nThe Government of Japan will provide a $100 million loan on a parallel cofinancing basis \n(direct value added, collaborative) for subprogram 3 of the IRSDP, as it did for subprograms 1 \nand 2. This is expected to be approved in March 2011 (Table 2).  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n200.00 \n100.00 \n300.00 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nJapan International Cooperation Agency  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n \n24. \nfor  coordinating \nresponsible \n                                                 \n8  Subprogram 4 is the final tranche of the World Bank\u2019s Infrastructure Development Policy Loan series.  \n9   ADB. 1998.

These \n26. \ninclude a reduced fiscal burden from the gradual removal of the fuel subsidy and improved cost \nrecovery  in  all  infrastructure  sectors.  A  road  map  for  fuel  subsidy  was  prepared  and  is  being \ndiscussed  internally.  The  PSO  policy  framework  provides  the  basis  for  better  targeting  of \ninfrastructure  service  provision,  connectivity,  and  access  for  low-income  groups.  The  PDAM \ndebt-restructuring  program,  which  commenced  in  2009,  will  reverse  the  decline  in  service \nquality and coverage of water supply and sanitation. PLN\u2019s restructuring in December 2009 and \na  tariff  hike  of  10%  for  higher  income  consumers  in  July  2010  will  help  lower  the  government \nsubsidy while improving PLN\u2019s efficiency. Passage of the Electricity Law (30/2009) will provide \nthe foundation for medium- to long-term improvements in electricity supply and efficiency as the \nconditions  for  private  sector  investment  begin  to  improve  and  subsequent  investment  in \ngeneration  increases,  in  turn  improving  the  overall  investment  climate.  The  introduction  of \nindependent  transport  and  utility  regulators  in  the  longer  term  will  remove  government \ninterference  in  utility  operations  and  pricing,  providing  the  basis  for  improved  efficiencies. \nEconomic benefits are expected to accrue from improved quality of existing roads through better \nroad maintenance and vehicle load control, and expanded road networks; improved access to \nmarkets  and  other  forms  of  connectivity;  and  lower  vehicle  operating  costs.  Major  general \neconomic benefits will accrue to the entire Indonesian population through the expanded scope \nand improved quality of infrastructure services. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \nGovernance \n\ntransparency, \n\nthe  government  has  considerably  strengthened \n\nB. \n \n27. \nThe IRSDP is strengthening the key institutions dealing with infrastructure development \nin Indonesia. At the national level, KKPPI, its secretariat, and MOF\u2019s risk management unit are \nevolving  into  institutions  that  coordinate  central  support  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure development. The PPP unit located at the BAPPENAS central office is providing \nsupport  for  the  development  of  infrastructure  projects  covering  all  sectors.  Within  each \ninfrastructure  sector,  the  regulatory  bodies  will  be  strengthened  over  the  medium  term  by \nenhancing their autonomy, clarifying their mandate, and providing adequate resources for their \noperations.  The  newly  established  IIFF  provides  long-term  financing  for  private-sector-led \ninfrastructure  projects  and  is  timely  given  the  financing  difficulties  for  private  infrastructure \ninvestment as a result of the global financial crisis. The recently launched IIGF provides public \nsector contingent liability support for PPP projects.  \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  BAPPENAS.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and \nits \nanticorruption  efforts  under  the  incumbent  President  since  he  first  rose  to  power  on  an  anti-\ncorruption  platform  in  2004.  Similarly  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  also  pointed  out \ndeficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s efforts in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. \nThe government has been reforming procurement for some time, resulting in a competitive and \nrelatively  transparent  selection  of  bidders  by  the  public  sector.  The  private  sector  participation \nregulatory framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, sets out clear guidelines for the selection \nof private sector sponsors. KKPPI is tasked with ensuring that the tendering processes are fair \nand transparent. Furthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile \nand  visibility  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  to  deal \neffectively with corruption. These steps are already having a positive impact. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  IRSDP\u2019s  main  contribution  is  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  thereby \ncontribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction  through  greater  access  to  markets,  and  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  policy  reforms  are  intended  to  lead  to  increased  infrastructure \ninvestments by the public and private sectors. On balance, the poverty and social impacts of the \nreforms  and  ensuing  investments  will  be  positive,  through  the  benefits  of  induced  economic \ngrowth and the improved provision of infrastructure services. The increase in domestic oil prices \nby  almost  30%  in  May  2008  also  freed  up  much-needed  additional  funds  for  more  pro-poor \nspending. The government is constantly reviewing tariff policies in all sectors and attempting to \nadopt tariff regimes that are in line with cost-recovery principles. At the same time, the impact of \ntariff increases on the poor is mitigated through appropriate measures such as conditional cash \ntransfer  programs.  Potential  negative  impacts  include  social  dislocation  and  inadequate \ncompensation for land acquisition. The government established the Land Working Group to deal \nwith  issues  of  land  zoning  and  purchase  of  land  in  anticipation  of  future  infrastructure \ndevelopments;  the  results  will  be  incorporated  in  the  new  land  law  expected  in  2011.  Overall, \nthe IRSDP is leading to significant social benefits. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe  IRSDP  has  been  classified  under  environment  category  C  since  its  onset  as  the \nIRSDP  measures  are  unlikely  to  have  any  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  involuntary \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nresettlement and indigenous people impacts categories are also C. As for future investments in \ninfrastructure  by  either  the  public  or  private  sector  or  by  PPP  modality,  existing  presidential \nregulations 36/2005  and  65/2006  recognize  traditional communal  land ownership  and  usufruct \nrights. In line with the regulatory provisions, the rights of indigenous peoples are upheld in case \nof  any  land  acquisition  involving  them.  These  provisions  are  in  conformity  with  requirements \noutlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Most  of  the  reforms  supported  by  the \nIRSDP help improve environmental outcomes through better sanitation, higher electricity prices \nto  promote  energy  conservation,  promotion  of  recycling,  and  sanitary  landfills.  Furthermore, \nwhile  the  IRSDP  facilitates  the  preparation  and  tendering  of  several  PPP  projects,  it  does  not \nprovide any investment support to such projects and the government ensures that all social and \nenvironmental safeguards are complied with in line with the prevailing laws and regulations. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nGovernment commitment. The government confirms that it remains strongly committed \nto  the  reform  program  embodied  in  the  IRSDP  and  the  complementing  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Policy Loan program. The 2014 elections pose only a moderate risk of weakened \ncommitment  and  a  loss  of  the  reform  momentum,  as  even  with  a  change  of  government,  the \nnext  leaders  are  expected  to  continue  focusing  on  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  to \nensure a sound tenure in office and mitigate the risk of social and political unrest.  \n \n32. \nGovernment capacity and coordination. While the government remains committed to \nreform objectives, the ability to translate that commitment into practical reform achievements is \nsubject to available capacity within the different government ministries and agencies. In several \nareas,  progress  has  been  slower  than  anticipated  by  the  government  when  the  IRSDP  was \nagreed  upon.  This  has  typically  been  the  result  of  low  capacity.  Mitigation  strategies  include \nrealistic outputs and schedules based on likely reform progress, and continued provision of TA \nfor  capacity  building.  The  ongoing  TA,  attached  to  the  first  subprogram  (footnote  3),  is \naddressing  capacity  constraints  at  BAPPENAS  and  MOF.  In  some  instances,  the  progress  of \ninfrastructure  reforms  has  been  impeded  by  poor  coordination  among  government  ministries \nand  agencies,  and  competing  and  conflicting  interests  of  various  stakeholders.  While  full  and \neffective coordination and reforms in certain sectors may take time to evolve and need further \nconsensus  building,  the  essential  steps  taken  thus  far  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  in \nsupporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner in the coming years.  \n \n33. \nGovernance.  With  the  high  stakes  involved  in  large  infrastructure  projects  in  several \nsectors, the IRSDP may face significant impediments in the form of weak governance, collusion \nand corruption, or lack of judicial capacity to enforce good governance measures. In particular, \ndespite  the  commendable  rigid  stance  taken  by  MOF,  risks  of  misallocation  of  scarce  public \nresources could still be encountered during the transition period, leading to government support \nfor directly negotiated projects or projects that do not meet all relevant criteria for such support. \nHowever,  the  government  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anticorruption  efforts  through  the \nestablishment of the Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies, as well \nas tightening national procurement guidelines. \n \n34.  Macroeconomic  stability.  Domestic  macroeconomic  volatility,  adverse  global  events \nsuch as high oil and food prices, or natural disasters could impede private sector participation. \nIndonesia  has  considerable  gross  financing  needs  and  the  cost  of  meeting  these  will  almost \ncertainly go up if outlays on oil subsidies and budgetary financing needs continue to increase. In \nsuch an environment, a sharp deterioration in global economic conditions could make Indonesia \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  sudden  shifts  in  investor  sentiment,  possibly  triggering  rapid  capital \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\noutflows  and  increasing  the  risks  of  broader  financial  sector  disruption.  However,  since  2006, \nthe  Indonesian  economy  has  been  quite  resilient  to  domestic  and  external  shocks  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policies have been sound. \n \nSocial  issues.  Tariff  reforms  are  sensitive  in  any  environment,  and  Indonesia  is  no \n35. \nexception.  As  the  country  is  gradually  moving  away  from  administered  prices  and  tariffs  for \ninfrastructure  products  and  services,  social  tensions  are  inevitable.  However,  the  government \nhas  so  far  been  successful  in  reducing  such  tensions  by  use  of  the  two-pronged  approach  of \n(i) comprehensively socializing any planned price and tariff increases, and (ii) using the savings \nfrom the reduction in inefficient subsidies for  direct poverty reduction, employment generation, \nand rural infrastructure development. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n36. \nThe  government  and  BAPPENAS  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  loan  documents.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the \ngovernment  has  given  the  following  additional  assurances,  which  are  also  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents:  \n(i) \n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 3 loan will be \nused  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined  under  the  subprogram  3 \nimplementation arrangements. \nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  3  loan \nagreement, as described in the letter of development policy (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue to be in effect after the completion of the IRSDP. \nThe studies and technical designs prepared for PPP projects will broadly comply \nwith all relevant ADB requirements, policies, and guidelines. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Recommendations  resulting  from  the  work  done  under  the  technical  assistance \n(footnote 2) will be implemented to the fullest extent possible, and within a timely \nmanner. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the \nInfrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n \nC.

ADB, JICA and the World Bank have targeted different areas of the Government's infrastructure \nreform program. Key policy actions have been included in the World Bank IDPL4, that should be read \nin  conjunction  with  the  appropriate  IDPL  policy  matrix,  while  a  complementary  set  of  policy  actions \nhave been included in the ADB IRSDP3 policy matrix, for which JICA is providing joint support. \n\nIDPL4  and  IRSDP3  are  the  last  in  the  programmatic  series  of  loans  targeting  infrastructure \ndevelopment. As such, we would like to offer some concluding remarks on the general effectiveness of \nthe IDPL1-4 and IRSDPI-3 series. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThe World Bank's Infrastructure Development Policy Loan \n\nNational  Infrastructure.  A  major  hurdle  for  improved  infrastructure  in  Indonesia  has  been  the \nsignificant dip in infrastructure spending following the 1998 financial crisis. Over the course of the \nfour-year  IDPL  dialogue,  infrastructure  spending  has  grown  steadily.  Beyond  the  higher  levels  of \npublic finance, the Government has sought to implement a multi-sector reform program that enables \ngreater  access  to  infrastructure  services.  Of  special  note  are  the  policy  efforts  to  maintain  public \nallocation for infrastructure at both the national (APBN) and sub-national (APBD) levels, which as of \ntoday  are  higher  than  those  levels  anticipated  under  the  IDPL  series.  At  the  national  level  the \nallocations have been more than three times the targets. In addition, reforms in the power and water \nsectors are beginning to show promising results. \n\nIn  the  power  sector,  a  tariff  adjustment  that  has  been  stipulated  through  Ministerial  Regulation  No. \n712010 which regulates the average tariff increase up to 10% is expected to achieve the above targets. \nIt is highlighted that by this regulation, a better pricing policy also signals a better investment climate \nin electricity sector. As a result, we are considering a tariff adjustment mechanism that would place the \nsector on a stronger financial footing thereby encouraging more investments in the electricity sector. \n\nFor Roads financing, medium-term planning has begun and medium-term budgeting has been initiated \nby the Ministry of Public Works (MoPW) in close consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) \nand the World Bank. For the Road Preservation Fund, presidential decrees are being drafted that will \nestablish management, organization and governance guidelines for the Fund. \n\nSub-National  Infrastructure.  In  the  water  sector,  an  increasing  number  of  PDAMs  are  being \nfinancially restructured, supported by a robust intercept mechanism which will allow the restarting of \npublic  support  for  those  utilities.  Moreover,  public  support  will  be  implemented  through  an  output-\nbased  Hibah  grants  mechanism  that  was  recently  initiated  to  increase  connections  as  well  as  a \nguarantee/subsidy scheme for commercial bank lending to PDAMs. \n\nPublic-Private  Partnerships.  There  has  been  some  progress  in  the  area  of  Public  Private \nPartnerships  (PPP).  The  financial  architecture  is  almost  complete  as  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure \nFinancing  Facility  JIFF)  and  the  Indonesia  Guarantee  Fund  (IGF)  are  both  expected  to  become \noperational this year. Despite progress in the institutional set-up, the system remains challenged when \nit comes to supporting credible PPP transactions. \n\nEnvironment  and  Governance.  Beyond  hard  infrastructure  spending,  the  IDPL  series  has  been \nhelpful  in  supporting  and  strengthening  the  governance  of  the  MoPW  in  its  basic  operations  and \npolicies. These include the introduction of electronically-based procurement systems as well as  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                     Appendix 4     29   \n\n \n\n \n\nthe introduction of Risk-Based Internal Audit programs throughout MoPW. The MoPW has initiated \naudit programs for its activities in up to 12 provincial offices. In the area of land acquisition, several \nministries and agencies are drafting a major piece of legislation governing land acquisition that will \nmake the process `faster' and `fairer' for all, particularly the poor. \n\nADB and JICA's Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Loan \n\nThe  IRSDP  has  supported  the  Government's  strategy  of  accelerating  infrastructure  development \nthrough  large-scale  private  sector  participation.  To  provide  a  conducive  environment  for  private \ninvestments,  a  comprehensive  policy,  regulatory  and  institutional  framework,  which  is  in  line  with \ninternational  best  practices,  has  been  established.  The  new  framework  has  still  to  pass  the  test  of \nsuccessful implementation of public-private partnership projects in order to signal Indonesia's readiness \nfor private investment. The Government and development partners should therefore focus their efforts \non the preparation and execution of public private partnership (PPP) projects in the pipeline that could \nbe replicated in the future. \n\nThe IRSDP has highlighted the importance of having reform champions at the highest levels of the \nGovernment  to  provide  guidance  on  the  direction  and  pace  of  reforms,  as  well  as  of  building  up \nownership at the middle government levels and in state-owned enterprises to ensure effective reform \nimplementation. Given the natural inertia of these constituencies and the fact that some infrastructure \nreforms run counter to their interests, this task needs time and perseverance. \n\nGood governance in both public and private provision of infrastructure is central to ensuring mutual \naccountability.  The  Government  has  implemented  reforms  in  public  procurement  to  enhance \ntransparency  and  thereby  reduce  the  scope  for  corruption.  The  new  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  development  has  introduced  transparency  and  competition  into  the \nselection of private sector sponsors, instead of the previous approach of direct negotiations. \n\nThe  key  bottleneck  has  been  land  acquisition  and  the  prospects  for  addressing  the  land  acquisition \nchallenge are increasingly positive. First, Perpres 1312010 requires that the central or local government \nhas  to  acquire  land  before  a  PPP  project  is  tendered.  Second,  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of \ndeveloping a new Land Acquisition Law that is anticipated to be passed in early 2011. The proposed \nLaw  will  build  on  the  previous  reform  measures  to  introduce  compensation  based  on  market  rather \nthan taxable value, freezing land prices at a specific point in time for negotiation purposes, and setting \nup  a  predictable  and  time-bound  system  for  negotiating  and  resolving  the  final  payment  to  the \nlandowners.  It  will  be  important  to  continue  to  track  developments  related  to  streamlining  land \nacquisition. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fConcluding Remarks \n\nWe understand that infrastructure investment and maintenance is still too low in order to sustain current and \nobtain  targeted  economic  growth  rates.  The  creation  of  adequate  new  employment  opportunities  and \nexpanding  access  to  basic  infrastructure  services  will  require  vast  improvements  in  basic  transport,  energy, \nwater provision and other infrastructure areas.
