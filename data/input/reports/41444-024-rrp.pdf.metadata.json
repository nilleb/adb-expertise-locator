As  part  of  the  Viet  Nam \nportion  of  the  current  project,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  loan  in  the \namount  of  SDR47,450,000  (equivalent  to  $75  million)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nloan became effective on 7 June 2011, with a closing date of 31 December 2016.5 \n \nThe  current  project  is  performing  well.  The  implementation  is  on  track. 6  Cumulative \n5.\n \ncontract awards were 85.6% and disbursements 41.0% as of 7 October 2015. Disbursements are \nexpected  to  increase  by  the  end  of  2015,  as  high-value  pavement  works  commenced  in \nSeptember  2015. The  current  implementation  schedule  to  complete  the  physical  works  by  June \n2016 appears to be achievable, and the need for a loan closing date extension is  not foreseen. \nWith  regard  to  safeguards,  the  resettlement  plans  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nhave  been  implemented  without  major  issues.  Lapses  in  the  EMP  implementation  are  being \naddressed through agreed remedial actions such as water spraying and installation of mesh net to \nentrap dust in crashing plant and providing personal protective equipment to construction workers. \nThe government has been tracking grievances, and there are currently no unresolved grievances. \n \n \n6.\n\nThe  civil  works  under  the  current  project  scope  include  (i)  improvement  of  the  road \n\n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

As the road conditions between \nkm  59.9  (Cam  Thuy)  and  Ba  Thuoc  have  significantly  deteriorated  during  2011\u20132015  due  to \nincreased  traffic  volume  (coming  from  Na  Meo,  Ha  Noi,  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City)  and  vehicle \noverloading,  in  May  2014  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  requested  ADB  to  consider  providing \nadditional financing for full-scale improvement of the road section from Cam Thuy to Ba Thuoc \nrather than simple repair as originally planned. \n \n7.\n \nThe  fact-finding  mission  conducted  by  ADB  in  March  2015  assessed  that  the  overall \nproject  will  enhance  the  outcome  of  the  current  project  by  delivering  a  technically  sound  road \nsection  from  Cam  Thuy  to  Ba  Thuoc  with  higher  design  speed.  This  additional  financing  will \nprovide (i) wider lanes to meet the increased traffic flow, (ii) strengthened pavement structure to \ncarry  more  loads,  (iii)  better  road  alignment  to  avoid  the  flood-prone  areas,  (iv)  safer  bridges, \nand (v) improved drainage facilities. The mission and the government agreed to eliminate traffic \ncongestion  and  improve  road safety  by  constructing  a  new  flyover  at  the  intersection  at km  0, \nwhere Highway 217 intersects with Highway 1. \n \n8.\n \nIn  addition  to  road  improvement,  the  additional  financing  will  support  the  effort  of  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  (MOT)  to  control  the  overloading  on  the  national  road  network  and  to \nstrengthen road maintenance management through (i) reviewing existing governing procedures \nto  control  the  overloading;  (ii)  purchasing  weigh  scales  and  providing  on-the-job  training  for \nMOT  staff  on  the  use  and  maintenance  of  such  equipment;  (iii)  (after  completing  the  current \nproject)  piloting  control  of  overloading  on  the  improved  Na  Meo\u2013Ba  Thuoc  road  section  to \nprevent  premature  deterioration;  (iv)  strengthening  the  governing  procedures  based  on  the \nfindings from the pilot demonstration; and (v) monitoring the maintenance works that have been \nprovided for the completed road sections under the current project, and proposing a future road \nmaintenance program for the Na Meo\u2013Ha Trung corridor as a whole.  \n \n9.\n \nEligibility  of  additional  financing. The additional financing meets the eligibility criteria \nfor  additional  financing  as  the  project  is  (i)  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially  sound  based  on  the  due  diligence  assessments;  (ii)  accorded  high  priority  by  the \ngovernment  based  on  its  approval  of  the  project  outline  in  June  2015;  (iii)  consistent  with  the \ntransport  development  objectives  of  the  current  project  as  it  will  enhance  the  outcome  and \noutputs  of  the  current  project;  and (iv)  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u2013\n2015 for Viet Nam, which aims to enhance transport connectivity in GMS countries.7 Additional \nfinancing  is  a  suitable  modality,  since  scaling  up  the  originally  planned  minor  maintenance  to \nmajor repair works will result in financing requirements exceeding the original financial allocation. \nThe additional financing allows ADB to respond effectively to the change in circumstances the \ngovernment  is  facing  in  implementing  the  current  project.  This  additional  financing  will \ncomplement  the  MOT\u2019s  effort  to  sustain  its  road  network  by  delivering  a  better  approach  and \nwork  process  to  control  overloading  and  provide  good  road  services  through  the  provision  of \nregular maintenance on the completed road section as discussed in para 8. \n \n10.\n \nplan, 2015\u22122017 for Viet Nam, and was identified during a project review mission in 2014.8  \n \n11.\n \n\nImproved readiness. It is planned that the detailed design and construction supervision \n\nThis first additional financing for the project is included in the country operations business \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n\n\fin \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n(DDCS) consultants under the current project will (i) prepare detailed design of the project road \nsections, (ii) finalize the draft bidding documents for civil works and the request for proposal for \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  and  (iii)  assist \nthe  updating  and \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (REMDP)  using  the \nunallocated  amount  of  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Second  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  Transport  Network  Improvement  Project.  This  is  consistent  with  the  objective  of \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  additional  financing  to  promote  efficiency  gains  through  timely  and  seamless \ntransition from project preparation to implementation.9 \n \n12.\n \nA retroactive financing request by the government was approved on 28 August 2015 to \nensure  timely  commencement  of  civil  works  in  April  2016.  Government  funds  of  up  to  $14.2 \nmillion,  the  equivalent  of  20%  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan,  can  be  used  to  finance  eligible \nexpenditure related to land acquisition and resettlement, and advances to civil works contractors \nand construction supervision consultants (CSCs) to be engaged under the project. \n \nB. \n \n13.\n \nThe impact and outcome statements for the overall project will remain unchanged since \nthe  additional  financing  will  help  the  current  project  achieve  its  development  objective.  The \nimpact will be increased international trade on the GMS Northeastern Corridor. The outcome will \nbe efficient transport across the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border and on the project road sections of \nthe GMS Northeastern Corridor. \n \nC. \n \n14.\n \nThe project output statement will remain unchanged. The expected outputs of the overall \nproject will be (i) the project components of the GMS Northeastern Corridor in Viet Nam and the \nLao  PDR  are  improved,  and  (ii)  road  safety  on  the  project  road  sections  of  Northeastern \nCorridor is improved. Through the additional financing under output 1, (i) the road section from \nCam Thuy to Ba Thuoc will be improved, and (ii) a new flyover and approach roads in Ha Trung \nwill be constructed. Through the additional financing under output 2, (i) a road safety audit will \nbe  undertaken  on  the  project  road  sections,  and  (ii)  12  communes  along  the  project  road \nsections  will  increase  their  awareness  on  traffic  rules  and  regulations.  The  overall  project  will \nsupport  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program,  and  enable \nwomen to participate in implementation and monitoring of the project activities. \n \nD. \n \n15.\n \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $175.25  million  and  be  adequate  to  cover  the \ncost for the original and extended project investments. The revised investment plan is in Table 1. \nThe  detailed  cost  estimates  for  the  project  to  be  financed  by  each  financier  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).10 \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

PMU1 will consult and seek concurrence from ADB on the \nterms of reference and draft contract to be used for engaging an external monitoring agency. \n \n22.\n \nPMU1  will  use  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nand  procure  two  contract  packages  for  road  improvements  (with  two  lots)  and  flyover \nconstruction using the international competitive bidding method, and five contract  packages for \nutility  relocation  using  national  competitive  bidding.  The  proposed  review  method  and \nprocurement procedure are in the procurement plan. \n \n23.\n \nUse  of  loan  funds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  require  establishment  of \nsubaccounts  in  project  districts  in  Thanh  Hoa  Province.  The  fund  flow  and  cash  flow \narrangements are included in the PAM (footnote 9). AFLAR will be responsible for administering \nand monitoring loan funds for land acquisition and resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n24.\n \nthe PAM. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)   Implementation unit \nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nAugust 2016\u2013December 2018 \nDecember 2018 (loan account closing date: 30 June 2019) \n\n$3.140 million \n\n$1.750 million \n\n$44.260 million \n\nNational competitive bidding \n\nState Bank of Viet Nam, Chair and Members \nMinistry of Transport \nPMU1 (for implementing outputs 1 and 2); Agency for Land Acquisition and \nResettlement under Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee (for implementing the \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan. \nPMU1 with 12 staff at 308 Minh Khai, Hai Ba Trung, Ha Noi  \nTwo contracts (one for road \nInternational competitive \nimprovements [with two lots], \nbidding \nand one for flyover construction) \nFive contracts for utility removal \nand relocation \n53 person-months of \ninternational consultant inputs; \n454 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs \n50 person-months \n\nQuality- and cost-based \nselection for construction \nsupervision \n\nLeast-cost selection for \nexternal auditing \nGovernment procedure for \n(i)  external monitoring \nagency for resettlement; and \nconsultants for undertaking: \n(ii)  an appraisal of the \ndetailed design; \n(iii)  final statement audit; and \n(iv)  an external audit of \nconstruction quality \nAdvance contracting for recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works. \nRetroactive financing up to $14.2 million, the equivalent of 20% of the loan for land \nacquisition and resettlement, and advances to civil works contractors and consultants \nincurred before loan effectiveness (but not earlier than 12 months before loan \nsigning). \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time), with detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween the government and ADB. \n\n \n$0.107 million \n \n \n$0.030 million \n \n$0.062 million \n$0.103 million \n\n$0.110 million \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; PMU = Project Management Unit 1. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n25.\n \nUnder the current project, the DDCS consultants completed geological and hydrological \nsurveys and studies. Based on the results, they suggested climate change resilient measures (i) \nadjusting the road alignment in some sections to avoid flood-prone areas, and (ii) using a higher \ngradient on the paved shoulder of road sections passing through residential areas to allow for \nwater  drainage  to  side  ditches.  These  measures  are  compatible  with  the  local  conditions  and \nwill  enable  the  completed  road  sections  to  remain  open  to  users  and  traffic  in  all  weather \nconditions. \n \nB. \n \n26.\n \nEconomic.  All  works  under  the  additional  financing  are  viable;  the  average  economic \ninternal rate of return is 14.9%, and the net present value is $12.5 million at a 12% discount rate. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe upgrading of the segment of Highway 217 from Cam Thuy to Ba Thuoc will provide a better \nroad surface and allow higher speeds, which will reduce travel times and vehicle operating costs, \nand  account  for  an  overall  24%  reduction  in  travel  costs.  Traffic  on  this  segment  already \nreaches  7,700  vehicles  a  day  in  2015  (85%  motorcycles),  and  would  exceed  the  current  road \ncapacity before 2020. The new interchange at Ha Trung will reduce crash risks at the junction. It \nwill also improve traffic flows, preventing degradation of service on Highway 217 and Highway 1, \nwhich is the country\u2019s main road artery (above 20,000 vehicles per day at Ha Trung). Compared \nwith a without project scenario, the interchange will save up to 10 minutes of travel time per trip \nfor all Highway 217 and Highway 1 vehicles. Additional benefits from the avoidance of potential \nfuture flooding on Highway 217 and better safety were not included in the quantitative analysis, \nbut would improve the economic merit of the project. \n \n27.\n \nFinancial.  The  project  is  nonrevenue  generating.  Financial  analysis  assessed  the \nMOT\u2019s financial capacity to maintain the project, confirming that it can cover the recurrent costs \nto  sustain  the  project.  As  part  of  the  overall  road  sector  reform  process,  the  government \nestablished  a  Viet  Nam  National  Road  Maintenance  Fund  in  2012,  financed  from  vehicle \nregistration  fees  and  budgetary  allocations.  During  2013\u20132014,  the  fund\u2019s  revenue  increased \nfrom  D6.9  trillion  to  D8.0  trillion.  Since  2012,  the  government  has  been  providing  routine  and \nperiodic  maintenance  for  35,509  km  of  national  roads.  In  October  2014,  the  Thanh  Hoa \nProvincial  Department  of  Transport  awarded  a  contract  to  repair  six  segments  of  the  road \nsection  from  km  0  to  Cam  Thuy.  Further,  the  Viet  Nam  National  Road  Maintenance  Fund  is \nexpected  to  increase  by  improving  the  collection  of  vehicle  registration  fees  and  increasing \nbudgetary allocations to meet the maintenance needs for national roads, including the Na Meo\u2013\nHa Trung road corridor, and thus expected to ensure its long-term sustainability. \n \nC. \n \n28.\n \nExisting  procurement,  financial  management,  and  governance  mechanisms  will  remain \nunchanged.  As  a  result  of  having  undertaken  several  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  past, \nincluding the current project, the  MOT has extensive experience and a detailed understanding \nof  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management  policies  and  procedures.  Additionally,  the \nMOT has adequate procurement and financial management capacity. It will continue to use the \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  and  project  website  established  under  the  current  project. 12 \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe government, MOT, and PMU1. Government risks related to financial management are low, \nand this additional financing will follow established requirements within the current project. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nGovernance \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n29.\nThe  project  area  encompasses  poor  areas  in  Viet  Nam.  The  overall  project  expects  to \n \ndirectly  benefit  about  444,000  residents  in  the  project  areas  (Ba  Thuoc,  Cam  Thuy,  and  Ha \nTrung)  and  indirectly  benefit  Thanh  Hoa  Province\u2019s  population  of  3.4  million.  Poverty  rates  in \n2014  were  18.26%  in  Ba  Thuoc,  12.03%  in  Cam  Thuy,  and  6.2%  in  Ha  Trung.  Based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s  poverty  line  of  D400,000  per  head  per  month  in  rural  areas  and  D500,000  per \nhead  per  month  in  urban  areas,  Ba Thuoc  is  one  of  the  62  poorest  districts  in  Viet  Nam.  The \npoor households in the project areas tend to be from ethnic groups and/or have sick, disabled, \nor elderly family members who are unable to work. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Project Management Unit 1\u2013Ministry of Transport. http://pmu1.vn \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \nThe project will reduce poverty in the project areas by improving economic opportunities \n30.\nfor  local  producers,  including  women,  through  improved  access  to  markets  for  their  products \n(chicken,  ducks,  beef,  pigs,  rice,  and  bamboo).  The  improved  road  sections  will  give  the \nresidents,  including  the  poor,  better  access  to  public  facilities  such  as  hospitals,  schools,  and \npeople\u2019s  committee  buildings,  where  social  services  are  provided.  Women,  in  particular,  will \nbenefit  from  the  improved  access  to  maternal  health  services.  The  reduced  travel  times  and \ntransport costs will increase household incomes. The project is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming and, through the implementation of the gender action plan, will ensure equal job \nopportunities  and  equal  pay  for  equal  work  at  construction  sites.  It  includes  targets  for  the \nparticipation of women as community facilitators and as unskilled laborers at construction sites. \n \n31.\n \nSome negative social effects are also possible. However, they will be mitigated through \nproject  interventions.  All  project  areas  are affected  by  high rates of  HIV infection  compared to \nthe national rate of 0.2%: Cam Thuy town\u2019s is 1.2%, Ba Thuoc district\u2019s is 1.08%, and Ha Trung \ndistrict\u2019s  is  0.4%.  Improved  infrastructure  development  (road  and  hydropower  plant)  and \nincreased migrants have contributed to the high prevalence rate. To address the risk of higher \nrates  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  and  the  trafficking  of  women  and  children  resulting  from  the \nsudden  influx  of  construction  workers,  the  project  will  implement  an  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and \nanti-trafficking  program  targeting  80%  of  the  construction  workforce  and  the  affected \ncommunities  using  an  ethnic  minority-friendly  approach,  as  the  majority  of  the  targeted \ncommunities are from ethnic groups. \n \n32.\n \nThe  improved  road  connection,  combined  with  community  users\u2019  limited  adherence  of \ntraffic regulations, may cause more road accidents. Thus, the project will use community elders \nand  women  as  facilitators  in  a  community-based  road  safety  awareness  program  focusing  on \nethnic groups and vulnerable groups. \n \nE. \n \n33.\n \nThe  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  classified  as  category  A  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  B  for  environment,  and  B  for  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n34.\n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  About  1,500  households  will  be \naffected.  Of  these,  an  estimated  76  households  will  be  required  to  relocate,  while  105 \nhouseholds  may  lose  a  significant  amount  of  paddy  land  due  to  the  proposed  flyover  in  Ha \nTrung  district  and  the  proposed  realignment  in  Cam  Thuy  town  and  Ba  Thuoc  district.  The \nethnic groups found in the project areas are Dao, Kinh, Mong, Muong, and Thai. Project impacts \nwith respect to ethnic minorities are mostly related to land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \nAn REMDP has been prepared based on the preliminary design of the project road sections to \naddress potential impacts and risks, and it will be updated following completion of the detailed \ndesign.  The  eligibility  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  ADB  financing  was  determined \nthrough a due diligence assessment and it was concluded that all requirement had been met in \nterms  of    (i)  the  expected  productive  nature  of  land  to  be  acquired,  (ii)  the  suitability  of  land \nmarket conditions, (iii) the adequacy of administrative arrangements to promote the transparent \nand efficient transfer of funds, (iv) the risk profile of the transaction, and (v) the soundness of the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements. 13  The  capacity  of  staff  involved  in  resettlement \nupdating,  implementation,  and  monitoring  will  continue  to  be  strengthened  by  providing  the \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n13 Due  Diligence  for  Use  of  Loan  Funds  for  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\fnecessary  safeguards  training  during  project  implementation.  The  project  will  engage  an \nexternal  monitoring  agency  to monitor  social  safeguards activities and report  on a semiannual \nbasis to PMU1 and ADB. All social monitoring reports will be uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n35.\n \nThe AFLAR, in its capacity as the implementing agency for REMDP, will monitor (i) the \nuse  of  loan  funds  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  by  the  project  districts,  and  (ii)  the \nliquidation of any amount paid from subaccounts in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n \n36.\n \nEnvironment. Potential environmental impacts could be more manageable because the \nproject  area  has  a  relatively  flat  terrain  unlike  the  ongoing  project  which  is  situated  in  a \nmountainous area. This makes it easier to find suitable spoils disposal sites while reducing the \nrequirements  for  slope  protection  and  stabilization.  The  adverse  environmental  impacts  will \ncome largely during construction from dust and noise, surface runoff, erosion, traffic and utility \ndisruptions,  potential  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks,  and  disposal  of \nexcavated  materials.  An  EMP  detailing  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  was \nprepared  as  part  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  to  avoid  or  reduce  anticipated \nnegative impacts. The EMP also requires each contractor to prepare a  CEMP that will include \nthe following subplans on: (i) waste management and spoil disposal; (ii) materials management; \n(iii) drainage management; (iv) erosion control; (v) temporary transport management; (vi) utilities \nand irrigation reprovisioning; (vii) noise and dust control; and (viii) worker and public safety. To \nensure that project execution complies with the EMP, it will be included in the tender documents \nand  civil  works  contracts.  Each  contractor  will  be  required  to  submit  its  CEMP  before  work \nbegins at the sites. \n \n37.\n \nDuring  updating  of  the  IEE  in  January  2015,  public  consultations  began  with \nstakeholders,  such  as  local  residents,  road  users,  roadside  business  owners,  locally  elected \nrepresentatives, and local government officials; the consultations will continue until the project\u2019s \ndetailed design has been finalized. The issues and concerns raised by these stakeholders have \nbeen  addressed  in  the  IEE  and  EMP.  The  executing  agency  and  PMU1  will  be  assisted  by \nCSCs in monitoring the environmental performance of contractors, and will submit semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports to ADB, which will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The CSCs \nwill  also  conduct  capacity-building  activities  with  PMU1  on  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring, including workshops, orientations, and on-the-job training. \n \n38.\n \nADB\u2019s preliminary screening identified the project as medium risk for climate change. A \nseparate climate change risk assessment undertaken by the government identified project areas \nthat  are  vulnerable  to  climate  change.14 Increased  rainfall  and  higher  temperatures  in  these \nareas  could  affect  soil  moisture  dynamics  and  cause flooding,  hence,  climate  change-resilient \nmeasures,  including  side  drainages,  slope  stabilization,  and  road  realignment  to  avoid  flood-\nprone areas, have been considered. \n \nF. \n \n39.\n  Major  risks  identified  at  appraisal  of  the  current  project  included  the  following:  \n(i)  safeguard  policies  not  implemented  adequately,  (ii)  premature  damage  to  the  project  road \nfrom  overloaded  vehicles,  (iii)  project  roads  not  maintained  adequately,  and  (iv)  corruption. \nSince  the  ADB  loan,  under  the  project,  will  finance  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the \nfollowing additional risks are considered: (i) distortions to the land market as an efficient means \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n14 Climate Change Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nof  acquiring  land,  (ii)  misuse  of  loan  proceeds  intended  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nand (iii) inappropriate monitoring and evaluation of use of ADB loan funds. \n \n40. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  of  the  project  is  medium.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts  of  the  project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  and  thus  the  project  will  have  a \npositive impact. To mitigate all the risks in para. 39, the project will (i) engage an international \nenvironmental consultant to help support (a) the full implementation of mitigating measures, and \n(b)  the  inclusion  in  CEMPs  of  the  location  and  description  of  proposed  soil  disposal  sites  and \nbatching  plants,  and  the  various  submanagement  plans  on  unsuitable  soils  and  waste \nmanagement,  air  quality  and  noise,  water  quality,  traffic  management,  and  public  and  worker \nsafety;  and  (ii) contribute to controlling  the  overloading  and  budgeting  of  annual  provisions for \nroad maintenance. Specific to the risks related to the use of loan funds for land acquisition and \nresettlement  (para.  39),  the  following  related  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified:  (i)  the \nproject  will  engage  a qualified  and certified  appraiser  to  conduct  the  replacement  cost  survey; \n(ii)  the  affected  persons  will  be  fully  informed  about  market  conditions,  prevailing  land  values, \nand  their  right  to  have  access  to  the  project\u2019s  grievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM);  (iii)  an \naccountant in PMU1 will be responsible for administering and monitoring the use of loan funds; \n(iv)  administrative  procedures  and  a  list  of  supporting  documents  required  by  ADB  and  the \ngovernment were discussed during the workshop on \u201cUse of Loan Funds for Resettlement\u201d held \nin September 2015; (v) the GRMs that have been established in Cam Thuy and Ba Thuoc will \nbe strengthened (a GRM in Ha Trung has yet to be established); and (v) the project will engage \nan external monitoring agency to carry out its own monitoring and assessment. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n41. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n42. \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n43. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR50,440,000.00  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the \nadditional  financing  of  the  Second  Northern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport  Network \nImprovement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof  2.0%  per  annum  during  the grace period  and  thereafter, for  a term  of  25  years,  including a \ngrade period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n26 October 2015 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with:a \n \nCurrent project \nIncreased international trade on the GMS Northeastern Corridor. \nOverall project \nUnchanged. \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n \nCurrent project \nEfficient transport \nacross the Lao PDR\u2013\nViet Nam border and \non the project road \nsections of the GMS \nNortheastern Corridor \n\nRisks \n\n \n \n \nOverloaded vehicles \ndamage the project \nroad sections \n(unchanged) \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n \nMOT and MPWT \ntraffic statistics \n\n \nSurvey reports by \nproject supervision \nconsultants \n\nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\n \n \n\n \nMonitoring reports by \nFrontier military \nstation at Na Meo, \nViet Nam \n\n \nSurvey reports by \nCSC \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and \nBaselines \n\n \n \nCurrent project \nTruck traffic across the \nborder increases from 100 \ntrucks per day in 2009 to \n220 trucks per day in June \n2016 \n \nTravel time on project road \nsections decreases (hours) \nby June 2016 \na.
