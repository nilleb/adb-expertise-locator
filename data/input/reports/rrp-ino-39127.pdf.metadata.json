It \nwill  help  restore  essential  public  services,  rebuild  infrastructure,  and \nrevive  economic  activity  through  livelihood  support.  The  ETESP  is \nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  joint  damage  and  loss  assessment,  and \nthe  emerging  disaster  management,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction \n(DMRR)  strategy  for  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra,  jointly  prepared  by  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  and  the  donor  community,  with  active \nparticipation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consultations with \ncommunities and nongovernment organizations have been undertaken, \nand will be  intensified  in  the  process  of  formulating  and  implementing \nsubprojects  under  the  ETESP.  In  view  of  the  scale,  complexity,  and \nnature  of  the  disaster,  the  ETESP  adopts  a  two-phase  approach, \nfocusing  first  on  providing  development  support  to  less-affected \nregions,  along  with  launching  assessments  in  the  most-affected \nregions.  Phase two involves subproject implementation after the spatial \nplanning  and  safeguard \nissues  are  resolved.  The  ETESP  will \ncomplement emergency assistance work launched by ADB  through the \nreprogramming  of  11  ongoing  projects  and  adding  an  Aceh-North \nSumatra  component  to  the  proposed  Community  Water  Services  and \nHealth Project.  \n \nAmong  the  affected  countries,  the  impact  of  the  December  2004 \nearthquake and tsunami was the most vicious in Indonesia, as evident \nfrom  the  loss  of  126,000  lives,  94,470  people  missing,  and  412,438 \ninternally  displaced.  About  20%  of  the  population  of  Aceh  province is \n\n \nRationale \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\nto \n\nsystems, \n\nhomeless  today.    In  North  Sumatra,  the  death  toll  was  about  215.   \nAbout  20%  of  the  area  of  Nias  Islands  was  damaged.  Besides  the \ngrave tragedy and trauma, the disaster resulted in complete destruction \nof most infrastructure along the coastlines, leading to a total collapse of \npublic  services,  major  loss  of  private  property,  and  virtual  loss  of \nlivelihood.  \n \nIn  the  inland,  the  earthquake  caused  substantive  damage  to  buildings \nand  infrastructure.  The  tsunami  swept  debris  and  seawater  up  to  5 \nkilometers  inland,  crushing  and  damaging  buildings,  roads,  bridges, \ntelecommunications,  water  and  electricity \nfisheries \ninfrastructure,  crops,  fuel  outlets,  and  food  warehouses.  Those  who \nsurvived the disaster suffer from tremendous trauma because of loss of \nfamilies and relatives, as well as loss of livelihood and access to basic \nshelter  and  services.  The  internally  displaced  people,  who  have \nrelocated to other communities or temporary camps and shelters, have \nthe  already  poor  and \nbrought  on  challenges  and  distress \noverstretched  community  and  public  services.  Most  of  the  public \ninfrastructure  along  the  western  coast  must  be  rehabilitated  or  rebuilt, \nwhile  the  human  and  social  dimensions  of  the  disaster  call  for \nconcerted  efforts  to  revive  lives  and  livelihoods,  and  resurrect  entire \ncommunities. \n \nThe  provincial  and  local  governments,  which  had  already  low  budgets \nand  weak  delivery  capacity  due  to  years  of  civil  conflict,  have  lost \noffices and staff. Restoring normalcy is key to helping people get over \ntheir  trauma,  but  the  cost  and  challenges  of  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction are phenomenal. The damages and losses, estimated at \n$4.7 billion, are the largest requirement among the affected regions in \nAsia. During the development partner meeting in January 2005,  donors \npledged $1.7 billion to meet part of these requirements. ADB\u2019s support \nwill help meet the immediate requirements based on the  joint damage \nand loss assessment and the DMRR strategy. \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  ETESP  is  to  help  rebuild  the  affected  regions \nand support their economic revival to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals.  Its  purpose  is  to  (i)  facilitate  economic  revival  in  the  affected \nregions by restoring livelihoods; and (ii) alleviate constraints due to the \nlack of adequate public goods and facilities by restoring essential public \nservices and rebuilding infrastructure. \n \nTo  meet  the  critical  DMRR  needs  in  a  flexible  manner,  the  ETESP  is \ndesigned  as  a  multisector  project  facility  that  follows  the  sector  loan \napproach. It consists of five principal sector groupings: \n \n\nLivelihood  restoration.  Rehabilitate  the  agriculture  and \nfisheries  sectors,  the  mainstay  of  a  majority  of  the \nAcehnese, and revive micro and small enterprises. \n\nSocial  services  provision.  Rehabilitate  and  reconstruct \nfacilities,  and  support  skills \nhealth  and  education \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f \nCost Estimates  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\niii \n\ndevelopment of the affected population through vocational \ntraining. \n\nCommunity infrastructure.  Provide  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities,  rebuild  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  rehabilitate \nand reconstruct the damaged and lost housing stock within \nan integrated community development framework. \n\nPhysical infrastructure. Rebuild the damaged roads and \nbridges,  restore  power  supply,  support  sound  spatial \nplanning,  and  strengthen  environmental  management \nsystems. \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nFiduciary  governance.  Ensure  sound  oversight  of  the \nutilization  of  donor  funds  in  the  DMRR  process,  and \nfacilitate effective delivery of ETESP assistance. \n\n \nThe total cost of the ETESP is estimated at $321.5 million equivalent.  \n \nA grant of $290.0 million from the Asian Tsunami Fund resources of the \nthe \nADB  will  be  provided  to  finance  the  ETESP.  In  addition, \nNetherlands  Government  will  provide  $3.5  million  for  the  fiduciary \noversight  support  component  of  the  ETESP.  The  Government  of \nIndonesia  will  finance  the  remaining  $28.0  million  equivalent  of  the \ncosts covering local taxes and other regular administrative costs.  \n \n30 June 2008 \n\nis \n\nestablishing \n\n \nThe  Government \nan  Aceh  Reconstruction \nImplementation Coordination Board (BKP) to coordinate and implement \nDMRR. BKP  will  provide  an  interface  between  the  central  and  local \ngovernments and ensure effective involvement of the Acehnese people. \nBKP  will  comprise  a  steering  board,  supervisory  board,  and  an \nimplementation  coordination  board.  The  steering  board  will  include \nselected  ministers,  the  governor  of  Aceh,  the  governor  of  north \nSumatra,  heads  of  affected  districts,  academics,  community \nrepresentatives  and  religious  leaders.  It  will  provide  inputs  and \nrecommendations in formulating, planning and implementing the DMRR \nprocess,  and  submit  reports  to  the  President  of  Indonesia  once  every \nfour  months.  The  supervisory  board  will  comprise  representatives  of \ncivil  society, \nlocal  media,  nongovernment \norganizations, and donors (bilateral and multilateral).  It will oversee the \nactivities  of  the  BKP,  receive  and  follow  up  on  complaints  from  the \npublic,  and  coordinate  independent  audits  on  the  functioning  of  the \nBKP.  The  implementation  board,  comprising  the  head  of  BKP,  its \nsecretary,  and  deputies  of  BKP\u2019s  operational  departments,  will \nformulate  operational  policies,  implement  projects  in  coordination  with \nother  relevant  Government  institutions,  and  ensure  overall  sound \nfiduciary governance in the utilization of  donor support and other public \nfunds in the DMRR process. \n\nlocal  universities, \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\nOnce established, the BKP will be the Executing Agency. In the interim, \nBAPPENAS  will  function  as  the  Executing  Agency  and  once  BKP  is \nestablished the role and responsibilities of the Executing Agency will be \ntransferred  from  BAPPENAS  to  BKP.  BKP  will  be  responsible  for \nits \noverall  management  and  coordination  of  ETESP  and \nimplementation,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  line  ministries.  For the \nday-to-day  project  management,  a  dedicated,  centralized  project \nmanagement  office  will  be  established  within  BKP,  with  staffing  and \nother support provided by the ETESP. The project management office \nwill  review  and  appraise  subprojects  for  BKP\u2019s  consideration,  and \nensure  overall  governance  and  fiduciary  controls  on  the  utilization  of \nETESP funds. The design of subprojects and their implementation will \nbe  under  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  line  ministries,  in \ncollaboration with local governments.  \n \nThe  Extended  Mission  of  Sumatra,  being  established  by  ADB,  will  be \nresponsible for managing, administering, and implementing the ETESP. \nLocated  in  Medan  with  an  office  in  Banda  Aceh,  the  Mission will work \nclosely  with  BKP;  project  management  office;  and  the  central, \nprovincial,  and  local  governments  to  structure  and  implement  the \nsubprojects. \n \nAceh-North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Implementation \nCoordination  Board \nImplementation \nArrangements) \n \nGiven  the  emergency  DMRR  needs,  procurement of goods, services, \nand works will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified \nand  expedient  procedures  permitted  under  the  ADB  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy and ADB Guidelines for Procurement, in \ngeneral.  ADB  procedures  for  providing  reconstruction  assistance  after \ndisasters  allow  maximum  flexibility,  so  that  project  activities  can  start \npromptly.  National  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  civil \nworks  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation  period,  the \ngenerally  small  size  of  contract  packages,  and  the  wide  geographic \nspread of the project sites. Community participation  in procurement will \nbe  encouraged,  and  local  goods  and  services  will  be  given  priority  to \nencourage economic revival in the affected regions. \n \n\n(see  notes  under \n\n(BKP) \n\n \nConsulting Services  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment,  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Simplified  consultant  selection \nprocedures,  including  direct  selection  and  shorter  evaluation  periods, \nwill be followed in line with the flexibility provided under ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand Emergency Assistance Policy. \n \nThe Government is coordinating the establishment of a multidonor trust \nfund  (MDTF),  which  is  expected  to  attract  contributions  of  several \ndonors.    MDTF  is  a  vehicle  to  pool  bilateral  resources  in  order  to \nchannel  these  through  the  budget  to  ensure  a  systematic  and \n\n \nMultidonor Trust \nFund \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ncoordinated  approach  to  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the \naffected regions. It is proposed that ADB contribute $10 million from the \nAsian Tsunami Fund to the MDTF to facilitate coordination between the \nETESP and support from the other donors through the MDTF. \n \nThe people of Aceh and North Sumatra affected by the earthquake and \ntsunami disaster \n \nETESP  implementation  involves  three  major  risks:  (i)  the  history  of \nprolonged  conflicts  in  Aceh;  (ii)  lack  of  adequate  capacity  at  the  local \ngovernment levels in the devastated regions; and (iii) lack of coherence \nin  the  implementation  of  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  lack  of \ndonor  coordination.  The  ETESP  design  aims  to  mitigate  these risks. \nThe tsunami tragedy has provided a small window of opportunity for the \nGovernment  and  the  Free  Aceh  Movement  to  discuss  Aceh\u2019s future. \nPeace  talks  have  been  initiated  in  Helsinki  and  the  Free  Aceh \nMovement.  As  an  interim  measure,  the  Free  Aceh  Movement  and  the \nGovernment have agreed to  a temporary cease fire. Another important \nmitigating  factor  is  the  level  of  seriousness  and  commitment  the \nGovernment  has  shown  in  preparing  the  DMRR  strategy,  and  in \nmobilizing  donor  commitments.  ETESP  design  deals  with  the  conflict \nrisk  by  recognizing  that  the  reconstruction  effort  needs  to  be  fully \nparticipatory.  \n \nWith regard to capacity constraints, the ETESP recognizes the serious \nlocal  problems  to  be  faced.  This  capacity  risk  will  be  mitigated  by \nincluding  capacity-building  support  for  local  governments in all sector \nand  subproject  interventions,  and  providing  adequate  support  for \nproject management and implementation.  \n \nThe  ETESP\u2019s  flexible  design  will  help  mitigate  coordination  risks  by \nformulating sector  interventions under two phases. This is to allow for \nadequate  time  and  consultations  with  central  and  local  governments \nand  donors.  The  subproject  proposals  will  pass \nthrough  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  process,  including  in-depth  consultations \nwith all relevant and major institutions concerned. \n\nIn addition, the segregation of women and persistence of gender-based \ndiscriminatory  practices  in  Aceh  may  affect  the  ETESP\u2019s  ability  to \nidentify specific needs and vulnerabilities of women, especially widows \nand  female  heads  of  households,  in  order  to  formulate  adequate \nresponse.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  ETESP  components  will  support \ncommunity  organizations,  including  women\u2019s  grassroots  organizations \nand networks, to participate in local decision-making to ensure that their \nrehabilitation  and \nperspectives  are \nreconstruction efforts. \n\nin  mainstream \n\nincluded \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant  to  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Emergency  Support  Project \n(ETESP); (ii) proposed administration of a grant from the Government of the Netherlands for the \nETESP; and (iii) a contribution to the Multidonor Trust Fund (MDTF).  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nThe 26 December 2004 Tsunami \n\n2. \nTsunamis  have  been  recorded  for  several  centuries,  though  the  frequency  of  their \noccurrence  in  the  Indian  Ocean  is  low  relative  to  the  Pacific where over  300  tsunamis  have \nbeen  recorded.  While  Sumatra\u2019s  west  coast  has  experienced  tidal  waves,  the  event  of  26 \nDecember 2004  was  the  worst  in  recent  history.  The  earthquake  that  triggered  the  tsunami \noccurred  at  7:58  am  local  time  (1:58  pm  Greenwich mean time), with its epicenter about 250 \nkilometers  (km)  from  Banda  Aceh,  the  capital  of  Aceh  province,  and  about  150  km  south  of \nMeulaboh, off the coast of Sumatra. Originating at a relatively shallow depth of 30 km below the \nIndian  Ocean,  the  earthquake  was  recorded  at  9.0  on  the  Richter  scale,  making  it  the  fifth \nlargest  in  recorded  history,  and  the  worst  natural  disaster  since  the  eruption  of  Krakatoa  in \nIndonesia in 1883, in terms of energy released.  \n \n3. \nThe  United  States  Geological  Survey  estimates  that  up  to  1,200  km  of  the  India  Plate \nboundary  has  likely  slipped  as  a  result  of  the  powerful  quake.  It  caused  an  initial  rupture  of \nabout  100  km  wide,  and  an  estimated  vertical  displacement  of  15  meters  along  the  fault  line. \nThe  tsunami  triggered  by  the  massive  displacement  on  the  seafloor  caused  unprecedented \ndamage  in  Aceh  province  in  northern  Sumatra  (Maps).  Fourteen  of  21  districts  (kabupaten), \nprimarily  in  the  coastal  areas  of  the  province,  were  significantly  damaged,  while  interior  areas \nsuffered serious earthquake damage. The tsunami devastated coastal areas in India, Maldives, \nSri Lanka, Thailand, and to some extent in  Bangladesh and Myanmar. Its impact was felt as far \nwest as Africa. \n \nAs of 5 March 2005, the Government of Indonesia (the Government) reported 126,000 \n4. \ndead, 94,470 missing, and 412,438 internally displaced. In Aceh  province, with a population of \n3.9  million,  over  10%  were  left  homeless.  In  North  Sumatra,  the  death  toll  was  over  200  and \nabout  20%  of  the  area  of  Nias  Islands  was  damaged.  The  disaster  has  totally  devastated \nlivelihoods and  damaged  private  and  public  property. Public infrastructure collapsed along the \ncoastal lines, and inland destruction was significant due to the earthquake. The tsunami swept \ndebris  and  seawater  up  to  5  km  inland,  crushing  and  damaging  buildings,  roads,  bridges, \ntelecommunications,  water  and  electricity  systems,  fisheries infrastructure, crops, fuel outlets, \nand food warehouses. To restore normalcy, infrastructure must be rehabilitated or rebuilt along \nthe west coast, while the human and social dimensions of the disaster call for concerted efforts \nto revive lives and livelihoods and resurrect entire communities.  \n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Response and the Damage and Loss Assessment \n\n5. \nThe  Government  swiftly  responded  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  disaster.  Its \nemergency, rescue, and relief efforts were coordinated by the National Coordination Board for \nDisaster  Management  under  the  Vice  President\u2019s  Office  and  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for \n\n\f 2\n\nPeople\u2019s  Welfare.  The  National  Coordination  Board  was  assigned  overall  responsibility  for \nrecovering  and  burying  the  dead;  placing  the  survivors  in  shelters;  distributing  water,  food, \nblankets, and essential medicines; and  undertaking emergency removal and disposal of debris. \nAs Aceh was still under a state of civil emergency under  the central Government\u2019s jurisdiction, \nthe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  sent  in  staff  to  run  the  local  administration  and  manage  public \nservice  responsibilities  of  the  devastated  districts  and  villages.  The  United  Nations  (UN) \nsupported  the  relief  and  humanitarian  assistance.  Bilateral  institutions  and  armed  forces  of \nseveral countries also played an important role in the initial emergency and relief efforts.  \n \n6. \nThe scale of the tragedy and the tremendous loss of human lives have led to a massive \nmobilization  of  emergency  support  and  commitments  from  the  world  community  for  future \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  In  order  to  effectively  coordinate  the  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  process  and  channel  domestic  and  international  assistance,  in  early  January \n2005,  the  President  of  Indonesia  tasked  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  with  the  formulation  of  a  medium-term  disaster  management,  rehabilitation, and \nreconstruction (DMR R) strategy, to be completed by end-March 2005. On 26 March 2005, Vice \nPresident  unveiled  a  12-volume  DMRR  blueprint  for  Aceh  reconstruction  in  Banda  Aceh,  for \npublic  consultation.  A  Presidential  Decree  on  the  establishment  of  a  new  Implementation \nCoordination  Board  for  Aceh-North Sumatra  Rehabilitation and Reconstruction  (BKP) , which \nwill be tasked with the implementation of the the DMRR blueprint, is anticipated in April 2005.   \n \n7. \nDamage and Loss Assessment. The earthquake and tsunami destroyed large parts of \nBanda Aceh; the nearby districts of Aceh Besar and Aceh Jaya; Meulaboh, the capital of West \nAceh and Lhokseumawe in North Aceh. Coastal areas of other districts were also affected, but \nwith  less  severity,  including  East  Aceh,  Nagan  Raya,  Simeuleue,  South  Aceh,  Pidie,  and \nBireuen. To estimate the material impact of the disaster, the Government,  with coordination by \nBAPPENAS,  and  donors  jointly  undertook  a  comprehensive  damage  and  loss  assessment \n(DLA).  The  DLA  exercise,1  which  covered  15  sectors,  focused  on  the  damage  to  public  and \nprivate infrastructure  (stock)  and  on  the  loss  of  income  (flow) stemming from the widespread \ndestruction of productive assets and the environment.  \n \n8. \nOverall damage and losses, as estimated on a replacement basis by the joint DLA team, \namount  to  about  $4.7  billion,  representing  2.3%  of  the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nand about 115% of the annual regional GDP of Aceh province. Of this, 37% of the damage was \nincurred in the social sectors (including housing, education, and health); 25% in the productive \nsectors  (including  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  industry  and  trade);  19%  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors (including energy, transport, communications, water and sanitation, irrigation, and flood \ncontrol);  and  19%  in  the  environment,  governance,  and  financial  sectors.  Damage to personal \nproperty,  particularly  housing,  has  been  pervasive.  Reconstruction  and  restoration  of  lost \nhousing stock alone will require $1.4 billion. Reconstruction needs may be significantly different \nand  costs  considerably  higher  if  the  Government  and  Acehnese  residents  decide  to  rebuild \ncommunities in different locations or to provide better public facilities and services than before. \nTable 1 presents a summary of the DLA on a sector basis. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   BAPPENAS and the International Donor Community. 2005.

Indonesia: Preliminary \nDamage  and  Loss  Assessment,  A  Technical  Report  of  BAPPENAS  and  International  Donor \nCommunity, Jakarta, January. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSecessionist Conflict. Over the past 2 decades, the civilian and secessionist conflict in \n9. \nAceh  has  claimed  the  lives  of  about  10,000  people.  After  several  attempts  at  allowing  civil \nadministration, the central Government again imposed martial law in May 2003; this was relaxed \nto a state of civil emergency for 6 months beginning in May 2004. Now, the central Government \nhas  declared  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  as  national  disasters  and  it  is  providing  greater \nadministration  support to  the  province.  Immediately  following  the  disaster,  Indonesia\u2019s  armed \nforces announced a cease-fire to facilitate relief efforts, which was accepted by the Free Aceh \nMovement. Subsequently, the Government has declared a temporary cease fire and engaged in \npeace talks with the Free Aceh Movement. Prospects for early resolution of issues surrounding \nthe conflict are complicated by the movement\u2019s demands for full political autonomy bordering on \nindependence.  \n \n10. \nEconomic  Context  and  Impact.    Years  of  conflict  have  eroded  the  physical \ninfrastructure and facilities and rendered it difficult to provide effectively  functioning basic social \nservices  in  Aceh.  While  general  health  and  education  indicators  in  Aceh  were  comparable  to \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4\n\nthe \n\ntragedy, \n\ninvestor  confidence.  Until \n\nnational averages, the conflict has had a disproportionate impact on social infrastructure in two \nways. First,  services  in  rural  areas  were  neglected  due  to  declining  investments  as  well  as \nsecurity  concerns  at  subdistrict  and  village  levels.  Second,  more than  900 schools have been \ndestroyed  or  severely  damaged  since  1998  as  a  result  of  the  conflict.  At  a  broader  level,  the \ninternational \nconflict  has  eroded  public  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  had  been  barred  from  operating  in  Aceh,  while \nassistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies was low because of operational difficulties. \n \nIn  2003,  Aceh\u2019s  regional  GDP  was  Rp38.6  trillion  ($4.1  billion),  accounting  for  a  little \n11. \nover 2% of national GDP. Real GDP grew at 3.4% in 2003, relative to the national GDP growth \nrate of 4.3%. On a sector basis, oil and gas had the largest share of GDP at 43%, followed by \nagriculture at 32%. Almost half of Aceh\u2019s labor force of 2.3 million is employed in the agriculture \nsector.  Given  its  special  status  and  abundant  resources,  Aceh  receives  a  greater  share  of \nrevenues  from  its  natural  resources  (primarily  oil  and  gas),  since  the  introduction  of \ndecentralization in 1999, relative to other provinces. For instance, until 2009 Aceh is to receive \n70% of the oil revenues generated, while other provinces receive only 15% (with the exception \nof Papua), and the ratios are 40% and 30%, respectively, for gas revenues.  \n \n12. \nGiven the scale of the disaster and the significant loss of private productive assets, the \nmacroeconomic impact of the disaster  is likely to range from a 0.1 to 0.5 percentage point drop \nin  the  national  GDP  growth  rate  of  5.5%  projected  for  2005.  Yet,  if  the  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction activities gain momentum with replacement private and public investments made, \nthe negative impact may be contained. \n \nSocial and Poverty Impact. Based on a field survey, the Central Statistical Agency has \n13. \ndetermined  that  660  Acehnese  villages,  including  outskirts  of  urban  areas,  with  a  combined \npopulation of 650,000 were affected. The disaster struck a sizable proportion of the economy, \nparticularly  major  market  and  service  centers  such  as  Bandah  Aceh,  Calang, and  Meulaboh, \nwhich  bore  the  brunt  of  the  impact.  It  struck  individuals,  households,  communities,  social \norganizations,  and  economic  chains.  Acehnese  communities  are  cohesive, and  people  live in \nconcentrated  areas.  The  community  is  the  repository  of information about resources, assets, \nownership,  and  identity.  Community  social  institutions  responsible  for  organizing  social  and \npersonal  lives  and  mitigating  conflict  have  suffered  losses  and  incapacitation  of  key  persons. \nThis increases the probability of community tensions aggravated further by the sudden influx of \ninternally  displaced  people.  The  multiple  role  of  women\u2014heading  households;  sustaining \nsubsistence  economies;  raising  children;  and  caring  for  the  sick,  elderly,  and  wounded\u2014has \ncome to form the lifeline of Acehnese communities. In the rebuilding phase, emphasis needs to \nbe placed on restoring and securing women\u2019s livelihoods and supporting women\u2019s groups and \nnetworks whose survival strategies are holding communities together. Such support will be vital \nto  rapidly  and  holistically  advancing  emotional,  social,  and  economic  recovery  in  the  tsunami-\naffected areas. \n \n14. \nDespite the conflict, the province  kept pace with the rest of Indonesia in general terms. \nFurthermore, as Aceh was outside of the El Nino belt that afflicted much of Indonesia in 1997 \nand  1998,  its  agriculture-based  economy  with  little  manufacturing  or  trade  and  relatively  small \nexposure to the financial system isolated it from most of the impacts of the crises of those years. \nThe  incidence  of  poverty  in  Aceh  remained  lower  than  the  national  average  until  2001. \nSubsequently,  however,  the  trend  reversed,  and  in  2003  Aceh  ranked  as  the  third  poorest \nprovince after Papua and Maluku, most likely stemming from the conflict. The disaster is likely to \naffect  the  poor  disproportionately,  by  cutting  access  to  essential  public  services.  Thus \n\n\fEnvironmental \n\nImpact.  The  earthquake  and \n\ncompensation  and  asset  restoration  must  be  well  targeted  to  ensure  that  the  needy  receive \nsuch support. \n \n15. \ntsunami  have  caused  serious \nenvironmental  damage,  estimated  at  above  $660  million  (Table  1,  note).  About  one  fourth is \nattributable to direct destruction of environmental assets, while the remaining corresponds to the \nloss  of  benefits  from  environmental assets such as coral reefs and forests, which will need at \nleast  a  generation  to  regenerate.  The  geography  of  the  affected  regions  is  characterized  by  a \nmountain  ridge  running  from  the  west  to  the  southeast.  The  coastal  plains  are  developed, \nexcept along most of the western coast. The regions have a diverse range of ecosystems and \nfoliage,  including  coral  reefs,  mangroves, and  different types of  forests.  On  the  approximately \n100,000 hectares (ha) of coastal reefs in the affected regions, about 30% have  live coral. The \nprovince  also  has  rich  water  resources,  including  rivers,  lakes,  wetlands,  and  groundwater \nsystems.  The  disaster  had  an  enormous  impact  on  the  environment  in  general,  inflicting \ndamage  on  ecosystems,  plants  and  habitats,  and  animals.  Two  particular  issues  are \nnoteworthy. The disaster generated vast quantities of debris and spread sewage and industrial \nwaste  and  damaged the  ecosystem.  It  also  appears  to  have  altered  coastal  lines,  as well as \naffecting land surface and soil quality. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Strategy \n\nBAPPENAS  and  the  development  partners  have  formulated  the  DMRR  strategy2 for \n16. \nrestoration of normal life in Aceh and North Sumatra. The strategy distinguishes between three \npartly  overlapping  phases:  immediate  emergency  and  relief  operations  to be completed within \nthe  first  6  months  (by  June  2005);  the  rehabilitation  phase,  which  will  cover  0.5\u20132 years; and \nreconstruction activities to be initiated along with rehabilitation and carried out over 5 years. The \nstrategy focuses on:  \n\n \n\n\u2022  Restoring  Lives  and  Livelihoods. The Government aims to (i) design and implement \nlabor-intensive public works in the short term, (ii) provide the  opportunity for families to \nrebuild their own homes, (iii) support families and communities where displaced people \nhave taken refuge, (iv) provide compensation from budgetary resources in a transparent \nmanner,  and  (v)  rebuild  land  registration  offices  and  formulate  effective  dispute \nresolution procedures. \n \n\n\u2022  Restoring  Economic  Activity.  The  Government  will  (i)  emphasize  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure  investments,  and  purchase  all  goods  and  services  locally  to  the  extent \npossible;  (ii)  recapitalize  household  and  small  enterprises  with  grants;  (iii)  restore \nbanking  and  essential  financial  services  quickly;  (iv)  minimize  local  and  international \ntrade  barriers  to  control  price  hikes;  and  (v)  reestablish  retail  and  wholesale  markets, \nincluding information centers. \n\n\u2022  Restoring  Infrastructure.  The  Government  aims  to  (i)  rebuild  strategic  roads  and \nbridges  quickly,  and  realign  some  roads  as  needed  as  part  of  the  spatial  planning \nprocess;  (ii)  rebuild  air  and  seaports;  (iii)  repair  power  and  telecommunication \ninfrastructure;  and  (iv)  restore  clean  water  supply,  through  temporary  measures  to \nprovide water, and cleaning, desalination, and redigging of wells. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   BAPPENAS and the International Donor Community. 2005.  Indonesia: Notes on Reconstruction  \u2013 the December \n\n26, 2004 Natural Disaster. Jakarta. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f 6\n\n\u2022  Restoring  Government  and  Civil  Institutions.  The  Government  aims  to  (i)  rebuild \nlocal  administrations  and  restore  functional  responsibility  as  quickly  as  possible;  (ii) \nstrengthen administrative arrangements and ensure transparency; (iii) establish systems \nto  ensure  sound  delivery  of  essential  public  services,  particularly  to  the  vulnerable \nsegments of the population; and (iv) support and facilitate the redesigning of cities and \nplaces of economic activity, and \n \n\n\u2022  Strengthening  Governance  for  Managing  Recovery.  To  effectively  manage  the \nrecovery process, the Government is emphasizing the need for (i) channeling as much \ndonor  support  as  possible  through  the  budget  and  minimizing  off-budget mechanisms, \nprimarily  to  ensure  sound  coordination  of  development  assistance;  (ii)  maximizing  the \nuse  of  grant  financing  followed  by  soft  loans;  (iii)  developing  effective  governance \nstructures;  and  (iv)  phasing  out  central  Government  support  as  the  affected  regional \ngovernments in Aceh and North Sumatra recover their lost capacities. \n \n17. \nThe Government has adopted certain core principles to guide DMRR, including (a) using \nparticipatory  decision-making  by  empowering  the  people  of  Aceh;  (b)  ensuring  sound \ncoordination,  for  consistency  and  effectiveness  across  sectors  and  regions;  (c)  utilizing  a \ncomprehensive  approach  to  rebuilding  communities,  based  on  in-depth  spatial  planning  and \nlocation analyses; (d) distinguishing between rehabilitation (to achieve minimum standards) and \nreconstruction  (to  enable  Acehnese  to  move  forward);  (e)  restoring  human  resource  capacity \nacross all sectors, and focusing on delivery of services and strengthening institutions rather than \non projects; and (f) ensuring full fiscal transparency and effective monitoring.  \n \n \n\nDevelopment Partners\u2019 Response  \n\n3. \n\n18. \nThe response from the international community has been swift. Army, air force, and navy \nunits  from  several  countries  supported  the  rescue  and  relief  operations  in  the  immediate \naftermath  of  the  disaster,  working  alongside  various  UN  agencies.  The  6  January  2005  Asian \nTsunami  Summit  held  in  Jakarta  led  to  an  outpouring  of  support  from  the  international \ncommunity. Many development partners worked collectively with the Government to prepare the \nDLA  and  the  DMRR  strategy.  The  subsequent  UN  Flash  Appeal  resulted  in  a  contribution  of \nclose  to  $370  million  for  Indonesia.  At  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  meeting  held  in \nJanuary  2005,  donors  committed  $1.7  billion  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  support  in \n2005;  of  this,  $1.0  billion  is  estimated  to  be  channeled  through  the  budget.  Several  bilateral \ndonors have pledged significant contributions, including Australia (about $780 million in grants \nand soft loans), United States (about $450 million in grants), and European Union (about $265 \nmillion in grants). Other countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, and United \nKingdom  are  formulating  significant  support  initiatives.  BAPPENAS  is  coordinating  the \nestablishment of a  multidonor trust fund  (MDTF), which  is expected to  attract contributions of \nseveral  donors.    MDTF  is  seen  as  a  vehicle  largely  to  pool  bilateral  resources  in  order  to \nchannel  these  through  the  budget  to  ensure  a  systematic  and  coordinated  approach  to  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and North Sumatra (para.23, and 91-93).   \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Support and Strategy \n\n \n4. \n\n19. \nADB\u2019s Strategy and Measures Taken. ADB has had a strategic presence in Aceh and \nNorth  Sumatra  as  a  lead  donor  in  the  agriculture,  coastal  resources,  irrigation,  and  health \nsectors.  In  some  sectors,  it  has  been  the  only  major  international  agency  operating.  This \nproject-oriented experience greatly facilitated ADB\u2019s initial contribution to the DLA work.  In the \nimmediate aftermath of the tragedy, ADB established  the Aceh Reconstruction Team made up \n\n\fTo  expeditiously  mobilize  ADB  support, \n\nof 20 experts. Having expertise in almost all the sectors, the  team has worked closely with the \nGovernment and the donor community in the DLA and DMRR strategy formulation process, and \neffectively contributed to this major exercise.  \n \nthe  Government  and  ADB  signed  a \n20. \nmemorandum  of  understanding  on  5  January  2005  outlining  a  three-step  approach:  (i) \nreprogramming  ongoing  projects  in  priority  sectors  to  facilitate  support  for  immediate \nrehabilitation; (ii) expanding the scope of projects at an advanced stage of preparation and with \na design relevant to the Aceh situation, such as the proposed Community Water Services and \nHealth  Project;  and  (iii)  developing  a  new  comprehensive  multisector  emergency  assistance \nproject. \n \n21.  Major progress has been made on steps (i) and (ii).3 Reprogramming of ongoing projects \nidentified  about  $64.6  million  of  loan  savings  in  11  projects;  these  resources  are available for \nutilization  in  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra.  With  regard  to  step  (ii),  about  $16.4  million  in  grant \ncofinancing ($7.4 million from the Department for Foreign and International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom,  $5  million  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  $4  million  from  the \nCanadian International Development Agency) has been secured to rehabilitate and reconstruct \nrural water supply and sanitation systems in Aceh and Nias Islands.  The ETESP is a response \nto  step  (iii).  It  will  include  initial  cofinancing  of  $3.5  million  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands  to  support  fiduciary  oversight  of  the  flow  of  donor  funds,  and  will  be  open  to \nreceiving cofinancing for other components.  \n \n22. \nIn  addition,  five  grant  project  proposals  are  being  processed  for  consideration  by  the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for  consideration.  With  a  total  value  of  $10  million \nthey support: (i) sustainable livelihood development of coastal fishing communities in Aceh and \nNias ($2.5 million), (ii) rehabilitation of damaged mangrove and coral reef resources in Aceh and \nNias ($1.5 million), (iii) restoration of microenterprise and microfinance in Aceh ($2 million), (iv) \ncommunity social safety net initiatives in Aceh ($2 million), and (v) seismically upgraded housing \ndevelopment in Aceh ($2 million). The geographic focus of these projects will be refined during \nimplementation depending on the emerging needs. \n \nFurthermore,  ADB  has  had  intensive  discussions  with  the  Government  and  the  World \n23. \nBank, in its role as trustee for MTDF, to work out arrangements for ADB\u2019s involvement in MDTF. \nADB\u2019s  contribution  to  the  MDTF  (para.91-93)  is  aimed  at  ensuring  complementarity  and \nconformity between the ETESP and support provided by other donors through the MDTF. \n \n \n\nLessons and Principles Incorporated in ETESP Design \n\n5. \n\n24. \nThe rehabilitation and reconstruction needs are staggering. Quite different from the other \naffected countries, the rebuilding  of  Aceh is likely  to be more challenging given the state of the \npolitical economy, level of development of  the province, and relatively weak capacity to absorb \nlarge  assistance  flows  equivalent  to  about  a  quarter  of  Aceh\u2019s  GDP  every  year  for  the  next  4 \nyears. Based on these factors and ADB\u2019s past experience with emergency assistance, at least \nsix major challenges and lessons have guided ETESP design.  \n \n25. \nFirst, dealing with a natural disaster of this magnitude in a conflict environment calls for \na  sound  approach  to  rebuilding  with  participatory  mechanisms  across  the  affected  areas  in  a \ntransparent  and  accountable  manner.  Allocation  of  resources  to  different  villages  and  districts \n\n                                                 \n3   The Board information paper circulated on 15 March 2005 provides further details. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8\n\nneed to be in line with the DLA, accepting that nearly every region in the province has felt some \ndegree of stress from this calamity. Unless a conflict-sensitive approach is adopted, prospects \nof  genuine  reconciliation  through  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  are  likely  to  be  lost.  ADB\u2019s \npast  support  for  conflict-affected  communities  in  Indonesia,  for  instance  in  West  Timor, has \ndemonstrated that resources need to be distributed in a balanced and equitable manner across \ndirectly and indirectly affected communities. \n \n26. \nSecond,  the  rebuilding  process  will  take  place  in  an  environment  with  depleted  public \nadministration systems, yet one that is decentralized to the district level. The special autonomy \nprovisions  must  be  respected,  and  credibility  and  trust  developed  among  the  affected  local \nofficials  and  citizens.  As  Indonesian  decentralization  is  recent,  local  government  capacity  has \ngenerally  been  nascent  and  almost  erased  in  the  most  affected  region/districts.  Building  local \ncapacity, in an incremental manner, to implement programs is critical for ensuring  the regional \nautonomy  of  Aceh  and  the  aspirations  of  its  people.  The  local  governments  are  being  revived \nand  have  established  working  groups  parallel  to  those at the central level. Their proposals for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  be  effectively  aligned  with  broader  principles  being \nformulated  by  the  central  Government.  Sound  governance  and  fiduciary  arrangements  are \ncritical given the weak capacity, as well as the loss of historical records of population and land \ntitles. They have to be structured so that they do not impede speedy delivery.  \n \nThird, total obliteration in many areas has likely led to radical shifts in the demographic \n27. \nand social composition of communities. In coastal and many inland communities, the rebuilding \nprocess will not be initiated unless carefully considered spatial, resettlement, and environment \nassessments and plans are finalized. The Government has proposed rezoning arrangements for \ncoastal areas. This would entail the creation of a buffer zone near the coastline, a medium zone \nof  less  devastated  areas,  and  an  inland  zone  of  least  affected  areas.  In  the  most  affected \ncoastal  zones,  rebuilding  local  infrastructure  and  public  facilities  will  have  to  follow  the \nfinalization of this process and consultations with the affected communities. Resolution of land \nallocation  may  prove  to  be  one  of  the  most  complex  issues,  in  the  absence  of  community \nleadership in many cases. A consistent policy framework needs to be adopted on land retitling \nand building permits  provided  to  those  who  want  to  rebuild  in  their  original  locations.  As  the \nland-titling system was not complete before the tsunami, possession of acceptable documents \nmay  be  rare.  A  serious  challenge  is  to  develop  participatory  mechanisms  to  truly  enable  the \nAcehnese  people  to  determine  issues  such  as  those  related  to  spatial  location.  These  issues \nhave many implications and demand comprehensive support.  \n \nFourth, with close to 80% of the damage and losses suffered by the private sector, the \n28. \npublic-private  dimensions  of  the  disaster  warrant  innovative  solutions  involving  the  private \nsector. Top priority needs to be assigned to alleviating the public goods constraints by restoring \nand  rebuilding  vital  social  and  physical  infrastructure  that  is  essential  for  the  private  sector  to \nfunction.  Support  programs  for  removing  private  constraints  should  proceed  in  parallel,  and \nlivelihood opportunities need to be restored quickly to provide dignity, comfort, as well as means \nof economic survival to those affected. In particular, the transition from the relief and emergency \nphase  to  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  stage  needs  to  be  managed  well\u2014recognizing \nthat  the  line  between  relief  and  later  activities  will  vary  from  area  to  area  and  is  very  much  a \nfunction of the level of devastation incurred and local capacity. Restoration of private productive \nassets  needs  to  be  actively  pursued,  through  a  blend  of  compensation  and  targeted  support \nschemes. \n \n29. \nFifth,  the  outpouring  of  support  from  within  Indonesia  and  the  international  community \nmeans  that  coordination  of  support  is  vital.  The  Government  needs  to  outline  clear  principles \n\n\fand  practices  to  guide  the  support  from  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  public-private \npartnerships, and has to  set up  effective  mechanisms  for  donor  coordination.  The  fund  flows \nfrom donors that are channeled through the budget  as well as outside of the budget  need to be \ncarefully  monitored,  and  their  impact  evaluated  and  assessed  periodically  to  ensure  that  the \nDMRR  objectives  are  met.  Ensuring  sound  fiduciary  governance is extremely important in the \npostconflict and postdisaster environment given the weak local capacity.  \n \n30. \nSixth, deriving from all of these factors, flexibility is paramount in designing the overall \nproject  and  subprojects.  Needs  should  be  assessed  and  reassessed  as  they  emerge  during \nimplementation  of  the  overall  project,  and  components  should  be  flexible  to  accommodate \npossible reallocation of resources. Nevertheless, safeguard provisions including environmental \nprotection,  and  poverty  reduction  measures  should  be  included  in  the  design.  Adequate \nstandards  for  civil  works  should  be  maintained  during  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nprocess. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n31. \nThe overall goal of  the ETESP is to help rebuild the affected regions and support their \neconomic  revival  to  meet  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Its  purpose  is  to  (i) \nfacilitate  economic  revival  in  the  affected  regions  by  restoring  livelihoods;  and  (ii)  alleviate \nconstraints  resulting  from  the  lack  of  public  goods  and  facilities  by  restoring  essential  public \nservices and rebuilding infrastructure. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nComponents  \n\n32. \nTo  meet  the  critical  DMRR  needs  in  a  flexible  manner,  the  ETESP  is  designed as a \nmultisector  project  facility  that  follows  the  sector  loan  approach.  It  consists  of  five  principal \nsector groupings: \n \n\nLivelihood  restoration.  Rehabilitate  the  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors,  the \nmainstay of a majority of the Acehnese, and revive micro and small enterprises. \n\nSocial  service  provision.  Rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  health  and  education \nfacilities,  and  support  skills  development  of  the  affected  population  through \nvocational training. \n\nCommunity  infrastructure.  Provide  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  rebuild \nirrigation  infrastructure,  and  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  the  damaged  and  lost \nhousing stock within an integrated community development framework. \n\nPhysical  infrastructure.  Rebuild  damaged  roads  and  bridges,  restore  power \nsupply,  support  sound  spatial  planning,  and  strengthen  environmental \nmanagement systems. \n\nFiduciary  governance. Ensure  sound  oversight  of  donor  fund  utilization  in  the \nDMRR process, and facilitate effective delivery of ETESP support. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f 10\n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n33. \nFlexibility in Design and Support. With large areas heavily affected, and over 400,000 \ninternally  displaced  people  and  others  directly  or  indirectly  affected  needing  some  form  of \nlivelihood  restoration  support;  the  DMRR  process  will  be  complex  and  time-consuming. The \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy  is  expected  to  evolve  and  change  over  time  to  meet  emerging  needs. \nWith damages and losses in billions of dollars, effective coordination between the Government \nand donors, and among the latter, will be essential. DMR R support needs to be channeled in a \nsequenced  and  seamless  manner,  recognizing  that  the  relief  and  emergency  operations  are \nwinding down in many areas, and that rehabilitation activities are already under way in the less \ndevastated regions. In view of these factors, a flexible design is adopted for the ETESP. Its key \nfeatures are as follows (Figure 1, page 12): \n \n\nThematic  approach.  All  activities  under  the  ETESP  will  be  categorized  under \ntwo  basic  themes:  facilitating  economic  revival  by  restoring  livelihood,  and \nalleviating  public  goods  constraints  by  restoring  essential  public  services  and \nrebuilding infrastructure.  \n\nClustering  of  sectors.  The  ETESP  will  maintain  flexibility  in  the  allocation  of \nresources within and across the sector  groupings (para. 32), to ensure that ADB \ncan meet the emerging needs and align its support to the plans of other donors. \nPeriodic  updates,  with  a  mapping  of  donor  support  as  it  emerges  in  various \nsectors,  will  be  provided  in  the  quarterly  reports  on  Asian  Tsunami  Fund \nutilization to the ADB Board of Directors.  \n\nPhasing  of  support.  As  the  level  of  devastation  varies  across  the  affected \nregions, ADB support will need to be designed and delivered in a phased manner \nbased on readiness. Spatial planning is a key dimension of the DMRR process. \nIn  the  initial  stages  of  phase  1  (on  approval  of  the  ETESP),  the  principal  focus \nwill be on rebuilding in areas where  DMRR can proceed without complex spatial \ndecisions  and  on  supporting  preparatory  work,  such  as  spatial  planning, \nresettlement  surveys and planning, and environment assessments, in the most \ndevastated areas. In phase 2 (tentatively scheduled to begin in the third or fourth \nquarter  of  2005),  once  ground  work  is  undertaken  in  devastated  areas, \nsubprojects will be  formulated  and  launched. Both phases will be completed by \nJune 2008. \n\n \n34. \nSubproject  Modality.  The  ETESP\u2019s  sector  project  approach  facilitates  designing \nsubprojects based on feasibility studies and community consultations. The subproject modality \nwill  ensure  that  ADB  can  effectively  coordinate  ETESP  components  with  the  support  provided \nby  other  donors,  including  MDTF  subprojects.  ETESP  subprojects  will  be  designed,  where \nfeasible,  by  integrating  multisector  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  needs.  Cross-sector \nsynergies  will  be  maximized  by  adopting  integrated  community  development  approaches.  For \ninstance, in the case of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, a subproject will be defined at the \ndistrict  level  with  all  its  activities  aimed  at  rehabilitating  agricultural or fisheries resources and \nthe related infrastructure, restoring rural livelihoods, and strengthening the related government \ninstitutions and farmer organizations. In the case of irrigation, a subproject will be defined as an \nindependent irrigation system or a group of inter-linked irrigation systems. Integrated community \ndevelopment  approaches  will  be  adopted  for  subprojects  in  the  housing  sector.  Road  sector \nsubprojects will be defined as a specific section of a road, along with part or all of the drainage \n\n\fand crossing structures within the section. In the case of the health sector, a subproject will be \ndefined at the district level with project support for health care programs. \n \n35. \nAddressing  the  MDG  Challenge .  In  line  with  its  overall  goal,  the  ETESP  will  be \nstructured  as  a  set  of  subprojects  to  help  the  affected  regions  eventually  progress  toward  the \nMDGs.  The  goal  is  based  on  the  premise  that  the  DMRR  efforts  toward  the  MDGs  must  also \ntake  into  account  the  negative  impact  of  the  civil  conflict  on  the  quantity  and  quality  of  public \nservices.  The  ETESP  will  support  the  Government  in  establishing  an  MDG  monitoring  system \nas a decision-making tool to (i) track the overall emergency aid flows to different regions in Aceh \nand  North  Sumatra,  (ii)  assess  support  given  the  needs,  and  (iii)  redirect  aid  to  underserved \nareas. \n \nD. \n \n36. \nThe ETESP adopts a sequential approach, following on from the support offered by ADB \nunder reprogramming of ongoing projects (para. 21 and footnote 3). Appendix 2 contains details \non  the  sector  interventions  outlined  here,  including  their  scope  and  cost  estimates. \nSupplementary Appendix 1 presents the key guiding principles of ETESP as presented in Figure \n1, page 12, and outlines how they are integrated into the design of the sector interventions. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nLivelihood Restoration \n\n37. \nAgriculture.  The  earthquake  and  tsunami  damage  to  agriculture  has  been  extensive. \nThe  farmers  in  the  affected  areas  lost  their  standing  crops  and  livestock,  and  will  continue  to \nincur substantial losses in the medium to long term due to siltation and salinization of farmlands, \nand  damaged  infrastructure  for  irrigation,  drainage,  flood  control,  and  land  erosion.  An \nestimated  40,000  ha  of  cropland  and  37,000  ha  of  tree  crops  were  damaged. Furthermore, \n140,000  large  ruminants,  90,000  small  ruminants,  and  1.6  million  poultry  were  lost.  Total \ndamage  to  agriculture  is  estimated  at  $120  million,  while  income  losses  until  full  recovery  are \nexpected  to  reach  $145  million  (Table  1,  note).  Agricultural  support  services  have  also  been \nseverely affected.  \n  \nThe  ETESP  will  focus  on  restoring  support  services,  empowering  the  community,  and \n38. \nrestoring  crop  farming.  The  recovery  of  agriculture  will  require  fully  functional  and  effective \nsupport  services.  This  calls  for  (i)  capacity  building  of  institutions  and  human  resources;  (ii) \nrecruitment  of  agricultural  graduates,  preferably  coming  from  the  affected  areas,  initially  on  a \ncontractual  basis,  who  may  later  be  absorbed  by  the  district  and  provincial governments into \ntheir regular cadres; (iii) training for 250 new and 350 existing staff in the participatory extension \nmethodologies,  land  use  planning,  crop  production,  and  remedial  measures  to  address \nsalinization and other tsunami-related issues; and (iv) rehabilitation of key agricultural facilities, \nand provision of necessary equipment and vehicles. \n \n39. \nFisheries. Fisheries is one of the hardest hit sectors. Most of the fishing communities in \nthe  affected  areas  lost  their  boats,  fishing  gear,  and  equipment;  incurred  heavy  damage  to \nfishponds and small-scale processing facilities; and will remain affected in the medium to long \nterm  by  the  damage  to  the  coastal  resources  and  the  supporting  infrastructure,  such  as  fish-\nlanding  and  auction  market  facilities.  The  restoration  and  recovery  of  livelihoods  may  be \npainstakingly slow. Total damage to the sector is estimated at $260 million. Income losses until \nfull recovery are expected at $408 million. Furthermore, the loss to the coastal environment in \nterms  of  loss  of  coral  reefs,  mangroves,  and  sea-grass  bed  is  estimated  at  $468  million. \nFisheries  extension  and  support  services  have  also  been  severally  affected. \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Framework for the Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project \n\n1\n2\n \n\nOverall Goal: Help rebuild the affected regions and support their revival to meet the Millennium Development Goals. \n \nImmediate Purpose : The Project will provide disaster management, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (DMRR) support to  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nfacilitate economic revival by restoring livelihoods (Theme 1), and  \nrestore essential public services and rebuild infrastructure (Theme 2).  \n\nPhase 1: Focus on Urgent Priorities and DMRR in \nLess Devastated Zones (April 2005\u2013June 2007) \n\nPhase 2: Focus on DMRR in Devastated Zones   \n(Until mid-2008) \n\nTheme 1 \n\nTheme 2 \n\n \nFacilitate restoration of: \n \n\u2022  Livelihood through targeted \ninterventions in agriculture, \nfisheries, and enterprises \n\n\u2022  Lost stock of private \n\nhousing, in an integrated \nmanner to restore local \neconomies \n\n \nPriority focus on \n \n\n\u2022  health \n\u2022  skills development \n\u2022  rural water and sanitation \n\u2022  irrigation and flood control  \n\u2022  roads and bridges \n\u2022  spatial planning, \n\nenvironmental and other \ntechnical assessments \n\n\u2022  fiduciary governance  \n\nTheme 1 \n\n \n\u2022  Economic revival support \nthrough formal institutional \nmechanisms and self-help \ngroups in agriculture, \nfisheries, and enterprises  \n\u2022  Community-based housing \n\nintegrated with other \ndevelopment and livelihood \ninitiatives \n\nTheme 2 \n\n \n\u2022  Expansion of phase 1 \n\nactivities into devastated \nzones, and other social \nservices such as \neducation \n\n\u2022  Community infrastructure \n\u2022  Spatial redesign of \naffected  regions \n\n\u2022  Power (with focus on rural \n\nelectrification) \n\n \n\nKey Guiding Principles for all Subprojects: 1. Communitywide integrated development, 2. Participatory mechanisms in design and \nimplementation, 3. Capacity building in  public administration, 4. Sound spatial planning and environmental management, 5. Facilitation of \nprivate sector participation, and 6. Enhanc ement of fiduciary governance. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nTo  help  rehabilitate  the  fisheries  sector  and  reestablish  livelihoods,  the  ETESP  will \n40. \nprovide technical and financial support and production inputs to (i) 12,000 affected small-scale \nfishers for repairing and restoring their fishing boats, boat engines, and gear; (ii) 2,000 affected \nsmall-scale  fish  farmers  for  rehabilitation  of  3,000  ha  of  fishponds  in  seven  major  aquaculture \ndistricts;  and  (iii)  80  affected  coastal  communities  for  rehabilitation  of  about  12  fish-landing \nfacilities, as well as for community-based applied research activities.  \n \n41.  Microenterprises.  Aceh\u2019s  economy  has  been  dominated  by  family-owned firms, many \nof  them  small  and  most  operating  outside  the  formal  economy.  Most  Acehnese  households \nhave relied either on agriculture or fishing as the main source of income. According to a 2002 \nsurvey  on  small-scale  informal  businesses  by  the  national  statistical  service,  only  65 \nestablishments  classified  as  medium  or  large  firms  were  operating  in  2002.  The  survey \nestimated  that  Aceh  had  around  190,000  micro  and  small  enterprises,  each  employing  an \naverage of 1.8 people. About 80,000 of these businesses, or about 140,000 jobs, are estimated \nto have been lost due to the disaster. Micro and small enterprises did not enjoy broad access to \nfinancial services prior to the disaster, though some institutional providers of microfinance were \noperating  prior  to  the  tsunami,  notably,  about  20  village  banks,  of  which  at  least  nine  have \nsurvived the disaster and resumed limited operations. There has, however, never been a strong \ninstitutional  foundation  for  microfinance  in  Aceh,  necessitating  efforts  to  develop  grassroots \nfoundations  for  institutional  microfinance,  starting  with  the  microenterprises  themselves.  In \naddition,  the  small  surviving  microfinance  institutions  need  assistance  to  recover  their \nsustainability. The ETESP will establish a technical support unit to manage the microenterprise \ncomponent and provide technical assistance to microfinance institutions. The ETESP will  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nSupport the development of a commercial microfinance system. Substantial \nsupport is needed for reviving livelihoods in the affected regions, and sustainable \nincome  generating  capacity  is  a  prerequisite  to  creating  and  expanding \nmicrofinance  institutions,  including  rural  banks,  many  of  which  are  privately \nowned,  and  other  institutions  including  savings  and  credit  associations.  The \nETESP,  building  on  the  JFPR  grant  project  (para.22),  will  develop  appropriate \nmodalities to deliver microfinance support. In particular, the ETESP will establish \na microfinance fund, to provide funding support for microfinance institutions and \nthe  Provincial  Development  Bank  that  seek  to  serve  microenterprises.  The \nETESP will support such institutions in the areas of  operations, product design, \nfinancial management, accounting and auditing. \n\nEstablish  an  innovation  fund.  The  fund  will  provide  long-term  debt  and/or \nequity  for  (a)  demonstrably  viable  financial  institutions  that  want  to  restore  and \nexpand their operations in the province, but are short of investment capital; and \n(b)  new  financial  institutions,  primarily  leasing  companies.  The  fund  will  support \nfinancial  innovations,  and  promote  investment  in  new  financial  firms.  Some \nShariah-based  institutions  are  operating,  though  on  a  small  scale.  Utilizing  and \nexpanding this risk-sharing financial modality will be worthwhile. Shariah leasing \nis a new concept and appears to offer promise as a way of financing small-scale \nequipment  leasing  needed  by  existing  and  new  micro  and  small  enterprises. \nLocal  institutions  that  demonstrate  fundamental  soundness  may  be  allowed  to \nborrow longer term to finance their capital expenditures, including investments in \nnew service technologies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n2. \n\n     Social Service  Provision \n\n42. \nHealth.  The  DLA  for  the  health  sector  estimated  that  Aceh  suffered  damage  of  $82 \nmillion,  with  about  75%  borne  by  public  sector  facilities.  The  estimates  include  the  cost  of \nreconstruction of lost or damaged buildings, replacement of damaged equipment, replacement \nof  staff  perished  in  the  disaster,  and  additional  cost  of  health  treatment  and  public  health \ninterventions in response to the disaster.  \n \nBefore initiating the DMRR activities, ETESP will support the development of  a strategic \n43. \nplan  for  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  health  services,  building  on  the  DMRR  blueprint,  to \nprovide  effective  approaches  for  health  service  delivery  to  address  the  health  needs  and \nplacement  of  population,  identify  challenges  faced  by  the  public  sector,  and  assess  strengths \nand complementary support offered by NGOs and the private sector. This assessment will help \nthe  Government  develop  a  health  system  that  will  appropriately  address  health  needs  with \nimproved efficiency and effectiveness.  \n \nThe ETESP will go beyond replacing the damaged health facilities, and will restructure \n44. \nthe health care delivery system with full participation of the affected communities. Health sector \ninterventions  of  the  ETESP  will  (i)  design  an  efficiently  functioning  and  rationalized  health \nservice delivery network for the province; (ii) strengthen primary health care and its referral links \nto  district  hospitals;  build  sustainable  institutions  of  continuing  education  for  nurses  and \nmidwives; and strengthen provincial and district health capacity; (iii) strengthen 15\u201320 selected \nfacilities  that  provide  outreach  services  for  primary  health  care;  and  (iv)  upgrade  and  reequip \nabout  2\u20133  district  hospitals.  Provincial  and  district  health  management  will  receive  priority \nattention  in  terms  of  providing  capacity-building  support  for  sector  planning,  coordination, \nmanagement,  human  resource  planning  and  development,  and  financial  management  and \naccounting systems to track the flow of health sector support. This component will also develop \nmechanisms to allow for public-private partnerships in service delivery, training, and monitoring.  \n \n45. \nEducation. The disaster has caused serious damage to the education infrastructure and \nled to the loss of thousands of education professionals. About 600 schools in Aceh and North \nSumatra are estimated to have been destroyed or damaged extensively. This includes at least \n30  madrasah schools.  An  estimated  2,500  teachers  are  estimated  to  have  died,  in  addition  to \nserious losses among education administrators in local governments. About 70,000 children are \nestimated  to  be  among  the  internally  displaced  people.  Many  teachers  and  students  are \nseverely traumatized. The impact on poor families has been significant in terms of disruption of \neducation  services,  and  imperiling  future  human  resource  development  and  livelihoods  of  the \npoor in these areas. The need for rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools and madrasah is \nurgent  in  order  to  minimize  disruption  to  the  education  of  children  and  young  adults,  reduce \ntrauma, and bring normalcy to people\u2019s lives. The total cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction \nin  the  education  sector  is  estimated  by  the  Government  at  over  $700  million,  with  primary  to \nsenior secondary schools and madrasahs accounting for $300 million. \n \n46. \nADB\u2019s  ongoing  projects  in  basic  and  higher  education  provide  immediate  support  for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  schools  and  higher  education  institutions,  cumulatively \namounting  to  $16.5  million.  Several  other  donors  are  involved  in  the  education  sector.  The \nETESP  will  support  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  educational  institutions  in  phase  2, \nbased on a full mapping of the DMRR needs with the support of other development partners.  \n \n47. \nSkills  Development.  Close  to  a  million  people  directly  or  indirectly  affected  by  the \ndisaster will need some form of livelihood support in the next 2\u20133 years. As a considerable part \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nof  the  private  sector  has  been  wiped  out,  people  who  have  lost  their  livelihoods  and  out-of-\nschool youth must be reskilled through vocational training that will help them find employment. \nThe ETESP will provide support for training about 6,000 individuals in utility-oriented technical \nareas,  such  as  electrical  and  electronics,  computer,  automotive,  carpentry,  brick-making, and \nsewing.    Appropriate  targeting  mechanisms  will  be  used  to  ensure  coordination  with  support \nfrom the Government and other donors. \n \n\n3. \n\n    Community Infrastructure \n\n48. \nRural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  Water  and  sanitation  service  coverage  in  Aceh \nand North Sumatra was below the national average before the disaster. Only about 9% of the \nAceh  population  and  24%  of  North  Sumatra  inhabitants  benefited  from  piped  water  supply, \nacross  rural  and  urban  areas.  Similar  to  many  other  areas  throughout  the  country,  system \nefficiency was low, with nonrevenue water estimated at 30\u201350% on average. The majority of the \npopulation,  in  particular  in  rural  areas,  relied  on  self-provision  or  community-based systems \n(mostly dug wells and hand pumps), and private small-scale water providers and vendors. Prior \nto the tsunami, the sanitation sector was mainly characterized by on-site sanitation (septic tanks \nand pit latrines), but coverage was extremely low and virtually nonexistent in many rural villages \nof these two provinces. What was existent before has now been completely wiped out in most \nurban and rural areas struck by the tsunami. Data on water supply damage, in particular in rural \nareas, are still sparse and do not include rural sanitation damage and losses. The DLA is likely \nto be substantially revised upward once more detailed assessments are completed. \n \n49. \nThe improvement of water supply and sanitation facilities for the population in Aceh and \nNorth  Sumatra  has  reached  a  new  level  of  urgency. Increases in the incidence of waterborne \nand  water-related  diseases  such  as  diarrhea,  intestinal  worms,  skin  diseases,  malaria,  and \ndengue are highly probable in the current situation. While the focus during the immediate relief \nphase has been on prevention of communicable disease outbreaks, which  have the potential to \nkill many people, concerted interventions will be necessary to  (i) ensure that disease outbreaks \nare controlled after phasing out of relief efforts, and (ii) reduce the incidence of waterborne and \nwater-related diseases in the provinces in the medium and long term on a sustainable basis. \n \nThe  ETESP  will  follow  the  design  of  the  Aceh-North  Sumatra  Emergency  Assistance \n50. \nGrant component under the  proposed Community Water Services and Health Project. In  phase \n1,  the  ETESP  will  provide  support  to  rehabilitate  rural  water  and  sanitation  facilities  in  villages \nwith  repairable  damage  and  extend  at  least  temporary  coverage  of  facilities  into  communities \nwith  a  large  influx  of  internally  displaced  people.  Based  on  progress,  feasibility,  and  spatial \nplanning assessments,  the  ETESP  will  develop  new  facilities  in  reestablished  settlements  in \nphase 2.  For new facilities, communities themselves will decide on the type of technology to be \nused, plan and implement the activity with the assistance of community facilitators, take charge \nof  operation  and  maintenance  on  a  permanent  basis,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nsustainability  and  use  of  the  new  services.  The  provision  of  appropriate  technical  solutions at \naffordable  costs  will  be  coupled  with  capacity  strengthening  of  local  governments  and \ncommunities  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  infrastructure  provided,  through  information, \neducation,  and  communication  campaigns  on  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases;  and \nsanitation and hygiene behavioral change programs.   About 150 villages and 80,000 people in \nthe affected districts are expected to benefit from the ETESP. \n \nIrrigation.  Prior  to  the  disaster,  465  irrigation  schemes  in  Aceh  covered  over 335,000 \n51. \nha.  They  were  classified  as  government-developed  schemes  (about  57%  of  the  area)  and \nfarmers\u2019  schemes  (about  43%).  Due  to  poor  maintenance,  only  70%  of  the  schemes  were \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nfunctional.  The  irrigation  schemes  have  suffered  both  tsunami  and  earthquake  damage. The \ntsunami  damage  was  caused  by  the  temporary  flooding  of  downstream  parts  of  schemes \nsituated  relatively  close  to  the  coastline.  The  damage  consists  mainly  of  deposits  of  various \nnatures  on  fields,  and  partial  or  complete  destruction  of  the  canal  infrastructure.  Damage  of \nirrigation  systems,  including  technical,  semitechnical,  and  simple  systems,  are  reported  in  10 \ndistricts4 in Aceh and 6 districts in North Sumatra,5 although the latter account for only 5% of the \noverall  damage.  Typical  damage  includes  cracks  and  occasional  displacement/settlement  of \nmasonry structures, slip failures in canal and river embankments, and collapse of culverts. More \nthan  64,000  ha  of  irrigation  schemes  in  Aceh  are  reported  to  have  some  kind  of  earthquake \ndamage, though information on village irrigation schemes is being still collated. Total damage to \nthe Government-developed irrigation schemes is estimated at Rp667 billion ($72 million).  \n\nThe  ETESP  will  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami  and  earthquake  damaged  irrigation \n52. \ninfrastructure with a total service area of about 32,600 ha. In phase 1, rehabilitation support will \nbe provided to irrigation infrastructure in the less-damaged areas of the northeast coast of Aceh \n(31,300  ha)  and  North  Sumatra  (1,300  ha).  Phase  1  will  also  provide  for  feasibility  studies  of \nirrigation  schemes  covering  7,000  ha  in  the  heavily  affected  areas  on  the  west  coast  of  Aceh, \nwhich will be rehabilitated during phase 2.  \n \n53. \nProvision of  Housing  within  an  Integrated  Community  Development  Framework. \nThe  DLA  estimates  indicate  that  about  127,000  houses  have  been  completely  destroyed, \ndisplacing  over  400,000  people.  Furthermore,  about  152,000  housing  units  were  damaged at \nabout  50%  of  their  value.  The  overall  damage  has  been  estimated  at  $1.4  billion,  including \nreconstruction and rehabilitation costs, temporary shelter, debris removal, tertiary infrastructure \nrepair,  and  furniture.  Much  of  the  damage  was  concentrated  near  the  coastal  zones  in  Aceh \nBarat, Aceh  Besar,  Aceh  Jaya,  Banda  Aceh  and  Kota  Meulaboh.  The  losses  transcend  the \nphysical  impact.  While  affected  by  the  civil  conflict,  which  impeded  delivery  of  essential \nservices,  housing  settlements  still  functioned  as  homogeneous  communities.  Many  have  now \nbeen  torn  apart.  In  many  locations  land  ownership  records  and  planning  documents  are lost. \nThe  housing  rehabilitation/reconstruction  program  will  be  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  policy \ndecision  to  grant  a  36  square  meter  core  housing  unit  to  all  earthquake-tsunami  affected \nfamilies,  irrespective  of  their  previous  housing  status.  A  range  of  delivery  mechanisms  will  be \nneeded,  including  community-based  housing,  support  for  private  housing,  public  housing \nschemes, self-help rebuilding programs, and NGO-provided housing. None of these approaches \nalone would be able to meet all requirements.  \n \nThe ETESP will cover replacement and repairs of about  24,000 units. Given the urgent \n54. \nneed  of  those  without  any  housing,  the  focus  will  be  on  providing  new  shelters.  The  housing \nsubprojects  will  be  designed  in  coordination  with  other  development  partners  likely  to  provide \nsupport\u2014World Bank, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW-GTZ), UN Habitat, and World Vision. The ETESP will facilitate community \nparticipation  and  finance  community-based  housing  (both  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction), \nestablishment of support centers to provide materials and skilled labor where appropriate, and \nprovision  of  a  microcredit  facility  for  house  expansions.  It  will  also  provide  essential  additional \nsupport  for  neighborhood  infrastructure  like  on-site  water  and  sanitation  works; and may also \ncover  off-site  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure,  paths,  streets,  and  basic  drainage, which in \nmany  cases  need  to  be  treated  as  an  integral  part  of  such  subprojects.  Initial  priority  will  be \n\n                                                 \n4   Aceh  Barat,  Aceh  Barat  Daya,  Aceh  Besar  (Banda  Aceh),  Aceh  Jaya,  Aceh Selatan,  Aceh Utara, Aceh Timur, \n\nBireuen, Nagan Raya, and Pidie. \n\n5   Deli Serdang, Langkat, Nias, Madina, Serdang Bedagai, and Tapanuli Tengah.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\ngiven  to  urban  or  semi-urban areas. The ETESP will cover  some  anti-seismic capacity  needs \nand  safeguards  for  later  house  expansion,  and  will  promote  the  use  of  environment-friendly, \npreferably  locally  available  and  renewable  building  materials.  The  water  and  sanitation  works \nwill make use of appropriate low-cost decentralized technologies that are easy to operate and \nmaintain.  The  housing  component  will  utilize  only  sites  for  which  land  titles  are  available  or \ntenure  status  is  assured.  A  team  of  housing  experts  is  being  engaged  to  help  structure  this \ncomponent  to  ensure  that  the  communities  receive  the  necessary  technical  support  and \nmaterials for the reconstruction. \n \n\n4. \n\n    Physical Infrastructure \n\n55. \nSpatial  Planning  and  Environmental  Management.  With  many  areas  swept  by  the \ntsunami, government and  other groups see an opportunity to introduce a new land use/zoning \nplan before commencing large-scale DMRR activities. This ETESP component will support the \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  process  for  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra  by  providing  technical \nsupport,  in  an  adaptive  and  flexible  manner,  to  the  integrated  participatory  spatial  planning \nprocess,  incorporating  the  dimensions  of  environmental  management  and  disaster  mitigation. \nCommunity participation in the decision-making process and ownership in the rebuilding of the \naffected  areas  will  be  at  the  core  of  the  activities,  and  relevant  institutional  capacities  will  be \nreestablished. Already successfully tested principles and procedures of integrated coastal zone \nand watershed management in Indonesia provide a framework for decision-making, and will be \napplied and further adapted to the specific context of the tasks ahead. \n\n56. \nIn  support  of  the  process  of  planning  for  a  sustainable  future  for  the  affected  areas, \nenvironmental  criteria  for  the  spatial  planning  and  zoning  process  will  be  developed,  and \nbaseline  environment-related  information  collected.  Technical  advice  will  be  provided  on  ADB \nand  government  policies,  laws,  and  regulations  relating  to  the  requirements  for  environmental \nassessment  and  to  carry  out  environmental  assessments  for  subprojects,  in  accordance  with \nthe environmental assessment and review procedures as they have been set up for the entire \nETESP.  \n\n57. \nRoad Sector. Of the six major roads in the affected areas, 22% of the road pavement \nand 10% of the bridges are estimated to be either severely damaged or completely destroyed. \nThe road network along the west, east, and north coasts of Aceh province and in Nias Islands of \nNorth  Sumatra  province  has  been  damaged  with  some  sections  entirely  washed  away  by  the \ntsunami  waves.  On  the  294  km  Banda  Aceh-Meulaboh  road,  80  km  are  missing,  120  km  are \nheavily  damaged,  and  almost  two  thirds  of  the  171  bridges  have  been  destroyed.  The  Banda \nAceh-Krueng  Raya  road  on  the  north  coast  and  Banda  Aceh  urban  roads  have  also  been \ndamaged;  about  50%  of  the  158  km  needs  to  be  reconstructed.  On  Nias  Islands,  north  and \nsouthwest  roads  have  been  damaged.  On  about  30  km  of  the  Banda  Aceh-Lhoksemauwe-\nBts.Sumut  road,  located  along  the  east  coast,  the  pavement  is  cracked  partly  due  to  the \nearthquake. Following the destruction of the west coast road, the traffic on the east coast road is \nincreasing  beyond  its  capacity.  Due  to  impassable  or  heavily  damaged  roads,  the  traffic  is \ndiverted  through  much  longer  and  congested  routes.  The  economic  losses  due  to  vehicle \noperating  cost  increase  are  estimated  at  about  $100  million  equivalent.  Overall  damage  to \ntransport infrastructure is estimated at $178 million.  \n\n58. \nThe Government has requested ADB to help rehabilitate and reconstruct the east coast \nroad  (Banda  Aceh-Sigli-Lhokseumawe-Bts.Sumut  road),  Banda  Aceh-Krueng  Raya  road,  and \nBanda Aceh urban roads. The total road length to be rehabilitated, including bridges, is 115 km. \nInitial  support  to  rehabilitate  20  km  of  the  affected  roads  will  be  provided  under  an  ongoing \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nproject.6 The ETESP will finance the rehabilitation and partial reconstruction of the remaining 95 \nkm of damaged roads and bridges. Additional assistance may be needed to upgrade and repair \nroads currently under stress due to heavy relief use. This will be monitored during phase 1. \n\n \nEnergy Sector. Damage to public power supply is concentrated in Aceh, particularly in \n59. \nBanda  Aceh,  Bireuen,  Meulaboh,  and  Sigli  regions.  The  main  damage  is  to  distribution \nnetworks.  The  National  Electricity  Corporation  estimates  the  damage  in  these  four  regions  at \n1,485  circuit-km  of  medium  voltage  lines,  3,404  circuit-km  of  low  voltage  lines,  45  megavolt-\namperes of distribution transformer capacity, and 90,000 household customer connections. The \n150-kilovolt  transmission  lines  and  substations  are  practically  unaffected  and  are  functioning \nnormally. Damage to generation facilities was also less severe. The main power plants in Banda \nAceh and Meulaboh only suffered minor damage to transformer and maintenance facilities. A 10 \nmegawatt barge-mounted power plant has significant hull damage. Taking into account damage \nto  the  distribution  networks,  generation  facilities,  and  National  Electricity  Corporation  office \nbuildings  and  warehouses,  the  corporation  estimates  the  total  damage  at  $45.6  million \nequivalent. \n \n60. \nThe  ETESP  will  help  restore  power  supply  in  the  affected  regions  of  Banda  Aceh, \nMeulaboh, and Sigli by reconstructing 31 circuit-km of medium voltage and 1,294 circuit-km of \nlow  voltage  distribution  lines,  and  35  megavolt-amperes  of  transformer  capacity.  Most  of  the \ndamaged  medium  voltage  distribution  lines  will  be  restored  with  resources  from  an  ongoing \nproject.  The  ETESP  will  focus  on  low  voltage  distribution  lines  as  an  extension  of  the \nreprogramming support. \n \n\n5. \n\nFiduciary Governance  \n\n61. \nGiven DMRR needs of around $4.7 billion over the next 4 years, fund flows through the \nbudget  to  line  ministries  and  local  governments  will  be  substantial.  Sound  oversight \narrangements are vital  to  ensure  that  donor  assistance  is  utilized  in  an  efficient,  transparent, \nand accountable manner.  ADB has adopted a comprehensive approach to ensure that effective \ngovernance arrangements are in place to help oversee the flow of funds of donor assistance at \nlarge,  as  well  as  the  flow  of  funds  of  ETESP.  ETESP  support  for  enhancing  fiduciary \ngovernance consists of two sub-components aimed at: \n\n \n\nStrengthening fiduciary oversight \n\na. \n\n(i) \n\nETESP  will  support  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  establishing  a  special  treasury \noffice for DMRR activities. The office will act as a dedicated cash manager for the \nGovernment and as an important conduit in the flow of funds for DMRR, including \nthe  handling  of  foreign  exchange  transactions,  which  is  currently  done  only  in \nJakarta. Given the emergency needs, this dedicated payment facility will expedite \nthe local delivery of services. The ETESP will also support the design of effective \ninternal  control  systems  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  be  utilized  at  all \ngovernment levels.    \n\n(ii) \n\nETESP will leverage support for state audit institutions with cofinancing from the \nGovernment of Netherlands to strengthen fiduciary oversight for DMRR activities7 \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2000.

BPK  will  submit  cases  of  obvious  misappropriation  to  the  Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office and the Commission for Eradication of Corruption. The ETESP \nwill provide operational support for investigative activities of the commission.   \n\nEnhancing governance in the delivery of ETESP assistance \n\nETESP  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  newly  established  BKP  to  ensure \neffective  delivery  of  ETESP  support,  with  focus  on:  (a)  sound  financial \nmanagement  \u2013 to record all transactions in a transparent manner and track the \nflow  of  funds  to  the  final  stages  of  utilization  to  enhance  overall  transparency, \naccountability,  and  disclosure;  (b)  designing  administrative  accountability \nmechanisms  \u2013  to  help  BKP  and  other  concerned  government  authorities  to \nimprove  the  overall  accountability  of  DMRR  support;  (c)  efficient  procurement \narrangements \u2013 to design effective procurement mechanisms and systems, and \nundertake  special  and \nrandom  procurement  audits  and  performance \nchecks/audits  in  the  implementation  of  ETESP;  and  (d)  effective  project \nimplementation \u2013 to provide overall support for implementation of ADB-supported \nprojects and subprojects in Aceh and North Sumatra        \n\nETESP  will  enhance  overall  accountability  of  ETESP  assistance,  through \nparticipatory planning and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, with  focus on \n(a) community participation  \u2013  to  facilitate  networking  civil  society  and  NGOs  as \nintermediaries  for  support  in  a  transparent  and  effective  manner;  (b)  using  land \ntenure assessment to support restoration of land records and facilitate resolution \nof  disputes  through  participatory  mechanisms  in  selected  parts  of  Aceh;  (c) \nrealizing  the  MDGs  \u2013  through  designing  a  real-time  monitoring,  reporting  and \nevaluation  system,  with  benchmarks  based  on  predisaster  data,  that  will  help \nmonitor  the  distribution  of  DMRR  support  across  the  affected  regions,  with  the \nultimate  aim  of  ensuring  that  they  are  supported  in  meeting  quantifiable  targets \nunder the MDGs in a balanced manner; and (d) establishing an effective system \nfor monitoring subproject progress under the ETESP and evaluating mid-course \noutcomes.8   \n\n \n\nE. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nCost Estimates.

It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $290.0 million from its Asian \nTsunami Fund resources. The Netherlands Government will finance $3.5 million equivalent for \nthe  fiduciary  oversight  support  component  of  the  ETESP.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining $28.0 million of the local costs covering local taxes and other regular administrative \ncosts.  The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nADB through Asian Tsunami Fund for ETESP \n\nGovernment of Netherlands \n\nGovernment of Indonesia \n\nTotal  \n\nTotal  \n290.0 \n\n3.5 \n\n28.0 \n\n321.5 \n\n \n\n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n64. \nThe  Government  is  expected  to  issue  a  Decree  establishing  the  BKP  in  April  2005 \n(para.6), to coordinate the overall implementation of DMRR support in the affected regions. With \noffices in Banda Aceh and Jakarta, BKP will be responsible for all DMRR activities supported by \nany donors, including the MDTF or other bilateral development partners. The structure of BKP, \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nas per the current plan being formulated by the Government, provides for (i) an implementation  \ncoordination board to manage day-to-day operations; (ii) a steering board, comprising selected \ncabinet  ministers,  the  governors  of  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra,  and  heads  of  district \nadministrations,  to  act  as  a  steering  committee  for  BKP;  and  (iii)  a  supervisory  board, \ncomprising  various  NGOs,  universities,  and  other  respected  institutions,  to  provide  community \noversight  of  DMR R  activities.  BKP  is  expected  to  have  six  operational  departments  along \nfunctional  lines.  In  addition,  DMRR  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  external  audit.  \nDetails of the proposed BKP structure are in Appendix 4. \n \n65. \nOnce established, BKP will be the Executing Agency for  the ETESP, with responsibility \nfor  its  overall  management  and  coordination.  In  the  interim,  BAPPENAS  will  function  as  the \nacting Executing Agency. ETESP subprojects will be implemented by the line ministries and the \nlocal governments concerned. The relative roles of BKP and the concerned ministries and local \ngovernments  will  be  guided  by  the  eventual  organizational  structure  of  BKP.  For  day-to-day \nETESP  management,  a  dedicated,  centralized  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be \nestablished within the BKP secretariat to (i) coordinate  ETESP implementation; (ii) ensure that \nADB support is fully aligned with the DMRR strategy; (iii) enhance synergies and ensure close \ncoordination  of  ADB  support  with  projects  financed  by  the  MDTF  and  other  development \npartners;  and  (iv)  provide  guidance  to,  and  monitor  the  activities  of, the  project management \nunits  (PMUs)  to  be  established  in  the  line  ministries.  As  BKP  is  likely  to  face  significant \ndemands  on  its  resources,  the  ETESP  will  provide  support  to  the  PMO  to  ensure  sound \ncoordination of subproject implementation. This support will take the form of a dedicated PMO \nmanager reporting to the head of BKP, and appropriate technical and administrative staff.  \n \nIn  terms  of  implementation  arrangements  at  the  line  ministry  and  local  government \n66. \nlevels,  the  ETESP  will  adopt  a  simplified  structure  reflecting  the  emergency  character  of  the \nassistance.  The  implementation  of  subprojects in each sector covered by  the  ETESP will be \nundertaken  by  the  concerned  line  ministry,  which  will  act  as  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA), \nworking  in  collaboration  with  the  local  governments  concerned.  Each  IA  will  establish  an \nadequately staffed PMU, which will coordinate with the PMO in BKP. The  provincial and district \ngovernments (through the line bureaus) will work with the PMUs for subproject implementation.  \n \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  providing  guidelines  to  the  PMUs  on  the fiduciary \n67. \nsystem, including funds flow and disbursement, procurement, record keeping, and reporting; (ii) \nconsolidating  and  reviewing  subproject  proposals  from  the  IAs  to  be  submitted  for  BKP and \nADB  approval;  (iii)  providing  guidance  to  the  PMUs  in  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents; \nand  reviewing  the  procedures  followed  by  the  PMUs  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works, \nequipment,  goods,  and \n(iv)  making \nrecommendations  on  any  special  arrangements  that  may  be  adopted  to  provide  small  grants \nunder  the  livelihood  components  to  the  affected  communities  and  NGOs  executing  selected \nsubprojects, as well as on implementation arrangements for community-contracted rehabilitation \nactivities;  (v)  submitting  the  required  withdrawal  applications  for  disbursements, including the \nrelated  supporting  documentation  and  reconciliation  of  the  imprest  (special)  account;  (vi) \npreparing  the  consolidated  financial  reports  from  the  PMUs  as  required;  (vii)  preparing  and \nsubmitting  progress  reports  to  BKP  and  ADB;  and  (viii)  coordinating  the  independent audit of \nsubprojects and the PMO itself. The Government has agreed to establish the PMO, and appoint \nthe  project  manager and key PMO staff  immediately  following  the  establishment  of  the  BKP. \nADB has approved advance action to recruit the PMO consultants. \n \n68. \nThe  PMUs  will  closely  liaise  with  the  local  government  working  groups  in  formulating \nsubprojects in line with the DMRR strategy, and will finalize and consolidate sector proposals for \n\nfor  all  ETESP  components; \n\nrelated  services \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nsubmission  to  BKP  for  evaluation,  in  coordination  with  the  PMO.  During  implementation,  the \nPMUs will ensure that the guidelines and procedures established by the PMO are followed and \nthat all operational and fiduciary requirements outlined are met in a satisfactory manner. All the \nfinancial and project management tasks outlined in para.67 for the PMO will be applicable to the \nPMUs as well. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n\nBKP, with support from the  PMO  and  the  PMUs, will consolidate subproject proposals \n69. \nfrom  the  local  governments,  line  ministries,  and  its  own  departments  for  consideration  for \nfinancing under  the  ETESP.  After  having  compiled  and  evaluated  the  proposals,  the  PMU  will \nsubmit them to BKP and ADB for final selection and approval in accordance with sector-specific \ncriteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB for each ETESP component.  \n\n \n70. \nADB is in the process of establishing an  Extended  Mission to Sumatra (EMS) in Medan \nand  extension  facilities  in  Kota  Banda  Aceh.  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  Resident  Mission,  with  support \nfrom  the  EMS  and  its  extension  facilities,  will  coordinate  with  the  Government  and  donor \ncommunity  in  Jakarta  and  Banda  Aceh  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  subprojects  overlap  or \nduplicate initiatives of other agencies. In addition to the sector-specific criteria to be established \nby the IAs and ADB, the following general criteria will be applied: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nclear justification backed by damage, loss, and needs assessment of acceptable \nquality and standards; \nassessment of the social and economic impact of the subproject, as well as of its \ntechnical  feasibility  and  sustainability,  with  linkages  to  the  attainment  of  the \nMDGs outlined; \nparticipatory consultations with local communities in the subproject selection and \ndesign;  \nfield  consultations  with  the  local  government,  line  ministry,  donors,  civil society \norganizations (CSOs) and NGOs to avoid duplication of other activities pursued;  \ncompliance  with  generally  accepted  design  parameters,  including  disaster \nresistance  and  any  minimum  acceptable  standards  that  the  Government  may \nprescribe;  \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  provisions  such  as  Environment \nPolicy  (2002),  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  agreed \nEnvironmental Assessment Review and Procedures (Appendix 5);9  \nfor  all  subprojects  involving  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  or  spatial  planning, \ncompliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  the  ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed  Land Acquisition and \nResettlement  Policy  Framework  and  Procedural  Guidelines  (LARPFPG)  \n(Appendix 6);10 and \nsubproject activities carried out in accordance with the ADB Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples  and \nIndigenous  Peoples  Development \nthe \nFramework (Appendix 7), which has been agreed by the Government and ADB. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\n \n71. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  subproject  proposals  in  formats  to  be  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  at  the  preparation,  submission, \n\n                                                 \n9   Supplementary  Appendix  B  presents  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Policy Framework and Procedural \n\nGuidelines, prepared by the Government.  \n\n10   Supplementary Appendix C presents the full environmental assessment and review procedure.    \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nimplementation,  and  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation  stages.

Thereafter, only subprojects costing more than $500,000 equivalent will \nhave  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and  approval.  All  subproject  proposals  are \nexpected to  be submitted for evaluation and approval by 31 September 2007. However, those \nsubprojects  exceeding  $10  million  will  be  submitted  for  evaluation  and  approval  prior  to  31 \nDecember  2006,  to  allow  sufficient  time  for  procurement  and  implementation  prior  to  the \nindicated ETESP closing date of June 2008. In the event that any subproject not requiring ADB \nprior approval does not meet the subproject selection criteria, then the Government  will not use \nthe ETESP proceeds to finance the  subproject, and will provide financing from its own or other \nresources. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n72. \nIn  line  with  its  emergency  assistance  nature,  ETESP  implementation  will  start \nimmediately  after  Board  approval  and  be  completed  in  about  3  years.  Phase  1  will  be \nimplemented  between  April  2005  and  June  2008,  and  phase 2  tentatively  between October \n2005  and  June  2008.  The  PMUs  will  prepare  implementation  schedules  for  individual \nsubprojects. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n73. \nGiven  the  urgent  DMRR  needs,  procurement  of  goods,  services ,  and  works  will  be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy and ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement. In \ngeneral, ADB procedures for reconstruction assistance after disasters allow maximum flexibility, \nso that project activities can start promptly. National procurement will be the preferred mode for \nall  civil  works  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation  period,  the  small  size  of  contract \npackages, and the wide geographic spread of subproject sites. Community participation will be \nencouraged  in  procurement,  and  local  goods  and  services  will  be  given  priority  to  encourage \neconomic revival in the affected regions. \n \nThe  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  provides  that  to  expedite \n74. \nrehabilitation assistance ADB Guidelines for Procurement may be flexibly interpreted, including \nrelaxation  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  requirements.  In  accordance  with  this \nflexibility, procurement of equipment and materials, when the estimated contract cost exceeds \n$1.0 million should follow ICB procedures, with the bidding and evaluation period each reduced \nto 30 days. International shopping procedures will be followed for contracts between $0.5 million \nand  $1.0  million,  with  bidding  periods  reduced  to  7\u201315  days.  For  contracts  costing  the \nequivalent  of  $0.5  million  or  less,  local  procedures  will  be  followed,  with  invitation  for  bids \npublished in national newspapers and with  bidding periods of 7 days and an evaluation time of \n15 days. Direct purchase procedures will be adopted for contracts up to $0.1 million, with award \nwithin 7 days.  \n \nCivil  works  contracts  with  estimated  values  above  $5.0  million  will  be  procured  in \n75. \naccordance  with  ICB  procedures,  with  the  bidding  and  evaluation  period  each  reduced  to  30 \ndays.  For  contracts  with  estimated  values  between  $0.5  million  and  $5.0  million,  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed, with a bidding period of 15\u2013\n21 days and an evaluation period of 15\u201330 days. Invitations for bids will be published in at least \ntwo  national  newspapers  of  wide  circulation  to  ensure  adequate  dissemination  of  information. \nFor small contracts up to $0.5 million, limited  local competitive bidding will be carried out, with \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nbidding and evaluation reduced to 10 days. Postqualification or the registration system (for local \ncontractors)  will  be  generally  used.  Prior  review  by  ADB  of  invitations  for  bids  and  bidding \ndocuments will be required for procurement under ICB procedures.  For international shopping, \npost-facto  approval  procedures  will  be  followed.  However,  if  during  such  post-facto reviews \nacceptable procedures are found to have not been followed, ADB will not finance the contract. If \nany grant funds have already been used, the Government will refund them to ADB.  \n \n76. \nFor  small  contracts  of  up  to  $30,000,  community-based  procurement  may  be  allowed \nwhere appropriate, following procedures set out in  the ADB Guide on Community Participation \nin  Procurement.  An  alternative  implementation  mode  will  be  to  tender  batches  of  a  few \nsubprojects or subprojects across selected project locations among private sector companies, \nNGOs,  or  foundations  that  can  demonstrate  organizational  capacity.  This  procurement  will \nfollow  procedures  set  out  in  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  administration  of  the \nlivelihood  restoration  support  for  affected  families  may  be  handled  by  organized  community \ngroups,  contractors,  NGOs,  or  foundations  that  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of  completed \ncore houses, equipment, building materials, or construction labor support. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n77. \nThe Government has agreed that all consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Since  the \nETESP will be completed in about 3 years, expeditious selection and fielding of the consultants \nwill  be  the  key  issue.  Where  possible,  simplified  procedures,  including  greater  delegated \nauthority to the Indonesia Resident Mission, will therefore be adopted. \n \n78. \nSpecifically,  the  following  flexible  modalities  will  be  adopted  for  the  selection  of \nconsultants:  (i)  all  individual  consultants  will  be  selected  on  a  direct-selection  basis;  (ii) \nconsulting  service  packages  of  less  than  $2  million  value  will  be  procured  through  bio-data \nproposals  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  with  a  proposal  submission \nperiod  of  21  days;  and  (iii)  consulting  service  packages  valued  at more than $2 million will be \nprocured  through  simplified  technical  proposals  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod with a proposal submission period of 28 days. Consulting services for sector technical \nneeds will be procured in sector-specific packages. The detailed cost estimates by sector, which \nalso include consulting needs, are in Appendix 3. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n79. \nGiven the emergency needs, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods,  services ,  and  works,  and  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  provided  this  has  taken  place \non  or  after  5  January  2005.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  such \nadvance action will not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n80. \nTimely  disbursements  and  efficient  flow  of  funds  are  essential  for  effective  emergency \nassistance. The Ministry of Finance has prepared the organizational arrangements to guide the \nflow  of  funds.  It  has  established  a  set  of  special  tsunami  reconstruction  accounts  at  Bank \nIndonesia in various currencies, into which all donor proceeds from the MDTF will be directed. \nThe Ministry of Finance will also establish a special treasury office in Aceh, supported by a grant \nfrom the ETESP (para. 61), which will act as the central channeling agent to interface between \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\nthe  central  Government  and  all  line  ministries,  provincial  and  local  governments,  and  BKP.  A \nproject-specific imprest account will be established in Bank Indonesia.  It will be maintained and \nmonitored  by  BKP,  with  support  provided  by  the  PMO.  Line ministries  will be given access to \nsubaccounts  of  this  imprest  account  so  that  they  can  use  the  funds  for  subproject \nimplementation. \n \n81. \nThe bulk of the transactions are expected to be paid for out of the imprest account, with \ndirect payments made only for some large contracts.  The imprest account will have a ceiling of \n$29 million.  It will be replenished based on the liquidation and the actual uses of funds by the \nend  beneficiaries.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  allowed  for  transactions  below \n$100,000  provided  the  appropriate  conditions  for  the  use  of  the  procedures  are  satisfied.  This \nwill  greatly  facilitate  the  speed  of  disbursements.  Disbursement  will  follow  the  guidelines \nestablished in the ADB Disbursement Handbook, June 2001. \n \n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\nThe ETESP provides for retroactive financing of immediate importations, rehabilitation of \n82. \nkey infrastructure and facilities, and provision of services and grants. ADB has agreed to allow \nretroactive  financing  of  up  to  30%  of  the  respective  ETESP  components  for  eligible \nexpenditures incurred  under  the  ETESP  before  its  effectivity,  but  not  earlier  than  5  January \n2005,  provided  that  the  budget  for  the  expenditures  has  been  approved  by  ADB  and  the \nexpenditures  have  been  incurred  in  accordance  with  agreed  procurement  procedures.  ADB \nreserves the right not to approve any expenditures, if they have not been incurred in accordance \nwith the agreed procurement procedures, ADB safeguard policies or if they are not in line with \nthe objective and scope of  the  ETESP.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  provision  of \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nFinancial Management, Accounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n83. \nThe  EMS  and  its  extension  office  in  Banda  Aceh,  ETESP  sector  consultants,  and \nperiodic  review  missions  will  closely  monitor  compliance  with ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements to \nensure  quality  control,  speedy  implementation  of  subprojects, and rapid assistance to BKP on \nproject  implementation  matters.  They  will  also  closely  monitor  anticorruption  measures \nundertaken by BKP and PMO, carry out random and spot checks on procurement and accounts \nof  the  ETESP  and  subprojects,  and  inspect  the  rehabilitated  facilities.  The  anticorruption \nmeasures adopted under the ETESP include (i) strict financial management with strengthened \ngovernment  monitoring  and  independent  monitoring  by  the  consultants,  (ii)  use  of  detailed \nsubproject selection criteria, (iii) strong project supervision with appropriate consultant input, (iv) \nregular independent performance auditing, and (v) random and independent spot checks by  the \nEMS and review missions. \n \n\nb. \n\nAccounts, Record Keeping, and Audit \n\n84. \nGuidelines  for  accounting  and  record  keeping  will  be  established  by  the  PMO   in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  PMO  and  PMUs  will  maintain  separate \nrecords  and  ac counts  for  each  subproject.  The  records  will  be  adequate  to  identify  the  goods \nand services financed by  the ETESP, together with appropriate supporting documentation. The \nrecords  and  supporting  documentation  will  be  made  available  for  any  audits  conducted  on \nproject activities. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n85. \nThree main types of external audit activities\u2014financial, procurement, and operational\u2014\nwill be carried out by external auditors acceptable to ADB. These audits will be supervised by \nBPK  in  coordination  with  the  PMO.  Where  necessary,  BPK  will  hire  appropriately  qualified \nauditors  from  the  private  sector  to  assist.  BPK  will  also  utilize  the  reports  from  the  internal \nauditors at the local level of government (Bawasdas) and the inspectors general of the central \nGovernment.  For  subproject  activities,  the  PMUs  will  coordinate  the  internal  audit  and  will \nensure  that  the  internal  audit  reports  are  provided  to  the  PMO,  BPK, and ADB. The PMO will \nestablish the internal audit guidelines as part of the overall fiduciary framework for the ETESP. \n \n86. \nFor  external  audit,  as  a  minimum,  annual  financial  audits  will  be  conducted  for  the \nconsolidated  project  accounts  and  individual  subproject  financial  accounts.  The  latter  will \ninclude  an  audit  of the use of the  imprest  account  and  statement of expenditure  procedures. \nThe audit reports and related financial statements in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. A separate opinion on the use \nof the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be included in the auditor\u2019s \nreport.  In  addition,  procurement  audits  will  ensure  that  procurement  undertaken  followed  the \nagreed  procedures.  Finally,  operational  audits will  review  the  efficiency  of  project  activities, \nensure transparency, and provide an objective and independent assessment of such activities. \n \nTo  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  proceeds,  the \n87. \nprocurement and operational performance audits will be conducted  both annually and randomly \nduring implementation as required. Reports will be submitted to BKP and ADB within 3 months \nof the completion of the random audits and  within 6 months of the end of the financial year for \nthe annual audits. \n \n\nc. \n\nReporting \n\nReporting  structures  and  arrangements  for  BKP  are  being  finalized.  Following  the \n88. \nannouncement on BKP\u2019s detailed structure, reporting links between PMU, BKP, EMS, and ADB \nwill  be  established.  The  PMO  will  prepare  brief  monthly  progress  reports,  in  a  format to be \nagreed between the Government and ADB, and submit these to BKP and ADB. In addition, the \nPMO will submit quarterly reports to BKP and ADB. Within 6 months of ETESP completion, the \nGovernment  will  provide  ADB,  through  BAPPENAS/BKP,  an  overall  project completion report \nproviding  detailed  evaluation  of  project  design,  costs,  contractor  and  consultant  performance, \nsocial and economic impact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n89. \nThe BKP, with support  through  the  PMO, will carry out project performance monitoring \nand  evaluation  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nHandbook.  Baseline  indicators  and  targets  for  each  sector  and  subproject  will  be  developed \nprior  to  implementation  for  monitoring  purposes  as  well  as  for  checking  against  selection \ncriteria. Given the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, flexibility will be used in performance \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\nThroughout  implementation,  ADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  supplemented  by  sector \n90. \nspecialists (every month during the first 8 months; and at least once every 2 months thereafter). \nThe EMS will be the anchor for this process. Given the high frequency of these reviews and the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27 \n\nrelatively  short  implementation  period,  no  midterm  review  will  be  conducted,  unless  deemed \nnecessary by ADB and the Government. \n \n\nIV. \n\nCONTRIBUTION TO THE MULTIDONOR TRUST FUND \n\n \n91.  \nTo ensure that the synergies between ADB\u2019s support and the projects and plans of other \ndonors are fully exploited, it is proposed that ADB contribute $10 million to the MDTF. A number \nof donors are expected to participate in the MDTF, with principal contributions expected to come \nfrom the European Union and the Government of Netherlands. Overall, about $500 million is to \nbe  channeled  through  MDTF.  The  World  Bank  in  its  capacity  as  the  trustee  will  co-chair the \nsteering  committee  of  the  MDTF.  The  MDTF  is  to  provide  a  financing  mechanism  for  pooling \nsmaller bilateral contributors to ensure that as much support is channeled through the budget as \npossible, and to provide close coordination of DMRR planning and implementation.  \n \n92. \nThe  proposed  contribution  will  allow  ADB  to  participate  in  the  MDTF,  including  (i) \nmembership  in  the  MDTF  steering  committee  (comprising  representatives  of  the  Government \n(through  BKP),  principal  donors,  and  civil  society  members),  which  will  be  responsible  for \nendorsing  guidelines  and  procedures,  and  coordinating  and  approving  subprojects  in \naccordance with DMRR needs; (ii) sharing of information and agreeing on common approaches \nrelating  to  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects  under  the  MDTF  and  ADB  emergency \nsupport,  including  the  ETESP,  thus  avoiding  duplication  of  activities;  and  (iii)  opportunities for \nADB to cofinance MDTF programs and for the MDTF to cofinance ADB subprojects, depending \non comparative advantage, sector knowledge, and skills base.  \n \nSubject to Board approval, ADB will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the \n93. \nGovernment  and  the  World  Bank,  and  a  Contribution  Agreement  with  the  World  Bank.  The \nterms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Contribution Agreement are \nbeing formulated by ADB and the World Bank. The quarterly progress report to the Board on the \nutilization  of  the  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  will  provide  information  to  the  Board  on  progress  in  the \nutilization of MDTF and ADB\u2019s role in the MDTF. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n94. \nThe  subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  technical  feasibility,  cost-\neffectiveness,  and  contribution  to  the  economic  revival  process  in  the  affected  regions.  Given \nthe total destruction in many areas, any support is likely to bring significant incremental benefits \nto the affected population. The subprojects under  theme 1, anchored on livelihood restoration, \nwill bring significant direct benefits through immediate opportunities in agriculture and fisheries, \nsectors that account for over 60% of labor force participation in Aceh. Support for the restoration \nof  housing  assets  will  also  have  beneficial  economic  and  social  outcomes.  By  providing \nessential public services and rebuilding infrastructure, the subprojects under  theme 2 will have \nmajor direct and indirect impacts on economic revival. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty and Other Impacts \n\n95. \nPoverty  Impact.  By  contributing  to  economic  revival  and  livelihood  restoration,  the \nETESP  will  have  significant  beneficial  impacts  on  the  poor.  In  particular,  the  targeting \nmechanisms  used  will  ensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  those  with  inadequate \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nskills,  derive  adequate  support  through  the  subprojects.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy, and a gender action plan are in Appendix 8.11 \n \n96. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  This  is  a  category  B  project.  An  overall  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  to  assess  generic  impacts  of  each  project  component \n(Appendix  5).  The  IEE  shows  that  the  ETESP  will  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the \nenvironment,  including  rehabilitating  the  damaged  coastal  zones,  mangroves, and coral reefs; \nreviving  agricultural  productivity;  and  reducing  health  risks  by  rehabilitating  damaged  water \nsupply and sanitation facilities. In addition,  spatial planning and environmental management, as \na  project  component,  will  promote  mainstreaming  of  environmental  considerations  into  the \nplanning process. The IEE also shows that none of the interventions under the ETESP, at this \nstage of design, is anticipated to create any significant adverse impact on the environment, and \nthat the potential negative impact in a limited number of cases will be  localized, short-term, and \ncan be mitigated. Given the emergency nature of the Project, subproject-specific IEEs were not \nprepared,  but  will  be  developed  prior  to  physical  construction  of  the  subprojects.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure is prepared as part of the IEE (Appendix 5), to \nguide the environmental assessment of subprojects and facilitate institutional arrangements and \ncompliance with environmental requirements of Indonesia and ADB. \n \n97. \nResettlement Issues. Since the disaster has led to significant changes in the coastline, \nthe  DMRR  strategy  envisages  a  large-scale  spatial  planning  initiative,  part  of  which  will  be \nsupported by the ETESP. The more than 400,000  internally displaced people pose substantial \nchallenges  for  the  provision  of  shelter  and  livelihood  opportunities  to  the  homeless  and \norphaned, who are now temporarily living in public shelters or with relatives and host families. \nSocial  strains  are  already  evident.  The  Government\u2019s  current  plan  includes  realignment  of  the \ncoastline,  at  least  in  densely  populated  coastal  regions.  Civil  society  consultations  are  under \nway  to  disseminate  the  Government\u2019s  plan.  While  the  Government  would  prefer  decisions \nbased  on  consensus  with  community  councils  and  leaders  in  Aceh,  some  involuntary \nresettlement may be necessary. The ETESP adopts a pragmatic phased approach dealing first \nwith  urgent  needs  in  the  areas  with  low  to  medium  devastation  and  allowing  time  for  in-depth \nspatial,  environmental,  and  other  related  assessments  to  be  carried  out  prior  to  designing  the \nsubproject  interventions  under  phase  2.  Most  of  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  works \nunder  the  ETESP  are  likely  to  take  place  where  the  destroyed  or  damaged  facilities  or \ninfrastructure  were  originally  located.  Even  in  the  case  of  housing,  a  sector  where  land \nownership  issues  are  likely  to  arise,  efforts  will  be  made  to  minimize  involuntary  resettlement. \nMost  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  trigger  resettlement  safeguards.  However,  in  the  event  any \nsubproject  activity  does  trigger  such  safeguards,  BKP  and  the  concerned  IA  will  prepare  an \nappropriate  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework \n(Appendix 6) and submit it to ADB for review and approval before awarding contracts. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n98. \nETESP  implementation  involves  three  major  risks.  The  first  relates  to  the  history  of \nconflicts in Aceh. The tsunami tragedy has provided a small window of opportunity for both the \nGovernment and the Free Aceh Movement to discuss the future of Aceh.  An interim truce has \nbeen declared, and peace talks aimed at longer-term resolution have been initiated in Helsinki. \nAt the same time, reports of armed conflict and skirmishes continue. Years of hostility may take \nsignificant  efforts  and  goodwill  on  both  sides  to  be  resolved.  ADB\u2019s  past  projects  have  faced \nmajor implementation hurdles in Aceh due to the continuing conflicts. The mitigating factor is the \n\n                                                 \n11  Supplementary Appendix E presents a detailed social and poverty impact assessment of the tsunami disaster. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29 \n\nlevel of seriousness and commitment that the Government has shown in  (i) providing relief and \nhumanitarian  assistance  and  its  coordination,  (ii)  preparing  the  DMRR  strategy,  (iii)  being \nsensitive to the need for involvement of Acehnese, and  (iv) mobilizing donor commitments . The \nDMRR strategy lays out a multiyear implementation framework, and indications are strong that \nthe line ministries in a number of  key sectors will use the  DMRR support as an opportunity to \nelevate the quality of public services  in Aceh over and beyond the predisaster situation. Such \ngenuine development initiatives are expected to facilitate resumption of normalcy. \n \nThe  ETESP  design  deals  with  the  conflict  risk  by  recognizing  that  the  reconstruction \n99. \neffort  must  be  fully participatory. Conflict experience elsewhere in Indonesia demonstrates the \nimportance  of  thorough  communication  and  consultations,  prior  to  implementation.  To  restore \nhope for the future and dignity, people must be given control over their lives. To restore trust of \nlocal institutions, and nurture satisfaction with the reconstruction program, affected people need \nroom  to  participate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  reconstruction  programs. \nConsultations  with  the  community  leaders  (formal  and  informal),  local  academics,  and \ngrassroots  institutions  are  first  steps  in  that  direction,  as  they  provide  an  avenue  for  public \nparticipation and awareness, and lead to programs that meet people\u2019s needs and aspirations. At \nthe  same  time,  care  must  be  taken  not  to  raise  expectations  about  programs  and  assistance \nthat  may  not  materialize.  The  opportunities  for  participation  must  be  well  researched  and \nplanned  to  ensure  that  the  issues  raised  are  representative  for  all  segments  in  the  affected \ncommunities. \n\n100.  The  second  major  risk  relates  to  the  lack  of  capacity  at  the  local  government  levels  in \nimplementing development programs and projects. The disaster, through loss of lives of scores \nof civil servants, has aggravated the already weak  local capacity. The central Government has \nthus  far  filled  the  gap  by  sending  teams  of  experts  to  deliver  essential  public  services  in  the \nworst affected areas. The ETESP recognizes these serious problems. The capacity risk will be \nmitigated  by  including  capacity-building  support  for  local  governments  in  all  sector  and \nsubproject  interventions,  and  providing  adequate  consulting  support  for  project  management \nand implementation.  \n\n101.  The third major risk relates to coherence of implementation of the Government\u2019s DMRR \nstrategy  and  donor  coordination.  ADB  assistance  will  be  delivered  in  an  arena  with  many \norganizations  with  different  targets,  programs,  and  packages  of  assistance.  In  addition,  the \nmultiple  needs  of  reconstruction  have  different  but  overlapping  targets:  regional,  sector,  and \nindividual.  Ideally,  the  DMRR  strategy  and  its  future  revisions  should  set  out  the  principles  for \ntargeting the various schemes proposed. Without coherent principles and criteria, reconstruction \nassistance  may  induce  conflicts.  Similarly,  the  detailed  planning  of  assistance  from  ADB  and \nother donors and their eligibility criteria should be in line with whatever criteria are established \nby the Government, validated by the affected people, and well publicized. The flexible design of \nthe ETESP mitigates the risks under this category, by formulating the sector interventions in two \nphases, to allow for time and consultations with the  central and local governments and donors. \nThe subproject proposals will pass through a comprehensive assessment process, including in-\ndepth consultations with all the relevant and major institutions concerned. \n\n102. \nIn  addition,  segregation  of  women  and  the  persistence  of  gender-based discriminatory \npractices in Aceh may affect the ETESP\u2019s ability to identify the specific needs and vulnerabilities \nof women, especially widows and  female heads of households, in order to formulate adequate \nresponse.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  ETESP  components  will  support  community  organizations, \nincluding  women\u2019s  grassroots  organizations  and  networks ,  to  participate  in  local  decision-\n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nmaking  to  ensure  that  their  perspectives  are  included  in  mainstream  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction efforts. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n103. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe  policies  adopted,  mechanisms \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  executing agency  arrangements for  the \nETESP  will  be  transferred  from  BAPPENAS  to  BKP  immediately  after  the \nestablishment of BKP. \nThe  Government  will  ensure that  the  PMO  and  PMUs  are  established  with  full \ncoordination,  structural  and  reporting  arrangements  with  the  Executing Agency \noutlined, immediately following the establishment of the BKP. \nThe Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  cash  and  in-kind  assistance  provided  to \nindividual  beneficiaries  under  the  Project  will  be  against  suitable  identification \nand verification in accordance with arrangements agreed between ADB and the \nGovernment;  all  records,  receipts,  certificates ,  and  other  documents  related  to \nthe cash and in-kind assistance will be properly maintained and made available \nto ADB at any time;  and in case of support on a retroactive basis, the concerned \nline ministries, agencies, or local governments will produce clear documentation \nthe \non \nidentification process. \nThe Government will ensure that BKP and each of the line ministries (the IAs) will \nactively  seek  community  participation  in  the  subproject  design,  implementation, \noperation,  and  maintenance  of  all  works  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The \nGovernment,  through  BKP  and  the  IAs  will  engage,  to  the  extent  possible,  civil \nsociety  organizations  (CSOs)  and  NGOs  for  subproject  implementation  as  well \nas  monitoring.  Further,  to  ensure  integrity  of  CSOs/NGOs  and  to  prevent \ncollusive relations, all CSOs/NGOs engaged under the Project will be required to \npublish information about their activities and use of funds and  will be subject to \naudit. This information will be placed on a website.  \nThe Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures in \naccordance  with  (a)  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and \n(b) ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs \nand implementation. The Government will ensure that the agreed  environmental \nassessment and review procedures are complied with.  \nThe Government will ensure that the relocation of the displaced persons will be \ncompleted as per the Government\u2019s policy framework and procedural guidelines \napplicable to the Project, which are outlined in the agreed LARPFPG.  \n\nfor  delivery  of  support,  and \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  subprojects  will avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement. In the event involuntary resettlement is required for any \nsubproject, then the Government  will prepare a land acquisition and resettlement \nplan in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed LARPFPG. In case of \ndiscrepancies between the Government's laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB's  requirements,  ADB's  requirements  will  apply.  The  Land  Acquisition  and \nResettlement Plan for a subproject  will  be  submitted  to  and  approved  by  ADB \n\n\f \n\n \n\n31 \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nprior to the award of a civil works contract for that subproject. The  Resettlement \nPlan  will  be  disclosed  to  people  affected,  and  project  reporting  will  provide \ninformation on resettlement. Further, the Government  will ensure that the agreed \nLARPFPG  and  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  are  strictly  complied \nwith.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities \nhave  been  completed  before  disbursement  to  subprojects.  No  civil  works  will \ncommence  in  any  area  prior  to  completion  of  all  approved  resettlement  and \nincome restoration activities in that area. \nThe Government will ensure that to safeguard the interest of indigenous peoples, \nmeasures  are  undertaken  to  promote  full  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in \nthe Project. Subproject activities will be carried out in accordance with  the  ADB \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  in  accordance  with  the  Indigenous  Peoples \nDevelopment Framework, which has been agreed by the Government and ADB.  \nThe Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB  Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment  (1998),  (a)  adequate  resources  are  provided  to  implement  the \ngender  action  plan  developed  for  the  ETESP  and  included  in  Appendix  8;  (b) \nproject interventions take into account the different impacts and needs of women \nand  men;  (c)  special  features  are  built  into  subprojects  to  facilitate  and \nencourage  women\u2019s  participation and to ensure tangible benefits to women; (d) \nadequate  representation  is  given  to  women  in  decision-making processes and \nstructures for post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction; (e) project reporting \nreflects gender-specific issues and gender-disaggregated data, where applicable; \nand  (f)  women  will  be  eligible  for  equal  opportunities  and  pay  generated  under \nthe ETESP.  \n\n(xii)  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  spot audits at any time during \nproject implementation to determine the degree to which project funds have been \neffectively  and  efficiently  utilized  to  implement  the  ETESP  and  achieve  its \nobjectives,  outputs,  and  performance  indicators.  ADB  also  reserves  the  right to \ninvestigate  any  possible  financial  or  management  impropriety  in  conducting  the \nETESP.  The  Government  will  cooperate  with  any  such  audit  and  investigation \nand  extend  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords,  as  well  as  engagement  of  independent  auditors  and  experts  who  may \nbe  needed  for  satisfactory  completion  of  such  audits  and  investigations.  All \nexternal  costs  related  to  the  audits  and  investigations  will  be  borne  by  the \nETESP.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  a  \u201cspecial  audit\u201d  focusing  on \ngovernance; \nfinancial  accountability  (e.g.,  certification  of  accounts);  and \ntransparency soon after completion of the ETESP. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government,  through  the  PMO  and  PMUs  will,  make  available  on  the \nwebsite  for  the  ETESP  information  on  how  the  funds  are  being  used  for  the \nintended beneficiaries following applicable procedures. The website will present \nfinancial  statements  and  track  procurement  contract  awards,  and  include \ninformation  on,  among  others,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the \nwinning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  the \ncontract awarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended \nand actual utilization.  \n\n(xiv)   The Government will immediately  put  in  place  mechanisms  to  deal with citizen \ngrievance against anyone taking advantage of the situation, as well as alternative \ndispute  resolution  mechanisms  to  settle  private  disputes.  To  that  end,  within  3 \nmonths of the  effective  date, the  Government will  establish a grievance review \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nand  resolution  mechanism  within  BKP.  The  grievance  review  and  resolution \nmechanism  will  be  responsible  for  (a)  reviewing  and  addressing  grievances of \nany  citizen,  beneficiaries,  and  other  stakeholders  of  the  ETESP,  in  relation  to \neither  the  Project,  any  of  the  service  providers,  or  any  person  responsible  for \ncarrying out any aspect of the  ETESP; and (b) establishing the threshold criteria \nand  procedures  for  handling  such  grievances,  for  proactively  and  constructively \nresponding to them, and for providing the public with notice of such mechanism, \nincluding publishing notices in newspapers. Such criteria and procedures will be \nsubject to ADB\u2019s approval. The supervisory board (Badan Pengawas) of BKP will \nbe responsible for the mechanism and a dedicated full-time professional staff of \nBKP will be appointed. This staff will report directly to the head of the supervisory \nboard of BKP, who in turn will report directly to the  chief of BKP. This grievance \nreview  and  resolution  mechanism  will  be  made  public  and  a  facilitation unit  will \nbe established. The facilitation unit will be established in coordination with CSOs \nand/or NGOs. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n104. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $290,000,000  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia, from the Asian Tsunami Fund, provided that any withdrawal in excess \nof  $145,000,000  shall  be  subject  to  the  availability  of  the  Asian  Tsunami Fund \nresources,  for  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Emergency  Support  Project,  on \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe administration by ADB of  a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  to  strengthen  the  Fiduciary  Oversight  on  Disaster \nManagement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Aceh and North Sumatra to be \nprovided by the Government of Netherlands. \n\n \nI also recommend that the Board approve the contribution from the Asian Tsunami Fund \n\n105. \nof $10,000,000 to the Multidonor Trust Fund, as described in paragraphs 91-93 above. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n30 March 2005 \n \n\n\f \nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nAceh and North Sumatra affected regions \neconomically revived \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \nAgriculture and fisheries production restored \nby mid-2008 \nAverage household incomes at half pre-\ndisaster level by mid-2008 \nPrivate sector activities main component of \neconomic activity in affected areas by mid-\n2007 \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n \nProvincial statistics and \nmonitoring system  \n\nOutcome \nLivelihoods and private economic activity, and \nessential public services and infrastructure, \nrestored \n \n \n \n\n \nEmployment  opportunities for one person in \nevery household by end 2006 \nFull enrollment of school children by end \n2007 \nWater\u2013borne diseases reduced by mid-2008 \nViable transport enterprises operating by \nend-2006. \n\n \nProvincial statistical sources \n \nProject performance monitoring  \nsystem (PPMS) \n\nOutputs \n1.

The first phase districts (Aceh Besar, Aceh Utara, Bireuen, Nias, and Pidie) \nwill include those where the majority of the communities in the affected areas are intact and the \ndistrict  implementation  capacities  are  not  severely  affected.  The  sec ond  phase  will  focus  on \ndistricts where sizable damage has occurred, but need preparatory activities such as restoration \nof accessibility, spatial planning, return of communities from the refugee camps, and restoration \nof  some  implementation  capacity  (Aceh  Barat,  Aceh  Barat  Daya,  Aceh  Jaya,  Aceh  Timur, \nNagan Raya, and Simelue). \n \n2. \nRestoration of Support Services. The impact of the tsunami on the agricultural support \nservices has been extensive with the loss of trained staff and damage to facilities, equipment, \nand vehicles. To help the recovery of farming, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support \nagriculture-related  human  resources  and  institutional  development  of  district  and  provincial \ngovernments  in  the  project  area.  Drawing  on  previous  ADB  and  other  assisted  projects  in  the \ncountry, the component will help to (i) introduce extension methodologies, such as participatory \nfarmer  field  schools  and  farmer  driven  research,  which  have  proven  to  be  effective  in \ntransferring technology to farmers, and (ii) facilitate speedy recovery of farming practice. \n \n3. \nThe  activities  include  (i)  capacity-building  of  institutions  and  human  resources;  (ii) \nrecruitment of agricultural graduates, preferably belonging to the affected areas, on contractual \nbasis  that  may  later  be  absorbed  by  the  district  and  provincial  governments  into  their  regular \ncadres;  (iii)  training  of  250  new  and  350  existing  staff  in  the  participatory  extension \nmethodologies, land-use planning, crop production, and remedial measures for salinization and \nother tsunami-related issues; and (iv) rehabilitation of key agricultural facilities, and provision of \nnecessary equipment and vehicles. \n \n4. \nCommunity  Empowerment.  Experience  with  past  and  ongoing  projects  is  that  the \nformation  and  development  of  self-help  groups  is  highly  effective  in  building  coherent \ncommunities  and  enabling  community  members  to  rise  out  of  poverty.  In  select  areas,  the \ncomponent will support working with community members to revive the communities and build \ntheir capacities to undertake the recovery process with community participation. The community \nneeds  and  capabilities  will  be  assessed  at  the  initial  stages  to  provide  a  basis  for  targeting \ninterventions. Revival and empowerment of the communities into self-help groups will also help \nthe communities access reconstruction initiatives offered by the Government or other donors.  \n \n5. \nThe  component  will  (i)  develop  2,000  self-help  groups,  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  4,000 \ncommunity members in community management skills,; (iii) develop participatory land and asset \nownership mapping, (iv) undertake a needs and capability assessment, (v) establish community \nmicrofinance  services,  (vi)  provide  training  in  alternate  income  generation  skills,  and  (vii) \nsupport  communities  to  reestablish  land  ownership  records.  The  component  will  specifically \ntarget households headed by women and orphans to ensure that their interests are protected. \n \n6. \nRestoration  of  Farming.  Damage  to  farmland,  supporting  infrastructure,  and  farming \nassets  has  been  extensive.  Depending  on  the  extent  of  damage,  restoration  of  productive \nactivities  to  pre-tsunami  levels  may  take  from  6\u20138  months  to  3\u20134  years.  The  component  will \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nprovide  for  studies  to  assess  the  extent  of  damage  in  different  areas  and  develop  different \nrestoration  strategies  for  different  levels  of  damage.  Less-affected  areas  may  require  the \nclearing  of  debris  from  farmland,  and  provision  of  basic  tools,  equipment,  crop  inputs,  poultry, \nand  small  ruminants.  Regions  with  moderate  damage  may  require  desalinization  and  soil \nimprovement measures, desiltation of farm irrigation and drainage channels, and introduction of \nsalt-tolerant  crops/varieties.  Regions  sustaining  heavy  damage,  in  addition  to  the  activities \nrequired for the less and moderate damage areas, may require land leveling, new field layouts, \nand realignment of irrigation and drainage infrastructure.  \n \n7. \nThe restoration strategies in the moderate and heavily damaged areas will need studies \nand  close  backstopping  to  initiate  and  guide  the  implementation,  and  monitor  the  progress.  In \nparticular, close monitoring will be needed in monitoring the salinity levels in soil and water and \nin adaptability of salt tolerant crops to the local conditions. \n \n8. \nThe  component  will  provide  for  (i)  studies  to  profile  the  damage  and  development  of \nrestoration  strategies  for  different  levels  of  damage;  (ii)  participatory  land  use  planning  in  the \nsettlements represented by 2,000 self-help groups; (iii) training for 2,000 self-help groups in the \nproduction of field crops, tree crops, and horticulture crops; (iv) rehabilitation on 20,000 hectares \n(ha)  of  farmland;  (v)  soil  improvement  and  desalinization  on  6,000  ha  of  farmland;  (vi)  land \nleveling  on  5,000  ha  of  severely  damaged  farmland;  (vii)  farmer-driven  research;  (viii)  seed \nmultiplication  for  salt-tolerant  crops  and  varieties;  (ix)  support  for  resumption  of  field  crop \nproduction  on  15,000  ha;  (x)  community-based  nurseries  for  tree  crops;  (xi)  support  for \nimproving  15,000  ha  of  tree  crops;  (xii)  support  to  2,000  self-help group for poultry and small \nruminants; and (xiii) monitoring of soil improvement including salinity levels in the soil and water \nin the areas receiving moderate to heavy damage. \n \n\nb. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe estimated costs of the component are about $32.7 million equivalent (Table A2.1), \n9. \nof  which  $8.5  million  represents  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $24.2  million  equivalent  local \ncurrency costs. ADB will provide $30 million to cover $8.5 million in foreign exchange and $21.5 \nmillion  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $2.71  million \nequivalent. \n \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsulting  services,  both  international  and  domestic,  will  be  required  in  the  fields  of \n10. \nhuman \nresource  development,  participatory  extension  methodologies,  soil  science, \ndesalinization  and  soil  improvement,  land-use  planning,  community  development,  agronomy, \ntree crops, and civil engineering. The component will require 135 person-months of consulting \nservices:  60  international  and  100  domestic.  Furthermore,  it  will  require  the  services  of \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) for community empowerment activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nTable A2.1: Cost Estimates for the Agriculture Subcomponent  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nCommunity Mobilization \nTraining \nTrials and Demonstrations \nStudies and Assessments \nVehicles \nEquipment and Materials \nCivil Works  \n     Farmland Rehabilitation \n     Facilities \nConsulting Services \nPPMS and Audits \nImplementation and \nSupervision \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n1.06 \n0.55 \n0.03 \n0.21 \n0.30 \n2.23 \n \n1.44 \n0.43 \n1.51 \n0.10 \n \n0.67 \n8.53 \nPPMS = project performance monitoring system.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n2. \n\nFisheries \n\na. \n\nScope \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n3.19 \n1.65 \n0.10 \n0.64 \n0.38 \n7.59 \n \n4.80 \n1.85 \n0.80 \n0.29 \n \n2.89 \n24.18 \n\nTotal \nCost \n4.25 \n2.20 \n0.13 \n0.85 \n0.68 \n9.83 \n \n6.24 \n2.27 \n2.31 \n0.39 \n \n3.56 \n32.71 \n\nPhase I \n1.89 \n0.95 \n0.06 \n0.45 \n0.28 \n4.76 \n \n2.92 \n1.37 \n0.82 \n0.17 \n \n1.60 \n15.27 \n\nPhase II \n2.36 \n1.25 \n0.07 \n0.40 \n0.40 \n5.07 \n \n3.32 \n0.90 \n1.49 \n0.22 \n \n1.96 \n17.44 \n\n11. \nThe  fisheries  component  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.

Aceh\u2019s  economy  was  dominated  mainly  by  family-owned firms, \n20. \nmany small and most operating outside the formal economy. Most Acehnese households relied \non  agriculture  or  fishing  as  their  main  source  of  income.  According  to  the  national  statistics \nservice,  only  65  establishments  classified  as  medium  or  large-sized  firms  were  operating  in \n2002. The statistics service\u2019s 2002 survey on small informal business estimated that Aceh had \n187,996 micro and small enterprises, each employing an average of 1.8 people. About 80,000 \nof these businesses have been lost, generating job losses of approximately 140,000.  \n \nFinancial  Sector  of  Aceh.  Prior to the disaster, the financial sector comprised mainly \n21. \ncommercial  banks,  a  provincial  development  bank  (Bank  BPD  Aceh),  and  small  financial \ninstitutions, most notably 20 rural development banks (BPRs). In the provincial capital of Banda \nAceh,  10  commercial  banks  were  operating,  including  Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI),  Bank \nMandiri, and Bank Danamon. Some half dozen insurance companies operating in  Aceh, served \nmainly  larger  businesses.  BRI  (130  offices)  and  Bank  BPD  Aceh  (38  offices)  had  extensive \noperations  outside  of  Banda  Aceh  and  these  two  banks  accounted  for  73%  of  the  provincial \ncredit  outstanding,  which  amounted  to  approximately  Rp2.6  trillion  ($339  million).2 Prior to the \ntsunami,  BPD  Aceh  had  a  loan  portfolio  of  slightly  more  than  Rp1  trillion  ($122  million) \nrepresenting  more  than  39%  of  total  lending  within  Aceh.  State  and  privately  owned  banks \ncombined accounted for Rp1.8 billion in loans ($213 million), about 63% of total Aceh lending. \nBRI,  with  $126  million3  in  total  loans,  had  the  largest  share.  BPRs\u2019  combined  lending  of  Rp35 \nbillion ($4.1 million), amounted to 1.2% of total Aceh credit.  \n \n22. \nHalf of commercial bank loans outstanding as of 26 December 2004 in Aceh equivalent \nto $100 million are subject to write-off, though this figure will ultimately be adjusted downward, \nas  credit  life  insurance  was  widely  in  use.  Infrastructure  losses  and  damage  to  records are \nestimated  as  high  as  Rp130  billion.  Six  BPRs  have  been  completely  wiped  out:  offices \ndestroyed  along  with  records,  high  staff  casualties,  and  devastation  to  their  service  area. \nCumulative  losses  of  BPRs  and  BPD  is  about  50%  of  their  portfolios  and  greater  than  their \ncombined  capital.  Both  the  local  BPRs  and  the  BPD  lack  back-up  lines  of  credit  or  liquidity \nfacilities  that  they  could  draw  on  to  restart  lending  operations.  The  BPRs  are  in  a  difficult \nsituation,  as  their  deposits  are  being  drawn  down  by  customers.  Only the BPD has resumed \nlending on any scale. BRI has not yet resumed normal lending and has declared a \u201crepayment \nholiday\u201d  to  be  in  effect  through  the  end  of  March.  Most  enterprise  borrowers  are  unlikely  to \nbegin  repaying  until  BRI  has  worked  out  restructuring/refinance  plans  with  them.  BRI  has \nannounced that it expects to write off Rp400 billion ($47 million), equivalent to virtually the entire \ncombined portfolios of three BRI branches (and the units they supervise) destroyed. \n \n23. \nfew  community-based  microfinance \ninstitutions4 existed in the tsunami-affected areas, and these appear to have been largely wiped \nout.  Prior  to  the  disaster,  low  cash  and  capital  reserves,  geographic  concentration,  and  often, \ninadequate support and supervision worked against the development of grassroots institutions. \nADB  will  support  establishment  of  new  grassroots  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  which  will \nrequire  sustained \nfor  capacity  building.  Post-tsunami,  however, \ncompassion  could  interfere  with  the  establishment  of  sustainable  grassroots  institutions:  soft \n                                                 \n2   All figures are for 30 September 2004, provided by Bank Indonesia to the ADB mission 2\u20133 March 2005. \n3   Figure is an extrapolation from BI data. More complete figures have been requested from BRI. \n4   No reliable statistics are available documenting the various village savings and credit associations and funds that \nwere operating, some under the auspices of imams, others of local government leaders. A seed capital grant has \nbeen approved from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to undertake a survey and evaluation of these MFIs.  \n \n\nCommunity-Based  Microfinance .  Relatively \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nloans  and  grants,  poisonous  to  institutional  sustainability,  are  often  mentioned  as  appropriate \n\u201cproducts\u201d for community MFIs to distribute. The damage and loss assessment was quite clear \nabout  the  need  to  avoid  using  MFIs \u2014or  any  formal  financial  institution  for  that  matter\u2014as \nconduits  for  subsidized  lending  or  grants.  ADB  has  fully  supported  this  approach,  also \nadvocated by Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, which just released a set of principles to \nguide  microfinance  operations  under  crisis  conditions.  In  contributions  to  working  group \ndiscussion with the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), ADB has urged that \ngrants be provided to individuals and microenterprises; this is the most useful and immediately \npractical  way  to  provide  the  means  to  restore  income-generating assets. Financial support for \nmicro, small, and medium-size  enterprises  should,  therefore,  include  grants.  The  key  issue  is \nhow to create a mechanism to distribute grants efficiently and equitably. \n \nAt the same time, internally displaced people appear to have a strong nominal (though \n24. \nperhaps  not  always  effective)  demand  for  micro  loans  as  a  key  part  of  restarting  economic \nactivities.  ADB  proposes,  via  an  accompanying  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant,  to \nsupport  the  development  of  grassroots  MFIs,  e.g.,  savings  and  credit  associations.  These \nvillage-based MFIs will not play a large role in providing financial support initially for restoration \nmicro and small enterprises. In the medium to long run, however, as capacity is developed, their \nrole  in  supporting  micro  and  small  enterprises  will  grow.  ADB  has  a  unique  opportunity  to \ncombine efforts with other development partners to build these village-based MFIs, as well as to \nprovide  overall  technical  leadership.  Numerous  relief  agencies  operating  in  Aceh  have \nsignificant  microfinance  experience  (including,  World  Vision,  Save  the  Children,  Mercy  Corps, \nOxfam,  Catholic  Relief  Services),  but  less  scope  for  developing  projects  directly  with  the \ngovernment.  A  tremendous  amount  of  grant  resources  controlled  by  these  organizations  are \navailable to pay for social intermediation and capacity building. ADB\u2019s role will be to provide the \nframework,  along  with  technical  assistance,  within  which  these  agencies  can  apply  best \npractices to microfinance.  \n \n\nb. \n\nScope \n\n25. \nSupport  to Commercial Microfinance   System.  BPRs  and  other  MFIs  will  be  able  to \nsecure  funds  for  onlending  to  MSEs  from  a  microfinance  fund.  Technical  assistance  to  BPRs \nand  other  MFIs  will  be  provided  in  the  area  of  operations,  product  design,  financial \nmanagement, accounting, and auditing. Substantial assistance to a limited number of BPRs will \nlikely be forthcoming from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW-GTZ)5  and  ADB  will  also  support  surviving  BPRs,  as  many  have \nborrowed from ADB under the Microcredit Project.6 The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant \nproject will concentrate on developing village-based savings and credit associations and provide \ntechnical  assistance  for  capacity  building  to  these  grassroots  MFIs.  Funding  requirements of \nthese MFIs will be provided for via the microfinance fund, which will provide mainly short-term, \nbut in some cases also long-term, loans. The microfinance fund may also be made available to \nother  financial  providers  seeking  to  serve  micro  and  small  enterprises  with  microfinance \nproducts, including BPD.  \n \nInnovation  Fund.  An  innovation  fund  will  provide  long-term  debt  and/or  equity  for  (i) \n26. \ndemonstrably viable financial institutions seeking to restore and expand their operations in the \nprovince  but  short  of  investment  capital,  or  (ii)  new  financial  institutions,  e.g.,  a  leasing \ncompany. This fund will support financial innovations, and promote investment in new financial \n                                                 \n5   BPR liquidity needs are estimated from Rp25 billion\u201340 billion ($2.8million\u20134.4 million). Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW-GTZ), GTZ-KfW is proposing to provide E6 \nmillion for a project that would support 5 BPRs  \n\n6   ADB. 1994.

Some Sharia-based financial institutions are operating, though on a small scale; utilizing \nand expanding this risk-sharing financial modality appears worthwhile. Sharia leasing is a new \nconcept  and  appears  to  offer  promise  as  a  way  of  financing  small-scale  equipment  leasing \nneeded  by  existing  and  new  micro,  small,  and  medium-size  enterprises.  Local  financial \ninstitutions that demonstrate fundamental soundness may be allowed to borrow longer term to \nfinance capital expenditures, including investments in new service technologies. \n \n27. \nCreating  a  Technical  Support  Unit.  The  project  activities  will  be  managed  by  a \ntechnical  support  unit,  comprising  a  team  of  financial  experts,  both  local  and  international, \nsupported  by  highly  experienced  local  administrative  staff,  including  legal,  accounting,  and \nauditing experts. This team will provide technical assistance to financial institutions, and guide \nday-to-day activities of the microfinance fund and innovation fund. \n \n\nc. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n28. \nEstimated component costs are about $21.30 million equivalent (Table A2.3), with $3.73 \nmillion representing direct foreign exchange costs and $17.57 million equivalent local currency \ncosts. ADB will finance $21 million  equivalent comprising $3.73 million in foreign exchange and \n$17.27 million equivalent in local currency.

The \ncomponent will require a total of 109 person-months of consulting services: 63 international and \n65 domestic.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Services \n\n1. \n\nHealth \n\na. \n\nScope \n\n \n\n30. \nThe health component has two broad objectives: (i) improve access to basic health care \nfor the vulnerable and the underserved, and (ii) improve efficiency of the health delivery system. \nConcentrating  on  the  population  needs  of  remote  and  underserved  districts  where  the  most \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nvulnerable reside, the component comprises four subcomponents focusing on strengthening (i) \nprimary health care, (ii) district health service delivery, and (iii) health management.   \n \n31. \nFormulating  a  Strategic  Plan.  Before  initiating  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nactivities,  a  strategic  plan  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  health  services  will  provide \nguidance on effective approaches for health service delivery. The plan would address the most \nacute health needs, identifies challenges faced by the public sector, and assess strengths and \ncomplementary  support  offered  by  NGOs  and  the  private  sector.  It  will  help  the  government \ndevelop a health system that demonstrates improved efficiency and effectiveness. A description \nof the three main subcomponents follows. \n \n32. \nStrengthening Primary Health Care. The component will adopt various approaches to \nstrengthen facility-based and outreach services for primary health care, especially to reach the \ndisplaced and underserved population. The focus will be on districts where human capital loss is \nsevere. Different approaches (such as contracting of services) and involvement of community-\nbased  organizations  will  be  adopted  to  maximize  the  use  of  health  personnel  from  the  public \nand private sector, and from NGOs. In districts where human capital loss is not that severe, the \npublic sector's capacity for primary health care service provision will be augmented by deploying \ntrained  personnel.  The  component  will  rehabilitate  15\u201320  primary  health  care  facilities7  in \ncoastal and interior areas, and finance public health interventions that reduce the incidence of \ncommunicable  disease.  Outreach  activities  will  be  conducted  through  mobile  clinics,  and \nexisting community-based health service mechanisms will be supported. \n\n \n33. \nStrengthening  District  Health  Service  Delivery.  The  component  will  develop  an \nintegrated provincial master plan to support an efficient and rationalized health service delivery \nnetwork.  It  will  rehabilitate  2\u20133  district  hospitals  in  Aceh  Barat,  Aceh  Jaya,  and  Banda  Aceh \nreequip  them  with  essential  health  care  packages,  provide  mobile  logistical  support,  and  build \nhuman resource capacity). The component  will support short-term  training  for  newly  deployed \nstaff and help build capacity in continuing education and refresher training programs for existing \nhealth  care  personnel,  especially  for  nurses  and  midwives.  All  staff  working  in  the  public  and \nprivate health sectors will be eligible for these training programs. \n \nStrengthening  Health  Management.  The  component  will  strengthen  provincial  and \n34. \ndistrict  health  sector  planning,  coordination,  and  management;  build  capacity  for  human \nresource  planning  and  development;  streamline  payment  and  risk-sharing  mechanisms  to \nsupport the poor, the underserved, and the displaced; improve budget management to allow for \nsufficient  recurrent  costs;  and  improve  financial  management  and  accounting  systems.  The \ncomponent will develop mechanisms to allow for public-private partnerships in service delivery, \ntraining,  and  monitoring.  In  addition,  a  district health monitoring system will be established for \nquality  assurance,  and  independent  third  party  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  health  service \ndelivery will be initiated. \n \n\nb. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nOf  the  estimated  component  cost  of  $25.3  million  equivalent,  foreign  exchange  costs \n35. \nrepresent  $10.20  million  and  local  currency  costs  $15.1  million  equivalent.

MOH will recruit international and domestic consultants. Direct selection may be used for \nconsultants  on  an  individual  basis  or  through  a  firm.  Overall,  15  international  (75  person-\nmonths)  and  30  domestic  (150  person-months)  consultants  will  be  recruited,  specializing  in \nhealth  systems,  health  financing  and  management,  logistical  management,  information \nmanagement,  human  resource  development,  public  health,  maternal  and  child  health,  district \nhospitals,  engineering,  community  development,  and  project  implementation.  The  component \nwill  carry  out  a  wide  range  of  provincial  and  district  training  programs,  and  identify  potential \ntraining institutions for clinical practice training and management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation and Skills Development \n\na. \n\nScope \n\n37. \nThe Project will cover repair and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure at all levels of \neducation,  including  furniture,  equipment,  and  teaching  materials;  and  training  and  salaries  of \nnew teaching staff and education managers. The Project will also provide skills training to out-\nof-school  youth  to  prepare  them  for  entry  into  the  labor  market,  and  to  adults  who  need \nretraining  because  they  have  lost  their  livelihood.  The  Project  will  provide  $21  million  in  grant \nfunding.  \n \n38. \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation of Physical Facilities. Schools and madrasah that \nhave  been  destroyed  or  heavily  damaged  will  be  rebuilt  or  refurbished  through  the  use  of \ncontractors. Sites will be selected in consultation with district and central governments. Schools \nwith light damage will be given block grants to undertake the repairs or construction of individual \nclassrooms. The school/madrasah principal as chair of the school committee will be responsible \nfor  managing  the  rehabilitation  of  the  buildings  and  provision  of  furniture  according  to \ngovernment  specifications.  Provision  will  be  made  for  the  supply  of  lost  or  damaged  teaching \nmaterials, including a basic set of textbooks, some supplementary and reference materials, and \nlost  or  damaged  equipment  (such  as  play  and  sports  equipment,  simple  science  and \nmathematics  equipment,  computers  for  students  and  the  school  administration,  and  industrial \nand vocational training equipment for the skills development courses and vocational schools).  \n  \n39. \nTraining  of  Teaching  Staff  and  Education  Managers.  The  replacement  of  school \nteachers  is  urgent  to  allow  the  resumption  of  normal  schooling  as  quickly  as  possible.  The \nsubcomponent  will  support  (i)  redeployment  of  existing  trained  teachers  to  tsunami-affected \nareas on a voluntary basis for a specified period of time; (ii) recruitment of trained teachers who \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nin-service \n\nfrom  universities, \n\nwere  not  previously  working  as  teachers,  on  contract;  (iii)  recruitment  and  training  of  other \ngraduate professionals as teachers; and (iv) identification, recruitment, and training of local high \nschool  graduates \ntraining  colleges,  district \nthe  provincial \ngovernments, or other private contractors as teachers.  \n \n40. \nAs  the  effective  rehabilitation  of  schools  and  madrasah  will  require  the  presence  of \npeople  with  management  skills,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  and  provision  of  a \ntraining  program  for  new  principals  and  managers,  offered  through  the  universities,  provincial \ntraining  colleges,  or  other  private  contractors.  The  Project  will  also  support  salary  and  other \ncosts  for  contracted  principals,  to  be  recruited  and  appointed  in  accordance  with  standards \nestablished by the Ministry of National Education.  \n \nSkills Development. Many people in Aceh have lost their jobs as a result of businesses, \n41. \nshops, and offices being wiped out or closing, or have lost their livelihoods through loss of land \nor  means  of  productions  (e.g.,  boats).  Young  people  who  are  about  to  enter  the  labor  market \nare unprepared for the current situation. To provide as many people as possible with access to \nemployment  opportunities,  the  Project  will  support  short  nonformal  and  vocational  training  in \ncritical  areas  of  skills  development.  Skill  training  is  most  likely  to  be  needed  in  areas  like \ncarpentry,  welding,  masonry,  and  electrical  installation;  and  in  fields  appropriate  for  setting  up \nsmall enterprises (e.g., tailoring, food preparation, trading). The courses will deliver basic skills \nthat will allow people access to the labor market, and provide a basis for further training.  \n \n42. \n \n\nThese programs may be delivered in one of the following ways: \n\nNonformal  courses  offered  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  in  life  skills \ntraining  such  as  electronics,  sewing,  computer \ntraining,  hair  dressing, \nconstruction, furniture making, fishing, and cooking. The courses are 1\u20133 weeks, \ncovering  1\u20132  competency  units.  The  focus  will  be  on  about  20,000  internally \ndisplaced  people  living  in  the  new  relocation  sites,  and  working  in  collaboration \nwith  NGOs  and  other  vocational  training  institutions.  The  needs  of  the  specific \ncommunities will be identified before the courses are developed. \n\nThe skills training center run by the Ministry of Manpower was not damaged by \nthe  tsunami,  and  the  International  Labour  Organization  has  already  recruited  a \nnumber  of  experts  to  assist  in  training  (although  more  are  needed).  Courses \noffered  are  in  traditional  vocational  areas,  including  electrical,  automotive, \nwoodworking,  carpentry,  tailoring,  and  food  preparation.  The  center  will  be \nsupported to expand its operation with additional instructors, materials, operating \ncosts, and to a limited degree with equipment.  \n\nSome  of  the  senior  secondary  vocational  schools  are  still  operational,  while \nothers  will  be  repaired  with  project  support  or  other  sources.  These  schools \nprovide  community  courses  out-of-school  hours,  and  support  could  be  given to \nincrease their coverage and scope in key vocational training areas. \n\n  \n43. \nThe  detailed  program,  specifying  the  skills  to  be  offered,  to  whom,  where,  and  at  what \nlevel will be developed during the Project. One central agency should ensure that content of the \noffered  training  programs  is  consistent,  and  that  a  common  certification  system  is  in  place  to \nallow trainees to build on the competencies mastered.  \n  \n44. \nUniversities  Recovery  Program.  Universities  have  suffered  severe  losses  among \nacademic  and  management  staff.  A  targeted  program  of  support  to  help  universities  recover \nfrom this loss of valuable human resources will be developed during the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \n45. \nSubprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  education  and  training  needs,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  strategy,  and  spatial  planning  requirements. \nEducational rehabilitation and reconstruction will be prioritized according to selection criteria to \nbe prepared by the consultants and the Executing Agency in agreement with ADB. \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nc. \n \n\n46. \nThe total cost required for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of educational facilities is \nestimated  at  $22.4  million  equivalent  comprising  $4.8  million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$17.6  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (Table  A2.5).  The  cost  estimates  cover \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  educational  buildings,  teaching  materials,  equipment, \ntraining of teachers and education managers, skills development programs, university recovery, \nconsulting services, studies, and project management. ADB will finance a total amount of $21 \nmillion  comprising  $4.8  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $16.2  million  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency.

The  component  gives  priority  to  urban  or  peri-urban \nareas, but can also be implemented in rural areas.  \n \n52. \nThe component will provide the core housing units, which are expandable through self-\nhelp or by employing low-skilled labor, and include (i) some antiseismic capacity and safeguards \nfor antiseismic behavior for subsequent house expansions; (ii) the use of environmental friendly, \npreferably  locally  available  and  renewable  building  materials,  and  establishment  of  building \nmaterial  depots  to  facilitate  cheaper  bulk  supply  of  materials.  The  water  and  sanitation \nsubcomponent use appropriate low-cost decentralized water and sanitation technologies, which \ncan be manufactured on-site and are easy to operate and maintain. It will also identify off-site \ninfrastructure  requirements,  connectors  and  mains,  and  bulk  water  supply  and  treatment \nsystems.  Infrastructure  for  the  support  of  livelihood  activities  and  for  local  economic \ndevelopment  will  be  constructed  where  necessary.  The  component  will  utilize  only  sites  for \nwhich  land  titles  are  available  or  tenure  status  is  being  assured,  but  will  include  support  for \nestablishing alternative land ownership forms, instruments of land consolidation (pooling and re-\nadjustment) and retitling.

A central \nproject management unit has been established for Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject  implementation  within  the  Directorate  General  of  Housing and Settlements, which can \nbe expanded for the requirements of this housing component.  \n \nParticipating  cities  and  regencies  are  expected  to  formulate  administrative  procedures \n56. \nfor fast-track administration (single window approach) of land titling (where necessary), building \npermits  and  other  licenses  or  permits,  as  required.  Each  participating  community  will  set  up  a \ncommunity  implementation  team  to  ensure  full  involvement  of  the  community  in  all  project-\nrelated activities following the procedures developed under the Urban Poverty Project.11  \n \n57. \nIn accordance with the common housing delivery mechanism all over Indonesia, in Aceh \nand North Sumatra the delivery of project housing\u2014both housing repairs as well as construction \nof new housing\u2014will be through two modalities, namely (i) self-help housing or aided self-help \nhousing,  supported  by  skilled  labor;  and  (ii)  small  contractor  built  housing,  supervised  by  the \ncommunity  implementation  team.12  Both  these  modalities  have  a  proven  track  record  as  the \nmain  source  of  housing  produced  locally,  and  will  offer  positive  economic  spin-off effects and \nlivelihood  support  for  community  members  who  are  gainfully  employed  in  construction  work \n(cash for work system). \n \n58. \nThe  construction  industry  is  expected  to  experience  a  significant  revival  through  the \nProject, which will establish a continuous demand for materials and labor. Parallel efforts of the \nAustralian Agency for  International  Development  and  Ministry  of  Public  Works  to  develop  the \nconstruction  materials  industry  in  Aceh  will  supplement  the  Project  and  help  to  ensure  the \ndelivery of the housing program. \n \n59. \nConcerning social equity (para. 2), the Government has pronounced its policy to provide \na  housing  grant  to  all  affected  families.  The  selection  of  beneficiaries  will  be  handled  by  the \n\n                                                 \n11   These  community  participation  practices  are  similar  to  those  in  the  ADB  supported  Community  and  Local \nGovernment Support Project.

The component will \nbe implemented in two phases: phase 1: restoration of irrigation facilities to 24,300 ha along the \nnorth-east coast in Aceh and  1,300 ha in  North Sumatra and a preparatory survey and design \nworks  for  rehabilitating  7,000  ha  in  the  heavily  damaged  areas  in  the  west  coast  of  Aceh \nprovince;  and  phase  2:  rehabilitation  works  for  7,000  ha  in  the  west  coast  area  of  Aceh \nprovince,  and  water  users  training  and  community  empowerment  in  all  the  project-assisted \nirrigation  areas.  The  component  will  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami  and/or  earthquake \ndamaged  irrigation  infrastructure  by  providing  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and \nconsulting  services  for  topographic  surveys,  detailed  engineering  design,  implementation, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation, and community empowerment/training.  The proposed  activities will \nrestore  the  original  function  of  the  damaged  facilities;  no  improvement  of  infrastructure and \nfacilities over previous design is envisaged. \n \n\nb. \n\nScheme  Selection Criteria \n\n62. \nIn  addition  to  the  general  selection  criteria, priority will be given to  schemes that meet \nthe following criteria: (i) most of the beneficiaries identified, (ii) land owners identified, (iii) high \npoverty incidence, (iv) presence of active water users associations, and (v) of stakeholders and \nbeneficiaries  active  in  planning  and  implementation.

It  will  make  available  the  necessary  technical  and \nfinancial  support  required  for  acquisition  and  thematic  analysis  of  spatial  information  for  (i) \nestablishing  comprehensive  community  plans  and  (ii)  detailed site planning in selected priority \nareas.  Outputs  for  detailed  site  planning  (to  be  based  upon  additional  surveys  if  deemed \nnecessary)  will  include  (i)  location  of  critical  infrastructure  and  settlements,  (ii)  proposed \ngreenbelts,  (iii)  access  routes  to  assembly  points  providing  shelter  in  case  of  hazards  in \nsettlement  areas;  (iv)  landscape  architectural  design  for  settlement  areas,  (v)  detailed  land \nsuitability  assessments  for  specific  issues,  and  (vi)  review  of  land  ownership  and  land \nsettlement  requirements.  Detailed  maps  with  descriptions  on  suggested  land  use  will  be \ndeveloped,  taking  into  account  legal  requirements  including  restrictions,  economic  incentives, \nand  guidelines  for  construction,  as  well  as  other  socioeconomic  and  cultural  considerations \nincluding the Project\u2019s resettlement framework. This subcomponent as well as subcomponent 3 \nwill provide spatial information for social services delivery, livelihood support, and infrastructure \nrehabilitation activities. \n \n74.  Where appropriate, site locations cannot be identified; specific building code criteria will \nbe  established  to  render  key  facilities  less  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  In  cases  where  a \ncoastal green buffer zone is being considered, fishers may require continued access to the sea. \nAppropriate  site  selection  and  building  codes  for  the  installation  of  support  facilities,  such  as \nfish-landing sites, will be essential for this. \n \n\nf. \n\nCommunity Participation in Planning \n\n75. \nThe  effectiveness  of  zoning  and  regional  spatial  planning  depends  on  acceptance  and \nparticipation of the local residents. Through public consultation processes, to be initiated at the \nearliest possible stage, the communities will be provided with an opportunity to review/respond \nto the proposed overall spatial/zonation plans. This will ensure that the design of spatial plans \nincorporates  the  opinions  of  resource  users  and  coastal  communities,  and  empowers  the \nvarious  stakeholders  to  participate  in  establishing  the  detailed  community  plans.  Extensive \npublic education and awareness-building activities will include environmental awareness training \nand the establishment of local ordinances to conserve and manage natural resources.  \n \n76. \nCommunity facilitators will assist the community in voicing concerns, if any, with respect \nto the spatial/zonation plan to the planning agencies and in developing alternative options and \nsolutions.  They  may  play  a  key  role  in  mediation  on  the  plan,  as  well as on  potential conflicts \nover  land  ownership/land  titles  in  some  affected  areas.  Appropriate  conflict  resolution \nmechanisms will be put in place. \n \n \n \n77. \nThe  ETESP  will  (i)  assist  the  relevant  government  agencies  in  designing  an  efficient \nsystem for the disposal of waste and debris in the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in \nan  environmentally  friendly  manner;  (ii)  assist  in  establishing  a  coordinated  institutional \narrangement  for  such  disposal;  (iii)  provide  training  to  the  relevant  government  agencies  in \nefficient  management  of  waste  and  debris  disposal;  and  (iv)  design  an  environmentally  sound \nsystem for waste and debris clean up that the ETESP sub-components can adopt. \n \n\nManagement of Waste Disposal \n\ng. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n55 \n\nh. \n\nComponent Phasing/Packaging \n\n78. \nThe  project  design  will  follow  a  phased  approach.  The  highest  financial  investment  in \nrelative terms in phase I has been estimated for subcomponent 3 (Table A.2.9): Because spatial \nanalysis and zoning has overall high priority as it is of critical importance as an input for other \nsubcomponents,  it  will  be  quickly  pursued.  All  subcomponents  are  required  to  start \nimplementation  in  the  early  project  stages.  Subcomponent  1  will  gradually  shift  its  focus  from \npersonnel  replacement \nterm. \nSubcomponent  2  will  gradually  shift  its  focus  from  urgently  required  baseline  survey  type \nassessments  toward  detailed  environmental  assessments  for  environmental  compliance  of \nproject components. Activities related to community participation and area and site planning for \nreconstruction will be initiated as early as feasible but are expected to peak in phase 2, due to \nexpected delays in the overall reconstruction process. \n \n\ntoward  capacity-building  activities  oriented \n\nlong \n\nthe \n\nto \n\ni. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total component cost is estimated at $15.5 million equivalent comprising $6.0 million \n79. \nin foreign exchange and $9.5 million equivalent in local currency (Table A2.9).

This  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for \nensuring  that  the  funds  utilized  for  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  phase  are  utilized \neffectively  and  consistently  with  international  fiduciary  standards.  Funds  for  the  tsunami \nreconstruction and rehabilitation effort are likely to be channeled in a variety of ways, including a \nmultidonor  trust  fund.  The  Government  is  acutely  aware  that  to  ensure  that  the  commitments \nfrom the donor community are realized into actual contributions, it must present a clear strategy \non the fiduciary arrangements to the donor community. Given the history of fiduciary weakness \nin Indonesia this issue has to be tackled on a number of fronts. \n \n92. \nFor this purpose, ADB proposes to leverage its technical advantage in the area of public \nfinancial  management  utilizing  the  analyses  and  knowledge  gained  during  the  processing  of \nboth  the  recently  approved  State  Audit  Reform  (STAR)  Sector  Development  Project17 and the \ntechnical assistance grant provided to build capacity of the Anticorruption Commission (KPK).18 \nSupport is focused on the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK), which is expected to take the lead on \nthe overall fiduciary arrangements as the external audit of the Government. BPK will coordinate \nwith  the  Government  through  the  proposed  Aceh  Reconstruction  Implementation  Coordination \nBoard  (BP-R2MAS)  that  will  be  established  and  led  by  BAPPENAS.  BAPPENAS  is  also  the \nappointed  Government  body  to  monitor  support  coming  from  the  donor  community,  including \nsupport to BPK. \n \nConsistent  with  the  approach  taken  in  the  STAR  Sector  Development  Project,  BPK \n93. \nrecognizes that the work of the external audit is very dependent on systems established by the \nexecutive. The latter involve the funds flow and the internal controls put in place by the Ministry \nof  Finance.  In  addition,  a  risk-based  approach  to  auditing  that  recognizes  that  not  everything \ncan  be  audited  in  detail  is  very  dependent  on  the  effective  functioning  of  internal  audit.  For \nAceh, the critical internal audit institutions (BAWADAS) are those operating at the regional level \nof government\u2014the provincial and the district Bawasdas. BPK is keen to engage the Bawasdas \nin Aceh to help  ensure that the internal control systems are operating effectively in the districts. \nSome support is also envisaged as necessary for the central internal audit agencies in the line \nministries, the inspector generals. \n \n94. \nBPK  also  recognizes  that  the  donor  community  would  want  to  see  follow-up \ninvestigations  on  any  anticorruption  activities.  The  two  entities  that  play  a  key  role  are  the \nAttorney  General\u2019s  Office  and  KPK.  Unlike  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office,  KPK  is  a  relatively \nnew institution, and requires capacity building if it is to be able to carry out investigations on the \ncases referred by BPK. Its processes need to be strengthened and it needs to be provided with \nadditional  operating  budget  for  specific  Aceh  cases.  This  support  is  expected  to  allow  the \ncommunity  at  large  to  recognize  the  benefits  of  KPK  as  a  catalyst  for  change.  The  Aceh \nactivities of KPK will enable it to cement its role in the overall fiduciary framework of Indonesia. \n \n                                                 \n17   ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n59 \n\nNotwithstanding  the  fact  that  BPK\u2019s  mandate  is  limited  to  the  activities  of  Government \n95. \ninstitutions,  BPK  also  has  a  role  in  commenting  on  the  overall  strength  of  the  fiduciary \nframework covering government, NGO, and private institutions operating in Aceh. To that effect, \nBPK intends to liaise with auditors of the other institutions to identify the key fiduciary risks. At \nthe outset, Indonesian NGOs are receiving funds directly from many domestic and international \nsources.  However,  many  have  openly  stated  that  they  have  limited  financial  management \ncapacity  and  are  concerned  that  the  vast  amount  of  funds  being  channeled  directly  through \nthem  may  be  wasted.  They  have  requested  BAPPENAS  and  BPK  to  support  financial \nmanagement training. \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponents \n\nThe support will comprise six main subcomponents: (i) capacity building for BPK to carry \n96. \nout external auditing on the Aceh funds utilization; (ii) restoring the internal control and systems \nto channel funds in the Director General of Treasury in the Ministry of Finance; (iii) restoring the \ncapacity of local government internal audit structures (Bawasdas); (iv) providing support to the \nCommission for Eradication of Corruption in Indonesia; and (v) providing administrative support \nand general contingency.  \n \n97. \nThe total cost is estimated at $7.0 million equivalent, comprising $1.2 million of foreign \nexchange cost and $5.8 million equivalent of local currency (Table A2.12). The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table A2.13. \n \n\nTable A2.12: Cost Estimates for the Sound Fiduciary Framework Subcomponent  \n($ \u2019000) \n\n \nItem \nA.

Although the support to BPK and KPK will \ncover  activities  over  the  full  2  years,  support  for  the  development  of  appropriate  internal \ncontrols,  the  restoration  of  internal  audit  at  the  regional  government  level,  and  the  financial \nmanagement  training  of  the  NGOs  will  be  aimed  to  kick  start  the  overall  fiduciary  framework \nduring the next 8\u201312 months in Aceh. This will provide confidence to the donor community that \nappropriate structures are in place to allow BPK to carry out effective audits. After the first year \nthe  internal  control  systems  will  be  supported  by  a  combination  of  traditional  government \nstructures as well as more extensive reconstruction and rehabilitation projects being funded by \nthe  international  community.  Any  support  to  building  or  equipment  infrastructure  is  only  to \nensure that the immediate requirements for the kick-start process are met. Finally, the detailed \nimplementing  arrangements,  including  the  procurement  contracts  will  be  finalized  through \nspecialized  consultants  before  any  money  is  actually  disbursed.  If  this  results  in  any  savings, \nthese will either be returned to the funding source or reallocated once approval is given.  \n \n99. \nable to carry out the following: \n \n\nCapacity Building for BPK. In addition to its standard audit role, BPK is thought to be \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nConduct  an  ex  ante  assessment  of  the  internal  control  systems  and  the  funds \nflow  that  will  be  established  to  fast  track  the  rehabilitation  and  construction \nphase, and provide advice on to how to strengthen them. \nEstablish a new audit paradigm that would look at combining both financial and \noperational aspects of auditing, develop more streamlined and results-orientated \naudit approaches, and undertake smaller and more focused audits on a regular \nbasis  rather  that  one  audit  at  a  specific  point  in  time.  This  may  include  the \npossibility of having joint audits. \nTake a global perspective of the various types of support coming into the region, \nboth  public  and  private,  and  coordinating  with  the  auditors  of  the  private  and \nNGO  entities  so  that  a  more  comprehensive  picture  can  be  obtained  of  the \nactivities and its outcomes.19  \nCoordinating with audit institutes of the other tsunami-affected countries, as well \nas the donor countries to identify issues and concerns, as well as obtain lessons \nlearned from other previous disasters. \n\n100.  The proposed support to BPK focuses on (i) 4 months intensive audit for the crisis period \n(Feb\u2013May  2005)  and  (ii)  8  months  intensive  audit  for  the  rehabilitation  period  (June  2005\u2013 \nJanuary  2006).  The  audit  activities  will  be  closely  monitored  and  supervised  by  BPK \nmanagement who will be assisted by an international consultant. International experiences will \nbe  sought  by  holding  an  international  conference  involving  selected  supreme  audit  institutions \nand donors around the world. The audit activities will require supporting activities. BPK has no \noffices in Banda Aceh and so it will need to set up a temporary office in the province. The audit \nmay  require  follow-up  audit  involving  authorized/related  parties  such  as  the  Corruption \nCommission (KPK) through an investigative audit.  \n \n101.  A  critical  aspect  of  BPK\u2019s  role  of  in  auditing  the  tsunami  funds  is  the  need  to  establish \nconfidence in its auditing process and methodologies. BPK must ensure the donor community \nthat it will follow transparent and internationally accepted auditing procedures. BPK has agreed \nthat  it  will  look  to  establish  an  independent  advisory  body  comprising  individuals  from  key \nsupreme  audit  institutions,  who  will  provide  independent  advice  to  BPK.  In  addition,  BPK \n\n                                                 \n19   The  Government  has  already  appointed  Ernst  and  Young  to  be  the  auditors  for  the  Aceh  funds  that  are  being \nchanneled through the media-based collection agencies such as Metro TV. In addition, the United Nations is also \nlooking at a private audit firm to audit United Nations activities in the area. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n61 \n\nrecognizes  that  it  may  have  resource  constraints  and  where  necessary  will  engage  external \nauditors  to  carry  out  specific  audit  activities.  The  intention  is  that  the  advisory  body  and  the \nutilization  of  external  audit  staff  will  also  assist  capacity building in the long run. BPK will also \nassist the Government in collating data about the activities of the other organizations by liaising \nwith the other audit firms operating in Aceh. \n \n102.  Restoration  of  Internal  Control  and  Funds  Channeling  Systems  in  the  Director \nGeneral  of  Treasury  ($1.890  million).  This  would,  following  a  more  detailed  assessment  of \nneeds, look at; restoring the infrastructure of the central and local government treasury offices in \nBanda  Aceh;  providing  for  an  Aceh-North  Sumatra  focused  team  at  the  Director  General  of \nTreasury  offices  in  Jakarta;  restoring  information  technology  and  other  communication \nequipment; and supporting the Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Finance to establish the \nappropriate funds channeling, internal controls, and reporting systems for Aceh/North Sumatra \ndedicated funds..  \n \n103.  Restoring the Capacity of Local Government Internal Audit Structures (Bawasdas) \n($0.720 million). Working through the coordination of the Inspectorate General in the Ministry of \nHome Affairs, this would look at restoring the damaged local government internal audit agencies \n(Bawasda),  and  providing  the  appropriate  training  to  local  government  internal  auditors.  The \nSTAR  project  has  already  identified  the  need  to  support  Bawasda  at  the  provincial  level. \nHowever, given the scale of the damage it is proposed that the provincial and district Bawasdas \nin Aceh and North Sumatra be supported. \n \n104.  Providing Support to the Commission for Eradication of Corruption in Indonesia \nand  for  an  Aceh  Coordinator  ($0.450  million).  This support is a lump sum allocation to the \ncommission to undertake further investigation on any allegations of corruption arising out of the \naudits as well as from public sources. The commission will work closely with BPK as well as the \ninternal audit agencies in Government.  \n \n105.  Providing  Support  to  the  Working  Group  on  Governance  within  the   new \nReconstruction  and  Rehabilitation  Body  (R2MAS)  ($1.150  million).  BAPPENAS  has  been \nassigned  as  coordinator  for  R3MAS.  The  R3MAS  will  be  collapsed  into  a  new  Reconstruction \nand  Rehabilitation  Body\u2014R2MAS.  Within  R2MAS,  a  unit  will  coordinate  and  establish  the \noverall  financial  governance  systems  for  Aceh  funds.  This  support  to  the  working  group  in \nR2MAS  is  to  ensure  better  coordination  within  the  external  auditor  (BPK),  the  internal \nsupervision  institutions  (Bawasda,  BPKP,  Inspectorate  General),  other  private  auditors \ncompanies,  parliament,  NGOs,  and  the  general  public  in  monitoring  and  supervising  both  of \npublic and private aid funds on tsunami-affected areas in Indonesia. An important aspect is the \nspecific support that for NGO community on financial management. This is recognizes that the \nNGO  community  are  significant  components  in  the  disaster  situation  and  that  considerable \nfunds are being channeled to Aceh activities directly through them. The Government recognizes \nthat NGOs need more support while retaining their operational independence. \n \n106.  Funding  Administrative  Support  and  General  Contingency  ($0.470  million).  The \nlatter will be used to provide procurement and financial management specialists to monitor and \nreport on the Project; in addition, a small contingency will cover unforeseen requirements. \n \n\nc. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n107.  The  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra  assistance  is  designed  as  an  expansion  of  the  scope  of \nthe  STAR  project  and  will  be  known  as  the  STAR-Aceh  activity.  To  that  extent  the  same \nrespective STAR implementing agencies\u2013namely, BPK,  Inspectorate General of the Ministry of \nFinance,  and  Inspectorate  General  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  will  undertake  the \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nimplementation.  Support  to  KPK  will  be  channeled  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  An  Aceh \ncoordinator will be placed in the new R2MAS unit, which will be the Executing Agency for this \nactivity. The coordinator will be responsible for overall monitoring of the STAR-Aceh, as well as \nensure effective liaison with the STAR program loan activities.  \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n108.  The Project will fund 37 person-months of international experts and 213 person-months \nof  domestic  experts.  The  international  experts  will  ideally  comprise  ex  members  of  supreme \naudit institutions with at least 10 years of experience. They will builds BPK capacity to carry out \nexternal  auditing  on  Aceh  funds  utilization,  provide  BPK  with  an  advisory  body,  support  the \nexternal audit of the multidonor trust funds, and support R2MAS in identifying international best \npractices  for  the  management  of  disaster  funds.  The  domestic  consultants  have  a  range  of \nauditing and accounting expertise to support the following: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n2. \n\nDirectorate  General  of  Treasury  in  Ministry  of  Finance  in  designing  appropriate \ninternal control systems (90 person-months), \nInspectorate General in the Ministry of Finance on the internal audit systems (33 \nperson-staff months), \ndevelopment of appropriate funds flow systems (53 person-months), and \nR2MAS  to  devise  a  strategic  governance  framework,  and  provide  domestic \nexpertise on external-internal audit (36 person-months). \n\nEnhancing Governance in the Delivery of Project Assistance \n\n \n109.  This  component  is  to  facilitate  effective  implementation  of  disaster  management, \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  (DMRR)  support,  leading  to  the  economic  revival  of  the \naffected regions. Its immediate objective is to help achieve good governance in the  delivery of \nDMRR support to the affected regions. The component will have two subcomponents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nensuring sound fiduciary governance in the delivery of ETESP assistance, focusing \non  financial  management,  design  of  administrative  accountability  mechanisms, \nefficient procurement arrangements, and effective project implementation; and  \nparticipatory planning and monitoring and evaluation support, focusing on community \nparticipation,  land  tenure  assessment,  tracking  of  progress  with  regard  to  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), and monitoring and evaluation. \n\n \n110.  The component will involve the establishment of two teams to provide advisory support \nto  the  Government  and  ADB  in  all  general  project  administration  and  cross-cutting technical \nassessments  covered  in  the  Project  in  line  with  the  description  provided  in  para.  61  of  the \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President.  Most  activities  under  this  component  will  be \nanchored  at  the  extended  mission  to  Sumatra  (EMS),  and  support  the  implementation  of  its \nwork program in delivering ADB support.  \n \n111.  The total cost of this component is estimated at $3,500,000 equivalent, including foreign \nexchange  costs  of  $2,066,600  and  local  currency  costs  of  $1,433,400  equivalent.  ADB  will \nfinance the entire costs of this component in view of the emergency nature of the operation.  \n \n112.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  subcomponent  (i),  and  will  closely  liaise  with \nBAPPENAS  and  the  proposed  Implementation  Coordination  Board  for  Aceh-North  Sumatra \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction (BKP). BKP will be the Executing Agency for  subcomponent \n(ii).  About  78  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  about  252  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting will be required. Outline terms of reference and reporting arrangements for \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n63 \n\nthe consultants are set out in Supplementary Appendix D. The consultants will be recruited in \ntwo teams. The subcomponent (i) team may divide its time between BKP offices and EMS in the \naffected  regions,  and \nthe  consultants  under \nsubcomponent  (ii)  will  be  based  in  the  Province  of  Aceh.  EMS  shall  serve  as  a  hub  for  the \nteams. \n \n \n\nIndonesia  Resident  Mission,  while \n\nthe \n\nTable A2.14: Cost Estimates And Financing Plan of the Enhancing Governance \nSubcomponent \n($'000) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,056.0 \n  735.0 \n   60.0 \n   40.0 \n   20.0 \n\n2,622.0 \n2,055.0 \n  110.0 \n 70.0 \n  30.0 \n\n 1,566.0 \n1,320.0 \n     50.0 \n     30.0 \n     10.0 \n\nItem \n \nComponent 1: Fiduciary Governance \nRemuneration and Per Diem \nTravel \nOffice Facilities \nEquipment \nSupport for BAPPENAS/MOF for Central \nCoordinationa \nSurveys, Reports and Communications \nContingency \n \nComponent 2: Assessment, Monitoring and \nEvaluation \nRemuneration and Per Diem \nTravel \nEquipment \nSurveys, Reports and Communications \nContingency \n \n      Total \nBAPPENAS  =  Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional  (National  Development  Planning  Agency),  MOF  = \nMinistry of Finance. \na  \n\n   500.6 \n   396.0 \n     35.0 \n     10.0 \n     10.0 \n     49.6 \n \n2,066.6 \n\n  377.4 \n  245.0 \n     35.0 \n     10.0 \n     50.0 \n     37.4 \n \n1,433.4 \n\n  878.0 \n  641.0 \n    70.0 \n    20.0 \n    60.0 \n    87.0 \n \n3,500.0 \n\n      0.0 \n     10.0 \n   146.0 \n \n\n   60.0 \n   75.0 \n  222.0 \n \n\n   60.0 \n   65.0 \n   76.0 \n \n\nThis allocation will be used for central level coordination at BAPPENAS and MOF level.

An overall initial environmental examination (IEE) to assess the generic impacts of \neach project component shows that the ETESP will have a number of positive impacts on the \nenvironment.  These  include  rehabilitating  the  damaged  coastal  zones,  mangroves,  and  coral \nreefs; reviving agricultural production; and reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water \nsupply and sanitation facilities.  It  also  shows  that  none  of  the  envisaged  interventions,  at  this \nstage of project design, is known to be environmentally critical or projected to create significant \nadverse  or  negative  impacts  on  the  environment.  The  potential  negative  impacts  are  localized \nand short-term, and can be mitigated. Therefore, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is \nnot required. In addition, the spatial planning and environmental management component of the \nETESP will mainstream environmental considerations into the planning process. \n \nGiven the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, subproject-specific IEEs have not yet \n2. \nbeen  prepared,  but  will  be  developed  prior  to  implementation.  To  guide  the  environmental \nassessment  of  subprojects  and  facilitate  institutional  arrangements  and  compliance  with \nenvironmental  requirements  of  Indonesia  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  has  been  agreed  with  the \nGovernment (paras. 14-21). \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n3. \nThe ETESP has 11 main components: agriculture, fisheries, micro and small enterprise \nsupport, health, education, rural water supply and sanitation, housing, irrigation, spatial planning \nand  environmental  management,  roads  and  bridges,  and  power.  A  description  of  the \ncomponents is given in Appendix 2. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nPhysical and Ecological Resources. The tsunami generated a range of environmental \n4. \nproblems  with  harm  to  human  health  and  damage  to  the  environment.  It  caused  widespread \ndeposition  of  debris  including  municipal  waste  from  dump  sites,  household  waste,  and \nhazardous  substances,  and  it  triggered  coastal  zone  retreat  and  erosion,  coral  reef  damage, \nloss of marine and terrestrial habitats, soil salinization, destruction of vegetation and landscape, \nand  water  contamination.  The  environmental  damage  overall  is  estimated  at  $664.6  million,20 \ncomprising one fourth for direct destruction of environmental assets and the balance in losses in \nenvironmental services. \n \n5. \nEconomic  Development,  and  Social  and  Cultural  Resources.  Over  the  last  2 \ndecades, civilian and secessionist conflict in Aceh has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people. \nThe  central  Government  has  declared  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  as  national  disasters  and \ntaken  over  administration  of  the  province.  In  2003,  Aceh\u2019s  regional  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  was  Rp38.6  trillion  ($4.5  billion),  accounting  for  2.3%  of  national  GDP.  The  Central \nStatistical Agency has determined that 660 Acehnese villages, including urban villages, with a \npopulation  of  650,000  have  been  affected.  The  disaster  struck  individuals,  households, \ncommunities and social organizations, and economic chains. The incidence of poverty in Aceh \nwas lower than the national average until the introduction of martial law in 2001. However, the \n                                                 \n20  BAPPENAS (National Development Planning Agency) and International Donor Community. January 2005.

More information is given in the IEE report in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation  Measures \n\nReconstruction  works  on  most  infrastructure  facilities,  other  than  some  individual \n6. \nhousing, are expected to take place at original sites. Roads will follow the original right-of-way; \nchanges  in  alignment  or  widening  are  not  anticipated.  Short-term minor negative impacts may \nbe associated with civil works, such as dust and noise generation, soil erosion, and damage to \nland  and  surface  water  due  to  inappropriate  handling  of  excavated  materials  and  wastes.  In \nview of the high requirements for timber materials for reconstruction and their potential negative \nimpact on the forest resources in Aceh and North Sumatra, the ETESP will develop guidelines, \nbased upon the knowledge of key stakeholders and specialized organizations, for the purchase \nof timber to be used for construction projects. \n \n7. \nRapid  environmental  assessment  checklists  were  completed  for  the  various  project \ncomponents  from  10  to  14  March  2005.  They  provide  the  necessary  basic  information  for  this \npreliminary screening of potential impacts on the environment. The potential impacts have been \nbroken down to subcomponent level, as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding between \nthe Government and ADB on 10 March 2005. The possible environmental impacts that may be \nencountered  during  implementation  and  some  suggested  mitigating  measures21 are presented \nin the attached table. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\n \n8. \nA  multidisciplinary  environmental  assessment  team,  comprising  international  and \ndomestic consultants, experts, and government administration staff, will be set up in the project \nmanagement office (PMO). The team will carry out IEEs (or in the unlikely event the necessary \nEIAs, jointly with the environment specialist of the Southeast Asia Department), and inspect and \nensure  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  public  consultations,  mitigation  measures,  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  described  in  the  IEEs  for  all  subprojects  funded  under  the ETESP. \nThe  team  will  provide  overall  technical  advice  to  all  subprojects  on  a  day-to-day  basis  and \nproactively  carry  out  necessary  field  visits.  Moreover,  the  team  will  commission  environmental \nassessment  studies  to  individual  specialists  and  supervise  their  work.  The  team  will  work  in \nclose  consultation  with  staff  of  the  ETESP  component  on  spatial  planning  and  environmental \nmanagement,  the  environment  specialist  of  Southeast  Asia  Department  and  the  Environment \nand  Social  Safeguard  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  of  ADB \nheadquarters. \n \n9. \nThe  budget  required  for  these  tasks,  as  well  as  for  the  required  measures  for \nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring and site preparations for the individual subprojects, is \nestimated at  2.5%  of  the  total  project  cost,  or  $7.5  million  (called  the  environment  fund).  This \nPMO will manage this fund. Any surplus will be reallocated for other subproject activities. \n \n \n \n10.  Monitoring  activities  for  subprojects  will  be  determined  in  detail  in  the  individual \nsubproject  IEEs.  The  IEE  report  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  describes  the  rationale  for \nenvironmental monitoring of the ETESP activities in a list that requires continuous updating and \n                                                 \n21   Mitigation measures will be described in the subproject IEEs. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring \n\n2.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n70\n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nrevision, particularly  taking  account  of  recommended/agreed  measures  in  the  subproject  IIE \nreports. \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultations and Information Disclosure \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedure for  Subprojects \n\nDue to the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, a detailed public consultation has not \n11. \nyet  been  undertaken.  Meetings  during  ETESP  formulation  with  concerned  government \nagencies, bilateral donors, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and individuals from affected \ndistricts  confirmed  wide  interest  in  the  proposed  activities,  as  they  are  seen  as  essential  for \nreestablishing communities\u2019 livelihoods and supporting long-term sustainable development. \n \n12. \nAs all environmental documents are subject to public disclosure in accordance with the \nADB  Environment  Policy  (2002) and  Disaster  Emergency  and  Assistance  Policy  (2003); they \nwill be made available to the public, if requested. \n \nG. \n \n \n \n13. \nSubproject  IEEs  will  be  prepared  as  an  integral  part  of  subproject  design.  They  will \nprovide  information  on  baseline  environment  conditions  in  the  subproject  area,  and  key \nengineering  indicators  of  the  subproject  that  have  environmental  implications.  They  will  also \nidentify  specific  potential  adverse  impacts  related  to  location,  design,  construction,  and \noperation;  and  outline  specific  mitigation  measures,  including  financial  sources,  as  a \nprerequisite for subproject approval. A monitoring and enforcement program will be developed \nto ensure that none of the subprojects have major adverse environmental impacts. \n \n14.   Public consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part of \nenvironmental  assessment  for  each  scheme.  The  results  of  public  consultation  will  be \ndocumented and reflected in the IEE. \n \n\nRequirement for an Environmental Assessment Report  \n\n2. \n\nResponsibilities of Implementing Agencies and ADB \n\n \n15. \nof potential environmental problems/risks related to each subproject: \n\nThe  following  review  procedure  will  be  adopted  to  facilitate  identification  and  mitigation \n\nImplementing agencies (IAs) will have the following responsibilities: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nCarry out an IEE for each subproject22 and submit it to ADB as part of the \nsubproject proposal.  \n\nObtain  environmental  clearance  from  the  relevant  subproject  approving \nagency  and  ADB  for  environmental  compliance  before  awarding  any \ncontracts for that subproject.  \n\nif \n\nIrrespective  of \ninclude  basic \nthe  subproject  required  an \nenvironmental  safeguards  to  be  adopted  during  construction  in  the \ncontract  documents.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  IEE,  the  contract \ndocuments  will  include  clauses  for  the  implementation  of  environmental \nmitigation  measures  as  described  in  the  IEE  report  and  the  approving \nagency clearance. \n\nIEE, \n\n                                                 \n22   Except subprojects with solely capacity building and fiduciary/governance-related activities. \n\n \n(i) \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5               \n\n71\n\n \n\n         \n\nfully \n\n \nBe \nto  ADB  on \nfor  monitoring  and \nimplementation of the environmental mitigation measures described in the \nIEE report. \n\nresponsible \n\nreporting \n\n(ii) \n \n\nADB will have the following responsibilities: \n\nReview the IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects. \n\nDisclose the findings of the IEE and summary IEE in accordance with the \nrequirements under the ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Disaster and \nEmergency Assistance Policy (2004).  \n\nMonitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring  as \nnecessary. \n\n(d) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n16. \nThe IAs will ensure that ADB is given access to undertake environmental monitoring of \nsubprojects, if needed, and will submit quarterly progress review reports describing the progress \nof  environmental  monitoring  and  highlighting  any  other  environmental  issues  that  may  have \narisen  during  implementation,  and  measures  taken  to  address  such  issues.  The  IAs  will  also \nensure  that  all  environmental  assessment  documents,  including  the  environmental  monitoring \nreports, are maintained systematically as part of the subproject-specific record. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n \n17. \nProject siting is a major criterion for subproject selection. For instance, subprojects with \nsites proposed within the\u2014likely  to  be  declared\u2014coastal  buffer  zone  will  not  be  supported by \nthe  ETESP.  Subprojects  will  not  be  located  in  or  adjacent  to  environmentally  sensitive  areas \nsuch as (i) protected areas, (ii) buffer zones of protected areas, (iii) wetlands, (iv) mangroves, \n(v) estuaries, (vi) special areas for protecting biodiversity or with other significant ecological or \nother  values,  and  (vii)  pollution  hotspots.  The  ETESP  component  on  spatial  planning  and \nenvironmental  management  will,  inter  alia,  provide  support  in  the  process  of  identifying \nappropriate project sites during  the design stage so that environmental impacts that may arise \nfrom project siting can be avoided or minimized. \n \n18. \nIn  view  of  the  very  special  post-tsunami  situation,  any  subproject  preparation  should \ninclude site visits to assess whether a clean-up of debris/waste will be necessary or whether it \nhas already been completed in a satisfactory manner. If remedial actions are to be taken prior to \nconstruction  activities,  appropriate  clean-up/waste  disposal  activities  will  have  to  be  properly \ndefined and carried out. Costs for site visit and assessment and clean-up/disposal activities will \nhave to be borne by the subproject budget.  \n \nFor each subproject, an IEE will be prepared, with the exception of subprojects that can \n19. \nbe  identified  as  activities/nonphysical  interventions  to  build  up/reestablish  human  resource \ncapacities, fiduciary and governance framework, etc.  \n \nThe environmental assessment and review procedure will take into account any relevant \n20. \npost-tsunami  Government  regulations and procedures (e.g., guidelines for waste disposal and \nmanagement, reconstruction of housing). The IAs will ensure that all activities are carried out in \naccordance  with  both  existing  guidelines  and  any  new  guidelines  and  technical  standards,  as \nwell  as  with  ADB  environmental  assessment  requirements,  as  set  out  in  Environment  Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n72\n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nH. \n\nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n\n21. \nThe ETESP mostly focuses on reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, \nas  well  as  on  rebuilding  public  services  and  reestablishing  institutional  capacities  to  cope  with \nthe  impacts  of  the  disaster.  Only  minor  and  short-term  potentially  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated,  provided  that  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  is \nfollowed  and  be  fully  complied  with.  The  impacts  are  considered  to  be  controllable  through \nimplementation of appropriate mitigation measures and environmental monitoring, and through \nthe PMO\u2019s readiness to take corrective actions when deemed necessary and recommended by \nthe environmental assessment team. The adoption of good construction practices, incorporation \nof  mitigation  measures  during  design,  inclusion  of  suitable  clauses  in  construction  contract \ndocuments, and implementation of the agreed mitigation measures during construction will help \nprevent any environmental damage from happening. \n \n22. \nIn  summary,  the  IEE  for  the  ETESP  shows  that  no  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  are  expected  to  result  from  the  proposed  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  work. \nConsequently,  no  need  EIA  is  needed  at  this  stage.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  a  specific \nsubproject is rated as category A, a full subproject EIA for that particular subproject will have to \nbe undertaken. \n \n23. \nThe  PMO  will  comply  with  the  rule  to  regard  the  environmental  categorization  as  a \ncontinuous  process  that  may  change  the  environmental  assessment  requirements  within  the \nsubproject  cycle.  Previously  unknown  but  then  available  information  must,  at  all  times  and  all \ncircumstances, be taken into consideration for the continuous task of environmental assessment \nof the ETESP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5               \n\n73\n\n \n\n         \n\n \nTable A5:  Components, Their Potential Environmental Impacts, and Proposed Mitigation \nMeasures \n\n \n\nComponent \n\nSubcomponent \n\nPotential Impacts \n\nAgriculture \n\nNone anticipated. \n\nCommunity \nempowerment \nRehabilitation \nand \nrestoration of \nfarming and \nsupport services \n\nCommunity \nempowerment \nand resource \nmanagement \nRestoration of \ncapture  fisheries, \naquaculture, and \nsmall-scale \nfishing \npost-harvest \nfacilities \nSupport services \n\nLeasing facility \nfor small farms \nand micro-\nenterprises \nRehabilitation of \nprimary health \ncare facilities \nRehabilitation/ \nreconstruction of \nfirst referral \ndistrict hospitals \n \n\nPotential issue of subproject \nsiting.

The ETESP will assist rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of Aceh through a multisector approach covering housing, education, health, water and \nsanitation, agriculture, natural resources and coastal management, road and power infrastructure, and \ncapacity building. Each sector includes various components subdivided in subprojects. Components with \nground  impacts  include  natural  resources  and  coastal  management,  or  components  requiring \nrehabilitation, reconstruction, or new construction of water and sanitation facilities; housing; health centers; \nschool  buildings;  government  offices;  irrigation  schemes;  power  distribution  networks;  and  roads  and \nbridges.  Only  subprojects  aiming  at  new  construction  are  expected  to  involve  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR). Rehabilitation or reconstruction subprojects will be implemented at their previous sites \nand in general are not expected to involve LAR. \n \n2. \nTo understand LAR magnitude and potential implementation difficulties, considering the level of \ndisruption  and  destruction  caused  by  the  disaster  is  important.  Some  of  the  subprojects  areas  have \nregistered  no  disruption  and  some  have  been  partially  disrupted  and  damaged,  but  continue  to  host \nfunctional communities. The scope of subprojects in these areas will be more developmental. However, \nsome  areas  have  been  completely  damaged  physically  and  disrupted  socially.  In  the  latter,  active \ncommunities, a functioning government, and a reliable spatial plan will have to be established to allow \nsubproject implementation.  \n \n3. \nAs LAR planning and compensation will be much more difficult in areas that have been completely \ndestroyed, project activities have been divided in two phases. Phase 1, to begin after approval of the grant \nand  its  effectiveness  and  continue  until  ETESP  completion  in  mid-2008,  includes  (i)  rehabilitation  or \nreconstruction activities, (ii) construction activities in areas with no or partial disruption, and (iii) preparatory \nwork  for  phase  2,  involving  assessment,  governance,  spatial  planning,  and  community  empowerment \ntasks. Phase 2 will begin by October 2005, after the preparatory work under phase 1 has been concluded, \nand  continue  until  ETESP  completion.  Phase  2  will  target  construction  activities  in  areas  where  total \ndestruction and disruption have occurred. This strategy will allow work on subprojects without LAR or with \nthe simplest LAR cases early in project implementation, thus leaving adequate time to carry out more \ncomplicated LAR tasks later, after the completion of the necessary due diligence studies. \n \nB. \n \nThe National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) has prepared a  land acquisition and \n4. \nresettlement  policy  framework  and  implementation  guideline  (LARPFPG)  for  the  ETESP,  as  the \nGovernment has yet to finalize the establishment of the proposed Implementation Coordination Board for \nAceh-North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Rec onstruction (BKP), which is envisaged to be the  Executing \nAgency  for  the  ETESP.  The  LARPFPG  will  be  approved  by  the  Aceh  provincial  government  and \nimplementing  agencies.  Given  the  ETESP\u2019s  emergency  assistance  nature,  the LARPFPG establishes \nsimplified and fast-tracked LAR implementation mechanisms consistent with ADB policies on disaster and \nemergency assistance and involuntary resettlement. 23 \n \n \n                                                 \n23  \n\nThe  Policy  on  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  (OM/D7)  states  that  ADB  emergency  initiatives  remain \nsubject  to  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  though  its  implementation  may  be  simplified  and  fast-tracked. \nSpecifically, OM/D7 states that when emergency projects involve LAR and require urgent processing, Board approval \ncan be obtained based on the preparation of a resettlement framework but not, as normally required, of impact surveys \nand resettlement plans, which may be postponed until after Board approval.  \n\nResettlement Policy Framework \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6               \n\n77\n\n \n\n         \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nModified LAR Processing and implementation Procedures \n\n \n5. \nGiven the ETESP emergency assistance nature, LAR processing will be simplified for document \npreparation, approval, and disclosure. Table A6.1 summarizes the simplified LAR approach and compares \nit with the standard approach. \n \n\nTable A6.1: Simplified Land Acquisition and Resettlement Approach for the Project \n\n \nSimplified Approach \n\nDocumentation \n\n(i) \nInitial Poverty and Social Assessment (IPSA).  To be prepared for each \nsubproject, the IPSA provides basic information on (a) subproject activity and site \ndisruption  level;  (b)  whether  the  subproject  will  entail  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR) and therefore requires the preparation of a land acquisition and \nresettlement action plan (LARAP); and if yes, the expected magnitude of LAR; (c) \nwhether  the  subproject  will  entail  community-driven  modalities  and  therefore \nrequires the preparation of a community action plan (CAP). \n  \n(ii)  Readiness Report. The report will justify phase 2 subproject implementation \non technical, economic, and social grounds. The social justification will include the \npreparation of a spatial plan and a social assessment addressing (a) land tenure at \nthe  subproject  site,  (b)  formal/informal  groups  that  could  help  with  LAR \npreparation/implementation, \n(c)  capacity-building  needs,  and  (d)  available \nmechanisms  accepted  by  local  communities  to  carry  out  impact  surveys,  land \nredistribution, and compensation. \n \n(iii)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan. Using a simplified format, \nthe LARAP will summarize (a) LAR impacts and the number of people affected, (b) \npolicy framework and entitlements; (c) consultation activities with those affected; (d) \ngrievance  redress  participation;  (e)  LAR  organization  and  community-agreed \narrangements  for  compensation,  relocation,  land  redistribution,  and  income \nrestoration;  (f)  institutional  framework;  (g)  resettlement  budget  and  financing;  (h) \nimplementation schedule; and (i) monitoring and evaluation procedures. \n \n(iv)  Community Action plan. LAR for community-driven development subprojects \nwill  be  planned  and  implemented  through  a  CAP  documenting  (a)  impacts and \ncosts, (b) participatory planning tasks carried out, (c) project design features agreed \nwith the those affected, (d) community-accepted strategies including land donation \nand redistribution strategies, (e) costs, and (f) the community endorsement of CAP. \nProcessing \n\n(i)  ETESP grant approval will be conditional on ADB and the Executing Agency \napproving the LARPFPG. \n \n \n(ii)  Preparation  of  phase  1  subprojects  will  be  conditional  on  Aceh  province\u2019s \napproval of the LARPFPG. Initiation of phase 2 activities will be conditional on the \npreparation of subprojects\u2019 IPSAs and readiness reports . \n \n(iii)  If  the IPSA indicates that a subproject requires LAR, contract awards will be \nconditional on the preparation of LARAPs or CAPs as needed and on their approval \nby local governments, implementing agencies, and ADB. \n \n(iv)  In  principle,  for  subprojects  under  phase  1  and  2  that  involve  LAR  and \nLARAP/CAP,  implementation  will  be  a  condition  for  mobilizing  civil  works \ncontractors.  However,  for  subprojects  in  phase  1,  actual  compensation  may  be \npostponed  after  civil  works  begin  if  this  (a)  does  not  cause  livelihood  losses to \npeople affected, (b) is agreed to by those affected, and (c) the compensation rates \nhave been officially communicated to them.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\nComparison with Standard Approach \n\nto \n\ninclude  site \n\n(i)  Slightly  modified \ndisruption level \n \n \n \n \n\nthe \n(ii)  Same.

For subprojects affecting up to 200 \npeople,  ADB  approval  will  be  given  by  ADB\u2019s  extended  mission  to  Sumatra  in \nconsultation with the Southeast Asia Regional Department of ADB headquarters; for \nsubprojects affecting more than 200 persons, ADB approval will be given by the \nthe  Regional  and  Sustainable \nSoutheast  Asia  Regional  Department  and \nDevelopment Department at ADB headquarters.  \n \n(ii)  LARAPs/CAPs  in  Bahasa  will  be  disclosed  to  those  affected.  However,  only \nLARAPs  and  CAPs  for  subprojects  affecting  more  than  200  persons  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website. \n \n\nC. \n\nETESP Compensation Eligibility and Entitlements  \n\n(i) The standard approach requires that all \nLARAPs and CAPs are approved by ADB \nheadquarters. \n \n \n \n \n \n(ii) The standard approach requires that all \nLARAPs are disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n\n6. \nLAR  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  relevant  Indonesian  laws  and  ADB  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and disaster and emergency assistance. Though Indonesian law (Presidential \nDecree  No.  55/1993)  and  the  ADB  policies  are  generally  consistent,  they  differ  slightly  on  land \ncompensation and entitlements of informal settlers. The LARPFPG reconciles these differences by setting \ngeneral principles, compensation eligibility, entitlements, and land donation provisions that are in line with \nADB policies.  \n \nPolicy Principles. The LARPFPG outlines the following policy principles: (i) negative impacts will \n7. \nbe minimized as much as possible; (ii) resettlement and compensation will be carried out to improve or at \nleast  restore  the  pre-project  living  standards  of  people  affected;  (iii)  those  affected  will  be  thoroughly \ninformed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement plan design; (iv) land rights of women, \nwidows, orphans, and elders without family will be safeguarded; (v) LAR will be executed with thorough \nattention to titling issues; and (vi) as much compensation and resettlement subsidies as possible will be \nprovided in full prior to ground leveling and demolition.  \n \nEligibility Provisions. All affected persons  are entitled to compensation or at least rehabilitation \n8. \nunder the ETESP including (i) people losing Hak Milik (title), Guna Usaha (usufruct), Ulayat (traditional) or \nWaqf (religious) rights; (ii) informal settlers; (iii) tenants and laborers; (iv) owners of buildings, crops, or \ntrees  attached  to  the  land;  and  (v)  people  losing  business  income.  Eligibility  for  compensation will be \nlimited by a cut-off date to be set for each subproject on the day corresponding to the beginning of the \nimpact assessment. Affected people who settle in the affected areas after the cut-off date will not be \neligible for compensation. \n \n9. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEntitlements.

For participatory development subprojects where LAR is directly linked to direct \nbenefits  for  people  affected,  BKP  may  seek  land  procurement  through  voluntary  donations  or  land \nredistribution as long as the following conditions are observed: (i) those affected donate their land based \non  an  informed  consent,  i.e.,  prior  to  their  decision  they  have  been  informed  of  their  compensation \nentitlement at market rates and actually offered the relative compensation amounts; and (ii) the donation \n\n \n\nTenant/ \nleaseholder \n\nTitleholder \n\nOwners including \ninformal settlers \n\nRenters \n\naffected, \nincluding \ninformal settlers \nAll people \naffected \nincluding \ninformal settlers \nAll people \naffected \nincluding \ninformal settlers \nAll people \naffected  by \nrelocation \n\n\f \n\n80\n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\ndoes  not  affect  the  donor\u2019s  livelihood;  (iii)  the  voluntary  aspect  of  the  donation  is  documented  by  a \ndocument signed by the donor and verified by civil society organizations that he/she is aware of the above \nconditions. \n\nD. \n\nLAR Organization and Responsibilities \n\nGovernment.  The  Aceh  governor  will  establish  a  provincial  land  acquisition  committee  for \n11. \noverall supervision of LAR policy and funding. The committee will closely coordinate with all other \nagencies involved in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and North Sumatra, and will include \nan  officer  in  charge  of  issues  related  to  ADB  activities.  Each  district  will  establish  a  resettlement \ncommittee to be responsible for policy, valuation, and compensation issues.  \n  \n12. \nField Activities.  For day-to-day management of LAR activities in the field, a land acquisition and \nresettlement unit (LARU) will be established in each district. The LARU will report to the district head, who \nwill be responsible for distributing and controlling LAR funds. The LARU will be managed by an executive \nofficer contracted from the public or private sector who has experience in participatory planning and LAR \nissues.  The  LARU  will  consist  of  a  team  of  variable  dimensions  to  meet  needs  in  the  areas  of  land \nplanning  and  impacts,  participatory  planning  facilitation,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  long-term \nrehabilitation planning. Village governments will support LARU activities as required. \n \n13. \nCivil Society. Civil society organizations or informal institutions will assist the local governments in \nLARAP and CAP preparation and implementation tasks. Besides representing those affected, they may \nalso participate in the administration of LAR or community planning tasks under government supervision \nwhen feasible and needed.  \n \n14. \nADB. In view of the magnitude of the Aceh and North Sumatra rehabilitation and reconstruction \ntasks, ADB will open a regional office in Medan (North Sumatra) and a field facility in Banda Aceh. The \noffices will be staffed with at least one consultant with extensive experience in land administration and \nLAR,  and  one  consultant  with  extensive  experience  in  community  planning.  These  consultants  will \nfacilitate LAR and participatory planning by liaising with local governments, supervising the work of ETESP \nconsultants, and engaging in project administration tasks related to LARAP and CAP implementation. The \nconsultants  will  also  review  the  documents  prepared  by  ETESP  consultants,  ensure  that  these  are \nconsistent with ADB policies, and contribute as needed to the LARAP and CAP approval process. Finally, \nthe consultants will be tasked with capacity building, training, and monitoring activities. They will ensure \nthat the PLAC, resettlement committees, and LARUs understand the requirements of the LARPFPG, and \nwill  organize  capacity-building  workshops  for  LARU  field  teams.  For  monitoring,  the  consultants  will \ncontribute  as  needed  to  the  selection  of  external  monitoring  agencies,  review  internal  and  external \nmonitoring reports, and suggest solutions to eventual LAR or CAP implementation problems. ADB will \nensure that capacity in the area of gender and development is sufficient, either among the consultants or \nwith nongovernment organizations (NGOs) assisting in the rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. \n \nE. \n \n15. \nVulnerable Groups\u2019 Issues. Households headed by women, widows, disabled persons, orphans, \nor elders without family will receive special assistance for house relocation/reconstruction and will be given \nparticular attention. During LARAP or CAP implementation, their land rights will be carefully safeguarded. \nSpecific livelihood improvement strategies for their benefit are currently under study for the post-ETESP \nperiod. These strategies, which may include employment in project activities, training, and microfinance \nloans, will be outlined in the LARAPs.  \n\nLARAP and CAP Implementation Tasks \n\n16. \nConsultation and Participation. Based on a community-driven design, project preparation will \nbring both beneficiary communities and people affected into a continuous participatory process concerning \nLAR and community planning decisions. The LARAPs and CAPs will document this process by listing and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 6               \n\n81\n\n \n\n         \n\n \n\n \n\nCapacity Building. As the PLAC, resettlement committees, LARUs, and NGOs may have little \n\nsummarizing all meetings, recording the number of meeting participants, and providing a signed proof of \naffected people\u2019s agreement to the decisions made. \n \n17. \nexperience with ADB\u2019s resettlement policy, capacity building and training will be provided.  \n \n18. \nComplaints  and  Grievances.  Basic  mechanisms  and  an  appeals  system  have  been  agreed \nupon  with  the  Government.  Grievances  will  be  lodged  with  the  LARU.  If  the  issue  is  not  solved,  the \naffected person can appeal to the LAC. If individuals remain unsatisfied, they will have right to submit the \nappeal to the provincial governor. Finally if the complaint cannot be solved at the provincial level, the \nindividual may seek satisfaction through the appropriate court of law. \n \n19.  Monitoring.  LAR  and  the  CAPs  will  be  subjected  to  both  internal  and  external  monitoring. \nInternal monitoring will be conducted by the LARUs and reported to ADB through quarterly project \nimplementation reports. External monitoring will be assigned to an external monitoring agency hired \nby  BKP  and  approved  by  ADB.  The  agency  will  be  chosen  among  NGOs,  academic  Institutions, \nand consulting firms. Depending on BKP\u2019s preference, one agency may cover the entire ETESP or \nseveral  monitoring  agencies  may  monitor  subprojects  in  different  districts.  ADB  will  prepare  the \nterms of reference once project implementation has begun. External monitoring will be carried out \nsemi-annually, and its results reported to the LARUs and ADB.  The external monitoring agency will \nalso be given evaluation tasks. After the conclusion of LAR for a subproject, the agency will prepare \nan evaluation report.

Census  data  and \nliterature indicate the groups living in the disaster-affected areas are the ethnic Acehnese, the \nLokon, Defayan and Sigulai on Simeulue, and the Nias Islands. Other groups from outside the \nregion  live  in  the  affected  areas,  including  ethnic  Javanese  and  ethnic  groups  indigenous  to \nNorth  Sumatra  province  who  migrated  into  Aceh.  The  following  table  shows the distribution of \nethnic  groups  prior  to  the  disaster.  During  project  preparation,  the  ethnic  composition  of  the \naffected  areas  was  reviewed  by  an  anthropologist,  who  determined  that  based  on  the \ninformation available, these groups, while ethnic minorities, were sufficiently mainstreamed into \nnorthern  Sumatran  social  and  political  economies.  However,  further  investigation  is  needed  to \nverify  whether  these  groups  or  any  others  in  the  affected  areas  significantly  differ  in  terms  of \nculture,  society,  and  political  organization  from  the  mainstream.  The  implications  of  any  such \ndifferences will be carefully factored into project activities to ensure compliance with the  Policy \non Indigenous Peoples of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n\nTable A7:  Dominant Ethnic Groups in the Disaster-Affected Villages in  \nAceh Province Prior to December 2004 \n\n \n\n  \nEthnic Group \nAbal \nAbung Bunga Mayang \nAceh \nBanten \nDairi \nGayo Luwes \nGayo Serbe Jadi \nJawa \nKencing \nSimeulu \nSunda \nNo Answer \nSource: Badan Pusat Statistic, Aceh Province for village impact and Podes Survey \n2003 for predominant ethnic group by village.

Specific  subproject  issues  will  be  dealt  with  through  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  or  indigenous  peoples  specific  action  (IPA),  based  on \nintensive  participatory  planning.  Depending  on  the  gravity  of  the  impact  and  the  degree  of \nindigenous  people\u2019s  vulnerability,  an  IPDP  will  be  prepared  as  a  stand-alone  document  or  as \npart  of  the  subproject  development.  Where  required,  the  IPA  will  be  prepared  as  part  of  the \nsubproject development.  \n \nThe  IPPF  provides  a  general  introduction  to  indigenous  people\u2019s  issues  related  to  the \n 3. \nETESP,  outlines  the  criteria  established  by  ADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples\u2019  policy,  identifies \nindigenous people, and provides an overview of indigenous communities likely to be affected by \nthe ETESP. The IPPF also sets the policy and procedural framework relevant for the ETESP as \na whole; outlines the content  of a model IPDP/IPA; and describes the strategy to be followed in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7               \n\n83\n\n \n\n         \n\n \ndefining  the  different  types  of  initiatives  fitting  the  degree  of  impact  intensity  and  relative \nvulnerability of affected communities. \n \n4. \nAs  for  the  identification  criteria,  the  IPPF  establishes that indigenous people are those \nwho in various degrees descend from groups present in specific areas before the establishment \nof modern states and relative borders, and maintain distinct self- or non-self-ascribed identities. \nThe following additional identification criteria will be used to establish the degree of vulnerability \nof  affected  indigenous  people  and  the  type  of  action  to  be  developed  for  an  IPDP:  (i)  use  of \ndistinct  languages,  (ii)  active  maintenance  of  sociocultural  systems  and  institutions that differ \nfrom the sociocultural system and institutional/political tradition of dominant societies, (iii) pursuit \nof  livelihood  in  the  margins  of  the  market  system,  and  (iv)  maintenance  of  unique  ties  and \nattachments to natural resources and ancestral territories.  \n \nThe IPPF establishes that IPDP and IPA interventions for affected indigenous people will \n5. \nhave to (i) reflect local culture, beliefs, needs, and preferred options of affected communities; (ii) \nreflect the outcome of participatory planning methodologies; (iii) consider traditional procedures \nand  functions  of  local  institutions;  (iv)  fit  local  production  systems;  (v)  promote  self-reliance \namong  the  affected  communities;  and  (vii)  ensure  that  adequate  lead  time  and  arrangements \nare provided for implementation of such interventions. \n \nThe IPPF establishes that the IPDPs and IPA will be prepared by specialists familiar with \n6. \nindigenous  people  issues,  who  have  anthropological  and  sociological  expertise.  An  Adat \n(traditional law) expert is being engaged to support ETESP implementation. The IPDPs and IPA \nwill include the following:  \n \n\nan  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessment  describing  (a)  the  affected \ncommunity,  identifying  the  group  of  indigenous  people;  (b)  type  and  magnitude  of \ndirect and indirect impacts; (c) number of households and people affected; (d) social \norganization;  (e)  livelihood  and  land  tenure  patterns;  (f)  history  of  relations  with \noutsiders  (including  eventual  transmigrasi  [migrating]  communities);  (g)  degree  of \nadaptation  to  mainstream  society  and  culture;  and  (h)  local  political  forms  and \ndegree of participation in formal state administration mechanisms;  \n\nan  assessment  of  (a)  the  degree  of  vulnerability  of  the  affected  indigenous \ncommunities and of the type of actions needed based on the type of physical impacts \nof  a  subproject;  (b)  implementation  capacity  of  the  affected  communities,  local \ngovernment, and subproject teams; and, if necessary, (c) a capacity-building plan to \nreinforce IPDP/IPA implementation;  \n\ndocumentation  of \nthe  affected \ncommunities,  local  governments,  subproject  teams,  and  the  line  agency  of  the \nsubproject; and  \n\nthe  participatory  planning  exercise \n\ninvolving \n\na separate community development action plan will be required for IPDPs that (a) is \nformally  endorsed  by  the  affected  communities;  (b)  reflects  the  results  of  the \nindigenous  peoples  identification  assessment  and  participatory  planning  activities; \nand  (c)  provides  details  on  needed  IPDP,  organization  framework,  monitoring \nscheme, implementation schedule, and budget.

The IPA will be prepared to (i) \nintegrate  indigenous  people  (who  might  be  excluded  from  the  subproject)  into  the \nbeneficiary  group  and  (ii)  incorporate  indigenous  people's  specific  needs  (that  may \nnot be addressed by the subproject) into the subproject plan. \n\n(i) \n\n  \n(ii) \n\n  \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  IPDP  will  include,  with  the  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessment, \ndirections  to  compensate  affected  persons  as  needed  if  (a)  negative  impacts  affect \nindigenous  people  groups  maintaining  a  degree  of  sociocultural  and  institutional \ndistinction from mainstream society; and (b) impacts carry a sociocultural dimension \nbut do not have broad community effects (e.g., the houses to be reconstructed are of \na  specific  traditional  type,  or  compensation  needs  to  follow  specific  traditional \nprocedures).  If  the  issue  is  related  to  land  tenure  the  IPDP  will  be  included  as  a \nchapter in the land acquisition and resettlement action plan. \n\n \n8. \nThe  Adat  specialist  will  carry  out  the  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessments  in \nconjunctions with the implementing agencies for the subprojects and identify the need for IDPFs \nand IPA. These will be prepared with the support of the Adat specialist and submitted to ADB for \napproval  together  with  the  subproject  proposal  for  ETESP  financing.

Areas affected by a disaster cannot heal \nthemselves without comprehensive support to restore access to basic services and enable affected people to regain a \nnormal  life.  The  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Emergency  Assistance  Project  (ETESP)  covers  the  sectors  essential  to \nstemming  poverty  and  restoring  growth,  and  establishes  a  precedent  for  a  sound  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nresponse for other disaster-affected areas in the future.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nThe tsunami and earthquake resulted in death, injury, loss of assets, and displacement of individuals and communities in \nnorthern  Sumatra.  An  estimated  200,000  persons  are  dead  or  missing,  and  400,000  internally  displaced.  The  primary \nimpact of the disaster was in Aceh province. The disaster followed nearly 30 years of conflict in Aceh with martial law \nimposed  from  2001  to  2003.  During  this  long  period,  activities  by  both  parties  resulted  in  kidnappings,  torture,  and \nkillings, as well as violence, particularly against women. While Aceh had been one of the better-off provinces, it became \nthe third poorest province out of 30 after 2001. The reconstruction and rehabilitation thus comes against a backdrop of \nconflict-traumatized  communities  and  conflict-disrupted  economy.  The  impact  of  the  disaster  extends  beyond  the \naffected 700 villages in Aceh and North Sumatra. The disaster hit a provincial capital and several significant secondary \ntowns,  destroying  business  chains  and  market  access  for  goods produced by the poor. Access to basic services was \nalso disrupted by damage to buildings, equipment, vehicles, and roads, and by deaths and injuries of skilled people. \nTeachers and nurses suffered heavily in the disaster as they were the first to respond to the emergency. Destruction of \nhouses and buildings stripped individuals and communities of shelter and places to undertake business and participate \nin  public  and  social  life.  The  remaining  infrastructure  is  being  strained  as  are  receiving  families  and communities \nproviding  temporary  support  to  those  displaced.  Strains  on  receiving  communities  combined  with  unclear  and  varying \nexternal  support  may  lead  to  conflicts  between  those  indirectly  and  directly  affected.  Following  the  immediate  relief \nefforts,  a  comprehensive  plan  must  to  be  implemented  to  restore  access  to  economic  and  social  life.  The  ETESP  is \nessential to restore the region on a path toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n\nTargeting classification: General  \n \n\nIntervention \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n   No \n\n   No  \n\nX  Yes \n\nX  Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe participation process has started at the central planning level. A master plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nAceh and North Sumatra reconstruction is being developed by the Government in consultation with civil society. At the \nETESP  level,  the  needs  have  been  identified  through  a  joint  donor-government  damage  assessment  process.  The \ndetailed planning, implementation, and monitoring for community infrastructure will be undertaken with consultation and \nparticipation of the target communities.  \n \nFor some sectors, such as shelter, the community will be defined by geographic and administrative boundaries, i.e., the \nvillage.  For  other  sectors,  the  community  will  be  defined  on  the  basis  of  social  structures  such  as  water  user \nassociations,  farmer  groups,  and  fisher  organizations.  The  relevant  community  will  be  involved  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the subproject. Efforts will be made to work with and strengthen existing local community institutions. \n \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n           The principal concern is for women to have equitable access to social life and livelihood restoration. Women have \nparticular vulnerabilities and responsibilities due to their reproductive, child rearing, and family-nurturing role. Women are \nalso  subject  to  violence  in  situations  where  social  order  has  been  disrupted,  such  as  during  a  period  of  conflict  and \ndisaster.  The  30-year  conflict  in  Aceh  has  resulted  in  a  high  rate  of  households  headed  by  women  and  internal \ndisplacement. As a result, many women are required by necessity to take all responsibility for supporting the household. \nThe disaster has resulted in an increase in the proportion of fragmented families, and more women will find themselves \nalone  or  the  sole  support  for  their  families.  Reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  support  must  address  women\u2019s  special \nneeds and those related to the household, i.e., reproductive health, shelter, and water supply and sanitation. It must also \naddress their need for livelihood restoration. \n \n\nNormative  values  in  common  currency,  particularly  among  the  Acehnese,  would  suggest  that  women  are \nconfined  to  a  limited  economic  sphere.  The  adoption  of  Sharia  law  in  2003  in  Aceh  province  reinforces  these \nperceptions.  In  practical  terms,  women  in  the  disaster-affected  area  are  important  but  invisible  actors  in  the  local \neconomy.  Without  a  gender  screen,  key  opportunities  to  restore  women  to  social  and  economic  life  are  likely  to  be \npassed  over.  Project  interventions  should  aim  at  (i)  ensuring  that  women\u2019s  roles  in  the  local  economy  and  business \nchain are clearly identified so that opportunities for support and restoration are not overlooked, and (ii) promoting access \nfor restoration of women\u2019s assets and economic activities. \n \n \nRehabilitation programs aim to restore affected persons to a higher level of well-being than before the disaster. \nProject implementation must respect local norms while promoting women to have a larger role in social and economic \nlife.  Some  local  cultural  traditions  provide  access  and  social  protection.  For  example,  women  may  have  special  forest \nareas for collecting firewood or gathering medicinal plants, and the house is traditionally a female asset. Local customs \nthat protect women should be understood and reinforced.  \n \n \nThe  ETESP  components  are  still  in  a  relatively  general  form.  Hence  the  gender  action  plan,  at  this  stage  of \ndevelopment, is in the form of recommendations rather than specific actions and targets. Specific gender action plans \nwill  be  developed  for  the  subproject  components  as  they  are  finalized.  They  will  aim  to  (i)  protect  women\u2019s  rights  to \nassets and opportunities, (ii) balance pressures to promote normative values constraining women that are against their \npractical needs and aspirations, and (iii) provide specific support to develop business and entrepreneurial skills to female \nhouseholds.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\nX    Yes \n\n  No \n\nE.
