The project will  provide strategic and comprehensive support for the Ziyang Municipal \nGovernment  (ZMG)  to  (i)  improve  the  urban  environment  and  livability  of  Ziyang  Municipality \n(Ziyang), and (ii) shift to high-quality economic growth on a more inclusive green development \npath.1 The project is envisaged to play a demonstrative role for medium-sized cities with similar \nconditions in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB).2 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe YREB is one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC.3 Its nine provinces \n2. \nand two specially administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the population, 40% \nof freshwater resources, and about 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While the YREB has \nbenefited from extensive development since the late 1980s, particularly in the eastern delta area, \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin lags behind that of \nthe  coastal  areas  and  is  below  its  potential.  These  parts  of  the  YREB  still  face  significant \ndevelopment challenges as a result of (i) increasing pollution and pressure on natural resources; \n(ii)  slow  transformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification;  (iii)  limited \nintegration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional coordination \nfor strategic planning. The YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic achievement and \nenvironmental quality. \n\n3. \nTo  manage  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \ndevelopment  plan  2016\u20132030,  which  stipulates  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and \npromotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB\u2019s future growth.4 Inclusive \ngreen  development  aims  to  shift  from  a  traditional,  subsector  approach  to  a  crosscutting, \nintegrated approach leading to a sustainable development model; solve the challenges of rapid \nurbanization;  and  serve  as  a  guide  to  socioeconomic  development.  In  this  context,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  government  have  agreed  to  adopt  a  framework  approach, \nproviding  about  $2.0 billion  of funding  in  the  YREB  during  2018\u20132020 to  strategically  program \nADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB. In doing so, priority is given to the \nfollowing  four  areas:  (i)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and  management  of \nwater  resources;  (ii)  inclusive  green  industrial transformation; (iii)  construction of  an  integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. The project \n                                                \n1  Inclusive green development is defined as an integrated approach encompassing sustainable, resilient, accessible, \nand affordable solutions to the challenges faced by the urban poor and vulnerable groups by enhancing their access \nto  urban  services  and  infrastructure  through  targeted  investments.  This  integrated  approach  encourages  an \ninstitutional  delivery  mechanism  that  brings  together  all  institutions  and  stakeholders\u2014government,  the  private \nsector,  and  civil  society\u2014that  have  the  capacity  to  deliver  systems  for  inclusive  urban  service  delivery.

Beijing. \n \n\n\fwill be the first in the PRC to showcase such economic development and diversification for cities \nand municipalities in the upper and middle reaches of the YREB, tackling the dual challenges of \nurbanization  and  environmental  degradation.  The  project\u2019s  emphasis  on  balanced  regional \nurbanization  and  inclusive  green  growth  ensures  that  development  considers  the  needs  of  all \npopulation  groups,  with  a  particular  focus  on  providing  affordable,  sustainable,  resilient,  and \naccessible services to women, and poor and marginalized people.5 \n\n4. \nThe Yangtze River is coming under increasing pressure from rapid economic growth and \nurbanization.  In  2015,  the  discharge  of  treated  wastewater  into  the  Yangtze  River  totaled  an \nestimated  34.7  billion  tons,  of  which  43.61%  was  domestic  wastewater  and  56.39%  industrial \nwastewater.6 Since  1978,  numerous  industries  have  been  developed  along  the  Yangtze  River \nand its tributaries, taking advantage of the waterway as an easy access to water resources and \nlow-cost  transportation,  as  well  as  an  easy  solution  to  waste  disposal.  The  upper  and  middle \nreaches alone account for 80% of the YREB\u2019s total wastewater discharge.7 For instance, more \nthan 50% of the chemical enterprises in the PRC are located along the Yangtze River Basin. Such \na chemically dominated industrial structure creates a high level of water safety risks for millions \nof  people  who  live  along  the  river. 8 Urbanization  and  industrialization  have  caused  massive \nadverse  environmental  impacts  that  are  now  beyond  the  limits  of  the  YREB\u2019s  environmental \ncarrying capacity. The importance of urban infrastructure and services remains high, especially \nin the less-developed parts of the YREB. \n\n5. \nGiven the lack of local jobs in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB, about 22% of \nthe 389 million total population\u2014or 86 million laborers\u2014left their hometowns and their families to \nseek work in the coastal cities.9 Qualified younger people, in particular, had to migrate in search \nof high-technology jobs because many of their home cities have stagnated: poor management \ncapacity, labor skills, and policies, as well as reliance on resource-intensive and low-technology \nindustries  left  them  unable  to  shift  to  high-quality  development.10 The  YREB  governments  are \nunder  immense  pressure  to  create  an  enabling  environment;  and  have  issued  policies  and \ndirectives to help curb outmigration through tax, financial, training, and other incentives.11 \n\n6. \nTo promote such development in the upper and middle reaches of the YREB, ADB has \nworked  in  partnership  with  the  central  and  local  governments  under  the  framework  approach \n(para.  3)  to  explore  high-quality  development  models  for  replication.

Manila. \n\n7  The YREB produces about 81% of the  PRC\u2019s chemical fibers, 59% of cloth, 58% of chemical pesticides, 51% of \nfertilizers, and 48% of cement, which has come at significant environmental costs. http://english.mep.gov.cn/.shtml. \n8  The three major sources of pollution in the Yangtze River  are (i) domestic\u2014from domestic wastewater discharge; \n(ii) industrial\u2014from heavy industries established around the water systems in the YREB; and (iii) agricultural\u2014from \nincreasingly large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides discharged  in the form of nonpoint source pollution. Many \nsmall and medium-sized chemical and other heavily polluting plants that did not comply with national environmental \nstandards have now been shut down thanks to stricter environmental enforcement along the Yangtze River. \n\n9  The PRC has a large migrant worker population of 171.85 million (2017), and Sichuan Province has the largest share \n\namong the provinces with 11.75 million migrant workers. \n\n10 At the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held on 16 January 2018, it was stated that \u201cChina\u2019s \n\neconomy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.\u201d \n\n11 Since 2016, social protection policies have been issued to encourage migrant workers to return home for work. These \npolicies include (i) payment of wage arrears; (ii) financial aid for business start-ups; (iii) housing and/or rental and \nmedical benefits; and (iv) training on modern agricultural methods, electronic commerce, and entrepreneurship.

Beijing. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fassistance  project  for  the  YREB, 12 ADB  and  the  government  identified  two  cities  in  the  upper \nreaches of the YREB\u2014the Chongqing and Ziyang municipalities\u2014as suitable candidates for the \npartnership.13 These two municipalities are of different scales and stages of development, which \nshowcases the problems that many cities in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are faced \nwith in their economic transition to a high-quality, more inclusive development path. \n\n7. \nZiyang is a typical medium-sized prefecture-level municipality in the upper reaches of the \nYREB, with a population of 3.6 million in 2017; average income per capita of $2,900; and a land \narea of 5,747 square kilometers, covering hilly terrain traditionally used for agriculture. Its center \nspans both sides of the Tuo River, which is a major tributary of the Yangtze River. The Sichuan \nZiyang  High  Technology  Development  Zone  (SZHTDZ)  is  centrally  located  in  Ziyang  and \nintegrated in its urban and most economically developed area. An economy dominated by heavy \nindustries  for  decades  has  substantially  burdened  the  Tuo  River. 14  Ziyang\u2019s  conventional \nindustrial structure and the increasingly stricter enforcement of environmental laws and policies \nhave led to an unstable job market that cannot meet the growing demand of the local people. The \nZMG needs to do more to create more local jobs for its people. It needs support to (i) tackle the \ntask  of  improving  the  damaged  ecological  environment;  (ii)  shift  the  local  economy  from  its \nreliance on heavy manufacturing to a high-quality development path based on services, which \ncan  help  create  a  reliable  job  market;  and  (iii) improve  its  urban  development  planning  and \nmanagement. \n\n8. \nEnvironmental  degradation.  The  past  industrialization  and  the  resulting  increase  in \nwastewater discharge and air pollution have put Ziyang\u2019s environment under pressure. Changes \nin land use resulted in riverbank erosion, flood risks, and  decreased vegetation, all of which is \naggravated by the global climate change. Most of the water quality in Ziyang\u2019s rivers and lakes is \nalready  in  Class  IV  or  V  at  various locations.15 The urban  area grew  significantly  as  economic \nactivity intensified, and the landfill site, a polluted water body that includes Yannan Lake, is now \npart of Ziyang\u2019s urban center. Immediate action is needed to rehabilitate the ecological situation; \nprovide green spaces; and boost water quality, stormwater management, and livability. In general, \necological restoration, pollution reduction, and improvement of the water quality of the Tuo River \nare part of the national endeavor to promote ecological protection and green development in the \nYREB.  A  restored  ecology  will  improve  Ziyang\u2019s  livability,  which  will  not  only  raise  the  living \nstandards of its residents; but also encourage investors and highly skilled talents to establish their \nbusinesses here, thus further promoting Ziyang\u2019s economic diversification. \n\n9. \nLack of specialized support to promote the service industry and local job creation. \nShifting the growth engine from heavy industries to the service industry is essential for Ziyang\u2019s \neconomic  transition.  Through  its  comparative  advantage  both  on  improvement  of  urban \nenvironment  and  livability,  and  its  location  within  the  Chengdu\u2013Chongqing  city  cluster,  Ziyang \naims to develop and diversify a service industry (e.g., health, aviation, hospitality, leisure sports, \n                                                \n12 ADB.  2015.

The project \ncan  support  this  by  (i) showcasing  the  improvement  in  specialized  public  services;  and  (ii) \nassisting the private sector by helping remove major hurdles such as (a) the high costs of research \nand development (R&D) that discourage enterprises from venturing into light industry, and (b) the \ninadequacy  of  inspection  and  testing  capacity  that  prevents  the  timely  market  launch  of \nproducts.17 Ziyang  has  about  1.1 million  migrant  workers,  representing  a  third  of  its  3.6  million \npopulation. It also has substantial gaps in human resource skills because of the limited relevance \nof its technical and vocational education and training (TVET) program, which hampers its efforts \ntowards its development.18 The enterprises in the SZHTDZ need large numbers of skilled workers. \nThe project\u2019s TVET interventions are essential for reskilling returning migrants; and providing the \nlocal people, including the poor and women, with jobs in the upcoming service industry. \n\n10. \nFragmented  urban  development  planning  and  management.  Urban  development \nplanning  and  management  is  crucial  for  achieving  the  goal  of  inclusive  green  development, \ni.e., the  transition  from  highly  polluting  heavy  industries  to  environment-friendly  services.  Like \nmany  other  cities  in  the  PRC,  Ziyang  has  a  complex  but  fragmented  urban  planning  and \nmanagement  system  involving  various  line  agencies.  The  ZMG  does  not  have  an  effective \nmechanism to share the integrated data and information. It relies on a complex interagency review \nand coordination process to facilitate its urban planning. As the local economy expands, the ZMG \nwill face more administrative and environmental management challenges, which require stronger \nurban  development  planning  and  management  systems.  Hence,  support  for  state-of-the-art, \ninformation technology  (IT)-based  planning  and  performance monitoring and  evaluation  (M&E) \nsystems is essential. Women\u2019s participation in management and employment is also crucial, and \ngender  mainstreaming  under  the  project  will  help  ensure  this.  In  sum,  for  Ziyang  to  meet  its \nurbanization  needs,  it  is  vital  to  (i)  bridge  the  gap  between  urban  development  planning  and \nenvironmental management; and (ii) improve the financing for such development initiatives. \n\n11. \nStrategic fit. The project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020  the  Outline  of  the  YREB  Development  Plan,  2016\u20132030  (footnote  4). 19 The  project  is \nparticularly  aligned  with  the  guidelines  on  the  Yangtze  River  Basin\u2019s  economic  development \nissued by the State Council in 2014 to promote inclusive green development with stricter pollution \ncontrol,  environmental  rehabilitation  and  protection,  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement.  The  project  will  directly  contribute  to  the  national  endeavor  of  restoring  the \necological system of the Yangtze River and fostering inclusive green development in the entire \nYREB. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, \nparticularly in promoting urban inclusive green development for small- and medium-sized cities in \nthe less-developed regions.20 The project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \n                                                \n16 Promoting  Inclusive  Green  Development  and  Economic  Diversification  at  the  Upper  Reach  of  the  Yangtze  River \n\nEconomic Belt (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17 ADB  will  support  public  facilities  such  as  an  R&D  center  and  a  center  for  inspecting  and  testing  equipment  and \n\nmaterials to promote job creation in light industries. \n\n18 In 2017, there are about eight among the 24 TVET categories that are with priority, i. e., preschool education, tourism \nservice  and  management,  automobile  manufacturing  and  maintenance,  electronic  commerce,  vehicle  use  and \nmaintenance, clothing design and processing technology, machine processing technology, and computer application. \nThe relevance of TVET in Ziyang needs to be aligned with its emerging service and light industry businesses. \n\n19 Government  of  the  PRC.  2016.

The  project  design  incorporates  key  lessons  from  previous  ADB  and \ndevelopment partner projects as well as international best practices and innovative approaches.23 \nThese  emphasize  (i)  the  importance  of  regionally  balanced,  inclusive  green  development  for \nsustainable  growth;  (ii)  the  need  for  innovative  technology  and  standards  to  improve  urban \ndevelopment, \nfor  ecosystem  restoration  and  environmental \ndegradation;  and  (iii)  the  need  to  provide  effective  institutional  arrangements  and  government \nmanagement systems. \n\nincluding  sound  solutions \n\n13. \nValue addition of ADB assistance. Through its capacity building and state-of-the-art IT-\nbased  SMART  information  system,  the  project  will  enable  the  sharing  of  experiences,  best \npractices,  and  innovation.24 The  use  of  advanced  technologies  under  the  project\u2019s  ecological \nrenovation  and  environmental  sustainability  will  showcase  important  elements  of  ADB\u2019s \nengagement with the PRC (e.g., regional public goods, climate change, urbanization, and regional \ncooperation  and  integration).  The  project  features  a  comprehensive  approach  to  stopping \nenvironmental degradation and improving urban livability in Ziyang through integrated solid waste \nand wastewater management.25 The project will be the first ADB initiative to transform a landfill \nsite  into  a  green  park  and  introduce  an  M&E  system  to  measure  the  progress  of  urban \ndevelopment. 26  The  experience  and  knowledge  gained  from  wetland  rehabilitation,  landfill \ntransformation,  and  sustainable  city  development  under  this  project  can  be  replicated  in  other \ncities along the Yangtze River Basin in the PRC, and also in other developing member countries \nin Asia and the Pacific. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental improvement in the YREB achieved (footnote 4). The project will have the following \noutcome: economic and environmental conditions in Ziyang and the SZHTDZ improved.27 \n                                                \n21 ADB.  2018.

A \nSMART city solution is a system that spans the entire process (integrated approach) from strategic planning, design, \nimplementation, operation, and management of urban spaces to M&E. Focused on information and communication \ntechnology aspects and data systems for improved urban management, the SMART city can also (i) enable a more \nefficient use of resources; (ii) improve equitable access to infrastructure and services; (iii) facilitate the interaction of \npeople  and  businesses;  (iv)  enhance  the  physical  and  virtual  flow  of  goods,  capital,  information,  resources, \nand people;  (v)  strengthen  capacity  building  and  knowledge  sharing;  (vi)  boost  urban  resilience;  (vii)  make  the \ngovernment and its governance more transparent and accountable; and (viii) improve a city\u2019s overall livability. \n\n25 Green  livable  cities  are  climate-  and  disaster-resilient,  resource-efficient,  economically  vibrant  and  competitive, \nsocially  inclusive,  equitable,  tolerant,  access-oriented,  with  good-quality  public  open  spaces,  affordable,  healthy, \nwalkable, and amenable to different groups of people. \n\n26 This is the first ADB-financed urban development project in the PRC that will introduce an IT-based management \n\nsystem. \n\n27 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nOutput  1:  Ecological  systems  and  environmental  infrastructure  constructed. This \noutput  will  help  stem  the  degradation  of  public  infrastructure  by  rehabilitating  and  developing \nurban environmental infrastructure. This includes (i) building 5 kilometers of \u201ceco-dike\u201d or flood-\ncontrol embankment to comply with the requirement for protection against a 1-in-50-years flood \nevent; (ii) building an 18-hectare (ha) area of \"sponge city\" interventions to capture stormwater;28 \n(iii) developing and protecting a 25.7 ha wetland area to improve Yannan Lake\u2019s water quality and \nenhance the ecological system; (iv) closing a landfill and transforming the land into 38.6 ha of \ngreen park; (v) creating a green wedge on 123 ha of undeveloped hills and gullies as a natural \nbarrier between Ziyang\u2019s old residential and industrial areas; and (vi) preserving the ecology of \neight bare hills that are at risk of erosion.29 \n\n16. \nOutput 2: Facilities and programs to support the service industry broadened. This \noutput will remove obstacles to Ziyang\u2019s emergence as a high-quality and more inclusive green \ndevelopment in the SZHTDZ. This includes establishing (i) an R&D center for light industries; (ii) a \ncenter  for  inspecting  and  testing  equipment  and  materials;  and  (iii)  the  Sichuan  Ziyang  TVET \ncenter, with capacity for 4,000 full-time students. Items (i) and (ii) are envisioned to reduce the \ntime  it  takes  for  a  product  to  reach  the  market  and  will  be  guided  by  existing  institutional \nframeworks  in  the  PRC.  Item  (iii)  will  raise  the  relevance  and  quality  of  secondary  TVET  with \nupdated  curricula,  a  better  qualification  framework,  upgraded  accreditation  and  assessment \nsystems, and capacity development for teachers and management. The mid-career workforce will \nbe able to access skills re-training and lifelong learning courses; and the younger generations will \nbenefit from full-time TVET training.30 \n\nOutput 3: Urban development planning and management capacity enhanced. This \n17. \noutput  will  overhaul  the  outdated  and  inefficient  systems  for  urban  development  planning  and \nmanagement, and performance M&E. It includes (i) installing a computerized urban development \nplanning and management component (intelligent park platform\u2014a SMART information system\u2014\nthat  provides  modular,  web-based,  interactive,  and  decision-making  support  for  better \nmanagement of government operations, the environment, and information sharing); (ii) setting up \nan  effective  urban  performance  M&E  system  for  the  SZHTDZ;  and  (iii)  undertaking  a \ncomprehensive study on urban green development planning, including a comprehensive gender \nstudy, for the SZHTDZ. The information system will be equipped with state-of-the-art hardware \nand software to support a government data management and office system, economy (one-stop \nenterprise service platform) to promote electronic commerce within Ziyang, management support \nsystem, and environmental system. The information system also helps in setting up a government \nservices  system  in  the  SZHTDZ  that  improves  efficiency,  transparency,  resource sharing,  and \nmanagement.  All  systems  will  be  monitored  throughout  implementation  along  clearly  defined \nperformance-based benchmarks. \n\n                                                \n28 Sponge city refers to a city that is designed to passively absorb, clean, and use rainfall. The sponge city interventions \nrefer  to  the  replacement  of  concrete  pavements  with  wetlands,  green  rooftops,  and  rain  gardens  to  absorb  the \nstormwater back into the land, making it work for the city instead of against it.  \n\n29 This entails the construction of a riverside embankment to protect the SZHTDZ, and land for recreational facilities. \n30 Government of the PRC. 2010.

The  SZHTDZ  Administrative  Committee  and  the  Ziyang  Municipal \nEducation  and  Sports  Bureau  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  Ziyang  Development  Zone \nInvestment Co., Ltd. is the project implementation unit. The ZMG has established a project leading \ngroup and a project management office. The procurement regulations to be used during project \nimplementation will be ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).

The \nproject design meets the PRC standards and incorporates an innovative and modern industrial \nsystem  as well  as  climate  change adaptation  measures.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Development \nand  Reform  Commission  confirmed  the  technical  feasibility  to  be  adequate  after  detailed \nexamination  of  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local  conditions  and  capacity  for  operation  and \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fmaintenance.  The  capacity  development  program  is  based  on  a  needs  assessment  for  the \nsustainable operation of the project. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic analysis follows ADB\u2019s guidelines.32 Economic benefits are (i) accelerated \n24. \ngrowth in the service industry, (ii) greater efficiencies (time savings) in the testing of equipment, \n(iii) incremental human capital measured by the wage increase of TVET graduates, (iv) stronger \nflood protection, and (v) the environmental benefits of various urban inclusive green infrastructure \nsubprojects.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  at  14.84%  (above  the  9.0% \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital),  which  drops  to  13.66%  if  the  capital  cost  increases  by \n10.0%;  to  14.71%  if  the  operating  cost  increases  by  10.0%;  to  13.41%  with  a  10.0%  benefit \ndecrease; and to 12.16% under the combined scenarios. \n\n25. \nThe  financial  sustainability  assessment  indicates  that  the  ZMG  had  sufficient  funds  to \nfinance the counterpart contributions; and pay the debt service and operation and maintenance \ncosts during operation. In 2016, for example, the ZMG\u2019s revenues amount to CNY25.3 billion, of \nwhich 45.8% are upper-level government allocations. Its share of the counterpart funds amounts \nto  1.2%  of  its  annual  revenue  during  construction.  The  loan  principal  and  interest  repayment \namount will account for about 0.15% of the fiscal expenditure in the first year of operation. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe  financial  management  risk  before  considering  mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, a moderate control risk, and a comparatively high \nlevel  of  financial  management  capacities.  Measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  are  in  the  financial \nmanagement  assessment. 33  The  overall  project  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  The  project \nimplementation  unit  does  not  have  experience  in  procurement for foreign-funded  projects,  and \nthere  are  differences  between  the  procurement  practices  of  ADB  and the  ZMG.34 Measures  to \nmitigate the risks are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  ZMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 31). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n28. \nThe project is classified as a general intervention for poverty reduction. It will contribute to \nsocioeconomic development and poverty reduction by increasing access to (i) jobs during project \nconstruction and operation; (ii) new jobs in the service and light industries; (iii) skills training based \non  an  updated  TVET  curriculum;  and  (iv)  a  better  living  environment.  The  project  will  directly \nbenefit 270,000 residents of the seven project towns in Yanjiang District, including 1,618 urban \nand 5,547 rural poor people. The district\u2019s remaining 840,000 residents will indirectly benefit. The \nZMG  prepared  a  social  development  action  plan  based  on  a  poverty  and  social  analysis  that \nincluded stakeholder consultations. The plan outlines further participation during implementation. \n\n                                                \n32 The economic internal rates of return were not calculated for output 1 because its benefits are not quantifiable. \n33 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThe  project\u2019s  gender  category  is  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  contribute  to \n29. \ngender  equality  and  inclusion  by  increasing  women\u2019s  access  to  jobs  during  construction  and \noperation, particularly of ecological systems and environmental infrastructure. Attracting the best \nmale  and  female  talent  will  be  critical  to  transforming  Ziyang  into  a  hub  of  innovation  in  high-\ntechnology  and  green  industries.  The  project  will  seek  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \nprofessional women to seek jobs or business opportunities in the SZHTDZ, including assessing \noptions  to  enhance  women\u2019s  employment  and  job  retention,  job  progression,  and  career \ndevelopment.  The  project  will  support  information  campaigns  to  promote  female  students\u2019 \nenrollment in technical fields in the Sichuan Ziyang TVET center. The executing and implementing \nagencies will ensure gender action plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \ncategories are as follows:37 \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement  (2009),36 the project\u2019s safeguard \n\nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  ZMG  prepared  an  environmental  impact  assessment \n31. \n(EIA)  report,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  in  line  with  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The EIA and EMP are based on the approved domestic feasibility study reports \nand  environmental  assessments,  site  visits,  and  stakeholder  consultations.  Consultations \nincluded affected people and local government agencies, and the outcomes were integrated in \nthe project design. The draft EIA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2018. The ZMG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for compliance with the EMP. \n\nThe project is expected to significantly contribute to municipal targets for environmental \n32. \nimprovement, e.g., (i) improved water quality of the Tuo River and avoided flood damage thanks \nto  efficient  stormwater  collection  and  the  capture  of  point  and  nonpoint  source  pollution;  and \n(ii) improved groundwater protection, as well as greater health and safety of residents thanks to \nthe remediation of a landfill site. Construction and/or operational risks include the potential release \nof  contaminants  from  polluted  sediments  during  dredging  or  disposal,  and  leachate  or  gas \nemissions from the landfill site after remediation. Mitigation measures include the procedures for \nlandfill management, and the safe collection and disposal of the dredged sediments. The project \nis  expected  to  be  an  important  demonstration  project  on  how  medium-sized  cities  can  help  in \nenvironmental rehabilitation and transformation. Hence, with effective EMP implementation and \nprescribed training, the result will be residual impacts within the limits of the PRC\u2019s standards as \ndefined in the EMP. \n\n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project will occupy 4,265.06 mu of land\u2014\n1,183.8  mu  of  existing  state-owned  land,  1,540.98  mu  of  collective  land  to  be  acquired,  and \n1,540.28 mu of collective land through the land use rights transfer (LURT).38 Residential houses \non 39,610 square meters and non-residential structures of 28 entities (31,030 square meters) will \nbe demolished. In total, 1,482 households and entities with 4,737 persons will be affected. The \nZMG prepared a resettlement plan in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and with laws and \nregulations  of  the  PRC  and  local  governments.  The  resettlement  plan  contains  adequate \nmeasures of compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for affected people. It also includes \nthe  due  diligence  report  for  past  land  acquisition  and  the  LURT  framework  for  future  LURT \ncontracts. The ZMG held consultations with affected people and village committees, who will also \nbe  consulted  during  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  included  in  the \n                                                \n36 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf. \n37 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n38 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 0.067 hectares or 666.67 square meters). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fresettlement plan. The executing and implementing agencies have experience in resettlement; \nthey  will  carry  out  the  internal  monitoring,  engage  an  external  monitoring  agency,  and  have \ncommitted  to  implement  and monitor  the  resettlement  plan  by  allocating  adequate  budget  and \nhuman  resources.  These  agencies  have  the  capacity  for  managing  resettlement  under \ndomestically financed projects. To implement this project\u2019s resettlement plan, their capacity will \nbe strengthened through consulting services and training. \n\n34. \nIndigenous  peoples  or  ethnic  minorities  (category  C).  The  project  does  not  involve \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minority  villages  or  communities  that  would  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements  on  indigenous  peoples.
