THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Sichuan Ziyang Inclusive Green Development \nProject. The project will provide strategic and comprehensive support for the Ziyang Municipal \nGovernment (ZMG) to (i) improve the urban environment and livability of Ziyang Municipality \n(Ziyang), and (ii) shift to high-quality economic growth on a more inclusive green development \npath.1 The project is envisaged to play a demonstrative role for medium-sized cities with similar \nconditions in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB).2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The YREB is one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC.3 Its nine provinces \nand two specially administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the population, 40% \nof freshwater resources, and about 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While the YREB has \nbenefited from extensive development since the late 1980s, particularly in the eastern delta area, \neconomic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin lags behind that of \nthe coastal areas and is below its potential. These parts of the YREB still face significant \ndevelopment challenges as a result of (i) increasing pollution and pressure on natural resources; \n(ii)  slow  transformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification;  (iii)  limited \nintegration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional coordination \nfor strategic planning. The YREB faces a growing imbalance between economic achievement and \nenvironmental quality. \n3.  To  manage  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \n \ndevelopment plan 2016\u20132030, which stipulates the prioritization of ecological protection and \npromotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB\u2019s future growth.4 Inclusive \ngreen  development  aims  to  shift  from  a  traditional,  subsector  approach  to  a  crosscutting, \nintegrated approach leading to a sustainable development model; solve the challenges of rapid \nurbanization; and serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. In this context, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach, \nproviding about $2.0 billion of funding in the YREB during 2018\u20132020 to strategically program \nADB\u2019s lending support for development initiatives in the YREB. In doing so, priority is given to the \nfollowing four areas: (i) ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, and management of \nwater resources; (ii) inclusive green industrial transformation; (iii) construction of an integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional strengthening and policy reform. The project \n                                                \n1  Inclusive green development is defined as an integrated approach encompassing sustainable, resilient, accessible, \nand affordable solutions to the challenges faced by the urban poor and vulnerable groups by enhancing their access \nto urban services and infrastructure through targeted investments. This integrated approach encourages an \ninstitutional delivery mechanism that brings together all institutions and stakeholders\u2014government, the private \nsector, and civil society\u2014that have the capacity to deliver systems for inclusive urban service delivery.

Yangtze River \nEconomic Belt Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation Project\u2014A Preliminary Study. Manila (TA 9044-PRC, \nconsultant\u2019s report). \n2  A demonstrative role requires social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic competitiveness with local \nfinancial soundness and sustainability. \n3  The other two key economic growth engines in the PRC are the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei integrated regional \ndevelopment strategy and the belt and road initiative. \n4  Government of the PRC. 2016. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n ", "2 \nwill be the first in the PRC to showcase such economic development and diversification for cities \nand municipalities in the upper and middle reaches of the YREB, tackling the dual challenges of \nurbanization  and  environmental  degradation.  The  project\u2019s  emphasis  on  balanced  regional \nurbanization and inclusive green growth ensures that development considers the needs of all \npopulation groups, with a particular focus on providing affordable, sustainable, resilient, and \naccessible services to women, and poor and marginalized people.5 \n4.  The Yangtze River is coming under increasing pressure from rapid economic growth and \nurbanization. In 2015, the discharge of treated wastewater into the Yangtze River totaled an \nestimated 34.7 billion tons, of which 43.61% was domestic wastewater and 56.39% industrial \nwastewater.6 Since 1978, numerous industries have been developed along the Yangtze River \nand its tributaries, taking advantage of the waterway as an easy access to water resources and \nlow-cost transportation, as well as an easy solution to waste disposal. The upper and middle \nreaches alone account for 80% of the YREB\u2019s total wastewater discharge.7 For instance, more \nthan 50% of the chemical enterprises in the PRC are located along the Yangtze River Basin. Such \na chemically dominated industrial structure creates a high level of water safety risks for millions \nof people who live along the river.8 Urbanization and industrialization have caused massive \nadverse environmental impacts that are now beyond the limits of the YREB\u2019s environmental \ncarrying capacity. The importance of urban infrastructure and services remains high, especially \nin the less-developed parts of the YREB. \n5.  Given the lack of local jobs in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB, about 22% of \nthe 389 million total population\u2014or 86 million laborers\u2014left their hometowns and their families to \nseek work in the coastal cities.9 Qualified younger people, in particular, had to migrate in search \nof high-technology jobs because many of their home cities have stagnated: poor management \ncapacity, labor skills, and policies, as well as reliance on resource-intensive and low-technology \nindustries left them unable to shift to high-quality development.10 The YREB governments are \nunder immense pressure to create an enabling environment; and have issued policies and \ndirectives to help curb outmigration through tax, financial, training, and other incentives.11 \n6.  To promote such development in the upper and middle reaches of the YREB, ADB has \nworked in partnership with the central and local governments under the framework approach \n(para.  3)  to  explore  high-quality  development  models  for  replication.  Through  a  technical \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017. Enabling Inclusive Cities, Tool Kit for Inclusive Urban Development. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2018. Framework for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for the Yangtze River Economic Belt Initiative: \n2018\u20132020. Manila. \n7  The YREB produces about 81% of the PRC\u2019s chemical fibers, 59% of cloth, 58% of chemical pesticides, 51% of \nfertilizers, and 48% of cement, which has come at significant environmental costs. http://english.mep.gov.cn/.shtml. \n8  The three major sources of pollution in the Yangtze River are (i) domestic\u2014from domestic wastewater discharge; \n(ii) industrial\u2014from heavy industries established around the water systems in the YREB; and (iii) agricultural\u2014from \nincreasingly large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides discharged in the form of nonpoint source pollution. Many \nsmall and medium-sized chemical and other heavily polluting plants that did not comply with national environmental \nstandards have now been shut down thanks to stricter environmental enforcement along the Yangtze River. \n9  The PRC has a large migrant worker population of 171.85 million (2017), and Sichuan Province has the largest share \namong the provinces with 11.75 million migrant workers. \n10 At the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held on 16 January 2018, it was stated that \u201cChina\u2019s \neconomy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.\u201d \n11 Since 2016, social protection policies have been issued to encourage migrant workers to return home for work. These \npolicies include (i) payment of wage arrears; (ii) financial aid for business start-ups; (iii) housing and/or rental and \nmedical benefits; and (iv) training on modern agricultural methods, electronic commerce, and entrepreneurship. State \nCouncil. 2016. Protection Policies for Rural Labors Including Migrant Workers. Beijing. \n \n ", "3 \nassistance project for the YREB, 12 ADB and the government identified two cities in the upper \nreaches of the YREB\u2014the Chongqing and Ziyang municipalities\u2014as suitable candidates for the \npartnership.13 These two municipalities are of different scales and stages of development, which \nshowcases the problems that many cities in the middle and upper reaches of the YREB are faced \nwith in their economic transition to a high-quality, more inclusive development path. \n7.  Ziyang is a typical medium-sized prefecture-level municipality in the upper reaches of the \nYREB, with a population of 3.6 million in 2017; average income per capita of $2,900; and a land \narea of 5,747 square kilometers, covering hilly terrain traditionally used for agriculture. Its center \nspans both sides of the Tuo River, which is a major tributary of the Yangtze River. The Sichuan \nZiyang  High  Technology  Development  Zone  (SZHTDZ)  is  centrally  located  in  Ziyang  and \nintegrated in its urban and most economically developed area. An economy dominated by heavy \nindustries  for  decades  has  substantially  burdened  the  Tuo  River.14 Ziyang\u2019s  conventional \nindustrial structure and the increasingly stricter enforcement of environmental laws and policies \nhave led to an unstable job market that cannot meet the growing demand of the local people. The \nZMG needs to do more to create more local jobs for its people. It needs support to (i) tackle the \ntask of improving the damaged ecological environment; (ii) shift the local economy from its \nreliance on heavy manufacturing to a high-quality development path based on services, which \ncan help create a reliable job market; and (iii) improve its urban development planning and \nmanagement. \n8.  Environmental degradation. The past industrialization and the resulting increase in \nwastewater discharge and air pollution have put Ziyang\u2019s environment under pressure. Changes \nin land use resulted in riverbank erosion, flood risks, and decreased vegetation, all of which is \naggravated by the global climate change. Most of the water quality in Ziyang\u2019s rivers and lakes is \nalready in Class IV or V at various locations.15 The urban area grew significantly as economic \nactivity intensified, and the landfill site, a polluted water body that includes Yannan Lake, is now \npart of Ziyang\u2019s urban center. Immediate action is needed to rehabilitate the ecological situation; \nprovide green spaces; and boost water quality, stormwater management, and livability. In general, \necological restoration, pollution reduction, and improvement of the water quality of the Tuo River \nare part of the national endeavor to promote ecological protection and green development in the \nYREB. A restored ecology will improve Ziyang\u2019s livability, which will not only raise the living \nstandards of its residents; but also encourage investors and highly skilled talents to establish their \nbusinesses here, thus further promoting Ziyang\u2019s economic diversification. \n9.  Lack of specialized support to promote the service industry and local job creation. \nShifting the growth engine from heavy industries to the service industry is essential for Ziyang\u2019s \neconomic  transition.  Through  its  comparative  advantage  both  on  improvement  of  urban \nenvironment and livability, and its location within the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing city cluster, Ziyang \naims to develop and diversify a service industry (e.g., health, aviation, hospitality, leisure sports, \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2015.

The project \ncan support this by (i) showcasing the improvement in specialized public services; and (ii) \nassisting the private sector by helping remove major hurdles such as (a) the high costs of research \nand development (R&D) that discourage enterprises from venturing into light industry, and (b) the \ninadequacy  of  inspection  and  testing  capacity  that  prevents  the  timely  market  launch  of \nproducts.17 Ziyang has about 1.1 million migrant workers, representing a third of its 3.6 million \npopulation. It also has substantial gaps in human resource skills because of the limited relevance \nof its technical and vocational education and training (TVET) program, which hampers its efforts \ntowards its development.18 The enterprises in the SZHTDZ need large numbers of skilled workers. \nThe project\u2019s TVET interventions are essential for reskilling returning migrants; and providing the \nlocal people, including the poor and women, with jobs in the upcoming service industry. \n10.  Fragmented urban development planning and management. Urban development \nplanning and management is crucial for achieving the goal of inclusive green development, \ni.e., the transition from highly polluting heavy industries to environment-friendly services. Like \nmany  other  cities  in  the  PRC,  Ziyang  has  a complex  but fragmented  urban  planning  and \nmanagement system involving various line agencies. The ZMG does not have an effective \nmechanism to share the integrated data and information. It relies on a complex interagency review \nand coordination process to facilitate its urban planning. As the local economy expands, the ZMG \nwill face more administrative and environmental management challenges, which require stronger \nurban development planning and management systems. Hence, support for state-of-the-art, \ninformation technology (IT)-based planning and performance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nsystems is essential. Women\u2019s participation in management and employment is also crucial, and \ngender mainstreaming under the project will help ensure this. In sum, for Ziyang to meet its \nurbanization needs, it is vital to (i) bridge the gap between urban development planning and \nenvironmental management; and (ii) improve the financing for such development initiatives. \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020 the Outline of the YREB Development Plan, 2016\u20132030 (footnote 4).19 The project is \nparticularly aligned with the guidelines on the Yangtze River Basin\u2019s economic development \nissued by the State Council in 2014 to promote inclusive green development with stricter pollution \ncontrol,  environmental  rehabilitation  and  protection,  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement.  The  project  will  directly  contribute  to  the  national  endeavor  of  restoring  the \necological system of the Yangtze River and fostering inclusive green development in the entire \nYREB. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, \nparticularly in promoting urban inclusive green development for small- and medium-sized cities in \nthe less-developed regions.20 The project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \n                                                \n16 Promoting Inclusive Green Development and Economic Diversification at the Upper Reach of the Yangtze River \nEconomic Belt (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB will support public facilities such as an R&D center and a center for inspecting and testing equipment and \nmaterials to promote job creation in light industries. \n18 In 2017, there are about eight among the 24 TVET categories that are with priority, i. e., preschool education, tourism \nservice and management, automobile manufacturing and maintenance, electronic commerce, vehicle use and \nmaintenance, clothing design and processing technology, machine processing technology, and computer application. \nThe relevance of TVET in Ziyang needs to be aligned with its emerging service and light industry businesses. \n19 Government of the PRC. 2016.

Lessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  key  lessons  from  previous  ADB  and \ndevelopment partner projects as well as international best practices and innovative approaches.23 \nThese emphasize (i) the importance of regionally balanced, inclusive green development for \nsustainable growth; (ii) the need for innovative technology and standards to improve urban \ndevelopment,  including  sound  solutions  for  ecosystem  restoration  and  environmental \ndegradation; and (iii) the need to provide effective institutional arrangements and government \nmanagement systems. \n13.  Value addition of ADB assistance. Through its capacity building and state-of-the-art IT-\nbased SMART information system, the project will enable the sharing of experiences, best \npractices, and innovation.24 The use of advanced technologies under the project\u2019s ecological \nrenovation  and  environmental  sustainability  will  showcase  important  elements  of  ADB\u2019s \nengagement with the PRC (e.g., regional public goods, climate change, urbanization, and regional \ncooperation  and  integration).  The  project  features  a  comprehensive  approach  to  stopping \nenvironmental degradation and improving urban livability in Ziyang through integrated solid waste \nand wastewater management.25 The project will be the first ADB initiative to transform a landfill \nsite  into  a  green  park  and  introduce  an  M&E  system  to  measure  the  progress  of  urban \ndevelopment.26 The  experience  and  knowledge  gained  from  wetland  rehabilitation,  landfill \ntransformation, and sustainable city development under this project can be replicated in other \ncities along the Yangtze River Basin in the PRC, and also in other developing member countries \nin Asia and the Pacific. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental improvement in the YREB achieved (footnote 4). The project will have the following \noutcome: economic and environmental conditions in Ziyang and the SZHTDZ improved.27 \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2018.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The ZMG is the executing agency and will supervise, coordinate, and manage the project. \nThe Sichuan Provincial Finance Department will manage the advance account and support \nfinancial  management.  The  SZHTDZ  Administrative  Committee  and  the  Ziyang  Municipal \nEducation and Sports Bureau are the implementing agencies. The Ziyang Development Zone \nInvestment Co., Ltd. is the project implementation unit. The ZMG has established a project leading \ngroup and a project management office. The procurement regulations to be used during project \nimplementation will be ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The methods \nfor selecting consultants will be quality- and cost-based, consultant\u2019s qualification, and individual \nconsultant  selections.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 31). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project leading group \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ziyang Municipal Government \n(iii)  Key implementing  - Sichuan Ziyang High Technology Development Zone Administrative Committee \nagencies  - Ziyang Municipal Education and Sports Bureau \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management office \nProject implementation unit: Ziyang Development Zone Investment Co., Ltd. \nProcurement  OCB (AI)  4 contracts  $49.27 million \nOCB (AN)  14 contracts  $169.90 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  274 person-months (4 contracts)  $3.42 million \nCQS  60 person-months (3 contracts)  $0.65 million \n  ICS  16 person-months  $0.16 million \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting and retroactive financing will apply to the recruitment of two \nand/or advance contracting  individual consultant packages for (i) start-up project implementation activities (four \nspecialists); (ii) preparation of the technical specifications of research and \ndevelopment, and testing equipment (two specialists); and (iii) project management \nsupport.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The project was prepared in accordance with the PRC\u2019s guidelines and regulations. The \nproject design meets the PRC standards and incorporates an innovative and modern industrial \nsystem as well as climate change adaptation measures. The Sichuan Provincial Development \nand  Reform  Commission  confirmed  the  technical  feasibility  to  be  adequate  after  detailed \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and capacity for operation and \n ", "9 \nmaintenance. The capacity development program is based on a needs assessment for the \nsustainable operation of the project. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The economic analysis follows ADB\u2019s guidelines.32 Economic benefits are (i) accelerated \ngrowth in the service industry, (ii) greater efficiencies (time savings) in the testing of equipment, \n(iii) incremental human capital measured by the wage increase of TVET graduates, (iv) stronger \nflood protection, and (v) the environmental benefits of various urban inclusive green infrastructure \nsubprojects. The economic internal rate of return was calculated at 14.84% (above the 9.0% \neconomic opportunity cost of capital), which drops to 13.66% if the capital cost increases by \n10.0%; to 14.71% if the operating cost increases by 10.0%; to 13.41% with a 10.0% benefit \ndecrease; and to 12.16% under the combined scenarios. \n25.  The financial sustainability assessment indicates that the ZMG had sufficient funds to \nfinance the counterpart contributions; and pay the debt service and operation and maintenance \ncosts during operation. In 2016, for example, the ZMG\u2019s revenues amount to CNY25.3 billion, of \nwhich 45.8% are upper-level government allocations. Its share of the counterpart funds amounts \nto 1.2% of its annual revenue during construction. The loan principal and interest repayment \namount will account for about 0.15% of the fiscal expenditure in the first year of operation. \nC.  Governance \n26.  The financial management risk  before  considering mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, a moderate control risk, and a comparatively high \nlevel of financial management capacities. Measures to mitigate the risk are in the financial \nmanagement  assessment.33 The  overall  project  procurement  risk  is  moderate.  The  project \nimplementation unit does not have experience in procurement for foreign-funded projects, and \nthere are differences between the procurement practices of ADB and the ZMG.34 Measures to \nmitigate the risks are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  ZMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 31). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n28.  The project is classified as a general intervention for poverty reduction. It will contribute to \nsocioeconomic development and poverty reduction by increasing access to (i) jobs during project \nconstruction and operation; (ii) new jobs in the service and light industries; (iii) skills training based \non an updated TVET curriculum; and (iv) a better living environment. The project will directly \nbenefit 270,000 residents of the seven project towns in Yanjiang District, including 1,618 urban \nand 5,547 rural poor people. The district\u2019s remaining 840,000 residents will indirectly benefit. The \nZMG prepared a social development action plan based on a poverty and social analysis that \nincluded stakeholder consultations. The plan outlines further participation during implementation. \n                                                \n32 The economic internal rates of return were not calculated for output 1 because its benefits are not quantifiable. \n33 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n29.  The project\u2019s gender category is effective gender mainstreaming. It will contribute to \ngender equality and inclusion by increasing women\u2019s access to jobs during construction and \noperation, particularly of ecological systems and environmental infrastructure. Attracting the best \nmale and female talent will be critical to transforming Ziyang into a hub of innovation in high-\ntechnology and green industries. The project will seek to create an enabling environment for \nprofessional women to seek jobs or business opportunities in the SZHTDZ, including assessing \noptions  to  enhance  women\u2019s  employment  and  job  retention,  job  progression,  and  career \ndevelopment.  The  project  will  support  information  campaigns  to  promote  female  students\u2019 \nenrollment in technical fields in the Sichuan Ziyang TVET center. The executing and implementing \nagencies will ensure gender action plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),36 the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:37 \n31.  Environment (category A). The ZMG prepared an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP), in line with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The EIA and EMP are based on the approved domestic feasibility study reports \nand  environmental  assessments,  site  visits,  and  stakeholder  consultations.  Consultations \nincluded affected people and local government agencies, and the outcomes were integrated in \nthe project design. The draft EIA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2018. The ZMG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for compliance with the EMP. \n32.  The project is expected to significantly contribute to municipal targets for environmental \nimprovement, e.g., (i) improved water quality of the Tuo River and avoided flood damage thanks \nto efficient stormwater collection and the capture of point and nonpoint source pollution; and \n(ii) improved groundwater protection, as well as greater health and safety of residents thanks to \nthe remediation of a landfill site. Construction and/or operational risks include the potential release \nof contaminants from polluted sediments during dredging or disposal, and leachate or gas \nemissions from the landfill site after remediation. Mitigation measures include the procedures for \nlandfill management, and the safe collection and disposal of the dredged sediments. The project \nis expected to be an important demonstration project on how medium-sized cities can help in \nenvironmental rehabilitation and transformation. Hence, with effective EMP implementation and \nprescribed training, the result will be residual impacts within the limits of the PRC\u2019s standards as \ndefined in the EMP. \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will occupy 4,265.06 mu of land\u2014\n1,183.8 mu of existing state-owned land, 1,540.98 mu of collective land to be acquired, and \n1,540.28 mu of collective land through the land use rights transfer (LURT).38 Residential houses \non 39,610 square meters and non-residential structures of 28 entities (31,030 square meters) will \nbe demolished. In total, 1,482 households and entities with 4,737 persons will be affected. The \nZMG prepared a resettlement plan in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and with laws and \nregulations  of  the  PRC  and  local  governments.  The  resettlement  plan  contains  adequate \nmeasures of compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation for affected people. It also includes \nthe due diligence report for past land acquisition and the LURT framework for future LURT \ncontracts. The ZMG held consultations with affected people and village committees, who will also \nbe  consulted  during  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  is  included  in  the \n                                                \n36 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf. \n37 ADB.

The executing and implementing agencies have experience in resettlement; \nthey will carry out the internal monitoring, engage an external monitoring agency, and have \ncommitted to implement and monitor the resettlement plan by allocating adequate budget and \nhuman  resources.  These  agencies  have  the  capacity  for  managing  resettlement  under \ndomestically financed projects. To implement this project\u2019s resettlement plan, their capacity will \nbe strengthened through consulting services and training. \n34.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category C). The project does not involve \nimpacts on ethnic minority villages or communities that would trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  requirements  on  indigenous  peoples.  A  scattered  population  of  ethnic  minority \nindividuals in the project area is not expected to suffer adverse impacts from the project. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n35.  The risk assessment of the overall project is medium, and the benefits and impact are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. The risks, which are rated either medium or low, and the \nmitigation measures are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote \n35). \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  The government and the ZMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the ZMG have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Sichuan  Ziyang  Inclusive  Green \nDevelopment Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n19 November 2018\n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nSustainable economic growth and  environmental improvement in the  Yangtze River  Economic  Belt \nachieved (Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030)a \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Reporting \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2025:     \nEconomic and  a.
