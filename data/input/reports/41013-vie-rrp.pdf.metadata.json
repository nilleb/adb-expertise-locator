The \nProject \nis  classified  under  environmental  category  B  and \nresettlement category A. \n \nThe Project seeks to enable an intermediary state of development \nfor Thanh Hoa and support its socioeconomic enhancement. It is \na  comprehensive  and  multisectoral  project  that  will  target  priority \ninvestments  and  create  a  suitable  and  sustainable  urban \nenvironment  for  Thanh  Hoa  and  strengthen  its  role  as  provincial \ncapital.  The  Project  will  upgrade  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  urban  core, \nintegrate  its  peri-urban  areas  and  further  develop  its  urban \ninfrastructure  and  key  economic  sectors.  The  expected  outputs \nwill  be:  (i)  an  improved  urban  road  network  (22  km)  and  urban \nbasic services to link peri-urban urban villages with the city center \nalong with complementary basic urban services; (ii) an expanded \nand  upgraded  water  supply  distribution  network,  including  about \n19  km  of  primary  and  secondary  water  supply  pipes  and \nconnections  to  expand  the  service  to  peri-urban  areas  and \nreplacement of 19 km of damaged pipes in the city; (iii) improved \ndrainage  and  wastewater  treatment  in  Thanh  Hoa  through  the \nconstruction of 47 km of interceptors for sewerage and drainage, \n13  pumping  stations,  a  central  wastewater  treatment  pond,  and \nthree  delocalized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  for  the  city \ngeneral hospital; (iv) improved human resources and skills within \nlocal  utilities  and  line  departments  of  Thanh  Hoa  and  THP  and \nimproved \nthe  upgrading  of \nvocational  training  centers  and  other  capacity  building  initiatives; \nand  (v)  a  well-managed \nthe \nconstruction of tourism facilities at tourist sites in Ham  Rong and \nMat Son.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  Socio- \nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. One of the key \nSEDP  objectives  is  to  support  sustained  urban  development,  in \nline  with  the  Orientation  Master  Plan  for  Urban  Development  to \n2020,  which  outlines  the  official  national  urban  policy.  This  plan \naims to establish population targets for cities and limit migration to \nHa Noi and Ho Chi Minh City through the promotion of sustainable \n\nlabor  skills,  achieved \n\ntourism  development \n\nthrough \n\nthrough \n\n\fdevelopment of secondary cities. \n\nThe  country  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nViet  Nam\u2019s  urban  sector  emphasizes  targeted  infrastructure \ninvestments  in  small-  and  medium-sized  towns  in  the  central \nregion  and  along  economic  corridors,  thereby  reducing  migration \nto the large metropolises. \n\nThanh  Hoa  was  selected  for  this  comprehensive  socioeconomic \ndevelopment initiative based on social and economic criteria such \nas  urban  population  growth,  urban  and  rural  poverty  levels, \neconomic development potential, and infrastructure needs. Thanh \nHoa is the capital and the only major urban center of Viet Nam's \nlargest,  second  poorest,  and  second  most  populous \nthird \nprovince.  Thanh  Hoa,  with  a  population  of  200,000,  represents \nonly  about  5%  of  THP's  3.7  million  people.  Currently  the \nprovince's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  half  the  national \naverage.  The  economy  is  weak  in  all  sectors,  especially  the \nindustrial  and  social  sectors,  which  rank  well  below  the  national \naverage according to various indexes. Thanh Hoa is challenged to \nmeet  the  ever-growing  demand  for  basic  urban  services  and \nreverse  the  large  outflow  of  migration  from  both  Thanh  Hoa  city \nand  province.  Thanh  Hoa  is  thus  a  prime  candidate  for  ADB \nassistance. \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe  Project  will  be \n\nThe  main \nthe  sustained \nsocioeconomic development of Thanh Hoa that will directly benefit \nabout 75,000 people in THP, and indirectly benefit about 270,000 \npeople in Thanh Hoa and its suburbs. The intended outcome is a \nwell-managed, livable, and competitive city. \n\n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $117.9  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $9.4 million. The total cost includes \nphysical  and  price \ninterest  during \nimplementation. \n\ncontingencies  and \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\nii \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAmounts \n\nItem  \nA.

Implementation will be \ndelegated  to  a  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU), \nheaded by a project director, and assisted by three fulltime deputy \nfinance  and  administration; \nproject  directors, \ntechnical  and  procurement  matters;  and  monitoring,  evaluation, \nand  safeguard  compliance.  Each  project  component  will  be \ndelegated  to  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  which  will  be \nintegrated  in  the  existing  management  structure.  The  Executing \nAgency  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC),  which \nwill  meet  at  least  four  times  a  year  to  assess  the  project \nimplementation status. Coordination at the community level will be \ncarried  out  through  the  Commune  Management  Council  (CMC). \nThe  CMC  will  deal  with  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan, \nthe IEE, the gender action plan, and resolution of related issues at \nthe community level. \n \nThanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee \n \n\nin  charge  of \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The civil works to be funded from the \nADB  loan  will  be  procured  through  (i)  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures for contracts exceeding $2.0 million, and \n(ii) national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures for contracts of \nless than $2.0 million. The equipment to be funded from the ADB \nloan  will  be  procured  through  (i)  ICB  procedures  for  contracts \nexceeding  $500,000;  (ii)  limited  international  bidding  procedures \nfor contracts between $100,000 and $500,000; and (iii) shopping \nprocedures for contracts of less than $100,000. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  procured  through  five  contracts. \nConsultants for the Project's urban road development component \n(component  1)  will  be  funded  from  the  Government  of  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  loan,  using  Government  of  the  Republic  of \nKorea  procurement  procedures.  The  second  contract  will  involve \nconsultants for components 2\u20135, which cover design, bidding, and \nconstruction supervision, will be funded from the ADB loan using \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure.  In  addition,  one \nnational  individual  consultant  will  be  recruited  independently  to \ncarry  out  resettlement  monitoring,  and  one  independent  auditing \nfirm will be recruited using the simplified technical proposal, under \ntwo  separate  contracts.  The  capacity  building  grant  will  be \nallocated to a firm selected using QCBS procedure and simplified \ntechnical  proposal  and  individual  consultants.  All  ADB-funded \nprocurement  for  consulting  services  will  be  made  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The technical proposals will be given \na weight of 80% and the financial proposals will be given a weight \nof 20%. \n \n\nThe  social  assessment  carried  out  under  a  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) project concluded that, although the \npoverty rate has been decreasing, Thanh Hoa will need to embark \non development that is more socially inclusive. Such development \nshould  target  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  poor  in  peri-urban \nareas and should be carried out in combination with investments \nin  citywide  infrastructure,  human  resource  development,  and \nimproved  urban  management.  The  social  assessment  also \nhighlighted  the  need  for  private  sector  investment  to  create  job \nopportunities,  which  in  turn  will  improve  living  standards  and \nalleviate  poverty.  By  2020,  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  about \n75,000  people  living  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  though \nimproved access roads and provision of urban basic services. By \n2020  the  Project  will  indirectly  benefit  the  200,000  people  of \nThanh  Hoa  as  well  as  an  additional  estimated  70,000  people  in \noutlying areas and townships. It is also expected that the project \nwill  indirectly  benefit  THP  by  reversing  the  out-migration  process \nand  provide  the  necessary  base  investment  for  Thanh  Hoa  to \ndevelop as a provincial capital. \n\n \n\n\fEach  component  shows  a  satisfactory  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR);  the  overall  EIRR  for  the  Project  has  not  been \ncalculated because different methodologies are used for revenue-\ngenerating  and  nonrevenue  generating  components.  However, \nthe  Project  is  viable  as  a  whole.  The  urban  road  development \ncomponent  is  economically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  17.2%.  The \nanalysis found an EIRR of 14.9% for the water supply component \nand  19%  for  the  tourism  component.  The  drainage  component \nhas  been  analyzed  using  the  least  cost  method  and  the  human \nresources  development  component  is  highly  justified.  Sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic \nviability. \n\nInvesting \n\nA  financial  analysis  was  performed  on  the  water  supply  and \ndrainage  components. \nthese  components  will \ncontribute  to  improving  the  networks  and  expanding  the  service \narea  to  peri-urban  villages  (about  75,000  inhabitants).  For  water \nsupply,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  over  the  project  life  is \nestimated at 15.3% while for drainage it is 4.2%; both are higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.5%. \n\nin \n\nOne  of  the  key  features  of  the  Project  is  the  institutional  reform \nagenda  and  capacity  building  proposed  for  the  water  and \nwastewater  companies.  New  legislation  enacted  in  2007  by  the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  requires  water  and  wastewater \ncompanies  to  undergo  reforms,  such  as  incorporation  as  joint-\nstock companies, undergoing equitization (partial privatization) by \n2010,  and  implementation  of  full  cost  recovery  for  water  supply \ncompanies  and  partial  cost  recovery  for  wastewater  companies. \nThis program will be funded through a grant from ADB's managed \nwater financing partnership facility. \n\nSeveral  risks  face  the  Project,  including  the  potential  lack  of \ncommitment from the Project\u2019s beneficiaries (resulting from a lack \nof  ownership),  currency  fluctuations  and  other  macroeconomic \nchanges, and unanticipated external economic events. \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  success  is  based  on  the  following  assumptions:\n(i)  the  Government,  ADB,  and  key  stakeholders  ensure  that \nqualified  consultants  and  personnel  are  recruited  for  the  Project, \nand that disbursements of counterpart and other funds are made \nin  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  commitment  of  people's  committees  to \nundertake  policy  and  institutional  reforms;  (iii)  implementation  of \nsuggested  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  tariff  adjustments;\n(iv) active participation and sense of ownership from stakeholders \nand project beneficiaries; (v) stakeholder and beneficiary support \nfor  the  Project;  and  (vi)  implementation  of  environmental,  social, \nand resettlement requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  from  the  Multidonor  Trust  Fund  for  the  Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant from the Netherlands \nTrust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nthe  Thanh  Hoa  City  Comprehensive  Socioeconomic  Development  Project.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nOver  the  last  two  decades  Viet  Nam  has  made  the  transition  from  centrally  planned  to \nmarket-oriented  economy  with  unprecedented  success.  From  1993  to  2006,  poverty 1  was \nreduced from 58.1% to 22.0%, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased from $288 to \n$722 in real terms, and economic output rose by an average of 7.5% annually. Between 2001 \nand  2006,  domestic  and  international  trade  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  17%,  while \nforeign direct investment increased by 650%. The Government recognizes the private sector\u2019s \npivotal  role  in  the  economy,  since  the  private  sector  generated  almost  90%  of  the  7.5  million \njobs created during the same period. \n\n3. \nThe  rapid  urbanization  of  Viet  Nam  is  a  reflection  of  the  country's  economic \ndevelopment. The urban growth rate has averaged 4.9% per annum over the last decade; about \n20  million  (23%)  of  the  current  population  of  85  million  now  live  in  urban  areas.  By  2020,  the \nurban component of the population is expected to nearly double to 40% as the population swells \nto  a  projected  104  million.  The  most  rapid  changes  are  occurring  in  the  two  largest  and  most \ndynamic cities\u2014Ho Chi Minh City (5.2 million people) and Ha Noi (3.4 million people). The next \ntiers of secondary cities have achieved much slower growth rates. As a result, these major cities \nare becoming more congested due to in-migration and are facing increasingly serious social and \nenvironmental problems, such as chaotic spatial development and land speculation. Meanwhile, \nsecondary  cities  that  are  located  beyond  the  political  and  economic  sphere  of  the  large  cities \nare  stagnating.  If  the  neglect  of  secondary  city  development  continues,  the  spatial  and \neconomic  disparities  will  further  constrain  not  only  urban  development,  but  also  the  economic \ndevelopment of Viet Nam as a whole. \n\n4. \nThe  Government,  through  its  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP  2006\u20132010), \nplans  to  develop  urban  areas  as  growth  centers  and  modernize  urban  infrastructure  to  attract \ninvestment,  improve  living  standards,  reduce  urban-rural  disparities,  and  ensure  sustainable \ndevelopment. Another plan, the Orientation Plan for Urban Development to 2020, also aims to \npromote  the  development  of  small-  and  medium-sized  cities  and  reduce  gaps  between  urban \nand rural areas. Similarly, separate orientation plans for water supply, urban drainage, and solid \nwaste management and industrial waste aim to upgrade and expand, by 2020, a water supply \nsystem  to  ensure  100%  coverage;  drainage  and  sewerage  systems  to  ensure  80%  coverage; \non-site  treatment  for  toxic  waste  for  enterprises;  and  collection  systems  for  solid  and  liquid \nwastes that can collect and dispose of at least 95% of urban and industrial wastes. \n\n5. \nIn  parallel,  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  urban  sector  emphasizes  targeted \ninfrastructure  investments  in  small-  and  medium-sized  towns  in  the  central  region  and  along \neconomic corridors, with the objective of reducing migration to the large metropolitan cities. This \nwill  require large  investments  in  infrastructure; decentralized  and  improved  urban  governance; \n                                                 \n1  Poverty is based on the data obtained from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. 2005. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nadequate  cost  recovery  of  urban  services;  improved  human  resource  capacity;  promotion  of \nbroad-based  participation  from  the  private  sector  and  community  groups;  and  inclusive \ndevelopment measures that take into account vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. \n\n6. \nThe  main  challenges  facing  secondary  cities  arise  from  a  lack  of  urban  infrastructure \ninvestments and the limited ability of local governments to provide reliable and affordable urban \nservices. Missing links in the road network, obsolete water supply pipes and high water losses, \nflooding and clogged drains, and disposal of untreated waste constrain the productive capacity \nof secondary cities and make these cities less competitive and livable. The lack of infrastructure \nand limited capacity to manage urban services further discourages external investments that are \ncritical to economic development and growth. To date, the Government has targeted 11 class II \nsecondary  cities2 that  have  been  promoted  as  target  cities  for  development  to  limit  growth  in \nHanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  ADB  is,  therefore,  targeting  its  assistance  at  this  class  II  group. \nAssistance  will  include  investments  to  upgrade  and  expand  urban  infrastructure,  and  \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments  in  capacity  building,  institutional  reform,  and  participatory  development.  ADB  will \ncollaborate with development partners and the private sector. \n\nThanh  Hoa  City  (Thanh  Hoa),  the  capital  of  Thanh  Hoa  Province  (THP),  has  been \n7. \nselected for ADB assistance based on several criteria: (i) urban population growth\u2014the city has \na population of 200,000 and aims to become a class I3 city by 2015 through natural population \nincrease,  in-migration,  and  the  expansion  of  the  city  boundary  to  150  km2;  (ii)  high  poverty \nlevels\u2014the city and the province have relatively high poverty levels;4 (iii) economic development \npotential\u2014the city has high industrial development and tourism potential because of its wealth \nof  natural  resources  and  strong  cultural  heritage;  (iv)  infrastructure  needs\u2014the  city  requires \nmassive  infrastructure  investments  in  order  to  fully  benefit  from  the  major  changes  that  will \noccur  over  the  next  15  years  in  the  region;5 and  (v)  special  features  that  could  potentially  be \ndeveloped  (e.g.,  tourism,  cultural  heritage,  sustainable  industrial  development,  environmental \nfeatures).  If  the  Project  is  successful,  it  can  serve  as  a  model  for  future  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic  urban  development  projects  that  involves  simultaneous  investments  in  various \nsectors. An urban sector analysis of Thanh Hoa is in Appendix 2. A detailed project context and \ndescription is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n8. \nThanh  Hoa\u2019s  boundless  potential  is  not  matched  by  the  quantity  and  productivity  of  its \nlabor  force.  Although  there  is  near-universal  enrollment  in  secondary  education,  tertiary \neducation enrollment remains low and the level of vocational training is not commensurate with \n\n                                                 \n2  Cities  with  a  population  of  over  250,000,  with  the  following  administrative  responsibilities:  preparing  their \nsocioeconomic  and  physical  plans,  preparing  the  local  budget,  allocating  and  leasing  land  to  households  and \nindividuals,  issuing  land-use  certificates,  managing  handicraft  villages,  regulating  local  construction,  managing \ninternal road networks and social infrastructure, and approving investment projects using the state capital budget \nallocated  by the provincial authorities. The class II secondary cities are  Bien Hoa, Buon Ma Thuot, Can Tho, Ha \nLong, Hoa Binh, Nam Dinh, Nha Trang, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Vinh, and Vung Tau. \n\n3  Class  I  cities  have  populations  of  more  than  500,000  and  the  following  added  administrative  responsibilities: \nplanning and managing infrastructure investment; preparing and managing the implementation of land-use plans; \nmanaging small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; overseeing the construction and operationalization of \nindustrial  or  processing  zones;  planning  and  managing  infrastructure  development  (local  transport  system, \nhighways, water supply, drainage, and sewerage systems); managing high schools, vocational schools, clinics, and \nheritage  sites;  approving  state  investment  projects;  licensing  foreign  investment  projects;  allocating  and  leasing \nlands  to  organizations  and  foreigners;  registering  non-state  enterprises;  and  approving  and  managing  housing \ndevelopment and state-owned stocks. The class I cities are Hai Phong, Da Nang, and Hue. \n\n4  Thanh Hoa is the second poorest province with a GDP per capita of half of the country\u2019s GDP per capita of $622. \nDespite  the  country\u2019s  7.5%  economic  growth  and  trade  performance  (600%  growth  from  1995\u20132005),  the \nunemployment and poverty levels are well above the national average. \n\n5  This  include,  among  others,  the  construction  of  the  new  north-south  expressway;  development  of  Road  217,  a \nsegment of the international road connecting Thanh Hoa with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; and coastal \nRoad 10 to Hai Phong, northern Viet Nam\u2019s major port. \n\n\fthe  demands  and  the  needs  of  the  manufacturing  and  tourism  industries,  which  are  potential \ndrivers  of  economic  growth.  These  factors,  along  with  a  poor  regulatory  framework,  constrain \npotential outside investment. \n\n9. \nDespite having recently completed its city master plan, Thanh Hoa has no indication of \nhow the master plan will be implemented, where funding sources and implementation for capital \nexpenditures,  and  operation  and  maintenance  will  be  sought,  or  which  agency  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the master plan. There is an urgent need for Thanh Hoa to launch \na preliminary development plan as the prelude to its overall socioeconomic development plan, \nwhich  will  require  massive  external  investments.  Any  development  intervention  should, \ntherefore,  be  comprehensive  and  multisectoral,  and  should  target  priority  sectors  to  create  a \nsuitable and sustainable urban environment for Thanh Hoa in its role as a provincial capital and \nregional hub of north-central Viet Nam. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nThanh Hoa aims to become a regional hub and service center for new investments in the \nprovince, with the goal of achieving class I status by 2015. To achieve these goals, Thanh Hoa \nneeds  to  capitalize  on  its  strengths,  overcome  its  weaknesses,  and  minimize  threats  to  its \ndevelopment.  During  project  preparation,  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) \nconsultant  indicated  that  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  key  competitive  advantages  are  its  location  along  main \ntransportation  routes,  its  capacity  to  expand  spatially,  and  its  proximity  to  economically \ndeveloping areas such as Bim Son, Nghi Son, and Sam Son, natural resources (for mining), and \nnatural landscapes (for tourism). Thanh Hoa\u2019s best development opportunities lie in the areas of \ntourism  (cultural  heritage  and  natural  resources)  and  industry.  Its  weaknesses  are  poor  urban \ninfrastructure,  unfavorable  demographic  and  labor  conditions  (out-migration,  low  productivity, \nlow  skills,  and  skills  mismatch),  and  weak  human  resource  capacity.  The  main  threat  is \ncompetition  from  fellow  provincial  capitals  Ninh  Binh  and  Vinh  for  the  status  of  North  Central \nViet Nam's main regional hub. These cities, which are the capitals of Thanh Hoa\u2019s neighboring \nprovinces Ninh Binh and Nghe An, could potentially replace Thanh Hoa as the primary service \ncenter for THP. \n\n11. \nSpatial  Location  and  Linkages.  Lying  150  km  south  of  Ha  Noi,  Thanh  Hoa  is \naccessible to Ha Noi, yet far enough away to ensure its own local economic development. It is \nlocated  along  major  transportation  networks  and  is  within  easy  reach  of  the  industrial \ndevelopment town of Bim Son (15 km to the north), the tourist town of Sam Son (16 km to the \neast), and the special industrial zone of Nghi Son (60 km to the south). The city center needs \nupgrading, particularly the central business area where the National Highway A1 intersects Le \nLoi Avenue. The construction of a new bridge crossing the Ma River is another pressing need. \nThe  outlying  peri-urban  areas  have  economic  potential,  yet  are  not  well-utilized  because  they \nare poorly linked to the city center. For example, urban villages in the southwest of Thanh Hoa \nare  engaged  in  stone  processing,  handicraft  making,  and  bronze-drum  making.  Tourism  sites \n(Ham Rong and Mat Son), small and medium-sized enterprises, and historic sites (such as the \n2,500-year-old Dong Son archaeological site) are scattered and are not spatially integrated with \nthe  urban  core.  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  future  development  needs  to  progressively  reach  these  urban \nvillages, toward the east and south to expand over about 150 km2, with a future population of \n500,000.  \n\n12. \nKey  Economic  Sectors:  Industrial  Development  and  Tourism.  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  main \nareas  of  potential  economic  development  are  industry  and  tourism.  In  addition  to  the  existing \nindustrial  zones  of  Le  Mon,  Tay  Bac  Ga,  and  Dinh  Huong,  which  are  located  within  the  city \nboundaries, the main industries are extractive mining (stone, marble, kaolin, cement) and basic \nprocessing  industries  (especially  seafood).  These  industries  have  absorbed  some  of  the  local \n\n33 \n\n \n\n\flabor. However, graduates of local vocational schools are not well-equipped to respond to the \ndemands of these industries. New industrial zones have been planned in Hoang Hoa district to \nthe north and Quang Xuong district in the south to further capitalize on the availability of natural \nresources.  The  tourism  sites  of  Ham  Rong  (ecotourism  and  limestone  scenery),  Dong  Son \n(archaeology), and Mat Son (handicraft and stone villages) suffer from poor access and limited \nor  no  tourism  amenities.  These  sites  are  largely  untouched,  although  private  companies  have \nexpressed interest in developing them. In addition, Sam Son, a tourist resort town 16 km east of \nThanh  Hoa,  and  Hoang  Hoa  beach  to  the  north  are  within  close  reach  of  Ha  Noi,  but  receive \ntourists only during 3 months of the year. THP and Thanh Hoa have not been able to develop \nsynergies to capitalize on the potential of these sites because of the interrelated issues of major \ninfrastructure gaps, limited human resource capacity, and a poor regulatory framework. \n \nUrban  Infrastructure  Conditions.  Despite  recent  investments,  the  existing  urban \n13. \ninfrastructure  is  obsolete  and  deteriorating,  particularly  urban  roads,  water  supply,  solid  waste \nand drainage, and wastewater treatment. \n\nRoads.  The  main  thoroughfares  of  Le  Loi  Avenue  and  National  Road  1A  and  their \n14. \nsurrounding  arteries  have  just  been  upgraded  and  are  in  good  condition.  However,  most \nsecondary and tertiary roads leading from the city center to peri-urban areas have deteriorated \nand are subject to floods. Travel time to the city center can take one hour or more. There are \ncurrently 84 km of roads in Thanh Hoa. Urgent priorities for Thanh Hoa include the completion \nof  a  ring  road  around Thanh  Hoa  to  divert  traffic  from  overused  National  Road  1A  and  Le  Loi \nAvenue;  completion  of  various  missing  links  in  the  road  network  including  links  to  secondary \nroads  and  links  to  access  roads  to  handicraft  villages  and  tourism  sites;  and  ensuring  proper \noperation and maintenance of the road surface.  \n\n15.  Water  Supply.  Piped  water  supply  coverage  is  about  60%,  while  the  remaining \npopulation  uses  shallow  wells;  nonrevenue  water  is  about  36%.  Thanh  Hoa  has  a  24-hour \nuninterrupted  water  supply  and  daily  consumption  is  90  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lcd)  in  the \nurban area and 70 lcd in peri-urban areas. The average daily water demand is about 45,000 m3 \nper day while current production is 30,000 m3 per day, serving Thanh Hoa, Sam Son, and five \nother  townships.  By  improving  the  piped  water  network  (replacing  pipes,  repairing  leaks, \nreducing nonrevenue water), as well as the management efficiencies of the Thanh Hoa Water \nSupply  Company  (THWSC),  more  Thanh  Hoa  residents  will  be  able  to  access  reliable  piped \nwater. \n\n16. \nDrainage  and  Sewerage.  Drainage  is  problematic  as  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  topography  is  flat \nand  up  to  one-third  of  the  city  is  flooded  during  the  rainy  season.  The  partially  completed \ndrainage  system  cannot  prevent  frequent  flash  floods.  There  is  no  wastewater  treatment  in \nThanh Hoa. The absence of an adequate wastewater collection system leads people to dispose \nwastewater  directly  into  canals  and  waterways,  creating  pollution  and  public  health  hazards. \nThere  is  a  need  to  upgrade  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  drainage  system  as  well  as  treat  the  wastewater \nbefore  disposal.  The  Project  will  improve  the  management  of  the  Urban  Environmental \nCompany (URENCO). \n\n17. \nOut-Migration  from  Thanh  Hoa  Province  and  City.  The  current  demographic  trend \nindicates  a  shift  in  population  growth  and  significant  out-migration,  both  for  THP  and  Thanh \nHoa. THP is one of the most densely populated provinces in Viet Nam. It is expected that within \nthe next 10 years there could be a labor surplus of 700,000 based on an annual growth rate of \n3.2%. On the other hand, Thanh Hoa, with a population of 200,000, has a growth rate of 1.9% \nper  year,  but  still  could  lose  over  70,000  people  to  migration.  If  this  trend  continues,  out-\nmigration  from  THP  will  increase,  but  not  necessarily  to  Thanh  Hoa. Training  the  workforce in \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fthe  right  mix  of  skills  based  on  the  demands  of  key  economic  sectors  will,  therefore,  be  a \nchallenge to retaining a productive workforce. \n\n18. \nA Low-Skilled Workforce and Capacity to Provide Urban Services. Currently, private \ninvestors are not investing in Thanh Hoa because of major infrastructure gaps and poor human \nresource  capacity.  Although  Thanh Hoa  has  a near  universal  secondary-level  graduation  rate, \nonly  18%  of  the  population  has  received  any  tertiary  education  or  professional  training.  There \nare  6,000  students  in  THP,  distributed  over  15  continuing  education  centers,  20  vocational \ntraining institutions, and one university, Hong Duc. However, there is a gap between the skills \nsupplied  and  those  required,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  general  administration,  language, \ncommunications,  and  management  skills  to  promote  tourism  and  industrial  development.  In \norder  to  improve  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  competitiveness  and  reduce  migration  out  of  THP  and  Thanh \nHoa, the skills of the labor force must be improved through targeted investments  in education \nand training.  \n\n19. \nInstitutional  Aspects  of  Urban  Infrastructure  Management  and  Provision.  The \ncauses  of  inefficient  infrastructure  are  multifaceted  but  are  rooted  in  the  lack  of  a  regulatory \nframework for infrastructure service provision. These include: (i) inadequate financing and cost \nrecovery  mechanisms  for  capital  and  operating  expenditures;  (ii)  existence  of  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  structural  bottlenecks  that  deter  private  investment  to  finance  urban \ninfrastructure; (iii) limited human resource capacity to plan, operate, and manage urban assets \nand provide urban services; and (iv) a lack of capacity to regulate the provision of infrastructure \nservices.  The  need  for  improved  capacity  will  not  only  be  addressed  within  THWSC  and \nURENCO, but also in line departments within the Thanh Hoa and THP people's committees. \n\nSupport  for  Urban  Development.  Official  development  assistance  (ODA)  has  been \n20. \nimportant  to  developing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  urban  infrastructure.  About  $1.3  billion  of  ODA  has  been \ninvested in the country\u2019s urban sector since 1995; ADB has provided $427 million of that total. \nHowever,  most  of  these  investments  have  been  directed  to  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and \ntheir  metropolitan  regions.  In  order  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  developing \nsecondary cities, a more distributional allocation of investments must be made. Both THP and \nThanh  Hoa  are  managing  ODA  projects  (about  $200  million)  in  key  investment  areas  of \ninfrastructure, tourism, industrial development, and human resource development, such as the \nfuture industrial development of Nghi Son, the merging of Thanh Hoa and Sam Son, the tourism \ndevelopment of Hoang Hoa, the rehabilitation of Road 217 from Thanh Hoa to the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  and  the  proposed  expressway  from  Ninh  Binh  to  Thanh  Hoa  and  Vinh. \nThese  have  gradually  built  capacity  for  project  management.  Appendix  3  provides  a  list  of \nexternal assistance to Viet Nam in the urban sector. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  will  be  the  sustained  socioeconomic  development  of  Thanh  Hoa \nthat  will  directly  benefit  about  75,000  people  in  THP,  and  will  indirectly  benefit  about  270,000 \npeople  in  Thanh  Hoa  and  its  suburbs.  The  intended  outcome  is  a  well-managed,  livable,  and \ncompetitive city by 2015. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n22. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  comprise  three  main  interrelated  investments:  (i)  core  urban \nenvironment  upgrading;  (ii)  integrated  peri-urban  development;  and  (iii)  investments  in  key \neconomic  sectors,  such  as  industry  and  tourism.  Core  urban  environment  upgrading \ninvestments  will  be  targeted  to  solve  the  most  pressing  environmental  problems  and  provide \n\n55 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nurban  services  to  the  urban  center.  At  present  water  supply,  drainage,  and  wastewater \ncollection services in the urban center are inadequate, which is creating severe problems for the \nurban  environment  and  public  health  despite  previous  investment  projects  to  address  these \nissues.6 The integrated peri-urban development component aims to boost the local economy by \nimproving  links  between  the  city  center  and  peri-urban  areas  and  sites  such  as  handicraft \nvillages,  other  tourist  areas,  and  training  facilities.  The  construction  of  arterial  and  secondary \nroads  to  the  peri-urban  areas  will  be  complemented  by  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services \nsuch  as  water  supply,  drainage,  and  street  lighting.  Investments  in  human  resources  and \ntourism  will  improve  the  environment  for  private  sector  participation,  create  jobs,  and  improve \nskilled labor. \n\n23. \n\nThe expected outputs will be as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImproved  urban  road  network  and  basic  urban  services.  The  Project  will \nimprove the urban road network and associated basic urban services through the \nconstruction of four bridges and 22 km of new and upgraded roads (comprising a \nnew 11 km ring road that relieves congestion in the city center and connects the \neast, south, and west parts of the city; and 11 km of secondary and access roads \nthat  will  link  isolated  peri-urban  villages  with  the  city  center).  In  addition,  box \nbeam  bridges  will  be  constructed  to  span  the  Le  river.  The  road  network  will \ncontribute to the improvement of Thanh Hoa\u2019s tourism infrastructure by improving \ntransport links between tourist attractions and the city center. The road network \nwill also enable the city\u2019s planned expansion. The ring road will be provided with \nrelated complementary basic urban services such as water supply and drainage \n(which  will  be  covered  under  [ii]  and  [iii]),  as  well  as  infrastructure  to  receive \npower and telecommunications grids. The upgraded secondary roads will also be \nprovided  with  water  pipes,  sewerage  and  drainage  channels,  culverts,  and \nstreetlights. The water supply pipes will be financed under (ii) and (iii). Given the \nimpacts that the road development component will have on poor households and \nwomen,  community  consultations  on  road  construction  will  be  given  top  priority \nand will be conducted at times conducive to women\u2019s participation. Bidding terms \nfor  contractors  will  require  engagement  of  both  males  and  females.7 In  order  to \nreduce the risks of increased and disorderly traffic resulting from improved roads, \na public awareness program on the importance of traffic safety will be developed. \n\nExpanded and upgraded water supply distribution network. The Project will \nexpand  the  water  supply  distribution  network  by  (a)  constructing  18.6  km  of \nprimary  and  secondary  water  pipes  to  expand  service  to  peri-urban  areas,  and \n(b) replacing 18.7 km of damaged primary and secondary pipes in the city center. \nAs per Decree 117/2007, THP has the authority to set water tariffs on a full cost \nrecovery  basis  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  The  Project  will  support \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  institutional  and  policy  reform  agenda  and  action  plan, \nfunded  in  parallel  to  the  Project  through  a  grant  from  the  Cities  Development \n\n                                                 \n6  An ongoing ADB-financed loan project (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Urban Environmental \nImprovement Project. Manila [Loan 2034-VIE, approved on 8 December]) has only been partially implemented and \nseveral  components  were  cancelled  due  to  major  increases  in  costs  since  approval;  only  the  secondary \nwastewater and drainage network  will be built under the loan. The proposed Project will, therefore, complete this \ninvestment by financing the primary drainage and tertiary sewerage network and the renovation of the water supply \nnetwork. \n\n7  This  will  include  provision  of  separate  toilet  facilities  for  men  and  women  workers,  a  daycare  facility  for  women \nworkers, and other measures. With regard to land acquisition consultations, both husband and wife will be required \nto sign acquisition agreements. \n\n\f(iii) \n\n77 \n\nInitiative in Asia (CDIA) and to be followed by a grant from the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility (WFPF), managed by ADB. The reform agenda and capacity \nbuilding  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to:  (a)  equitizing  (partly  privatizing) \nTHWSC;  (b)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  THWSC  to  improve  its  performance, \nprepare  affordability  guidelines,  improve  its  administration  and  management  as \nwell as develop specialized technical expertise such as the measures to recover \ncosts and reduce nonrevenue water; (c) undertaking a capacity building program \nfor  relevant  line  departments  of  THP  and  Thanh  Hoa  (management,  budget \nplanning,  and  asset  management),  as  clients  of  THWSC  and  to  facilitate  a \nconducive  business  climate  for  improved  water  supply  service  provision;  and \n(d)  improving  community  awareness  and  participation  in  the  management  and \nplanning of water supply services. \n\n(b)  strengthening \n\nImproved  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment.  The  Project  will  improve \ndrainage and wastewater treatment. Key subprojects will include the construction \nof about 20 km of interceptors for sewerage and drainage in peri-urban areas; the \nupgrading  of  27  km  of  interceptors  for  the  city  center;  the  construction  of  13 \npumping  stations;  the  construction  of  a  wastewater  treatment  pond  with  a \ncapacity of 15,000 m3 per day; and the construction of three smaller wastewater \ntreatment  facilities  for  the  city  general  hospital.  These  subprojects  will  reduce \nflooding in the city and drastically cut down on the amount of pollution discharged \ninto  the  Ma  River.  This  component  will  also  support  the  updating  and \nimplementation  of  a  detailed  institutional  and  policy  reform  agenda  and  action \nplan,  funded  in  parallel  to  the  Project  through  CDIA  and  WFPF.  The  reform \nagenda and capacity building will include, but not be limited to: (a) corporatizing \nURENCO; \nits \nperformance,  prepare  affordability  guidelines,  improve  its  administration  and \nmanagement,  and  maintain  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities; \n(c)  undertaking  capacity  building  program  for  relevant  line  departments  of  THP \nand  Thanh  Hoa  (management,  budget  planning,  and  asset  management)  as \nclients  of  URENCO  and  to  improve  the  overall  business  climate  for  improved \ndrainage  and  wastewater  service  provision;  and  (d)  improving  community \nawareness  and  participation  in  the  management  and  planning  of  drainage  and \nwastewater  services.  The  component  will  develop  a  community  awareness \nstrategy  on  household  sanitation  and  on  the  health  benefits  of  connecting \nhousehold  sewers  to  wastewater  treatment.8 It  will  also  develop  partnerships  to \nprovide low-cost solutions that will enable poor households to obtain piped water \nand  connect  to  sewer  systems.  With  improved  drainage  and  wastewater \ntreatment, it is expected that the incidence of waterborne diseases will decrease \nby about 50% by 2015. \n\nthe  capacity  of  URENCO \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n(iv) \n\nImproved  human  resources  and  skills.  The  Project  will  improve  labor \nproductivity  and  address  the  shortage  of  skilled  labor  in  areas  targeted  for \ndevelopment  such  as  tourism  and  industry.  This  will  be  achieved  in  part  by \nupgrading  six  existing  vocational  training  centers,  which  will  benefit  from \nupgraded  equipment  and  skills  training  for  teachers.  In  addition,  an  action  plan \nwill be launched to address skills shortages in key areas. To ensure that training \nis  relevant  to  the  needs  of  Thanh  Hoa  and  THP,  an  advisory  group\u2014including \n\n                                                 \n8  Activities  financed  in  parallel  to  the  Project  through  a  grant  from  the  ADB\u2019s  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility, \nwill be carried out by Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU), which highlights the benefits of sanitation improvements on \nwomen\u2019s and family health. \n\n \n\n\frepresentatives  of  the  private  sector;  industrial  zones;  vocational  schools;  the \nViet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU);  and  the  Department  of  Labor,  Invalids  and \nSocial Affairs (DOLISA)\u2014will be formed under the provincial project management \nunit  (PPMU)  to  provide  feedback  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  this \ncomponent. The Project will also support the establishment of a one-stop-shop in \nthe  center  of  Thanh  Hoa  that  will  provide  job  seekers  with  information  on \nvacancies  in  the  region,  information  on  availability  of  courses  to  enhance  their \nemployability,  and  CV  preparation  assistance.  The  center,  which  will  be  under \nDOLISA,  will  also  organize  annual  job  fairs.  With  such  investment  in  human \ndevelopment,  industrial  productivity  will  increase  by  about  25%  by  2015.  As  a \nresult, Thanh Hoa\u2019s employment and total economic output will also significantly \nincrease  by  2020.  The  PPMU  will  establish  baseline  data  on  participation  rates \nby  gender,  the  disabled,  and  ethnic  minority  group.  Student  enrollment  data \ndisaggregated by sex will be monitored during the life of the Project and included \nin  the  evaluation  framework.  The  design  briefs  for  new  school  buildings  will \ninclude  separate  male  and  female  toilet  facilities  and  access  for  people  with \ndisabilities. \n\n(v)  Well-managed  tourism  development.  The  Project  will  promote  ecotourism, \ncultural  heritage  tourism,  and  recreational  activities,  and  will  protect  the  natural \nenvironment  through  infrastructure  improvements,  restoration  projects,  facilities \ndevelopment,  and  service  improvements.  Specifically,  this  component  will  (a) \nimprove the infrastructure of the 2,000 m2 Thanh Hoa Museum; (b) upgrade the \nHam  Rong  ecotourism  area,  which  lies  to  the  north  of  Thanh  Hoa  and  features \nscenic limestone hills and cultural heritage sites (such as temples and pagodas); \naccess roads, a welcome center, and other tourism amenities will be built and/or \nupgraded,  and  a  60-hectare  (ha)  botanical  park  will  be  created;  (c)  restore  the \nworld-renowned  Dong  Son  archaeological  site,  which  contains  artifacts  dating \nback 2,500 years; both the site itself and the surrounding village will be restored; \nand  (d)  upgrade  Mat  Son,  a  collection  of  villages  specializing  in  stoneware, \nbronze, and various handicrafts, and beautify the nearby Le river. In addition to \nimproving  spatial  links  among  these  sites,  this  component  will  create  synergies \nbetween  tourism  and  handicraft  production,  urban  development,  industrial \ngrowth, and labor training. This component will also address the issue of tourism \nmanagement,  and  will  encourage  the  government  to  focus  on  regulatory \noversight and facilitation of private investments in tourism facilities. It is expected \nthat  by  2015  the  number  of  tourist  arrivals  to  Thanh  Hoa  will  increase  by  50%. \nThe  Project  will  also  support  that  small  businesses  oriented  toward  tourism, \navailable  credit  facilities,  and  training  opportunities  are  accessed  by  equal \nnumbers of women and men near project-targeted tourist sites. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n24. \nIntegrated Planning and Design. The Project seeks to integrate spatial and functional \nlinks,  which  will  comprise  targeted  investments  in  infrastructure  (urban  roads,  water  supply, \ndrainage, and wastewater treatment), human resource development, and institutional reform to \nenable Thanh Hoa to develop tourism and industry, as its key economic sectors. It will link three \nbroad  investments  comprising  core  urban  environment  upgrading,  integrated  peri-urban \ndevelopment,  and  investments  in  key  economic  sectors,  while  addressing  infrastructure  gaps \nand institutional bottlenecks. The proposed Project will finance an initial work program under the \nMaster Plan, building on existing infrastructure and competitive advantages to jumpstart Thanh \nHoa\u2019s  economic  development.  The  integration  of  various  project  components  will  result  in  an \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\foverall  benefit  greater  than  the  sum  of  the  benefits  derived  from  each  individual  component. \nThis integration will promote sustainable development in the project area and help achieve the \nproject  objective  of  transforming  Thanh  Hoa  into  a  competitive  and  livable  city.  The  Project's \nsecondary-city  development  model,  if  successful,  could  be  replicated  elsewhere  in  Viet  Nam \nand the Greater Mekong Subregion. The introduction of aesthetic urban design elements such \nas  sidewalks,  street  lighting,  benches,  and  other  street  furniture  that  reflect  its  rich  cultural \nheritages  are  essential  to  creating  an  \u201cimage\u201d  of  Thanh  Hoa,  which  has  a  huge  tourism \npotential. The City Development Strategy for Thanh Hoa in a Regional Context,9 a complementary \nstudy to be implemented by UN-Habitat and ADB, in parallel to the project will emphasize Thanh \nHoa's  role  within  the  regional  \"growth  triangle\"  that  includes  Xam  Neua  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic to the west, Vinh to the south, and Hanoi to the north. The study will define \nthe  roles  of  the  public  and  private  sectors,  as  well  as  civil  society  in  supporting  a  long-term \nvision  for  the  development  of  the  city.  It  will  also  identify  infrastructure  gaps  and  institutional \nbottlenecks that need to be overcome and review and update of the City Master Plan. \n\n25. \nCombined  Investments  to  Stimulate  City  Development.  The  Project  will  enable \nsimultaneous investments in Thanh Hoa\u2019s key economic sectors, not only by ADB but also by \nother  development  partners.  These  simultaneous  investments  will  move  the  local  economy \nforward  and  should  lead  to  additional  investments  down  the  road.  Cofinancing  is  sought  from \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea, through Korea Exim Bank, to finance the entire urban \nroad  development  component.  Parallel  to  the  Project,  four  grants  will  be  administered \nseparately, but are conceptually linked to enhance the Project\u2019s objectives: (i) the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction grant10 for small-scale infrastructure investments and services in the peri-\nurban  areas  of  the  city  specifically  targeting  the  urban  poor  and  promoting  community-based \norganizations;  (ii)  a  grant 11 from  the  Public  Private  Advisory  Facility,  which  will  finance  the \nestablishment  of  a  provincial  investment  fund  and  its  business  and  operation  plan  to  leverage \npublic  funding  with  private  sector  investment  in  the  form  of  public-private  partnerships  in \ninfrastructure; (iii) a Cities Development Initiative in Asia (CDIA) grant 12 that will prepare project \ncomponents in water supply and sanitation for Thanh Hoa and Sam Son, to be financed through \nthe newly established provincial investment fund; and (iv) a grant13 from  the WFPF, which will \nassist  in  the  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  THWSC  and  URENCO;  the \nProject  will  develop  an  action  plan  containing  the  proposed  phasing  of  activities,  timetable, \ninputs,  and  performance  indicators  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  THWSC  and  URENCO, \nexpand their coverage, and reduce their operating costs. In addition, capacity building programs \nwill  be  developed  for  the  line  departments  of  THP  and  Thanh  Hoa  that  are  engaged  in  the \nprovision of urban services. \n\nReform  for  Improved  Urban  Services.  The  low  capacity  of  utilities  companies  and \n26. \ngovernment  agencies  to  deliver  and  provide  affordable  and  sustainable  services  necessitates \nfurther  action  to  implement  existing  legislation  and  introduce  policy  reforms  to  restructure \nmanagement,  build  capacity,  improve  cash  flow,  and  remove  institutional  bottlenecks  that \nimpede  private  sector  participation.  A  major  thrust  of  the  reform  process  is  the  equitization  of \nTHWSC  and  the  corporatization  of  URENCO.  For  THWSC,  water  tariff  adjustments  will  be \n\n                                                 \n9  Draft  application  to  be  submitted  for  funding  through  the  Cities  Alliance,  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B,  due  for \n\napproval in 2009. \n\n10 ADB, 2008. Proposed Grant for Thanh Hoa Province Small-Scale Infrastructure Investments and Services in Urban \nand Peri-Urban Areas Project. Manila. The JFPR 9112-VIE was signed in July 2008 and will be implemented over \n4 years. \n\n11 Draft  application  to  Public  Private  Advisory  Facility  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C  for  implementation  in \n\n2008/2009 over 6 months \n\n12 Grant approval by CDIA is in Supplementary Appendix D for implementation in 2008/2009 over 6 months. \n13 An application to the WFPF has been approved on 14 January 2009 for implementation over 4 years from 2009. \n\n99 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nmade  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery  for  water  supply  as  required  under  existing  water  tariff \nlegislation;  for  URENCO,  the  objective  is  to  ensure  sufficient  revenue  to  cover  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  drainage  and  wastewater  management.  The  institutional  and \nreform agenda is in Appendix 4. \n\nDecentralized  Administration.  This  will  be  the  first  project  to  be  delegated  from  the \n27. \ncentral  Government  to  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee. 14 This  delegation  aims  to  improve \nproject  design  and  implementation  through  the decentralization  of  administration  and  approval \nprocesses.  This  will  also  bring  greater  project  ownership  to  provincial-  and  city-level \nstakeholders  and  improve  responsiveness  to  beneficiary  needs.  However,  there  is  also  an \ninherent  risk  that  the  technical  capacity  of  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  as  the  reviewing \nagency  will  be  limited.  Therefore,  monitoring  indicators  and  close  monitoring  by  ADB  during \nimplementation must be strengthened. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n28. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $117.9 million, including taxes and duties of \n$9.4  million.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other \ncharges during implementation. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n  \n\n  \n\n1.

The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% \n\n                                                 \n14 Based  on  Decree  131/2006/ND-CP  on  the  delegated  management  of  projects  financed  by  official  development \nassistance and Decision No. 48/2008/QD-TTg, using the new format for the feasibility study and investment report. \n\n\f1111 \n\nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and (ii) a grant of $2.0 million from the WFPF15 to \nfinance capacity building of THWSC and URENCO to provide affordable and sustainable water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services  to  the  residents  of  Thanh  Hoa  City.  The  ADB  financing \nrepresents  61%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  has  also  requested  a  loan  of  up  to \n$33.0  million  from  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  loan  will  have  a  35-year \nmaturity  with  a  10-year  grace  period  and  a  fixed  interest  rate  of  0%  for  the  tied  consulting \nservices  and  0.5%  for  the  untied  investment.  This  loan  would  finance  in  parallel  financing  to \nADB loan, the urban road development component (component 1) and consulting services for \ndetailed design, procurement support, and construction supervision of component 1. \n\n30. \nThe  remaining  cost,  about  $11.2  million  equivalent,  will  be  financed  by  the  Government. \nCounterpart  funds  will  cover  taxes  and  duties.  All  of  the  loans  to  the  Government  will  be  either \nrelent  or  on-granted  to  the  THP  People's  Committee,  according  to  Decree  QD  181  TTg.  For \nnonrevenue generating components (road development, drainage, human resource development, \nand  tourism),  the  mechanism  will  be  through  a  budgetary  transfer.  For  the  revenue  generating \ncomponent  (water  supply),  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  will  be  made  between  the  Government \n(i.e., the Ministry of Finance) and the borrowing entity (THWSC). A table of project cost estimates \nand  the  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  5.  A  detailed  project  cost  table  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E.

Implementation  will  be  delegated  to  a  PPMU,  which \nwill be established within 1 month of loan effectiveness, and will be headed by a project director \nand  assisted  by  three  deputy  project  directors,  one  in  charge  of  finance  and  administration, \nanother in charge of technical and procurement matters, and the third in charge of monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  safeguard  compliance.  The  PPMU  will  be  responsible  for  engaging  and \nsupervising the work of all consultants, and coordination of all aspects of the project works with \nthe central and local governments and development partners such as ADB and the Government \nof  the  Republic  of  Korea.  In  order  to  secure  timely  mobilization  of  the  consulting  services,  an \nindividual  consultant  financed  through  the  PPTA  is  already  finalizing  the  terms  of  reference, \nrequests for proposals, and bid evaluation reports for all consulting services (financed through \nboth  ADB  and  the  Republic  of  Korea).  Each  project  component  will  be  delegated  to  a  project \n\n                                                 \n15 The WFPF grant of $2.0 million will comprise $1.2 million from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund and $0.8 million from the \n\nNetherlands Trust Fund.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nimplementation unit (PIU), which will be integrated in existing management structures. Each PIU \nwill  be  responsible  for  managing  implementation  and  coordination  for  its  respective  project \ncomponent.  Liaison  and  coordination  with  the  community  will  be  done  through  the  Commune \nManagement  Council  (CMC).  The  CMC  will  deal  with  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement \nplan,  initial  environmental  examination,  gender  action  plan,  and  resolution  of  related  issues  at \nthe community level. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n32. \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be established by the Executing Agency and will \nmeet at least four times a year to assess the project implementation status. Membership to this \ncommittee  will  include  representatives  of  THP,  Thanh  Hoa,  ADB,  and  the  Government  of  the \nRepublic of Korea.  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  April  2009  to  June  2014.  The  above  period \n33. \nassumes  that  construction  work  on  the  first  package  will  commence  in  2010.  Six  months  is \nallowed  to  complete  all  construction  work  and  finalize  payments.  Timely  recruitment  of  the \nconsultants will be critical to keep the implementation schedule and commencing civil works by \n2010. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 6. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  contracts  procured  under  the  ADB  loan  with  international  competitive  bidding \n34. \nprocedures  and  for  consulting  services  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  by  ADB.  Documentation \nfor  the  first  contract  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  and  under  limited \ninternational  bidding  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  by  ADB;  thereafter,  post-review  will  be \nrequired unless otherwise agreed, as per the procurement plan. All procurement to be financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The civil works to be funded from the ADB loan will be procured \nthrough  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  for  contracts  exceeding \n$2.0  million, and (ii) NCB procedures for contract of less than $2.0 million. The equipment to be \nfunded from the ADB loan will be procured through (i) ICB procedures for contracts exceeding \n$500,000;  (ii)  limited  international  bidding  and  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  between \n$100,000  and  $500,000;  and  (iii)  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  of  less  than  $100,000.  At \nthe  request  of  the  Executing  Agency,  domestic  preference  for  contracts  bid  under  ICB \nprocedures will be applied. Procurement under the Government of the Republic of Korea loan \nwill  be  untied.  Using  the  engineering-procurement-construction  method,16 it  is  anticipated  that \nforce account will be employed when the small size and location of the works make competitive \nbidding  less  attractive.  Among  the  works  that  might  fall  into  this  category  are  village  access \nroads, minor irrigation and drainage works, and other small and remote scattered works. Force \naccount will also be used in other special cases where local contractors do not express interest \nin undertaking the works or where force account can be demonstrated to be the most efficient \nand effective method of implementation. A procurement plan is included in Appendix 7. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n35. \nThe consulting services to be funded under the Project will be undertaken through five \ncontracts.  The  urban  road  development  component  (component  1)  will  be  funded  from  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea loan. It will be funded on a tied basis and will be sourced \nfrom the Republic of Korea for the foreign portion and from Viet Nam for the local portion of the \nfinancing. The Korean and Vietnamese consultants will be selected according to the guidelines \nfor the employment of consultants under the Government of the Republic of Korea\u2019s Economic \n\n                                                 \n16 As defined as per Vietnamese Bidding Law No.61/2005/QH11.  \n\n \n\n\f1313 \n\nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund. 17  Consultancy  for  components  2\u20135,  which  cover  design, \nbidding, and construction supervision, will be funded from the ADB loan using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  (QCBS)  procedure.  The  ADB  loan  will  also  fund  the  engagement  of  one \nnational  consultant,  recruited  as  an \nindependently  carry  out \nresettlement  monitoring,  and  one  international  independent  auditing  firm  using  least-cost \nselection. The capacity building grant will be allocated to a firm selected using QCBS procedure \nand  simplified  technical  proposal  and  individual  consultants.  All  ADB-funded  procurement  for \nconsulting  services  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Under QCBS, the technical proposals will be \ngiven a weight of 80% and the financial proposals will be given a weight of 20%. An outline of \nthe consultants\u2019 terms of reference is in Appendix 8. \n\nindividual  consultant, \n\nto \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \nwith  the  THP  People\u2019s  Committee.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anti-Corruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n37. \nTo  ensure  transparency  and  good  governance,  the  PPMU  will  publicly  disclose  on  its \nwebsite  information  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used.  For  each  procurement  contract  the \nPPMU will disclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods \nand/or services purchased, and  (vi)  intended and actual utilization of loan proceeds  under each \ncontract.  The  PPMU  will  also  disclose  details  of  resettlement  reports  on  its  or  the  Executing \nAgency's website. The website will be updated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n38. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  contractors  and \nconsultants,  based  on  an  approved  contract  using  direct  payment  procedures.  Payments  for \nPPMU  incremental  administration  costs  will  be  made  from  an  imprest  account,  managed  and \nadministered by the PPMU, held at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. \nThe initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures, to be funded \nfrom  the  imprest  account,  for  the  first  6  months  of  the  project  implementation  or  $5  million, \nwhichever is lower. Five second-generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will be established in the \n(i)  four  PIUs  for  components  2\u20135  for  use  in  the  payment  of  expenses  arising  from \nimplementation by PIUs for their incremental costs and related expenses, and (ii) resettlement \ncommittee for use in the payment of land acquisition and resettlement costs.18 The initial deposit \nto an SGIA will be based on estimated expenditures, to be funded through the SGIA, for the first \n\n                                                 \n17 The  guidelines  require  advertisement  to  receive  expression  of  interest  and  a  short  list  of  three  to  five  consulting \n\nfirms. \n\n18 Since the ADB loan will finance land acquisition and resettlement costs, detailed arrangements will be made during \nthe  setting-up  of  the  PPMU  to  ensure  that  the  disbursement  of  funds  is  done  transparently,  efficiently,  and \neffectively to avoid the misuse of funds and to ensure that the funds will reach those from whom the land or right-\nof-way is purchased in full. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n6  months  of  project  implementation,  or  $0.5  million,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to \nthe imprest account to facilitate project implementation. The ceiling for each payment under the \nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  is  $100,000.  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nPPMU  will  be  required  to  submit  for  ADB  approval  all  of  the  proposed  staffing,  financial \nmanagement systems, and procedures for the imprest account and the five SGIAs. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe PPMU shall maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \n39. \nand  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  project  loan,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  an  audit  of  resettlement  expenditures,  and  use  of  local \nfunds. Within 6 months of the close of the year, the PPMU will submit an audited annual project \naccount to ADB that will provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade.19 The  annual  project  account  will  be  audited  by  an  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  the \nauditor\u2019s  terms  of  reference  will  be  approved  by  ADB  before  commencement  of  work.  The \nannual  audit  will  include  an  audit  opinion  on  the  imprest  account,  SGIAs,  and  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure operations. The audit results will be submitted to ADB annually. \n\n40. \nSemiannual  progress  reports  on  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  the  design  and \nconstruction supervision consultants, and reviewed by the PPMU for further submission to ADB \nwith  copy  to  the  Executing  Agency.  Progress  reports  will  include  a  description  of  the  physical \nprogress,  status  of  implementation  of  resettlement,  gender,  and  environmental  management \nplans,  as  well  as  the  status  of  procurement,  disbursements,  and  highlights  of  other \nimplementation  issues.  The  progress  reports  will  also  contain  a  summary  and  evaluation  of \nproject  accounts,  including  details  of  the  latest  project  expenditures,  contract  amounts,  and \nother uses of loan proceeds. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe PPMU will submit semiannual progress reports to ADB and conduct timely baseline \n41. \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  Data  on  the  relevant  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nreporting  purposes  will  be  collected,  analyzed,  and  compared  against  the  targets  achieved \nduring  project  completion.  Performance  indicators  will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  (i)  urban \ninfrastructure service coverage; (ii) road length and traffic conditions for roads; (iii) unaccounted-\nfor water, production capacity, O&M costs, and billing and collection efficiency for water supply; \n(iv) incidence and reduction of flooding, drainage, and wastewater treatment capacity; (v) tourist \narrivals  and  revenue  generated;  and  (vi)  labor  output  and  productivity.  Semiannual  progress \nreports  will  describe  physical  progress,  details  of  any  change  in  schedule,  implementation \nprogress  against  the  gender  action  plan,  updates  on  implementation  of  the  environmental, \nresettlement, and gender action plans, use of loan proceeds, and an outline of the work for the \nnext  6  months.  The  report  will  provide  summary  financial  accounts  of  the  Project,  including \nexpenditures during the period, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date. The \nPPMU will submit to ADB, within 3 months of physical project completion, a project completion \nreport  covering  the  details  of  implementation,  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  other \ninformation requested by ADB. A post-resettlement evaluation by an independent consultant will \nbe undertaken once all project resettlement activities have been completed. The indicators to be \nmonitored  will  be  formulated,  discussed,  and  agreed  upon  by  ADB,  the  THP  People's \nCommittee, and the Thanh Hoa People's Committee. \n\n                                                 \n19 A  separate  audit  opinion  is  to  be  issued  for  the  use  of  the  (i)  imprest  account  and  second  generation  imprest \n\naccounts, and (ii) SOE procedures. \n\n\f1515 \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n42. \nADB,  together  with  Government  representatives  and  the  cofinanciers,  will  undertake \nregular  reviews  of  the  Project  at  about  6-month  intervals.  At  critical  periods  during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  environmental  management  plans,  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  and  environment  specialists  will  join  the  reviews.  In  addition  to  these  regular \nreviews  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  will  be  carried  out.  This \nmidterm review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections, such as the consideration to \nuse loan savings and remaining contingencies. About 1 year after project completion, a project \ncompletion review will document the achievements of the Project. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\nA social impact assessment was carried out based on ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social and \n43. \nPoverty  Analysis  (2001)  to  assess  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  THP  and  Thanh  Hoa,  and  the \nsocial  dimensions  of  poverty;  identify  key  issues  and  potential  project  impacts  on  women,  the \npoor,  ethnic  minorities,  and  vulnerable  groups;  recommend  pro-poor  design  of  the  project \ncomponents;  and  suggest  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators.  The  assessment  highlighted \nthat the poverty rate20 in the urban wards was about 13.6%. In general, residents in peri-urban \nareas are poorer than residents in the urban core. The lack of infrastructure and basic services \nand  marginalization  (particularly  in  peri-urban  areas  with  lack  of  transportation  access  to  the \ncity) along with a lack of productivity, ill health, and low skills, were considered the main causes \nof poverty. It is expected that improved urban roads will provide greater access to residents in \nperi-urban areas and improve the flow of goods, services, and people. Safe and reliable piped \nwater  will  help  lower  water  costs,  save  time,  and  improve  health.  Better  drainage  and  solid \nwaste collection systems will help eliminate standing rain and storm water and cut down on the \nincidence of unsanitary solid and liquid wastes disposal. Tourism and business development will \nimprove the city\u2019s image and increase labor productivity, as well as attracting investments and \nrevenue.  Promotion  of  hygiene  awareness  will  complement  the  Project\u2019s  physical  investments \nand  provide  health  benefits  to  infants,  women,  and  the  elderly,  who  are  more  susceptible  to \nwaterborne disease and environment-related illness. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n2. \n\nGender Impact \n\n44. \nA  gender  assessment was  carried  out  to  analyze  the  situation  of  women  in  the project \narea,  their  participation  in  the  labor  market  (formal  or  informal),  their  access  to  basic  social \nservices,  the  constraints  on  women\u2019s  access  to  the  urban  labor  market,  and  the  potential  for \ngrowing  tourism,  small  and  medium-sized  business  development,  and  investment  in  industry \nand  trade  to  create  more  job  opportunities  for  women.  In  accordance  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Law  on \nGender Equality, effective July 2007, and the recent decree for the implementation of the Law on \nGender  Equality 21  project  interventions  will  contribute  to  promoting  gender  equality  and \nopportunities  for  women  by  mainstreaming  gender-responsive  strategies  across  all  sectors  of \nintervention. Capacity building to enable the stakeholder institutions to implement activities that \npromote  equal  opportunity  and  participation  for  women  and  men  will  be  provided  under  the \nproject  gender  analysis  and  action  plan.  The  gender  analysis  and  action  plan,  which  is \n\n                                                 \n20 Based on the definition of poverty set forth by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, 2005. \n21 N70/2008/ND, endorsed by the National Assembly on 4 June 2008.  \n\n \n\n\fincorporated in the social and gender analysis, is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities \n\n45. \nA socioeconomic survey has determined that the majority of Thanh Hoa\u2019s population is \nKinh  and  that  the  non-Kinh  population  has  long  assimilated  with  the  Kinh  majority.  Urban \ninfrastructure development is not expected to have any direct impact on ethnic minority groups. \nIf  indigenous  people  turn  out  to  be  living  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas,  any  ethnic  minority \nissues will be addressed according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n46. \nBased  on  the  preliminary  design,  a  survey  and  inventory  of  assets  were  carried  out  to \nidentify resettlement impacts. An estimated 49.4 ha of land will be permanently acquired by the \nProject.  Most  land  slated  for  acquisition  is  agricultural  land  (48.1  ha)  while  the  remainder  is \nresidential  land  (0.4  ha)  and  government  land  (0.9  ha).  A  total  of  726  households  and  eight \ninstitutions were identified as project affected persons. Of these, about 546 households will be \nseverely affected due to (i) loss of 10% or more of their productive assets such as paddy land \n(519  households);  and  (ii)  relocation  of  houses  (24  households).  A  full  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  prepared  with  an  estimated  cost  of  $4.9  million.  This  covers  compensation  payment  for \nland  and  non-land  assets  at  replacement  cost,  allowance,  relocation,  and  income  restoration \nmeasures,  administrative  costs,  and  contingency  costs.  During  detailed  design,  efforts  will  be \nmade  to  further  avoid,  or  at  least  minimize,  impacts  through  consultation  with  local  authorities \nand  affected  persons.  The  resettlement  plan  will  then  be  updated  and  disclosed  to  affected \npersons  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  full  resettlement  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n\nB. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n47. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) to screen potential \nenvironmental impacts of the proposed investments, formulate mitigation measures, and propose \ninstitutional  arrangements.  The  IEE  report  indicates  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nProject\u2019s  components,  as  a  whole,  will  not  be  significant.  However,  special  measures  will  be \ntaken to ensure that restoration works at the Dong Son archaeological area do not damage any \ncultural, historical, or archaeological relics. In coordination with the Department of Culture and \nInformation,  prevailing  regulations will  be  enforced  to  account  for  any  undiscovered  items  that \nmay  be  excavated  during  restoration  and  upgrading  of  this  site.  Mitigation  measures  for  other \nproject  interventions,  such  as  construction  and  improvement  of  arterial  and  secondary  roads, \nexpansion of water supply and drainage network, replacement of damaged water supply pipes, \nand construction of two wastewater plants, can be undertaken without difficulty through proper \nengineering  design,  incorporation  of  recommended  mitigation  measures,  and  community \nparticipation.  For  urban  road  development,  the  main  concerns  are  noise  and  dust  pollution \nduring construction. These impacts are short-term and will be minimized by proposed mitigation \nmeasures and good engineering and construction practices, as well as through the involvement \nof  communities  and  other  stakeholders  in  project  planning,  design,  and  implementation.  For \nwastewater treatment, the environmental concerns are odor and pollution of water bodies from \nthe  wastewater  stabilization  ponds.  The  inlet  works  will  be  covered  with  removable  covers  to \nminimize odors. In the construction phase, social issues related to land acquisition, compensation, \nand resettlement will be addressed through the implementation of a resettlement plan. \n\nDuring  the  detailed  design  phase, an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  each \n48. \nproject component shall be prepared based on the detailed design and the proposed mitigation \nmeasures and implementation arrangements outlined in the IEE. The detailed EMP shall cover \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f1717 \n\nthe  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation  stages  of  each  project  component.  EMP \nprovisions  shall  be  described  in  the  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  An  environmental \nmanagement  unit  will  be  set  up  within  the  PPMU  to  be  responsible  for  implementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring.  Each  project  component  will  be  delegated \nto  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  which  will  each  have  a  designated  environment \nspecialist.  The  monitoring  of  environmental  performance  of  contractors  and  preparation  of \ncorresponding monitoring reports shall be undertaken by the construction supervision consultant \nin coordination with the PPMU's environmental management unit and PIU. The PPMU and PIU \nwill collaborate with the Environmental Monitoring and Protection Center (within the Department \nof  Natural  Resources  and  Environment),  the  Department  of  Science  and  Technology,  and  the \nDepartment of Health to test water quality. Environmental monitoring results will be documented \nto  ensure  that  signs  of  adverse  impacts  are  detected  at  the  earliest  possible  time.  Monitoring \nresults before and during construction will be reported monthly by the designated environment \nspecialist  in  the  PPMU.  An  annual  monitoring  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  PPMU's \nenvironmental management unit and submitted to the PPMU head, who will in turn submit it to \nthe  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  for  endorsement  to  the  THP  People's \nCommittee.  The  monitoring  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  together  with  the  semi-annual \nprogress reports. The summary initial environmental examination and IEE are in Supplementary \nAppendixes I and J. \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n49. \nThe project components are mutually reinforcing and have positive externalities. Overall \nreturns to project investment are likely to be greater than the sum of the individual components. \nThe proposed Project is a comprehensive and multisectoral project that will direct investments \nto priority areas and create a sustainable urban environment for Thanh Hoa and strengthen its \nrole of provincial capital by becoming an urban service center for the province. \n\n50. \nFor the road development component, the Project will yield a net present value of some \n$8.6  million  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  17.2%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nshows a relatively stable EIRR, mostly affected if benefits are delayed by a year, which would \nyield  an  EIRR  of  15.4%.  For  the  water  supply  component,  the  results  of  the  base-case  EIRR \nanalysis  show  an  EIRR  of  14.9%.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  acceptable,  with  a  reduction  of  about \n1% in the EIRR. For the drainage component, it is projected that about 143,000 people will live \nin  the  urban  core  by  2025,  of  which  at  least  50,000  could  be  affected  by  flooding.  Pollution \nwould continue to build up in urban and nearby waterways, providing a significant health hazard \nto inhabitants and visitors alike. The Project will not eliminate flooding entirely but it will reduce \nthe  severity  and  duration  of  flooding.  For  the  human  resource  development  component,  the \neconomic rationale for subcomponent selection is based on the expected benefits of vocational \ntraining on tourism and industrial development. For the tourism component, Thanh Hoa expects \n49,900 additional visitors in the first year of the Project, rising to 342,000 in 2035. The EIRR is \nestimated  to  be  19%  and  is  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  by  20%  in  tourists\u2019  spending,  which \nyields an EIRR of 16%. Lastly, EIRR is 16% if average daily expenditures by tourists are less \nthan  20%.  The  outline  of  the  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  10  and  the  full  version  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n51. \nThe  preliminary  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2006).  It  is  based  on \nincremental  benefits  and  costs,  and  has  been  undertaken  for  two  revenue  generating \ncomponents  of  the  Project:  (i)  water  supply  development  and  expansion,  and  (ii)  wastewater \n\n \n\n\ftreatment.  The  analysis  is  also  based  on  the  ability  of  the  Executing  Agency  to  repay  its  debt \nobligations  for  the  other  nonrevenue  generating  components  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  the \nfinancial  analysis  includes  a  sustainability  analysis  that  assesses  whether  these  revenue \ngenerating  components  can  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  capital  investment  and \noperation costs, as measured by financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), and meet or exceed \nthe weighted cost of capital (WACC) of 1.5% used to finance these projects. \n\n52. \nFor water supply, the investment should contribute to improving the existing distribution \nnetwork  and  expanding  the  service  area  to  urban  villages  (about  75,000  inhabitants  with  an \naverage daily consumption of 70 liters per capita). Initial projections indicate a need to increase \nwater tariffs (by 25% in 2009 and 15% in 2010) to achieve full cost recovery. The FIRR over the \nperiod of the loan is estimated at 15.3% and sensitivity analysis revealed that it is most sensitive \nto an increase in O&M costs and a delay in the tariff increase. \n\n53. \nThe investment in the drainage and wastewater treatment plant will reduce flooding and \nremove wastewater from the eight inner urban wards, improve sewage through the construction \nof a 20 km sewer system, and build a wastewater treatment plant with a treatment capacity of \nup  to  10,000  m3  per  day  for  the  urban  core.  At  the  same  time  it  will  upgrade  the  existing \ndrainage  network  and  construct  additional  primary  and  secondary  drains.  The  financial \nprojection  indicated  that  regular  tariff  increases  would  be  necessary  to  achieve  basic  cost \nrecovery.  FIRR  for  drainage  and  wastewater  is  estimated  at  4.2%  and  is  most  sensitive  to  a \ndelay  in  the  tariff  increase.  The  financial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  detailed  financial \nassessment of the people\u2019s committee is in Supplementary Appendix L. The financial analysis \nof public operating entities (THWSC and URENCO) is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n54. \nProject  risks  include  the  potential  lack  of  commitment  from  the  Project\u2019s  beneficiaries \n(resulting from a lack of ownership), currency fluctuations and other macroeconomic changes, \nunanticipated external economic events, and decentralized project administration. The following \nmeasures will be taken to mitigate these risks: (i) extensive consultations with key stakeholders \nduring project preparation, (ii) provision of a safe buffer in terms of higher contingency amounts, \nand (iii) close monitoring by ADB using performance-based indicators during implementation. \n\nThe Project\u2019s success is based on the following assumptions: (i) the Government, ADB, \n55. \nand  key  stakeholders  ensure  that  qualified  consultants  and  personnel  are  recruited  for  the \nProject  and  that  disbursements  of  counterpart  and  other  funds  are  made  in  a  timely  manner; \n(ii)  commitment  of  people's  committees  to  undertake  policy  and  institutional  reforms;  \n(iii)  implementation  of  suggested  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  tariff  adjustments;  (iv)  active \nfrom  stakeholders  and  project  beneficiaries;  \nparticipation  and  sense  of  ownership \n(v)  stakeholder  and  beneficiary  support \nimplementation  of \nfor \nenvironmental, social, and resettlement requirements. \n\nthe  Project;  and  (vi) \n\nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nAssurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n56. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\nThe THP People's Committee will be the Executing Agency for the Project. Within \n1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  PPMU, \nresponsible  for  engaging  and  supervising  the  work  of  all  consultants  and  for \nmanaging and coordinating project implementation with all levels of Government \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f1919 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nas well as with ADB and other cofinanciers as applicable. The PPMU will be fully \nstaffed at all times during project implementation. \n\nThe  PIUs,  under  the  authority  of  the  PPMU,  will  liaise  with  the  communities \naffected under the Project through the CMC, to be established within 3 months of \nthe  effective  date.  The  CMC  shall  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement  plan,  the  IEE,  the  gender  action  plan,  as  well  as  the  resolution  of \nany  related  issues  that  may  arise  at  the  community  level.  The  CMC  will  report \nback  to  the  PIUs  and  the  PPMU  through  monthly  progress  meeting;  the  PPMU \nshall keep records of minutes of meetings. \n\nTHP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure \nthat  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation, adequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart funds are \nmade and released by the relevant authorities on a timely and regular basis. \n\nTHP People\u2019s Committee will allocate all necessary operations and maintenance \n(O&M)  resources  for  all  the  investments  components  funded  under  the  Project. \nThroughout  project  implementation  and  with  the  assistance  of  the  supervision \nconsultants, the PPMU will prepare and submit to ADB an annual O&M plan, with \nresources  allocation,  by  31  October  of  each  year  starting  2009.  The  O&M  plan \nwill be endorsed by both THP People\u2019s Committee and the Thanh Hoa People's \nCommittee. \n\nTHP People\u2019s Committee will ensure that the following legislation will be applied \nto THWSC and URENCO: (a) Decree 117/2007/ND-CP, resulting in an equitized \nTHWSC  that  operates  on  full  cost  recovery;  and  (b)  Decree  88/2007/ND-CP, \nresulting in URENCO operating at cost recovery. Any shortfall in the revenues of \nTHWSC  or  of  URENCO  will  be  funded  from  the  THP  and  Thanh  Hoa  budgets \nbased on annual financial forecasts submitted by the consultants. \n\nBefore the end of the year 2009, ADB and THP People\u2019s Committee will (a) take \nstock  of  the  capacity  building  financed  under  CDIA  and  WFPF,  and  (b)  update \nthe schedule for equitization and policy reforms in line with the requirement of the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam.  THP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  take  all  necessary  and \nappropriate  actions  to  ensure  the  timely  implementation  of  such  institutional \nreform and policy agenda, based on the initial program set in Appendix 4, which \ndetails all the anticipated actions required. \n\n(vii)  Within  2  years  of  completing  the  city  development  strategy  funded  by  Cities \nAlliance,  THP  People\u2019s Committee  will  finalize an  updated draft  Master  Plan  for \nsubmission to the Prime Minister\u2019s office including details on funding sources for \ncapital  expenditures  and  O&M,  the  agency  responsible  for  implementing  the \nvarious components of the master plan, as well as a timetable for implementing \nthe various components of the plan. \n\n(viii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, THP People\u2019s Committee will constitute an \nadvisory group to provide inputs and feedback for the design and implementation \nof  the  human  resources  component,  in  particular  on  the  type  of  skills \ndevelopment  needed.  The  advisory  group  will  comprise  representatives  from \nvocational  training  centers,  from  relevant  industries  (in  particular  tourism, \nmanufacturing, and processing), from the relevant industrial zones, DOLISA, and \nfrom VWU. \n\n(ix)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PPMU  will  finalize  a  detailed  needs \nassessment,  with  budget  allocation,  for  the  human  resources  development \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ncomponent under the Project. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nTHP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate  measures  to \nensure  that  staff  of  the  vocational  training  center  that  receive  capacity  building \nunder the Project will remain in their position for a period of at least 2 years. \n\nTHP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure  that  all  works  contracts  under  the  Project \nincorporate  provisions  in  the  bidding  documents,  with  the  necessary  budget \nallocation,  to  require  that  contractors:  (a)  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws \nand  core  labor  standards,  (b)  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  or \nmaintenance  activities,  and  (c)  do  not  provide  differential  wages  or  benefits  to \nmen and women for work of equal value. \n\n(xii) \n\nTHP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure  that  PPMU  and  all  PIUs  implement  the \nProject  in  accordance  with  the  gender  action  plan  agreed  upon  between  THP \nPeople\u2019s  Committee  and  ADB  and  sufficient  resources  will  be  allocated  for  its \nimplementation. \n\n(xiii)  Within 1 month of setting-up, the PPMU will establish a project website that will \ndisclose  relevant  procurement-related  information.  The  website  will  be  updated \nwithin 2 weeks of each contract award. \n\n(xiv)  THP People\u2019s Committee will ensure that the detailed design of project activities \nas  well  as  project  implementation  will  be  done  in  close  consultation  with  all \nstakeholders.  This  will  include  consultations  with  private  sector  representatives, \nas well as with representatives from communities and urban poor. The PPMU will \norganize in close collaboration with the PIUs and the PSC: (a) during the design \nphase  of  the  project,  four  stakeholders  and  dissemination  workshops  in  Thanh \nHoa to present the different stages of the project design: inception, basic design, \ndraft detailed design, bidding documents; and (b) during project implementation, \none workshop per year to present the status of the project implementation. \n\n(xv) \n\nThe Government will ensure that all land and right-of-way required for the Project \nwill be made available in a timely manner and that compensation at replacement \ncost  and  other  entitlements  will  be  provided  prior  to  the  awards  of  civil  work \ncontracts,  and  prior  to  affected  people  being  displaced  from  their  houses,  land, \nand  assets.  Any  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nthe resettlement plan agreed upon between THP People\u2019s Committee and ADB, \nthe  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  resettlement,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy.  In  case  of  discrepancy  between  Vietnamese  and  ADB \npolicy,  ADB  policy  will  prevail.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  following \ndetailed design and publicly disclosed in places and using language accessible to \nall affected people, prior to submission to ADB, for its review and approval prior \nto  award  of  any  related  civil  works  contracts.  The  THP  People\u2019s  Committee  will \nalso  submit  internal  and  external  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  for  uploading  on \nADB\u2019s website, in a language accessible to all affected people. \n\n(xvi)  THP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  Project  is  carried  out  in \naccordance with the environmental laws and regulations of Viet Nam and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002);  and  (b)  all  monitoring,  mitigation,  capacity  building, \nconsultation, and reporting measures are indicated in the IEE and the EMP. THP \nthat  environmental  requirements  will  be \nPeople\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure \nincorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  In  case  of  discrepancy \nbetween  Vietnamese  and  ADB  policy,  ADB  policy  will  prevail.  In  the  event  of  a \n\n\f2121 \n\nchange  in  project  design  that  could  cause  significant  additional  environmental \nimpacts,  THP  People\u2019s  Committee  will  ensure  that  an  environmental  study  and \nimpact  assessment  will  be  undertaken  and  that  the  necessary  approval  and \nclearances  are  obtained.  Such  changes  in  the  design  will  be  screened  for \nenvironmental significance and environmental category determined. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following conditions will be met prior to the loan becoming effective: \n\nA PPMU will have been established. The PIUs will have been nominated. \n\nThe  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  Ministry  of  Finance  and  THWSC,  on \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB, will have become effective, subject only \nto the effectiveness of the loan agreement between ADB and the Borrower. \n\nThe loan agreement between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  shall  have  become  effective,  subject  only  to \neffectiveness of the loan agreement between ADB and the Borrower. \n\n57. \n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n58. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 48,321,000 \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Thanh  Hoa  City  Comprehensive \nSocioeconomic Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with \nan  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  and  Project  Agreement \npresented to the Board; \nthe  administration,  by  ADB,  of  a  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,200,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Thanh  Hoa  City \nComprehensive  Socioeconomic  Development  Project  from  the  Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility; and \nthe administration, by ADB, of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Thanh  Hoa  City  Comprehensive \nSocioeconomic  Development  Project  from  the  Netherlands  Trust  Fund  for  the \nWater Financing Partnership Facility. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n11 February 2009 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \n \nSustainable socioeconomic \ndevelopment of Thanh Hoa \nCity (Thanh Hoa) \n\nOutcome \n \nThanh Hoa as a well-\nmanaged, livable and \ncompetitive city \n \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \nNational, provincial, and \nlocal government statistics \n \nReports by various \ndevelopment partners \n\n \nAssumption \nImplementation  of  policies \npromoting  direct \ninvestment \nand reducing red tape. \n \nRisks \nEconomic downturn \n \nIncreased out-migration from \nTHP and Thanh Hoa \n \nThanh Hoa\u2019s territory does \nnot increase by 2015 \n\n \nGovernment statistics; \ntraffic flow studies; public \nhealth data; investment \ndata asset registers \n \nData on tourists and \ntourist establishments; \nrevenues generated from \ntourism \n \nData on foreign and \ndomestic investments; \nindustrial output \n \nData on tourists and \ntourist establishments; \nrevenues generated from \ntourism \n\n \nAssumptions \nCommitment of people\u2019s \ncommittees  to undertake \npolicy and institutional \nreforms \n \nRisks \nCurrency fluctuations; \nunanticipated external \neconomic events \n \nAnticipated economic \nopportunities, comparative \nadvantages and private \nsector investments do not \nmaterialize \n \n\n \n\n \n\nIncrease of annual GDP per \ncapita from $1,092 (2008) to \n$2,086 (2020) \n \nIncrease local and foreign \ndirect investment by 100% \nwithin 5 years of project \ncompletion (2020) \n \n \n\nImproved management and \ntechnical capacity to deliver \nurban services (roads, water \nsupply, drainage, and \nwastewater treatment) by \n2015 \n \nTravel time from peri-urban \nareas in the south to the city \ncenter reduced by half by \n2015 \nDecreased incidence of \nwaterborne disease in peri-\nurban areas by 50% by 2015 \n \nIncreased industrial \nproductivity by 25% and \nexports outside the province \nby 25% by 2015 \n \nIncreased tourist arrivals by \n50% by 2015 \n \nIncreased employment rate in \ntourism and industrial sectors \nby 50% by 2015 \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

This  transition  has  been \nmade possible by political stability, government commitment for economic reforms, and targeted \nprograms  to  provide  basic  public  infrastructure.  From  1993  to  2006,  poverty  declined  from \n58.1% to 22.0%, gross domestic product per capita increased from $288 to $622, and economic \noutput  rose  by  an  average  of  7.5%  per  year. 1 Agriculture's  share  in  total  economic  output \ndeclined from 30% to 21% while manufacturing and services rose from 70% to  79%. Between \n2001 and 2006, industrial production and domestic and international trade grew at an average \nannual  rate  of  17%,  while  foreign  direct  investment  increased  by  650%.  The  Government  is \nincreasingly  recognizing  the  private  sector\u2019s  pivotal  role  in  economic  development  and  job \ncreation. Preliminary estimates indicate that the private sector generated almost 90% of the 7.5 \nmillion  jobs  created  during  the  5  years  to  2005,  of  which  64%  were  generated  by  small \nenterprises. \n\n2. \nEconomic  development  is  also  reflected  in  the  rapid  growth  of  urban  areas.  With  a \npopulation of 85 million, only 19.6 million (23%) live in urban areas, while 65.4 million (77%) live \nin rural areas. However, this is rapidly changing. As the rate of urban population growth rate has \naveraged  5.4%  per  year  during  the  past  10  years,  it  is  expected  that  by  2020  the  urban \npopulation  will  comprise  41.6  million  (40%)  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  projected  population  of  104  million. \nHowever,  most  of  the  urban  growth  is  occurring  in  the  metropolises  of  Ho  Chi  Minh  City \n(population  5.2  million)  and  Ha  Noi  (population  3.1  million),  followed  by  Hai  Phong  and  Da \nNang. The next tier of secondary cities2 is experiencing lower growth rates. As a result, major \nmetropolises are receiving large inflows of migration, are becoming more congested , and are \nexperiencing  increasingly  serious  social  and  environmental  problems.  At  the  same  time, \nsecondary  cities  are  stagnating.  If  the  neglect  of  secondary  city  development  continues,  the \nspatial and economic disparities will further constrain not only urban development, but also Viet \nNam\u2019s overall economic development. \n\n3. \nThe  main  challenges  facing  secondary  cities  stem  from  obsolete  urban  infrastructure \nand  lack  infrastructure  investments,  particularly  in  road  networks,  water  supply,  environmental \ntreatment,  solid  waste \nsanitation  (drainage,  sewerage,  hazardous  waste,  wastewater \nmanagement, and air pollution control), power, and communications. The lack of infrastructure \ndiscourages  outside  investments  that  are  critical  to  catalyzing  economic  development  and \ngrowth.  The  causes  are  multifaceted  but  interrelated,  and  include  but  are  not  limited  to: \n(i)  inadequate  financing  and  cost  recovery  for  capital  expenditures  and  operation  and \nmaintenance;  (ii)  the  existence  of  policy,  institutional,  and  structural  bottlenecks  that  deter \nprivate  investment  that  could  free  up  scarce  government  resources;  and  (iii)  limited  human \nresource  capacity  to  plan,  operate,  and  manage  urban  assets  and  provide  urban  services. \nAlleviating  these  constraints  has  proved  difficult  as  population  increases  have  put  additional \npressure on public services provision, reduced living standards, and polluted the environment. \nThe  absence  of  strong  and  effective  governance  and  broad-based  support  and  participation \nfrom  civil  society  (including  the  private  sector,  community  groups,  and  societal  organizations) \nhas compounded these problems. \n\n                                                 \n1  Poverty is based on data obtained from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, 2005. \n2  Secondary  cities,  defined  here  as  class  II  cities,  have  populations  of  250,000  or  more.  A  detailed  definition  is  in \n\nfootnote 1, page 2. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nB. \n\nRegulatory Framework and Strategies for Urban Development \n\n4. \nThe  lack  of  an  enforceable  regulatory  framework  for  urban  infrastructure  provision  as \nwell  as  effective  institutions  has  constrained  effective  and  efficient  infrastructure  service \nprovision.  Since  1990  the  Government  has  introduced  policies  and  reforms  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  urban  sector  and  promote  urban  development 3  which  aim  to  (i)  promote \nbalanced and sustainable economic growth between regions, (ii) develop urban areas to create \nmore  jobs  and  improve  living  standards,  and  (iii)  strengthen  environmental  protection  and \nensure  a  healthy  environment.  The  Government  has  endorsed  a  series  of  orientation  plans \nrelated to urban development.4 \n\n5. \nCurrently  there  are  11  secondary  cities,  designated  as  class  II  cities,  that  have  been \npromoted  as  target  cities  to  limit  growth  in  Ha  Noi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  As  a  part  of  ADB\u2019s \nurban development assistance strategy for Viet Nam, class II candidates are being targeted for \nassistance  and  investments  to  upgrade  and  expand  urban  infrastructure  along  with  \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments in capacity building, institutional reform, and societal participation. The assistance \nis  also  designed  to  attract  development  partners,  the  private  sector,  and  other  sources  of \nfunding  to  further  enhance  city  development.  For  selection  purposes,  several  criteria  were \ndeveloped:  (i)  urban  population  growth,  (ii)  urban  and  rural  poverty  level,  (iii)  economic \ndevelopment  potential,  (iv)  infrastructure  needs,  and  (v)  special  features  that  could  potentially \nbe developed (e.g., tourism, cultural heritage, sustainable industrial development, environmental \nfeatures).  Based  on  these  criteria,  Thanh  Hoa  City  was  selected  as  a  model  project  for \nsocioeconomic development. \n\nC. \n\nUrban Development in Thanh Hoa \n\nThanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa) became a class II in 2004. It is the capital, administrative \n6. \ncenter,  and  only  major  urban  center  of  Thanh  Hoa  Province  (THP)  Viet  Nam\u2019s  third  largest \nprovince  with  a  population  of  3.7  million.  THP\u2019s gross  domestic  product  per  capita  is  only  half \nthe country average and its economic growth rate over the past 5 years is below the county\u2019s \n7.5%.  Its  rates  of  unemployment  (50%)  and  poverty  level  (30%)  are  both  well  above  national \naverages. THP is the second poorest province in Viet Nam and investment in infrastructure has \nbeen  lagging.  However  its  industrial  output  has  been  increasing  significantly,  currently \naccounting for 22.8% of the province's total economic output. \n\n7. \nThanh Hoa is located at the confluence of Ma and Chu rivers. Aside from the limestone \npeaks framing the city to the north and west, the city is relatively flat. The National Highway 1A \nand  Le  Loi  Avenue,  the  main  thoroughfares,  intersect  at  the  city  center  and  serve  as  the \n                                                 \n3  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2003.  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  2001\u20132010,  Social \n\nEconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 and Orientation Plan for Urban Development to 2020. Hanoi. \n\n4  The  Orientation  Plan  for  Urban  Development  to  2020  seeks  to  develop  cities  as  economic  growth  centers, \nmodernize  technical  and  social  infrastructure  to  attract  investment  and  improve  living  standards,  reduce  gaps \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  ensure  sustainable  urban  development.  The  Orientation  Plan  for  Water \nSupply Development to 2020 aims to upgrade and expand water supply system to ensure 100% coverage and 24-\nhour uninterrupted service in urban areas by 2020, reduce nonrevenue water to 30% and ensure full cost recovery \nfor  capital  expenditures  and  operation  and  maintenance,  equitize  all  publicly  owned  water  utility  companies  by \n2010,  protect  water  sources,  and  promote  public  awareness  and  participation.  The  Orientation  Plan  for  Urban \nDrainage Development to 2020 seeks to upgrade drainage and sewerage systems to ensure 80\u201390% coverage by \n2020, require enterprises to have on-site treatment for toxic  waste, eliminate pit latrines in urban areas by 2010, \nprovide  collection  systems  for  solid  and  liquid  waste,  and  rehabilitate  drainage  systems.  Lastly,  the  Orientation \nPlan  for  Solid  Waste  Management  and  Industrial  Waste  to  2020  aims  to  collect  and  dispose  of  at  least  95%  of \nurban  and  industrial  waste  by  2020,  complete  the  legal  framework  to  complement  the  Law  on  Environmental \nProtection,  increase  investments  in  solid  waste  management  infrastructure,  and  promote  public  awareness  on \nenvironmental hygiene and protection. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbackbone of the street system in Thanh Hoa. The city center has a system of canals that form a \nmoat to an ancient citadel; the canals drain into the Ma River. Since being upgraded to a class II \ncity,  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  area  has  expanded  to  60  square  kilometers  (km2),  comprising  12  wards \ncovering 23 km2, and six communes occupying the remainder.  \n\nThanh Hoa has three main industrial zones, namely Le Mon (88 ha, 23 factories) to the \n8. \nsoutheast along highway 47 Tay Bac Ga (67 ha, 62 factories); Dinh Huong (30 ha, 30 factories) \nto the northwest, close to National Highway A1; and Nui Vuc stone quarries to the southwest. \nOther industrial zones nearby but outside of Thanh Hoa are the Bim Son, Lang Son, and Nghi \nSon industrial zones. Outside the urban core toward the south is a suburban area composed of \npaddy  fields,  villages,  and  townships.  About  35%  of  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  total  population  lives  in  this \narea. Among Thanh Hoa\u2019s potential tourist zones are the Ham Rong tourism zone north of the \ncity,  which  has  nice  limestone  scenery  and  several  historical  relics;  the  Dong  Son \narchaeological park, which depicts Thanh Hoa\u2019s 2,500-year culture; Mat Son, a river walk close \nto the city center; handicraft and stone processing villages in the southwest near Nui Vuc stone \nquarries, with big, scenic limestone rocks and a temple. Close by is Sam Son, a popular beach \nresort  town  16  kilometers  (km)  east  of  Thanh  Hoa,  and  the  Hoang  Hoa  district  north  of  Sam \nSon, with a pristine beach extending 12 km to the north. These potentially attractive areas have \nyet to be developed. \n\n9. \nThe current demographic trend indicates a shift in population growth and migration, both \nfor THP and Thanh Hoa. Thanh Hoa Province is one of the most densely populated provinces in \nViet Nam. It is expected that within the next 10  years there  will be a labor surplus of 700,000 \nbecause the population is growing at an annual rate of 3.2%. On the other hand, Thanh Hoa, \nwith a population of 200,000, has an annual population growth rate of only 1.9 %. If this trend \ncontinues,  out-migration  from  THP  will  increase,  but  not  necessarily  to  Thanh  Hoa,  which \nmeans that it will struggle to attract additional population. The tentative conclusion, therefore, is \nthat THP will supply migrants not to Thanh Hoa, but to the large metropolises of Ha Noi and Ho \nChi Minh City. Although Thanh Hoa has nearly a universal secondary-level graduation rate, only \n18% of the population has a tertiary education or professional training. There are 15 continuous \ntraining centers, 20 vocational training institutions, and one university\u2014Hong Duc in Thanh Hoa \n(6,000 students). Therefore, to improve Thanh Hoa\u2019s competitiveness and attract migration, the \nproductivity of the labor force must be improved through education and skills training. \n\n10. \nUrban  infrastructure  facilities  are  in  general  deficient.  For  urban  roads,  the  main \nthoroughfares of Le Loi and National Road 1A and their surroundings have just been upgraded \nand are in generally good condition. However, some secondary roads, most village roads, and \nroads  leading  from  the  city  center  to  the  urban  periphery  and  non-urban  areas  in  the  city  are \ndeteriorated. Travel time from urban villages to the city may take one hour or more because of \npoor road conditions. There are currently 54 km of roads. Urgent priorities for Thanh Hoa are to \ncomplete  missing  links  in  the  road  network  connecting  secondary  roads,  improve  access  to \nhandicraft villages and tourism sites, and improve operation and maintenance of road surfaces. \nPiped water supply coverage is currently around 60%. The remaining population use dug wells \nas their main water source; nonrevenue water losses are about 45%. Thanh Hoa has a 24-hour \nuninterrupted  water  supply  and  daily  consumption  is  90  liters  per  capita  per  day  (l/p/d)  in  the \nurban area and 70 l/p/d in peri-urban areas. The average daily water demand is about 45,000 \ncubic  meters  per  day  (cmd),  whereby  current  production  is  30,000  cmd,  serving  Thanh  Hoa, \nSamson, and five other  townships. Drainage is problematic as Thanh Hoa\u2019s topography is flat \nand during the rainy season up to one-third of the city is flooded. The social assessment notes \nthat  in  some  areas,  only  40%  of  households  have  latrines.  There  are  neither  wastewater \ntreatment plants nor wastewater stabilization ponds. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nThanh Hoa has developed an ambitious new master plan that aims to make Thanh Hoa \n11. \na class I city, with a population of 500,000, by 2015. Significant growth is expected to occur as a \nresult of expanding the city boundary to  150 km2 to incorporate Sam Son town. The urban core \nbuilt-up area will be upgraded, particularly with the rehabilitation of road, public parks, and open \nspaces  along  National  Highway  A1;  improvements  of  the  administrative  and  business  district  \nalong  Le  Loi  Avenue;  construction of  a  bridge crossing  the  Ma  River;  and  plans  for  building  a \nnew industrial zone during the next 10 years, to be located either in Hoang Hoa district to the \nnorth  or  Quang  Xuong  district  in  the  south.  In  addition,  there  are  expressions  of  interest  from \nprivate  investors  to  upgrade  tourism  facilities  at  Ham  Rong  and  Mat  Son;  develop  hotel \naccommodations  as  well  as  commercial  and  entertainment  centers;  and  develop  the  tourist \ntown  of  Sam  Son  and  the  Hoang  Ha  district.  Other  notable  special  features  of  Thanh  Hoa \ninclude a robust fresh seafood industry, and an attractive ecotourism area along the De River. \nThe eco-industrial reorganization and tourism development success will depend largely on the \nskill level and capacity of the local population to participate in these activities. Without improved \nskills, efficient and sustainable economic development will not be possible. \n \nD. \n\nRequired Investments for Sustainable Urban Development \n\n12. \nThanh Hoa must initiate steps to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities as well as \navert  its  threats  and  overcome  its  weaknesses.  Its  main  strengths  and  advantages  are  its \nlocation  (along  main  transportation  routes,  and  proximity  to  Ha  Noi,),  its  capacity  to  expand, \nboth economically and geographically.  \n\n13. \nOfficial  development  assistance  has  been  an  important  vehicle  to  develop  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nurban infrastructure. About $1.2 billion investments have been injected into the country's urban \nsector  since  1995,  of  which  ADB  has  provided  $450  million.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Viet \nNam\u2019s urban sector emphasizes targeted infrastructure investments in small and medium-sized \ntowns  in  the  central  region  and  along  economic  corridors,  thereby  diverting  migration  to  the \nlarge  cities,  principally  Ha  Noi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  This  will  require  large  investments  in \ninfrastructure; decentralized and improved urban governance; adequate cost recovery of urban \nservices;  improved  human  resource  capacity;  promotion  of  broad-based  participation  from  the \nprivate  sector  and  community  groups;  and  inclusive  development  that  takes  into  account \nvulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. These investments will be defined based on \nthe  City  Development  Strategy  in  a  regional  context  to  be  implemented  by  UN-Habitat  and \nfinanced by Cities Alliance.

The  strategy  notes  that  increased  private  investment  and \ninternational economic integration are crucial to creating jobs, improving living standards, and alleviating poverty. As Viet Nam \nbecomes more urbanized, cities are playing larger roles as economic growth centers and nodes of development. However, for \nthis to happen public infrastructure must be improved through broad-based participation from the private sector and society, \ntaking into account vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy for Viet Nam emphasizes \ntargeted infrastructure investments in small and medium-sized towns along economic corridors and thereby diverts migration \naway from the large cities of Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n \nThanh  Hoa  Province  (THP),  the  third  largest  province  in  Viet  Nam,  has  an  area  of  11,168  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  a \npopulation  of  3.7  million,  of  which  only  9.8%  live  in  urban  areas.  THP  is  the  second  poorest  province  in  Viet  Nam,  with  a \npoverty level of 36% (2006) and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita that is half the national average. THP also has \nthe  second  highest  population  density  among  Viet  Nam  provinces.  The  capital,  Thanh  Hoa  City  (Thanh  Hoa),  located  160 \nsouth  of  Ha  Noi,  has  a  population  of  197,500  (2006)  with  a  low-skilled  workforce  and  obsolete  urban  infrastructure  \u2014\nparticularly  road  networks,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  increasing \npopulation  density,  poverty  incidence,  and  lack  of  employment  in  rural  areas  is  gradually  transforming  agricultural  land  to \nurban  use  in  the  peripheral  areas  and  putting  pressure  on  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  existing  infrastructure  and  services,  as  well  as \ncreating pockets of poverty in the urban core due  mainly to the arrival of migrants. By addressing urgent development needs, \nthe  proposed  Project  will  enable  Thanh  Hoa  to  realize  its  vision  of  becoming  a  dynamic,  competitive,  bankable  and  livable \nsecondary  city  and  one  of  north-central  Viet  Nam's  key  commercial  hubs. The  Project  will,  among  other  things,  develop  an \nintegrated  road  network  connecting  the  city  center  with  its  peri-urban  areas,  which  will  lead  to  savings  in  travel  time  and \nshorten the distance between suppliers and markets; support water supply, sewerage, and drainage improvements to improve \nproductivity,  public  health,  and  the  general  well-being  of  the  population;  improve  job  skills  in  key  sectors  and  increase  the \nproductivity  of  the  local  workforce  in  order  to  increase  incomes  and  make  Thanh  Hoa  more  competitive  as  a  whole;  and \ndevelop  the  local  tourism  industry.  In  addition  to  the  ensuing  investment  loan,  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  grant \nproject will facilitate investments in smaller-scale, community infrastructure and services in poor urban and peri-urban areas. \nBy  providing  access  to  capital  assets  and  a  source  of  income  for  individuals  or  community  groups  operating  small-scale \nbusinesses and affordable basic urban services for individuals who currently lack access to such services, this grant will help \nmaximize the overall poverty and socioeconomic impacts of the larger investment Project. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                    Targeting Classification: General intervention \n  \nKey Issues  \nIn  general,  residents  in  peri-urban  areas  are  poorer  than  residents  in  the  urban  core.  The  lack  of  infrastructure  and  basic \nservices and physical isolation, (particularly in peri-urban areas that lack transportation access to the city), exacerbated by low \nlabor  productivity,  ill  health,  and  poor  job  skills  were  considered  the  main  causes  of  poverty  in  the  peri-urban  areas.  Low \nincomes and a lack of jobs are causing people to migrate from Thanh Hoa to more competitive cities both in Viet Nam and \nabroad.  While  the  secondary  education  graduation  rate  is  high  (77%),  the  vocational  or  tertiary  education  enrollment  levels \nare  low  (17%).  With  the  share  of  agriculture  in  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  total  economic  output  on  the  decline,  the  manufacturing  and \nservice sectors  (particularly tourism and trade) are assuming increased importance in creating jobs. Thanh Hoa will need to \nembark  on  socially  inclusive  development  that  targets  poor  peri-urban  dwellers  and  vulnerable  groups  and  promotes \ninvestment in citywide infrastructure, human resource development, and improved urban management. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nFindings of Social Analysis \nA social impact assessment was carried out to assess the socioeconomic profile of Thanh Hoa; analyze the social dimension \nof  poverty;  identify  key  issues  and  potential  project  impacts  on  women,  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities  and  vulnerable  groups; \nrecommend  opportunities  for  pro-poor  design  of  the  project  components;  and  suggest  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators. \nSecondary  data  collection,  interviews,  and  a  socioeconomic  survey  were  used  to  obtain  data.  The  assessment  highlighted \nthat the poverty rate in urban wards was about 13.6%. The assessment concluded that, although the poverty rate has been \ndecreasing,  Thanh  Hoa  will  need  to  embark  on  socially  inclusive  development  that  targets  poor  peri-urban  dwellers  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nvulnerable  groups  and  promotes  investment  in  citywide  infrastructure,  human  resource  development,  and  improved  urban \nmanagement.  \n \nKey Issues \nA  key  social  issue  is  the  need  for  socially  inclusive  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  in  peri-urban  areas.  Other  key  issues \ninclude  the  lack  of  technical  and  service-related  skills  among  the  workforce  to  meet  the  demands  of  industry  and  tourism; \ninadequate provision of vocational skills training linked with industry growth, coupled with a low overall rate of participation in \nvocational  education,  especially  among  women;  and  the  need  for  community  consultation  and  participation  in  infrastructure \nand tourism development. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultation workshops were held during project preparation to obtain inputs from the following stakeholders: THP and Thanh \nHoa  peoples  committees,  provincial  and  city  departments,  civil  society  organizations,  representatives  of  vocational  training \ninstitutions, business owners, commune leaders, and project beneficiaries. Consultations were also held with women and the \nyouth  to  ensure  participation  during  project  design  and  implementation.  These  consultations  provided  useful  inputs  for \ndeveloping  the  Project\u2019s  components,  and  were  also  essential  for  preparing  appropriate  mitigation  measures  to  address \nresettlement, social impacts, and environmental impacts, and for defining a gender strategy for the Project. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nA  participation  strategy  has  been  streamlined  into  the  project  design  and  social  safeguard  documents  to  ensure  that  the \nvarious stakeholders continue to participate during implementation. The Project will work together at the commune/ward level \nand  establish  participation  structures  to  implement  infrastructure  and  community  sanitation  improvements.  Continued \ndiscussions and subsequent disclosure of social safeguard documents will be made to ensure that affected people, especially \nvulnerable  groups,  are  aware  of  proposed  mitigation  and  rehabilitation  measures,  particularly  on  the  issues  of  resettlement \nand other social impacts. \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\nKey Issues \nThe gender assessment was carried out to analyze the situation of women in the project area, their participation in the labor \nmarket  (formal  or  informal),  their  access  to  basic  social  services,  the  constraints  on  women\u2019s  access  to  the  urban  labor \nmarket,  and  the  potential  for  increased  participation  by  women  in  the  labor  market  as  tourism,  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises, and industry and trade investment increase and expand. In accordance with Viet Nam\u2019s Law on Gender Equality, \neffective July 2007, and the recent decree for the implementation of the law on gender equality (N70/2008/ND, 4 June 2008), the \nproject  interventions  will  contribute  to  promoting  gender  equity  and  opportunities  for  women  by  mainstreaming  gender-\nresponsive  strategies  across  all  the  sectors  of  intervention.  Capacity  building  to  enable  the  stakeholder  institutions  to \nimplement activities that promote equal opportunity and participation for women and men  will be provided under the project \nGender Strategy and Plan.  \nKey Actions. \n \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n  Gender plan      \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nResettlement is mostly for \ninfrastructure upgrading \nsuch as roads, water supply \nand drainage. The loss of \nagricultural land and \nassociated livelihoods and \nrelocation of households has \nbeen kept to a minimum in \nthe project design. Impact is \nsignificant, as it affects moir\u00e9 \nthan 200 persons.  \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nA full resettlement plan has been \nprepared in accordance with \nGovernment laws and ADB \nsafeguards policies and \nrequirements. Following detailed \ndesign, the resettlement plan will \nbe updated based on a detailed \nmeasurement survey to reflect \nactual impacts, relocation and \nincome restoration measures, \nand final options of affected \npersons with regard to \ncompensation and rehabilitation \nmeasures. \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nIssue \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLabor \n\n Employment     \n\n      opportunities \n\n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nThe majority of the \npopulation is Kinh; the \nremaining population long \nago assimilated with the \ngeneral population.

The  analysis  also \nincorporates some consideration related to the long-term management and operation of facilities \nto help achieve the intended project impact. \n\n2. \nThe Government of Viet Nam aims to alleviate migration pressure on Hanoi and Ho-Chi-\nMinh  City  and  achieve  more  geographically  balanced  and  sustainable,  economic  growth.  The \nnational  Orientation  Master  Plan  for  Urban  Development  to  2020  projects  that  population  in \nurban  areas  will  grow  from  14  million  in  1998  (23%)  to  38  million  by  2020  (39%).  Thanh  Hoa \nProvince (THP) is one of Viet Nam's most populous provinces and also one of its poorest. THP \nis divided into two areas, the mountainous area and the plain area. The population in 2006 was \n3.7  million  people  and  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  D22,000  billion,  equivalent  to \nabout $350 per capita. There are five urban centers: the capital, Thanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa), \nwith  a  population  of  200,000;  Sam  Son,  a  beach  resort  about  15  kilometers  (km)  from  Thanh \nHoa, and Bim Son (both about 60,000 population); Lam Son; and Nghi Son. The main crop is \nrice.  The  plain  area  has  around  2.8  million  persons,  and  with  a  density  of  more  than  1,000 \ninhabitants  per  ha  has  one  of  the  highest  rural  population  densities  in  the  world.  Important \nindustries include agro-processing, construction materials, shipbuilding and repair in Nigh Son, \nautomobile  assembly  and  components  in  Binh  Son  and  Nigh  Son,  and  hydropower  in  the \nWestern  part  of  the  province.  Tourism  activities  are  focused  on  the  beach  resort  of  Sam  Son, \nwhich attracts more than 1 million persons per year. \n\n3. \nThanh  Hoa  is  approximately  150  km  south  of  Hanoi.  The  main  industries  are \nconstruction  materials,  real  estate  construction,  and  agro-processing.  The  policy  context  and \noverarching  rationale  for  this  Project  is  driven  by  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010.  The  official  urban  national  policy  as  contained  in  the \nOrientation Master Plan for Urban Development to 2020 aims to establish population targets for \ncities and alleviate migration and population pressure on the large metropolises of Ha Noi and \nHo Chi Minh City by promoting the sustainable development of small and medium-sized cities \nsuch as Thanh Hoa. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam\u2019s urban sector emphasizes targeted \ninfrastructure  investments  in  small  and  medium-sized  towns  in  the  central  region  and  along \neconomic  corridors.  A  lack  of  urban  infrastructure  investments  is  seen  as  one  of  the \nweaknesses  facing  secondary  cities.  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  goal  is  now  to  achieve  class  I  status  and \nbecome  a  \u201dNational  City\u201d  by  2015.  The  principle  of  sustainable  growth  is  embodied  in  Thanh \nHoa\u2019s city master plan. \n\n4. \nBeyond  2011,  with  the  Project,  the  population  increases  rapidly  and  by  the  reference \nyear  2025  reaches  the  target  of  500,000  people.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  city \ncontinues to grow, but at recent trend rates by 2025 the population within the current city limits \ngrows only from about 200,000 to about 260,000, while the population outside the current city \nlimits grows from about 120,000 to 134,000. It is important to appreciate that under the without-\nproject scenario, Thanh Hoa would grow anyway, partly as a result of natural investment inflows \nincreases in economic activity. Without the Project, Thanh Hoa is unlikely to decline in absolute \nterms.  Rather,  without  the  project  the  population  will  not  grow  as  rapidly,  as  the  proposed \nproject will help increase economic opportunity and activity as well as provide infrastructure and \nservices for the planned growth in line with the city master plan. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n5. \nA  GDP  comparison  with  other  provinces  demonstrates  that  Thanh  Hoa  is  one  of  the \npoorest  in  Viet  Nam  and  that  it  lags  behind  other  provinces.  In  2005,  GDP  per  capita  was \nsecond  lowest  of  all  the  provinces.  It  was  only  half  the  national  average  and  less  than  one \nquarter  that  of  Hanoi.  If  current  trends  are  allowed  to  continue,  Thanh  Hoa,  although  it  is  a \nprovincial capital, will not be able to attract the necessary investments and serve as a regional \nhub of north central Viet Nam. \n\n6. \nThe project components are mutually reinforcing and have positive externalities. Overall \nreturns to project investment are likely to be greater than the sum of the individual components. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  a  comprehensive  and  multi-sectoral  project  that  intends  to  target  the \nmain  priority  investments  and  create  a  suitable  and  sustainable  urban  environment  for  Thanh \nHoa  and  strengthen  its  role  of  provincial  capital  by  becoming  an  urban  service  center  for  the \nprovince.  The  expected  outputs  will  be:  (i)  an  improved  urban  road  network  and  associated \nbasic urban services, through the construction of about 20 kilometers (km) of new and upgraded \nroads; (ii) an expanded water supply distribution network, including about 20 km of primary and \nsecondary  piped  water  supply  pipes  and  water  connections;  (iii)  improved  drainage  and \nwastewater  treatment  through  the  construction  of  47  km  of  interceptors  for  sewerage  and \ndrainage and two wastewater treatment facilities; (iv) a well developed tourism infrastructure at \nthe tourist sites of Ham Rong, and Mat Son as well as the archaeological site of Dong Son; and \n(v) improved labor productivity and job skills achieved by developing vocational training centers. \n\nB. \n\nUrban Transport Component  \n\n7. \nViet Nam\u2019s Highway No. 1, which connects  Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, runs through the \ncenter of Thanh Hoa. Across the city\u2019s east-west axis lies Route 47, which leads to Sam Son on \nthe coast. A traffic count found daily traffic in the region to be as follows: (i) Tran Phu (Highway \nNo.  1):  18,300  passenger  car  units  (PCU)/day;  (ii)  Le  Loi:  21,657  PCU/day;  and  (iii)  Nui  Vap: \n1,238  PCU/day.  Traffic  counts  were  undertaken  on  the  Eastern  Belt  with  367  PCU/day  and \nWestern Belt with 286 PCU/day. \n\nTable A9: Traffic Count for Thanh Hoa \n\nPCU Conversion \nFactor \n\nThanh Hoa Traffic \nComposition in 2008 \n\nMini-Bus and Light Truck \n\nVehicle Type \n\nCar  \n\nMedium Truck  \n\nMotorbike \n\nBicycle \n\n \n\nTotal  \nPCU = passenger car units. \nSource: Thanh Hoa City statistics. \n\n1.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.2 \n\n \n\n1% \n\n5% \n\n9% \n\n63% \n\n22% \n\n100% \n\n8. \nTraffic growth in Thanh Hoa is forecast to grow at 10% per annum until 2019 and at 8% \nper  annum  thereafter.  The    road  design  acknowledged  the  varying  characteristics  of  existing \ninfrastructure in the area and recommended that the water and wastewater connections as well \nas  the  drainage  works  be  implemented  simultaneously  with  the  road  works.  To  determine  the \nnet benefits, the least cost method was used. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nOver the analysis period to 2035, total travel time saved as a result of the Project was \n9. \nestimated at about 84 million minutes \u2013 a reduction in travel time of some 43% compared with \nthe without-project case. Economic costs for the road projects total some $19.7 million in capital \ncosts, and another $0.49 million in annual operations and maintenance. Under the base case, \nthe  Project  yields  a  net  present  value  of  some  $8.6  million  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) of 17.2%. EIRR remains solid in sensitivity tests. In a scenario of costs increasing \nto 10%, EIRR remains relatively stable at 16.1%, and if benefits decrease to 10%, the EIRR is \n15.9%. If benefits are delayed by a year, EIRR is 15.4%. \n\nC. \n\nWater Supply Expansion and Upgrading Component \n\n10.  Water  supply  in  Thanh  Hoa  is  provided  by  Thanh  Hoa  Water  Supply  Company \n(THWSC). The company covers Thanh Hoa, Bim Son, Sam Son, and other small settlements. \nCoverage  in  Thanh  Hoa  is  estimated  at  90%  for  the  urban  population  and  60%  for  the  \nperi-urban population. The estimated population served in 2007 is 160,000.  \n\nIt is proposed that the Project provide finance for a 20 km pipe network in the city core. \n11. \nThis represents nearly all (20 km of 24 km) of the remaining pipe network not replaced under \nanother  ADB  loan  project.1 For  the  replacement  of  pipes  in  the  city  core,  cost  effectiveness  is \naddressed by the amount of nonrevenue water generated. \n\n12. \nIn line with national Government guidelines for urban water supply, it is assumed that by \n2010, the demand for water will increase to 110 liters per capita per day (lcd) for the urban core \npopulation, and to 70 lcd for the peri-urban population. The current THWSC investment program \nwill increase capacity from 50,000 m3 per day to 60,000 m3 per day by 2010. The population of \nthe city grows at higher rates and reaches 500,000 by 2025 under the with-project scenario, and \ngrows  at  slower  rates,  reaching  about  420,000  by  2025,  in  the  without-project  scenario.  The \npercentage  of  water  allocated  to  Thanh  Hoa  (as  opposed  to  other  towns  also  served  by  the \nTHWSC)  is  75%  based  on  the  current  population  distribution.  The  nonrevenue  water  is \nassumed to be 40%, decreasing to 25% with the Project. Without the Project, nonrevenue water \nis assumed to increase to 45% in 2015 and 50% by 2025. \n\nThe results of the base case EIRR analysis show an EIRR of 14.9%. Sensitivity analysis \n13. \nis satisfactory, as EIRR is 13.9% in a scenario where costs increase to 10%, and EIRR is 13.8% \nif  benefits  decrease  to  10%.  In  a  scenario  where  nonrevenue  water  decreases  to  30%,  EIRR \nremains stable at 13.8%. \n\nD. \n\nDrainage and Wastewater Treatment \n\n14. \nThe economic analysis follows accepted least-cost criteria for the analysis of wastewater \ninfrastructure investments. Specific targets of the Government include upgrading drainage and \nsewerage  systems  to  ensure  80\u201390%  coverage  by  2020.  In  terms  of  specific  sanitation \ninfrastructure development plans, the Thanh Hoa city master plan proposes separate rain water \nand wastewater systems by 2020. It also targets 100% treatment of wastewater and rain water. \n\n15. \nDrains are mostly located in Thanh Hoa in the main commercial areas and along major \nroads  and  are  in  poor  condition.  During  the  rainy  season  from  May  to  October,  when  water \ndischarge is twice that of the dry season, more than 30% of the city\u2019s urban wards flood. There \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nis  no  wastewater  treatment  plant  for  the  city.  Tanks  are  generally  poorly  constructed, \nundersized, poorly maintained, not emptied on a regular basis, and overloaded because of rapid \nurbanization.  Flooding  imposes  considerable  economic  costs,  including  property  damage, \nclean-up costs, travel difficulties, loss of employment, and serious health impacts. The Project \ntogether with ongoing Thanh Hoa projects, will provide 47 km of new drains. Overall net benefits \nwill still be constrained by the pollution and health impacts of direct discharge of wastewater into \nadjacent  waterways.  Available  sanitation  solutions  are  as  follows:  (i)  increased  septic  tank \nprovision  and  associated  support  services,  (ii)  provision  of  an  interceptor  sewer  to  transfer \nwastewater away from urban areas, and (iii) provision of a wastewater treatment plant. \n\n16. \nThe  chosen  project  components  comprise:  (i)  completion  of  the  urban  core  drainage \nsystem, comprising 7.7 km of primary network and 20 km of tertiary network; (ii) provision of a \nsingle  WSP \nnew, semi-separated sanitation and drainage network along the ring belt; (iii) a \ntreatment plant, with capacity to treat 15,000 cubic meters per day; (iv) 9.5 km of interceptors \nand six pumping stations; (v) three small-scale wastewater treatment systems; and (vi) capacity \nbuilding, gender training, and community awareness programs. Economic costs for the up-front \ndrainage and sanitation works total some $29 million. \n\n17. \nUnder the without-project scenario, the urban core is projected to house some 143,000 \npeople  by  2025,  of  which  at  least  50,000  people  could  be  affected  by  flooding.  Pollutants \nconcentrations  would  continue  to  build  up  in  urban  and  nearby  waterways,  providing  a \nsignificant  health  hazard  to  Thanh  Hoa  inhabitants  and  visitors.  Development  in  the  ring  belt \nwould  be  limited  and  would  likely  house  poorer  communities  without  access  to  basic  public \namenities. In addition, direct discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater into the Ma \nRiver could affect the attractiveness of nearby Sam Son beach as a tourist destination. Although \nflooding will not be eliminated with the Project in place, the severity and duration of flooding will \nbe reduced. \n\nE. \n\nHuman Resource Development  \n\n18. \nThe analysis focuses on the economic rationale for subcomponent selection and a broad \ndescription of expected benefits. Government  sees  vocational  training  to  be  a  weak  link  in  the \npotential  development  of  the  city.  THP\u2019s  performance  declined  significantly  in  recent  years.  A \nmore  skilled  workforce  is  needed  to  support  the  overall  Project.  The  tourism  industry  in \nparticular  will  need  skilled  workers,  as  will  the  many  new  industries  and  business  services \nexpected to set up shop in the city. Private sector institutions that demonstrated a willingness to \nparticipate and borrow, and/or are already investing in Thanh Hoa, were also given high priority \nin  subcomponent  selection.  The  proposed  Project \nincorporates  six  subcomponents \n(i)  a  vocational  college  industry,  (ii)  a  continuing  education  and  vocational  training  center, \n(iii)  a  vocational  intermediate  school  of  handicrafts,  (iv)  a  vocational  intermediate  school  of \ncommerce and tourism, (v) a vocational center for the blind, and (vi) a vocational intermediate \nschool of construction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nF. \n\nTourism Development  \n\n19. \nThanh Hoa is less than three hours away from Hanoi. Tourists can enjoy a wide variety \nof landscapes in the province, from mountains in the west to the beaches in the east, which are \namong Viet  Nam\u2019s most famous. It is also the home of Dong Son, an archaeological site with \nancient  temples  and  pagodas.  Thanh  Hoa  tourism  is  not  capitalizing  on  its  potential  for \neconomic growth. Subcomponent selection was based on: (ii) promoting historical architecture, \nhandicraft, archeology, and natural resources; (ii) providing leisure activities for local people as \nwell  as  visitors;  and  (iii)  protecting  the  natural  environment  of  the  city.  The  tourism \nsubcomponents have four main themes: (i) natural landscape and historical significance in Ham \nRong Area, (ii) heritage relics in Dong Son, (iii) limestone resources in Mat Son, and (iv) Ben En \nnational park. In total some 49,900 additional visitors to Thanh Hoa will be generated in the first \nyear of the Project, rising to 342,000 in year 2035. The EIRR for the whole tourism component \nis  estimated  to  be  19.0%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  a  robust  EIRR.  Should  costs  increase  to \n10%, EIRR decreases to 17.7%. EIRR is 17.6% if the benefits decrease to 10%, and 18.6%, if \nbenefits are delayed by a year. Lastly, EIRR is 16% if average daily expenditures by tourists are \nless than 20%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nfor \n\nThe \n\nfinancial  analysis \n\n \n1. \nthe  Thanh  Hoa  Comprehensive  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Project  (Project)  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2006)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB). The financial analysis is conducted on the basis of an incremental costs and benefits. \nThe  analysis  is  undertaken  on  two  revenue  generating  components  of  the  Project:  (i)  the \nwater  supply  development  and  expansion,  and  (ii)  the  construction  and  expansion  of \nwastewater treatment plants. It will also discuss the ability of Thanh Hoa Province to repay \nits  debt  obligations  for  the  other  nonrevenue  generating  components  in  this  Project.  The \nfinancial sustainability  of  each  of  the  revenue  generating components  was  assessed  using \nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRRs) that meet or exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC). \n\n2. \n\nKey assumptions applied in this financial analysis are: \n(i) \n\nThe financial analysis on the project entity incorporates recommendations for \ninstitutional development, especially the requirements of tariff increases, and \nconsiders  only  the  incremental  revenue  and  cost\u2014capital  expenditures  and \noperations and maintenance (O&M) associated directly with the component. \nThe FIRR and average incremental financial cost (AIFC) are calculated from \n2009 to 2029. \nIncremental revenues are equal to the projected incremental volume of water \nsold, multiplied by the recommended water tariff for water supply. \nAnother  key  assumption  is  the  estimation  of  the  required  average  tariffs  to \nfully  recover  all  components  of  the  financial  costs.  This  has  been  done  by \ncalculating  the  AIFC  for  the  Project\u2014i.e.,  basing  on  the  present  value  of \ncapital expenditures and O&M costs at financial prices divided by the volume \nof  water  sold  for  each  year  over  the  life  of  the  respective  components.  The \npresent values are calculated by discounting all cash flows at the WACC. The \nAIFC is the minimum tariff required for full cost recovery. \nAssumptions  employed  in  the  treatment  of  Urban  Environmental  Company's \n(URENCO)  financial  performance  assessment  comprised  three  parameters:  \nfinancial  projections  include  all  revenues  and  costs  incurred  by  URENCO \nover the forecasted period: 2009\u20132029; projected capital costs and operating \nrevenues  are  presented  in  dong  and  expressed  in  current  prices;  and  the \nprojection assumes that the loan proceeds will be treated as an \u201con-grant\u201d to \nURENCO. \nConsidering  the  different  service  demands,  usage  patterns,  and  abilities  to \npay  for  the  services  by  various  users,  this  analysis  has  divided  users  of \nproject  services  into  four  major  groups:  domestic,  administration,  industry, \nand services. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n3. \nWater  Supply  Tariff.  The  proposed  water  tariff  increases  are  designed  to  ensure \nthat  revenues  from  water  tariffs  cover  all  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  on  equipment \npursuant  to  the  Vietnamese  Government  Decree  117/2007/ND-CP  dated  11  July  2007, \nwhich  requires  all  water  companies  to  operate  on  a  full-cost-recovery  basis.  The \nrecommended tariff increase is summarized in Table A11.1 below. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nTable A11.1: Recommended Level of Water Tariff Increase \n\n \n\nYear \nWater Supply tariff increase (%)a, b \nD/m3 \nDomestic (average) \nD/m3 \n  - less than 10 m3 \nD/m3 \n  - from 11 m3 to 20 m3 \nD/m3 \n  - from 21 m3 to 30 m3 \nD/m3 \n  - above 30 m3 \nD/m3 \nNondomestic \nD/m3 \nAdministration \nD/m3 \nIndustry \nD/m3 \nServices \nFull Cost Recovery (%)c \nSubsidy from Province (D Million)d \nSubsidy from Province (%) \nm3 = cubic meter. \na \nb \n\n2008 \n\n \n4,100 \n3,100 \n3,700 \n4,400 \n5,200 \n \n6,200 \n6,500 \n7,000 \n70\n9,238\n23.2%\n\n2009 \n\n25\n5,125 \n3,875 \n4,625 \n5,500 \n6,500 \n \n7,750 \n8,125 \n8,750 \n94\n2,467\n5.5%\n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n15\n5,894 \n4,456 \n5,319 \n6,325 \n7,475 \n \n8,913 \n9,344 \n10,063 \n100\n0\n0\n\n5\n6,188 \n4,679 \n5,585 \n6,641 \n7,849 \n \n9,358 \n9,811 \n10,566 \n103\n0\n0\n\n5 \n6,498 \n4,913 \n5,864 \n6,973 \n8,241 \n \n9,826 \n10,301 \n11,094 \n104 \n0 \n0 \n\n5\n6,823 \n5,159 \n6,157 \n7,322 \n8,653 \n \n10,317 \n 10,817 \n 11,649 \n104\n0\n0\n\n2014 \n\n10\n7,505 \n5,675 \n6,773 \n8,054 \n9,519 \n \n\n 11,349 \n 11,898 \n 12,813 \n105\n0\n0\n\nIncludes 5% value added tax. \nSimilar increase applied to all the consumers.

Under  Vietnamese  Decree  No.  88/2007/ND-CP  dated  28  May \n2007,  URENCO  is  obligated  to  make  provisions  for  cost  recovery.  There  are  currently  two \nsources of revenue generated through URENCO\u2014one is through an environment fee charged \nand collected by THWSC and another through direct tariff on solid waste collection. It should \nalso  be  noted  that,  while  THWSC  collects  a  5%  environmental  fee  surcharge  based  on  its \nprevailing water tariff, it also keeps 10% of the total revenue collected as service charge and \nsends the remaining 90% to the provincial taxation bureau. The provincial taxation bureau, in \nturn,  will  pay  50%  to  the  National  Environmental  Protection  Fund  and  50%  in  the  form  of  a \nsubsidy to URENCO. Table A11.2 below basically summarizes the required increase. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n5\n\n  \n\n2014 \n\n2013 \n\n2011 \n\n2008 \n\n2010 \n\n2009 \n\nTable A11.2: Recommended Level of Environment Fee Increase  \n2012 \n\nYear \nWW Surcharge as a % of WS Tariff a \nWW Tariff Increase (b) \nDomestic (average) \n  - less than 10 m3 \n  - from 11 m3 to 20 m3 \n  - from 21 m3 to 30 m3 \n  - above 30 m3 \nAdministration \nIndustry \nServices \nCost Recovery (%)  \nm3 = cubic meter, WW = wastewater. \na  Wastewater surcharge is confined to an environment fee implemented in 2005 by Thanh Hoa Province.

THWSC was established as a provincial-level company with \na  mandate  to  provide  water  in  major  urban  areas  of  Thanh  Hoa  Province  (Thanh  Hoa  City, \nSam  Son,  Bim  Son  town,  and  Hoang  Hoa).  The  company  owns  and  operates  three  water \ntreatment  plants,  urban  networks,  and  facilities  related  to  irrigation.  It  has  a  current  water-\nsupply  connection  rate  of  55%  in  the  urban  center.  Its  activities,  besides  managing  water \nsupply  (which  contributed  53.9%  of  its  gross  revenue  in  2007),  include  equipment  sales  and \ninstallation,  construction  services,  hotel  services,  and  consulting.  In  2010  THWSC  plans  to \nchange  its  status  through  a  process  of  equitization  (partial  privatization)  in  line  with  the \ngovernment  initiative  on  management  of  water  supply  companies  wherein  the  private  sector \nwill be encouraged to take up a stake of up to 50%. In reviewing the key financial ratios and \nindicators of THWSC's financial statement, especially its debt service capability, it was found \nthat, after including this loan and after stripping away its non-core businesses, THWSC will not \nhave  sufficient  internal  resources  to  meet  its  debt  service  obligations.  The  company  will \nexperience negative cash flow during the project loan period unless serious efforts are taken to \naddress its O&M and management expenses. Therefore, provincial financial subsidies shall be \nrequired to achieve full cost recovery, as mentioned in Table A11.1. \n\nWastewater  Company.  URENCO  was  established  as  a  public  utility  enterprise  in \n6. \naccordance  with  the  Vietnamese  Government  Decree  88/2007/ND-CP  issued  on  May  28, \n2007.  The  company  currently  implements,  operates,  and  maintains  sewerage  network  and \nditches.  Even  though  URENCO  operates  with  varying  degrees  of  financial  and  operational \nautonomy, its operations largely depend on Thanh Hoa City budget allocations for solid waste, \ndrainage,  wastewater,  and  other  services.  To  reduce  the  need  for  such  dependence,  Thanh \nHoa province and city have emphasized the need to adopt a user-paying principle to recover \ncosts for providing services. However, current investments for drainage (which is traditionally \nconsidered financially unsustainable because of its largely nonrevenue generating nature) and \nwastewater  treatment  are  unlikely  to  be  recovered  under  the  present  tariff  regime.  A  more \ncreative approach by way of a direct and/or indirect surcharge, a city budget subsidy, and/or a \ncombination  thereof  would  be  recommended  in  order  to  meet  basic  cost  recovery.  In  the  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nmeantime, the city budget1 shall be required to meet URENCO\u2019s basic O&M costs. Imposing a \ncity maintenance budget as a financial covenant would be recommended, as would requiring a \nservice agreement between URENCO and Than Hoa  City. Table A11.3 provides the subsidy \nrequirements from Thanh Hoa to meet URENCO\u2019s basic cost recovery: \n\nTable A11.3: Subsidy needed by URENCO for Basic Cost Recoverya \n\nYear \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010  2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013  2014\n\nSubsidy needed for WW and sanitation (D million) \nO&M Subsidy (%) \nO&M = operation and maintenance, URENCO = urban environmental company, WW = wastewater. \na  Subsidy from Thanh Hoa will be required pursuant to Decree 88/2007-NP-CP dated 28 May 2007 requiring cost \nrecovery to cover basic O&M cost and partial contribution to investment in the construction of drainage work. \n\n3,045  2,537  2,571 2,657 \n\n1,459 \n26 \n\n1,590\n26 \n\n104 \n1 \n\n84 \n\n53 \n\n55 \n\n61 \n\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n\nthe  central  and \n\nProvincial  Budget.  The  consolidated  budgets  of  both \n\nlocal \n7. \ngovernments represent about D365,385 billion ($22 billion), of which 75% are maintained with \nthe central Government and 25% disbursed to the province and municipality, city, and district \nlevels.  As  of  2007,  local  taxation  (excluding  oil  revenues,  import  revenues,  and  export \nrevenues) recovered at the local level (province and city taxation bureaus) represented 70% of \nthe total income of the central budget. Only 11 provinces and municipalities contribute to the \nfinancing  of  the  central  budget.  Thanh  Hoa  Province  is  one  of  the  53  provinces  and \nmunicipalities that do not contribute to the financing of the central Government budget, but are \nbeneficiaries of the national equalization system. In 2007, 66% of THP's total income came in \nthe form of subsidies from the central Government. Based on the financial assessment of the \nbudgetary position of THP, and even in the absence of central Government support for these \nnonrevenue generating components of the loan, the province has enough financial capacity to \nmeet the debt service. Fiscal analysis revealed that the charge generated by the project loan \nrepresents  a  mere  0.38%  of  the  province's  total  revenues  over  the  next  10  next  years.  It \nrepresents  1.31%  of  local  revenues,  and  0.54%  of  the  annual  subsidy  received  from  the \ncentral  Government.    As  such,  the  impact  of  this  loan  on  provincial  finances  is  minimal  and \ninsignificant. \n\n8. \nThe  assessment  of  affordability  is  based  on  the  combined  cost  of  water  supply  and \nwastewater  charges  using  the  above  cost-recovery  tariff.  The  monthly  water  and  sanitation \ncharges  to  average  income  households  still  remain  under  the  affordability  level  of  5%  of \nhousehold  income.  For  low-income  households,  the  table  below  shows  that  the  average \nexpenditure on water supply and sanitation services could be higher than 5% in 2010 for low-\nincome  households.  Poor  user  groups  will  suffer  greater  adverse  impacts  from  the  tariff; \ntherefore,  to  achieve  a  domestic  positive  impact  for  those  below  the  poverty  level  and \naffordability of 5%, tariffs have to be adjusted and cross subsidy with other user groups will be \nrequired. For example, the domestic tariff set up in Thanh Hoa for users who consume water \nless than 10 m3 could be increased more gradually than for users who consume more  (Table \nA11.4). \n\n                                                 \n1 A fiscal analysis on the Thanh Hoa City budgetary position reveals that the charge generated by the project loan is \na mere 1.83% of the total revenue of the city over the next 10 next years; 2.13% of its local revenue and 14% of \nthe annual subsidy received from the state government. Other charges assumed to be covered by Thanh Hoa City \ninclude  direct  O&M  for  component  D  (infrastructure  training),  component  E  (tourism  development),  a  subsidy  to \nURENCO  to  cover  road  O&M  component  A,  repayment  of  the  loan  for  sanitation  component  C,  a  portion  of  the \nO&M costs not recovered by environmental fees, the ADB Central Region Project loan, and a solid waste capital \ninvestment project.

The FIRR of the water supply component is estimated based \non  water  tariff  increases  as  outlined  above,  and  THCWS  projections  for  water  supply.  This \ninvestment should contribute to improving the existing distribution network and expanding the \nservice area to urban villages (about 75,000 inhabitants with an average daily consumption of \n70 liters per inhabitant). Based on this analysis, it is expected that the FIRR is 15.3%, which \nwill  be  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  1.5%.  Continued \ninstitutional and financial reforms to improve THWSC will be key to improving the overall ratios \n(Table A11.5). \n\nTable A11.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return on Water Supply \n\nItem \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n\nWater Supply \n15.3 % \n\n10. \nThe sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the model.

As  such,  it  is  recommended  that  the  provincial  project  management  unit \n(PPMU  strictly  adheres  to  the  recommended  tariffs  and  implementation  schedules.  The \nanalysis  further  implies  that  factors  delaying  project  implementation  should  be  proactively \nmanaged to ensure the continued financial viability of the Project.

The  planned  investment  in  the \ndrainage  and  wastewater  treatment  plant  is  expected  to  reduce  flooding  and  remove \nwastewater  from  the  eight  inner  urban  wards;  improve  the  sewage  system  through  the \nconstruction  of  20  km  of  sewage  network    and  construction  and  upgrading  of  wastewater \ntreatment plants with a combined treatment capacity of up to 10,000 m3/day for the city area; \nupgrade existing sewage network and implement additional primary and secondary networks. \nThe FIRR is estimated at 4.2%, which is higher than the WACC of 1.5%. Similarly, sensitivity \nanalysis was performed on wastewater treatment that it is most sensitive to a delay in the tariff \nincrease. The FIRR base case and the three case-sensitive FIRRs are higher than the WACC \nof  1.5%,  and  as  such  the  Project  can  be  considered  financially  viable  (Tables  A11.8  and \nA11.9). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A11.8: Financial Internal Rate of Return for Wastewater Treatment \n\nItem \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nWater Supply Expansion and Upgrading \n4.2 % \n\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n\nItem \n\nWS FIRR \n\nTable A11.9: Sensitivity analysis on Wastewater Treatment \nO&M + 10 % \n4.0 % \n\nCapital Cost + 10 % \n3.4 % \n\nBase Case \n4.2 % \n\nRevenue \u2013 10 % \n3.1 % \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n1. \nIntroduction. The Thanh Hoa City Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development \nProject  (the  Project)  is  an  integrated  development  plan  to  establish  the  City  of  Thanh \nHoa  as  a  competitive,  livable,  and  sustainable  city,  leading  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The Project has five components, namely: (i) road and transport, (ii) water \nsupply, (iii) sanitation, (iv) infrastructure training, and (v) tourism infrastructure. A project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  project  concluded  that  four  of  the  five  project \ncomponents have subprojects that will require land acquisition: (i) the proposed ring belt \nand  peripheral  road  connections  subproject  under  the  road  and  transport  component; \n(ii)  the  wastewater  treatment  pond  subproject  under  the  sanitation  component;  (iii)  the \nsubproject to expand and upgrade the Thanh Hoa Vocational College of Industry under \nthe infrastructure training component; and (iv) the subproject to establish an information \ncentre in Ham Rong Ward and the Le River beautification subproject under the tourism \ninfrastructure component. \n\nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Impacts.  An  estimated  49.5 \n2. \nhectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired by the Project. Almost all land to be \nacquired will be agricultural land (48.1 ha), while the rest will be residential land (0.4 ha) \nand government land (0.9 ha). \n\nA  total  of  734  project  affected  persons  were  identified  through  the  inventory  of \n3. \nlosses  IOL,  of  which  725  are  households  and  nine  are  institutions  and  communes.  An \nestimated  369  households  will  be  severely  affected  by  (i)  loss  of  10%  or  more  of  their \nproductive assets (i.e., paddy land) and/or (ii) relocation of houses (21 households). \n\nTable A12.1: Number of Project Affected Persons \n\nSubprojects \n\nRing Belt and Peripheral Roads  \nWastewater Treatment Pond \nVocational College of Industry \nInformation Center and Le \u2013 River \n\nTotal \n\nLand Acquisition \n(ha) \n14.1  \n20.0 \n7.5 \n7.8 \n49.4 \n\nAffected Persons \n\nInstitutions  Households \n\n4 \n1 \n- \n4 \n9 \n\n326 \n179 \n161  \n59 \n725 \n\nTotal \n330 \n180 \n161 \n  63 \n734 \n\nha = hectare. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n\nlegal  and  policy \n\nLegal  and  Policy  Framework.  The \n\n4. \nfor \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  under  the  Project  is  defined  by  the \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policies.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Borrower\u2019s \nlaws, regulations, and procedures and ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies \nand  requirements  will  prevail,  consistent  with  Decree  No.  131/2006/ND-CP  which \nprovides that in case of \u201cdiscrepancy between any provision in an international treaty on \nofficial  development  assistance,  to  which  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  is  a \nsignatory, and the Vietnamese Law, the provision in the international treaty on ODA shall \ntake precedence\u201d (Article 2, Item 5). \n\nframework \n\n5. \nProject  Objectives,  Compensation,  and  Entitlement  Policy.  The  overall \nobjective of the compensation and entitlement policy for the Project is to ensure that all \npeople affected by the Project will be able to restore their pre-project conditions while the \npoor and vulnerable households will be able to improve their pre-project living standards \nand  income-earning  capacity  through  compensation  for  the  loss  of  physical  and  non-\nphysical  assets  and,  as  required,  other  assistance  and  rehabilitation  measures. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nCompensation  will  be  based  on  the  principle  of  replacement  cost  while  additional \nassistance  in  cash  and  in-kind  will  also  be  provided  depending  on  the  severity  of \nimpacts. Income restoration measures or programs for severely affected and vulnerable \nhouseholds  will  be  designed  and  implemented  in  consultation  with  affected  persons \nduring the updating of the resettlement plan (RP). \n\n6. \nConsultations  and  Disclosure.  Prior  to  the  socioeconomic  surveys  and \ninventory of losses surveys being carried out, the affected persons were informed about \nthe  proposed  Project,  potential  impacts,  RP  preparation  activities,  project  entitlements \n(i.e., compensation payment at replacement cost) and the schedule. Copies of a project \ninformation  sheet  in  Vietnamese  language  were  distributed  to  communes,  wards  and \naffected  persons  in  July  2008.  Meetings  were  also  held  and  will  continue  during  RP \nupdating  in  order  for  affected  persons  to  be  provided  with  additional  information  about \nthe  Project  and  an  opportunity  for  open  discussion  about  resettlement  policies  and \nprocedures. \n\n7. \nEthnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues. All affected households are Kinh. \nThe census identified 112 households that are considered vulnerable households, as the \nhousehold  head  or  members  of  the  household  fell  into  one  or  more  categories  of \nvulnerability:  female-headed  household,  elderly  households,  and  poor  households  as \ndefined by the Ministry of Invalids and Social Affairs. These vulnerable households will \ntake part in income restoration measures and/or programs under the Project. Separate \nmeetings will be held with them during RP updating and implementation to ensure that \ntheir  special  needs  and  concerns  are  identified  and  addressed  and  that  restoration  or \nimprovement of their socioeconomic conditions will be carefully monitored. \n\n8. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  is  the \nThanh  Hoa  Province  (THP)  People\u2019s  Committee  through  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  unit  (PPMU),  with  support  from  the  five  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs).  They  will  draw  support  from  the  Thanh  Hoa  People's  Committee,  commune \npeople\u2019s  committees,  city  resettlement  committee,  and  the  consulting  team  for  the \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan. \n\n9. \nGrievance  Mechanism.  A  well-defined  grievance  redress  and  resolution \nmechanism  will  be  established  to  address  the  grievances  and  complaints  of  affected \npersons  regarding  land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement  in  a  timely  and \nsatisfactory  manner.  Affected  persons  are  entitled  to  lodge  complaints  regarding  any \naspect  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements,  compensation  policy, \nentitlements,  payment  rates,  and  strategies  and  procedures  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation  assistance  programs.  A  four-stage  procedure  for  redress  of  grievances  is \nprovided in the main report. \n\n10.  Monitoring. Regular monitoring will be undertaken by the PPMU and PIUs, and \nthe PPMU will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. Moreover, an external monitor \nwill  also  be  engaged  to  carry  out  its  own  independent  review  and  assessment  of  RP \nupdating  and  implementation.  The  external  monitor  will  be  mobilized  prior  to  DMS \nactivities.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the  PPMU  and  ADB  on  a \nquarterly basis. \n\n11. \n Resettlement  Budget.  The total budget for updating and implementing this RP \nis  $4.8  million.  This  amount  covers  compensation  and  allowances,  design  and \nimplementation of income restoration measures and programs, administration costs, and \ncontingencies. As the cost of land acquisition and resettlement will be funded under the \nloan, in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ntime), a second generation imprest account (SGIA) will be established in the Thanh Hoa \nCity  resettlement  committee  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and \nADB.  Use  of  these  SGIAs  will  be  limited  to  PPMU  providing  funds  for  payments:  (i)  to \naffected persons for land and other assets acquired to facilitate the construction of the \nvarious  components,  (ii)  to  affected  persons  for  resettlement  compensation  and \nallowances as set out in the approved updated RP, (iii) for relocation site development \nand the income restoration program, and (iv) for incremental expenses incurred by the \ncity resettlement committee, necessary for the implementation of the approved updated \nRP. \n\n12. \nA qualified appraiser will be hired during RP updating to carry out a replacement \ncost  survey  for  land  and  non-land  assets.  The  rates  established  by  the  qualified \nappraiser  will  be  used  as  basis  for  compensation  payment  by  the  PPMU  and  city \nresettlement  committee.  The  PPMU  and  city  resettlement  committee,  with  the  help  of \nproject supervision consultants, will set up a system to ensure that channeling of funds is \ndone transparently, efficiently, and effectively, that monitoring is in place, and that timely \nsubmission of resettlement audit reports are met. ADB staff will have the right to conduct \nspot  checks  or  random  checks  of  expenditures  covered  by  the  SGIA.  Financial  and \naudited statements will also be made available to the external monitor. \n\n13. \nImplementation Schedule. The RP will be updated following detailed design. All \nresettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. Land acquisition \nand relocation of affected households cannot commence until the updated RP has been \nreviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  The  PPMU  will  not  allow  construction  activities  in \nspecific sites until all resettlement activities have been satisfactorily completed, agreed-\nupon rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the site is free of all encumbrances. \n\nTable A12.2: Resettlement Schedule \n\nActivity \nRP preparation \nADB approval of draft RP  \nRP updatinga  \nSubmission and ADB approval of updated RP \nImplementation of the approved updated RP  \nInternal monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports) \nExternal monitoring (intermittent) \nStart of civil works (upon completion of RP implementation)b \nADB = Asian Development Bank, RP = resettlement plan \na RP updating may be carried out by component, depending on the completion of detailed design.  \nb Compensation, clearance of land, and relocation of houses completed but income restoration may still be \nongoing. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n\nSchedule \nJune\u2013August 2008 \nAugust 2008 \nJuly 2009\u2013December 2009 \nSeptember 2009\u2013January 2010 \nOctober 2009\u2013July 2010 \nJuly 2009\u2013onwards \nJuly 2009\u2013onwards \nNovember 2009\u2013onwards \n\n14. \nDisclosure  of  Resettlement  Planning  and  Monitoring  Documents.
