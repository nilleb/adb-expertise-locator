The  SIAP2  provides  (i)  project  preparation  support  to  specific  ensuing \ninfrastructure projects included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) current and future country \noperations  business  plans  for  Indonesia;  (ii)  implementation  and  capacity-building  support  to \nspecific  ongoing  ADB-funded  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iii)  knowledge  and  policy  advisory \nsupport in the areas of infrastructure planning and financing, together with program management \nsupport  for  effective  SIAP2  implementation.  As  of  12  February  2020,  three  subprojects  were \napproved for a total amount of $13 million (43% of total SIAP2 funds) and total disbursements \nwas  $0.08  million. 2  The  available  uncommitted  balance  is  $17  million  including  the  ADB \nmanagement fee and foreign exchange reservations.3 \n \n3. \nWater Security. Although the national water security index progressed from 40.9 (over a \nscale of 0\u2013100) in 2013 to 49.8 in 2016, Indonesia remains at risk for water security.4 The country \nis deficient in several dimensions of water security, especially in household water security, urban \nwater security, and resilience to water-related disasters, for which progress has been slow.5 The \nexpansion of the economy requires increasing amounts of water for food and energy production, \nand  industrial  processes.  Yet  environmental  changes  are  already  influencing  the  water  cycle, \ncausing uneven distribution of water supply and water induced disasters.6 \n \n4. \nProvision of raw water supply is unable to cope with growing demand. While Indonesia is \nblessed with an abundance of water resources, rainfall fluctuates by season and is distributed \nunevenly among the regions. Indonesia is urbanizing rapidly, with the percentage of Indonesians \n\n \n\n1  ADB.  2018.

See https://www.adb.org/publications/asian-water-development-outlook-2016. \n\n5   Household water security progressed from 5 (over a scale of 20) in 2013 to 6 in 2016, urban water security from 5.6 \nto 6.3, and resilience to water-related disasters from 3.61 to 4.74.

This will put further \npressure on water resources to cope with population and industrial expansion.7 Water for energy \ndemand will increase by a factor of about eight from 2013 to 2050.8  Agriculture uses 80% of the \nraw  water  and  is  expected  to  feed  an  expanding  population.  While  construction  of  new  dams \nacross the archipelago is a government priority, this will not suffice to fill the gaps in water supply. \nIn 2015, raw water storage capacity was estimated at only 76.4 cubic meters (m3)/capita, far below \nthe 1,975 m3/capita targeted by 2025.9 Existing reservoirs and conveyance systems are operating \nbelow their original capacity due to conflicting water allocation interests and high levels of siltation. \nClimate change is further exacerbating spatial and temporal disparities. The impact of deficient \nwater  supply  is  further  accentuated  by  inefficiencies  at  end  user  level.  Water  utilities  are \nunderperforming  with  high  level  of  non-revenue  water. 10  Environment  flow  in  rivers  is  not \nmaintained at the required level.  \n \n5. \nDistribution  of  water  in  irrigation  networks  suffers  from  losses  due  to  deteriorated \ninfrastructure  and  suboptimal  management.  Unreliable  irrigation  water  supply  is  limiting  yields \nand  cropping  intensity,  and  resulting  in  low  productivity,  rendering  agriculture  less  sustainable \nand resulting in the inability to diversify to high-value crops. This negatively impacts the income \nand well-being of farmers. Also, the national targets of enhanced food security and improved rural \nincomes are not met. Since rice is mainly produced in the irrigated areas, irrigation management \nis important for food security.11 Furthermore, land conversion of irrigation systems in peri urban \narea significantly reduces the potential to increase production.12 Increasingly, widespread water \nshortages mean that Indonesia will rely more on irrigation and efficient water use in agriculture.13 \n \n6. \nIndonesia is highly prone to flooding due to its climate and topography. Flooding, which \noccurs seasonally in most of the country, has been increasing in frequency and intensity due to \nclimate  change  and  land  use  change.  The  floods  disrupt  economic  activities,  accentuate \neconomic  inequalities,  and  disproportionately  affect  women.  During  January\u2013May  2017,                     \n1.5 million people were affected by 490 flood events.14 Damages are estimated to cost $2.3 billion \nannually.15 With  population  growth  and  proximity  to  the  sea,  it  is  projected  that  the  number  of \npeople living in low-elevation coastal zones will rise to 93.7 million by 2060, from 39.3 million in \n2000,  while  the  population  living  in  a  flood  plain  with  a  1  in  100  year  flooding  risk  will  reach            \n14.5 million in 2060 due to sea level rise.16 Scientists estimate that from 2000 to 2030, increases \nin exposure will elevate flood risk by, on average, 76% and 120% for river and coastal floods, \nrespectively.17 Some 20% of rice cultivation is on low lying coastal plains and reclaimed swamps \nand will be at increasing risk of frequent flooding, saline intrusion, and coastal erosion affecting \nlivelihoods and food security.  \n \n\n7  The industrial demand is predicted to double from about 14 cubic meters per second (m3/s) in 2013 to 29 m3/s by \n\n2030.
