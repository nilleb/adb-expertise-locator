The  CPA  component  comprises \ninstallation  of  a  computerized  container  terminal  management \nsystem (CTMS), measures to improve port area water quality, and \nimprovements  to  the  intra-port  roads  and  bridges.  The  CHC \ncomponent  comprises  activation  of  ASYCUDA++  (an  automated \nsystem  for  customs  data  management)  with  connections  to  the \nCTMS, and installation of container scanners needed to meet new \nsecurity  initiatives.  The  RHD  component  is  construction  of  an \naccess-controlled  link  (connector  road)  from  Chittagong  port \naccess  road  to  the  two  container  terminals  at  the  port  of \nChittagong. \n \nUnless  immediate  measures  are  taken  to  lower  the  country\u2019s \nshipping and port costs, which are twice as high as those in some \ntrade  competitiveness  of \nthe \nneighboring  country  ports, \nBangladesh  will  rapidly  diminish.  A  fundamental  source  of  high \ncosts  at  the  port  of  Chittagong  is  container  yard  congestion,  due \npartly \nterminal  management  and  document \nprocessing,  and  limited  road  access.  Additionally,  the  customs \nclearance  process  requires  documents  to  be  manually  moved \nthrough  several  stages  requiring  48  endorsements, \nthereby \nlowering port capacity and encouraging corruption.  \n \nAccidental  spillages  of  oil  and  wastewater  containing  oil  from \nships  occur  frequently  in  the  port  area.  Management  of  such \nincidents  according  to  the  International  Convention  for  the \nPrevention  of  Pollution  from  Ships  (MARPOL  73/78)  requires  an \nimmediate investment in spill cleanup equipment and an oil-waste \ntreatment  facility.  Likewise,  the  port  needs  to  meet  national  and \n\nto  paper-based \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nObjective  \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n \n\ninternational  security  standards,  which  require  the  installation  of \ncontainer scanners. \n \nThe Project will increase the capacity of the container terminal at \nthe  port  of  Chittagong  and  enable  international  port  security  and \nenvironmental  standards  to  be  met.  In  the  medium  term,  the \nProject  will  lead  to  lower  shipping  and  port  charges,  which  will \nfoster more international trade. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $41.3 million \nequivalent.

CPA component will be financed out of its own funds. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  30,600,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. Accordingly, \nADB will finance all foreign exchange costs, amounting to 74.1% \nof  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  all  local \ncurrency  costs,  which  amount  to  25.9%  of  the  total  project  cost. \nADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Government to \nRHD and CHC through budgetary allocations. Amounts allocated \nto  CPA  will  be  subject  to  repayment  to  the  Government  under  a \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable \nto ADB. \n \n1 July 2005 to 1 January 2009 \n \n1 July 2008 \n\nlending \n\n\f \nExecuting Agency \n \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\n \n \n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCPA, CHC, and RHD will serve as the executing agencies (EAs) \nfor the respective components of the Project.  \n \nEach EA will establish a project implementation unit to administer \nthe  component  under  its  jurisdiction.  A  project  coordination \ncommittee  chaired  by \nthe  chairperson,  CPA,  comprising \ncommissioner,  CHC  and  additional  chief  engineer,  RHD,  will \nserve as a channel of communication among the three EAs. The \ncommittee  will meet every 3  months, or more  often if necessary, \nto  review  progress  and  resolve  outstanding  issues  pertaining  to \nthe Project. \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nContracts valued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $2.0 million \nfor  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB). Procurement of civil works in the RHD component, \nand  the  supply  of  goods  for  computerization,  environmental \nprotection,  and  security  will  follow  ICB  procedures  to  encourage \njoint  ventures \ninternational  competitors  and \nparticipation  of \nthrough domestic contractors.  \n \nFive separate international consultancy firms financed by the loan \nwill be recruited by the respective EAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and \ncost-based selection mechanism: \n \nCPA will recruit two firms to: \n(i) \n\ndesign and supervise the construction of the internal road \nsystem and the environmental management facilities; and  \nsupervise  the  procurement  and  implementation  of  the \nCTMS and the management information system.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \nCHC will recruit: \n(i) \n\nto  activate \n\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development on \nin \na  direct  basis \nASYCUDA++ and other on-the-job training to CHC staff as \na sole supplier; and \na  firm  to  supervise  the  procurement  of  scanners  and  on-\nthe-job training on use and maintenance.  \n\nthe  manifest  module \n\n(ii) \n\n \nRHD will recruit a firm to design and supervise the construction of \nthe connector road.  \n \nThe  primary  economic  benefits  would  be  the  lower  overall  costs \ndue  to  shorter  ship  turnaround  and  container  dwell  times.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated to be about 21.6% and \nthe  net present  value is  $61.5 million at a discount  rate of 12.0%.\nThe  Project  will  also  help  increase  Chittagong\u2019s  potential  to  be  a \ngateway port for international trade of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.  \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fInsufficient  capacity  of  EAs  to  attract  and  retain  staff  skilled  in \nautomated  processes  is  the  most  likely,  but  a  minimal,  technical \nrisk.  Technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to  train  existing  staff \nand to formulate a human resource development plan to minimize \nthat potential risk.  \n \nIt is assumed that the growth in traffic, fueled largely by increased \ntrade  and  lower  non-trade  barriers,  will  continue  as  projected. \nMarginal sensitivity of the economic internal rate of return to lower \nthan  projected  traffic  demonstrates  that  economic  risks  are \nminimal. \n \nIt is also assumed that the Government will support the respective \nagencies  in  implementing  the  key  aspects  of  the  port  efficiency \nimprovement  plan,  such  as  relocating  customs  auctioning  and \ncontainer  stuffing  activities  to  off-quay  sites,  needed  to  derive \nlong-term cost reductions.  \n \nADB will finance an advisory TA of $700,000 equivalent on a grant \nbasis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund.  The  TA  will  have  two \ncomponents. A sum of $240,000 will be made available to the first \ncomponent  to  address  hinterland  transportation  issues  at  the \nmacro  level.  The  second  component  ($460,000)  is  targeted \nspecifically  at  the  port  of  Chittagong  to  help  sustain  project \nbenefits in the long term. Both components will be financed from \nthe Japan Special Fund. \n \nThe  first  component  will:  (i) assess  the  performance  of  the  three \nmodes (road, rail, and inland waterways) in the Dhaka-Chittagong \ninstitutional,  operational,  and \ncorridor,  and \ninfrastructure \nthe  efficiency  and \nto \ncompetitiveness  of  the  modes.

The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  implementing  a  port  efficiency  improvement \nplan and developing operational strategies for improving the efficiency of transport and logistics \nin the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \n \n2. \nDriven by strong demand in its main trading partners, Bangladesh\u2019s economy expanded \nat an average annual rate of over 5% in the last 5 years.1 International trade during that period \ngrew at 10% per annum. By 2003, almost 45% of all exports was destined to European Union \nand  over  25%  to  the  United  States  (US),  while  nearly  30%  of  all  imports  originated  in  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India. Almost 85% of exports and 25% of imports were textiles \nor textile materials.  \n \nMore than a third of the nation\u2019s economic activity is presently located within the Dhaka-\n3. \nChittagong corridor, where the bulk of international trade is generated. The corridor is served by \nthree  modes  of  transportation:  road,  rail,  and  inland  waterways,  which  together  carry  about      \n20  million  tonnes  of  freight  annually.  There  are  three  main  ports  in  Bangladesh:  Chittagong,2 \nMongla,3 and Dhaka-Narayanganj (see map). However, 80% of the trade flows through the port \nof  Chittagong,  which  is  also  an  integral  part  of  the  subregional  transport  and  logistics  chain \nconnecting  northeastern  India,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal  to  Europe,  North  America,  and  Southeast \nAsia.  Therefore,  the  efficiency  of  the  transportation  system  in  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor, \nand the port of Chittagong in particular, is vital for sustaining economic growth.  \n\n \n2. \n\nOperational Performance \n\n \nThe port of Chittagong is owned and operated by Chittagong Port Authority (CPA). The \n4. \nGovernment,  through  provisions  in  the  CPA  Ordinance,  oversees  planning,  expenditure,  and \nhuman resource management. CPA\u2019s operating revenues in the last 6 years have grown at an \naverage  annual  rate  of  about  10%,  and  foreign  exchange  earnings  reached  $42.3 million  in \n2003,  constituting  nearly  49%  of  total  revenues.  Customs  operations  at  the  port  are  also  an \nimportant source of revenue, which accounted for nearly 28% of total public revenue in 2002.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Export  receipts  in  the  first  quarter  of  2004  grew  by  16.2%  year  on  year  while  imports  grew  by  20%.  Real  gross \ndomestic product growth is expected to reach 5.7% in FY2003/04 and 6.0% in FY2004/05 (Economist Intelligence \nUnit/ADB Asian Development Outlook 2004).  \n\n2  The  port  facilities  comprise  13  general  cargo  berths  of  which  four  are  used  for  containers,  and  the  Chittagong \ncontainer  terminal  (CCT),  which  comprises  two  berths  with  a  total  length  of  450  meters  (m)  and  a  backup  yard \narea of approximately 20 hectares (ha) (49 acres). There are 5,355 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) yard ground \nslots in the area. \n\n3  The number of ships calling at Mongla fell from 355 in 1998 to 106 in 2003, and revenue decreased by more than \n\n80% between 2002 and 2003 due to the changes in trading patterns and increasing draft restrictions. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n\nContainers  handled  at  Chittagong  in  the  last  10  years  increased  at  an  average  annual \n5. \nrate  of  approximately  15%.  In  2003,  it  handled  over  600,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units \n(TEUs),  and  bulk  cargo  throughput  reached  approximately  21 million  tonnes  (Appendix 2). \nTraffic is expected to reach 43 million tonnes (with a container throughput of 1,678,000 TEUs) \nby  2016.4 Direct  employment  by  CPA  totals  approximately  8,500  persons.  The  port  creates \nadditional employment for 6,200 dockworkers, 5,300 merchant laborers, and 3,000 stevedores. \nThe total annual wages and salaries of the above groups amounted to about 27% of CPA\u2019s total \nrevenue in fiscal year 2002/03.5 The Government has plans to gradually reduce the labor force \nthrough an early retirement program, which began in May 2004, and outsource more activities \nto  privately  owned  off-dock  facilities.  Those  plans  would  allow  the  introduction  of  more \nmechanized cargo handling. \n \nDespite  the  increase  in  throughput  and  overall  performance  in  the  past  8  years, \n6. \nproductivity remains fairly low, and the port has become a serious tangle in the supply chain. In \nAugust  2004,  asset  utilization  averaged  only  184  TEUs  per  berth  per  day  and  port  stay  about \n2.9  days.6 Average  container  dwell  time  at  the  port  has  remained  almost  unchanged  over  the \npast few years at about 18 days compared with  about 10 to 12 days at comparable container \nterminals  in  the  region.  Average  transit  time  by  rail  between  the  port  and  the  inland  container \ndepot (ICD) in Dhaka,7 including port-handling time, is about 30 hours and costs about $250 per \nTEU. However, import containers have to remain at the port for about 2 days on average from \nthe time of arrival before being assigned a slot on a train. In comparison, it costs about $400 per \nTEU  to  transport  by  truck,  but  takes  about  12  hours  for  door-to-door  delivery,  and  mostly  in \nbreak-bulk form. Media reports claim that informal payments to expedite the flow of documents \nthrough  CPA  and  Customs  House  of  Chittagong  (CHC)  are  on  the  rise.  These  delays  and \npayments  contribute  to  the  higher  maritime  cost  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  textile  exports  to  the  US, \ncompared with exports from the People\u2019s Republic of China; India; Taipei, China; and Thailand. \n \n7.  \nAt least one spill of oil or wastewater containing oil occurs in the port area every week. \nConsequently,  water  quality  in  river  Karnaphuli  under  the  jurisdiction  of  CPA  is  low.  The \nconcentration of oil in the water samples taken in the port area was found during the feasibility \nstudy  to  be  between  30  and  338  parts  per million  (ppm).  TA  3357-BAN, 8  through  training \nworkshops and discussions with the Government, produced contingency plans and monitoring \nand training manuals for environmental management. However, the main recommendations of \nthe TA, including procurement of equipment and materials, and training of oil-spill contingency \nteam staff, have not been carried out. \n \nCPA has met the basic requirements specified under the International Shipping and Port \n8. \nSecurity  code.  However,  it  is  yet  to  meet  all  the  requirements  specified  under  the  container \nsecurity initiative launched by US customs in January 2002. This initiative requires measures in \nplace  at  the  originating  port  to  detect  potential  security  breaches  such  as  human  and  drug \n\n                                                 \n4  \"Ports  System  Development  Project:  Master  Plan  and  Trade  Facilitation  Study\".  1998.

The measures include container scanners and automated tools for monitoring export \ncontainers and processing import containers by CHC.  \n \nB. \n \n\n \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nConstraints \n\n \n9. \nContainer dwell times at the port of Chittagong, which have remained high but stable in the \npast 5 years are beginning to rise sharply due to manual operations management and document \nprocessing  methods.  Under  the  manual  methods  now  in  place,  documents  pass  through  many \nstages,  requiring  48  endorsements,  which,  in  addition  to  increasing  dwell  times,  create \nopportunities for corruption. Likewise, the present manual container tracking system unduly delays \ncontainer  movements  in  the  yard.  Without  the  use  of  information  technology  (IT),  berth \nproductivity will further decline and add to shipping costs.  \n \n10. \nEven  with  a  computerized  port  management  system,  certain  customs  processing  rules \nnow  in  force  will  continue  to  limit  port  capacity.  One  example  is  CHC\u2019s  rule  related  to  off-port \ncontainer  freight  stations  (CFSs)  and  ICDs,  which  prevents  newly  constructed  private  CFSs \nfrom  handling  import  containers.  ICD  Dhaka,  the  only  facility  permitted  to  handle  both  import \nand export containers, is poorly connected to the port both by road and rail. Consequently, only \nabout  10%  of  the  import  containers  are  processed  there,  even  though  70%  of  the  import  and \nexport  cargo  either  originates  from  or  terminates  in  Dhaka.  With  the  exception  of  another \napproximately 10% that are handled at nearby facilities, the remaining less than container load \n(LCL)  and  full  container  load  (FCL)  containers  are  unstuffed  in  the  yards,  thereby  requiring \nadditional vehicles to enter the port. Delays on the part of consignees taking delivery of import \ncargoes  and  CHC\u2019s  inefficient  auctioning  rules  on  unclaimed  consignments  also  add  to \ncontainer dwell times. Since the port is already operating at capacity, such rules compound the \nbarriers to trade.  \n \n11. \nThe  Government\u2019s  ratification  of  the  International  Convention  for  the  Prevention  of \nPollution  from  Ships  (MARPOL  73/78)  in  September  2003  can  also  be  expected  to  limit  port \ncapacity  unless  oil-waste  reception  and  treatment  facilities,  and  other  basic  infrastructure  and \nequipment  necessary  for  managing  maritime  waste  are  provided.  Moreover,  no  routine \nmonitoring of concentration of pollutants, including oil and grease, is conducted in the port area. \nUnder MARPOL 73/78, all ports are required to have adequate reception and treatment facilities \nfor  oil  waste  and  noxious  liquid  substances  as  well  as  a  clear  management  plan  for  handling \nother wastes in close coordination with the local government. It also sets out standards for the \nmajor  categories  of  pollution  from  ship  and  port  operations  such  as:  (i) oil,  (ii) noxious  liquid \nsubstances,  (iii) harmful  substances,  (iv) sewage,  and  (v) solid  waste.  Failure  to  comply  with \nthese requirements could result in possible embargoes.  \n\n \n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nAccording  to  a  post  evaluation  conducted  by  ADB  9    the  overall  effectiveness  and \n12. \nsuccess of ADB-funded projects in ports and shipping is reportedly high.  In the first Chittagong \nPort Project in Bangladesh, the recalculated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was higher \nthan at appraisal. The post evaluation report notes that lack of management reporting systems \nfor assessing port operating efficiency is one factor adversely affecting operating performance, \nwhich  this  Project  aims  to  remedy.    In  the  case  of  advisory  TAs,  the  post  evaluation  revealed \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1996. Sector Synthesis of Post-Evaluation Findings in the Ports and Shipping Sector. Manila. \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nthat  institutional  strengthening  of  financial  and  management  reporting  systems  and  data \nprocessing  helped  achieve  some  success,  although  lack  of  staff  qualified  for  training \nconstrained  TA  implementation.  The  advisory  TA  to  CPA  under  this  Project  is  structured  to \nensure  that  a  firm  with  specific  experience  and  broad  understanding  of  related  issues  is \nrecruited to provide consultancy services to compensate for the institutional weaknesses and to \nmaximize  knowledge  transfer.  The  Government  has  provided  specific  assurances  to  assign \nsuitably  qualified  staff  to  be  trained  in  the  operation  and  management  of  the  new  computer \nsystems.  The  implementation  delays  of  past  road  projects  managed  by  the  Roads  and \nHighways  Department  (RHD)  have  been  caused  largely  by  lengthy  government  approval \nprocesses. Such delays will be lessened in future since the Government has introduced shorter \ntime  limits  for  approval  and  revised  public  procurement  rules.  Moreover,  RHD  is  planning  to \naward  more  design-build  contracts,  which  would  speed  up  implementation  by  eliminating  the \ndelays in recruiting separate design consultants. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutlook \n\n \nThe Government has initiated several capital projects at the port of Chittagong under the \n13. \nsixth  Five-Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007).  CPA  has  procured  13  straddle  carriers,  12  reach  stackers, \n22 trailers, six rubber-tired gantries, and other minor container-handling equipment in the last 5 \nyears. Four gantry cranes will be installed at the Chittagong container terminal (CCT) by the end \nof  2005.  A  1,000-meter  container  quay  with  a  capacity  of  500,000  TEUs  (New  Mooring \ncontainer  terminal  or  NMCT),  which  will  be  managed  by  a  private  entity  under  a  concession \nagreement,  is  currently  under  construction.  NMCT  will  be  equipped  with  six  to  eight  gantry \ncranes,  and  have  a  220,000-square  meter  back-up  area.  These  will  help  speed  up  container \nhandling and lower ship turnaround times, which in turn would lead to lower freight rates. \n \n14. \nProcedural  and  operational  solutions  have  been  introduced  to  improve  capacity  and \nthereby  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  exports  and  lower  the  price  of  imports.  Under  a \nproject  financed  by  the  World  Bank 10 ,  a  computerized  customs  management  system \n(ASYCUDA++)  developed  by  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development \n(UNCTAD)  has  been  introduced  at  four  inland  ports,11 port  of  Chittagong,  and  the  National \nBoard  of  Revenue\u2019s  headquarters. CHC  has  shifted  all its  import  groups  into  the customs  hall \nroom  and  under  ASYCUDA++  operations.  ASYCUDA++  modules  cover  most  foreign  trade \nprocedures,  and  can  handle  manifests  and  customs  declarations,  accounting  procedures,  and \ntransit  and  suspense  procedures.  Although  all  modules  are  not  activated,  the  system  permits \nabout 50% of importers to clear cargo within 24 hours. Since 1 June 2004, extra penal rent is \ncharged on containers not cleared within 45 days, which forces importers to expedite clearance. \nAdditionally, a new ICD is being initiated at Narayanganj. These measures in concert will partly \nease container yard congestion in the short term. \n \nThe Government has clearly expressed interest in seeking an immediate solution to the \n15. \npresent  capacity  problem  through  a  transition  from  the  existing  manual,  paper-based \noperational  system  to  a  transparent,  expeditious  IT  system.  In  addition  to  speeding  up \noperations, the IT system would also minimize opportunities for corruption, which takes place in \nthe form of informal payments for expediting document processing or altering cargo manifests. \nMoreover,  given  the  volume  of  time-sensitive  exports  to  the  US  and  increasing  containerized \nimports, the Government is committed to meeting security requirements critical for maintaining \n\n                                                 \n10  Customs Administration Modernization (CAM-1) Project. \n11  ICD Kamalupur, Dhaka, Benapole, and Mongla. \n\n \n\n\fdelivery  schedules.  Better  access  to  the  port  area,  enhanced  internal  circulation,  and \nguaranteed ship operations with minimal environmental impacts are also port sector priorities. \n \n \n\n4. \n\nLinkages to Asian Development Bank Strategy \n\n \n16. \nADB  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  to  assist  transport  sector  development  in \nBangladesh.  Accordingly,  interventions  are  planned  in  different  subsectors  of  transport  to \nimprove  operational  efficiency  and  integrate  the  different  modes.  This  Project  is  part  of  those \ninterventions and is included in the Bangladesh Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u2013\n2006).  It  is  also  the  first  ADB  investment  project  in  the  port  sector  in  over  two  decades  (a \ncomplete list of external assistance to the port subsector in Bangladesh is given in Appendix 3). \nGiven that the port is an integral part of the subregional transport system linking four nations\u2014of \nwhich  various  elements  in  Bhutan, 12 India  (West  Bengal),13 Nepal,14 and  Bangladesh15 were \ndeveloped with ADB assistance\u2014the Project, by increasing the port\u2019s capacity, will serve as a \ncatalyst  for  attracting  a  larger  share  of  transit  traffic  to  and  from  neighboring  countries  to \nChittagong.  Moreover,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  for  railway  sector  development 16  will  help \nincrease the capacity and speed of Dhaka-Chittagong rail services, while the access-controlled \nChittagong  port  access  road,  which  is  already  under  construction  with  ADB  financing17,  will \nprovide a direct link from the Dhaka-Chittagong highway to the port. The expected increase in \nland transport capacity in the corridor due to the rail and road projects will substantially enhance \nport capacity18 and contribute to long-term sustainability of the proposed Project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjective \n\n \nA. \n \nThe objective of this Project is to increase the capacity of the container terminal at the \n17. \nport  of  Chittagong,  and  enable  Bangladesh \ninternational  port  security  and \nenvironmental standards. The resultant reductions in overall shipping and port-handling charges \nwill facilitate international trade and foster economic growth in the long term.  \n \nB. \n \n18. \nsubcomponents. \n \n\nthree  main  components  with  several \n\nThe  Project  will  comprise \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\ninterrelated \n\nto  meet \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2000.

They  include  enhancement  of  personnel  skills, \nintroduction of a strategic plan for cutting costs and increasing port productivity, support for the \npreparation  of  an  anticorruption  strategy,  modernization  of  specific  customs  procedures, \nrevisions to port tariffs, and environmental management in the port as summarized in the port \nefficiency improvement plan (PEIP) in Appendix 4. The relevant agencies have already initiated \ndiscussions on possible improvements. Among the aspects considered are: (i) a new customs \nwarehouse  and  other  facilities  along  the  Bangladesh  Railway  corridor  adjacent  to  the \nChittagong port access road, (ii) a FCL yard in the port park, (iii) an intermodal terminal in close \nproximity to the port park, and (iv) a new CFS facility. To facilitate timely implementation of the \nPEIP, support will be provided under the TA component of the Project.  \n \n\n \n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management  \n\n \n20. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  construction  and  operationalization  of  an  oil-waste \nseparation  plant,  a  laboratory  for  routine  monitoring,  and  implementation  of  a  comprehensive \nenvironmental  management  plan  to  meet  MARPOL  73/78  requirements.  It  is  expected  that \nships  without  onboard  oil-waste  treatment  equipment  calling  at  the  port 19  will  utilize  the \nproposed  facilities  to  dispose  of  oil  waste,  and  enable  CPA  to  meet  Bangladesh\u2019s  effluent \nstandards for oil-related activities.  \n \n21. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  Environmental  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003)  and  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected Infrastructure Development Projects (1993). The summary IEE (Appendix 5) indicates \nthat  there  will  be  no  major  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  and  after  implementation. \nTherefore, no further impact assessment studies are needed. \n \n22. \nTo  address  the  minor,  localized,  and  temporary  impacts,  a  mitigation  and  monitoring \nplan as detailed in the summary IEE has been designed. The plan requires measures in place, \nparticularly, to prevent any soil erosion and vegetation damage and prevent possible spread of, \nand exposure to, potentially hazardous and radioactive materials and waste in the project area.  \n\n                                                 \n19  About 1,700 ocean-going vessels and 4,000 coastal ships called at the port of Chittagong in 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n \n23. \nThe land acquisition and other resettlement impacts of the Project will not be significant. \nHowever, they will affect about 112 people in 19 households, 6 businesses, and 3 community \nbuildings,  which  are  located  on  9.5  hectares  of  land  belonging  to  CPA.  The  affected  persons \n(APs) are mainly informal dwellers who do not have land titles to the property that they currently \noccupy. The removal of APs will trigger resettlement safeguards. All APs are entitled to receive \ncompensation  packages,  elaborated  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the  short  resettlement  plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix A).  During  socioeconomic  surveys  and  consultations,  all  APs \nexpressed their willingness to relocate themselves. Assistance with relocation will be provided \nto them as outlined in Supplementary Appendix A. The plan was translated into Bangla and was \ndisclosed to all APs. It will also be posted on RHD and ADB web sites. The Project will not have \nany impacts on indigenous peoples. Indigenous populations are concentrated in the Hill Districts \nof Chittagong and are not engaged in employment activities associated with the port.   \n \n \n \n24. \nThe US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide grant funds for a detailed \nassessment  of  needs,  including  preparation  of  technical  specifications,  and  training  on  law \nenforcement  and  procurement  of  container  scanners.  The  grant  will  also  enable  recently \ninitiated  technology-based  security  management  measures  of  CPA  and  CHC  to  be  integrated \nwith the scanner system to maximize the utility of the CHC component financed by the Project. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nAs  shown  in  Table  1  and  Appendix 6,  the  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$41.3 million equivalent.

Each EA will establish a project implementation \nunit  to  administer  the  component  under  its  purview.  To  oversee  the  implementation  of  the \nProject as a whole, a coordination committee chaired by the chairperson, CPA, and comprising \nthe commissioner, CHC, and the additional chief engineer, RHD, will be established prior to loan \neffectiveness.  The  coordination  committee  will  serve  as  a  channel  of  communication  and \ncoordination of activities among the three EAs. The committee will meet every 3 months or more \noften, if necessary, to review progress and resolve outstanding issues pertaining to the Project. \n \n\nProject Management \n\n                                                 \n20  Commitment charges form part of interest during construction, shown as separate line items in Table 1. \n\n\fAt the central level, a steering committee chaired by the secretary, Ministry of Shipping, \n29. \nwill review progress and as necessary, provide guidance on implementation. The committee will \nconsist  of  representatives  of  MOC,  National  Board  of  Revenue,  Economic  Relations  Division \nand  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Planning  Commission,  Implementation \nMonitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning, and representatives of the three \nEAs. The steering committee will meet at least every six months or more frequently if necessary. \n \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n3. \n\n \nProcurement  \n\n \n30. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of about 48 months from 2005 to 2008, \nincluding  procurement  and  pre-  and  postconstruction  activities.  The  scheduled  date  of \ncompletion of civil works and equipment installation is July 2008. The proposed timings for the \nvarious components are shown in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n31. \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $500,000  equivalent  for \ngoods  and  $2.0 million  equivalent  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Procurement of civil works on the connector road, and the supply of \ngoods  for  computerization,  environmental  protection,  and  container  scanning  equipment  will \nfollow ICB procedures to encourage participation of international competitors and joint ventures \nthrough domestic contractors. Civil works contracts valued less than $2.0 million equivalent will \nbe  procured  based  on  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Indicative  contract  packages  are \nlisted in Appendix 8. \n \n32. \nIn  view  of  the  significance  and  relationship  of  the  Project  to  ongoing  road  and  port \ndevelopment activities, ADB approved advance procurement action. The advance action, up to \nbut  not  including  the  signing  of  the  contracts,  will  cover  (i) selection  of  consultants, \n(ii) prequalification  of  civil  works  contractors,  and  (ii) tendering  and  evaluation  of  bids  for  civil \nworks  and  supply  of  goods.  Advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \n33. \nCPA  will  recruit  a  firm  of  international  consultants  financed  by  the  loan  to  design  and \nsupervise  the  construction  of  the  internal  road  system  and  the  environmental  management \nfacilities.  Outline  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  the  consultants  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nA  firm  of  international  consultants  financed  by  the  loan  will  be  recruited  by  CPA  to \n34. \nsupervise  the  procurement  and  operationalization  of  the  CTMS  and  MIS.  Outline  TOR  for  the \nconsultants are given in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nUNCTAD will be recruited on a direct selection basis by CHC to implement the manifest \n35. \nmodule of ASYCUDA++ and provide on-the-job training to CHC staff. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are given in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nA  firm  of  international  consultants  financed  by  the  loan  will  be  recruited  by  CHC  to \n36. \nsupervise  the  procurement  of  scanners  and  provision  of  on-the-job  training  customs  officers. \nOutline TOR for the consultants are given in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nRHD will recruit an international consulting firm to design and supervise the construction \n37. \nof  the  connector  road.  Outline  of  TOR  for  the  consultants  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n38. \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection mechanism. \n \n\nThe  recruitment  of  consultants  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n39. \nFor consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works contracts, loan funds \nwill  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n \n \n40.   Each EA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures \nincurred on the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles.  In  addition  to  the  audit  conducted  by  the  Comptroller  and \nAuditor  General,  consolidated  project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  private  sector \nauditors acceptable to ADB. CPA will submit its audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. CHC and RHD will \nsubmit their audited project accounts to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear.  \n \n41. \nThe EAs will prepare and submit to ADB monthly, quarterly, and annual progress reports \non project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. The EAs will \nmonitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  implementation \nschedule,  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  from  the  schedule.  To \nfacilitate postevaluation of the Project, each EA will submit a project completion report to ADB \nwithin 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n42. \nA  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  Project  in \nrelation  to  its  goals,  purposes,  and  outputs  was  agreed  upon  with  the  EAs.  Shortly  before \nimplementation, baseline values will be established for: (i) traffic volumes and vessel turnaround \ntimes;  (ii) port  tariffs  and  transport  charges;  (iii) environmental  indicators; 21 and  (iv) social, \npoverty,  and  economic  indicators.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  computed,  with  the  necessary \nfrequency,  during  project  implementation,  and  2,  4,  and  6  years  after  completion.  Comments \nand findings regarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every alternate quarterly \nreport  to  ADB.  The  project  performance  management  system,  which  will  be  reviewed  and \nrevised during the inception mission, is given in Appendix 9. \n \n43.  Where relevant, social indicators will be disaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys \nwill  be  conducted  and  results  compared  with  the  baseline.  A  final  report  will  consist  of  an \nevaluation  of  changes  that  occurred  in  the  6  preceding  years.  The  construction  supervision \nconsultants  will  assist  the  EAs  carry  out  the  baseline  surveys,  establish  parameters  and  a \n\n                                                 \n21  For this Project, oil and grease content in Karnaphuli river  will be used as an indicator to monitor environmental \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n\fsystem  for  data  collection  and  analysis,  and  prepare  quarterly  performance  reports  during \nimplementation and, subsequently, project completion reports.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n44. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  regular  reviews  of  project  implementation \nincluding a detailed midterm review in January 2007. The midterm review will focus on project \nimpacts, particularly those relating to institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, and \nenvironmental  aspects,  including  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  viability  and \nother  relevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  performance  will  also  be  assessed  during \nthe  review.  The  review  will  also cover  the  implementation  of  the  advisory  TA,  and compliance \nwith assurances in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n45. \nThe  EAs  and  the  Government  will  create  and  sustain  a  corruption-free  environment  in \naccordance with the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, and will follow the policy \nwhen  preparing  all  documents  and  contracts  during  the  bidding  process  and  during \nimplementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  emerging  national  and  local  initiatives  are \nexpected to eliminate opportunities for corruption related to port operations. The Anti-Corruption \nCommission  Bill  2004  has  led  to  the  formation  of  an  independent  commission  that  will \ninvestigate corruption charges and arrange trials by special judges. TA 4140-BAN22 is expected \nto  support  the  operationalization  and  capacity  building  of  that  commission.  Moreover,  the \nNational  Board  of  Revenue  and  the  finance  ministry  have  prepared  draft  regulations  and  the \ncode of conduct for the tax ombudsperson at the port. The ombudsperson will act upon receipt \nof a written allegation of corruption against any tax or customs official. He or she will have the \nauthority to initiate an investigation against any tax or customs official and enter the residence \nor the business establishment of a suspected tax evader. As part of the Project, a port service \nimprovement committee (PSIC) will be established during implementation. With assistance from \nconsultants  recruited  under  the  advisory  TA,  the  PSIC  will  prepare  an  anticorruption  strategy \nthat will include publication of a schedule of port charges and maximum allowable times for the \ncore processes related to shipping and clearing cargo and other port-related activities, such as \npilotage and vessel berthing, as well as procedures for addressing complaints of unscheduled \nor excessive charges.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n46. \nThe advisory TA attached to the loan will have two components. A sum of $240,000 will \nbe  made  available  for  the  first  component  to  address  hinterland  transportation  and  logistics \nissues at the macro level. The second component ($460,000) is targeted specifically at the port \nof Chittagong to ensure the sustainability of project benefits.  \n \n47. \nThe  first  component  is  intended  to  identify  and  design  mechanisms  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of modern logistic chains within the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor involving transport, \ninformation  flows,  and  logistics  terminals.  It  will  develop  a  framework  for  developing  a \ncompetitive  transport  system  where  the  three  modes\u2014road,  railway,  and  inland  waterway \ntransport\u2014are  integrated  and  complement  each  other  to  offer  a  broader  range  of  service \noptions  to  shippers.  To  that  end,  a  team  of  consultants  recruited  by  ADB  will  (i) assess  the \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB.  2003.

The Ministry of  Communications will be the Executing Agency. \nOutline TOR for the consultancy services are given in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n48. \nThe  second  component  is  designed  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  the  PEIP \n(Appendix 4).  A  team  of  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  to  (i) assist  CPA  and  CHC \nimplement the actions according to the milestones in the PEIP, (ii) support the implementation \nof  a  human  resource  development  plan  to  broaden  employee  skills,  (iii) assist  the  Ministry  of \nShipping  and  CPA  implement  the  restructured  port  tariffs,  (iv) assist  CPA  develop  and \nimplement a strategic plan, and (v) help CPA establish and initialize the PSIC. CPA will be the \nEA  for  this  component.  A  committee,  chaired  by  the  chief  of  planning  of  CPA  with  a \nrepresentative  of  the  Commissioner  of  CHC  as  a  member,  will  be  established  to  monitor  and \nguide the work of the consultants. Outline TOR for the consultants are given in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \nADB  will  finance  $700,000  equivalent  of  the  TA  cost  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan \n49. \nSpecial Fund. Two separate teams of domestic and international consultants, to be recruited by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic  consultants,  will  carry  out  the  two \ncomponents.  \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n50. \nTotal benefits derived from the Project principally comprise time-savings on the portside \n(container  shipowners)  and  quayside  (containerized  cargo  owners)  due  to  increased  port \ncapacity. Indeed, those benefits will not be realized unless the complementary measures such \nas the access road, internal circulation system, and scanners are implemented. Moreover, the \ntypes  of  vessels  and  shipping  lines  willing  or  able  to  enter  the  port,  unless  the  international \nmarine  pollution  standards  are  not  met,  will  limit  port  capacity.  Therefore,  analyses  were \nperformed  under  different  scenarios  of  traffic  growth  and  capacity  gains.  Additional  analyses \nwere  performed  to  examine  the  levels  of  economic  risk  under  the  different  scenarios  as \ndescribed in Appendix 10. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated to be 21.6% and \n51. \nthe  net  present  value  is  $61.5 million  (Tk3.6  billion)  at  a  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  To  test  the \nrobustness of the Project, the sensitivity of EIRR to changes in three key variables was tested. It \nshowed that the forecast generated traffic must be less than half the most likely forecast for the \nEIRR to drop below 12%, but in the case of total annual costs and normal traffic, an increase of \nmore than 12% or a drop of more than 11% of the respective most likely estimate is needed for \nthe investment to be nonviable. A risk analysis based on the assumption that the distributions of \nthe above variables are known showed that the 5th percentile of the EIRR is 16.5% and the risk \nof EIRR falling below 12% is zero.  \n \nB. \n \nThe national poverty rate in Bangladesh is 49.8 % (the estimate is based on the upper \n52. \npoverty  line  method  used  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  Household  Income  and \nExpenditure  Survey,  2000),  and  53.1%  and  36.6%,  respectively,  in  rural  and  urban  areas. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n14\n\n \n\n \n\n\fAlthough agriculture is the largest sector, employing about 51% of the country\u2019s total labor force, \nit  is  still  primitive  in  nature.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  economic  growth  required  to  reduce \npoverty  through  expansion  of  foreign  trade  leading  to  greater  utilization  of  national  transport \ncorridors.  The  principal  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  shipowners  in  terms  of  reduced  port \nturnover  times,  and  cargo  owners  will  benefit  from  reduced  container  dwell  times  through \ncomputerization of the terminal management and the resultant expansion of capacity. That will \ncreate  new  employment  opportunities  in  the  port  as  well  as  related  sectors.  Furthermore,  the \nProject  will  also  bring  benefits  to  the  surrounding  communities,  through  increased  port-related \nactivities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is provided in Appendix 11. \n\n \nFinancial Benefits \n\nC. \n \nFinancial projections have been prepared for CPA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n53. \nfor  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  to \nassess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  CPA  component  (Appendix 10).  The \nprojected  financial  statement  indicates  that  financial  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \noperation  and  maintenance  costs  (including  incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the \nProject), income taxes, and debt servicing, and provide a reasonable rate of return. Based on \nthe  financial  projections,  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  113.1  and  an  operating  ratio  of  not \nless than 53% will be achieved over the project life.  \n \n54. \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  CPA  component  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using \nconstant 2004 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation \nand  currency  fluctuations.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  by  evaluating  the \nfinancial  position  of  CPA  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  FIRR  for  the \ncomponent, computed on an after-tax basis, is 18%. This compares with the weighted average \ncost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4%. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate \nthan  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse  conditions.  Based  on  financial  projections  and  the \nfinancial evaluation of the CPA component, the Project is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable.  \n \nD. \n \n55. \nThe  proposed  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  most  technical  and  economic \nrisks  through  detailed  analyses  during  project  preparation,  support  for  project  implementation, \nand assurances from the Government. However, insufficient capacity of CPA and CHC to attract \nand retain staff skilled in IT remains a potential technical risk. Additional support will be provided \nthrough a loan-financed consultancy firm and a grant-financed advisory TA to train existing staff \nand formulate a human resource development plan to minimize that risk in the long run.  \n \n56. \nIt is assumed that growth in traffic will continue as projected. However, container traffic is \nhighly  sensitive  to  external  factors  such  as  a  decline  in  trade  and/or  an  increase  in  nontariff \nbarriers,  which  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  port  agencies.  Regardless,  it  was  found  that  the \nsensitivity of EIRR to traffic is marginal and the economic risks are minimal. \n \n57. \nIt  is  also  assumed  that  the  Government  will  support  the  respective  agencies  in \nimplementing the key aspects of the PEIP, such as relocating customs auctioning and container \nstuffing  activities  to  off-quay  sites,  needed  to  derive  the  long-term  cost  reductions.  TA  is \nprovided to enable the EAs meet those requirements. \n \n\nRisks \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAn analysis of financial performance and projections of CPA (Appendix 10), which as a \n58. \nfinancially autonomous public entity is liable for repayment of the loan component, has shown \nthat  operating  revenues  have  grown  by  more  than  10%  a  year  on  average  over  the  past  6 \nyears. Hence, there is no appreciable risk associated with the lending.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  CPA,  CHC,  and  RHD  have \n\n \nA.   \n \n59. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nCounterpart  Funding.  To  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  the \n60. \nGovernment will provide, in a timely manner, its counterpart funds under the financing plan as \nwell as any additional funds that may be required to complete the Project.  \n \nPort  Efficiency  Improvement  Plan.  CPA  and  CHC  will  take  all  actions  necessary  to \n61. \nincrease container yard capacity, revise port tariffs, improve port performance, develop human \nresources, and improve environmental quality according to the agreed schedule as outlined in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n62.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Prior  to  implementation,  each  EA  will  collect  relevant \nbaseline data required to monitor and evaluate impacts as outlined in the project performance \nmanagement  system  in  Appendix 9.  The  EAs,  with  the  assistance  of  construction  supervision \nconsultants and other experts, will also continue to monitor project impacts with the necessary \nfrequency,  during  project  implementation,  and  2,  4,  and  6  years  after  completion.  During \nimplementation, the EAs will submit semi-annual reports to ADB.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  RHD  will  obtain  site  and  operational \n63. \nclearances  from  the  Department  of  Environment  (DOE)  prior  to  implementation  of  any  civil \nworks  activities.  CPA  will  also  obtain  clearances  prior  to  operationalization  of  the  oil-waste \nseparation  plant.  To  obtain  these  environmental  clearances,  CPA  and  RHD  will  submit  the \nrequirements as described in the Environmental Conservation Act 1995 and the Environmental \nConservation  Rule  1997.  According  to  the  instructions  of  the  DOE,  the  oil  waste  will  meet \neffluent standards for oil refineries without limitations on the amount of water discharged, but will \nmeet the limits on concentration of suspended solids, dissolved oxygenphenol, sulfides, oil, and \ngrease. CPA will obtain input from DOE on the design and implementation of the facilities.  \n \n64. \nCPA and RHD will ensure that environmental mitigation measures described in the IEE \nreports  are  implemented  throughout  project  implementation  and  operation,  and  in  compliance \nwith  the  Bangladesh  Environmental  Conservation  Act  1995  and  other  adopted  environmental \npolicies  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  its  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). \n \nHealth  Risks.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  a \n65. \nrequirement  to  conduct  an  information  and  education  campaign  on  communicable  diseases, \nincluding but not limited to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for construction workers \nas  part  of  the  health  and  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  The \nGovernment will also ensure that the civil works contracts include provisions on health, safety \nand  security,  sanitation  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including  accommodation, \naccidental  death,  dismemberment  and  disability  benefits,  and  clean  drinking  water  for \n\n16\n\n \n\n \n\n\fconstruction  workers  at  campsites  at  standards  acceptable  to  ADB  during  the  construction \nperiod. The Government will also require each of CPA and RHD  to provide to ADB a detailed \nreport on how each of the provisions herein is implemented by the civil works contractors. \n \nResettlement.  The Government will ensure that RHD implement the short resettlement \n66. \nplan in accordance with all applicable government laws and regulations and in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and resettlement framework. This will include \nthe  following:  (i) compensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  cost  together  with  any \nentitlements as stipulated in the short resettlement plan, with ADB\u2019s policy to prevail in the case \nof  any  difference  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations;  (ii) counterpart  funds  and \ndisbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed compensation provided \nto them before any land is taken or civil works contracts are awarded, and the Project will not \nuse any emergency provisions that allow land to be taken in advance of payment; (iv) RHD will \nguarantee  to  meet  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  budget  estimates;  (v) RHD  will \nimplement the Project with adequate supervision, monitoring, and reporting; (vi) a resettlement \nspecialist  within  the  Project  construction  management  consulting  team  will  be  charged  with \nexternal  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement;  (vii) resettlement  fund  disbursements \nand expenditures will be audited annually by an independent auditor; (viii) adequate information \ndissemination  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  be  carried  out;  (ix)  consultations  and \ngrievances  related  to  the  Project  will  be  documented;  (x)  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  if \nthe scope of the Project is changed; and (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB. \n \n67. \nGrievance and Redress Mechanism. The Government will cause RHD to form within 3 \nmonths  of  the  Effective  Date  an  independent  committee  consisting  of  individuals  unrelated  to \nthe  Project  to  hear  any  grievances  or  other  complaints  relating  to  resettlement  or  any  other \nissues arising out of the implementation of the Project. Such a committee will have at least two \nmembers  who  are  women  and  a  member  who  is  a  representative  of  a  nongovernmental \norganization (NGO); one of the women members may be the NGO representative. Local media \nwill be invited to participate as observers and ask questions during meetings of the committee.  \nThe  formation  of  the  committee  will  be  announced  through  the  public  media,  such  as  daily \nBengali newspapers published in Chittagong. The committee will inform the public of its findings \nand recommendations through press releases for the local media within 3 months of the filing of \nany complaint.  In the event a press release is not published in the local media within two weeks \nof  its  release,  the  committee  will  publish  the  press  release  in  the  two  largest  daily  Bengali \nnewspapers published out of Chittagong. \n \nLabor Laws. The Government will cause each of RHD and CPA to ensure that the civil \n68. \nworks contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and regulations and do not employ child \nlabor  in  the  construction  activities.  The  Government  will  cause  each  of  CPA  and  RHD  to  set \nemployment  targets  acceptable  to  ADB  for  women  for  road  construction  activities  and  will \nmonitor progress and cause its contractors to adhere to such targets. The Borrower will ensure \nthat  each  of  CPA  and  RHD  provides  equal  opportunities  for  women  for  road  construction \nactivities, as well as require contractors not to differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork  of  equal  value.  The  Government  through  CPA  or  RHD,  as  the  case  may  be,  will  ensure \nthat  a  specific  clause  to  this  effect  is  included  in  all  relevant  bidding  documents,  and  that \ncompliance is strictly monitored and documented during project implementation.  \n \n69. \nits \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake directly, or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety  in  the  conduct  of  the  Project.  The  Government  will  fully  cooperate  and  will  ensure \n\nAnticorruption.  The  Government  acknowledges \n\nthat  ADB,  consistent  with \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nthat  each  of  CPA,  CHC,  and  RHD  fully  cooperates  with  any  such  investigation  and  each \nextends all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and records as well as \nengagement of independent experts needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations. \nThe Government further acknowledges that all costs related to such investigations will be borne \nby the Project.  \n \n70. \nThe Government will ensure that within 6 months of the date of loan effectiveness, CPA \nwill  establish  a  PSIC,  chaired  by  the  chairperson,  CPA,  to  serve  as  a  forum  for  discussing \nissues  such  as  port  tariffs,  service  quality,  and  development  plans.  PSIC  will  comprise  port \nusers such as shipping agents and owners, freight forwarders, clearing agents, and chambers \nof  commerce.    PSIC  will  establish  procedures  for  receiving  complaints  and  suggestions  from \nport  users  and  the  general  public.    PSIC  will  meet  every  3  months,  and  CPA  will  provide \nminutes  of  all  meetings  to  ADB  within  2  weeks  of  every  meeting.  All  government  accredited \nmembers  of  the  media  will  have  access  to  the  proceedings  and  minutes  of  PSIC  meetings.  \nCPA  will  also,  in  consultation  with  representatives  of  CHC  and  members  of  PSIC,  prepare  an \nanticorruption  strategy  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  will  be  implemented  during  the  remaining \nproject implementation period. \n \n71. \naffected in terms of ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n72. \nof the components of the Project to be completed. \n\nIndigenous  People.

General Overview \n \n1. \nThe transport system of Bangladesh consists of roads, railways, inland waterways, two \nseaports, maritime shipping, and civil aviation, catering to both domestic and international traffic. \nPresently  there  are  about  21,000  kilometers  (km)  of  paved  roads;  2,706  route-kilometers  of \nrailways;  3,800  km  of  perennial  waterways,  which  increase  to  6,000  km  during  the  monsoon, \nand the ports of Mongla and Chittagong; and two international airports (Dhaka and Chittagong) \nand eight domestic airports.  \n \n2. \nDevelopment  and  maintenance  of  transport  infrastructure  are  responsibilities  of  the \npublic  sector  as  is  provision  of  most  rail  and  port  services.  Private  sector  involvement  in  road \nand  inland  water  transport  (IWT)  and  ocean  shipping  has  increased  considerably  in  recent \nyears. It is also gradually entering the domestic air transport and passenger rail markets as well \nas transport logistics. The inland waterway system (IWW) is limited due to geographic factors. \nThe presence of a large number of rivers without high-capacity bridges and the requirement to \nuse  ferries  result  in  the  reliance  on  small  trucks  for  both  intra-  and  interurban  distribution \nservices. The rail and road services are also constrained by network capacity and poor quality \nof  infrastructure.  Inadequate  maintenance  has  led  to  severe  deterioration  of  even  major  road \nand  rail  sections.  Cost  recovery  levels  of  all  modes  are  low  due  to  numerous  regulations  and \nsubsidies. Asset replacement, in particular for the railways, is infrequent and unplanned. Thus, \nservice quality is low and unit costs of transport are high and rising. \n \n3. \nThe  overall  annual  growth  rate  in  the  past  10  years  has  been  nearly  8.2%  for  freight \ntransport and 8.4% for passenger transport. Even then, transport intensity is considerably lower \nthan in many developing countries. There is general recognition that the seaports in Bangladesh \nare  constrained  by  rigid  customs  regulations,  physical  capacity,  and  inadequate  hinterland \ntransport  connectivity.  It  is  manifested  as  congestion  on  the  quays  and  the  long  port-to-door \ndelivery  times.  In  summary,  the  hinterland  transport  system  barely  connects  Dhaka\u2019s  inland \ncontainer depot (ICD) and privately owned container storage depots across the country1 to the \ninternational trading gateways. \n \n \n \n4. \nChittagong  is  the  principal  port,  handling  85%  of  imports  and  80%  of  exports.  It  is \nsituated in the estuary of the Karnaphuli river. The significance of this port is that it provides a \ndeep-water  anchorage  a  few  miles  inland  from  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  port  comprises \nChittagong container terminal (CCT) with two multipurpose (container and general cargo) berths \nspanning 450 meters and two general cargo berths (used mostly by container vessels), and the \ndedicated  general  cargo  terminal  with  11  berths,  some  of  which  are  privately  operated  and \nhandle  only  break-bulk  cargo,2  clinker,  fertilizer,  and  other  bulk  cargo.  The  rededication  of  the \nlater  berths  for  container  handling  is  hardly  possible  under  the  present  high  berth-occupancy \n\nPorts \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n1  Babul, Hadi Hussain. 2003. Key issues for port\u2019s efficiency: development of inland distribution system (road, rail & \n\ninland waterways in Bangladesh. Chittagong.  \n\n2  Break-bulk  cargo  traffic  is  defined  as  all  general  cargo  that  is  not  containerized,  for  instance  in  loose,  palletized, \n\nbagged or in a pre-slung packing form. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nrates.  However,  the  New  Mooring  container  terminal  (NMCT),  which  is  expected  to  be \noperational in early 2006, can more than double the container-handling capacity of the port.  \n \n5. \nThe port of Mongla is situated 85 km inland from the Pussur river entrance, which has a \ndynamic  erosion  and  sedimentation  profile.  Cargo  is  almost  entirely  handled  directly  between \noceangoing vessels and inland river craft at the port's river moorings, which have deeper water \nthan alongside the port's berths. The port has 11 jetties, 7 shades for loading and unloading of \ngoods,  and  8  warehouses.  It  uses 12  swinging  moorings  or  floating  berthing  places  in  deeper \nsections of the river. The port has trade links with most of the major ports of the world, although \nvessels arriving there are mostly from ports in Asia. Mongla has lost a large part of its dynamics \ncompared with Chittagong, largely as a result of its physical constraints, including poor land and \nmaritime  accessibility.  In  the  last  10  years,  Mongla  has  lost  half  of  its  market  share  to \nChittagong,  and  now  handles  only  about  15%  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  seaborne  trade.  At  present, \nabout  400  ships  call  at  the  port  and  it  handles  about  3  million  tonnes  of  imports  and  exports \neach year, of which only a very small part is container cargo. \n \nOperational and institutional constraints at the two ports render import cargo overpriced \n6. \nfor domestic consumers and export commodities less competitive on world markets. To correct \nthat  situation, \n(such  as  paper-based \nmanagement  of  operations  and  port  labor  schemes),  poor  logistics  organization,  and \nnontransparency of transport and port-handling costs have to be addressed immediately. \n \n\ninfrastructure  problems, \n\ninstitutional  constraints \n\n3. \n\nInland Transport \n\n \n\na. \n\nRoads \n\n \n \n \n7. \nThere are five main road transport corridors in Bangladesh: (i) Dhaka-Chittagong, which \nis  the  major  national  freight  route;  (ii) Dhaka-Northwest  region,  which  is  the  second  most \nimportant  freight  route  with  Jamuna  bridge;  (iii) Dhaka-Khulna  region,  a  difficult  transport \ncorridor  with  a  major  ferry  at  Padma;  (iv) Dhaka-Sylhet  region,  mainly  for  transport  of \nconstruction  material  with  Bhairab  bridge;  and  (v) Khulna-Northwest  region,  a  nondeveloped \ncorridor up the west side with a major ferry at Paksey. This latter corridor is Khulna bound for \nMongla port. \n \n8. \nAs  evident  from  Table  A2.1,  road  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  of  inland  freight \ndistribution with a market share of over 70% in terms of tonnage carried. However, apart from \nthe  localized  operations  in  Chittagong  and  Dhaka,  the  amount  of  container  movements  in  the \nnational road network is at present negligible. \n \n9. \nRoad  freight  services  are  offered  almost  exclusively  by  the  private  sector  (98%) \ncomprising  mainly  small  transport  companies.  The  standard  transport  unit  is  a  2-axle  7-tonne \ncapacity truck, with a gross vehicle weight of 12 tonnes. Overloading is a problem especially in \nrelation to semi-bulk products. Larger vehicles used for movement of heavier unit loads such as \ncontainers are not common and are mainly used for local transport or limited intercity operations \nalong the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor. Recently private companies have increased their fleet of \nheavy trucks for carrying containers to and from Chittagong. \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2.1: Inland Transport in Bangladesh\u2014Modal Share \n(%) \n \n\nYear \n\nRail \n\nIWT \n\nRoad \n\nTotal \nTon\u2013km \n(billion) \nFreight \n\n2.6 \n4.8 \n6.3 \n9.0 \n14.5 \n20.3 \n\nTotal \nPass\u2013km \n(billion) \nPasseng\ner \n14.6 \n29.6 \n26.4 \n32.5 \n32.1 \n34.0 \n\n \n\nFreight \n\nPassenger \n\nFreight \n\nPassenger \n\nFreight \n\nPassenger \n\n1974-75 \n1984-85 \n1988-89 \n1992-93 \n1999-00 \n2004-05a \n\n28 \n17 \n11 \n7 \n6 \n7 \n\n30 \n20 \n17 \n12 \n13 \n12 \n\n37 \n35 \n30 \n32 \n20 \n19 \n\n16 \n16 \n15 \n13 \n14 \n14 \n\n35 \n48 \n59 \n61 \n74 \n74 \n\n54 \n64 \n68 \n75 \n73 \n74 \n\nIWT \u2013 inland water transport; Ton\u2013km \u2013 tonne\u2013kilometer; Pass\u2013km \u2013 passenger\u2013kilometer \na Planning Commission forecast. \nSoucre:  Babul,  Hadi  Hussain.  2003.  Key  issues  for  port\u2019s  efficiency:  development  of  inland  distribution  system \n(road, rail & inland waterways in Bangladesh. Chittagong. \n\n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nb. \n\nRail \n\nInland Waterways \n\n \n \n \n10. \nThe  rail  system  is  principally  divided  into  broad  gauge  in  the  west  of  the  country  and \nmeter gauge in the east. The sector has suffered a decline in freight traffic and its market share \nhas  dropped  from  around  30%  to  an  estimated  7%  at  present,  mostly  due  to  the  growth  in \nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, for which road transport can provide a more frequent \nand  reliable  service.  Even  for  bulk  traffic  movements,  obsolete  rail  wagons  and  speed \nrestrictions have made rail increasingly unattractive. These problems are compounded by thefts \nand  the  necessity  for  frequent  safety  checks,  thus  increasing  transit  times  and  congestion  on \nthe dominantly single-track system. As it is, only the Dhaka-Chittagong route is cost-effective for \ninland  distribution.  However,  the  recent  rail  links  of  Rajsahi-Joydevpur  and  Khulna-Joydevpur \nover  Jamuna  bridge  have  opened  up  an  opportunity  to  cater  to  the  rail-borne  traffic  in  the \nnorthern and southern regions of the country. \n \n \n \n11. \nIWW  has  an  important  role  in  transport  due  to  the  large  network.  Both  Chittagong  and \nMongla  ports  are  dependent  on  IWT  for  the  movement  of  bulk  and  semi-bulk  products.  At \nMongla, most of the tonnage handled at the port is distributed by IWT, although there are some \nnavigational  constraints  in  the  IWW  from  Mongla  to  Dhaka-Narayanganj.  While  IWT  has  long \nbeen used for distribution of bulk and break-bulk cargoes, transportation of containers has not \ndeveloped  due  to  the  lack  of  appropriate  river  terminals  in  Dhaka  and  other  freight  centers. \nMoreover, the river is passable only for vessels with a maximum draught of 4 meters. \n \n12. \nAt present, IWT provides services to outer anchorages, and facilitates inland distribution \nof products from specialized terminals\u2014oil, grain, fertilizer, clinker, etc.\u2014and overside working \nof  semi-bulk  vessels  in  the  port.  The  vessels  used  for  IWT  are  mainly  bay-crossing  cargo \nvessels and, despite the fact that intermodal operational arrangements would enable cargoes to \nbe  transported  from  door-to-door,  it  has  not  yet  played  a  major  role  in  the  transport  of \ncontainers. The lack of a dedicated terminal facility at Dhaka is also a major problem. However, \nif  the  necessary  operational  arrangements  are  established,  IWT  could  be  a  real  alternative  to \nroad  and  rail.  A  riverside  container  terminal  is  under  construction  at  Khanpur  by  a  private \ncompany  on  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  basis,  and  a  public  terminal  is  also  being  built  at \nPaangooan.  These  terminals,  both  situated  in  the  Dhaka-Narayanganj  area,  will  have  an \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nestimated  annual  capacity  of  respectively  60,000  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEUs)  and \n120,000 TEUs and could attract a share of over 10% of Chittagong-originated container traffic. \n \n\n4. \n\nDhaka-Chittagong Corridor \n\n \n13. \nThe  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor  contributes  annually  about  30%  to  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP). Demand for transport in the corridor is already exceeding capacity and causing \nmajor delays to passengers and freight. Traffic on Dhaka-Chittagong highway, most of which is \ntwo-lane,  is  about  16,000  vehicles  per  day  (33,000  passenger  car  equivalent  units  [PCUs]).3 \nRail  carries  about  15%  of  the  transport  along  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor,  including \ncontainers  and  bulk  cargo.  It  is  Bangladesh  Railways\u2019  (BR)  most  profitable  freight  segment, \nadding about 22% to annual freight revenues. \n \n14. \nAbout 80% of freight traffic in the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor is moved by trucks, but little \nin  containers.  The  only  ICD  in  the  country  is  in  Dhaka,  but  only  about  10%  of  the  import \ncontainers are handled there although 70% of the import and export cargo either originates from \nor  terminates  in  Dhaka.  Cargo  is  usually  unstuffed  at  the  port  or  the  few  nearby  container \ndepots  and  then  transported  by  small  trucks  in  break-bulk  form.  This  is  not  only  wasteful  in \nterms  of  resources,  as  each  container  is  loaded  in  3-4  trucks,  but  also  defeats  the  economic \nbenefits of containerization. Moreover, cargo is open to more pilfering and damage in transit.  \n \n15. \nCustoms allows containers to be transported to Dhaka ICD by rail under the original bill \nof  lading  and  the  consumers  can  take  delivery  at  the  ICD  or  at  premises  at  their  choice.  The \nservice is hassle free, cheaper than road, and popular. However, BR is currently able to capture \nonly a fraction of the Dhaka-Chittagong traffic (about 43,100 TEUs or less than 10% of the total \nin 2002) due to capacity constraints\u2014line capacity is limited by sections of single track between \nDhaka  and  Chittagong  and  inadequate  wagons.  Services  are  limited  to  two  daily  container-\ntrains  transporting  about  60  TEUs  each.  Consequently,  containers  now  have  to  wait  up  to  10 \ndays to be able to secure a place on trains. It is likely that, in light of such severe congestion, \nthere will not be a substantial increase in rail traffic on these lines until the ADB-financed Rail \nSector Development Project, aimed at establishing a double track for the entire rail line between \nDhaka and Chittagong, is complete in 2009. \n \n16. \nAn  estimated  cost  comparison  of  the  three  freight  haulage  systems  for  container \ntransport  is  shown  in  Table  A2.2.  It  is  clear  that  IWT  is  the  cheapest,  but  even  if  full  costing \nprinciples are used to include environmental and social costs in the analysis, the time cost may \npreclude a shift in the high-value traffic, which is currently moved by road and rail.  \n \n17. \nFollowing the promulgation of guidelines for development of private ICDs by the National \nBoard of Revenue in 1998, investors have constructed 11 ICDs in and around Chittagong with a \ntotal  capacity  of  22,215  TEUs.  Under  the  present  regulations,  private  ICDs  are  used  only  for \nstuffing export and storage of empty containers, but not as container freight stations (CFS) for \nimport  cargo.  In  addition,  restrictions  on  siting  of  private  ICDs  to  20  km  from  the  port  is  also \ndiscouraging potential investors, especially because appropriate land is unavailable within that \narea.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  The typical average daily volume to maintain a level of service of C (average speed 84 km/h during the 30 most \n\ncongested hours per annum) on a similar road with 12% trucks should not exceed 26,000 PCUs. \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nChittagong Port Authority \n\nB. \n \n18. \nThe  port\u2019s  administration  was  first  legalized  with  the  Port  Commissioner\u2019s  Act  of  1887. \nThe Port Commissioners and Port Railway jointly administered the port until July 1960 when it \nwas reorganized as Chittagong Port Trust, thus ending the dual administration of the port by the \ntwo  agencies.  In  order  to  provide  more  autonomy  to  the  port\u2019s  management,  Chittagong  Port \nAuthority (CPA) was established in September 1976 as an organizational unit of the Ministry of \nShipping.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Cost Comparison of the Three Modes of Transport \n($) \n \n\nItem \n\n1.

Chittagong.  \n\n \nPort  management  responsibilities  are  vested  in  a  board  comprising  a  chairperson  and \n19. \nthree  members  who  are  appointed  by  the  Government.  There  is  also  an  advisory  committee \nconsisting of representatives from port users, Bangladesh Navy, customs, Bangladesh National \nRailway (BNR), Inland Water Transport Authority, and Chittagong City Corporation. CPA owns, \nmaintains, and operates all vessel- and cargo-handling facilities in Chittagong. However, there \nis  no  regular  forum  or  channels  of  communication  or  dialogue  among  key  port  users  and  port \nmanagement.  \n \nCPA\u2019s  organization  consists  of  three  divisions  reporting  to  the  chairperson:  operations, \n20. \nengineering, and finance, with a total employment level of 8,489 salaried employees and blue-\ncollar  workers  and  laborers.  In  addition  to  the  three  divisions,  six  departments  report  to  the \nchairperson.  In  terms  of  the  number  of  employees,  the  traffic  department  is  the  largest  with  a \nstaff level of 2,014. While there are over 200 highly qualified technical personnel assigned to the \nengineering,  planning,  and  finance  departments,  low  wage  levels  and  lengthy  procedures  for \nchanging  job  classifications  have  precluded  CPA  from  recruiting  new  staff  with  special  skills. \nHowever, the educational levels and general interest among existing staff make them suitable \ncandidates  to  be  retrained.  Moreover,  staff  have  received  informal  training  and  exposure  to \nmodern  port  management  and  operational  practices,  and  are  genuinely  eager  to  have  new \npractices introduced to the port. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\n21.  With the enactment of the Financial Act of 2000, CPA became a corporate entity entitled \nto  retain  control  of  its  revenues  and  expenses,  and  was  obligated  to  pay  income  taxes  to  the \nGovernment.  In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2000/01,  CPA  paid  income  taxes  of  $5.14  million.  Its  foreign \ncurrency  earnings  in  2002/03  amounted  to  $42.33  million,  which  constituted  49%  of  its  total \nrevenue. \n \nC. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRecent Trends \n\n \n22. \nContainer-handling operations at Chittagong started in 1976/77 when 6 TEUs (all 20-foot \ncontainers)  were  imported.  At  that  time  there  were  no  specialized  facilities  or  equipment  to \nhandle containers. The rapid growth of container traffic has surpassed all expectations, reaching \nin excess of 121,000 TEUs in 1991/92 and more than 560,000 TEUs in 2002/03 (Table A2.3).  \n \n\nTable A2.3: Container Traffic Projections  \n(1,000 TEUs) \n \n\nHigh Growth (9%) \n\nLow Growth (3.2%) \n\nTotal \n560.49 \n578.43 \n596.94 \n616.04 \n635.75 \n656.09 \n677.09 \n698.76 \n721.12 \n744.19 \n768.01 \n792.58 \n817.95 \n844.12 \n871.13 \n899.04 \n927.78 \n957.46 \n\nTotal \n560.49 \n610.93 \n665.92 \n725.85 \n791.18 \n862.38 \n940.00 \n1024.60 \n1116.81 \n1217.32 \n1326.88 \n1446.30 \n1576.47 \n1718.35 \n1873.00 \n2041.57 \n2225.32 \n2425.60 \n\nImport  Export \n281.16 \n279.33 \n306.46 \n304.47 \n334.05 \n331.87 \n364.11 \n361.74 \n396.88 \n394.30 \n432.60 \n429.78 \n471.53 \n468.46 \n513.97 \n510.63 \n560.23 \n556.58 \n610.65 \n606.67 \n665.61 \n661.28 \n725.51 \n720.79 \n790.81 \n785.66 \n861.98 \n856.37 \n939.56 \n933.44 \n1024.12 \n1017.45 \n1116.29 \n1109.03 \n1216.76 \n1208.84 \n\nModerate Growth (6.4%) \nTotal \nImport Export\n560.49 \n281.16 \n279.33 \n596.36 \n299.15 \n297.21 \n634.53 \n318.30 \n316.23 \n675.14 \n338.67 \n336.47 \n718.35 \n360.35 \n358.00 \n764.32 \n383.41 \n380.91 \n813.24 \n407.95 \n405.29 \n865.29 \n434.06 \n431.23 \n920.66 \n461.83 \n458.83 \n979.59 \n491.39 \n488.19 \n1042.28 \n522.84 \n519.44 \n1108.99 \n556.30 \n552.68 \n1179.96 \n591.91 \n588.05 \n1255.48 \n629.79 \n625.69 \n1335.83 \n670.09 \n665.73 \n1421.32 \n712.98 \n708.34 \n1512.29 \n758.61 \n753.67 \n1609.07 \n807.16 \n801.91 \n\n \nYear \nImport  Export\n281.16 \n279.33 \n2002/03 \n290.16 \n288.27 \n2003/04 \n299.44 \n297.49 \n2004/05 \n309.02 \n307.01 \n2005/06 \n318.91 \n316.84 \n2006/07 \n329.12 \n326.98 \n2007/08 \n339.65 \n337.44 \n2008/09 \n350.52 \n348.24 \n2009/10 \n361.74 \n359.38 \n2010/11 \n373.31 \n370.88 \n2011/12 \n385.26 \n382.75 \n2012/13 \n397.59 \n395.00 \n2013/14 \n410.31 \n407.64 \n2014/15 \n423.44 \n420.68 \n2015/16 \n436.99 \n434.14 \n2016/17 \n450.97 \n448.04 \n2017/18 \n465.40 \n462.37 \n2018/19 \n480.30 \n477.17 \n2019/20 \nSource: TA Consultant based on growth rates provided by Chittagong Port Authority (CPA). 2002/03 figures \nrepresent actual traffic. \n \n23. \nDuring  the  first  9  months  of  2003/04  (until the end  of  March  2004)  the  port\u2019s container \ntraffic reached 487,252 TEUs. On an annualized basis, this volume translates to 650,000 TEUs, \na 15.9% increase over 2002/03. \n \n \n24. \nContainers  are  handled  at  the  two  multipurpose  berths  at  jetties  9  through  13  and  at \nCCT. The onshore container-handling system consists of forklift and straddle-carrier systems. At \nthe general cargo berths (GCB), tractor-trailers are used to move containers between the quay \nand  the  yard.  Forklifts  are  used  to  move  containers  in  the  yard.  At  CCT,  the  straddle-carrier \nsystem  is  used  for  both  yard  operations  and  transferring  containers  between  the  quays  and \nyards. \n \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe number of TEUs increased by 14.9% annually during the 12-year period 1991/92 to \n25. \n2002/03. The corresponding increases in tonnes and the number of container ships are 15.5% \nand 6.7% per year, respectively. The lower rate of growth in the number of ships in relation to \nTEUs or tons resulted in a corresponding increase in the average number of TEUs or tons per \nship.  From  1991/92  to  2002/03,  the  average  number  of  TEUs  per  ship  increased  from  388  to \n874 and the average number of tonnes from 3,458 to 8,271.  \n \n26. \nIn terms of TEUs, import/export traffic is nearly balanced. However, in terms of tonnes, \nthe traffic is not balanced with an import/export ratio of approximately 5:2. This is also reflected \nin  the  average  weight  per  TEUs  for  imports  at  13.3  tonnes  and  for  exports  at  5.6  tonnes,  in \n2002/03.  This  disparity  is  due  to  the  large  number  of  export  containers  shipped  empty, \nconfirming that the port is primarily an import port for containerized cargo as in the case of bulk \nand  general  cargoes.  In  2002/03  for  example,  111,051  empty  TEUs  were  exported  (39%  of \nTEUs exports), whereas only 11,404 empty TEUs were imported (4% of TEUs imports). \n \n\n2. \n\nCustoms Interface \n\n \n27. \nThe  customs  operations  are  primarily  paper-based  with  some  computerization  in  the \nform  of  1  of  6  ASYCUDA  modules  running.  From  a  port  operations  perspective,  however,  the \nkey problems relate to customs regulations dealing with the stripping of containers. For security \nreasons, customs requires that all CFS operations take place inside the port area. Customs also \nrequires cleared full container load (FCL) containers to be unstuffed inside the port area. These \nactivities are slowing down operations at CCT due to inadequate space. They occupy from 20% \nto 40% of CCT operating space, depending on the time of day. Two reasons are provided for \nthis practice: first, customs regards the containers themselves as dutiable items and second, a \ncustoms officer is required to observe the cargo as it is removed from the container to see if it \ncontains contraband. The former reason is in contrast to international norms and the second is \nprimarily a result of not having an adequate computerized risk assessment system in place to \ndetermine which containers should be inspected. \n \n28. \nThe container stripping process is slowed further by the archaic system used to handle \ncargo in the warehouse. Cargo is placed in a semi-organized manner on the floor requiring 98 \nclerks to sort everything out. All accounting and inventory control is done by hand. The average \ndwell time in the warehouse is 10 days. The loading of the outbound trucks is also a very slow \nprocess. These operations interfere with the yard movements. \n \nThe practice of stripping both less than container load (LCL) and FCL containers within \n29. \nCCT  contributes  significantly  to  the  18-day  average  dwell  time  that  is  characteristic  of  current \noperations. It also generates delays that reverberate throughout container operations. Yet it is \nan  artificial  contrivance.  In  most  modern  ports  these  operations  are  carried  out  in  off-dock \nfacilities. Even in many ports lacking computerized clearance systems, the boxes move to the \noff-dock facility using internal transit procedures. \n \n30.  While the negative consequences of these customs requirements on the port and CCT \noperations  are  enormous,  Customs  House  of  Chittagong  (CHC)  and  its  central  ministry \n(National Board of Revenue within the Ministry of Finance) are planning to relocate the customs \nwarehouse and auction house to an off-dock site just north of the Port Park. The Port Park in \nitself  is  a  facility  being  constructed  by  CPA  to  handle  CFS  and  some  FCL  containers.  It  is \nexpected to be complete by January 2006. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\n4. \n\n3. \n\nLabor \n\nPort Environmental Management \n\n \n \n31. \nThe  port  is  an  important  contributor  to  employment  in  the  Chittagong  region.  Direct \nemployment  by  the  CPA  totals  approximately  8,500  jobs.  In  addition,  the  port  creates \nemployment  for  6,200  dockworkers,  5,300  merchant  laborers,  and  3,000  stevedoring  workers. \nThere are as many as 23,000 workers involved in different activities in different sections of the \nport. \n \nThere are two areas where unskilled labor is employed: in the operations on the quay, \n32. \nand in the CFS and FCL container stripping operations. The gang sizes for those activities tend \nto  be  excessive:  in  container  loading/unloading  operations  a  gang  includes  about  12  workers \nwhere  only  2  or  3  would  be  needed.  Given  the  low  wages,  this  has  little  impact  on  cost,  but \nefficiency is lowered when too many persons are handling equipment and cargo.  \n \n33.   Recently, CPA and the Government started to gradually reduce the labor force through \nmutually  agreed  retirement  compensation.  The  process  is  very  similar  to  those  conducted  in \nmost  of  the  ports  in  the  world,  where  technological  improvements  in  port  operations  created \nlarge redundancies in both port employees and dockers. Although costly, this has been proving \na  successful  model  for  reducing  long-term  costs  and  improving  productivity.  The  Government \nalso  plans  to  introduce  a  system  of  performance-based  remuneration,  which  will  eliminate  the \nsystem of informal earnings. \n \n \n \nCPA is surrounded by many industrial plants and almost all of them discharge untreated \n34. \nwastes into the Karnaphuli river. In addition, intentional discharging and accidental spillages of \noil and oily substances (e.g., bilge) from ships occur almost weekly. Sometimes, oil pollution in \nthe  river  becomes  noticeable.  However,  due  to  strong  currents,  wind,  and  wave  action  the  oil \ndissipates  fast.  It  reaches  the  riverbanks,  and  stains  the  vegetation  along  the  river.  Although \naround 1,700 ocean ships and 4,000\u20135,000 coastal ships (on average five ocean ships and 15 \ncoastal ships daily in 2003) call on Chittagong now (and will increase in the future), there is no \nroutine  monitoring  of  oil  pollution  within  CPA\u2019s  area  jurisdiction  and  there  is  no  pollution \nmonitoring  along  the  river.  Water  samples  taken  from  the  river  in  March  2004  at  10  different \nsites within CPA\u2019s area jurisdiction have confirmed that the oil and grease content range from \n30\u2013338 parts per million (ppm), exceeding the allowable limits. \n \nThe  existing  government  regulations  have  established  comprehensive  standards  for \n35. \nindustries  to  fight  pollution.  However,  enforcement  is  weak.  In  this  regard,  pressure  due  to \ninternational  requirements  on  environmental  management  is  pushing  individual  industries  to \ninternalize their environmental problems. As for the port sector, the Government has ratified the \nconvention on Marine Pollution (MARPOL) 73/78, which came into effect in September 2003.  \n \n36. \nAt present, CPA is not fully equipped to comply with MARPOL 73/78 in terms of facilities, \nequipment,  or  staff.  MARPOL  73/74  covers  the  1954  Oil  Pollution  Convention  that  requires \ncontracting  parties  to  take  all  appropriate  steps  to  promote  the  provision  of  facilities  for  the \nreception  of  oily  wastewater.  Aside  from  prevention  of  pollution  by  oil,  the  convention  is  also \nintended  to  address  other  forms  of  pollution  from  ships  such  as  (i) noxious  liquid,  (ii) harmful \nsubstances in packaged form, (iii) sewage, (iv) solid wastes, and (v) air pollution. It is, therefore, \nnecessary for CPA to have as a starting point an oily waste reception facility. Having this facility \nwill  force  CPA  to  allocate  resources  for  improving  their  environmental  performance,  which  will \nstrengthen Chittagong port\u2019s competitiveness.  \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n5. \n\nContainer Traffic Projections \n\n \n \n \n37. \nCPA  recently  prepared  cargo  throughput  projections  for  container  traffic  as  well  as  for \nother cargoes. They are based on alternative levels of high, moderate, and low annual growth \nrate  assumptions  of  9%,  6.4%,  and  3.2%,  respectively.  Considering  the  annual  14.9%  growth \nrate  of  container  traffic  expressed  in  TEUs  during  the  last  12  years,  these  growth  rates \nrepresent realistic trends, even if a reduction in exports will follow the expiration of the Multifiber \nArrangement  at  the end  of  2004.  Besides,  the economy  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  average  of \nabout  5%,  and  if  the  rule-of-thumb  estimate  of  twice  the  GDP  growth  is  used,  the  9%  growth \nseems  realistic.  The  growth  rate  experienced  in  the  last  12  years  is  well  above  average  for  a \nport of its size and is indicative of the changing pattern of the nation\u2019s foreign trade.  \n \n38. \nBased on the assumed growth rates, Table A2.3 shows the projected TEUs for the 15-\nyear  period  from  2003/04  to  2019/20.  Under  the  high  growth  rate  assumption,  the  port  is \nexpected to handle 2.4 million TEUs in 2019/20. In the case of moderate and low growth rates, \nthe corresponding figures are 1.6 million and 957,000 TEUs, respectively. \n\nFigure A2.1: Traffic Growth Forecast \n\nHigh\n\nModerate\n\nLow\n\n3\n0\n-\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n-\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n-\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n-\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n-\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n-\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n-\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n-\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n-\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n-\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n-\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n-\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n-\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n-\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n-\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n-\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n-\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\n-\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\nYear\n\nHigh Growth\n\nModerate Growth\n\nLow Growth\n\nOpportunities for Improving Port Sector Efficiency \n\n \nD.  \n \n39. \nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  been  progressively  implementing  a  number  of \ninstitutional  reforms  and  operational  improvements  intended  to  improve  port  sector  efficiency. \nPrivate sector participation in port-related activities has substantially evolved and now includes: \n(i) operation  of  specialized  cargo  terminals;  (ii) operation  of  warehouses;  (iii) construction  and \noperation of 11 CFSs and ICDs in and around the port of Chittagong and a major (IWT bound) \nICD  near  Dhaka,  at  present  under  construction;  (iv) fuel  storage  facilities  and  tank  farms; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ns\nU\nE\nT\nd\nn\na\ns\nu\no\nh\nT\n\n3,000\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\n(v) ownership  and  operation  of  container-handling  equipment;  (vi) dry  docking  and  ship  repair \nfacilities; (vii) pilotage; and (viii) river dredging operations. \n \n40. \nSeveral  public  investments  are  also  currently  under  way  or  in  preparation  to  improve \ntransport  infrastructure  on  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  corridor.  These  are:  (i) the  ADB-financed \ndouble-tracking  of  the  Dhaka-Chittagong  rail  corridor  to  increase  capacity  and  speed  of  rail \nservices;  (ii) the  ADB-financed  Chittagong  Port  Access  Road,  which  will  provide  a  direct  link \nbetween  Dhaka-Chittagong  highway  and  the  port;  (iii) the  planned  widening  of  the  two-lane \nDhaka-Chittagong national highway to a four-lane facility, of which the initial 28 km have been \ncompleted; and (iv) the construction of two new ICDs\u2014one public and one private under a BOT \ncontract\u2014at Dhaka-Narayanganj to serve IWT of containers.  \n \n41. \nmodernization requirements: \n \n\nCPA  has  also  started  an  important  program  of  public  investment  to  meet  its \n\nA  new  1,000-meter  container  quay  (NMCT)  with  a  capacity  of  500,000  TEUs  is \nunder  construction  with  completion  date  set  for  2006.  NMCT  will  be  equipped \nwith six to eight gantry cranes and a 220,000 square meter back-up area. These \nwill  help  increase  the  speed  of  container  handling  and  lower  ship  turnaround \ntime, which will in turn lead to lower freight rates.  \n\nFour  gantry  cranes  are  being  procured  for  CTC,  and  will  be  operational  by  the \nend of 2005. Current efficiency levels at CTC are very poor. Throughput per ship \nday in container operations is a low 178 boxes, and average turnaround time of \nvessels  is  4.8  days,  including  a  service  time  of  3.2  days.  These  indicators  are \nexpected to improve substantially with the entry into service of the new cranes. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nA  total  of  13  straddle  carriers,  12  reach  stackers,  22  trailers,  6  rubber  tired \ngantries  and  other  minor  container-handling  equipment  have  been  mobilized  in \nthe last 5 years. \n\n \n42. \nA private firm will operate the NMCT under a concession contract. This will be the first \nprivately operated container terminal in Bangladesh. CPA expects the operator to establish high \nproductivity targets, which will have a general positive impact on CCT operations. Competition \nbetween  private-operated  NMCT  and  CPA-operated  CCT  will  raise  the  need  to  guarantee \ntransparency  and  fair  practices.  Improved  efficiency  will  also  have  an  impact  on  labor \nproductivity, thus paving the way for labor union rationalization. \n \n43. \nUnder  the  Customs  Administration  Modernization  (CAM-1),  CHC  has  shifted  all  its \nimport groups into the customs hall room and under ASYCUDA++ operations. Although certain \nsystem modules are not activated to reap the full benefits of computerization, 50% of importers \ncan now clear cargo within 24 hours after (CAM-1) project, while others may take 2 to 3 days.  \n \n44. \nTo  realize  the  full  potential  of  the  planned  physical  and  technological  enhancements, \nother procedural and organizational changes are needed. They include the development of the \nworkforce,  modernization  of  selected  customs  procedures,  reform  to  port  tariffs,  and \nimprovements  to  port  environmental  management.  Activities  ongoing  in  that  regard  are \nsummarized in Table A2.4. \n \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAction Taken \nDiscussions between CPA and CHC about \nrelocating customs warehouse and auction \nhouse \nConstruction of the Port Park \n\nMinistry of Shipping plan to rationalize labor \nunions \nReview of port tariffs \nCreation of the national anticorruption \ncommittee \n\nTable A2.4: Government Initiatives to Facilitate Trade \n\nIncrease container terminal capacity \n\nPurpose \n\nRelocate CFS and FCL activities to increase \ncontainer terminal capacity \nIncrease labor productivity \n\nEnable better billing using CTMS \nInvestigate and penalize guilty parties  \n\nCFS \u2013 container freight station, CHC \u2013 Customs House of Chittagong, CPA \u2013 Chittagong Port Authority,  \nCTMS \u2013 container terminal management system, FCL- full container load  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nADB  \nLoans: \n143 BAN (SF) \n\n144 BAN  \n \n \nTAs: \nTA 96 BAN \nTA 2863 BAN \nTA 4136 BAN \n\nJBIC \n\nWorld Bank \nTAs: \nIDA 622 (TA-III) \nIDA 872 (TA-III) \nIDA 1124 (TA-IV) \nIDA-2393 (TA-VI) \n \nLoans: \nIDA Credit # 424  \n\nIDA Credit #1247 \n\nIDA Credit #1504-2 BD \n(Supplemental) \n\nFrance (Credit) \n(Bangladesh French \nFinancial Protocol) : \n\nFinland (Grants) \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PORT SECTOR \n\n \n\nSource               \n\n \nProject Name \n\nLoan/TA Amount \n(in funding agency \ncurrency, million) \n\n \nDate Approved \n\n \n \n\n \n \nImprovement and rehabilitation of \nrailway track within port area. \nConstruction of one warehouse and \nrehabilitation of 5 transit sheds \nbehind jetties 1-6. \n \nChittagong Port Project \nPorts Upgrading Project \nChittagong Port Trade Facilitation \nProject (CPTFP) \nProcurement of telecommunications \nequipment  \n \n \nPort Development Project  \nPort Development Project  \nPort Development Project  \nPort system development plan : trade \nfacilitation study and master plan.  \n \nCrude oil landing system \n\nConstruction of 2 multipurpose berths \nand procurement of cargo-handling \nequipment \n \nConstruction of 2 multipurpose berths \nand procurement of cargo-handling \nequipment \nProcurement of one trailing suction \nhopper dredger  \n(i) Financial Protocol\u20141983 \n(ii) Financial Protocol\u20141987 \n(iii) Financial Protocol\u20141989 \n\nConstruction of 2 multipurpose berths \nand procurement of cargo-handling \nequipment: \n\n- \n\ninterim container-handling \nequipment  \n\n-  Moheshkhal  bridge  \n5 weighbridges \n- \n\n$ 3.20 \n\n$ 3.60 \n\n \n$ 0.16 \n$ 0.29 \n$ 0.50 \n\n\u00a530.0 \n\n \n \n$ 0.50  \n$ 0.95  \nSDR 0.03 \n$ 0.98  \n\n \n$ 1.60 \n\nSDR 33.00 \n\nSDR 6.32  \n\n \n \nFF   47.40 \nFF   93.00 \nFF     7.05 \nFF  147.45 \n\n \n \n \nFIM 71.41 \n \nFIM  0.89 \nFIM  3.60 \n\n \n \n18 Oct 1973 \n\n18 Oct 1973 \n\n \n1973 \nMay 1998 \n16 Mar 2004 \n \n11 May 1976 \n \n \n \n1979 \n1979 \n1983 \n21 May 1992 \n \n \n10 Aug 973 \n \n \n13 Feb 1981 \n \n21 May 1982 \n \n\n25 Jul 1984 \n \n\n \n \n7 May 1983 \n \n2 Jun 1987 \n \n12 Jun 1991 \n \n \n25 Aug 1984 \n \n \n19 Feb 1988 \n \n21 Sep 1989 \n \n\nContinued on next page \n\nIDA Credit #1096  \n\nTrial dredging in river Karnaphuli  \n\n$ 4.23 \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nSource               \n\n \nProject Name \n\nNetherlands (Grants) \n \n \n\n \nDenmark (Loan) \n\n \n\n1.Procurement of one High Powered \nTug (3200 BHP) \n2.

Based on \nthese  physical  interventions,  the  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Based  on  the \nEnvironmental Conservation Rules (ECR) 1997, the road component is categorized as an \u201cAmber A \nor B\u201d project, while the oil-waste separation plant has no categorization under the ECR. However, \nsite  clearance  and  environmental  clearance  to  operate  the  plant  need  to  be  obtained  from  the \nDepartment of Environment (DOE). On these bases, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared from January to June 2004, but the detailed engineering drawings are yet to be prepared. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n \nThe details of Project activities are summarized in Table A5.1 below: \n\n2. \n\n \nTable A5.1: Summary of Project Activities \n \n\nProject Component \n\nDetailed Activities \n\n1  Road linking CCT and NMCT with \n\n\u2022  Construction of 1.7 kilometers of new road \n\nCPAR \nInternal roads and bridges \n\n2 \n\nwith  a 960-meter flyover \n\n\u2022  Construction of a 900-meter service road \n\u2022  Construction of 2 bridges: (i) 55-meter \n\nbridge over Mohesh Khal, and (ii) bridge on \nthe PSR \n\n3  Waste-oil separator and building \n\n\u2022  Construction of pontoon moorings at the \n\n(around 1,500 square meters) \ncomprising laboratory, office space, \nand storage room for oil-spill \nclearance equipment \n\noil-waste reception facilities \n\n\u2022  Installation of oil-waste separator  \n\u2022  Construction of building \n\nCCT  =  Chittagong  container  terminal,  CPAR  =  Chittagong  Port  Access  Road,  NMCT  =  New  Mooring  container \nterminal, PSR = Port Service Road, \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\nDescription of the Environment \n \n1. \n \n3. \nThe city of Chittagong and surrounding areas, including the project site, are coastal areas. \nThese  areas  are  mainly  plain  land  at  an  elevation  of  about  3\u20134  meters  above  sea  level.  Cyclonic \nstorms  frequently  hit  this  coastal  region  during  monsoon  periods.  The  soil  condition  in  the  project \narea is stable with no erosion problems and groundwater can be found at 3\u20135 meter depths. Deep \ntubewell water is fresh and free from salinity, but the shallow underground water is susceptible to \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nseawater  intrusion  due  to  its  proximity  to  the  bay  of  Bengal.  The  area  of  the  proposed  physical \nworks is considered to be within a seismic risk zone.  \n \n4. \nThe  Chittagong  port  area  is  located  on  the  banks  of  Karnaphuli  estuary,  and  is  a  nursing \nground for many species of fish and varieties of marine life. The river is favorable for migratory fish. \nHowever,  the  water  quality  and  fish  population  have  been  drastically  lowered.  Many  polluting \nindustries  discharge  untreated  effluent  directly  into  the  river.  Untreated  city  sewage  together  with \nmany other wastes such as storm run-off and wastewater from various ships and port activities go \ndirectly into the river, causing frequent localized pollution. In addition, oil spills from ships occur at \nleast  once  a  week.  The  movement  of  the  migratory  fish  in  the  river  has  declined  also  due  to \ninterference from seagoing vessels, port activity, construction of the Kaptai dam, reclamation, and \nconstruction of large-scale fertilizer industries, etc., in the coastal areas. \n \n5. \nThe project area does not have any forests, though within a 10-kilometer (km) radius of the \nproject site, a small patch of mangroves comprising a mainly new plantation of kewra can be found. \nThere is no endangered wildlife reported in the project area, but a large number of  different birds \nare seen in the mangrove forest. The nearest forest area is in Sitakhunda thana (fortress), which is \napproximately 30 km away from the project area. \n\nSociocultural Aspects  \n\n \n2. \n \n6. \nThe project site lies in Bandar thana of Chittagong district. This thana covers an area of 44.6 \nsquare  kilometers  (km2)  with  30,726  households  and  a  population  of  187,739.  The  population \ndensity  is  4,207/km2.  The  people  of  this  thana  are  engaged  in  different  types  of  activities  for \nlivelihood.  Nearly  5%  of  the  population  is  engaged  in  agriculture,  53%  in  services,  12%  in \ncommerce,  and  3  %  in  nonagricultural  labor.  The  productivity  of  the  industries  and  means  of \nlivelihood  are  favorable  so  the  general  economic  condition  of  the  people  is  good.  Nearly  3,000\u2013\n4,000 people are engaged in fishing in the Karnaphuli river and the estuarine areas. \n \n7. \nThe  major  sources  of  drinking  water  are  tap,  tubewells,  and  dug  wells  followed  by  ponds \nand rivers. Most of the households of the Bandar colony (77% of total households) use tap water, \nwhereas 87% of households in Madhya Halishahar and 74% of households in Dakshin Halishahar \nuse tubewell water for drinking. About 50% of the total households in the project area use sanitary \nlatrine facilities, 47% use nonsanitary latrines, while 3% use open places for defecation. \n \n8. \nsurrounding the Project. \n\nThere  are  no  historical,  cultural,  or  archaeological  places  of  importance  in  the  areas \n\nD. \n\n \nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nNo  environmental  impacts  are  expected  in  association  with  the  siting  or  location  of  the \n9. \nProject  because  it  is  located  within  the  existing  port  jurisdiction  and  not  in  the  coastal  area. \nHowever,  the  construction  of  the  road  from  CPAR  to  CCT  will  involve  an  area  that  is  now \nencroached by local communities. The resettlement plan to handle this matter has been prepared \nseparately.  \n\n \nThe  environmental \n\nimpacts  associated  with \n\n10. \nto \nconstruction works. The impacts will include: (i) loss of tress due to land clearing, (ii) disruption of \ntraffic  in  the  construction  area  and  main  road  of  Chittagong  port  area  due  to  the  movement  of \nconstruction  equipment  and  vehicles,  (iii) increased  air  pollution  due  to  increasing  dust  from  the \nearth work, (iv) noise and vibration, and (v) disruption of water system due to construction. All these \n\nthe  road  component  mostly  relate \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n39\n\nimpacts  will  occur  only  during  the  construction  period.  The  mitigation  measures  to  deal  with  the \nimpacts associated with the construction phase include: (i) rerouting traffic with clear signs and by \nmoving  equipment  and  vehicles  as  much  as  possible  by  rail,  (ii) maintaining  optimum  moisture \ncontent during handling of soil, and spraying adequate water to minimize dust, (iii) strictly controlling \nthe  construction  works  that  create  noise  and  vibration  by  prohibiting  night  work,  (iv) pumping \nstagnant  water  and  providing  an  adequate  drainage  system,  and  (v) locating  storage  areas  for \nconstruction materials away from water bodies and river banks. These mitigation requirements will \nbe included in the contract documents for the contractors. Clearly, these impacts are temporary and \nmanageable.  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  and  Chittagong  Port  Authority  (CPA)  will \nimplement these mitigation measures for each activity under their responsibility.  \n\n \n11. \nThe  camps  for  construction  workers  will  be  placed  in  areas  to  avoid  social  conflict. \nFurthermore, the camps will be provided with adequate sanitation and waste management facilities \nto  avoid  disruption  to  the  communities.  Construction  material  that  contains  hazardous  and  toxic \nsubstances  such  as  petroleum  and  lubricants  will  be  stored  in  proper  places  and  managed  in \naccordance with government standards.  \n\n \n12. \nThe environmental impact associated with the operation of the road component is expected \nto be positive, because the new road is expected to ease traffic movement and it will lead to lower \nvehicle  emissions.  The  potential  negative  impact  is  leakage  and  spillage  of  hazardous  goods \ntransported by truck. CPA and RHD will work with other relevant government agencies as well as \nthe  community  to  develop  a  safety  plan.    A  separate  plan  will  be  prepared  by  RHD  and  CPA  to \nreduce  traffic  pollution  and  noise  by  minimizing  the  exit/entry  points  from  the  port  (gates)  and \nchanneling traffic to the Chittagong Port Access Road.  \n\n \n13. \nThe  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  oil-waste  separation  plant  will  be  very \nminimal, and will be confined within CPA\u2019s jurisdictional area. However, since the location of this is \nonly about 100 meters from the main road connecting Chittagong city to the airport, it is expected \nthat traffic congestion will worsen during the construction period. Therefore, adequate traffic signs \nand rerouting of traffic may be necessary. The environmental impacts associated with the operation \nof the plant will be positive. The waste oil from ships will be received and treated at the plant, and \neffluent  discharged  from  the  plant  will  be  designed  to  meet the  Bangladesh  standards  for  effluent \nfrom oil-related activities. This is expected to eliminate the  impact of ships on the water quality in \nKarnaphuli. Moreover, the oil separated from the wastewater could be sold in the open market. In \nthis context, the supervision consultant for this subproject component will also undertake a study of \nthe potential uses for the oil and sludge derived from the separator. The sludge is not expected to \nbe  significant  in  volume  terms  and  is  also  expected  not  to  have  any  oil  substances.  However, \nroutine  tests  on  the  quality  of  sludge  will  be  carried  out  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  oil  and  toxic \nsubstances,  and  therefore  the  sludge  can  be  disposed  of  at  the  municipal  disposal  sites.  The \nsludge  will  be  collected  in  drums  and  stored  in  the  plant  area  in  special  ways  to  avoid  leaks  and \nspills.  \n\nE. \n\n \nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n \n \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during \n\nInstitutional Framework and Responsibility \n\n1. \n\n14. \nthe \nresponsibility of the contractors. An environmental engineer, hired as part of the consultant team for \nimplementing  the  Project,  will  assist  RHD  and  CPA  to  prepare  contractual  documentation  so  that \nthe  bidding  documents,  bills  of  quantity,  and  other  obligations  of  the  contractors  clearly  identify \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  The  environmental \n\nthe  construction  stage  will  be \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 5 \n\nengineer  will  also  assist  RHD  and  CPA  to  monitor  and  supervise  the  contractor  in  implementing \nmitigation measures. CPA and RHD will be responsible for implementing the overall environmental \nmonitoring and management plan as part of the IEE for the oil-separation/treatment facility and the \nconnector road, respectively. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n\n2. \n \n15. \nThe IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will be part \nof  the  mitigation  of  the  adverse  impacts.  Detailed  location  and  timing  to  undertake  the  monitoring \nwork  are  also  identified.  For  the  road  subcomponent,  during  the  construction  phase,  RHD\u2019s  and \nCPA\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  will  focus  on  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  to \nminimize dust, noise, stagnant water, and contamination from activities of temporary worker camps, \naccidents,  and  traffic  disturbances.  During  operation  of  the  oil-waste  separation/treatment  facility, \nenvironmental monitoring will focus on water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, oil \nand grease, and sulfides. Ten monitoring sites have been identified.     \n\n \nCPA  will  prepare  an  annual  report  on  implementing  the  monitoring  and  management  plan \n16. \nand  submit  it  to  ADB  and  relevant  government  agencies.  Similarly,  RHD  will  prepare  an  annual \nreport on the implementation of the environmental management plan for its project component and \nsubmit it to ADB and other relevant institutions. \n\n  \n3. \n \n\nPublic Consultation \n\n17.   During the IEE study, in July 2004, consultations were held with the local communities. The \nconsultations focused on providing information related to the Project and seeking the community\u2019s \nconcerns. There were no public objections raised to the Project during the consultations.  \n\nF. \n\n \nFindings and Recommendations \n \n18. \nThe IEE shows that environmental impacts associated with the physical interventions under \nthe proposed Project are manageable and can be mitigated. Therefore, a full EIA to assess further \nimpacts is not required. However, continuous monitoring will be required and further support to CPA \nto formulate a comprehensive environmental management is necessary.  \n\nG. \n\n \nConclusion \n \nThe  Project  will  not  cause  significant  environmental  problems  and  the  potential  adverse \n19. \nimpacts  are  manageable.  However,  continued  monitoring  of  implementation  activities  should  be \ncarried out. \n\n\fSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN BY PROJECT COMPONENTS  \n(million) \n\nTable A6.1:  Chittagong Port Authority Component \n\n \n\n       Total Cost       Foreign Exchange           Local                         ADB                                     Government  \n                                                                       Currency                       ($)                                                ($) \n        $ \n\n    LC  Total\n\n   Total \n\n      LC \n\n      FX \n\n     Tk \n\n       $ \n\n    Tk \n\n   FX \n\n   Tk \n\n$ \n\n \n\n  b.

\n \nThe economic analysis1 is based on container traffic forecasts under different scenarios. \n1. \nForecasts for \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d were made for the period from 2005 to 2020. \nSince the Project is expected to be implemented starting 2006, the analysis period of 15 years \nis  considered  from  2006  to  2020.  Under  the  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  conditions,  it  is  assumed  that  the \nmoderate growth scenario of the recent Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) forecast would be the \nlikely growth rate. This scenario assumes a compound annual growth rate of 6.4%. Under the \n\u201cwithout  Project\u201d  case,  the  average  compound  annual  growth  is  assumed  to  be  2.6%.  The \nresulting forecasts for both \u201cwithout Project\u201d and \u201cwith Project\u201d assumptions are summarized in \nAppendix 2 (para. 36 and 37).  \n\nThe  following  parameters  and  general  assumptions  were  also  used  in  the  economic \n\n2. \nassessment: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nNumeraire.  For  all  quantifiable  project  costs  and  benefits,  the  unit  of  account \nused is the domestic price level expressed in local currency (Taka). \n\nPrice  level.  The  price  level  used  for  all  project  costs  and  benefits  is  constant \n2004 prices. \n\nSERF and other factors. The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.05, and \nshadow  wage  rate  factors  for  skilled/unskilled  labor  (SWRF)  of  0.87/0.67  were \nused based on loan projects approved in 2002.2 The corresponding value for the \nshadow  conversion  factor  (SCF)  when  the  13%  value-added  tax  (VAT)  rate  is \napplied  becomes  0.91,  in  comparison  to  the  0.83  average  of  the  2002  loan \nprojects.  These  values  were  found  to  be  reasonable  also  due  to  the  marginal \nsensitivity  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  net  present  value \n(NPV) in the present case to both SERF and SWRFs. A 20% increase in SERF \nto  1.26  lowered  EIRR  from  21.6%  to  20.9%.  Likewise,  an  increase  in SWRF  of \nskilled labor to 1.0 lowered EIRR to 21.4%. \n\n3. \nProject  Costs.  The  project  resource  statement  (PRS)  expressed  in  domestic  prices  in \nmillion takas is presented in Table A10.1. The PRS consists of the project costs (including initial \ncapital and annual fixed and variable operating costs) and benefits. Conversion of initial capital \ncosts expressed in nominal financial terms to economic costs is detailed in Table A10.2.

Although  the  cranes  and  the  CTMS  are  separate  investments, \nthe  full  benefits  of  the  investment  in  cranes  will  not  be  derived  without  the  computer  system. \nTherefore, the cost of the cranes is not included in the total project cost, but as described below, \nthe  benefits  from  the  cranes  are  computed  as  reduction  in  ship  turnaround  times.  Indeed,  the \nreduction in turnaround times is assumed to be less if the Project is not implemented. \n                                                 \n1  Performed  according  to  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  1997.

With the CTMS, with better access and circulation roads, and with faster \n5. \ncustoms processing, two principal benefit streams are created. One accrues to ship owners due to \nthe  anticipated  reduction  in  vessel  turnaround  time  (less  waiting  for  loading  and  unloading).  The \nother accrues to cargo owners (shippers and consignees) due to the lowering of capital costs tied \nup in inventories or idle cargo. The benefits fall into two categories: normal traffic and incremental \ntraffic.  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-1  details  the  estimated  benefits  to  ship owners.  Despite \nthe gantry cranes, the vessel discharge/load rate without the Project is assumed to increase only to \n14 TEUs per hour because congestion is likely to worsen. With the Project, this rate is assumed to \nincrease from 15 TEUs per hour in 2006 when the trial operations are expected to commence, to 20 \nTEUs by 2013. The rate is expected to remain steady until 2020 due to the limitations in vessel size \n(maximum 1,200 TEUs) that can be expected to call at Chittagong. \n\nThe operating cost of those vessels is around $10,000 per day. Using this daily rate and the \n6. \nestimated  reduction  in  port  time  at  the  above  load/discharge  rate,  the  shipowner  benefits  were \nestimated as detailed Supplementary Appendix I Table I-1. For normal traffic, the net benefit under \nwith-project assumptions is the difference between the total vessel costs in without-project and with-\nproject  conditions.  For  the  incremental  traffic,  it  is  assumed  to  be  one  half  of  the  savings, \nrepresenting the consumer surplus.  \n \n7. \nThe  benefits  accruing  from  lower  average  container  dwell  time  is  computed  for  two  main \ncategories  of  cargo:  garments  and  other  (nontextile).  In  the  case  of  garments,  the  average  value \nper  TEUs  is  assumed  to  be  $80,000  according  to  CPA  statistics.  The  average  value  of  cargo  for \nother  containers  is  assumed  to  be  $50,000.  Assuming  an  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%,  a \nreduction of the average dwell time of 1 day represents a benefit of $26.30 for the opportunity cost \nof  working  capital  for  the  exporter.  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-2  shows  the  detailed \nestimates of benefits associated with the Project for the cargo owners. \n \n8. \nand the EIRR is 21.6%.  \n \n9. \nRisk and Sensitivity Analysis. Financial and economic risks of port projects stem largely \nfrom uncertain traffic and project costs. To estimate the economic risk induced by traffic variations, \nthe  model  @RISK  was  used  assuming  normally  distributed  traffic  forecasts  to  derive  vessel  and \ncargo owner benefits. The total project cost was assumed to follow a triangular distribution, with the \nestimated  cost  as  the  mean  with  the  lower  bound  and  upper  bound  set  at  90%  and  110%  of  the \nmean. Accordingly, NPV can be expected to lie between $10.1 million and $79.2 million, while EIRR \nwill range from 16% to 23%. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the economic risk of the \nProject is zero. \n\nAs shown in Table A10.1, the NPV of the Project at a discount rate of 12% is Tk3.6 billion \n\n \n\n10. \nCPA\u2019s traffic is largely captive since Mongla, the other seaport, cannot serve containerized \nexports  and  imports  either  due  to  lack  of  hinterland  and  infrastructure  or  geographic  location. \nTherefore,  traffic  projections  are  unlikely  to  vary  significantly.  The  switching  value  of  53%  for \nincremental  traffic  as  shown  in  Table  A10.3  suggests  that  the  likelihood  of  the  Project  becoming \ninfeasible is negligible. Costs, on the other hand, may vary from the estimates at appraisal, but the \nlikelihood  of  the  variation  exceeding  10%  of  estimated  costs  or  benefits  (which  are  based  on \nexpected normal traffic) being 12% less (switching values shown in Table A10.3) is negligible.  \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Indicators and Switching Values \n\nReference Value \n(%) \n\nChange By \n(%) \n\nRevised \nEIRR \n(%) \n \n12.8 \n13.5 \n\n15.3 \n\nSwitching \nValue \n        (%) \n \n11.2 \n12.4 \n\n53.1 \n\n \n10 \n10 \n\n30 \n\nParameter \nEIRR \nUser Benefits \nCosts \nIncremental \nTraffic \n\n21.6 \n \n \n\n \n\nEIRR \u2013 economic internal rate of return \nSource(s): Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Management, Organization, Accounting, and Audit \n\n \n \n11. \nAccording  to  the  provisions  of  the  ordinance,  CPA  is  a  body  incorporated  as  a  perpetual \ngoing-concern. The fund of CPA is to be utilized to the charges in connection with CPA\u2019s functions \nincluding  payment  of  development  expenses,  salaries  and  other \nunder \nremunerations to the port employees.  \n\nthe  Ordinance \n\n12.  While  CPA  has  considerable  independence  under  the  ordinance  in  day-to-day  operations, \nthe  overall  planning  and  financial  control  is  exercised  by  the  Government  through  budgetary \ncontrols  or  the  Ordinance  provisions  which  allow  the  Government\u2019s  intervention.  Major  capital \nexpenditures and their financing must be approved by the Government. Recruitment of employees \nis also required to be cleared by the Government. Tariffs in the ports are set and revised by CPA, \nsubject to the approval of the Government. \n\n \n13. \nCPA  maintains  its  accounts  as  prescribed  by  the  Government.  In  some  respects,  its \naccounting is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For the analysis of \ntheir  financial  performances,  some  adjustments  have  been  made  on  their  financial  statements  to \nmake them in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (details of the adjustments \nmade  are  provided  below).  The  financial  statements  are  prepared  annually  and  submitted  to  the \nGovernment. They are required to be audited by external auditors.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance  \n\n \n14. \nAs  shown  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-3,  turnover  on  fixed  assets  has \nincreased and return on fixed assets has improved over the years because of dwindling size of net \nfixed  assets.  Owing  to  these  factors,  a  huge  amount  of  internally-generated  surplus  funds  is \naccumulated.  The  accumulated  funds  are  deposited  mostly  in  public  sector  banks  and  in  part  in \ncommercial banks under the direction of the Government. The funds created from CPA\u2019s income is \neffectively  beyond  the  control  of  CPA  since  the Government\u2019s  prior  approval  is  required  for  major \ncapital  expenditures.  To  accelerate  replacement  of  aging  assets  and  to  upstream  the  capital \ninvestments needed for upgrading the ports\u2019 facilities, CPA needs to be given financial autonomy to \nhave direct control over internally-generated resources.  \n\n \n15. \nTable I-3. Operating revenues have grown by more than 10% a year on average. This high increase \n\nThe  past  financial  performance  of  CPA  is  summarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I      \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55\n\nwas due to the same high growth in export and import in Bangladesh for the period. In comparison, \nthe growth of operating expenses was no higher than 6% a year on average since staff costs have \nbeen well under control. Consequently, the operating ratio has decreased from 63% in 1998 to 55% \nin  2003.  Return  on  equity  has  remained  at  the  level  of  12-16%,  which  can  be  considered  a \nsatisfactory level.  \n\n \n16. \nCPA\u2019s  high  profitability  is  attributed  in  part  to  high  interest  income  from  bank  deposits. \nInterest income amounts to 50% of total operating income. CPA holds a large sum of accumulated \nsurplus earnings in the form of bank deposits. As of 30 June 2003, such bank deposits amount to \naround  60%  of  CPA\u2019s  total  assets.  The  deposits  generate  a  fixed  interest  income  that  increases \nearnings, which is accumulated again. Because of this huge amount of surplus cash and low level \nof  external  debt,  debt-service  ratio  is  very  high  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I  Table  I-3. \nConsequently, financial ratios related debt-service, or capital structure are not so critical for analysis \nof financial performance. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Forecasts  \n\n17. \nThe  financial  forecast  takes  into  account:  (i)  past  performance;  (ii)  estimated  capital  and \noperating expenses; (iii) forecast growth in traffic; and (iv) projected level of fixed asset investment. \nThe financial projections are summarized in Supplementary Appendix I Table I-3. \n \n18. \nOperating income is expected to grow about 10% a year on average. For the past 6 years, \nthe yearly normal fixed asset replacement rate has been around 6-7%. For the projection, the asset \nreplacement rate of 9% was assumed, considering CPA\u2019s capital investment plan. This increase in \nfixed assets resulted in increase in depreciation and increase in operating expense. Consequently, \noperating ratio will grow to 57% in the next 3 years from 2004 to 2006, and fall thereafter to 53%. \nFor  the  same  reason,  turnover  on  fixed  assets  will  fall,  and  return  on  fixed  assets  will  deteriorate \nduring  that  period.  But  they  will  bounce  back  thereafter.  Return  on  equity  will  remain  at  the \nreasonable  level  of  13%.  Debt-service  ratio  will  remain  high  despite  the  loan  resulting  from  the \nProject because CPA has paid back almost all external debts by 2003.  \n \n19. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was estimated using a \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project \ncomparison. The major assumptions are: (i) FIRR reflects constant 2004 prices, (ii) the capital costs \ninclude  all  incremental  capital  expenditures  associated  with  the  proposed  investment  program \nincluding price contingency and interest charges during construction, (iii) projections for incremental \nport  revenue  streams  were  based  on  the  forecast  of  incremental  traffic  with  gantry  cranes  and \ncomputer systems, (iv) current tariffs are maintained, and (v) revenue and cost streams are over a \n15 year-period with a 10% residual value. The expenditure components of the analysis include the \ninitial capital cost, and recurrent annual operation and maintenance costs. \n\nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  calculated  as  4%  in  line  with  the  minimum \n20. \nrequirement  as  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.  The  FIRR  is  calculated  as  18%,  which  demonstrates  the \nfinancial viability of the Project. \n\n  \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe Chittagong port, being the main port of Bangladesh, provides an important link between international \nmaritime  transportation,  coastal  shipping  services,  and  national  transport  corridors  (road  and  rail)  to  all \nparts of the country. It also has the potential to provide transit facilities to neighboring countries, namely \nBhutan, Nepal, and the eastern part of India. The port carries nearly 80% of the total seaborne exports and \nimports of the country. The development of the port has vast prospects of further increase in foreign trade, \nleading to economic growth with special emphasis on industrialization and development of services. This \nwill in turn generate new employment opportunities leading to a decrease in the national poverty rate. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nBangladesh  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  of  the  world,  where  poverty  is  widespread  and  particularly \nsevere in the rural and remote areas of the country. The national poverty rate is 49.8 % (the estimate is \nbased  on  upper  poverty  line  method  used  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS)  Household \nIncome and Expenditure Survey, 2000) and this is 53.1% and 36.6%, respectively, in the rural and urban \nareas  of  the  country.  Though  agriculture  is  the  major  sector  of  country  employing  about  51%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s total labor force, it is still primitive in nature. Unless the absorptive capacity of the workforce is \nincreased in other sectors of the economy, the poverty situation will not improve. So, rapid development of \nsome sectors, especially transport and communication, trade, and business and industry is necessary to \ncope with the existing situation.  \n \nThe  Project,  located  in  Chittagong,  is  positioned  to  generate  multisector  impacts.  The  Government  of \nBangladesh has recently declared Chittagong as the business capital of the country due to its contribution \nto exports and imports and other general business of the country. Chittagong is also the second largest \nindustrial city. The Government is further planning to declare the Dhaka-Chittagong highway as the new \n\u201ceconomic corridor\u201d in which case the port will be its lifeline. This will also give a big boost to agricultural \ngrowth, given the agro-ecological conditions of Chittagong. A rapid decline in the poverty ratio will require \na  rapid  growth  in  employment  and  livelihoods  in  the  nonagriculture  sector.  With  Sangu  natural  gas  and \nother natural resources in Chittagong, the region has the potential for expanding its rural and small-scale \nindustries, as well as medium and large industries, to enrich the existing industrial base of the area. \n \nThe  Chittagong  Port  Trade  Facilitation Project  will  contribute  to  the  economic  growth  required  to  reduce \npoverty through expansion of foreign trade, leading to optimum utilization of national transport corridors of \nthe country. The principal project benefits will accrue to the ship owners in terms of reduced port turnover \ntime,  and  cargo  owners  will  benefit  from  reduced  container  dwell  time.  The  Project  will  also  improve \nefficiency and effectiveness of port management as well as expand the capacity of cargo handling. It will \nalso create new employment opportunities in the port as well as related sectors of the country. Proposed \ndevelopment  of  the  port  will  improve  the  road  and  railway  network  of  the  country  to  promote  regional \nintegration and a more equitable distribution of benefits. Improved management and expansion of different \nfacilities  in  the  port  in  the  long  run  will  result  in  increased  volume  of  the  country\u2019s  trade,  and  freight \ncharges,  with  benefits  to  all  sectors  of  society.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  also  bring  benefits  to \nsurrounding communities, through increased port-related activities.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57\n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nAs  part  of  the  project  social  analysis  and  labor  issues,  in-depth  consultation  meetings  were  carried  out \namong port officials, labor and trade union leaders, and other stakeholders of the Project. The focus of the \nconsultation meetings mainly included social appraisal, analysis of alternative options, and other relevant \nissues. During consultation meetings, the representatives of different port stakeholders took active interest \nand  participated  in  discussions  with  regard  to  existing  port  scenarios  relating  to  different  labor  issues \nincluding efficiency of labor/workers and productivity of the Chittagong port. Queries and apprehensions of \nthe  participants  were  answered;  the  participants  were  also  consulted  to  assess  perceived  problems  and \nprospects  in  particular  to  the  port  issues.  The  consultation  interviews  were  conducted  using  multiple \nqualitative  research  techniques  such  as  group  discussions,  key  informant  consultation,  and  participatory \nobservations following a checklist of issues. A total of 16 consultation meetings were conducted. \n \nThe  consultation  meetings  were  organized  to  ensure  wider  input  from  both  the  primary  and \nsecstakeholders  on  various  social  dimensions  and  project  impacts  so  as  to  develop  a  comprehensive \nperspective  on  the  Project.  Stakeholder  consultations  and  community-based  impact  assessment  were \ncarried  out  to  (i) develop  a  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  port  workers  and  laborers  and/or  community \nimpacts resulting from the Project; (ii) establish a dialogue with beneficiaries/stakeholders and provide an \nopportunity  for  them  to  understand  the  Project  and  its  potential  beneficial  impacts  on  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  of  the  country;  and  (iii) enable  mitigation  of  the  negative  impacts  of  the  Project  where \nrequired. Community consultations and public participation processes will continue during implementation \nof the Project. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  proposed  project  works  will  not  have  any  adverse  impacts  on  women.  The  consultation  process \nshowed that people (both men and women) were in favor of the Project. They know that the improvement \nof  the  port  will  improve  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  the  people  as  a  whole.  In  fact,  in  the  port  few \nwomen work in the CPA office and the project will have no impact on them. But the executing agencies \n(EA) will address gender issues for women workers to be employed in construction-related activities and in \ncivil  works  construction  contracts.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  wage \ndifferentials between men and women, and that adequate health and sanitation facilities are available to \nwomen workers. Furthermore, contractors will be required not to discriminate against the employment of \nwomen in project works.  \n \nGenerally, there is a lack of awareness and knowledge of communicable diseases among the workers of \nconstruction-related  activities.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  each  civil  contract  will  include  provisions  for \npromoting awareness and preventing the spread of communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted \ndiseases  and  HIV/AIDS.  The  supervision  consultants  will  monitor  contractors\u2019  performance  of  these \nresponsibilities. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nE.

There \nwill  be  no  land  acquisition  cost  since  the  land  is \nalready  under  the  control  of  the  Port  of  Chittagong \n(POC).  Despite \nthe  development \nthe  above, \ninterventions  will  affect  some  19  households,  6 \nbusinesses,  and  3  different  types  of  community \nestablishments. The total number of affected people \nis  112.  All  the  affected  establishments  except  the \npetrol pump are informal settlers. The owners of the \naffected structures will be compensated, based on a \nshort  resettlement  plan,  for  their  losses.  During \nsurvey  and  consultation  meetings,  they  expressed \ntheir  willingness  to  relocate  themselves  with  all \nentitlements  paid.  The  short  resettlement  plan \ncontains  details  about  the  impact  and  entitlement \nmatrix  and  guidelines \nthe  general \nprinciples of the Asian Development Bank policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. \nWith  the  construction  of  internal  and  service  roads \nof  the  port,  including  flyover  to  connect  the  port \naccess  road,  the  port  networks  will  be  integrated \nwith the national network Furthermore, the proposed \ndevelopment  of  the  port  will  improve  the  road  and \nrailway  network  of  the  country  to  promote  regional \nintegration  and  more  equitable  distribution  of \nbenefits. In addition, the Project will bring benefits to \nsurrounding  communities,  through  increased  port-\nrelated  activities.  As  a  result,  it  will  lead  to  overall \nsocioeconomic development of the country, creating \nadditional employment opportunities. \nThe  Project  may  have  some  negative  impacts  on \nthe  employees  of  the  port  due  to  modernization  of \nport  activities.  In  this  regard,  the  port\u2019s  main  labor \nsupply  organization  (DWMB)  has  an  existing  plan \nfor a skill development training program for unskilled \nworkers  to  cope  with  the  situation.  In  addition,  in \norder  to  reduce  overstaffing,  POC  has  recently \nimplemented  a  \u201cgolden  handshake  program\u201d  to \nreduce  the  excess  workforce,  under  which  1,042 \nold-aged  and  disabled  workers  were  retired  in  May  \n2004.  CPA  also  has  a  strategy  to  restrict  new \nrecruitment  to  preclude  further  growth  of  staff. \nFurthermore,  the  Project  has  prepared  a  social \nanalysis report on the port laborer issues. \n\n\f \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerab-\nilities \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\namong \n\nimplement \n\nactivities.

The major proportion of such indigenous \npopulation  is  concentrated  in  the  Hill  Districts  of \nChittagong.  None  was  found  working  or  related  to \nport \nthe \nstakeholders  of  the  port  revealed  that  they  would \nnot  suffer  any  negative  impact  as  a  result  of  the \nProject.  On  the  contrary,  the  development  of  the \nport  was  viewed  as  a  channel  of  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  and  growth  in  the  region.  Port  road \nconnections with the national road network would be \nbeneficial  for  indigenous  people  as  it  will  open  up \nalternative options of employment for them and will \nalso indirectly increase their sources of income. \nThe  most  significant  risk  is  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity  of  the  EA  to  conduct  social  assessment \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank \nand \nsafeguard \ninvoluntary \nresettlement.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  in  the \ndesign  of  the  short  resettlement  plan,  by  requiring \nsocial  assessment  and \nrehabilitation \nprogram to be implemented by third parties such as \nnongovernment organizations. The other likely risks \nand vulnerabilities are as follows: \n \nThe  development  of  the  port  might  raise  certain \ncritical  social  and  health  issues  such  as  increasing \nexposure  of  women  to  the  sex  trade  and  the  issue \nof  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  sexually \ntransmitted diseases. \n \nThe  EA  is  largely  unaware  of  Asian  Development \nBank  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  which \nraises  concern  with  regard  to  their  capacity  to \nimplement the social aspects of the Project.  \n \n\nparticularly \n\npolicies, \n\nincome \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 November 2004) \n", " \n", "        Tk1.00 \n", "Currency Unit \n", "\u2013 \n               = \n= \n", "$1.00 \n", "taka (Tk) \n   $0.0169 \nTk59.30 \n", "The exchange rate of the taka is determined under a floating exchange rate system.
