Indonesia  continues  to  face  the  dual  challenges  of  low  water \nsupply  coverage  and  poor  service  quality.  At  the  end  of  the  last  medium-term  development \nprogram  in 2009,  only  48%  of  the total  population  had access to a  sustainable source  of  safe \nwater,  and  only  about  26%  had  access  to  piped  water.1 Following  the  current  trajectory,  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  will  fall  short  of  reaching  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG) \ntarget of halving the proportion of those without access to safe drinking water sources by 2015.2 \n\n3. \nThe development need is heightened by the combination of rapid urbanization and aging \ninfrastructure.  The  urban  population  has  more  than  doubled,  from  56  million  in  1990  to \napproximately  122  million  in  2010.3 Most  public  utilities,  especially  water  companies,  are  not \nequipped to handle such drastic growth in urbanization. The proportion of the urban population \nserved  by  piped  water  actually  decreased  from  36%  in  1998  to  31%  in  2008  (footnote  1). \nJakarta,  the  largest  city  and  capital,  anchors  an  extended  urban  region4 with  a  population  of \nmore than 28 million, which is expected to grow to 35 million by 2020. However, Jakarta\u2019s water \nsupply  network,  originally  built  during  the  Dutch  occupation,  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  city's \naccelerated growth. Less than 65% of Jakarta's residents currently have access to piped water. \nThe  remaining  urban  population  depends  on  individual  wells,  small-scale  providers,  or  water \nvendors;  often  at  high  cost.  The  urban  poor  make  up  only  10%\u201315%  of  those  with  access  to \npiped  water  and  remain  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  lack  of  access  to  safe  water  because of  \nE. coli contamination of wells and groundwater, a main alternate water supply.5  \n\nAccording  to  Ministry  of  Public  Works  2011\u20132014  estimates,  a  total  investment  of \n4. \nRp65.3  trillion  is  needed for Indonesia to  achieve the  MDG for  water supply  and  sanitation by \n2015  (footnote  1,  p.  29).6 As  the  funding  capacity  for  the  2011\u20132014  investment  program  is \nlimited  to  Rp28.5  trillion,  the  shortfall  of  Rp36.8  trillion  demonstrates  how  public  expenditure \nalone cannot sufficiently address the country\u2019s water sector needs. \n \n5. \nConcession history. Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya), a state-\nowned enterprise, was established in 1977 to manage water supply and sewerage services in \nJakarta. However, despite high tariffs compared with other Asian countries, PAM Jaya could not \nsustain  an  efficient  management  or  investment  program  to  meet  the  needs  of  residents.

Each concession was granted pursuant to the \nterms of a cooperation agreement. \n\n6. \nUnder  the  cooperation  agreements,  each  concessionaire  is  responsible  for  the \nproduction  and  distribution  of  clean  water,  including  the  expansion  and  maintenance  of  the \nwater  assets,  for  its  respective  assigned  service  areas  in  Jakarta.  Responsibilities  include  the \nprovision  of  water  services  to  residential,  industrial,  and  commercial  customers,  as  well  as \nmanagement of billing and collections. Revenue collected by each concessionaire is placed in \nan escrow account. PAM Jaya receives a proportion7 as payment for its day-to-day monitoring \nand supervision of the relevant concession, and the concessionaires receive a water charge8 for \neach cubic meter of water produced.  \n \n7. \nThe  concessionaires  have  faced  sizeable  challenges.  Indonesia  was  affected  by  the \nAsian financial crisis in the late 1990s and due to economic and political turmoil, PAM Jaya was \nunable to implement the tariff increases as agreed in the cooperation agreements. The resulting \ntariff freeze initiated a buildup of PAM Jaya accounts payable and strained the sustainability of \nthe  concessionaire  operations.  In  2001,  PAM  Jaya  signed  a  restated  cooperation  agreement \n(RCA) with TPJ and PALYJA to try and resolve the tariff issue. The RCA laid the foundation for \nthe creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB), which was intended to be \nan  independent regulator  in  charge of  supervising  the concessions  and  reviewing requests for \ntariff increases on behalf of the governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. \n\n8. \nIn 2003, for the first time since 1998, the average water tariff (charged to consumers) of \nRp5,000  per  cubic  meter  became  higher  than  the  water  charge  (paid  to  concessionaires)  of \nRp4,000 per cubic meter. In July 2004, the Jakarta City Council agreed to an automatic water \ntariff  adjustment  every  6  months  over  5  years  to  allow  PAM  Jaya  to  pay  accumulated  water \ncharge  arrears  to  the  concessionaires.  The  water  tariff  adjustment  formula  assumed  that \nincreases in the water charge as well as any changes in the financial requirements of PAM Jaya \nand  JWSRB  would  be  fully  passed  on  to  consumers.  However,  the  adjustment  was  only \nimplemented from 2004 to 2007.  \n\n9. \nTransfer  of  ownership.  In  2007,  TPJ\u2019s  majority  owner,  Thames  Water  Overseas, \ndivested 95% of its ownership9 in TPJ to Acuatico through a competitive bid process. Acuatico is \na special purpose investment vehicle incorporated in Singapore. TPJ subsequently changed its \nname to Aetra Air Jakarta. \n\n10. \n2012  master  agreement.  Following  various  further  amendments  of  the  cooperation \nagreement  (from  2001  onwards), 10 Aetra  and  PAM  Jaya  entered  into  a  master  agreement, \nsigned  on  5 June  2012  to  address  a  number  of  fundamental  issues  with  the  East  Jakarta \nconcession. The master agreement came into effect in April 2012. One of the key principles of \nthe master agreement is that Aetra will operate under the assumption of no overall average tariff \n\n                                                \n7  Part  of  PAM  Jaya\u2019s  receipts,  also  known  as  the  \u2015first  party  primary  requirement\u2016  covers  the  debt  service \nrequirement of PAM Jaya to the Ministry of Finance for loans taken prior to the water concession privatization.  \n8  The  water  charge  is  a  flat  fee  that  the  concessionaires  receive,  which  is  delinked  from  the  actual  water  tariff \n\ncharged to consumers, which is tiered according to each customer\u2019s socioeconomic status. \n\n9  The  decision  of  Thames  Water  Overseas  to  divest  its  overseas  holdings,  including  TPJ,  was  part  of  a  global \n\nstrategic decision for the company to refocus its core business back in Europe. \n\n10 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nincrease. In addition, the master agreement confirms the water charges to be applied to the end \nof the concession period, as well as a reduction in Aetra\u2019s internal rate of return from 22.00% to \n15.85%. The parties intend to enter into a further amended and restated cooperation agreement \n(ARCA)  in 2013  so that the  cooperation  agreement  is  entirely  consistent  with the terms  of  the \nmaster  agreement.  This  will  require  numerous  provisions  of  the  cooperation  agreement  to  be \nreviewed and harmonized. \n\n11. \nADB  has  been  involved,  through  its  nonsovereign  operations,  in  the  Indonesian  water \nsector  since  2007,  when  it  approved  a  loan  of  Rp455  billion  (approximately  $50  million)  to \nPALYJA,  for  its  $121  million  capital  expenditure  program  for  2008\u20132012. 11  ADB\u2019s  relevant \nexperience makes engagement with Aetra a natural complement to ADB\u2019s water strategy in the \nGreater Jakarta region. \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n12. \nThe East Jakarta concession provides water supply services through 340,000 residential \nconnections  (both  piped  water  and  hydrants)  and  49,000  commercial  and/or  industrial \ncustomers  in a  concession  area  with a  total  population of  4.6 million.12 Approximately  740,000 \nmillion liters of treated water are distributed daily through 5,929 kilometers of pipeline network. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and/or Sponsor \n\n13. \nAetra is owned by Acuatico (95%) and Alberta Utilities (5%). Incorporated in Singapore, \nAcuatico  is  a  leading  investor,  developer,  and  operator  of  water  infrastructure  projects  with  a \nfocus  on  Indonesia  and  Viet  Nam.  It  operates  as  a  joint  venture  between  Recapital  Advisors \n(50%),  a  major  Indonesian  investment  and  financial  advisory  company,  and  Avenue  Capital \nGroup  (50%),  an  asset  management  company  based  in  New  York.  The  Acuatico  portfolio \nincludes  a  25-year  water  production  and  distribution  concession  in  the  Tangerang  region  in \nIndonesia,  a  30-year  water  supply  contract  for  a  Jakarta  development,  and  two  separate  \n20-year water supply and distribution concessions in Viet Nam. \n \n14. \nThe four managing directors of Aetra have an average of 20 years of experience in the \nindustry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian water sector. One \nof  the  directors  is  seconded  from  PAM  Jaya,  bringing  expertise  as  well  as  encouraging \ncooperation between Aetra and the grantor of its concession. Aetra management is supported \nby  a  team  of  633  key  operations  staff  with  an  average  of  17  years  of  industry  experience.13 \nLeveraging  the  strength  of  management  and  staff  expertise,  Aetra  has  maintained  profitability \nevery  year  since  the  management  team  was  appointed,  following  the  change  of  ownership  of \nthe  concessionaire  in  2007.  Management  is  overseen  by  a  five-member  board,  which \nsupervises company  strategy  and  management.  The  board  includes  experienced  water  sector \nprofessionals from Southeast Asia as well as key personnel from Acuatico to provide financial, \nlegal, and engineering expertise. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2007.

The project supports the government\u2019s effort to meet the MDG 7 target for water \nsupply  by  increasing  access  to  improved  drinking  water  sources  through  investment  in  critical \nwater infrastructure, helping the people of Indonesia gain access to more stable and affordable \npiped  water  supply.  The  commercial  success  of  this  concession  is  also  expected  to  attract \nprivate sector participation in water concessions in other cities across the country.  \n \n16.  Meeting  the  impact  targets  will  require  improvements  in  the  overall  regulatory \nenvironment  for  the  water  sector  in  Indonesia  as  well  as  public  sector  investment  to  provide \n\u2015last-mile  connectivity\u2016  for  low-income  households  that  currently  rely  on  relatively  expensive \nwater  supplied  by  vendors.14 ADB  nonsovereign  and  sovereign  operations15 have  collaborated \nto  build  JWSRB  capacity  (para.  23)  and  expand  access  to  the  urban  poor  (para. 29). \nCoordination  with  ADB  public  sector  efforts  to  improve  the  regulatory  framework  in  the \nIndonesian water sector and facilitate connectivity is essential to achieving the project\u2019s impact. \n \n17. \nfinancially viable Aetra. \n \n18. \nOutput. The output will be the completion of the 2013\u20132017 capital expenditure program \nfor Aetra, involving (i) the rehabilitation and upgrading of production facilities; (ii) the expansion, \nrehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of  distribution  networks;  and  (iii) \nimproved  corporate \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  standards.  The  investment  is  expected  to  add  45,000  new \nresidential  water  connections,  benefiting  both  individual  households  and  communities  with \naccess to a shared water connection. \n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  water  provision  in  East  Jakarta  by  a  more \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n19. \nThe  project  directly  supports  infrastructure  development,  one  of  the  core  areas  of \nStrategy  2020.16 The  project targets  solving  critical  underinvestment  problems  in  the  operation \nand maintenance of key urban infrastructure assets to facilitate more sustainable urbanization.  \nThe project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Indonesia \nthrough its first pillar of inclusive growth, which includes support for catalytic projects to improve \naccess  to  water  supply  in  selected  cities  and  towns  in  Indonesia. 17 It  supports  government \nefforts  to  expand  access  to  improved  water  supply  services,  particularly  for  poor  and \nunderserved populations, and strengthens local government capacity for public service delivery. \nThe  project  is  also  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy\u2019s  focus  on  enhanced \ncollaboration  between  ADB's  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  operations  to  improve  the  business \nclimate  and  engage  in  capacity  building  to  promote  bankable,  scalable  public\u2013private \npartnership projects. \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 \n\n20. \nThe  project  promotes  development  of  sustainable  water  supply  and  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which  identifies  increased  efficiency  in  water  use \nand greater private sector partnership as priority solutions in response to the huge unmet water \n\n                                                \n14 As of 2012, 1 cubic meter of water from a vendor is priced at Rp35,000\u2013Rp72,000, compared with the projected \n\naverage tariff of piped water at Rp7,600.  \n\n15 Southeast Asia Department, Urban Development and Water Division.  \n16 ADB. 2008.

In  2011,  PALYJA\u2019s  performance  was  limited  by  a  tariff  freeze \nand  the  unavailability  of  new  sources  of  bulk  water.  However,  through  prudent  cash \nmanagement  and  operating  efficiency,  PALYJA\u2019s  2011  financial  and  operating  performance \nremained positive, and outstanding debt servicing capacity for the ADB debt remains strong. \n  \n22. \nADB\u2019s financing of PALYJA illustrates the importance of ADB engaging with JWSRB and \nPAM Jaya to ensure continuous dialogue between the two entities to facilitate the resolution of \ndisputes over the cooperation agreement. ADB has approved a capacity building opportunity for \nJWSRB  to  enhance  its  effectiveness  and  facilitate  the  performance  of  its  functions  as  an \nindependent regulator in the Jakarta water sector. This is expected to considerably enhance the \nsuccess of the project.19 \n\nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n23. \nAetra  is  responsible  for  procurement;  obtaining  government  approvals;  carrying  out \nenvironmental  and  social  assessments,  preparing  audit  reports,  and  overseeing  capital \ninvestment.

The  initial  capacity  building  exercise  took  place  in  October  2012  and  involved  meetings \nwith Manila\u2019s water concessionaires and Manila\u2019s independent regulator, as well as relevant site visits.  \n20 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2.)  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory \nframework \n\nManagement \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nUnder Law No. 22 of 1999 on regional governance, authority for all aspects of local \ninfrastructure and service delivery, including planning, providing financing, and \nmanaging water supply and sanitation, was devolved from the central government \nto district and city governments. In 1997, PAM Jaya offered the right to operate \nJakarta\u2019s water supply system to private enterprises under two separate \nconcessions. Under the cooperation agreements, the concessionaires are \nresponsible for expanding and maintaining water assets in Jakarta, providing water \nservices to residents, and managing billing and collections.  \nThe four managing directors of Aetra have an average of 20 years of experience in \nthe industry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian \nwater sector, including PAM Jaya. Main operations staff have an average of 17 \nyears of industry experience. Aetra has maintained profitability every year since \nthe management team was appointed, following the change of ownership of the \nconcessionaire in 2007. \nLoan availability period: March 2013\u2013March 2016 \n\nImplementation  \nOperating arrangements \n\nRevenue and \ncost structure \n\nUnder the 25-year cooperation agreement, revenue collected by Aetra is placed in \nan escrow account. Aetra receives a flat water charge for each cubic meter of \nwater produced. The water charge is delinked from the water tariff. \nAetra will directly manage its capital investment program as well as associated \noperation and maintenance activities.  \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \nRelevant parties  Aetra, the borrower, is owned by Acuatico (95%) and Alberta Utilities (5%). \nAetra will report key performance indicators, including output and outcome \nindicators.  \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n24. \nThe project is financially viable because the expected financial internal rate of return is \nhigher  than the  weighted average cost  of  capital. The  project  is  economically  sustainable with \nan economic internal rate of return higher than the social discount rate of 12%.21 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nThe  assistance  will  be  a  corporate  unsecured  loan  to  Aetra  of  up  to  Rp430  billion \n\n25. \n(approximately $44.7 million) without government guarantee. \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\n                                                \n21 ADB.  2003.  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Operations  Manual.  OM  G1/BP.  Manila.  An  economic  return  on \ninvested capital of 10%\u201312% is acceptable as a hurdle rate for projects with significant unquantifiable benefits. The \nEvaluation Cooperation Group's Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations rates a project \nsatisfactory if the economic return on invested capital is 10% or higher. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  project  is  justified  through  (i)  diversified  financing\u2014Aetra \ncurrently has access to financing from local commercial banks, and ADB participation will help \nAetra  diversify  its  sources  of  local  currency financing;  and (ii)  public\u2013private  partnerships\u2014the \nproject is an excellent example of the complementary value offered by ADB\u2019s private and public \nsector  operations.  While  the  private  sector  investment  will  help  ensure  Aetra  achieves  its \ntechnical and financial targets without tariff increases, ADB as a whole brings value as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImproving \u201clast-mile\u201d connections. While the investment in water treatment is \nessential  to  complement  existing  public  sector  efforts22 to  increase  the  quality, \nquantity, and reliability of Jakarta\u2019s raw water supply through investments in West \nTarum Canal and Bekasi siphon, public investment in the distribution network is \nalso  needed,  especially  for  poorer  areas  of  the  city.  ADB  sovereign  operations \nwill provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) in 2013 to introduce \nprograms similar to those implemented by local governments in other Indonesian \ncities,  and  similar  to  the  Tubig  para  sa  Barangay  (Water  for  the  Community \nProgram)  of  Manila  Water  in  the  Philippines.  The  TA  will  provide  an  additional \navenue for Aetra to reach the urban poor.23  \n \nEnhancing the efficiency of the independent regulatory body. In 2012, ADB \nnonsovereign  and  sovereign  operations  successfully  used  regional  TA  funds  to \nbuild the capacity of JWSRB through dialogue with regulators in Manila. The plan \ninvolves twinning JWSRB with other regulators in Southeast Asia and outside the \nregion  to  facilitate  the  knowledge  and  experience  exchange.  The  twinning \nprogram would give JWSRB the opportunity to adopt or learn from management \nmodels that have achieved success in other similar concession areas. \n \n\n Through  its  collaborative  approach,  the  project  will  demonstrate  how  public\u2013private \n27. \npartnerships  can  help  water  projects  in  Indonesia  remain  commercially  and  technically  viable, \nand  can  benefit  from  ongoing  regulatory  reform.  This  assistance  complements  ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in PALYJA. ADB\u2019s holistic engagement in Jakarta will allow ADB to better observe \nand raise issues with the government on key policy challenges facing the evolving Indonesian \nwater  sector.  Moreover,  combined  with  experience  across  ADB,  the  project  will  help  ADB \nmeaningfully  contribute  to  dialogue  on  water  sector  management  and  regulation  throughout \nSoutheast Asia. \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n28. \nRaw  water  risk.  Aetra\u2019s  water  supply  originates  from  the  Jatiluhur  reservoir  and  flows \nthrough  West  Tarum  Canal.  As  such,  Aetra  is  exposed  to  possible  water  supply  interruptions \nthrough  (i)  inadequate  maintenance  and  repair  of  the  canal  and  associated  pumping  stations; \nand (ii) lack of management capacity of Perum Jasa Tirta II, the canal operator. To date, overall \nraw  water  availability  has  been  adequate  and  the  risk  of  short-term  supply  interruptions  is \nmitigated  through  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  assistance  on  improving  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement in the Citarum Basin. One such project, ADB\u2019s construction of the Bekasi  siphon \n(to  be  completed  in  2013),  will  markedly  improve Aetra\u2019s  raw  water  supply  quality  by  diverting \n\n                                                \n22 ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Integrated  Citarum  Water \n\nResources Management Investment Program in Indonesia. Manila.  \n\n23 The  TA  will  share  key  success  factors  from  programs  that have  successfully  implemented  last-mile  connections, \n\nincluding flexible financing, public consultation, and customization of delivery systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nflows from Bekasi River away from the canal. This will improve Aetra\u2019s water quality and lower \nassociated  treatment  costs.    Aetra  does  not  have  direct  water  supply  contract  with  Jatiluhur \nreservoir operator Perum Jasa Tirta II; its raw water is supplied by Perum Jasa Tirta II under a \nfive yearly renewable contract with Pam Jaya (due for renewal in December 2016). The lender\u2019s \ntechnical  advisor  considers  that  a  failure  by  PAM  Jaya  to  supply  bulk  water  to  Aetra  is  highly \nunlikely given the social and political importance of a steady water supply for Jakarta. \n \n29.  \n Regulatory risk. Since Aetra and PAM Jaya have neither the authority nor control over \nincreases in the levels of the water tariff, the master agreement fixes the water tariff schedules \nat  their  currently  agreed  levels  for  the  remainder  of  the  concession  period.    The  master \nagreement also provides for an agreed set of financial projections that allow for Aetra to operate \nsustainably.    ADB  has  identified  that  the  financial  projections  need  to  ensure  a  clear  linkage \nbetween  all  financial  statements  and  therefore  ADB  will  enter  into  the  facility  agreement  only \nafter  it  is  satisfied  that  appropriate  revisions  have  been  made  to  the  financial  projections.    In \nlight  of  the  multiple  amendments  to  the  cooperation  agreement  to-date,  Aetra  and  PAM  Jaya \nare scheduled to execute the ARCA in 2013 which will consolidate the cooperation agreement \nso that it is entirely consistent with the master agreement. The master agreement stipulates the \nnature of the amendments to be expected. ADB\u2019s review of the ARCA prior to its execution will \nbe a condition of ADB\u2019s second loan disbursement.   \n \nRevenue risk. Under the master agreement, Aetra must operate within the constraint of \n30. \nwater tariff schedule remaining fixed for the remainder of the concession period.  This requires \nAETRA to achieve a higher average tariff from its customer base via customer reclassifications \nand to progress with NRW reductions, in order to grow its revenues.  NRW remains a key issue \nfor Aetra.  The lender\u2019s technical advisor also notes that Aetra has robust systems in place to \nallow for early detection of leaks and related repair.  Under the new operating principles agreed \nto  in the  master  agreement,  both  Aetra  and  PAM  Jaya  agree  that  Aetra  can  achieve  long-run \nfinancial and operational viability under the current arrangements.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n31.   Accumulated  receivables  risk.    If  the  operating  cash  flow  falls  short  of  projections, \nAetra\u2019s liquidity position could be adversely affected, especially in 2015 when a large portion of \nits  debts  will  come  due.    To  minimize  the  risk  of  a  tight  liquidity  situation  Aetra  can  consider \nraising additional debt (from its current base of modest leverage) or conserving cash by limiting \ndividend payouts.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n32.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n33.   Execution  risk.  The  four  managing  directors  of  Aetra  have  an  average  of  20  years  of \nexperience in the industry and retain strong relationships with all stakeholders in the Indonesian \nwater  sector,  including  PAM  Jaya  itself.    After  Acuatico  took  over  the  concessionaire  from \nThames Water,  Aetra  has  reversed  its  accumulated  deficit  into  a  surplus.    There  is  continuity \nwith  the  staff  that  performs  operations  and  maintenance  services,  as  they  are  carried  out  in-\nhouse by experienced technicians who have been with the concessionaire from the time when \nThames Water was Aetra\u2019s primary owner.  \n \n\nTail risk and financing risk.  \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n34.

Aetra\u2019s past and present performance on environmental and social \nsafeguards  was  audited  and  found  satisfactory.  Aetra  will  take  actions  stipulated  in  the \ncorrective action plan in the audit report, including improvement of its environmental and social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Aetra  will \nconfirm to ADB annually its compliance with national laws and the ESMS, and provide reports \naccordingly. The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples.  It  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or  relocation  of  inhabitants  since  rehabilitation  of \nexisting connections and development of new connections will be along the roadsides or rights-\nof-way.  Nevertheless,  Aetra  has  reviewed  the  land  acquisition  history  of  the  proposed  sites  to \nensure  that  national  requirements  were  met,  and  ADB\u2019s  requirements  were  complied  with. \nFurthermore,  as  the  project  is  located  in  East  Jakarta,  where  no  indigenous  peoples  live,  no \nimpact on indigenous peoples is foreseen. \n \n36. \nADB  assesses  the  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Aetra  to  manage  the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts as adequate.24 Measures to benefit new connection \nhouseholds, including benefits to women through reduced water collection times and improved \nhealth  conditions,  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender and Development (1998). ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes \nappropriate  provisions  requiring  Aetra  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  take  specific \nmeasures (including contractors) in relation to the internationally recognized core labor standard \nfor  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  project,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy.25 \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n37. \nAetra  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003).26 \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nrequires Aetra to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  and  money \nlaundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities.   \n\n                                                \n24  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25  ADB. 2001.
