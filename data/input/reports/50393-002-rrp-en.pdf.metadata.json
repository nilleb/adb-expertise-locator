The  main \nbeneficiaries of the project will be members of cooperatives, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nand  contracted  farmers  in  the  seven  prefectures  that  comprise  the  project  area:  Baiyin,  Dingxi, \nJiuquan, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Wuwei, and Zhangye. The project will include design features to ensure \nthat farmers have access to high-value e-commerce markets and thereby increase their income. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAgricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged behind industrial production and \nurban livelihoods in the PRC. As a result, income inequality and poverty persist in rural areas of \nlesser-developed  regions  of  the  PRC.  Increasing  productivity  and  value  addition  through \nmodernization and enhanced market linkages has considerable poverty reduction potential in the \nPRC, where agriculture labor still accounts for more than 25% of total employment. Against this \nbackdrop, the Government of the PRC formulated the rural vitalization strategy for 2018\u20132022 to \npromote  poverty  reduction,  rural  development,  and  green  and  inclusive  growth.1  The  rural \nvitalization  strategy  focuses  on  modernizing  agriculture  with the  application  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), which is intended to increase agricultural productivity, reduce \nfood safety risks, and cut pollution from fertilizers and pesticides. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to strategically program \nADB\u2019s lending support for rural vitalization development initiatives. \n \n4. \nInternet-plus  agriculture  refers  to  the  application  of  network-connected  information \ntechnology  along  the  entire  value  chain  from  production  to  marketing.  This  enhances  market \naccess  through  a  two-way  automated  information  exchange  system  between  producers  and \nconsumers. It provides consumers with product information while producers get access to market \ninformation and production support services. Internet-plus has shown great potential to increase \nincome in rural areas through (i) stabilized demand via access to e-commerce, and (ii) reduced \nproduction costs from avoided food losses along the value chain as a result of expanded smart \nstorage  and  processing  capacity.  This  project  will  demonstrate  the  application  of  network-\nconnected sensors and tracing technologies to provide product quality and safety information to \nconsumers and to enhance market access and technical support for farmers. \n \n5. \nGansu province, in the northwest of the PRC, is the seventh-largest province in the PRC \nwith  a  population  of  26.20  million,  of  which  14.44  million  (55.1%)  live  in  rural  areas.2  In  2016, \nGansu\u2019s  total  gross  domestic  product  was  CNY720  billion,  of  which  agriculture  accounted  for \n13.7%. In 2017, Gansu\u2019s gross domestic product per capita of CNY29,326 (equivalent to about \n\n                                                \n1   Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State \n\nCouncil. 2018.

Beijing.  \n \n\n \n\n\f$4,417)3 was the lowest of all provinces in the PRC, and 50% of the province\u2019s 87 counties are \ndesignated as national poverty counties. In the proposed project prefectures, 6.5%\u201310.5% of the \nrural population live below the national annual income poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita.4  \n \nInformation  asymmetry  about  product  quality  and  safety  characteristics  (e.g.,  origin  of \n6. \ninputs, farming system, food safety, nutrition values) has led to selection of low-value products, \nwhich compromises traceability, food safety, and competitiveness in developing high-value online \nand  offline  markets  in  Gansu  and  other  provinces.  The  project  design  contains  innovative \nagriculture internet-plus features, which aims to achieve global public goods, such as enhanced \nfood  safety  and  reduced  environmental  pollution.  ICT-supported  value  chain  services  for \ntraceability  and  food  safety  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  farmers  to  access  high-value  e-\ncommerce  markets  through  the  network  of  relevant  business  entities  (e.g.,  traders,  logistics \nservices, wholesalers, and retailers).  \n \n7. \nUncoordinated  business  relationships  between  the  primary  and  processing  segments \ndominate the agriculture sector. Farmers\u2019 decisions on the quality and quantity of applied water, \nfertilizers, and pesticides for crop growth are not documented or optimized through the application \nof  modern  precision  technology.  Real-time  information  services  on  specific  agro-ecological \nconditions, such as soil fertility, moisture, and temperature, are missing. Excessive application of \nwater, fertilizers, and pesticides are common inefficient input uses in crop production, resulting in \nhigh production costs, nonpoint source pollution, food safety risks, and inefficient water usage. \nBusiness upscaling of processing operations through contract farming arrangements to realize \neconomies of scale is constrained by high sourcing costs for inputs because of high transaction \ncosts with small-scale entities. Many processing operations lack adequate coordination of storage \nfacilities, transportation, and marketing capacity which would enable them to produce the volume \nand quality needed to access premium e-commerce and offline markets. \n\n8. \nLimited ICT capacity of farmers, processors, and other service providers is constraining the \nadoption  of  integrated  and  automated  information  exchange  systems,  which  could  facilitate  the \ncoordination and cooperation between business entities in the production and marketing segments. \nLimited technology application capacity of farmer cooperatives hampers access  to high-value e-\ncommerce markets and adoption of modern production methods. The primary production segment \nis characterized by scattered unorganized  production  of small-scale farmers with  low bargaining \npower  and  low-value  crop  production.  Although  the  Gansu  Supply  and  Marketing  Cooperatives \nUnion  (GSSMCU)  is  providing  agro-technology  advice  to farmers, the  high  demand for  product-\nspecific support services to enable access to ICT-supported e-commerce markets is largely unmet. \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \nGovernment  policy.  Improving  rural  livelihoods,  and  particularly  eradicating  extreme \npoverty  by  2020,  is  a  key  priority  under  the  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan  on  National \nEconomic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.5 The PRC has initiated internet-plus policies with \nthe objective of integrating the agriculture sector into the wider economy through the use of ICT \nsolutions to link rural economic development approaches to service delivery in rural areas. The \ngovernment is committed to eradicating poverty and closing the income gap that exists between \nurban and rural populations. E-commerce and internet-based support services are accelerating \n\n                                                \n3   Based on an average 2016 exchange rate of $1.00 = CNY6.64. \n4   Project interventions are planned in Baiyin, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Wuwei, and Zhangye prefectures with some project \n\n5   Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

The  project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  creating  knowledge  and \npromoting  rural  development  and  food  security.6  Supporting  inclusive  economic  growth  is  a  key \nstrategic  priority  for  ADB  in  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC.7  The  Gansu  Provincial \nGovernment (GPG) requested ADB assistance in implementing the PRC\u2019s focus on an internet-\nplus approach to promoting agriculture-based industry for local specialty agricultural products. This \nproject supports the improvement of market connectivity and value-chain linkages, which is one of \nthe four priority areas of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources.8 Support \nto rural development, through agricultural modernization and value chain promotion approaches, is \none of the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC (footnote 7). \n \n11. \nLessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons from  previous  and  ongoing  projects \nfinanced  by  ADB  and  others  in  the  PRC.9  The  lessons  include  (i)  enabling  farmers  and \nagribusiness  companies  to  finance  longer-term  investment  to  increase  production,  improve \nproductivity,  enhance  value  addition,  and  access  new  markets;  (ii)  engaging  agribusiness \ncompanies  to  create  income-generating  opportunities;  (iii)  helping  farmers  improve  access  to \nmarkets and improve product quality control through cooperation with agribusiness companies; \nand  (iv)  engaging  agribusiness  companies  to  involve  farmers  and  cooperatives  for  improved \nproduction enterprises and equitable benefit sharing. \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive economic opportunities in \n12. \nthe rural  areas  of Gansu  province  increased,  and (ii)  poverty  in  rural  areas of Gansu  province \nreduced.10  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  income-generating  opportunities  from \nagricultural production and marketing increased.11 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Comprehensive information service and management platform developed. \nThis  output  will  develop  data  centers  with  information  platforms  to  process  data generated from \nproject facilities established under output 2 for increased production and processing efficiency and \nfor e-commerce marketing purposes. This will include (i) constructing data and training centers, (ii) \nprocuring ICT equipment and technical advisory services, and (iii) training farmers and enterprise \nstaff to build capacity in ICT application in the agriculture production and processing segment. The \nplatform  will  provide  product  origin,  quality,  safety  monitoring,  and  tracing  services  as  well  as \nmanagement  advice  for the  coordination  and  optimization  of  agricultural  production,  processing, \nand marketing activities.

The \nplatform is intended to be scalable and inclusive to provide project-generated market information, \nand  agricultural  support  services  to  a  wide  range  of  beneficiaries,  especially  farmers  who  lack \naccess to markets and high-quality technical support services.  \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Agricultural production, processing, storage, and marketing modernized. \nThis output will (i) establish demonstration agricultural production enterprises for high-value crop \nproduction  including  summer  vegetables,  potatoes,  fruits,  and  licorice;  and  forage  crop \nproduction, in particular mulberry plants;12 (ii) equip the demonstration enterprises with internet-\nof-things (IOT)13 applications for product quality and safety monitoring and increased production \nefficiency,  and  coordination  with  other  segments  of  the  agriculture  sector;  (iii)  construct \nwarehouses,  cold  storage  facilities,  and  market  facilities  to  increase  value  addition;  and  (iv) \nfinance  ICT  and  transport  equipment  to  promote  an  integrated  and  automated  information \nexchange  network  for  enhanced  coordination  and  quality  assurance  at  distribution,  storage, \nprocessing, and marketing facilities. Global positioning systems together with network-connected \nsensors  for  soil  moisture,  temperature,  and  optical  spectrum  will  be  utilized  to  monitor  and \noptimize the quantity and timing of irrigation, fertilizer application, and harvesting depending on \nthe intrafield variability of crops and soil conditions. Project-financed improvements to processing \nand storage services facilities will benefit small farmers including women and vulnerable groups \nthrough enhanced market access. The production enterprises will be used for demonstration and \ntraining  purposes  to  increase  access  and  quality  of  agriculture  technology  and  management \nsupport services for small farmers, including women and vulnerable groups in rural areas, who \nwill benefit as suppliers or members of the cooperatives.  \n \nOutput 3: Capacity of Gansu Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Union improved. \n15. \nThis  output  will  (i)  provide  project-related  training,  including  on  IOT,  to  GSSMCU,  project \nimplementation unit (PIU), and other related government agency staff in implementing the project; \n(ii) support study tours, in particular with respect to precision agriculture, modern internet-based \nmarketing, quality control, and traceability; and (iii) promote participation in capacity building and \nknowledge sharing events. The output will improve the capacity of GSSMCU staff to implement \nprojects and to work within an internet-based working environment. \n \nInnovations. IOT tracing sensors will be installed along production and processing lines \n16. \nso as to allow the identification of product batches. This will provide credible product origin and \nfood safety certification data on branded fresh and processed agricultural products. Greenhouses \nand  agriculture  production  bases  for  high-value  crops  will  be  equipped  with  temperature,  soil \nfertility  and  moisture  sensors  to  optimize  fertilizer  and  water  application.  Depending  on  the \nintrafield soil and crop variability, both production costs and environmental pollution will be cut. \nProject  platforms  will  provide  tailored  agriculture  precision  farming  and  value  chain  services \nthough  IOT  applications.  Production  batch  identification  technology  will  also  be  installed  in \nwarehouses  and  logistics  fleets  to  achieve  higher  cost-effectiveness  of  the  distribution  system \nand  online  delivery  linkages  to  e-commerce  platforms.  The  project  investment  in  value  chain \nservices will enable farmers to access e-commerce and is envisaged to act as a catalyst to attract \nlarge-scale private sector activities for  value chain services related to e-commerce in this poor \nprovince. \n                                                \n12 Participating enterprises were selected with regard to their potential to increase rural incomes and promoting the \napplication of internet-plus technologies. Details on the selection process and selected enterprises\u2019 existing business \nmodels are available in Appendix 3 of the project administration manual and the linked document Financial Analysis. \n13  The IOT refers to physical devices embedded with sensors and network connection capability that enable these devices \nto collect and exchange data. It allows remote sensing and control of devices through existing internet infrastructure.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fKnowledge  sharing.

Licensed \ndomestic  design  institutes  prepared  all  project  components.  The  domestic  feasibility  studies \ninclude varied degrees of adoption of agriculture internet-plus ecosystems, such as IOT, big data \nsystems, cloud technology architecture including internet connectivity, and e-commerce platform \nsolutions  across  the  subprojects.  The  project  team  can  choose  and  adopt  the  internet-plus \nagriculture technologies appropriate for each subproject. This federated approach is a process \ninnovation.  The  feasibility  study  also  proposes  centralized  capacity  building  and  institutional \nsupport activities by the GPG to sustain the federated adoption of internet-plus in the project. The \nimplementation  requirement  factored  in  a  total  cost  of  ownership  approach  to  include \nmaintenance and operations dimensions.  \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe  economic  analysis  indicated  that  the  overall  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 20.4% and an economic net present value of CNY1.2 \nbillion. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of output 1 with an EIRR of 17.2% and \noutput 2 with an EIRR of 21.8%, and of the seven subprojects. Sensitivity analysis indicated that \nthe  project  is  robust  to  negative  scenarios  examined,  such  as  an  increase  in  investment  costs, \nreduction  of  benefits,  and  increase  in  operation  and  maintenance  cost.  The  financial  analysis \nincluded financial evaluations of the subprojects and financial statements analyses of the PIUs to \ndetermine  the  financial  viability  and  financial  sustainability  of  all  the  subprojects.  The  financial \nevaluations reveal that the financial internal rate of return of each subproject exceeds the weighted \ncost of capital, indicating that the overall project is financially viable. Sensitivity analysis indicated \nthat  the  project  remains  financially  viable  when  it  is  influenced  by  adverse  changes  in  key \nquantifiable variables. The financial statements analyses demonstrate that the PIUs have adequate \nfinancial capacity to cover the incremental recurrent costs for operation and maintenance for all the \nsubprojects. The project is considered financially sustainable.  \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe financial management assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nGuidance Note for Financial Management Assessment.17 The financial management assessment \nassessed the financial management capacity of the GSSMCU, the project implementing agency, \nand the seven PIUs. The assessment confirmed that the project implementing agency and all the \nPIUs  have  adequate  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  in  place  to  implement  the \nproject  efficiently.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  moderate.  Given  that  the  project \nimplementing agency and the seven subproject implementing units are less familiar with ADB loan \nproceeds disbursement requirements and procedures, training activities will be required to further \nimprove  project  implementation  efficiency.  The  procurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  the \nimplementing agency, which will manage and monitor all procurements conducted by PIUs through \na  procurement  agency,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  consultants,  have  adequate \nprocurement  capacity  to  facilitate  full  compliance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time).

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n27. \nPoverty and social. ADB prepared the poverty and social analysis based on intensive \nstakeholder  consultations  and socioeconomic  surveys.  It  indicated  that  the  project  will  provide \nopportunities  for  inclusive  social  development  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  area.  The \nproject  will  (i)  support  a  cumulative  total  of  2,397  full-time  and  13,992  part-time  local  jobs,  (ii) \ninvolve 12,866 farmer households for contract farming, and (iii) benefit 110,000 rural households \nin  the  project  counties  as  internet-based  service  platform  users.  Among  the  beneficiary \nhouseholds, 30% are poor and low-income households that will benefit from local employment \nand other socioeconomic opportunities. The farmers will benefit from working or cooperating with \nagricultural enterprises or PIUs as their employees, contractual farmers, land lessors, and users \nof services supported during implementation and operation of the project. In addition, the project \nservices  will  also  benefit  8,500  entities  that  include  enterprises,  cooperatives,  and  supply  and \nmarketing cooperatives  in the  counties  and  towns.  ADB  prepared  a  social  development  action \nplan based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the poor and low-income \npeople.  ADB  conducted  consultations  with  the  farmers  and  stakeholders  during  the  project \npreparation  and  included  in  the  PAM  a  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  the  project \nimplementation stage.  \n \n28. \nGender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women are involved in \nagricultural and household work, and most are primarily engaged in labor-intensive farming and \nhave  low  incomes.  Women  have  less  knowledge  of  agricultural  technology,  fewer  job \nopportunities, and much lower involvement in decision making than men. The project is expected \nto benefit women significantly, as the majority of the employment and training opportunities will \nbe provided to women. ADB prepared a gender action plan (GAP) based on gender analyses to \nensure that the project contributes to improved gender equality.18 The GAP includes the following \nkey measures and targets for women: (i)  10,000 women trained to access project information, \nagricultural inputs, and other online services; (ii) 30 female specialists included in the technical \nteams; (iii) a total of 10,456 employment opportunities made available for women by the project \nenterprises; (iv) capacity building and training for 10,456 women conducted on employment and \nlabor  skills;  (v)  consultation  facilitated  with  women  in  contract  farming  and  land  leasing  (50% \nwomen); (vi) women\u2019s involvement ensured in consultation and participation for implementation \nof project\u2019s social aspects (50% women); and (vii) sex-disaggregated data collected for monitoring \nthe GAP and other relevant measures. ADB also included key gender targets in the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \nEnvironment (category B). The project team prepared an initial environmental examination \n30. \n(IEE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP), and it follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n18  Details are in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy  Statement.20  The  project  team  will  base  the  IEE  and  EMP  on  the  approved  domestic \nfeasibility study and environmental assessment reports, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. \nConsultations included  affected people and  local  government agencies, and the outcomes have \nbeen integrated in the project design. The draft IEE was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The GPG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for implementation and compliance with \nthe EMP, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. \nThe  implementing  agencies  have  no  prior  experience  of  ADB  safeguard  procedures,  and  loan \nimplementation consultants and a capacity building program are included in the project design. \n\n \n\n31. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  environmental  improvement,  including  (i) \nconserved  water  resources  through  improved  farming  efficiency,  soil  moisture  monitoring,  and \ncrop  selection;  and  (ii)  reduced  pollution  of  soil  and  water  through  efficient  use  of  agricultural \nchemicals.  Construction  risks  include  short-term  impacts  such  as  noise  and  dust.  Operational \nrisks  include  the  unsustainable  use  of  water  resources  and  increased  use  of  fertilizers  and \npesticides. Water balance assessments have confirmed that the project water use is within the \ncapacity of sources. Mitigation measures are described in the EMP. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  does  not  involve  involuntary  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The PIUs will use 5,114.5 mu of state-owned land for the \nconstruction of agricultural processing or logistics facilities.21  \n \n33. \nLand  leasing.  For  agriculture  production  purposes,  the  PIUs  will  use  collective-owned \nland leased through the voluntary land use right transfer (LURT) process. The LURT process is \na land leasing arrangement and will not change the ownership of collective-owned land. PIUs will \nuse a total of 66,240.4 mu of collective lands (41,380.4 mu leased already and 24,860.0 mu to be \nleased). The land use arrangements for existing or already leased lands were reviewed for due \ndiligence during the transaction technical assistance implementation and it was concluded that \nthe  LURT  agreements  were  conducted  in  a  voluntary,  transparent,  and  fair  manner  and  that \nrelevant principles of voluntary land leases had been followed.22 For the LURT agreements that \nwill  be  finalized  after  the  project  approval,  an  LURT  framework  has  been  prepared  providing \nnecessary  guidance  on  principles  and  procedures \nthe  project \nimplementation.  With  the  help  of  loan  implementation  consultants,  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies will internally monitor the implementation of the LURT framework and land \nleases, resolve any issues related to LURT, and report findings through periodic progress reports \nduring project implementation. An external social monitoring expert, who will be financed under \nADB  loan,  will  externally  monitor  land  leases  and  submit  annual  monitoring  reports  during  the \nproject implementation. \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project will not impact any distinct and vulnerable \nethnic minority communities that would trigger requirements on indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35. \nCapacity  for  implementation  and  monitoring  of  social  and  gender  measures.  The \nGPG  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects,  including  an  ADB-financed  agriculture \n\nto  be  followed  during \n\n                                                \n20 ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) is available both in English and Chinese (http://www.adb.org/ \n\nDocuments/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf and http://www.adb.org/Documents/ \nTranslations/Chinese/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-cn.pdf)  \n\n21  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters or 0.067 hectares). \n22 The LURT principles include that agreements follow legal procedures; contracting parties are informed and consulted; \nagreements are voluntary; farmers or lessors benefit from lease payment and other benefits, such as employment; \nand the lessors will not be adversely impacted. The same principles will also apply to house renting. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fproject. However, the GSSMCU and PIUs do not have experience in implementing ADB projects. \nTo implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the GSSMCU and the PIUs will appoint a \nsocial and gender focal person; and (ii) the loan implementation consultant will include a social \nand gender consultant to provide training and capacity building to the focal staff for implementing, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  social  and  gender  measures  including  the  GAP,  social  development \naction plan, and LURT framework.  \n \nF. \n \n36. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDisputes between PIUs and affected \nfarmers. \n\nMitigation Measures \nProject design based on maximizing collaboration between \nPIUs and farmers. \n\nPIU = project implementation unit.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n37. \nThe government and the GPG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and the GPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n\u20ac118,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Gansu  Internet-Plus  Agriculture \nDevelopment Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  15  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n\n2 September 2019  \n\n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nInclusive economic opportunities in rural areas of Gansu province increaseda \nPoverty in rural areas of Gansu province reducedb \n\n \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nSample household survey \nand the provincial statistical \nyearbook  \n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nIncome-\ngenerating \nopportunities from \nagricultural \nproduction and \nmarketing \nincreased \n\nOutputs \n1.
