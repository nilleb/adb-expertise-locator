The structural reform priorities include efforts to enhance the business climate \nby  promoting  competition  policy,  regulatory  efficiency,  competitive  logistics,  and  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure projects through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The program \nalso  supports  the  government  in  promoting  competitive  labor  markets  by  piloting  a  youth \nemployment  program  to  empower  young  people  to  find  decent  jobs  (known  as  JobStart \nPhilippines)  and  a  tourism-industry-led  skills  and  services  development  program,  and  through \nlonger-term labor policy reforms. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nThe government has made employment creation the core of its inclusive growth strategy \n3. \nand has updated the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u20132016 to this effect. Investment \nin  education,  infrastructure,  and  improvements  to  the  investment  climate  to  attract  investment \nand create jobs are the top priorities of the economic program. \n \n4. \nJob creation. From 2010 to 2014, the Philippine economy enjoyed its fastest expansion \nsince  the  1970s.  Economic  growth  has  averaged  6.5%  per  annum,  well  above  its  long-term \ntrend  of  5.0%.  This  sustained  growth  is  becoming  manifest  in  a  modest  improvement  in  job \ncreation. Since 2010, full-time wage jobs\u2014a broad measure of decent jobs\u2014have expanded by \n3.7% per annum, slightly up from the average 3.4% during 1991\u20132010. According to the Bureau \nof  Labor  Statistics  survey  of  the  largest  1,000  corporations  in  the  Philippines,  new  hires  have \nexpanded  by  10.0%  per  annum  since  2011, doubling from  a  longer-term  average of  5.0%  per \nannum. While wage-job creation has picked up since 2010, it has not been sufficient to absorb \nall  new  job  seekers  or  make  a  dent  in  the  number  of  workers  crowded  into  the  nonwage  or \ninformal  employment  sector  (i.e.,  self-employed,  private  households,  and  unpaid  family \nworkers), of which the latter account for over half of the workforce. \n \n5. \nHigh rate of youth not in employment, education, or training. Youth unemployment \nrates  provide  limited  information  on  the  situation  of  out-of-work  young  people  because  they \nexclude  those  economically  inactive.  A  more  informative  measure  is  the  number  of  young \npeople \u201cnot in employment, education, or training\u201d (NEET). The NEET rate includes unemployed \nyouth and those staying at home. There is concern that repeated spells outside the labor market \nwithout  training  and  for  longer  periods  can  be  damaging  to  young  people\u2019s  future  career \nprospects  and  earnings.  It  can  also  perpetuate  lifetime  poverty  for  the  young  residing  in  poor \nhouseholds. The youth NEET rate in the Philippines is relatively high on a comparison with  its \nmiddle-income  peers.  For  example,  the  Philippines\u2019  youth  NEET  rate  (at  25.0%  of  the  youth \npopulation)  is  the  second  highest  behind  Indonesia  in  Southeast  Asia  and  above  the  rates \ncalculated for  the  larger Latin  American economies  of  Argentina,  Brazil, and Mexico,  which  all \nhave  youth  unemployment  problems.  In  the  Philippines,  more  than  one-third  of  young  women \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\fA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nfall  into  the  NEET  category,  compared  with  one  in  five  men.  Of  particular  concern  is  that  the \nyouth NEET rate is twice as high in low-income families than in high-income families, indicating \na  large  pool  of  young  people  from  lower-income  families  not  being  integrated  into  the  labor \nmarket despite the recent economic expansion. It reflects both insufficient growth in the demand \nfor  labor  and  a  serious  mismatch  of  technical  and  life  skills  in  this  demographic  group.  Thus, \nwhile  sustained  economic  growth  above  6.5%  per  annum  is  necessary  to  generate  jobs,  it  is \ninsufficient.  Structural  policy  reforms,  including  to  the  labor  market,  and  effectively  targeted \npublic  provisioning  of  employment  services  to  assist  at-risk  young  people  from  lower-income \nhouseholds in finding jobs are necessary to reduce the youth NEET rate. \n \n6. \nInvestment rate. Supporting the pickup in economic growth has been a solid recovery in \nprivate  and  public  investment.  The  fixed  investment  rate  started  to  decline  after  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  of  1997  and  bottomed  out  at  13.5%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2005.  It \nrecovered to  16.8%  of gross  domestic  product  by  2008  and  reached  19.4%  by  2012.  Still,  the \nfixed  investment  rate  in  the  Philippines  is  much  lower  than  in  most  other  Southeast  Asian \neconomies, such as Indonesia (33.2%), Malaysia (25.7%), and Thailand (28.5%). It has resulted \nin  lower  long-term  economic  growth  potential  of  around  5.0%  per  annum.  Much  higher \ninvestment  is  necessary  to  sustain  the  current  average  growth  rate  of  6.5%  per  annum.  In \nparticular, the Philippines continues to underinvest in infrastructure. \n \nCompetitiveness.  There  has  been  a  marked  improvement  in  the  rankings  of  the \n7. \nPhilippines  in key global  competitiveness  surveys  since  2010,  indicating significantly  improved \nperceptions  about  the  investment  climate  and  the  government\u2019s  reform  efforts.  For  example, \ncompared  with  2013,  the  Philippines  jumped  six  places  in  the  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  2014 \nGlobal Competitiveness Index to become 59th out of 148 countries. Still more needs to be done. \nThe  global  competitiveness  reports  identified  common  areas  for  the  government\u2019s  attention, \nsuch as reforms to the labor market, investment regime, business regulations, and the finance \nsector.  Continued  improvements  in  competitiveness  in  these  areas  would  establish  a  solid \nplatform for attracting investment and job creation.2 \n \n8. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  for  the \nPhilippines  is  consistent  and  aligned  with  the  PDP  and  its  recent  midterm  review.3 It  has  set \nexpansion  in  investment  as  an  outcome  indicator.  ADB  has  extensive  experience  in  helping \nimprove  the  investment  climate  in  the  Philippines,  including  assistance  to  the  energy  sector, \ncapital market development, road infrastructure, and the business climate (footnote 2). \n \nThe  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive  Growth  Program  takes  a  programmatic \n9. \napproach. 4 It  has  two  subprograms  enveloped  by  a  medium-term  results-based  framework. \nSubprogram  1  was  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in  June  2012  (footnote  4). \nSubprogram 2 builds on the reforms under subprogram 1, with the main focus on implementing \npolicy  reforms  through  pilot  projects  to  demonstrate  reform  impact.  The  program  has  three \noutputs seen as critical for raising competitiveness and promoting labor market inclusiveness: (i) \nimplementing  structural  policy  reforms  to  the  economy  through  a  better  competition  policy, \nregulatory  efficiency,  and  competitive  trade  logistics;  (ii)  strengthening  the  market  for \ninfrastructure projects through PPPs; and (iii) promoting competitive labor markets to overcome \n\n                                                \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management\u2013Investment Climate (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n3  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nstructural  weaknesses  and  generate  employment.  The  program  includes  a  set  of  high-impact \nstructural  policy  reforms  (such  as  competition  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  tax  reform) \ndesigned to potentially benefit all sectors. It also includes a package of deeper structural policy \nreforms and assistance to specific leading sectors such as tourism, logistics, and infrastructure. \nThe  tourism  sector  was  selected  at  the  onset  of  the  program  in  response  to  private  sector \ndemand for  structural  reforms  to  specific  sectors  that  hold  promise  for  further  lifting  economic \ngrowth and job creation in an inclusive manner.5 \n \nSubprogram  2  includes  two  innovative  pilot  projects  that  apply  policy  in  practice,  with \n10. \nclearly defined and measurable performance indicators. The two pilot projects are supported by \ntwo  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  financed  by  the  Government  of  Canada  to  the \namount  of  Can$12.5  million.6 Each  pilot  project  is  subject  to  an  impact  evaluation  to  provide \nevidence  prior  to  a  nationwide  rollout  of  these  programs.  The  first  intervention  is  the  youth \nemployment  program  known  as  JobStart  Philippines.  Drawing  on  successful  models  in  Latin \nAmerica,  Canada,  and  Europe,  JobStart  provides  job  placement  assistance  to  young  people. \nJobStart is currently being piloted in four local government units and helps 1,600 out-of-school \nyouths to find quality jobs. The second innovative intervention is the tourism skills development \nprogram,  a  PPP  between  the  Department  of  Tourism  (DOT),  employers,  and  industry  groups, \nand  is  being  piloted  in  Bohol,  Cebu,  Davao,  and  Palawan,  which  are  fast-growing  tourism \ndestinations.  The  tourism  skills  development  program  includes  a  grants  scheme  whereby \nemployers can avail of grants to train workers so as to upgrade skills and services. \n \n11. \nSubprogram  2  has  been  jointly  formulated  by  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  and \nADB,  with  input  into  outputs  1  and  2  of  the  policy  matrix  from  the  Government  of  Japan  and \ninputs into output 3 by the Government of Canada. The government, through the Department of \nFinance  (DOF),  has  coordinated  the  reform  agenda  with  other  development  partners \nparticipating  in  the  program  policy  forum  (the  governments  of  Canada,  France,  and  Japan) \nthrough the program steering committee.7\n \n \n12. \nDuring  implementation  of  subprogram  2,  the  government  and  ADB  agreed  to  shift  two \noriginal  policy  triggers  to  the  post-program  partnership  framework  (P3F)  (para.  30)  without \nmaterially  affecting  the  program\u2019s  impact  and  outcome.  One  new  policy  trigger  was  added  to \nsubprogram 2. The first policy trigger shifted to the P3F required the government to approve the \nports utilization plan designed to decongest container traffic at the Port of Manila and enhance \nport  sales  in  the  Subic  Bay  Freeport  and  the  Port  of  Batangas.  While  the  Philippines  Port \nAuthority  (PPA)  had  drafted  a  plan  and  submitted  it  to  the  National  Economic  Development \nAuthority  (NEDA)  board  for  approval,  the  NEDA  board  referred  the  plan  back  for  further \nrevisions,  especially  in  light  of  the  2014  truck  ban  that  exacerbated  congestion  at  the  Port  of \nManila. The revised draft plan is expected to be resubmitted to NEDA in early 2015. This policy \ntrigger  is  shifted  to  the  P3F  and  is  replaced  in  subprogram  2  with  the  government\u2019s  interim \nmeasure to decongest the Manila container port (para. 19). The second policy trigger shifted to \nthe  P3F  required  the  government  to  provide  budgetary  financing  for  the  tourism  skills \ndevelopment program upon completion of the tourism skills pilot funded under ADB\u2019s TA. This \npolicy  trigger  has  been  shifted  to  the  P3F  because  the  pilot  will  be  completed  at  the  end  of \n2015.  The  government  is  committed  to  rolling  out  the  skills  development  program  financed \nthrough the national government budget for the fiscal year 2016 (para. 28). \n                                                \n5  Joint Foreign Chambers. 2010.

The  benchmark  will  be \nprogress made in key global competitiveness indicators. The growth inclusiveness element of a \nbetter  investment  climate  is  measured  by  the  expansion  in  the  number  of  young  people \nemployed in full-time wage jobs. The outcome of the program will be improved competitiveness \nof selected sectors such as tourism and infrastructure. An update of the performance indicators \nshows  substantial  progress  in  key  global  competitiveness  indicators  (para.  7)  and  a  moderate \npickup in young people employed in full-time wage jobs (para. 4). \n \nC. \n \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  competitiveness  and \n14. \ninclusiveness with three outputs: (i) implementing structural policy reforms to the economy, (ii) \nstrengthening  the  market  for  infrastructure  projects  through  PPPs,  and  (iii)  promoting \ncompetitive labor markets. All 22 policy measures (14 policy triggers and 8 milestones) required \nfor subprogram 2 have been accomplished. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Implementing Structural Policy Reforms to the Economy \n\n \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  government  in  advancing  its  competition  policy  and \n15. \nmeasures  to  promote  competitive  trade.  These  measures  build  on  reforms  completed  under \nsubprogram 1, which included the start of regulatory impact assessment (RIA) pilot projects at \nDOT and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), an \u201copen skies\u201d policy, and initial \nreforms to value-added tax (VAT) refunds. \n \n16. \nEnhancing  competition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency.  The  government  has \nimplemented reforms to develop a robust competition policy framework over the longer term. Its \napproach  has  three  pillars:  (i)  develop  a  competition  policy  law,  (ii)  institutionalize  RIAs  in \ngovernment,  and  (iii)  undertake  sector-by-sector  competition  and  regulatory  reforms.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  following  measures  were  accomplished  to  advance  this  agenda.  First,  the \ngovernment, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), established the Office for Competition at \nDOJ  with  17  staff  and  a  2014  budget  of  P10  million.  It  continued  capacity  development  with \nassistance  from  the  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency). The Office of Competition has also carried out substantial interagency coordination by \nestablishing five sector working groups and the Sector Regulators Council. Up to mid-2014, the \noffice  has  received  21  complaints  of  anticompetitive  practices,  of  which  7  have  been  resolved \nand the other 14 are ongoing. A main function of the office is to issue advisory opinions, and it \nhas issued two: on airline tickets sales promotions and on supermarkets. \n \nSecond,  NEDA  has  established  a  new  division  called  Governance  Staff.  Governance \n17. \nStaff  will  be  responsible  for  championing  the  practice  of  RIA  in  government  and  providing \ncapacity development to line ministries. NEDA is preparing the legal basis for implementing the \npractice of RIA in the executive government during the P3F period. Third, DOLE and DOT are \npiloting  RIAs  in  their  departments  with  ADB  assistance  to  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  a \nsystematic  approach  to reviewing  regulations.  Both  departments  endorsed  RIA  work  plans  for \n2013 and 2014. Substantial capacity development of staff in both departments has been carried \nout since 2012. Consequently, DOT has accomplished reviews of three regulations in the sector \nand  DOLE  has  accomplished  reviews  of  eight  regulations  and  programs,  such  as  security  of \ntenure  regulations,  foreign  worker  permits,  and  apprenticeship  law.  The  RIAs  provide \nrecommendations and some are being used as inputs for preparing longer-term reforms in both \n\n\f5 \n\nsectors.  DOT  has  also  begun  to  implement  RIA  in  two  attached  agencies  with  important \nregulatory  powers  in  the  sector:  the  Philippine  Retirement  Authority  and  the  Scuba  Diving \nCommission. Both departments will continue implementing RIA during the P3F period in support \nof the national rollout of RIA in government. DOLE has also established an e-regulation portal \nfor public consultation on regulations, which is expected to be launched at the end of 2014. \n \n18. \nPromoting  competitive  trade  logistics.  A  major  reform  to  the  logistics  market  is  the \ngovernment\u2019s  \u201copen  skies\u201d  policy.  In  June  2013,  Congress  enacted  Republic  Act  10378 \nabolishing the common carrier tax (CCT) of 3.0% on foreign airlines\u2019 passenger revenues. The \nCCT was considered a major tax distortion on foreign airlines and prevented equal treatment of \ndomestic  and  foreign  carriers  in  the  domestic  aviation  market.  The  new  law  also  exempts \nforeign  airlines  from  the  Gross  Philippine  Billings  Tax  (GPBT)  of  2.5%  on  gross  passenger \nrevenues  on  the  basis  of  reciprocity  with  other  countries.  This  reform  has  now  aligned  the \nPhilippines\u2019  aviation  sector  with  neighboring  economies  and  will  boost  the  competitiveness  of \nthe logistics market and benefit a wide range of industries. \n \nCongestion at the Port of Manila and the underutilization of the Subic Bay Freeport and \n19. \nthe Port of Batangas have resulted in lengthy delays in port clearance at the Port of Manila. A \ntruck  ban  in  Manila  from  February  to  September  2014  exacerbated  the  problem.  The \ngovernment  has  responded  in  two  ways.  First,  as  an  interim  measure,  it  issued  Presidential \nExecutive  Order  172  (dated  13  September  2014)  to  give  the  PPA  the  authority  to  redirect \ncontainer traffic from the Port of Manila to the Subic Bay Freeport and the Port of Batangas. The \nsecond measure is for the PPA to draft a port utilization plan with measures to make better use \nof  the  Subic  and  Batangas  ports  and  thereby  decongest  the  Manila  port.  The  plan  will  be \nsubmitted to NEDA for approval in early 2015 and implemented during the P3F period. \n \n20. \nAnother  major  reform  benefiting  exporters  of  goods  and  services  is  the  reform  to  VAT \nrefunds  for  enterprises.  Until  2011,  enterprises received  tax  credit  certificates  (TCCs)  for  VAT \nrefunds,  instead  of  cash  refunds  commonly  used  elsewhere  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  TCC \napproach  tied  up  the  working  capital  of  firms  and  thereby  significantly  raised  their  cost  of \nworking capital. Under subprogram 2, the government issued Presidential Executive Order 68-A \nto replace TCCs with cash refunds and direct the encashment of existing TCCs. However, very \nfew cash refunds have been provided to exporters due to a cumbersome refund administration \nprocess at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). In response and to support implementation of \nthe  executive  order,  the  BIR  issued  in  June  2014  Circular  52-2014,  which  lays  out  a  more \nconvenient process and administration of claims for VAT refunds consistent with the provisions \nof the National Internal Revenue Code. Finally, to fund the VAT cash refunds and conversion, \nthe 2014 General Appropriations Act (GAA) allocated P8.8 billion to BIR and P6.5 billion to the \nBureau of Customs. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput  2:  Strengthening  the  Market  for  Infrastructure  Projects  through \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships \n\n \n21. \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  government  in  creating  a  world-class  PPP  framework  for \nin \ninfrastructure  projects  as  one \ninfrastructure.

The  PPPC  continues  to  be  the  implementing  agency  for  PPP  policy  and \nactivities. 8  Regulations  related  to  PPPs  have  also  been  reviewed  and  improved  under \nsubprogram  2.  For  example,  the  PPPC  completed  a  review  of  all  PPP-related  legislation  and \nrecommended  amendments  to  the  Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer  Law  to  harmonize  with  the  PPP \nframework. With ADB technical assistance funded by the governments of Australia and Canada, \nsubstantial  efforts  have  been  made  to  boost  the  government\u2019s  capacity  for  PPPs  with  195 \ngovernment  staff  (56%  of  them  women)  received  training  on  the  relevant  policy  and  legal \nframework, operating manuals,  preparation of feasibility studies, bidding and transactions, and \nother  PPP-related  matters. 9  The  government  (through  NEDA  and  the  PPPC)  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  agreement  with  the  University  of  New  South Wales,  Australia,  to  establish  a \ntwinning partnership in PPPs as a vehicle for knowledge sharing and capacity development. \n \n23. \nEstablishing  long-term  financing  and  risk  guarantee  mechanisms  for  PPPs  in \ninfrastructure.  The  government  (through  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management) \nallocated in the 2013 GAA P8.1 billion to the Strategic Support Fund for sustainable financing of \nthe government\u2019s share in PPPs. The funds will be used for PPP projects of the Department of \nPublic  Works  and  Highways,  and  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communications. \nAnother P20 billion was allocated in the 2014 GAA to cover contingent liabilities that might arise \nfrom PPPs in 2014. \n \n24. \nreforms  and  capacity  development  activities  have  produced  concrete, \nmeasureable results. Sixteen project feasibility studies have been prepared with the support of \nthe  PDMF  and  with  completed  gender-responsive  checklists.  As  of  6  November  2014,  eight \nPPP  projects  had  awarded  contracts  with  estimated  project  costs  amounting  to  P127  billion, \namong  them  the  LTR  line  1  Cavite  Extension  (P64.9  billion),  the  Mactan\u2013Cebu  international \nairport  passenger  terminal  (P17.5  billion),  the  school  infrastructure  project  (P16.3 billion),  and \nthe  NAIA  expressway  (P15.5  billion).  Another  PPP  in  road  construction  (P35.5  billion)  has \nbidding  ongoing,  and  six  more  (P172.4  billion)  are  tendering  for  bid  submission  (footnote  8). \nSeveral of these projects are related to tourism infrastructure such as new airports or terminals \nin Bohol, Cebu, and other destinations in line with the DOT\u2019s tourism development plan. \n \n\nThese \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Promoting Competitive Labor Markets \n\n \n25. \nSubprogram  2  supports  the  government  in  implementing  measures  and  programs  to \nimprove  youth  employment,  improve  skills  development  in  the  workplace,  and  remove  other \nstructural  rigidities  in  the  labor  market  with  the  aim  of  stimulating  job  growth.  These  reforms \nbuild  on  subprogram  1,  which  included  the  endorsement  of  the  tourism  development  plan, \nissuance  of  new  hotel  and  resort  standards,  and  capacity  development  activities  at  the  public \nemployment service offices (PESOs). \n \n26. \nImproving  labor  market  information  and  employment  intermediation  systems\u2014\nJobStart Philippines. The government is addressing the problem of the high youth NEET rate \nwith its JobStart Philippines program.

Young people \nbetween 18 and 24 years of age with at least high school education and less than 12 months of \nwork experience are eligible to participate. By the end of October 2014, 1,600 eligible persons \nhad been randomly selected into the program and had completed career guidance and life skills \ntraining, and are now being referred to employers for internships. The pilot program is expected \nto  end  in June  2015,  when  all  beneficiaries  have finished  their  internships. Of those,  56%  are \nyoung  women,  68%  had  completed  high  school  education  (including  some  college  dropouts), \nand  32%  had  completed  college  or  had  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nqualification. Partnering with ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department, a sex-disaggregated \nrandomized impact evaluation has been adopted that will allow a rigorous evaluation of JobStart \nservices\u2019 effect on the employment performance of the young.10 Some 4,300 young people are \nparticipating  in  the  evaluation.  The  results  of  the  evaluation  will  guide  DOLE  on  a  nationwide \nrollout of JobStart. \n \n27. \nIn addition to JobStart, the government (through DOLE) continued capacity development \nat  selected  PESOs  for  effective  service  delivery  at  the  LGU  level  by  (i)  designing  a  gender-\nsensitive  manual  for  career  guidance  and  disseminating  career  guidance  modules  in  the  pilot \nPESO,  and  (ii)  developing  a  labor  market  information  system  action  plan  and  beginning  to \nimplement it in the four JobStart pilot LGUs. \n \nPromoting  industry-led  skills  and  service  standards  in  tourism.  Employers  in \n28. \nseveral sectors complain about the skills mismatch of many high school and college graduates \nand the emerging shortage of skilled workers. The government recognizes these constraints on \ncompetitiveness  and  employment  and  is  trying  to  solve  them  through  both  crosscutting \ninterventions  and  sector-specific  programs.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  (through \nDOT) piloted a PPP with employers, known as the tourism skills development program, which is \nan employer-led initiative. Under the program, employers were awarded 25 grants in May 2014 \nto train about 4,300 workers in four locations at an average training cost of P8,000 per worker. \nAbout 46% of the trainees are women, which is below the program\u2019s target of 55%. Incentives \nwill be introduced to increase the share of women in phase 2 of the grant awards (in 2015); for \nexample,  additional  points  will  be  awarded to  applications  meeting  the gender  target.  Training \nprograms under phase 1 are currently being implemented. The grantees include high-end hotels \nand  resorts  partnered  with  smaller  hotels,  community-based  tourism  enterprises,  tour  guide \nassociations,  and  tour  operators.  DOT  intends  to  fund  the  skills  program  through  the  national \ngovernment  budget  in  2016.  The skills  grant  scheme  is  being  complemented  by  the  new  five-\nstar  rating  scheme  designed  to  promote  service  standards  in  hotels  and  resorts.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  third-party  international  and  national  assessors  were  engaged  to  assist  with \nquality audits of hotels and resorts under the new rating system. The audits covered 693 hotels \nand  resorts  nationwide,  of  which  141  hotels  and  resorts  are  in  the  four  pilot  areas  of  Bohol, \nCebu, Davao, and Palawan and were assessed with TA support from ADB and the Government \nof Canada. Ratings should be announced in the fourth quarter of 2014. \n \n29. \nStrengthening employment policies and programs. The government initiated actions \nto improve labor and employment policies and programs with the aim of generating employment \nand  improving  access  to  decent  jobs.  This  included  the  following:  (i)  DOLE  completed \npreliminary  impact  assessments  on  selected  employment  programs  such  as  the  Special \nProgram  for  Employment  of  Poor  Students  and  the  apprenticeship  program,  and  made \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

The program has also defined in detail the P3F \nactivities  that  will  sustain  future  reforms  beyond  subprogram  2,  especially  regarding  youth \nemployment,  PPPs  for  infrastructure,  and  regulatory  reform  through  RIA.  Thirteen  policy \nmeasures  are  included  in  the  P3F,  covering  November  2014\u2013March  2016  and  providing  the \nbuilding  blocks  for  the  next  generation  of  possible  policy-based  loans  and  projects,  e.g.,  for \ninfrastructure improvement in 2016, enhancement of rural enterprises and rural employment in \n2016, and improvements to the school\u2013work transition of young people in 2017. \n \nD. \n \nTo support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a  single-tranche loan of \n31. \n$350,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  of  the \nprogrammatic approach. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \n(30%  annuity  amortization  method);  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 12.1 years and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nforeign  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports listed in the negative list attached \nto  the  loan  agreement.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,13 the proceeds of the \npolicy-based loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the borrower. \n \n32. \nThe size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand the weight of the benefits of the reform program (para. 35), (ii) the need to conform to the \noverall  financing  requirement  of  the  country  partnership  strategy  period,  and  (iii)  development \nexpenditure  supported  by  the  reform  program.14 The  government\u2019s  net  development  financing \nneeds  are  P266  billion  for  2014,  to  which  overseas  development  assistance  loans  contributes \nP52  billion.

The \ngovernment  requested  multiple  installments  to  ensure  efficient  cash-flow  management  by \nminimizing  (i)  the  incidence  of  negative  carry  that  may  occur  due  to  a  potential  mismatch  in \ntiming between disbursement of the full loan amount and its full utilization; and (ii) the burden of \nfull  financing  charges  that  would  arise  due  to  higher  interest  payments  payable  on  a  fully \ndisbursed  loan,  as  compared  with  lower  commitment  charges  payable  on  a  loan  disbursed  in \ntwo installments. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nSubprogram  2  covers  October  2012\u2013October  2014.

DOF  is  the  executing  agency  for  the  program  and  is  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of subprogram 2, P3F and the medium-term results framework and coordination \namong  the  implementing  agencies.

These  economic  benefits  arise  from  lower  costs  of  trade  logistics,  an  improved \ncompetition  policy,  and  increased  investment  in  infrastructure.  The  reform  costs  to  the \ngovernment  and  the  private  sector  are  conservatively  estimated  at  $838.2  million  discounted \nover the program\u2019s medium-term period. These costs include the administrative and fiscal costs \nto  the  government  in  implementing  the  reforms  and  direct  budgetary  funding  of  the  Strategic \nSupport Fund and the PDMF (footnote 14). \n \nB. \n \n36. \nImproved  governance  and  anticorruption  efforts  are  core  priorities  of  the  government. \nThe  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  (PFM)  reform  roadmap  was  announced  in \nFebruary 2011, and it includes a series of short- to medium-term reforms building on previous \naccomplishments  made  since  2006.  The  reforms  address  PFM  risks  related  to  budget \ncredibility,  weak  government  internal  audit,  and  inefficient  procurement  system,  among  other \nrisks.15 The  plan  is  supported  by  development  partners.  ADB  has  supported  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms  since  2006,  starting  with  its  Development  Policy  Support  Program  loan \ncompleted in 2009.16 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n37. \nSubprogram  2  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.

Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  program.  The  government  agreed  to  cooperate,  and  shall  cause  any  and  all \ngovernment  offices,  organizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to \ncooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including \nproviding  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  may  be  necessary,  for  the  satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. \n \nE. \n \nOverall  the risks  to the program  are rated from  low  to medium  and  are expected  to be \n39. \noutweighed by the program impact and benefits (footnote 15). The two main political economy \nrisks  to  the  program  are  weak  interagency  coordination  and  the  reform  agenda  remaining \nsensitive  to  political  interests.  The  program  includes  mitigating  measures.  TA  is  provided  to \nsupport capacity development and interagency coordination on key reforms, including signing of \nmemorandums  of  understanding  between  DOLE  and  the  mayors  of  four  LGUs.
