I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Project (Phase 2).  \n \n2.  The project will adopt a community-driven development (CDD) approach and provide direct \nsupport to slum communities in 20 cities to upgrade basic infrastructure and establish new housing \nsites. About 670,000 low-income families will benefit from improved access to social services and \nessential infrastructure.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia is one of the fastest urbanizing countries in Asia. Currently, about half of the \npopulation (51%) lives in cities; this is projected to increase to 68% by 2025. Many of the growing \ncities are having difficulty coping with the rapid increase of in-migrants seeking new economic \nopportunities. They are forced to settle in disadvantaged neighborhoods due to limited financial \nresources, lack of affordable adequate housing, and/or failure to find well-paid jobs.2 In 2011, about \n12.5% of the urban population was forced to live in slum areas.3 The project will demonstrate an \nintegrated  approach  to  upgrade  slum  neighborhoods  by  (i)  providing  resources  directly  to \ndisadvantaged communities to improve their living conditions; (ii) establishing new settlements for \npoor  families;  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  capacity  development  component,  assisting  local \nadministrations in managing pro-poor urban development including the development of multisector \nstrategies to address urban poverty issues beyond infrastructure upgrading.  \n \n4.  Better public infrastructure is considered vital to sustain inclusive economic growth and \nstimulate  economic  opportunities  for  the  growing  urban  population.  Yet  infrastructure \nimprovements have not kept up with the rapid urbanization; infrastructure investment has lagged \neconomic development. Most infrastructure and public services in poor neighborhoods do not meet \nthe needs of the increasing number of inhabitants. Environmental and social problems related to \naccessibility  to  adequate  services for  people\u2019s  daily  needs  are  increasing  due  to  widespread \nconstraints in the provision of clean water; insufficient sanitation facilities; deteriorating roads, \npathways, and drainage; ineffective flood control; lack of constant power supply; and poor solid \nwaste management. Only about 40% of the urban population has access to safe water; about 28% \ndoes not have access to improved sanitation facilities. About 35% of urban areas lack proper \ndrainage systems. To meet local needs the project will provide grants to slum communities for \nupgrading basic infrastructure including improving sanitation facilities and access to safe water. \n \n5.  Problems  are  aggravated  by  the  absence  of  sound  land  use  planning  and  land \nmanagement regulations that are contributing to increased congestion and haphazard informal \ndevelopment.  A  multifaceted  approach  is  required  to  address  these  challenges,  including \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  city  administrations  to  manage  urban  development  in  an \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable manner; modernizing land policies and permit regulations; \nexpanding  access  to,  and  targeting  of,  housing finance  and  subsidies;  increasing  community \ninvolvement in spatial planning; and engaging the private sector in development planning. Rapid \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Overall poverty incidence in Indonesia fell to 12% in 2012; the national urban poverty rate was estimated at 9.1%. \n3  The official government publication, Report on the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Indonesia \n2011, states that 12.57% of the urban population was living in slums. ", "2 \nurbanization has triggered growing demand for housing; the availability of affordable housing in \ncities for low-income groups appears to be declining.4 \n \n6.  The National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2010\u20132015 (RPJMN) identifies insufficient \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  as  one  cause  of  poverty.  Thus  improving  basic  infrastructure  is \nconsidered  an  effective  catalyst  to  reduce  poverty  and  close  gaps  in  income  inequality  in \ndisadvantaged  urban  neighborhoods.  While  Indonesia  has  generally  made  good  progress  in \naccelerating achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the MDG targets for \nachieving significant improvement in the lives of slum dwellers (MDG target 7D) and halving the \nproportion  of  urban  households  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic \nsanitation (MDG target 7C) need special attention.5 The project, which aims to upgrade basic \npublic infrastructure in slums, will contribute to meeting both MDG targets. To address issues of the \nrapid urbanization, the government launched the Cities without Slums Program6 and issued Law \nNo. 1, 2011, Housing and Settlement Areas.7 To contribute to the Cities without Slums Program, \nthe government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare and partly finance the \nNeighborhood  Upgrading  and  Shelter  Project  (Phase  2)  to  help  20  cities  improve  basic \ninfrastructure and living conditions in selected slums.8 \n \n7.  The project builds on lessons from the government's foremost poverty reduction program, the \nNational Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which adopts a CDD approach \nand provides nationwide assistance for improving essential social services and basic infrastructure \nby providing block grants to poor communities.9 Addressing poverty issues and basic infrastructure \nneeds  through  CDD  is  considered  more  effective,  sustainable,  and  equitable  than  use  of \ncentralized arrangements, as communities become active partners in development. The CDD \napproach  adopted  under  the  PNPM  gives  communities  control  over  planning  decisions  and \ninvestment resources, and focuses on community empowerment to improve basic infrastructure \nand service delivery. Community participatory planning and design of specific investments is a key \nfeature. The community controls resources; hence funds are transferred directly to community-\nmanaged bank accounts. The community also manages project implementation supported by \nconsultants and facilitators when required. The CDD process is designed to systematically mobilize \nthe capacity of communities to prioritize their development needs, design activities, seek technical \nassistance, manage resources, and implement and sustain development actions.10 Building on \n                                                \n4  According to World Bank estimates published in the Indonesia Economic Quarterly Report (March 2013), 600,000\u2013 \n900,000 housing units are required per year. The number increases as urbanization continues: 700,000\u20131,000,000 \nhousing units are estimated to be needed per year during 2014\u20132021. \n5  The 2015 MDG target for the proportion of the urban population living in slums is 6%; in 2011, 12.6% of the urban \npopulation lived in slums. The 2015 MDG target for the proportion of households with sustainable access to an \nimproved water source is 75.5%; in 2011, 40.5% of urban households had access to an improved water source, 72.5% \nhad access to basic sanitation. The proportion of households with access to safe water and basic sanitation in slum \nareas is assumed to be much lower. \n6  The Cities without Slums Program is incorporated in the National Long-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132025. It aims to \nreduce slum areas in cities by 2025 by promoting concerted initiatives by the central and local governments, private \nsector, and civil society. \n7  The law specifies the roles and responsibilities of central and local governments for providing housing and settlements, \nincluding housing for the poor, and upgrading slum areas. \n8  Relevance of the project is discussed in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Urban Infrastructure (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  PNPM Mandiri was launched in 2007. The RPJM, 2010\u20132014 includes PNPM Mandiri as a development tool to \naccelerate poverty alleviation with an indicative budget allocation of $6,754 million over 5 years. \n10  Encouraged by the success of the PNPM scheme, three ADB-financed infrastructure improvement projects were \naligned with the PNPM using the project loan modality and adopting a CDD approach: (i) ADB. 2008. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Rural \nInfrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. Manila; (ii) ADB. 2009.

Manila; and (iii) ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan and Administration of Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the Urban \nSanitation and Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project. Manila. \n ", "3 \nlessons of the overall PNPM program and the latest ADB-financed CDD projects, the proposed \nADB project will follow a similar CDD approach.11 \n \n8.  The project builds on lessons from (i) the first Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject;12 (ii) the first and second Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Projects, and \n(iii) the ongoing Urban Sanitation and Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project \n(footnote 10). The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been implementing the projects. Lessons \nincorporated  into  the  project  design  include  (i)  involve  beneficiaries  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation of neighborhood upgrading, (ii) support development of strong political commitment \nto support pro-poor urban development, (iii) promote integrated development approaches and link \nupgrading  investments  of  individual  communities  with  overall  city  development  planning,  (iv) \nreduce the number of project cities and neighborhoods to lessen transaction costs in project \nmanagement, (v) increase the investment amount per neighborhood to boost means for improving \nliving conditions in slums, (vi) provide transparent fund flow and implementation mechanisms, and \npromote  community  control  of  decision-making  over  resources  and  investment  choices;  (vii) \ndevelop strong accountability procedures, such as public disclosure of budgets and contracts; and \n(viii) establish effective mechanisms for operation and maintenance (O&M) of infrastructure.13 The \nproject is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014 for Indonesia and will \ncontribute to achievement of the targets of the results framework of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2012\u20132014 for Indonesia and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.14 The country partnership strategy \nincludes support for government efforts to achieve more inclusive growth by improving basic \ninfrastructure for poor communities in selected cities. The project is aligned with ADB's Urban \nOperational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  as  it  (i)  provides  support to  urban  shelter sector  programs;  (ii) \ncontributes to upgrading of local infrastructure in the four core areas of water supply, sanitation, \nwater  management,  and  urban  transport;  and  (iii)  improves  community  services,  employment \nopportunities, and livelihood development.15  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be improved living conditions in urban areas. The outcome will \nbe improved infrastructure and access to service delivery in slum neighborhoods in 20 cities.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have three outputs: (i) institutional capacity for managing pro-poor urban \ndevelopment  strengthened;  (ii)  infrastructure  in  slum  neighborhoods  upgraded;  and  (iii)  new \nsettlements for poor families established.  \n \n                                                \n11  The project loan modality was applied as the project is limited to providing targeted support to improve basic \ninfrastructure in slum neighborhoods of 20 cities, adopts a CDD approach, and does not address overall policy issues \nor legal and regulatory frameworks, which would require involving other line ministries and government agencies. \n12  ADB. 2003.

The project closed in December \n2010 and is rated successful. ADB. 2011. Completion Report: Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project in \nIndonesia. Manila. \n13 In addition to ADB, other development partners have had a long-standing engagement with Indonesia in infrastructure \ndevelopment. In 1999, the WB started the financing of the Urban Poverty Project, which aimed at reducing urban \npoverty by increasing income of the urban poor, empower urban communities and improve local government capacity \nto assist the urban poor. The UPP has created momentum for addressing poverty issues and basic infrastructure \nneeds through CDD, which was further developed under the Government\u2019s PNPM scheme. An overview on the \ndevelopment cooperation related to urban infrastructure is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 6. \n14  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n15  The project will contribute to inclusive development, planning, and governance through capacity building support \nprovided under output 1 and adoption of a CDD approach.  \n ", "4 \n11.  Institutional capacity for managing pro-poor urban development strengthened. The \nproject will provide capacity building assistance to local administrations in the project cities for  \n(i)  community-driven  settlement  upgrading  and  new  site  development  (NSD);  (ii)  building \ncommunity member awareness on sanitation and hygiene; (iii) project management; (iv) public\u2013\nprivate partnerships for NSD, with special focus on the poor; and (v) O&M of upgraded facilities \nand NSD through community-based efforts. Within the first year of project implementation and with \nthe help of consultants, each participating city will conduct a capacity assessment identifying \nchallenges  and  capacity  building  needs  to  strengthen  spatial  planning  and  pro-poor  urban \ndevelopment. Based on the results of the assessments, city administrations will prepare capacity \nbuilding  and  training  proposals,  which  will  be  consolidated  by  MPW\u2019s  Directorate General  of \nHuman Settlements (DGHS), the executing agency. DGHS will facilitate joint training and study \nprograms,  and  other  capacity  building  assistance  for  selected  staff  from  the  20  local \nadministrations.  To  address  poverty  issues  beyond  infrastructure  upgrading,  the  project  will \nsupport the preparation of multisector slum improvement action plans. The plans will represent an \nattempt to combine physical environmental improvements with other support mechanisms that will \nrequire collective efforts from entities beyond MPW. \n \n12.  Infrastructure in slum neighborhoods upgraded. About $60 million of the loan proceeds \nwill be allocated for upgrading basic infrastructure in slum neighborhoods in 20 cities. Participating \ncities have been preliminarily selected based on the following criteria: (i) local governments have \napproved spatial plans (RTRWs) and development strategies (SPPIPs) that identify slum areas \nand provide guidance to improve slums; (ii) at least 5,000 households live in slum areas; (iii) at \nleast 5% of households located in slum neighborhoods fall in the category of extreme poor;16 (iv) \nformal confirmation of the local government to participate in the project; and (v) confirmation that \nhouseholds without legal title to the land (informal dwellers) in the selected slum neighborhoods \nwould be allowed to participate in and benefit from the project.17 \n \n13.  To be selected to participate in the project, local governments of the project cities will sign a \nmemorandum of agreement with DGHS validating their readiness and contributions, including (i) \nestablishing a local coordination office (LCO) with experienced and committed staff; (ii) providing \nadditional resources to finance complementary infrastructure works and to improve public services \nin slum areas; (iii) ensuring compliance to adopt a CDD approach to identify the specific type and \nmix of interventions to be financed by the project based on needs assessments carried out by the \ncommunities; and (iv) adjusting and/or revising spatial plans and development strategies based on \nfeedback received during the consultation process with slum communities.  \n \n14.  Project funds will be allocated for each city based on the number of slums: (i) cities with \nmore than 100 slums will receive up to $4.5 million; (ii) cities with 50\u2013100 slums will receive up to \n$3.5 million; and (iii) cities with less than 50 slums will receive up to $2.4 million. Funding for \ninfrastructure upgrading investments provided to each slum will vary and depend on the actual \nsituation and needs of the communities. \n \n15.  City administrations will identify the specific slum neighborhoods to be supported by the \nproject based on a close consultation process with slum communities and agreed selection criteria. \nThe final list of project slum neighborhoods will be confirmed by a bupati (mayor) decree and \n                                                \n16 Households living on a monthly income of less than Rp2.2 million are considered extreme poor. \n17  During project preparation, 50 cities were considered eligible to participate in the project based on the precondition \ncriteria. During a thorough consultation process between DGHS and the candidate cities, which included field visits to \nexplain the project scope and CDD approach to the city administrations and community groups, 20 cities confirmed \ntheir commitment to participate in the project. Based on lessons from earlier CDD infrastructure projects executed by \nMPW, the formal commitment of the city administration to participate in and contribute to project implementation and \nspecify resources is considered crucial. The preliminary list of project cities includes Ambon, Batam, Bandar Lampung, \nBanjarmasin, Bengkulu, Bima, Bone, Kapuas, Kendari, Makassar, Palangkaraya, Palembang, Palopo, Pasuruan, \nPekalongan, Semarang, Serang, Sukabumi, Tanjung Jabung Barat, Tanjung Balai. \n ", "5 \nsubmitted to ADB by DGHS for endorsement within 3 months after loan effectiveness. The process \nof engaging with slum communities will start with road shows in each project city to inform potential \nslum communities of the project scope and approach, and the selection criteria to be eligible for \nparticipation in the project. Selection criteria are based on socioeconomic indicators, and the \nreadiness and commitment to participate in the project.18 Overall information on the project and the \nselection process will be publicly disclosed in each project city. Cities with more than 100 slum \nlocations will nominate at least 20 slum neighborhoods, but not more than 35; cities with 50 to 100 \nslum locations will nominate at least 15 slum neighborhoods, but not more than 20; and cities with \nless than 50 slum locations will nominate up to 15. \n \n16.  Each selected neighborhood will work through a community implementation organization \n(BKM). Supported by consultant teams, BKMs will facilitate infrastructure assessments for the slum \nneighborhoods, to be carried out by the community members, to assess basic infrastructure needs \nin the community; evaluate community implementation capacity; establish efficient planning and \ndecision-making  processes;  formulate  neighborhood  upgrading  plans  (NUAPs)  and  specific \nsubproject investment plans; prepare simple technical designs; organize works to be carried out by \nthe community members; and formulate O&M plans of completed project facilities.  \n \n17.  To achieve a wider development impact for cities and address infrastructure issues beyond \nthe boundaries of individual slum neighborhoods, LCOs with the help of consultants will establish a \nconsultation mechanism for project BKMs, and the city administration to formulate a consolidated \ninfrastructure upgrading investment plan, which will integrate the individual NUAPs. In the process \nof preparing the overall infrastructure upgrading investment plan, BKMs, and the city administration \nwill jointly evaluate NUAPs from each slum neighborhood, agree on collaboration to link upgrading \nactivities between neighborhoods, concur on fund allocations per neighborhood within the overall \ninvestment amount for the respective project city, and revise individual NUAPs to be aligned with \nthe  agreed  consolidated  infrastructure  upgrading  investment  plan  for  the  project  city.  The \nconsolidated city investment plans will be approved by DGHS and ADB and include the revised \nNUAPs with agreed investment amounts for each project slum neighborhood. The project will \nensure that the consultation process is conducted in a transparent and fair manner. During this \nconsultation process, BKMs, and city administrations will assess whether individual NUAPs are \naligned with spatial plans and development strategies at the city level and agree on any necessary \nadjustments. \n \n18.  Based on the complexity of infrastructure upgrading plans, civil works will be carried out by \nthe communities or by firms to be engaged by DGHS. Following the PNPM approach, funds for \nworks  implemented  by  communities  will  be  based  on  contracts  between  the  BKM,  and  city \nadministration19 and transferred through block grants directly from the project imprest account to \ncommunity bank account managed by the BKMs.20 Detailed guidance related to eligibility criteria \nand  procedures  to  use  grant  funds  will  be  explained  in  the  guidelines  (JUKLAK)  and \n                                                \n18  Selection criteria for the project neighborhoods include: (i) the neighborhood must be located in a participating city; (ii) \nformal confirmation of the head of the neighborhood or BKM verifying (a) interest and willingness to participate in the \nproject, (b) contribution to the planning and implementation of upgrading activities, (c) willingness to establish required \nO&M arrangements for facilities constructed by the project; and (iii) the neighborhood must be listed as a slum \nneighborhood in the applicable city development plan. \n19  Contracts will specify payment modalities. Detailed information on the fund flow mechanism and implementation of \nneighborhood upgrading plans is in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n20  No withdrawal from the imprest account will be made for civil works for output 2 until, among other things: (i) the \nseparate bank account for the BKM of the corresponding slum neighborhood has been opened, (ii) the consolidated \ninvestment plan of the corresponding participating town, integrating the NUAPs of project slum neighborhoods has \nbeen approved by ADB and DGHS, and (iii) a contract for the relevant subproject has been concluded between the \nBKM for the relevant slum neighborhood and the city administration. \n ", "6 \nimplementation manuals (JUKNIS) to be developed with the help of consultants and approved by \nDGHS at the beginning of the project.  \n  \n19.  New settlements for poor families established. A model of partnership for each NSD \nbetween  the  central  government,  local  administrations,  developers,  and  financial  institutions  to \nprovide housing for poor people will be developed. The project will take a catalytic role to develop \nexamples  for  replication  and  promote  public\u2013private  alliances  in  five  cities21 whereby:  (i)  local \ngovernments will provide land from their own resources and issue land titles for potential new house \nowners (titles are required as collateral to receive loans from financial institutions); (ii) MPW will \nprovide the basic infrastructure (roads, water and electricity supply, and sanitation facilities) financed \nby loan proceeds; (iii) private developers will prefinance the house construction, and coordinate \nconnections to the main networks of service providers (water and electricity); (iv) financial institutions \nwill provide loans to poor families to buy (or construct) new houses; (v) NGOs, in close cooperation \nwith the local administration, will organize socialization campaigns to explain the NSD scheme to \npoor families living in slum neighborhoods of the project city, develop transparent criteria to select \npoor beneficiary families to be eligible to apply under the NSD scheme, and facilitate the selection \nprocess. To establish the basic infrastructure for new settlements, the project will provide about $5.0 \nmillion to finance civil works. The legal title to the land of the NSD sites must be held in the name of \nthe participating cities. Within 18 months after loan effectiveness, the project cities will present a full \nNSD proposal, which is endorsed by the bupati (mayor), to ADB and DGHS for review and approval. \nThe  proposal  will  include  (i)  proof  of  land  ownership;  (ii)  detailed  technical  designs  with  cost \nestimates for infrastructure to be financed by the loan proceeds; (iii) basis for the selection of a local \ndeveloper; (iv) proposed loan schemes, including commitments from financial institutions to provide \nloans to poor families under the NSD scheme; and (v) a transparent selection process to identify \nslum  dwellers  prepared  to  buy  houses  at  the  NSD  site.  DGHS  will  ensure  that  the  houses \nconstructed  under  the project  will  not  be  sold  or resold  within  10  years  after  completion. The \nproposed NSD sites will be vacant and ready for infrastructure development, and will not be subject \nto environmental threats. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual (PAM). DGHS will be the executing agency. The project will be \nimplemented from July 2014 to December 2017. In each project city, a local project management \nunit will be established with experienced and qualified staff to facilitate project implementation. \nTheir tasks are described in detail in the PAM. All procurement financed under the ADB loan will be \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsultant  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2014\u2013December 2017 \nEstimated project completion date  31 December 2017 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Housing and Settlements Steering Committee \nMembers include BAPPENAS, MOF, MOHA, MPW, MPH, BPN, MOH \n(ii)   Executing agency  DGHS within MPW \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  DGHS and administrations of 20 city districts \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  Project management unit, DGHS, MPW, 5 staff  \nCity and district project management units in 20 participating cities and/or \ndistricts, 3\u20135 staff in each unit \nBlock grants for basic  Community  1,000 contracts  $41.0 million \ninfrastructure upgrading  procurement  \nComplex infrastructure upgrading  Procurement through  70 contracts  $24.0 million \nDGHS        \nConsulting services  2,297 person-months of national consultants  $9.4 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Four management consultant packages will be procured using advance \nadvance contracting  contracting, including the national project management consultant team \n(estimated contract amount $6,623,000).

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n23.  About  670,000  low-income  households  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  project.  The \nexpected  economic  benefits  are significant  and  include  (i)  improved  public  health  status  and \nreduced per capita costs for health care and medical treatment due to increased coverage of \nsanitation services, improved access to safe drinking water, and improved hygiene particularly in \ndensely  populated  neighborhoods;  (ii)  increased  income-generating  opportunities  through \nimproving  essential  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  considerable  short-term  employment  generation. \nImproving the overall living environments of poor urban neighborhoods where people are engaged \nin informal economic activities will enhance income-earning opportunities of small home industries, \nparticularly related to food processing, handicraft, batik, and small repair services. Upgrading roads \nand pathways, and improving water and power supply will improve the overall business conditions \nfor informal entrepreneurs (including food-stall owners, small restaurants, repair shops). Improved \nroads  will  also  provide  easier  and  safer  access  for  residents  to  reach  their  places  of  work. \nTransportation costs in general will be reduced to improve access to local markets to deliver goods \nand services and buy products, and to schools and health centers. Improving drainage systems will \ncontribute to reducing damage and losses due to flooding.22 \n \nB.  Governance \n24.  The  project  will  adopt  a  CDD  approach,  which  is  a  key  feature  of  instituting  good \ngovernance practices. It will strengthen the ability of communities to articulate their needs and to \nseek support for development plans; it will improve the ability of district governments to respond to \nthe  demands  of  poor  communities.  Evaluations  of  CDD  infrastructure  projects  suggest  that \ncommunity  choices  are  more  attuned  to  local  needs;  sustainable  O&M  is  more  likely  as \ninfrastructure projects chosen by the community members have a direct benefit. Participation in \nplanning and implementing infrastructure projects yields better oversight and less corruption, and \ncommunities become active partners in development. The project will ensure transparency to \nenable the community to know every aspect of the project decision-making process. Management \nof funds will be transparent and shared with the entire community. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. Within 3 months \nof loan effectiveness, DGHS will establish a project-specific website for public disclosure on use of \nthe loan proceeds, including details of procurement and contract awards.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The  project  will  target  poor  communities  in  slum  areas  that  lack  basic  services  and \ninfrastructure. The selected neighborhoods will have higher than average poverty rates and lower \nthan  average  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  Improvements  of  basic  infrastructure  will  increase \nincome-earning opportunities and accessibility to education and health services for the poor and \nnear  poor.  Improved  sanitation  and  cleaner  environments  resulting  from  project  activities  will \nreduce diseases linked to unsafe water and poor hygiene, thus contributing to improving the overall \nhealth status of the poor.23 The project will address the key gender issues, including (i) limited \nparticipation and leadership of women in local decision-making processes related to community \ninfrastructure investments; (ii) insufficient access of women to employment opportunities in local \ncivil and maintenance works; and (iii) inadequate opportunities for female government staff to \naccess technical training opportunities. The project\u2019s gender action plan includes (i) developing \nslum  improvement  action  plans  based  on the needs  of  women  and men for  public facilities;  \n(ii) ensuring women comprise 40% of participants in decision-making activities and 20% of BKM \n                                                \n22  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nmembers, in aggregate; (iii) undertaking gender audits of all community investment plans; (iv) \nproviding 20% of paid work created by the project to women; (v) ensuring women comprise 30% of \ntrainees  in  all  project  capacity  development  activities  and  30%  of  user  group  members;  (vi) \nproviding gender training to all key project stakeholders; and (vii) developing and using gender \nindicators to track implementation of the gender action plan and project outcomes for women.24 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n26.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The project will not include physical displacement; \nless than 10% of productive assets will be lost as a result of involuntary land acquisition. In the \ncontext of specific neighborhood upgrading activities, i.e., construction of public sanitation facilities, \nsmall amounts of land may be acquired from community members or donated voluntarily.25 The \nlegal title of the land for NSD will be in the name of the project city; the land will be vacant and \nready for implementation. As the scope of land acquisition is expected to be insignificant with no \nexpected resettlement, the project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement. Since \ncommunities  will  be  identifying  specific  interventions  during  project  implementation,  potential \nissues related to land acquisition can be identified only after the type of infrastructure upgrading \nand  the  specific  location  are  agreed  on.  A  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  provide \nguidance to communities on managing land acquisition.26 The NUAPs will record the potential for \nland acquisition. \n \n27.  Environment.  Overall,  the  infrastructure  upgrading  activities  are  expected  to  create \npositive impacts on the environment and improve the livelihoods at slum communities. The project \nis categorized as environment category B. Since it will use a CDD approach, communities will \nidentify the specific project locations and types of infrastructure interventions during the first year of \nimplementation. An environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to guide the \nenvironmental  assessment  process  to  screen  specific  infrastructure  interventions  and  set  up \ninstitutional arrangements in relation to environmental management and monitoring. Safeguard \nspecialists  and  trained  community  advisors,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  communities,  will \nconduct assessments in each project neighborhood in the process of preparing the NUAPs. 27 The \nNUAPs will record results of the environmental screening process. For the NSD under output 3, \ninitial environmental examinations will be prepared at each site after the project city has formally \nconfirmed its readiness to participate in the NSD component and designated the land for the \nproject. The report will be part of the NSD proposals to be approved by DGHS and ADB. NSD \nproposals without an initial environmental examination report will not be endorsed.  \n \n28.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  negative  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. It will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. Following \nCDD principles, the project will include opportunities for screening project impacts on indigenous \ngroups and incorporating mitigation measures, if any, into the consolidated city investment plans. \nIn accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified category C \nfor indigenous peoples.28  \n \n                                                \n24  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25  Community members will pay for land from their own resources; loan proceeds will not be used. \n26  Safeguard specialists will direct and supervise implementation of land acquisition by BKMs, and LCOs based on the \nresettlement framework, which has been disclosed (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  National and regional consultant teams will include environmental safeguard experts, who will guide communities and \nLCO to carry out environmental screening and supervise the process. The environmental assessment and review \nframework has been disclosed (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28  Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups will be part of the capacity-building, planning, implementation, and \npost-implementation processes; minority and marginalized groups will be represented on BKMs; and indigenous \ngroups will benefit from easier access to service delivery, rural infrastructure, training, and construction-related jobs. \n ", "10 \n29.  Operation and maintenance. To ensure sustainability of infrastructure investments, DGHS \nwill  ensure  that  O&M  arrangements  are  well  reflected  in  the  NUAPs.  The  O&M  of  facilities \nupgraded under output 2 will be managed through a community participatory approach, involving \nthe local BKM and beneficiary communities. In the preparation of the NUAPs, consultant teams will \nguide  communities  and  LCOs  to  understand  the  need  for  O&M  provisions  and  ensure  that \nappropriate technical and financial measures for O&M are included. BKMs, supervised by the city \nadministrations, will handle O&M of new sites under output 3. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  In the past, some CDD programs have bypassed local government planning procedures. \nThe project will mitigate this risk by facilitating a consultation process between BKMs and the city \nadministrations to jointly formulate consolidated investment plans and ensure that NUAPs are \naligned with spatial plans and development strategies. For the NSD, a potential risk involves \nsuccessfully engaging with private stakeholders to establish new housing sites for poor families. \nThis risk will be mitigated through targeted awareness campaigns to illustrate the mutual benefits \nfor all stakeholders. Project consultants will be engaged to facilitate dialog among developers, \nfinancial  institutions,  local  administrations,  and  community  members.  Previous  CDD  projects \nindicate a risk of \u201celite capture\u201d\u2014where wealthy and/or articulate, educated community members \ndominate decision-making processes. This risk will be mitigated by (i) using transparent processes \nin conducting needs assessments and preparing NUAPs; (ii) working through BKMs with elected \nrepresentative from the neighborhoods; and (iii) publicly displaying decision-making processes, \ntender documents, fund transfers, and progress of civil works. Experienced consultant teams will \nsupport communities in preparing technical designs and implementing civil works to ensure high \nquality  of  infrastructure  and  effective  O&M  arrangements.  DGHS  will  set  up  units  to  handle \ncomplaints at each project city that will review and address grievances from stakeholders.29  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n32.
