This document is based on the consultants\u2019 studies, surveys, and reports; the \nfindings  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  missions;  and  discussions  with  government \nagencies, stakeholders, beneficiaries, and development partners.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nPoverty  and  rural  development.  Although  national  economic  growth  has  been  at  an \nannual average of about 9% from 1991 to 2009, reducing poverty and increasing rural incomes \nremain daunting challenges in the PRC. In spite of this growth, the PRC continues to be a lower-\nmiddle-income  country  with  about  254  million  people  still  living  on  less  than  $1.25  per  day.3 \nUsing the PRC\u2019s official poverty line, there were about 40 million poor in the PRC in 2009; and \nthe  poverty  incidence  was  4.2%,  affecting  predominantly  rural  areas. 4  Income  inequalities \nbetween the eastern and western PRC have also risen, and the income gap between rural and \nurban households has widened considerably since the late 1970s. Constraints such as low farm \nproductivity, poor rural infrastructure, lack of access to rural finance, and poor education and skills \nlimit economic opportunities for the rural poor, who are vulnerable to economic and social risks.  \n \n4. \nQinghai  Province,  located  in  the  upper  Yangtze  and  Yellow  River  valleys  in  the \nnortheastern part of the Qinghai\u2013Xizang Plateau, is one of the poorest in the PRC  because of \nits  remote  location,  mountainous  landscape,  and  extreme  climate. 5 It  has  a  relatively  small \npopulation  of  about  5.6  million,  distributed  over  720,000  square  kilometers,  with  59%  of  the \npeople living in rural areas. The poverty incidence is high in Qinghai. In 2009, about 1.38 million \npeople, or 24.7% of the total population, have incomes below the official national poverty line. \nThe  poverty  incidence  is  about  39%  in the  project counties  of  Hualong, Jianzha,  and Xunhua. \nThe people of Qinghai also experience high levels of no-income poverty, including poor access \nto education, safe drinking water, and health services.  \n \nIrrigation  and  agriculture.  Irrigation  water  is  essential  to  sustaining  agriculture \n5. \nthroughout  the  year  in  most  regions  of  the  PRC,  including  Qinghai.  Agriculture  remains  an \nimportant  sector  in  Qinghai,  and  meeting  water  needs  by  improving  water  management  has \nbecome the major  agricultural  development  priority  in the  province.  The  project  area  is  mainly \nserved  by  small  lift  irrigation  pumps that  were  built  in the  early  1970s. They  were  designed  to \npump  water  directly from  the  Yellow  River  using  two or  more  lifts  of  up  to  50 meters  in  height \neach. The pumping stations and on-farm irrigation systems have fallen into disrepair because of \na lack of funding, poor management, and a lack of farmers\u2019 active involvement. Irrigation water \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Qinghai Rural Water Resources Management Project. Manila.  \n3  World  Bank.  2009.  From  Poor  Areas  to  Poor  People:  China\u2019s  Evolving  Poverty  Reduction  Agenda. Washington, \n\n4  The PRC\u2019s official poverty line in 2009 was CNY1,196 per capita per year. \n5  Xizang is also known as Tibet Autonomous Region. \n\nDC. \n\n \n\n\fuse efficiency in the project area is estimated at 35%, which is lower than the national average \nof  45%.6 Rising  pumping  and  agricultural  input  costs  are  forcing  farmers  to  find  alternative \nsources of income. Water is clearly a limiting resource  in the project area because distribution \ncosts are high and local governments of the project counties have limited delivery capacity. As a \nresult, about 21% of farmland has been abandoned in the project counties. \n \n6. \nSince the late 1990s, the government has promoted participatory irrigation management \n(PIM) and initiated steps to transfer secondary and tertiary irrigation canal management to water \nusers  associations  (WUAs).  The  legal  framework  for  the  development  of  the  WUAs  was \nestablished in mid 2000s. By end 2009, about 40,000 WUAs had been established in the PRC. \nThese  WUAs  manage  about  22.7%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  irrigated  area.  Qinghai  Province, \nhowever,  lags  far  behind  in  PIM.  The  province  has  just  a  few  pilot  WUAs,  and  these  were \nestablished on a township basis rather than by hydrological units of the irrigation system which \nhas  been  proven  a more  efficient  system  worldwide.  The Qinghai  Provincial Water  Resources \nDepartment,  local  government  agencies,  and  the  WUAs  have  not  been  able  to  achieve \naccountable  service  delivery  or  recover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  They  are \ntrapped with a vicious cycle of poor irrigation performance and low collection of service charges, \nwhich in turn makes irrigation performance unsustainable.  \n \n7. \nIn  Qinghai,  agricultural  productivity  is  low  because  of  the  unreliability  of  water  delivery \nservice and poor agronomic practices.7 The average wheat yield during 2005\u20132007 in Qinghai \nwas about 3,600 kilograms per hectare (ha), which was only 76% of the national average. From \n1998 to 2009, the annual average increase in wheat yield, one of the main crops in Qinghai and \nthe project area, was just 0.6%; by comparison, the national average increase during the same \nperiod was 2.5%. \n \n8. \nLand  degradation. The PRC faces serious land degradation problems, with more than \n40% of its land increasingly affected by wind erosion, salinization, and desertification.8 Much of \nthe land degradation is a result of poor land use decisions over a long period. Many parts of the \nwestern region, including Qinghai, have low agricultural productivity compared with eastern and \nsouthern  provinces.  Fragile  soils,  widespread  erosion,  water  scarcity,  and  increasingly  erratic \nrainfall patterns are among the factors that have reduced the productive capacity of agricultural \nand pastoral lands, and led to a loss of watershed protection functions. \n \n9. \nAgricultural support system. Agricultural extension services have played an important \nrole in  supporting  agricultural  productivity  and  reducing  poverty  in the  PRC.  Public  agricultural \nextension  agencies  at  all  administrative  levels  play  a  key  role  in  helping  farmers  access  new \nagricultural technologies and market information. However, they often have limited outreach and \ndo not deliver technical advice that is responsive to farmers\u2019 needs. Currently, the services are \nprovided mainly through local agriculture bureaus, although private extension providers such as \nuniversities and private agro-enterprises have recently emerged.  \n \n10. \nClimate  change.  Agricultural  production  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change. \nClimate-change-related  impacts  can  include  a  decline  in  crop  yield,  moisture  loss,  changes  in \n\n                                                \n6   Irrigation  water  use  efficiency  refers  to  the  percentage  of  crop  water  use  against  total  water  supply  into  the \n\nirrigation system. \n\nproduction. \n\n7  Agronomic practices refers to the application of the various soil and plant sciences to soil management and crop \n\n8  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthe  length  of  seasons,  and  extreme  droughts  and  floods.  To  address  climate  change,  the \ngovernment  developed  the  National  Climate  Change  Programme  in  2007. 9  The  program \nidentified agriculture and water management as among the key areas that require better policies \nand  strategies  pertaining  to  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.  However,  in  Qinghai \nProvince,  knowledge  of  climate  change\u2019s  impact  on  agriculture  and  understanding  of  possible \nmitigation  measures  remain  weak,  and  few  concrete  actions  have  been  taken.  The  project \ndesign explores opportunities to enhance the resilience of agriculture and water development to \nclimate change in the province. \n \n11. \nDevelopment  coordination.  A  diverse  array  of  assistance  programs  from  multilateral \nand  bilateral  development  partners  target  agriculture  and  water  resources  in  the  PRC. \nInternational  development  organizations  working  in  the  PRC  are  committed  to  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010.10 The World  Bank  is  a  major  supporter  of \nirrigated agriculture development and has approved more than 10 relevant investment projects \nin the PRC, including projects that promote PIM, WUAs, and the provision of rural training and \nadvisory  services  for  farmers.  ADB  has  assisted  the  PRC  in  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement,  flood  and  wetland  management,  environmental  and  ecosystem  protection,  and \nsustainable agriculture development. However, external assistance by development partners to \nQinghai Province has been limited, with only a few projects implemented. \n \nLessons  from  ADB  projects  and  other  development  partners\u2019  irrigation  and  drainage \n12. \nprojects  include  the  following:  (i)  a  conducive  policy  and  institutional  framework  with  political \nsupport  is  essential  to  improving  and  sustaining  irrigation  and  PIM;  (ii)  sustainable  O&M  with \nuser  financing  should  be  pursued;  (iii) development  and  participation  of  farmers\u2019  organizations \nand  farmers  are  vital  elements  of  irrigation  management  reform;  WUAs  should  be  developed \nearly  in  the  project  cycle,  with  clear  targets  and  continuous  support;  (iv)  efficient  on-farm \nirrigation  systems  and  agronomic  measures  should  be  pursued  as  an  integral  part  of  project \ninterventions; (v) an effective interagency coordination mechanism should be in place; and (vi) \ncapacity development for all institutions and stakeholders is essential. These lessons have been \nincorporated  in the  project  design  by  including  PIM  and farmers\u2019  empowerment  as key  project \ninterventions,  and  establishing  and  charging  a  sufficient  irrigation  service  fee  (ISF)  to  cover \nO&M as a loan assurance. \n \n13. \nGovernment  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  Eleventh  Five-\nYear  Plan,  2006\u20132010  shifted  the  government\u2019s  emphasis  from  economic  growth  toward \nbroader and more inclusive rural and sustainable development in the context of an increasingly \nmarket-oriented economy. To reflect the PRC\u2019s pro-poor economic growth strategy, ADB\u2019s PRC \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010  included  assistance  for  the  rural  poor  to  boost \nproductivity and diversify production through investments in rural infrastructure such as irrigation \nsystems.11  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe impact of the project will be increased farmers\u2019 income and reduced poverty in the \ncounties of Hualong, Jianzha, and Xunhua in Qinghai Province. The outcome will be increased \nagricultural productivity and irrigation water use efficiency in the project area.  \n \n                                                \n9  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC).  2007. \n\nChina\u2019s National Climate Change Programme.

The  government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nThe  government  will  make  available  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  Qinghai  provincial  government \n(QPG), and the QPG will in turn make available the  loan proceeds to the county governments \nthrough  the  prefecture  governments  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB \nloan. The QPG and project county governments will assume the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks of the ADB loan.  \n \n23. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  26.8%  of  the  total  project \ncosts, including part of the cost of main canal development and equipment as well as the cost of \nPIM,  strengthened  agricultural  service  support,  and  improved  project  management.  The  QPG \nwill  finance  $158.1 million,  or  70.7%  of  the  total  project  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties;  land \nacquisition and resettlement; environmental management and monitoring; surveys; and design \nand  supervision.  The  project  counties  will  finance  $5.5  million  financing  charges  on  their \nportions of the ADB loan during implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSource \nAsian Development Bank \nQinghai provincial governmenta \nCounty governmentsb \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n60.0 \n158.1 \n5.5 \n223.6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of Total  \n(%) \n26.8 \n70.7 \n2.5 \n100.0 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Including $64.8 million from the Qinghai Provincial Land and Resources Department. \nb  Project counties will finance the financing charges on their portions of the ADB loan during implementation. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n24. \nthe project administration manual (footnote 12).  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n5 years from October 2011 to September 2016 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2016 \nPeriod of utilization \nUntil 31 March 2017 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv) Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nThe Qinghai provincial project leading group \n\nChair: Vice governor of QPG \n\nMembers: Representatives of the provincial development and reform \ncommission; the provincial departments of agriculture and livestock, \nenvironmental protection, finance, land and resources, and water resources  \nQPG \n(a) The provincial PMO will assume day-to-day responsibility for \n\ncoordination, monitoring, and consolidated reporting for project \nimplementation.

Least-cost  analysis  was  conducted, \nand  the  project  represents  the  least-cost  option  compared  with  alternative  options  of \nrehabilitating  the  existing  lift  irrigation  schemes.  Crop  and  farm  budget  data  were  collected \nthrough  a  survey  of  selected  households  in  each  township  in  the  project  area.  The  analysis \nindicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall economic internal rate of return \nof about 13.9% and an economic net present value of  about CNY208.2 million. The economic \ninternal rates of return of individual subprojects range from 13.1% for Lijiaxia North to 14.3% for \nGongboxia North. Sensitivity analysis shows that the analysis is generally robust. \n  \n26. \nThe financial sustainability of the project has been analyzed, including assessment of (i) \nincentives for government agencies and irrigation users to participate in the project; (ii) the fiscal \nimpact  of  counterpart  funds  to  finance  project  expenditures  and  loan  repayment;  (iii)  the \nrecovery of O&M costs; and (iv) the potential of institutional arrangements to sustain operation \nof irrigation facilities. The amount of counterpart funding for project implementation will be small \ncompared with the total provincial and project county fiscal revenues, and subsidies provided by \nthe  provincial  and  county  governments  for  O&M  will  decline  significantly  if  ISF  collection  is \nimproved. The QPG has committed to provide adequate budgetary support for the project. Local \ngovernment  agencies  and  farmers  have  demonstrated  a  strong  interest  in  participating  in  the \nproject. Farmers will benefit from reliable water supply at much lower cost, and from increased \nincomes as a result of enhanced farm productivity. The ISF to be set under the project will be \nadequate to ensure sustained O&M of irrigation infrastructure and facilities. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the  provincial  PMO,  the  Qinghai \nProvincial  Finance  Department,  and  county  finance  bureaus  are  capable  of  carrying  out \nsatisfactory  accounting  and  financial  reporting  for  the  project.  The  offices  of  the  finance \ninspector,  key  project  inspector,  and  discipline  supervisor  within  these  organizations  perform \npart  of  the  internal  auditor\u2019s  function.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicates  that  (i) \nestablished arrangements are in place in the PRC and Qinghai Province to handle the various \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fstages of procurement, including preparation of bid documents, tender invitation, bid evaluation, \ncontract  award,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  performance  monitoring;  (ii)  the \nprovincial  and  county  PMOs  have  experience  in  undertaking  domestically  financed  water \nresource  and  irrigation  projects  involving  large  volumes  of  procurement  activities;  and  (iii) \nmonitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally in place. In view of limited \nexperience of the PMOs in implementing foreign-funded projects, training on ADB\u2019s procedures \non \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  disbursement  will  be  provided  during \nimplementation.  \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  QPG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nPoverty  impact.  All three project counties are nationally designated poor counties. It is \nestimated that about 130,000 farmers, mainly from ethnic minorities, will benefit directly from the \nproject.  About  50%  of  the  beneficiaries  are  women,  and  39%  are  poor.  The  project  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  lowering  irrigation  costs,  improving  agricultural  productivity, \nand promoting high-value crops through improved water management and technical support. In \naddition, about 13,000 jobs will be created for local residents during project implementation. \n \n30. \nGender and development. A gender analysis was carried out during project preparation \nand the project supports effective gender mainstreaming. Many literate young men and women \nmigrate  out  of  the  project  area  for  employment,  which  explains  the  high  illiteracy\u2014particularly \namong women\u2014among the generally older population that remains. Women, especially in their \n50s and above, tend to stay behind and migrate less, taking more responsibilities in agricultural \nproduction  and  household  chores.  Project  benefits  will  be  spread at  least  equally  among  men \nand  women.  Gender  actions  targeting  increased  benefits  and  participation  for  women  have \nbeen  integrated  into  the  ethnic  minority  development  plans  and  consolidated  in  a  separate \ngender action plan. The project aims particularly to (i) increase the technical capacity of women \nin  agriculture  marketing,  and  (ii)  empower  women  and  ensure  that  they  participate  in  decision \nmaking through membership in WUAs. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  During  project \n31. \npreparation,  a  domestic  environmental  impact  assessment  report  and  a  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  report  (including  an  environmental  management  plan)  were \nprepared  following  the  PRC  regulatory  framework,  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  A  due \ndiligence  assessment  of  safety  and  environmental  management  for  the  two  existing  dams  of \nGongboxia  and  Lijiaxia  shows  that  the  operators  comply  with  national  regulations  and  apply \nadequate environmental management procedures acceptable to ADB. \n  \nThe project is expected to achieve significant environmental benefits in the project area, \n32. \nincluding (i) reduced energy use; (ii) improved water resources management; and (iii) increased \nvegetation  coverage.  The  main  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  risks  include  (i) \nimpacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  canals,  notably  safety  risks  during  tunnel \nconstruction  and  disposal  of  large  volumes  of  spoils;  and  (ii)  potentially,  increased  usage  of \nagrochemicals during operation. It is expected that all impacts will be prevented or minimized to \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fan  acceptable  level  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  and \nmonitoring program.  \n \n33. \nEthnic minorities. The project is classified as category A. The project will benefit almost \nexclusively poor and near-poor ethnic minority households, improving their economic status and \nlivelihoods  without  negatively  impacting  their  social  security  status.  The  three  main  ethnic \ngroups in the project counties\u2014Hui, Salar, and Tibetan\u2014have inhabited this area for more than \n700  years.  They  account  for  96%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  project.  There  have  been  no \nrecorded social  conflicts  in  the  project  area  based  on  ethnicity.  There  seem  to  be  few,  if  any, \ndistinct  customs  related  to  agriculture;  but  traditional  decision-making  structures  will  be \nintegrated into the project activities in the villages. Four ethnic minority development plans have \nbeen  prepared  to  mainstream  pro-minority  activities  and  measures  into  the  project  and \nsafeguard the interests of ethnic minorities.  \n \n34. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A.  It  will \ninvolve  110.8  ha  of  permanent  land  acquisition,  of  which  28  ha  (25%)  is  cultivated  land,  with \nimpacts spread over 68 villages. The impacts on villages are small because about 75% of the \nland  acquired  is  wasteland.  The  28  ha  of  farmland  acquired  affects  6,776  persons,  and  the \naverage degree of loss is about 6%. In addition, 16 households with 101 persons will need to be \nrelocated. The Qinghai Provincial Water Resources Department has prepared two resettlement \nplans. All affected people will be project beneficiaries, as they will receive improved irrigation as \nwell  as resettlement  entitlements  to offset their  losses.  As  compensation,  affected households \ncan  choose  between  replacement  of  irrigated  land  or  cash  compensation.  A  due  diligence \nassessment  for  the  associated  Gongboxia  and  Lijiaxia  reservoirs  found  no  outstanding \nresettlement issues.  \n \nE. \n \n35. \nThe project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks and verify assumptions for the \nachievement of the project benefits, outcome, and impacts. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.13 \n\nThe project has some potential environmental, institutional, governance, and policy risks. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak institutional \ncapacity of the \nexecuting and \nimplementing agencies \n WUA sustainability \n\nISF inadequate to cover \nO&M \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nBased on capacity assessments, the project provides adequate capacity \ndevelopment programs and consulting services to improve the capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies in project implementation and \nmanagement.  \nExtensive stakeholder consultations are a special feature of the project \ndesign. The project has a participatory irrigation management component to \nhelp establish WUAs and empower farmers and WUAs to assume \nresponsibility for operating branch canal and on-farm irrigation systems. \nQinghai provincial government has committed to regularly reviewing and \nadjusting the ISF following national guidelines. The willingness-to-pay \nsurvey has shown that farmers are willing to pay a sufficient ISF to cover \nO&M costs. \n\nISF = irrigation service fee, O&M = operation and maintenance, WUA = water users association. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n13  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n36. \nThe  government  and  the  QPG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37. \nThe  government  and  the  QPG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject  relating  to  counterpart  financing,  irrigation  management  reform  and  the  ISF,  project \nperformance monitoring,  resettlement,  ethnic minority  development,  poverty reduction, gender, \nlabor standards, environment, and grievance mechanisms.
