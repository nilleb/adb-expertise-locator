THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Accelerating Infrastructure \nDelivery through Better Engineering Services Project (ESP).1 \n \n2.  The ESP will help meet the infrastructure development objectives of the Strategic Plan, \n2015\u20132019,  of Indonesia\u2019s  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing (MPWH).2 The  ESP  will \nstrengthen  the  MPWH\u2019s  capacity  to  efficiently  design  and  implement  its  increased  public \ninvestment program by (i) improving the quality and timely start-up of infrastructure projects, and \n(ii) strengthening the MPWH\u2019s public investment management systems. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Inadequate  infrastructure  provision. Logistics costs in Indonesia are estimated at \n24% of gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of underserved and congested transport \nnetworks.3 In Jakarta alone, road congestion is estimated to result in Rp65 trillion (0.6% of GDP) \nin losses annually. Only 55% of Indonesia\u2019s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity \nreducing  yields  and  cropping  intensity.4 Poor  flood  control  infrastructure  is  a  major  factor, \ncontributing to economic losses of $430 million annually. Access to basic urban water and \nsanitation services lags far behind other middle-income countries. In 2014, just 80.7% of the \nurban population had access to improved water sources, while 61.1% had access to improved \nsanitation facilities. Only 4% of septage and 1% of urban wastewater are treated. Overall, \ninadequate  infrastructure  has  been  one  of  the  main  impediments  to  doing  business  in \nIndonesia, and it has hampered inclusive growth and poverty reduction in Indonesia.5 \n \n4.  Underinvestment in infrastructure. The gap in infrastructure provision is due to a long \nperiod of underinvestment: overall infrastructure spending in Indonesia dropped from 8% of \nGDP during 1995\u20131997 to about 4% of GDP during 2008\u20132014,6 well below the estimated \ninvestment  need  of  6%\u20137%  of  GDP.7 Particularly  low  was  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure \ninvestment, which averaged 3% of GDP during 2008\u20132014.8 The government\u2019s ability to spend \nwhat had been allocated for infrastructure was also a problem, as it actually utilized only around \n85% of what had been budgeted for infrastructure spending each year. To help overcome \nunderinvestment  in  infrastructure,  the  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN), \n2015\u20132019  envisages  total  infrastructure  investment  to  increase  to  Rp4,800  trillion  from \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Government of Indonesia, MPWH. Strategic Plan of MPWH for Years 2015 to 2019. Jakarta. MPWH Regulation No. \n13.1/PRT/M/2015. \n3 Road-based transportation accounts for more than 70% of overall logistics costs in Indonesia. Logistics costs are \nestimated at 16% of GDP in Thailand, and 13% of GDP in Malaysia. \n4 Government of Indonesia, MPWH. 2014. Irrigation Systems Rapid Assessment. Jakarta. \n5 The World Bank estimates that faster growth of infrastructure stock in 2001\u20132011 may have (i) raised average GDP \ngrowth from 5.3% (actual) to 5.8%\u20137.0% during this period, and (ii) reduced the poverty rate in 2011 from 11.4% \n(actual) to 6.9%\u20139.9%. World Bank. 2013. Indonesia Economic Quarterly: Continuing Adjustment. Jakarta.  \n6 During 2011\u20132013, infrastructure investment averaged 7% of GDP in Thailand, 8% in Viet Nam, and 10% in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.  \n7 B. Bhattacharyay. 2010. Estimating Demand for Infrastructure in Energy, Transport, Telecommunications, Water \nand Sanitation in Asia and the Pacific: 2010\u20132020. ADB Institute Working Paper. No. 248. Tokyo: ADB Institute. \n8 Despite recent progress, private participation in infrastructure remains low at 0.5% of GDP compared with 2.3% of \nGDP during 1995\u20131997. This is mainly due to fragmented legal and institutional frameworks and lack of project \npreparation capacity of government contracting agencies. ", "2 \nRp1,900  trillion  under  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.9 The  government\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  is \nexpected to increase from 3.1% of GDP in 2014 to 6.2% in 2019. \n \n5.  Momentum in acceleration of infrastructure delivery. The reform of fuel subsidies in \nJanuary 2015 has enabled the government\u2019s infrastructure budget to increase from Rp144.4 \ntrillion in 2014 to Rp280.3 trillion in 2015 and to Rp302.6 trillion in 2016. The line ministries are \nresponsible for the delivery of more than 50% of the government\u2019s infrastructure budget.10 The \nincrease in infrastructure spending has been accompanied by institutional reforms to enable the \nministries to deliver their public investment programs in an accelerated manner. In 2014\u20132015, \nthe government (i) established a dedicated office for land acquisition at the National Land \nAgency,11 (ii) strengthened the procurement units of government agencies and rolled out a \nnational e-procurement system, (iii) increased the use of advance procurement and multiyear \ncontracts  for  infrastructure  projects,  and  (iv)  set  up  a  budget  realization  evaluation  and \nmonitoring team to address implementation constraints at the central and subnational levels.12 \n \n6.  Role of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing in infrastructure delivery. The \nMPWH  leads  the  government\u2019s  effort  to  meet  RPJMN,  2015\u20132019  targets  to  build  3,650 \nkilometers of new highways, improve the irrigation network covering 1 million hectares, build 49 \ndams, attain 100% access to drinking water, reduce slum areas to 0%, and achieve 100% \naccess to improved sanitation, all by 2019.13 During 2015\u20132019, the MPWH\u2019s infrastructure \nprogram is estimated at Rp660 trillion or 47% of the government\u2019s infrastructure program. In \n2015\u20132016, Rp207 trillion (about 37% of the government\u2019s infrastructure budget) was allocated \nto the MPWH. Within MPWH, 90% of its budget in 2015\u20132016 has been allocated to three \ndirectorates general: Directorate General of Highways (DGH), Directorate General of Water \nResources (DGWR), and the Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS). \n \n7.  Critical  constraints.  Efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  MPWH\u2019s  infrastructure \nprograms has been constrained by complex land acquisition processes, weak procurement \ncapacity, inadequate preparation of infrastructure projects, and poor infrastructure planning and \ndelivery systems. With the implementation of the new land acquisition law and continuous \nefforts to strengthen procurement capacity, it is now inadequate preparation of infrastructure \nprojects  and  poor  infrastructure  planning  and  delivery  systems  that  critically  constrain  the \nMPWH\u2019s ability to deliver infrastructure in a timely and good quality manner. \n \n8.  Causes of critical constraints. Inadequate project preparation is largely due to (i) lack \nof resources to complete the required assessments, surveys, designs, and environmental and \nland acquisition clearances; and (ii) the low quality of feasibility studies and detailed engineering \ndesigns, many of which often need to be redone during implementation.14 Poor infrastructure \n                                                \n9  Of this amount, Rp1,400 trillion (29%) is expected to come from the national government, Rp550 trillion (11%) from \nthe local governments, Rp1,100 trillion (23%) from state-owned enterprises, and Rp1,750 trillion (37%) from the \nprivate sector. Government of Indonesia. 2015. Indonesia National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019. \nJakarta. \n10 The line ministries include the ministries of public works and housing, transportation, agriculture, and energy and \nmineral resources. \n11 This office was one of the institutional reforms initiated to implement the new land acquisition law (Law No. 2 of \n2012). This law sets clear steps and timelines for land acquisition, including dispute resolution through courts, after \nwhich land can be acquired for public purposes. \n12 Presidential Instruction No. 1/2015; MPWH Instruction No. 3/2015; Minister of Finance Circular No. S-577/2015; \nMinister of Finance Regulation No. 238/2015; and Presidential Decree No. 20/2015. \n13 Improved sanitation refers to flush toilets linked to a piped sewerage system or septic tanks. \n14 In externally financed projects, the cost of preparation of detailed engineering designs, environmental impact \nassessments,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  government  requirements  is \n ", "3 \nplanning and delivery is mainly due to fragmented and short-term infrastructure development \nprograms, inappropriate or outdated design standards, project fragmentation as reflected in \nprevalence  of  small  and  short  contracts,  poor  construction  quality,  and  ineffective \nmaintenance.15 Improving  project  preparation  and  infrastructure  planning  and  delivery  will \ntherefore be critical to enable the MPWH to meet its ambitious infrastructure development \ntargets and increase value for money given the significant increase in its infrastructure budget. \n \n9.  Consulting industry context. The capacity of domestic consulting firms working in \npublic  works  areas  is  generally  weak.  Therefore,  the  significant  increase  in  government \ninfrastructure investments, the growing complexity of projects, and the government\u2019s intention to \nmainstream international best practices and technology in project design and implementation \nwill pose a challenge to domestic consulting firms involved in public works areas. It is therefore \nimportant to the success of the MPWH\u2019s infrastructure program to attract more international and \ndomestic consulting firms to work on infrastructure project preparation. To date, international \nconsulting  firms  have  been  reluctant  to  engage  with  government  agencies  for  project \npreparation mainly due to the following factors: restrictions on foreign firm participation in public \nbidding,  small  contract  budgets,  payment  in  local  currency,  and  reputational  risk.  Strong \ndomestic consulting firms also shy away from government assignments due to similar issues, as \nwell as high transaction costs of dealing with the public sector compared with private sector \ncontracts. \n \n10.  Asian Development Bank support. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a long \nhistory  of  supporting  the  MPWH\u2019s  infrastructure  development  through  investment  and  TA \nprojects in the water resources, roads, and water supply and sanitation sectors. ADB has also \nsupported  the  preparation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  by  setting  up  a  project \ndevelopment  facility  at  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).16 Most \nrecently, ADB has been supporting BAPPENAS to reduce project start-up delays.17 \n \n11.  Lessons. Major lessons learned in supporting project preparation in Indonesia are as \nfollows: (i) it is more efficient to provide project preparation support directly to implementing \nagencies, (ii) support should cover preparation of due diligence and compliance documents that \nare in line with government requirements to ensure timely start-up of civil works, and (iii) the \nproject preparation mechanism needs to be designed to be part of the overall strengthening of \nthe implementing agency\u2019s public investment management systems. \n \n12.  Distinct features. The ESP targets the MPWH\u2019s critical constraints, and incorporates \nthe consulting industry context (para. 9) and lessons learned (para. 11). The ESP is the first \n                                                                                                                                                       \nbudgeted as part of the projects. This may result in a maximum 1.5-year delay in project start-up after loan \neffectiveness. In ADB-financed projects, this is a key factor behind the loan extensions that average 2.4 years. \n15 D. Ray and L.Y. Ing. 2016. Survey of Recent Developments: Addressing Indonesia's Infrastructure Deficit. Bulletin \nof Indonesian Economic Studies. 52 (1). pp. 1\u201325. In 2015, 93% of the construction contracts signed by the MPWH \nwere single-year contracts, under which construction is often rushed, resulting in substandard quality and weak \nsupervision. The use of multiyear contracts will help address this by better capturing economies of scale, allowing \nadequate time for effective implementation, and reducing the transaction cost to the government. \n16 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Aligning Asian Development Bank and Country \nSystems for Improved Project Performance. Manila. This technical assistance supports (i) development of action \nplans  to  apply  country  safeguard  systems  for  environment  and  resettlement  in  ADB-financed  projects,  (ii) \nharmonization of ADB\u2019s and government\u2019s bidding documents for procurement of goods, works, and consultants, \nand (iii) review of planning, budgeting, and staffing processes of line ministries and local governments to improve \nthe government\u2019s project readiness criteria and ensure these processes are adequately considered in ADB\u2019s \nbusiness processes related to project preparation. \n ", "4 \nproject that is fully dedicated to the preparation of a pipeline of infrastructure projects according \nto government requirements. The ESP will help the MPWH achieve better quality and timeliness \nof project preparation and construction supervision, and adequately mainstream international \nbest practices and technology in project design and construction supervision. In parallel, the \nESP will strengthen the MPWH\u2019s public investment management systems, including in master \nplanning, project preparation and designs, procurement, environmental and social safeguards, \nand construction supervision. This two-pronged approach will help sustain the ESP\u2019s support to \nthe MPWH beyond the project implementation period. \n \n13.  New consultant selection approach. Under the ESP, a large number of consulting firm \ncontracts  will  need  to be  expeditiously  procured. Given  this,  and  based  on  ADB\u2019s  unique \nexperience in supporting the preparation of large pipelines of PPP projects in India and the \nPhilippines,18 the ESP will apply the following two-phase method for selecting consulting firms \nfor project preparation purposes: (i) the consulting firms will be selected to be part of a panel, \nand the empanelled firms will be retained for up to 3 years on a noncommittal basis under \nindefinite delivery contracts (empanelment phase); and (ii) for preparation of individual projects, \na selection will be made from the panel based on the evaluation of full technical proposals \nsubmitted by the consultants (call-down phase).19 MPWH will apply this two-phase approach for \nthe first time under the ESP. The National Public Procurement Agency has encouraged piloting \ntesting this approach at MPWH for eventual replication in other sectors. \n \n14.  Efficiency gains. Application of the two-phase method and other special arrangements \n(para. 26) will result in significant reduction of time for selecting consulting firms. For example, it \nis estimated that 87 days will be required to recruit a project preparation consulting firm under \nthe ESP, against ADB\u2019s standard of 120 days for consultant recruitment under loan projects.20 \nThe use of this method (along with the application of large multiyear contracts with direct \npayment procedure) will also help overcome the reluctance of international and domestic firms \nin participating in public works consulting assignments (para. 9). \n \n15.  Comprehensive support to the acceleration of infrastructure delivery. The ESP is \nan  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  comprehensive  support  under  the  proposed  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132019 to the government\u2019s agenda on accelerating infrastructure delivery.21 It \ncomplements  public  procurement  reform  under  the  Stepping  Up  Investment  for  Growth \nAcceleration Program.22 The ESP will support the preparation of selected projects under the \nIntegrated Participatory Development and Management of Irrigation Program planned for 2016, \nand the Food Security and Bulk Water Supply Program and the Citywide Sanitation Investment \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n19 When deliverables, timelines, and a payment schedule of the call-down assignment can be clearly defined, the \nconsultants will be engaged under lump-sum contracts. Use of lump-sum contracts will allow a more flexible use of \nstrong national experts, who can be members of several firms\u2019 teams at the same time. At the same time, lump-\nsum contracts will ensure that the firm is fully accountable for its deliverables. Lump-sum contracts will be \nconsidered for project preparation only. Consultants for construction supervision and technical and financial \nassessment during construction will be engaged through time-based contracts. \n20 The time savings are even larger if compared against the current practice of 348 days under loans.

Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. The ESP is closely aligned with the inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth agendas of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 via    \n(i) improving project designs to promote creation and enhancement of access to economic \nopportunities; (ii) ensuring that reduction of vulnerability and improvement of resilience are \nadequately  covered  during  preparation  of  infrastructure  projects;  (iii)  improving  public \ninfrastructure  management  systems;  and  (iv)  strengthening  capacity  development  of \nimplementing agencies in construction, operation, and maintenance of infrastructure assets.25 \nThe ESP has also followed the action plan for the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 by (i) \nhaving ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department join the project team \nand provide support during loan processing, (ii) streamlining the process for the recruitment of \nconsulting firms, (iii) using lump-sum contracts as default contract types, (iv) reducing the time \ntaken by ADB to review consultant contracts, and (v) using a 90:10 (technical quality\u2013price) ratio \nfor the evaluation of proposals on infrastructure project preparation (footnote 20).26 \n \n17.  Development  partner  coordination.  Major  development  partners  working  with  the \nMPWH have supported the rationale, design, and consultant selection approach of the ESP. \nSpecifically, in the road sector, the ESP will implement the policies, tools, design standards, and \nquality  assurance  arrangements  developed  under  the  Government  of  Australia-funded \nIndonesia Infrastructure Initiative and East Indonesia National Roads Improvement Project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The impact will be the attainment of infrastructure objectives of the MPWH\u2019s Strategic \nPlan, 2015\u20132019 (footnote 2). The outcome will be strengthened capacity of MPWH\u2019s DGH, \nDGHS, and DGWR to efficiently design and implement MPWH\u2019s public investment program. \n \nC.  Outputs \n19.

In the irrigation sector, the new technologies are related to the web-based \nintegrated asset management information system with geospatial interface, high-resolution aerial surveys for \nsurvey of irrigation assets, and satellite-based water accounting. The detailed engineering design guidelines of the \nirrigation sector will be also updated to incorporate climate change and water efficiency, among other issues.

Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The MPWH, through its secretariat general, will be the executing agency, with DGH, \nDGWR, and DGHS as implementing agencies.31 MPWH will establish a steering committee to \nmonitor the ESP\u2019s overall implementation and ensure ESP-supported projects are prioritized for \nimplementation.  A  project  coordination  office  will  be  established  at  the  Bureau  of  Budget \nPlanning  and  International  Cooperation  of  the  MPWH\u2019s  secretariat  general  to  support  the \nsteering committee.32 DGH, DGHS, and DGWR will each establish (i) a project management \noffice  headed  by  a  project  director  and  supported  by  administrative  staff;  and  (ii)  project \nimplementation  units  within  their  respective  sector  directorates  to  lead  the  selection  of \nconsultants for project preparation, with participation of concerned local offices of DGH, DGHS, \nand DGWR, as required. The project implementation units and local offices of DGH, DGHS, and \nDGWR will establish project teams to review and endorse the outputs of consulting firms for \ndirect payment by ADB. All consultants will be recruited and managed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.33 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation  December 2016\u2013December 2019 \nperiod \nEstimated  31 December 2019 (estimated loan closing date: 30 June 2020) \ncompletion date \nProject management \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee \nSecretary general of the MPWH (chair) \nDirectors general of MPWH\u2019s DGH, DGHS, and DGWR (members) \n                                                \n31 Programming and budgeting of loan-funded infrastructure projects of the MPWH are carried out at directorate \ngeneral level. In line with this, the government programmed separate engineering services projects for DGWR, \nDGHS, and DGH. Due to efficiency considerations, it was decided to integrate these separate projects in one \noperation. Given this, under the ESP, MPWH through its secretariat general, has been designated as the executing \nagency, with DGH, DGHS, and DGWR as implementing agencies. \n32 To support the project coordination office and facilitate advance action on consultant selection (Table 3), ADB \nengaged three individual consultants under the TA cluster (footnote 24).

To ensure expeditious implementation, the government and ADB have agreed on (i) the \nuse of the government\u2019s e-procurement platform for the selection of consultants under the ESP, \n(ii) benchmark timelines for each step during the consultant selection process, and (iii) post-\nreview arrangement for the selection of consulting firms at the call-down phase (para. 13).34 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  The ESP will help improve the technical quality of infrastructure projects through (i) the \nuse of new technology and improved design standards that help prolong the life of infrastructure \n(footnote 27), (ii) new technical solutions by contractors through the increased use of design-\nand-build contracts, (iii) on-the-job knowledge transfer between project preparation consultants \n                                                \n34 The government e-procurement system has been adjusted to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).

Economic and Financial \n28.  The  ESP  will  generate  significant  economic  benefits.  It  will  directly  facilitate  the \npreparation of $6 billion in infrastructure investments, which will potentially add up to $4 billion to \nGDP during 2019\u20132023.35 Through strengthening the public investment management systems \nof MPWH\u2014the ministry with the largest infrastructure budget\u2014the ESP will contribute to the \nacceleration of infrastructure delivery, which can help increase the country\u2019s potential economic \ngrowth.36 The ESP\u2019s contribution to road infrastructure improvement can significantly contribute \nto  economic  growth  due  to  the  increased  competitiveness  of  domestic  products  and  the \nincreased production of goods that were previously not tradable due to expensive interisland \ntransport and logistics costs, and by stimulating new private investment.37 \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  The ESP\u2019s overall procurement risk classification is assessed medium.38 A financial \nmanagement  assessment  concluded  that  the  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.39 In \nfiduciary issues, DGH, DGHS, and DGWR will be comprehensively supported by the project \nmanagement consulting firms engaged for the duration of the ESP. To support efficient and \neffective oversight and institutional coordination, the secretariat general of the MPWH will be \nsupported through ADB TA (footnote 32). To enable adequate disclosure of information, the \nMPWH has committed to set up a dedicated web page for the ESP. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 33). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  While the ESP is not expected to have direct poverty, gender, or social impacts, the \ninfrastructure projects prepared under the ESP will generate such impacts. Assessment of such \nimpacts will be done by the project preparation consulting firms selected at the call-down phase. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  The ESP will focus on preparing infrastructure projects and strengthening the capacity of \nthe MPWH.40 Hence, it is not expected to have any direct adverse social and environmental \nimpacts.
