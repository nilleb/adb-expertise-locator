Logistics  costs  in  Indonesia  are  estimated  at \n3. \n24%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  as  a  result  of  underserved  and  congested  transport \nnetworks.3 In Jakarta alone, road congestion is estimated to result in Rp65 trillion (0.6% of GDP) \nin  losses  annually.  Only  55%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  irrigation  system  is  functioning  at  full  capacity \nreducing  yields  and  cropping  intensity. 4  Poor  flood  control  infrastructure  is  a  major  factor, \ncontributing  to  economic  losses  of  $430  million  annually.  Access  to  basic  urban  water  and \nsanitation  services  lags  far  behind  other  middle-income  countries.  In  2014,  just  80.7%  of  the \nurban population had access to improved water sources, while 61.1% had access to improved \nsanitation  facilities.  Only  4%  of  septage  and  1%  of  urban  wastewater  are  treated.  Overall, \ninadequate  infrastructure  has  been  one  of  the  main  impediments  to  doing  business  in \nIndonesia, and it has hampered inclusive growth and poverty reduction in Indonesia.5 \n \nUnderinvestment in infrastructure. The gap in infrastructure provision is due to a long \n4. \nperiod  of  underinvestment:  overall  infrastructure  spending  in  Indonesia  dropped  from  8%  of \nGDP  during  1995\u20131997  to  about  4%  of  GDP  during  2008\u20132014,6 well  below  the  estimated \ninvestment  need  of  6%\u20137%  of  GDP. 7  Particularly  low  was  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure \ninvestment, which averaged 3% of GDP during 2008\u20132014.8 The government\u2019s ability to spend \nwhat had been allocated for infrastructure was also a problem, as it actually utilized only around \n85%  of  what  had  been  budgeted  for  infrastructure  spending  each  year.  To  help  overcome \nunderinvestment  in  infrastructure,  the  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN), \n2015\u20132019  envisages  total  infrastructure  investment  to  increase  to  Rp4,800  trillion  from \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Government of Indonesia, MPWH.

Logistics costs  are \n\nestimated at 16% of GDP in Thailand, and 13% of GDP in Malaysia. \n\n4 Government of Indonesia, MPWH. 2014. Irrigation Systems Rapid Assessment. Jakarta. \n5 The World Bank estimates that faster growth of infrastructure stock in 2001\u20132011 may have (i) raised average GDP \ngrowth from 5.3%  (actual) to 5.8%\u20137.0% during this period, and (ii) reduced  the poverty rate in 2011 from 11.4% \n(actual) to 6.9%\u20139.9%. World Bank. 2013. Indonesia Economic Quarterly: Continuing Adjustment. Jakarta.  \n\n6 During  2011\u20132013,  infrastructure  investment  averaged  7%  of  GDP  in  Thailand,  8%  in  Viet  Nam,  and  10%  in  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.  \n\n7 B.  Bhattacharyay.  2010.  Estimating  Demand  for  Infrastructure  in  Energy,  Transport,  Telecommunications,  Water \nand Sanitation in Asia and the Pacific: 2010\u20132020. ADB Institute Working Paper. No. 248. Tokyo: ADB Institute. \n8 Despite recent progress, private participation in infrastructure remains low at 0.5% of GDP compared with 2.3% of \nGDP  during  1995\u20131997.  This  is  mainly  due  to  fragmented  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  and  lack  of  project \npreparation capacity of government contracting agencies. \n\n\fRp1,900  trillion  under  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014. 9  The  government\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  is \nexpected to increase from 3.1% of GDP in 2014 to 6.2% in 2019. \n \n5. \nMomentum in acceleration of infrastructure delivery. The reform of fuel subsidies in \nJanuary  2015  has  enabled  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  budget  to  increase  from  Rp144.4 \ntrillion in 2014 to Rp280.3 trillion in 2015 and to Rp302.6 trillion in 2016. The line ministries are \nresponsible for the delivery of more than 50% of the government\u2019s infrastructure budget.10 The \nincrease in infrastructure spending has been accompanied by institutional reforms to enable the \nministries to deliver their public investment programs in an accelerated manner. In 2014\u20132015, \nthe  government  (i)  established  a  dedicated  office  for  land  acquisition  at  the  National  Land \nAgency,11 (ii)  strengthened  the  procurement  units  of  government  agencies  and  rolled  out  a \nnational  e-procurement  system,  (iii)  increased  the  use  of  advance  procurement  and  multiyear \ncontracts  for  infrastructure  projects,  and  (iv)  set  up  a  budget  realization  evaluation  and \nmonitoring team to address implementation constraints at the central and subnational levels.12 \n \n6. \nRole  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing  in  infrastructure  delivery.  The \nMPWH  leads  the  government\u2019s  effort  to  meet  RPJMN,  2015\u20132019  targets  to  build  3,650 \nkilometers of new highways, improve the irrigation network covering 1 million hectares, build 49 \ndams,  attain  100%  access  to  drinking  water,  reduce  slum  areas  to  0%,  and  achieve  100% \naccess  to  improved  sanitation,  all  by  2019.13 During  2015\u20132019,  the  MPWH\u2019s  infrastructure \nprogram  is  estimated  at  Rp660  trillion  or  47%  of  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  program.  In \n2015\u20132016, Rp207 trillion (about 37% of the government\u2019s infrastructure budget) was allocated \nto  the  MPWH.  Within  MPWH,  90%  of  its  budget  in  2015\u20132016  has  been  allocated  to  three \ndirectorates  general:  Directorate  General  of  Highways  (DGH),  Directorate  General  of  Water \nResources (DGWR), and the Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS). \n \n7. \nCritical  constraints.  Efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  MPWH\u2019s  infrastructure \nprograms  has  been  constrained  by  complex  land  acquisition  processes,  weak  procurement \ncapacity, inadequate preparation of infrastructure projects, and poor infrastructure planning and \ndelivery  systems.  With  the  implementation  of  the  new  land  acquisition  law  and  continuous \nefforts  to  strengthen  procurement  capacity,  it  is  now  inadequate  preparation  of  infrastructure \nprojects  and  poor  infrastructure  planning  and  delivery  systems  that  critically  constrain  the \nMPWH\u2019s ability to deliver infrastructure in a timely and good quality manner. \n \n8. \nCauses of critical constraints. Inadequate project preparation is largely due to (i) lack \nof  resources to complete the  required  assessments,  surveys,  designs, and environmental  and \nland acquisition clearances; and (ii) the low quality of feasibility studies and detailed engineering \ndesigns,  many  of  which  often  need  to  be  redone  during  implementation.14 Poor  infrastructure \n\n                                                \n9  Of this amount, Rp1,400 trillion (29%) is expected to come from the national government, Rp550 trillion (11%) from \nthe  local  governments,  Rp1,100  trillion  (23%)  from  state-owned  enterprises,  and  Rp1,750  trillion  (37%)  from  the \nprivate sector. Government of Indonesia. 2015. Indonesia National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019. \nJakarta. \n\n10 The line ministries include the ministries of public works and housing, transportation, agriculture, and energy and \n\nmineral resources. \n\n11 This  office  was  one  of  the institutional  reforms initiated  to implement  the  new  land acquisition  law  (Law  No.  2  of \n2012). This law sets clear steps and timelines for land acquisition, including dispute resolution through courts, after \nwhich land can be acquired for public purposes. \n\n12 Presidential  Instruction  No.  1/2015;  MPWH  Instruction  No.  3/2015;  Minister  of  Finance  Circular  No.  S-577/2015; \n\nMinister of Finance Regulation No. 238/2015; and Presidential Decree No. 20/2015. \n\n13 Improved sanitation refers to flush toilets linked to a piped sewerage system or septic tanks. \n14 In  externally  financed  projects,  the  cost  of  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  designs,  environmental  impact \nassessments,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  government  requirements  is \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fplanning  and  delivery  is  mainly  due  to  fragmented  and  short-term  infrastructure  development \nprograms, inappropriate  or  outdated  design standards, project fragmentation  as reflected  in \nprevalence  of  small  and  short  contracts,  poor  construction  quality,  and \nineffective \nmaintenance. 15  Improving  project  preparation  and  infrastructure  planning  and  delivery  will \ntherefore  be  critical  to  enable  the  MPWH  to  meet  its  ambitious  infrastructure  development \ntargets and increase value for money given the significant increase in its infrastructure budget. \n\n \n9. \nConsulting  industry  context.  The  capacity  of  domestic  consulting  firms  working  in \npublic  works  areas  is  generally  weak.  Therefore,  the  significant  increase  in  government \ninfrastructure investments, the growing complexity of projects, and the government\u2019s intention to \nmainstream  international  best  practices  and  technology  in  project  design  and  implementation \nwill pose a challenge to domestic consulting firms involved in public works areas. It is therefore \nimportant to the success of the MPWH\u2019s infrastructure program to attract more international and \ndomestic  consulting  firms  to  work  on  infrastructure  project  preparation.  To  date,  international \nconsulting  firms  have  been  reluctant  to  engage  with  government  agencies  for  project \npreparation mainly due to the following factors: restrictions on foreign firm participation in public \nbidding,  small  contract  budgets,  payment  in  local  currency,  and  reputational  risk.  Strong \ndomestic consulting firms also shy away from government assignments due to similar issues, as \nwell  as  high  transaction  costs  of  dealing  with  the  public  sector  compared  with  private  sector \ncontracts. \n \n10. \nAsian  Development  Bank  support.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  a  long \nhistory  of  supporting  the  MPWH\u2019s  infrastructure  development  through  investment  and  TA \nprojects in the water resources, roads, and water supply and sanitation sectors. ADB has also \nsupported  the  preparation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  by  setting  up  a  project \ndevelopment  facility  at  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS). 16  Most \nrecently, ADB has been supporting BAPPENAS to reduce project start-up delays.17 \n \nLessons.  Major  lessons  learned  in  supporting  project  preparation  in  Indonesia  are  as \n11. \nfollows:  (i)  it  is  more  efficient  to  provide  project  preparation  support  directly  to  implementing \nagencies, (ii) support should cover preparation of due diligence and compliance documents that \nare  in  line  with  government  requirements  to  ensure  timely  start-up  of  civil  works,  and  (iii)  the \nproject preparation mechanism needs to be designed to be part of the overall strengthening of \nthe implementing agency\u2019s public investment management systems. \n \n12. \nDistinct  features.  The  ESP  targets  the  MPWH\u2019s  critical  constraints,  and  incorporates \nthe  consulting  industry  context  (para.  9)  and  lessons  learned  (para.  11).  The  ESP  is  the  first \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nbudgeted  as  part  of  the  projects.  This  may  result  in  a  maximum  1.5-year  delay  in  project  start-up  after  loan \neffectiveness. In ADB-financed projects, this is a key factor behind the loan extensions that average 2.4 years. \n15 D. Ray and L.Y. Ing. 2016. Survey of Recent Developments: Addressing Indonesia's Infrastructure Deficit. Bulletin \nof Indonesian Economic Studies. 52 (1). pp. 1\u201325. In 2015, 93% of the construction contracts signed by the MPWH \nwere  single-year  contracts,  under  which  construction  is  often  rushed,  resulting  in  substandard  quality  and  weak \nsupervision. The use of multiyear contracts will help address this by better capturing economies of scale, allowing \nadequate time for effective implementation, and reducing the transaction cost to the government. \n\n16 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Aligning Asian Development Bank and Country \nSystems  for  Improved  Project  Performance.  Manila.  This  technical  assistance supports  (i)  development  of action \nplans  to  apply  country  safeguard  systems  for  environment  and  resettlement  in  ADB-financed  projects,  (ii) \nharmonization of ADB\u2019s and government\u2019s  bidding documents for procurement of goods, works, and consultants, \nand (iii) review of planning, budgeting, and staffing processes of line ministries and local governments to improve \nthe  government\u2019s  project  readiness  criteria  and  ensure  these  processes  are  adequately  considered  in  ADB\u2019s \nbusiness processes related to project preparation. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fproject that is fully dedicated to the preparation of a pipeline of infrastructure projects according \nto government requirements. The ESP will help the MPWH achieve better quality and timeliness \nof  project  preparation  and  construction  supervision,  and  adequately  mainstream  international \nbest  practices  and  technology  in  project  design  and  construction  supervision.  In  parallel,  the \nESP  will  strengthen  the MPWH\u2019s  public  investment management systems,  including  in master \nplanning,  project  preparation  and designs,  procurement,  environmental and social  safeguards, \nand construction supervision. This two-pronged approach will help sustain the ESP\u2019s support to \nthe MPWH beyond the project implementation period. \n \n13. \nNew consultant selection approach. Under the ESP, a large number of consulting firm \ncontracts  will  need  to  be  expeditiously  procured.  Given  this,  and  based  on  ADB\u2019s  unique \nexperience  in  supporting  the  preparation  of  large  pipelines  of  PPP  projects  in  India  and  the \nPhilippines,18 the  ESP  will  apply  the  following  two-phase  method  for  selecting  consulting  firms \nfor  project  preparation  purposes: (i)  the  consulting firms  will  be  selected  to  be  part  of  a  panel, \nand  the  empanelled  firms  will  be  retained  for  up  to  3  years  on  a  noncommittal  basis  under \nindefinite delivery contracts (empanelment phase); and (ii) for preparation of individual projects, \na  selection  will  be  made  from  the  panel  based  on  the  evaluation  of  full  technical  proposals \nsubmitted by the consultants (call-down phase).19 MPWH will apply this two-phase approach for \nthe first time under the ESP. The National Public Procurement Agency has encouraged piloting \ntesting this approach at MPWH for eventual replication in other sectors. \n\n \n14. \nEfficiency gains. Application of the two-phase method and other special arrangements \n(para. 26) will result in significant reduction of time for selecting consulting firms. For example, it \nis estimated that 87 days will be required to recruit a  project preparation consulting firm under \nthe ESP, against ADB\u2019s standard of 120 days for consultant recruitment under loan projects.20 \nThe  use  of  this  method  (along  with  the  application  of  large  multiyear  contracts  with  direct \npayment procedure) will also help overcome the reluctance of international and domestic firms \nin participating in public works consulting assignments (para. 9). \n \n15. \nComprehensive  support  to  the  acceleration  of  infrastructure  delivery. The ESP is \nan  integral  part  of  ADB\u2019s  comprehensive  support  under  the  proposed  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132019  to  the  government\u2019s  agenda  on  accelerating  infrastructure  delivery. 21 It \ncomplements  public  procurement  reform  under  the  Stepping  Up  Investment  for  Growth \nAcceleration  Program.22 The  ESP  will  support  the  preparation  of  selected  projects  under  the \nIntegrated Participatory Development and Management of Irrigation Program planned for 2016, \nand the Food Security and Bulk Water Supply Program and the Citywide Sanitation Investment \n\n                                                \n18 ADB.  2008.

Use of lump-sum contracts will allow a more flexible use of \nstrong national experts, who can be members of several firms\u2019 teams at the same time. At the same time, lump-\nsum  contracts  will  ensure  that  the  firm  is  fully  accountable  for  its  deliverables.  Lump-sum  contracts  will  be \nconsidered  for  project  preparation  only.
