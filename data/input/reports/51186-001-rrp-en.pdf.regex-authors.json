I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans of \n(i) up to $50,000,000 in United States (US) dollars to Arctic Green Energy Corporation Private \nLimited (AGE); and (ii) up to $200,000,000 equivalent in US dollars and yuan to Sinopec Green \nEnergy Geothermal Development (SGE) for the Geothermal District Heating  Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project supports private sector participation in urban district heating with geothermal \nenergy in the PRC. By facilitating the delivery of clean and reliable heating services, the project \nhelps mitigate air pollution. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n3.  Heating is an important aspect of the PRC\u2019s fight against air pollution and climate change. \nApproximately 25% of energy consumed in the country\u2019s buildings is used to produce space heat; \nin the northern PRC, heating\u2019s share is 50%. Heating needs are met primarily by cogeneration \nunits, household stoves, and heat-only boilers, for which the share of coal as a feedstock is \napproximately  80%.1 This  has  severe  environmental  consequences,  as  particulate  matter \nproduced from coal combustion is a primary cause of urban air pollution and is in turn associated \nwith a range of serious health impacts and a reduction of economic output.2 Coal combustion is \nalso a leading source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), of which the PRC is the world\u2019s leading \nemitter, contributing directly to global climate change. \n \n4.  The  government  has  long  recognized  these  challenges,  and  has  placed  increasing \nattention on improving the environmental performance of the urban heating system. Policies \nissued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection instruct municipalities to close small-scale \nheat-only boilers and promote more energy-efficient technologies, including those based on \nrenewable energy.3 Among the various options for more environmentally sustainable heating, \ngeothermal energy has emerged as a new government priority.4 Geothermal energy offers stable \ntemperatures (appropriate for heating), generates zero emissions, can be integrated into existing \nnetworks with other heat sources, and is economically viable (with adequate resources). When \nextracted fluids are reinjected, geothermal energy is also renewable. \n \n \n1  International Energy Agency. 2015.

While  low-  and  medium-temperature  geothermal-based  heating  is  commonplace  in \nEurope and other regions, until the 2010s it occupied a limited niche in the PRC.5 Constraints to \nits development have included a lack of awareness of the country\u2019s geothermal resource potential, \ngaps in technical expertise, a lack of relevant policies to spur adoption, and limited experience in \nthe efficient management of heating networks. As a result, in 2015, geothermal energy (including \nboth direct heating and ground source heat pumps) accounted for only 6% of the country\u2019s heated \nfloor space. However, the PRC\u2019s low- to medium-temperature geothermal resource base is vast \nin terms of exploitable energy\u2014at least four times the size of its natural gas reserve base. With \nadvanced technologies and operational know-how, the PRC\u2019s geothermal resources could be \nharnessed on a scale that would potentially heat several hundred cities. \n \n6.  In 2017, the government announced major initiatives to accelerate geothermal adoption \nin the heating sector. The National Energy Administration issued the country\u2019s inaugural five year \nplan for geothermal energy, which targets a tripling of geothermal heating area to 1.1 billion \nsquare meters (m2) by 2020 and thereby the avoidance of 40 million tons per year of coal use.6 \nThe Ministry of Environmental Protection issued the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action \nPlan, which calls for the replacement of coal-fired heating systems in 28 cities in the greater \nBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region7\u2014the country\u2019s worst-polluted area and home to nearly 30% \nof the population\u2014with cleaner alternatives such as geothermal-based heating (footnote 3). \nFinally, the State Council launched the creation of a new economic zone in Xiong\u2019an New Area, \napproximately 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, involving the transfer of a significant portion \nof Beijing\u2019s administrative and business activities to a new urban development of 2,000 square \nkilometers, and announced a decision to heat the area with geothermal energy.8 \n \n7.  SGE, a Sino-Icelandic joint venture, is a leading proponent of geothermal district heating \nin the PRC. SGE is 49% owned by AGE, an Iceland-affiliated geothermal energy company. SGE \nutilizes advanced technologies, based on approaches transferred from Iceland (a country for \nwhich geothermal resources provide 69% of primary energy supply), and has a unique business \nmodel  spanning  upstream  and  downstream  operations.  Established  in  2006,  SGE  has  an \noperating portfolio of 25 cities and a large pipeline of identified opportunities. It collaborates with \nthe government on national geothermal development plans, technology transfer and standards, \nand urban planning for Xiong\u2019an.9 Recognizing the role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nsupporting  the  PRC\u2019s  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  as  well  as  its  track  record  in \nnonsovereign assistance to pioneering urban infrastructure firms, AGE and SGE requested ADB\u2019s \nassistance to scale up SGE\u2019s operations. \n \n2.  Project Design \n8.  The project will support the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of a \nseries of urban district heating systems based on geothermal energy. ADB will extend financing \n \n5  Globally, 28 countries use geothermal district heating, with 60% of installed capacity in Europe (250 city systems). \nEuropean Geothermal Energy Council. 2014.

Completion of the core area of 100 square kilometers is targeted \nby 2022. The geothermal-based heat planned for the area will be provided by SGE. \n9  SGE has been providing heating services to Xiong\u2019an since 2015. Around 70% of new heating area targeted under \nSGE\u2019s business plan is located in the greater BTH region, encompassing Xiong\u2019an and other areas.

Each subproject will involve a concession or similar public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \narrangement with a municipal government, under which SGE would have exclusive rights to \ndevelop geothermal energy resources and network infrastructure, and to deliver heat and related \nservices  (e.g.,  hot  water)  to  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  end  users.  Subproject \ninfrastructure to be developed includes production and reinjection wells, heat centrals, monitoring \nand control stations, and heat trunk lines.11 At each location, the specific configuration of systems \nwill depend on local development and environmental needs as determined by the municipal \ngovernments. Service fees, such as heat tariffs and connection fees, will be set by SGE and \nmunicipal authorities and adjusted as needed during operations. \n \n3.  Borrowers and Sponsors \n \n10.  Sinopec Green Energy Geothermal Development Company Limited. SGE or its wholly \nowned subsidiaries in Hebei and Shaanxi provinces will be the borrowers of the ADB onshore \nloan. SGE was incorporated in 2006 as a Sino-Icelandic joint venture to develop geothermal \nenergy in the PRC.

The project addresses  three of the five \nstrategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020: (i) managing \nclimate change and the environment (in the area of environmental sustainability and pollution \ncontrol), (ii) supporting inclusive economic growth (in the area of inclusive and green cities \ndevelopment), and (iii) private sector development.24 With over 70% of SGE\u2019s investment pipeline \ntargeting the greater BTH region, the project complements ADB\u2019s sovereign initiatives to address \nthe region\u2019s severe air pollution.25 \n \n20.  Consistency with sector policies. The project directly supports two of the three pillars \nof ADB\u2019s Energy Policy: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy (through the \nproject\u2019s support for geothermal energy), and (ii) promoting energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy (through support to expansion and modernization of urban heating systems).26 The project \nalso  supports  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  in  the  plan\u2019s  promotion  of  (i) \ninclusiveness (i.e., through affordable basic services), and (ii) environmental sustainability.27 \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.28 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  For each ADB-funded subproject, SGE will obtain a concession agreement (or \nsimilar arrangement) or licenses to extract geothermal resources and provide \nheating services in a designated area. Each subproject will be implemented in \naccordance with granted approvals and, during construction and operation, be \nsubject to government inspections for various aspects, including environment, land \nacquisition, involuntary resettlement, ethnic minorities, labor, safety, and sanitation. \nManagement  SGE will centralize subproject development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. SGE will undertake projects either through \nprovincial subsidiaries or specific project companies. \nImplementation period  2018\u20132021 \n(construction) \nConstruction arrangements  SGE will centrally coordinate construction of each subproject. For each subproject, \nSGE\u2019s provincial subsidiary or subproject company will enter into contracts with \nsubcontractors to provide geothermal drilling or engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction services. Goods and services will be procured from ADB member \ncountries in a transparent manner through competitive selection, and all contracts \nwill be on a commercial, arm\u2019s-length basis. \nOperations arrangements   \nRevenue structure  SGE will receive from new customers (whether end users or property developers) a \none-off connection fee. For its heating services, SGE will be paid by end users an \nannual payment of heating tariffs. Tariffs are agreed with local authorities and, per \nregulatory guidelines, adjusted periodically to reflect increases in costs. \nMajor cost structure  Major operational costs include electricity, materials, labor, and administrative and \nmaintenance expenses. \n \n24 ADB. 2016.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n22.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to the borrowers consists of two loans to be funded from its \nordinary capital resources: (i) a loan to AGE up to $50 million [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \nDELETED]  and  (ii)  a  loan  to  SGE  up  to  $200  million  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n23.  During the life of the loans, AGE, SGE, and SGE\u2019s subproject companies will be bound \nby covenants stipulated in the loan agreements, including regular monitoring reports on finances, \noperations, and development effectiveness; and requirements to meet minimum financial ratios \ntypical for this type of transaction. \n  \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  ADB would add value through the following: \n \n(i)  as  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  geothermal  district  energy  project,  the  project  is \ndemonstrational  and  catalytic.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  is  expected  to \nestablish more confidence in private sector participation in district heating PPPs in \nthe PRC and the use of renewable energy in heating; \n(ii)  the  project  raises  standards  for  the  PRC  geothermal  industry  by  conditioning \nassistance  on  SGE  meeting  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement; and \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s assistance will lower transaction costs by bundling a series of subprojects in \nmultiple cities, which are often too small and time-consuming for local or international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for ", "  7 \nindigenous peoples.29 A corporate audit of SGE was undertaken by an external third party in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for general corporate finance. \nThe audit found environmental and social impacts associated with construction and operation of \ngeothermal district heating system subprojects typically involve drilling waste management and \ndisposal;  tailwater  management  (where  100%  reinjection  is  not  achieved);  inadequate \noccupational  health  and  safety  monitoring  programs;  temporary  non-major  economic \ndisplacement  during  well  drilling  and  pipe  laying;  and  permanent  non-major  economic \ndisplacement in case of heat central construction in rural villages.30 The institutional capacity and \ncommitment of SGE to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate to meet local and national requirements, but corporate-level capacity development is \nneeded to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n26.  SGE\u2019s  existing  environmental  health  and  safety  system  (EHSS)  is  focused  on  the \noperational environment and health and safety risk management performance of geothermal well \ndrilling, pipe laying and heat central operations. The EHSS meets national requirements and the \nInternational Organization for Standardization 14001 standard.31 The existing system does not, \nhowever, cover corporate-level environmental and social risk and impact appraisal for new \nconcessions, measures for continual improvement (staff training, monitoring and supervision), \ngrievance redressal, or reporting to stakeholders such as ADB. A value addition of the project will \nbe the establishment of a corporate-level ESMS that will operate in parallel with the operational \nsite-level EHSS to meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. SGE has committed \nto implement the ESMS prior to first disbursement. An ESMS framework has been designed in \nconsultation with ADB, and is being refined with external expert assistance to meet SGE's specific \nbusiness needs and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.32 \n \n27.  The independent audit of SGE's operations found no indications of gender discrimination. \nSGE's  human  resource  policy  broadly  follows  that  of  the  Sinopec  Group,  which  prohibits \ndiscrimination of any kind, and is compliant with the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations. Approximately \n40% of SGE's 285 direct employees are female, a share slightly above that of the Sinopec Group \n(36%).  Women  hold  approximately  27%  of  managerial  and  technical  positions  at  SGE\u2019s \nheadquarters,  including  chief  financial  officer  and  chief  technology  officer;  when  including \noperating subsidiaries, 15% of management and technical positions are held by females. Gender \nequality at SGE is supported by AGE, which, as a member of the United Nations Global Compact, \nsubscribes  to  sustainable  and  socially  responsible  policies,  including  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination in respect of employment and occupation. In AGE\u2019s management team, two of six \nmanagement positions are held by females. \n \n28.  The  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.33 AGE and SGE will report annually to ADB on (i) their (and their contractors\u2019) \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be required to be conducted per ADB requirements.34 \n \n29 As AGE\u2019s primary focus is its PRC business, which is conducted solely through its shareholding and management \nrole in SGE, its safeguards policy compliance appraisal is covered in that of SGE. AGE is bound to all environmental \nand social commitments as agreed upon by SGE. \n30 The corporate and subprojects audit was undertaken by a qualified and experienced external expert. \n31 14001 specifies requirements for an organization\u2019s management system to enhance environmental performance.   \n32 Findings  of  the  Corporate  Safeguards  Audit:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2003.
