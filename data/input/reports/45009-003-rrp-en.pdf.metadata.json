THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nemergency assistance loan to Mongolia for the additional financing of the Fifth Health Sector \nDevelopment Project. \n \n2.  The additional financing will support needs related to (i) emergency upgrades of key \nhospital facilities in Ulaanbaatar and other regions to face the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) outbreak and strengthen preparedness for future epidemic and pandemic emergencies, and \n(ii) the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections. It complements ongoing initiatives \nin the health sector in Mongolia. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Description of the emergency. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and \non 11 March 2020 a pandemic.1 Since the outbreak began in mid-January 2020, the Government \nof Mongolia initiated stringent emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus into \nMongolia.  The  measures  include  international  and  national  travel  restrictions;  nonessential \nbusiness closures; public awareness campaigns on the prevention of the spread of the virus; \npreparation  of  hospitals  for  emergencies;  restriction  of  public  gatherings,  meetings,  and \ncelebrations; and the closure of schools. These actions prevented the spread of the virus and, as \nof 27 April 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 38 confirmed cases, 1,687 suspected \ncases under quarantine, and no deaths because of COVID-19. The 38 confirmed cases are \noverseas returnees. The government estimates that more than 150,000 Mongolians are currently \noverseas and of which 7,800 are waiting to return immediately from infected countries. The \ngovernment estimates that about 20% of the population (more than 772,000 people) are at high \nrisk of death from COVID-19 infection. These include the elderly (400,000 people); people with \nchronic  diseases  (350,000  people);  and  others,  including  people  with  cancer, \nimmunocompromised people, and those requiring hemodialysis. \n \n4.  Request for emergency assistance. On 27 March 2020, the Government of Mongolia \nrequested emergency assistance support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \nhealth sector to improve facilities to prevent and manage the current COVID-19 outbreak and \nfuture epidemic and pandemic emergencies. The project meets the requirements for emergency \nassistance financing. \n \n5.  Damage and needs assessment. There are 18,669 hospital beds in Mongolia, of which \n2,916 beds (including 633 with intensive care facilities) are dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. \nHowever, with estimates of about 20% of the population at high risk of death from COVID-19 \ninfection, there is a shortage of essential priority equipment and medical supplies that can address \nthis potential surge of patients. There is a need for ventilators, critical care monitoring equipment, \nambulances,  other  priority  laboratory  equipment  and  supplies,  and  sterilization  services \nnationwide to properly respond to the virus outbreak. Without a stronger disease surveillance and \n \n1 Under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy of the Asian Development Bank , in addition to natural events, \ndisasters may be caused by epidemics. The policy further provides that \u201can emergency occurs after a disaster when \nunforeseen circumstances require immediate action and local capacity is insufficient to address and manage \ntraumatic events.\u201d Furthermore, the policy states that these situations may strain domestic capacity and disrupt \neconomic and social activity. ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. p. 2. \n ", "2 \ndiagnostic system, Mongolia remains vulnerable to a rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 \ncases  and  other  emerging  infectious  diseases  and  public  health  emergencies.  These \nstrengthened surveillance and laboratory capacities are urgently needed given how fast the \nCOVID-19 virus has moved across countries and taking into account how local transmission has \ntaken hold in other developing member countries. There is also a need to respond to existing \nchallenges in the health system\u2019s readiness to respond to large-scale and complex events in an \neffective, efficient, and coordinated way.2 Although large stocks of medical supplies in multiple \nareas within Mongolia were created recently by various international development agencies, this \nwas done on an ad hoc basis in the absence of an integrated system to manage existing stocks \nin a centralized manner. There is also no stock shelf-life extension program in place, and there is \nno plan to address potential future fiscal liabilities in terms of replacement and disposal costs. An \nimproved logistics and warehousing system is immediately needed to ensure efficient distribution \nand use of these medicines and supplies in responding to COVID-19. \n \n6.  WHO\u2019s evaluation of core capacities in Mongolia revealed that preparedness of the \ncountry is limited, particularly in regard to the mapping of potential hazards, the identification and \nmaintenance  of  available  resources  (including  stockpiles),  and  the  capacity  to  support \nintermediate and primary response operations during a public health emergency.3 Mongolia \noperates  most  of  its  responses  under  the  overarching  guidance  provided  by  the  National \nEmergency Commission. The government prepared the National Emergency Response Plan4 \nwith extensive inputs from the international community, led by the United Nations (UN). The plan\u2019s \nkey measures include the level of quarantine needed, closures of borders, the conduct of surveys \nof the current situation, training of health personnel on emergency preparedness, the creation of \na database on the health conditions of people aged 60 and above, and the improvement of health \nfacilities. Initial estimates from the National Emergency Response Plan suggest overall needs are \nabout $240 million, of which $50 million is required for the health sector. \n \n7.  Economic impacts. There is no clear estimate of the economic and financial losses \ncaused by the pandemic on Mongolia. However, gross domestic product growth will be much \nlower in 2020 than envisioned\u2014ADB has revised the 2020 forecast down from 6.0% to 2.1%.5 \nMongolia is a highly vulnerable country with high debt and huge dependence on mineral exports. \nThis will have a major fiscal impact, with total budget revenues already down by 10.6% ($63 \nmillion equivalent) during January\u2013February 2020. This will severely constrain the ability of the \ngovernment to respond to this emergency. The wide range of sectors that have been affected \ninclude small and medium-sized businesses and industries, the service sector (because of travel \nrestrictions and lockdowns), the mining and extractive sector (because of the plunge in commodity \nprices and transport restrictions), and vulnerable segments of the population (due to loss of jobs \nand cutback in wages). In addition, children are impacted mainly because of the closure of the \nschools and the suspension of the government-run children\u2019s food program, which is the main \nnutrition source for more than 440,000 children.  \n \n \n2  WHO. 2017.

The  poverty  rate  in  Mongolia is  estimated  to  be  28.4%.6 Urban \nsubdistricts in Ulaanbaatar are particularly vulnerable, as they have high baseline levels of \npoverty, environmental vulnerability, underemployment, and underinvestment; in addition, they \nhad poor access to services before the epidemic. The rural poor depend on daily farming and \nherding livestock as their main source of income. Most settlements are in desert areas and in \necologically critical areas. \n \n9.  Development partner coordination. A joint health sector committee led by the UN \nResident Coordinator and the MOH is coordinating the COVID-19 emergency response actions \nin Mongolia. The other committee members include UN specialized agencies, ADB, the European \nCommission, the World Bank, embassies with programs in the health sector, and nongovernment \norganizations. This committee also has the mandate to coordinate international assistance to the \nhealth sector. So far, most assistance has been provided by ADB, foreign governments, and UN \nagencies, with the Government of Japan providing testing equipment and UN agencies providing \n$1 million for the purchase of protective equipment for the National Emergency Management \nAgency. The World Bank approved a loan of $26.9 million to support the purchase of medical \nequipment and procurement arrangements will be coordinated with those of the World Bank. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s actions on emergency. In February 2020, ADB redirected $1.4 million in loan \nsavings from an existing loan to procure essential medical equipment for early detection of, \nemergency  care  for,  and  management  of  severe  respiratory  disease.7 All  equipment  was \ndelivered to the government in March 2020. In addition, in March 2020, ADB approved technical \nassistance of $225,000 to assist in strengthening public health risk and resource mapping and \ncoordination, introducing incident management systems, and improving the capacity of health \nworkers on infection prevention and control (IPC) nationally and locally.8 All key experts have \nbeen recruited, and hands-on trainings are ongoing in all 21 aimags.9 On 24 March 2020, ADB \napproved a $1 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund primarily for medical \nsupplies and other initial support required for dealing with the emergency. ADB is also processing \na countercyclical program loan for $100 million under the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option. \nThese interventions are mutually complementary, as the proposed project will support health \nsector needs directly responding to COVID-19, while the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nwill support the Government of Mongolia\u2019s ongoing stimulus initiatives to mitigate the severe \nnegative economic impacts. \n \n11.  The proposed project will also build on ADB\u2019s extensive experience in the health sector in \nMongolia since 1992. ADB is the sector\u2019s lead development partner and has provided 5 loans, 7 \ngrants, and 15 technical assistance projects to the sector, of which two are ongoing projects. \nSome of the key outputs achieved across the health sector portfolio have included (i) a health \nsector master plan; (ii) the introduction of information and communication technology systems for \ntracking health statistics and reporting; (iii) medicine and pharmaceutical procurement reforms; \n(iv) establishment of a health insurance framework; and (v) drafting and enactment of key health \npolicies and laws, including the Health Law, 2016. \n \n \n  \n6 World Bank. 2020 Mongolia Poverty Update.

The original project. ADB approved the Fifth Health Sector Development Project on 10 \nDecember 2012, which became effective on 14 June 2013. At the time of approval, the total \nproject cost was $38.38 million, of which ADB\u2019s share was SDR19,483,000 (equivalent to $30 \nmillion),through a loan from the Asian Development Fund and the government\u2019s counterpart \nfinancing was $7.71 million. WHO provided in-kind parallel cofinancing of $480,000. The project \nhas three components: (i) safe blood transfusion focused on establishing the National Center for \nTransfusion Medicine in Ulaanbaatar, equipping the facilities, systems for safe blood transfusion \nin referral hospitals, and developing blood donor management systems; (ii) medical waste \nmanagement focused on upgrading the medical waste management facilities in selected hospitals \nto meet national standards; and (iii) hospital hygiene and IPC focused on upgrading microbiology \nlaboratories and sterilization departments in tertiary and secondary general hospitals to meet \nnational standards, developing an effective surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections \nand developing capacity of health care workers and administrative staff. The current project \nclosing date is 28 February 2021. \n \n13.  In spite of a start-up delay, the current project has been performing well, as evidenced by \nthe following: \n(i)  The overall project progress is about 93%; component 1 (safe blood transfusion) and \ncomponent 2 (medical waste management) have been completed, while component 3 \n(hospital hygiene and infection prevention control) is 88% complete and is due to be \ncompleted by September 2020. 10 \n(ii)  Seven of the nine original outputs have been achieved and one output was dropped \nat the request of the government; the remaining output is on track to be achieved by \nthe project closing date.11 \n(iii)  The project is rated on track under the project performance system. \n(iv)  The review of safeguards compliance confirmed that the project has no fiduciary or \nsafeguards policy compliance issues and that each safeguard covenant item is being \ncomplied with.  \n(v)  The  management  of  risks  is  rated  successful,  as  all  risks  included  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan have been managed successfully.  \n(vi)  As of March 2020, of the total $27.0 million (90%), $24.4 million has been contracted \nand $22.7 million (84%) has been disbursed.  \n \n14.  Key lessons. Lessons from the current project include the following: \n(i)  The project scope, which involved implementing three components across the entire \ncountry,  was  too  ambitious  and  resulted  in  the  executing  agency,  project \nimplementation unit (PIU), and design and technical consultants being spread too thin \ntrying to supervise and coordinate design, civil works, and equipment installations at \ntoo many sites. \n(ii)  A lack of coordination between the design and technical consultants in upgrading the \nlaboratories  and  central  sterilization  service  departments  led  to  alterations  in \nspecifications, resulting in unforeseen additional costs and delays in the civil works. \n(iii)  Frequent turnover of government staff resulted in regular changes of bid evaluation \ncommittees. \nThe Mongolia Resident Mission will closely work with the MOH to ensure the above issues in the \ncurrent project are addressed up-front for the additional financing. \n \n \n10 At the government request, nine more central sterilization service departments in eight additional hospitals was \nadded to the project scope in 2019. \n11 Pending the completion of the upgrades of the hospitals\u2019 sterilization departments in eight additional projects sites.  \n ", "5 \n15.  The additional financing. The additional financing will support component 3 through (i) \nincreasing the number of project sites for upgrading sterilization departments to cover all referral \n(secondary and tertiary) hospitals nationwide; (ii) increasing the capacity of hospitals to diagnose \nand  treat  COVID-19  patients  and  other  severe  acute  respiratory  infection  (SARI)  patients, \nincluding by providing intensive care and ambulance services; (iii) improving diagnostic capacity \nfor COVID-19 and SARI at the National Center for Communicable Diseases and hospitals in \nborder aimags with a high risk of imported cases; and (iv) establishing a warehouse facility to \nmaintain and manage centralized stockpiles of medicines and medical devices for emergency \nsituations in Ulaanbaatar. ADB will coordinate closely with development partners through the \nhealth sector committee to identify synergies and avoid duplication. \n \n16.  Choice of Modality. The proposed additional financing meets all eligibility requirements \nfor an emergency assistance loan (EAL) per para. 15 of OM D7 as follows: (i) the government\u2019s \nrequest for assistance has been received (para. 4); (ii) potential impact on social needs and \npriorities has been identified in a damage and needs assessment; (iii) COVID-19 pandemic \ninvolves significant economic dislocation and the proposed EAL is intended to address immediate \nneeds; (iv) no security risks to ADB staff are anticipated; and (v) the level of burden and risk \nsharing among the stakeholders is appropriate. 12  \n \n17.  Impact of the additional financing. The overall project will remain technically and \neconomically viable, and financially sustainable with the additional financing. The safeguards \ncategorization of the overall project will also remain unchanged. The additional financing will \nenhance the current project\u2019s original design and add effective support for the development of the \nhealth sector. The additional financing will support the achievement of the impact and outcome of \nthe  project,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  emergency  preparedness  in  health  sector \ndevelopment in Mongolia. \n \n18.  Processing  under  the  Fifth  Health  Sector  Development  Project.  The  proposed \nadditional financing also meets the following qualifying criteria as set out in the current project: (i) \nthe project scope includes improvement of IPC measures in health care facilities; (ii) the short \nstart-up period ensures project readiness, which is ideal for a post-disaster transition and recovery \nperiod; (iii) the performance of the project is satisfactory and outputs have almost been completed; \n(iv) the MOH and PIU are fully staffed, familiar with ADB processes, and the additional financing \nactivities will scale up component 3 of the current project; and (v) the project is classified category \nB for environment and C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact and the outcome of the overall project remain unchanged from the current \nproject. The project is aligned with the following impact: improved quality of health services in \nMongolia.13 The project will have the following outcome: improved patient and health worker \nsafety in project-supported hospitals in Mongolia.14 The overall project\u2019s geographical focus will \ninclude referral hospitals in Ulaanbaatar and aimag centers. \n \n20.

The additional \nfinancing will increase diagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals to manage COVID-19 and \nSARI  patients  (new  output  10),  establish  a  national  medical  countermeasures  stockpile  in \nUlaanbaatar (new output 11), and expand the project sites for upgrading sterilization departments \nin tertiary and secondary hospitals nationwide (output 6)\u2014all under component 3. All other \noutputs of the current project have been completed. \n \n22.  The  outputs  of  the  overall  project  are  grouped  under  three  components.  The  3 \ncomponents and the 11 outputs are as follows: \n  Component  1:  Safe  blood  transfusion.  The  current  project  has  assisted  the \ngovernment  in  establishing  the  National  Center  for  Transfusion  Medicine  in \nUlaanbaatar by building a new facility, providing equipment, improving management \nsystems,  implementing  capacity  building  measures,  and  obtaining  international \naccreditation (output 1). It has also improved safe blood transfusion in aimag general \nhospitals nationwide and selected soums (districts) by upgrading facilities; providing \nequipment; training personnel; and organizing blood donor management systems, \nincluding public awareness (output 2). \n  Component 2: Medical waste management. The current project has strengthened \nthe  medical  waste  management  system  in  selected  hospitals  to  meet  national \nstandards  by  upgrading  facilities,  providing  equipment,  updating  standards  and \nprotocols, and training personnel (output 4). Expansion of the central medical waste \nmanagement facility (output 3) was canceled at the request of the government. \n  Component 3: Hospital hygiene and infection prevention and control. The current \nproject  has  upgraded  microbiology  laboratories  (output  5)  and  sterilization \ndepartments (output 6) in tertiary and secondary general hospitals to meet national \nstandards by upgrading infrastructure, providing equipment, and training personnel. \nThe current project developed and institutionalized an effective surveillance system \nfor hospital-acquired infections (output 7); strengthened awareness, knowledge, and \ncapacity of health authorities, health care workers and administrative staff on IPC \n(output 8); and assisted in the incorporation of IPC in hospital quality management \nsystems (output 9).  \n  The additional financing, under Component 3, will (a) expand project sites under output \n6 to cover all referral (secondary and tertiary) hospitals nationwide; (b) increase the \ncapacity of hospitals to diagnose and treat COVID-19 and SARI patients, including by \nproviding  intensive  care  and  ambulance  services  (new  output  10);  (c)  improve \ndiagnostic capacity for COVID-19 and SARI at the National Center for Communicable \nDiseases and hospitals in border aimags with a high risk of imported cases; and (d) \nestablish  a  warehouse facility  to  maintain  and  manage  centralized  stockpiles  of \nmedicines and medical devices for emergency situations in Ulaanbaatar (new output \n11).  \n \n ", "7 \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. The arrangement is similar to the current project and will use the existing PIU. \n  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2020\u2013April 2022  \nEstimated completion date  31 October 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 April 2022 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee (which will be expanded to cover the additional \nfinancing) \nVice minister of health (chair)  \nSenior officials from the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of \nLabor and Social Welfare; Ministry of Nature, Environment, and Tourism; \nState Social Insurance General Office; Ulaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office; \nGeneral Agency for Specialized Inspection; Health Sciences University of \nMongolia; Pharmaceutical Association of Mongolia; Hospital Association of \nMongolia; Mongolian Consumer Association; and Mongolian Association of \nFamily Doctors (members).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  All project components will be designed taking into account local conditions and following \nrelevant national guidelines. The project plans to procure similar equipment to existing equipment \nbeing  procured  by  development  partners  and  WHO,  which  will  minimize  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) risks such as spare parts and training. Maintenance services will be included \n ", "9 \nin the supply contracts; strengthening of maintenance services, planned under the project, will \nenhance local capacities for O&M of supplied equipment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Mongolia will suffer significant economic impacts because of COVID-19, with estimated \nlosses amounting to $71 to $276 million.17 The number of infected is 1.5 million globally and \ndeaths reached 92,798 (as of 10 April 2020).18  In the short run, the virus overwhelms the existing \nhealth system, which is unable to cope with the increased need for intensive care, protective \nequipment, and human resources.  In Mongolia, COVID-19  has impacted economic activity \nthrough various channels, including declines in domestic consumption, production, investment, \ntrade and tourism receipts, as a result of stringent measures enacted to contain the spread of the \nvirus. In the short to medium run, COVID-19 will lead to higher unemployment and continued \ndisruption  of  schooling,  with  likely  detrimental  effects  on  human  capital  development.  As \nevidenced across the region, COVID-19 also has debilitating effects on community systems and \nresilience through additional deaths and increased morbidities. The project outputs are expected \nto generate benefits that will mitigate loss of human capital, and address short-term gaps and \ndeficiencies in the health system.  ADB is conducting an economic analysis prior to loan approval \nto ensure the cost-effectiveness and viability of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance. \n \n28.  Project outputs are public service goods with no opportunity for cost recovery, so no \nfinancial viability assessment is required. The equipment procured and medical warehouse facility \nwill be maintained using the relevant ministries\u2019 ongoing recurrent budget. The current project \nconsidered an average depreciation value of $2 million per annum for the equipment, under which \nthe recurrent cost impact would be $2.4 million per annum, representing about 1% of the total \nrecurrent costs of 2011. The counterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both financially \nsustainable and affordable. A loan covenant makes provision for adequate counterpart funding. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  The MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, and has been actively involved in implementing \nhealth sector development projects since 1991. A PIU was established as part of the current \nproject. \n \n30.  Based on the original procurement assessment of the executing agency and the PIU, and \nsubsequent procurement carried out under the current project, the executing agency and the PIU \nhave demonstrated their general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy \nand procedural requirements and national laws and regulations on public procurement. The \nimplementing  agencies  have  procurement  experience  using  ADB  policies  and  procedural \nrequirements. However, to expedite implementation and coordination with other development \npartner assistance, all procurement under the project will be carried out by the executing agency \nand coordinated by the PIU. The government has advised that it does not wish to apply universal \nprocurement for the project and that the required goods, works, and services can readily be \nsourced from ADB member countries. Therefore, the loan documents will provide that universal \nprocurement will not be required for the project unless ADB determines, during implementation, \nthat universal procurement is required for efficient procurement of goods, works, or services to \nachieve the purposes of the loan. \n \n17 ADB. 2020.

London: \nImperial College. \n ", "10 \n31.  Similarly, based on the financial management assessments of MOH and the National \nCenter for Communicable Diseases, and subsequent assessments carried out under the current \nproject, these two agencies have adequate accounting professionals and have computerized \nfinancial accounting and reporting systems. Procedures on the flow of accounting, financial, and \nproject physical progress related to the current project activities are available. All the agencies \nhave clearly defined responsibilities, with accountability assigned to different units at different \nlevels of authority. \n \n32.  The  National  Audit  Office  will  arrange  annual  audits  for  the  project.  The  financial \nmanagement assessments concluded that the financial management systems in the executing \nand implementing agencies meets government requirements in terms of staffing, accounting, and \ninternal control. The PIU  staff will implement the project in compliance with  ADB\u2019s policy, \noperation, and procedural requirements. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  The project will improve emergency preparedness during epidemics and pandemics and \nhealth workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. The additional financing will benefit directly the \n20% of the population that are at high risk of death from COVID-19 infection, and about 13,500 \nhealth workers will also benefit directly, especially those with professions that put them at \noccupational risk due to COVID-19 pandemic. The additional financing will provide gender and \nculturally sensitive information, education and awareness raising, and communication on the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n \n35.  Gender.  The  original  project  is  classified  effective  gender mainstreaming  and most \nactivities under the gender action plan are at the final stages of successful completion. Activities \ninclude sex-disaggregated data collection, gender-sensitive public outreach, targets for women\u2019s \nparticipation in training events, and career development of  female health workers. Women \nconstitute  82%  of  the health  care  workforce. Women  are  commonly responsible  for  blood \nprocessing, IPC, waste management and handling, cleaning, and disinfection; and are the most \nexposed  to  hospital-acquired  infections  and  transfusion-transmitted  infections.  Women  also \nconstitute about 80% of hospital patients. To ensure that women continue to access medical \nservices during the pandemic, the MOH is reviewing medical protocols periodically based on \nWHO advice. As such, medical services directly responding to women\u2019s needs (e.g., obstetrics) \nremain in full operation. Under the additional financing, women health frontline workers (doctors \nand nurses) will be trained on the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-\n19 and SARI. This will ensure that patients receive adequate treatment and that health frontline \nworkers are fully cognizant of personal safety protocols. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  Environment. The additional financing is categorized C for environment. Although the \nproposed activities under the additional financing will not have any direct environmental impacts, \nsome impacts relating to the construction of the warehouse facility are likely, but these will be \nminimal and will be within the boundaries of an existing health facility in Ulaanbaatar. The likely \nimpacts of this construction will be addressed through developing an environmental management \nplan (EMP) to address localized adverse impacts and risks during the construction phase. The \n ", "11 \nEMP of the current project will also updated for any risks related to unsafe collection, storage, \ntreatment, and disposal of medical and chemical liquid waste generated by health facilities. \n \n37.  The EMP contained in the PAM will be updated based on the final design of the proposed \nwarehouse facility and will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to awarding the civil \nworks contract. Contractors (during construction) and facility operators and the MOH (during \noperation) will implement these measures. The Government of Mongolia, through the MOH, is \ncommitted to managing identified environmental risks and has agreed on a comprehensive set of \nloan covenants. The additional financing project will have significant environmental, health, and \nsafety benefits. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Similar to the current project, the \nadditional financing will not trigger involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguard \nrequirements and is classified category C for both social safeguard areas. Project activities will \nnot involve land acquisition, and any civil works will likely be confined to project facilities\u2019 existing \nlands or government-owned lands. The proposed site for the new warehouse facility is known to \nbe government-owned land. If any resettlement impacts are unavoidable for any project activities, \nthe borrower shall inform ADB, prepare a resettlement plan for such activities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  carry  out  any  such  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  approved \nresettlement plan. All ethnic groups will have equal opportunities to avail themselves of and \naccess benefits from the project, if they require health and medical attention. The project will \nimplement effective ways to design and deliver information, education, and communication \nactivities  to  the  public  to  promote  social  inclusiveness  and  effective \ncommunication. Dissemination of COVID-19 messages within communities will be conducted in \nboth the Mongolian language and local languages. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of government investment, late assignment  A loan covenant makes provision for the government\u2019s inclusion \nof staff, and insufficient allocation of recurrent  of appropriate recurrent funds in yearly budgets submitted for \nfunds   MOF endorsement and Parliament approval. ADB and the PIU \nwill monitor inclusion of costs in the MOH\u2019s budget. \nDelay in procurement   The PIU and procurement consultant will provide support to the \nMOH in preparing technical specifications and during the \nbidding process. \nCorrupt practices and related risks in financial  MOH will support strengthening audit systems, implement spot \nmanagement and procurement  reviews of procurement and financial procedures, make \nprocurement awards public, and provide procurement and \nfinancial management training to staff. \nUnsustainable implementing capacity   ADB, through the current project, will continue to provide \n  support to further strengthen the capacity of the MOH.
