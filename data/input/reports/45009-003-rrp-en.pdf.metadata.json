It complements ongoing initiatives \nin the health sector in Mongolia. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nDescription  of  the  emergency.  On  30  January  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and \non 11 March 2020 a pandemic.1 Since the outbreak began in mid-January 2020, the Government \nof  Mongolia  initiated  stringent  emergency  measures  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus  into \nMongolia.  The  measures  include  international  and  national  travel  restrictions;  nonessential \nbusiness  closures;  public  awareness  campaigns  on  the  prevention  of  the  spread  of  the  virus; \npreparation  of  hospitals  for  emergencies;  restriction  of  public  gatherings,  meetings,  and \ncelebrations; and the closure of schools. These actions prevented the spread of the virus and, as \nof  27  April  2020,  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  reported  38  confirmed  cases,  1,687  suspected \ncases  under  quarantine,  and  no  deaths  because  of  COVID-19.  The  38  confirmed  cases  are \noverseas returnees. The government estimates that more than 150,000 Mongolians are currently \noverseas  and  of  which  7,800  are  waiting  to  return  immediately  from  infected  countries.  The \ngovernment estimates that about 20% of the population (more than 772,000 people) are at high \nrisk of death from COVID-19 infection. These include the elderly (400,000 people); people with \nchronic  diseases \nincluding  people  with  cancer, \nimmunocompromised people, and those requiring hemodialysis. \n \nRequest for emergency assistance. On 27 March 2020, the Government of Mongolia \n4. \nrequested emergency assistance support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \nhealth  sector  to  improve  facilities  to  prevent  and  manage  the  current  COVID-19  outbreak  and \nfuture epidemic and pandemic emergencies. The project meets the requirements for emergency \nassistance financing. \n \n5. \nDamage and needs assessment. There are 18,669 hospital beds in Mongolia, of which \n2,916  beds  (including  633  with  intensive  care  facilities)  are  dedicated  to  COVID-19  treatment. \nHowever,  with  estimates  of  about  20%  of  the  population  at  high  risk  of  death  from  COVID-19 \ninfection, there is a shortage of essential priority equipment and medical supplies that can address \nthis potential surge of patients. There is a need for ventilators, critical care monitoring equipment, \nambulances,  other  priority  laboratory  equipment  and  supplies,  and  sterilization  services \nnationwide to properly respond to the virus outbreak. Without a stronger disease surveillance and \n\n(350,000  people);  and  others, \n\n \n\n1 Under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy of the Asian Development Bank , in addition to natural events, \ndisasters may be caused by epidemics. The policy further provides that \u201can emergency occurs after a disaster when \nunforeseen  circumstances  require  immediate  action  and  local  capacity  is  insufficient  to  address  and  manage \ntraumatic  events.\u201d  Furthermore,  the  policy  states  that  these  situations  may  strain  domestic  capacity  and  disrupt \neconomic and social activity. ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. p. 2. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndiagnostic  system,  Mongolia  remains  vulnerable  to  a  rapidly  increasing  number  of  COVID-19 \ncases  and  other  emerging  infectious  diseases  and  public  health  emergencies.  These \nstrengthened  surveillance  and  laboratory  capacities  are  urgently  needed  given  how  fast  the \nCOVID-19 virus has moved across countries and taking into account how local transmission has \ntaken  hold  in  other  developing  member  countries.  There  is  also  a  need to  respond to  existing \nchallenges in the health system\u2019s readiness to respond to large-scale and complex events in an \neffective, efficient, and coordinated way.2 Although large stocks of medical supplies in multiple \nareas within Mongolia were created recently by various international development agencies, this \nwas done on an ad hoc basis in the absence of an integrated system to manage existing stocks \nin a centralized manner. There is also no stock shelf-life extension program in place, and there is \nno plan to address potential future fiscal liabilities in terms of replacement and disposal costs. An \nimproved logistics and warehousing system is immediately needed to ensure efficient distribution \nand use of these medicines and supplies in responding to COVID-19. \n \n6. \nWHO\u2019s  evaluation  of  core  capacities  in  Mongolia  revealed  that  preparedness  of  the \ncountry is limited, particularly in regard to the mapping of potential hazards, the identification and \nmaintenance  of  available  resources  (including  stockpiles),  and  the  capacity  to  support \nintermediate  and  primary  response  operations  during  a  public  health  emergency. 3 Mongolia \noperates  most  of  its  responses  under  the  overarching  guidance  provided  by  the  National \nEmergency  Commission.  The  government  prepared  the  National  Emergency  Response  Plan4 \nwith extensive inputs from the international community, led by the United Nations (UN). The plan\u2019s \nkey measures include the level of quarantine needed, closures of borders, the conduct of surveys \nof the current situation, training of health personnel on emergency preparedness, the creation of \na database on the health conditions of people aged 60 and above, and the improvement of health \nfacilities. Initial estimates from the National Emergency Response Plan suggest overall needs are \nabout $240 million, of which $50 million is required for the health sector. \n \n7. \nEconomic  impacts.  There  is  no  clear  estimate  of  the  economic  and  financial  losses \ncaused  by  the  pandemic  on  Mongolia.  However,  gross  domestic  product  growth  will  be  much \nlower in 2020 than envisioned\u2014ADB has revised the 2020 forecast down from 6.0% to 2.1%.5 \nMongolia is a highly vulnerable country with high debt and huge dependence on mineral exports. \nThis  will  have  a  major  fiscal  impact,  with  total  budget  revenues  already  down  by  10.6%  ($63 \nmillion equivalent) during January\u2013February 2020. This will severely constrain the ability of the \ngovernment  to respond to this  emergency.  The wide  range  of  sectors that  have  been  affected \ninclude small and medium-sized businesses and industries, the service sector (because of travel \nrestrictions and lockdowns), the mining and extractive sector (because of the plunge in commodity \nprices and transport restrictions), and vulnerable segments of the population (due to loss of jobs \nand cutback in wages). In addition, children are impacted mainly because of the closure of the \nschools and the suspension of the government-run children\u2019s food program, which is the main \nnutrition source for more than 440,000 children.  \n \n\n \n\n2  WHO. 2017.

Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila; and ADB. 2020. Asian \n\nDevelopment Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation in Asia? Manila. \n\n\fPoverty  impacts.  The  poverty  rate  in  Mongolia is  estimated  to  be  28.4%. 6  Urban \n8. \nsubdistricts  in  Ulaanbaatar  are  particularly  vulnerable,  as  they  have  high  baseline  levels  of \npoverty,  environmental  vulnerability,  underemployment,  and  underinvestment;  in  addition,  they \nhad poor access to services before the epidemic. The rural poor depend on daily farming and \nherding  livestock  as their main  source  of  income. Most  settlements  are  in  desert  areas  and  in \necologically critical areas. \n \n9. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  A  joint  health  sector  committee  led  by  the  UN \nResident Coordinator and the MOH is coordinating the COVID-19 emergency response actions \nin Mongolia. The other committee members include UN specialized agencies, ADB, the European \nCommission, the World Bank, embassies with programs in the health sector, and nongovernment \norganizations. This committee also has the mandate to coordinate international assistance to the \nhealth sector. So far, most assistance has been provided by ADB, foreign governments, and UN \nagencies, with the Government of Japan providing testing equipment and UN agencies providing \n$1  million  for  the  purchase  of  protective  equipment  for  the  National  Emergency  Management \nAgency.  The  World  Bank  approved  a  loan  of  $26.9 million  to  support  the  purchase  of medical \nequipment and procurement arrangements will be coordinated with those of the World Bank. \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  actions  on  emergency.  In  February  2020,  ADB  redirected  $1.4  million  in  loan \nsavings  from  an  existing  loan  to  procure  essential  medical  equipment  for  early  detection  of, \nemergency  care  for,  and  management  of  severe  respiratory  disease. 7  All  equipment  was \ndelivered to the government in March 2020. In addition, in March 2020, ADB approved technical \nassistance of $225,000 to assist in strengthening public health risk and resource  mapping and \ncoordination,  introducing  incident  management  systems,  and  improving  the  capacity  of  health \nworkers  on  infection  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  nationally  and  locally.8 All  key  experts  have \nbeen recruited, and hands-on trainings are ongoing in all 21 aimags.9 On 24 March 2020, ADB \napproved a $1 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund primarily for medical \nsupplies and other initial support required for dealing with the emergency. ADB is also processing \na countercyclical program loan for $100 million under the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option. \nThese  interventions  are  mutually  complementary,  as  the  proposed  project  will  support  health \nsector needs directly responding to COVID-19, while the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nwill  support  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  ongoing  stimulus  initiatives  to  mitigate  the  severe \nnegative economic impacts. \n \n11. \nThe proposed project will also build on ADB\u2019s extensive experience in the health sector in \nMongolia since 1992. ADB is the sector\u2019s lead development partner and has provided 5 loans, 7 \ngrants,  and  15  technical  assistance  projects  to  the  sector,  of  which  two  are  ongoing  projects. \nSome of the key outputs achieved across the health sector portfolio have included (i) a health \nsector master plan; (ii) the introduction of information and communication technology systems for \ntracking health statistics and reporting; (iii) medicine and pharmaceutical procurement reforms; \n(iv) establishment of a health insurance framework; and (v) drafting and enactment of key health \npolicies and laws, including the Health Law, 2016. \n \n\n \n\n6  World Bank. 2020 Mongolia Poverty Update.

ADB approved the Fifth Health Sector Development Project on 10 \n12. \nDecember  2012,  which  became  effective  on  14  June  2013.  At  the  time  of  approval,  the  total \nproject cost was $38.38 million, of which ADB\u2019s share was SDR19,483,000 (equivalent to $30 \nmillion),through  a  loan  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  the  government\u2019s  counterpart \nfinancing was $7.71 million. WHO provided in-kind parallel cofinancing of $480,000. The project \nhas three components: (i) safe blood transfusion focused on establishing the National Center for \nTransfusion Medicine in Ulaanbaatar, equipping the facilities, systems for safe blood transfusion \nin  referral  hospitals,  and  developing  blood  donor  management  systems;  (ii)  medical  waste \nmanagement focused on upgrading the medical waste management facilities in selected hospitals \nto meet national standards; and (iii) hospital hygiene and IPC focused on upgrading microbiology \nlaboratories  and  sterilization  departments  in  tertiary  and  secondary  general  hospitals  to  meet \nnational standards, developing an effective surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections \nand  developing  capacity  of  health  care  workers  and  administrative  staff.  The  current  project \nclosing date is 28 February 2021. \n \n13. \nthe following: \n\nIn spite of a start-up delay, the current project has been performing well, as evidenced by \n\nThe overall project progress is about 93%; component 1 (safe blood transfusion) and \ncomponent 2 (medical waste management) have been completed, while component 3 \n(hospital hygiene and infection prevention control) is 88% complete and is due to be \ncompleted by September 2020. 10 \nSeven of the nine original outputs have been achieved and one output was dropped \nat the request of the government; the remaining output is on track to be achieved by \nthe project closing date.11 \nThe project is rated on track under the project performance system. \nThe review of safeguards compliance confirmed that the project has no fiduciary  or \nsafeguards policy compliance issues and that each safeguard covenant item is being \ncomplied with.  \nThe  management  of  risks  is  rated  successful,  as  all  risks  included  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan have been managed successfully.  \nAs of March 2020, of the total $27.0 million (90%), $24.4 million has been contracted \nand $22.7 million (84%) has been disbursed.  \n\nKey lessons. Lessons from the current project include the following: \n\nin \n\ntoo  ambitious  and  resulted \n\nThe project scope, which involved implementing three components across the entire \ncountry,  was \nthe  executing  agency,  project \nimplementation unit (PIU), and design and technical consultants being spread too thin \ntrying to supervise and coordinate design, civil works, and equipment installations at \ntoo many sites. \nA lack of coordination between the design and technical consultants in upgrading the \nlaboratories  and  central  sterilization  service  departments  led  to  alterations  in \nspecifications, resulting in unforeseen additional costs and delays in the civil works. \nFrequent turnover of government staff resulted in regular changes of bid evaluation \ncommittees. \n\nThe Mongolia Resident Mission will closely work with the MOH to ensure the above issues in the \ncurrent project are addressed up-front for the additional financing. \n \n\n \n\n10 At  the  government  request,  nine  more  central  sterilization  service  departments  in  eight  additional  hospitals  was \n\nadded to the project scope in 2019. \n\n11 Pending the completion of the upgrades of the hospitals\u2019 sterilization departments in eight additional projects sites.  \n\n\fThe additional financing. The additional financing will support component 3 through (i) \n15. \nincreasing the number of project sites for upgrading sterilization departments to cover all referral \n(secondary and tertiary) hospitals nationwide; (ii) increasing the capacity of hospitals to diagnose \nand  treat  COVID-19  patients  and  other  severe  acute  respiratory  infection  (SARI)  patients, \nincluding by providing intensive care and ambulance services; (iii) improving diagnostic capacity \nfor  COVID-19  and  SARI  at  the  National  Center  for  Communicable  Diseases  and  hospitals  in \nborder  aimags  with  a  high  risk  of  imported  cases;  and  (iv)  establishing a  warehouse  facility to \nmaintain  and  manage  centralized  stockpiles  of  medicines  and  medical  devices  for  emergency \nsituations  in  Ulaanbaatar.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  development  partners  through  the \nhealth sector committee to identify synergies and avoid duplication. \n \n16. \nChoice of Modality. The proposed additional financing meets all eligibility requirements \nfor an emergency assistance loan (EAL) per para. 15 of OM D7 as follows: (i) the government\u2019s \nrequest  for  assistance  has  been  received  (para.  4);  (ii)  potential  impact  on  social  needs  and \npriorities  has  been  identified  in  a  damage  and  needs  assessment;  (iii)  COVID-19  pandemic \ninvolves significant economic dislocation and the proposed EAL is intended to address immediate \nneeds;  (iv)  no  security  risks  to  ADB  staff  are  anticipated;  and  (v)  the  level  of  burden  and  risk \nsharing among the stakeholders is appropriate. 12  \n \n17. \nImpact  of  the  additional  financing.  The  overall  project  will  remain  technically  and \neconomically  viable,  and  financially  sustainable  with  the  additional  financing.  The  safeguards \ncategorization  of  the  overall  project  will  also  remain  unchanged.  The  additional  financing  will \nenhance the current project\u2019s original design and add effective support for the development of the \nhealth sector. The additional financing will support the achievement of the impact and outcome of \nthe  project,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  emergency  preparedness  in  health  sector \ndevelopment in Mongolia. \n \nProcessing  under  the  Fifth  Health  Sector  Development  Project.  The  proposed \n18. \nadditional financing also meets the following qualifying criteria as set out in the current project: (i) \nthe project scope includes improvement of  IPC measures in health care facilities; (ii)  the short \nstart-up period ensures project readiness, which is ideal for a post-disaster transition and recovery \nperiod; (iii) the performance of the project is satisfactory and outputs have almost been completed; \n(iv) the MOH and PIU are fully staffed, familiar with ADB processes, and the additional financing \nactivities will scale up component 3 of the current project; and (v) the project is classified category \nB for environment and C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe  impact  and  the  outcome  of  the  overall  project  remain  unchanged  from  the  current \nproject.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the following  impact:  improved  quality  of  health  services  in \nMongolia.13 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  patient  and  health  worker \nsafety in project-supported hospitals in Mongolia.14 The overall project\u2019s geographical focus will \ninclude referral hospitals in Ulaanbaatar and aimag centers. \n \n20. \nThe  additional  financing  will  increase  the  quality  of  health  services  for  emergency \npreparedness for epidemics and pandemics in Mongolia to face the COVID-19 pandemic and will \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n12 ADB. 2015.

The  additional \nfinancing will increase diagnostic and treatment capacity of hospitals to manage COVID-19 and \nSARI  patients  (new  output  10),  establish  a  national  medical  countermeasures  stockpile  in \nUlaanbaatar (new output 11), and expand the project sites for upgrading sterilization departments \nin  tertiary  and  secondary  hospitals  nationwide  (output  6)\u2014all  under  component  3.  All  other \noutputs of the current project have been completed. \n \n22. \ncomponents and the 11 outputs are as follows: \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  overall  project  are  grouped  under  three  components.  The  3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nComponent  1:  Safe  blood  transfusion.  The  current  project  has  assisted  the \ngovernment  in  establishing  the  National  Center  for  Transfusion  Medicine  in \nUlaanbaatar by building a new facility, providing equipment, improving management \nsystems,  implementing  capacity  building  measures,  and  obtaining  international \naccreditation (output 1). It has also improved safe blood transfusion in aimag general \nhospitals nationwide and selected soums (districts) by upgrading facilities; providing \nequipment;  training  personnel;  and  organizing  blood  donor  management  systems, \nincluding public awareness (output 2). \nComponent 2: Medical waste management. The current project has strengthened \nthe  medical  waste  management  system  in  selected  hospitals  to  meet  national \nstandards  by  upgrading  facilities,  providing  equipment,  updating  standards  and \nprotocols, and training personnel (output 4). Expansion of the central medical waste \nmanagement facility (output 3) was canceled at the request of the government. \nComponent 3: Hospital hygiene and infection prevention and control. The current \nlaboratories  (output  5)  and  sterilization \nproject  has  upgraded  microbiology \ndepartments  (output  6)  in  tertiary  and  secondary  general  hospitals to meet  national \nstandards  by  upgrading infrastructure,  providing  equipment,  and training personnel. \nThe  current  project  developed  and  institutionalized  an  effective surveillance  system \nfor hospital-acquired infections (output 7); strengthened awareness, knowledge, and \ncapacity  of  health  authorities,  health  care  workers  and  administrative  staff  on  IPC \n(output  8);  and  assisted  in  the  incorporation  of  IPC  in  hospital  quality  management \nsystems (output 9).  \nThe additional financing, under Component 3, will (a) expand project sites under output \n6 to cover all referral (secondary and tertiary) hospitals nationwide; (b) increase the \ncapacity of hospitals to diagnose and treat COVID-19 and SARI patients, including by \nproviding  intensive  care  and  ambulance  services  (new  output  10);  (c)  improve \ndiagnostic capacity for COVID-19 and SARI at the National Center for Communicable \nDiseases and hospitals in border aimags with a high risk of imported cases; and (d) \nestablish  a  warehouse  facility  to  maintain  and  manage  centralized  stockpiles  of \nmedicines and medical devices for emergency situations in Ulaanbaatar (new output \n11).  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $72.62  million  (Table  1).

Mongolia will suffer significant economic impacts because of COVID-19, with estimated \nlosses  amounting  to  $71  to  $276  million.17 The  number  of  infected  is  1.5  million  globally  and \ndeaths reached 92,798 (as of 10 April 2020).18  In the short run, the virus overwhelms the existing \nhealth  system,  which  is  unable  to  cope  with  the  increased  need  for  intensive  care,  protective \nequipment,  and  human  resources.  In  Mongolia,  COVID-19   has  impacted  economic  activity \nthrough various channels, including declines in domestic consumption, production, investment, \ntrade and tourism receipts, as a result of stringent measures enacted to contain the spread of the \nvirus.  In  the  short  to  medium  run,  COVID-19  will  lead  to  higher  unemployment  and  continued \ndisruption  of  schooling,  with  likely  detrimental  effects  on  human  capital  development.  As \nevidenced across the region, COVID-19 also has debilitating effects on community systems and \nresilience through additional deaths and increased morbidities. The project outputs are expected \nto  generate  benefits  that  will  mitigate  loss  of  human  capital,  and  address  short-term  gaps  and \ndeficiencies in the health system.  ADB is conducting an economic analysis prior to loan approval \nto ensure the cost-effectiveness and viability of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance. \n \nProject  outputs  are  public  service  goods  with  no  opportunity  for  cost  recovery,  so  no \n28. \nfinancial viability assessment is required. The equipment procured and medical warehouse facility \nwill  be  maintained  using  the  relevant  ministries\u2019  ongoing  recurrent  budget.  The  current  project \nconsidered an average depreciation value of $2 million per annum for the equipment, under which \nthe recurrent cost impact would be $2.4 million per annum, representing about 1% of the total \nrecurrent costs of 2011. The counterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both financially \nsustainable and affordable. A loan covenant makes provision for adequate counterpart funding. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, and has been actively involved in implementing \nhealth  sector  development  projects  since  1991.  A  PIU  was  established  as  part  of  the  current \nproject. \n \n30. \nBased on the original procurement assessment of the executing agency and the PIU, and \nsubsequent procurement carried out under the current project, the executing agency and the PIU \nhave demonstrated their general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy \nand  procedural  requirements  and  national  laws  and  regulations  on  public  procurement.  The \nimplementing  agencies  have  procurement  experience  using  ADB  policies  and  procedural \nrequirements.  However,  to  expedite  implementation  and  coordination  with  other  development \npartner assistance, all procurement under the project will be carried out by the executing agency \nand coordinated by the PIU. The government has advised that it does not wish to apply universal \nprocurement  for  the  project  and  that  the  required  goods,  works,  and  services  can  readily  be \nsourced from ADB member countries. Therefore, the loan documents will provide that universal \nprocurement will not be required for the project unless ADB determines, during implementation, \nthat universal procurement is required for efficient procurement of goods, works, or services to \nachieve the purposes of the loan. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n17 ADB. 2020.

Procedures on the flow of accounting, financial, and \nproject physical progress related to the current project activities are available. All the agencies \nhave  clearly  defined  responsibilities,  with  accountability  assigned  to  different  units  at  different \nlevels of authority. \n \nThe  National  Audit  Office  will  arrange  annual  audits  for  the  project.  The  financial \n32. \nmanagement assessments concluded that the financial management systems in the executing \nand implementing agencies meets government requirements in terms of staffing, accounting, and \ninternal  control.  The  PIU  staff  will  implement  the  project  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy, \noperation, and procedural requirements. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nThe project will improve emergency preparedness during epidemics and pandemics and \n34. \nhealth workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. The additional financing will benefit directly the \n20% of the population that are at high risk of death from COVID-19 infection, and about 13,500 \nhealth  workers  will  also  benefit  directly,  especially  those  with  professions  that  put  them  at \noccupational risk due to COVID-19 pandemic. The additional financing will provide gender and \nculturally  sensitive  information,  education  and  awareness  raising,  and  communication  on  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. \n \nGender.  The  original  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  most \n35. \nactivities under the gender action plan are at the final stages of successful completion. Activities \ninclude sex-disaggregated data collection, gender-sensitive public outreach, targets for women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  training  events,  and  career  development  of    female  health  workers.  Women \nconstitute  82%  of  the  health  care  workforce.  Women  are  commonly  responsible  for  blood \nprocessing, IPC, waste management and handling, cleaning, and disinfection; and are the most \nexposed  to  hospital-acquired  infections  and  transfusion-transmitted  infections.  Women  also \nconstitute  about  80%  of  hospital  patients.  To  ensure  that  women  continue  to  access  medical \nservices  during  the  pandemic,  the  MOH  is  reviewing  medical  protocols  periodically  based  on \nWHO advice. As such, medical services directly responding to women\u2019s needs (e.g., obstetrics) \nremain in full operation. Under the additional financing, women health frontline workers (doctors \nand nurses) will be trained on the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-\n19 and SARI. This will ensure that patients receive adequate treatment and that health frontline \nworkers are fully cognizant of personal safety protocols. \n \nE. \n \n36. \nEnvironment.  The  additional  financing  is  categorized  C  for  environment.  Although  the \nproposed activities under the additional financing will not have any direct environmental impacts, \nsome  impacts  relating to  the  construction  of the  warehouse facility  are  likely,  but  these  will  be \nminimal and will be within the boundaries of an existing health facility in Ulaanbaatar. The likely \nimpacts of this construction will be addressed through developing an environmental management \nplan (EMP) to address localized adverse impacts and risks during the construction phase. The \n\nSafeguards \n\n\fEMP of the current project will also updated for any risks related to unsafe collection, storage, \ntreatment, and disposal of medical and chemical liquid waste generated by health facilities. \n \n37. \nThe EMP contained in the PAM will be updated based on the final design of the proposed \nwarehouse facility and will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to awarding the civil \nworks  contract.  Contractors  (during  construction)  and  facility  operators  and  the  MOH  (during \noperation) will implement these measures. The Government of Mongolia, through the MOH, is \ncommitted to managing identified environmental risks and has agreed on a comprehensive set of \nloan covenants. The additional financing project will have significant environmental, health, and \nsafety benefits. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary  resettlement and  indigenous  peoples.  Similar to  the  current  project,  the \nadditional  financing  will  not  trigger  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguard \nrequirements and is classified category C for both social safeguard areas. Project activities will \nnot involve land acquisition, and any civil works will likely be confined to project facilities\u2019 existing \nlands or government-owned lands. The proposed site for the new warehouse facility is known to \nbe government-owned land. If any resettlement impacts are unavoidable for any project activities, \nthe borrower shall inform ADB, prepare a resettlement plan for such activities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  carry  out  any  such  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  approved \nresettlement  plan. All  ethnic  groups will  have  equal  opportunities  to  avail  themselves  of  and \naccess  benefits  from  the  project,  if  they  require  health  and  medical  attention. The  project  will \nimplement  effective  ways  to  design  and  deliver  information,  education,  and  communication \nactivities \neffective \ncommunication. Dissemination of COVID-19 messages within communities will be conducted in \nboth the Mongolian language and local languages. \n \nF. \n \n39.
