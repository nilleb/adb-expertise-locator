It will enhance \ninclusive economic growth and regional connectivity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic location. Georgia is located at the center of transit routes linking Europe and \nAsia.  Trade  with  neighboring  countries\u2014Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  the  Russian  Federation,  and \nTurkey\u2014is important to Georgia's economy. In 2015, the total transit trade of 11.0 million tons \nwas similar to the total of exports (2.0 million tons) and imports (8.9 million tons). Georgia\u2019s main \ntrade partners include Turkey (trade turnover of $1,629 million), the Russian Federation ($1,190 \nmillion),  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  ($966  million).2  International  tourism  is  one  of \nGeorgia\u2019s  fastest-growing  economic  and  export  sectors,  and  accounted  for  about  7%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2017. \n \n4. \nRegional connectivity. The Government of Georgia is making substantial investments in \ninfrastructure  intended  to  take  advantage  of  its  location  and  tourism  attractions,  and  is \nemphasizing the country\u2019s transit trade through development of the East\u2013West and North\u2013South \ntransport  corridors. The East\u2013West  Highway  is  part  of  Corridor  2  of the Central  Asia Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program,  and  connects  to  the  North\u2013South  Corridor  at \nMtskheta, directly north of Tbilisi. The East\u2013West Highway is being upgraded with the assistance \nof  ADB, the  European Investment  Bank, the  Japan International  Cooperation  Agency,  and the \nWorld Bank. The North\u2013South Corridor connects the Russian border (Kazbegi) to the Armenian \nborder  (Sadakhlo)  and  the  Azerbaijani  border  (Red  Bridge).  It  is  a  lifeline  for  Georgian  and \nArmenian economic activities, and provides the only land access to the Russian Federation. \n \n5. \nRoad  sector  policy  context.  The  national  development  strategy  aims  to  transform \nGeorgia into a regional transport and logistics hub.3 The government\u2019s transport investments have \nfocused on the road sector, with rail and port sector investments financed largely by the private \nsector.  The  Ministry  of  Regional  Development  and  Infrastructure  (MRDI)  developed  an  Action \nPlan  for  2018\u20132021  that  budgeted  GEL10,231  million  for  infrastructure development,  of  which \nabout  GEL7,324  million  was  allocated  for  improvement  of  roads  (72%).4  The  government  has \ntargeted  its  financing  and  priority  interventions  on  the  East\u2013West  Highway,  the  North\u2013South \nCorridor, and critical sections of the secondary road network.5 \n\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank provided transaction technical assistance for the project: ADB.

Tbilisi. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nGeorgia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and has high exposure to natural \n6. \nhazards.6 In particular, mountainous areas face adverse and worsening conditions as a result of \nclimate change, with increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, avalanches, landslides, \nand mudflows.7 Accordingly, the government has prioritized and committed to reducing the risks \nof climate change through investment in climate-resilient infrastructure, including roads, bridges, \nand tunnels, and developing early-warning systems (footnotes 3 and 7). \n \n7. \nSector  performance. The road network totals  about  22,000 km,  including  about  1,520 \nkm of international roads and 5,370 km of secondary roads managed by the Roads Department \nunder  the  MRDI,  as  well  as  15,000  km  of  local  roads  managed  by  municipal  administrations. \nWhile  most  (85%)  of  the  international  roads  are  in  good  or  fair  condition,  about  40%  of  the \nsecondary roads and 60% of the local roads are in poor condition. Travelling through and within \nGeorgia can be time consuming, uncomfortable, and expensive, and disproportionately affects \nwomen\u2019s access to jobs, markets, and public services. \n \n8. \nRoad  maintenance  expenditure\u2014including  rehabilitation,  and  periodic  and  routine \nmaintenance\u2014totaled about $149 million equivalent in 2018, which compares favorably with other \ncountries  in  the  region.8  The  government  has  made  continued  efforts  to  improve  road \nmaintenance  planning,  budgeting,  and  efficiency  through  the  development  of  a  road  asset \nmanagement system, the piloting of performance-based maintenance (PBM) contracts, and the \nassessment  of  tolling  options.  The  road  asset  management  system  informs  a  5-year  rolling \nplanning  and  programming  process.  The  Roads  Department  contracts  all  construction  and \nmaintenance activities to the private sector through open competitive bidding. One PBM contract \nis under implementation (Kakheti region) and two other PBM contracts are being prepared under \nADB and World Bank financing. The government recently sought assistance from development \npartners to implement e-tolling on priority highway sections, including the project road (para. 39). \n \n9. \nThe  road  safety  situation  is  improving,  with  some  promising  recent  developments.  The \nroad traffic fatality rate declined from 16.8 fatalities per 100,000 people in 2010 to 15.3 fatalities \nper 100,000 people in 2016, but road safety remains a concern, and compares unfavorably with \nEuropean  Union  countries  (2016  road  traffic  fatality  rates  were  5.5  in  France  and  4.1  in \nGermany).9 In 2015, the government enacted the revised Law on Road Traffic that included road \nsafety-related amendments. The government approved a National Road Safety Strategy in 2016, \nand  an  interagency  Road  Safety  Commission  was  subsequently  established.  Road  safety \ninvestment  planning  and  performance-tracking  systems  are  being  developed  following  the \nInternational  Road  Assessment  Program\u2019s  approaches  and  methodologies.  Systematic  road \nsafety audits and public-awareness campaigns are needed to support the government\u2019s efforts to \nreduce road traffic injuries and fatalities. \n \n10. \nNorth\u2013South Corridor. The North\u2013South Corridor connects Tbilisi (1,159,000 people) to \nthe Mtskheta\u2013Mtianeti region (95,000 people) in the north and to the Kvemo Kartli region (424,000 \npeople) in the south. It serves as the main transport artery for the Mtskheta\u2013Mtianeti region, and \nspans quite diverse and spectacular terrain, from the historic capital of Georgia (Mtskheta) north \nto  Stepantsminda  in  the  Greater  Caucasus  mountains.  The  region  is  home  to  many  tourist \nattractions,  including  cultural  heritage  sites,  ski  resorts,  natural  parks,  and  monuments.

Global Status Report on Road Safety. Geneva. \n \n\nTbilisi. \n\n \n\n\fdisruption,  adverse  climate  conditions,  safety  hazards,  and  slow  travel  times  are  major \nimpediments to meeting increasing transport demand and harnessing the tourism potential of the \nregion. The government has developed a tourism strategy for the region that identified, through a \nvalue  chain  analysis,  a  number  of  opportunities  and  priority  interventions  for  the  Gudauri  and \nKhada valleys.10 Lack of tourist information centers, inadequate guest house services, and limited \nguide training were identified among the possible areas for improvements. \n \n11. \nPrefeasibility and feasibility studies were prepared, under World Bank financing, for the \nmost problematic portion of the North\u2013South Corridor, which extends from Jinvali to the Russian \nborder  (about  100  km).  The  studies  concluded  that  the  central  section  connecting  Kvesheti to \nKobi (34 km) through the Jvari Pass (2,379 meters above sea level) was a key bottleneck and \nneeded  a  bypass  road  through  the  Khada  Valley  (para.  30).  The  existing  Kvesheti\u2013Kobi  road \nsection experiences heavy traffic and is unsafe as a result of an alignment that is inadequate for \nthe challenging geographical and climatic conditions, particularly in winter. Avalanche, landslide, \nand snow load risks are significant, and these cause frequent and extended road closures. The \nexisting highway provides a low standard alignment, which is characterized by substandard open \ntunnels and avalanche galleries, where modern trucks cannot pass simultaneously. \n \n12. \nRecognizing these challenges, the government has requested the assistance of ADB and \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to progressively improve the \nNorth\u2013South  Corridor  by  (i)  constructing  a  climate-resilient  two-lane  bypass  road  between \nKvesheti and Kobi; (ii)  providing  adequate  safety features  and improving geometric  alignment; \nand  (iii)  providing  well-designed  tunnels  that  will  enable  safe,  year-round  two-way  traffic.  The \nproject will also help realize the tourism potential of Kazbegi and the Mtskheta\u2013Mtianeti region by \nestablishing a multipurpose visitor center in the Khada Valley. It will help enhance the experience \nand length of stay of visitors to the region, and provide training and business opportunities for \nlocal communities. \n \n13. \nStrategic fit. The project  is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy  2030,  and  supports four  of  its \nseven operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (para. 44); \n(ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (para.  45);  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (paras. 11\u201312); and \n(iv)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (para.  4).11  Improving  the  project  road  is  a \ngovernment  priority,  as  reflected  by  its  inclusion  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for \nGeorgia,  2019\u20132021.12  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  forthcoming  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Georgia,  2019\u20132023,  which  aims  to  develop  economic  corridors  for  private  sector \ndevelopment to create more jobs, combat poverty, and facilitate interregional trade. \n \n14. \nLessons.  Since  2009,  ADB  has  financed  several  preparatory  studies  and  four  road \nprojects,  including  three  stand-alone  projects  and  one  multitranche  financing  facility,  totaling \nnearly  $1  billion.13  The  country  partnership  strategy  final  review  (2014\u20132018)  rated  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n10 World Bank. 2014.

This  assessment  was  subsequently \nvalidated  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department,  which  also  recommended  to  further \nfocus on regional cooperation and integration as key driver of change.14 Lessons from completed \nand  ongoing  projects  include  the  need  to  (i)  increase  communication  and  engagement  with \naffected people and other project stakeholders, (ii) improve the implementation-readiness of land \nacquisition and resettlement plans, and (iii) enhance the Roads Department\u2019s project and contract \nmanagement capacity. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the proposed \nproject in synergy with other ADB-assisted interventions. Continuous support and dialogue with \nthe  government  and  development  partners  active  in  the  sector  will  help  ensure  sound  project \noperation and management upon its completion. \n \n15. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  is  supporting  the  government  in  developing  a \nroad maintenance strategy, while EBRD has supported the government in preparing a national \nelectronic  toll  collection  strategy.15  Through  the  project,  ADB  will  help  the  government  in:  (i) \nensuring that adequate climate change adaptation, gender-sensitive, and road safety features are \nincorporated  into  the  engineering  design;  (ii)  implementing  a  biodiversity  action  plan  and  a \nstakeholder  engagement  plan  to  mitigate  key  project  risks;  and  (iii)  expanding  the  regional \nspillover  and  economic  benefits  supported  by  other  ADB-assisted  projects  in  Georgia  and \nArmenia.  Further,  ADB\u2019s  leading  role  in the  CAREC  program  will  provide  the government  with \ntools  and  opportunities  for  information  sharing  and  learning  on  road  safety  and  asset \nmanagement. \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  economic  growth  and  regional \n16. \nconnectivity enhanced (footnote 3); and (ii) trade, tourism, and economic corridors improved.16 \nThe project will have the following outcome: connectivity, safety, and livelihoods along the North\u2013\nSouth Corridor improved.17 \n \nC. \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Project  roads  constructed,  and  road  safety  awareness  increased.  This \noutput will include the construction of (i) about 23 km of climate-resilient bypass road between \nKvesheti and Kobi, and (ii) about 5 km of climate-resilient all-weather access roads to roadside \ntowns and villages. The project roads will include safety facilities fitted for the elderly, children, \nwomen, and differently abled. This output will also include the development and implementation \nof a gender-sensitive road safety awareness campaign for roadside villages and schools. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  Khada  Valley  visitor  center  established.

ADB  will  be  the  sole  financier  for  the  construction  of  the  road  section  (CP-02).  All \ncontracts will be procured in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). Universal procurement will only apply to the single cofinanced CP-01R contract. A project \nimplementation agreement will be signed between ADB and EBRD that sets out the terms and \nconditions under which cofinancing of the tunnel section (CP-01R) construction will take place. \n \n28. \nADB  and  EBRD  agreed  that  each  of  their  respective  policies  and  procedures  will  be \nfollowed  in  (i)  case  of  disbursement  arrangements  and  establishment  of  accounts  used  for \npayments from their respective loans, as may be applicable; (ii) the reporting mechanisms and \nauditing of project accounts relating to their respective loans; and (iii) the measures against fraud, \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \n \nADB  and  EBRD  agreed  to  adopt  a  unified  social  and  environmental  assessment  and \n29. \nplanning  process,  as  well  as  unified  safeguard  documentation,  consultation,  and  disclosure \nrequirements to satisfy both ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and EBRD\u2019s safeguards \nrequirements  as  stipulated  in  EBRD\u2019s  Environmental  and  Social  Policy.22  During  project \nimplementation, ADB and EBRD will jointly supervise and monitor the environmental and social \naspects  of  the  tunnel  section  (CP-01R),  while  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring the environmental and social aspects of the road section (CP-02). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \nAlignment alternatives. The engineering studies commenced with a prefeasibility study \n30. \nthat assessed several alignments in three alternative corridors: two within the Gudauri Valley and \none within the Khada Valley. An upgrade of the existing road alignment with improved geometry \nand avalanche galleries was considered, but deemed inadequate as it would not address the core \nroad functionality and safety problems as well as climate-related risks.23 The two corridors in the \nGudauri Valley were not considered feasible mainly due to adverse geological conditions resulting \nin high risks for tunnel construction and safety, and possible significant impacts on the Kazbegi \nNational  Park  (about  6km  of  the  new  highway  would  have  run  through  the  Park).  Geological \nconditions  in the  Khada  Valley  were  considered  acceptable,  and thus  it  was  deemed  the  only \nfeasible corridor for the project. During the feasibility study, the Khada Valley corridor was refined \nto three possible alignments. A comprehensive multicriteria analysis concluded that the proposed \nroad alignment requires a 9 km long tunnel through the mountain range between Tskere and Kobi.  \n \n31. \nRoad design. Reflecting the difficult terrain, the road design provides for five tunnels, the \nlongest of which is about 9 km, and six bridges, the largest of which is a 425-meter (m) span arch \nstructure about 165 m above river level. The road cross section will have two traffic lanes (each \n3.5 m wide, with 2.5 m surfaced shoulders). Climbing and passing lanes will also be provided for \n\n                                                \n22 EBRD. 2014. Environmental and Social Policy. London. \n23 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nabout 70% of the road length. This cross section will be adequate for the traffic of about 14,000 \nvehicles per day that is projected to use the road up to the end of the economic evaluation period \nin 2048. Of this traffic, about 69% will be passenger vehicles and about 17% heavy and medium \ngoods vehicles. The remaining traffic will be buses and smaller commercial vehicles. \n \n32. \nRoad pavements will be flexible with asphaltic concrete surfacing. The road and bridge \ndesigns have been prepared in accordance with appropriate international design standards and \ntake into account the extreme climatic conditions that exist in the project area. The road design \nalso reflects consultations with communities living adjacent to the road, which have resulted in \nthe inclusion in the project road\u2019s design of several village access roads, and crossing places for \npeople and livestock, with appropriate warning devices. \n \nRoad safety. The road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in \n33. \nterms of road safety, and the design review team included an international road safety specialist. \nThe tunnels are designed to reflect the provisions of the European Union Directive 2004/54/EC \non minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network. The design \nwill be subjected to detailed road safety audits during construction, and prior to final acceptance \nof  the  completed  road.  The  road  safety  audits  will  be  conducted,  before  construction,  during \nconstruction,  and  prior  to  completion,  in  close  coordination  with  the  traffic  police  and  relevant \ngovernment agencies. \n \n34. \nClimate change. The primary climate change adaptation under the project is the overall \nroad realignment and tunneling. In addition, a detailed climate risk assessment was conducted \nfor the project road for the period to 2050 to ensure that the design specifications are adequate \nfor future climatic conditions (footnote 20). The frequency and magnitude of avalanches, floods, \nand landslides are likely to increase, and about 10% of the project road drainage systems were \nfound to have potentially insufficient capacity under future extreme precipitation events. These \ndrainages  structures  will  be  reviewed  by  the  PMCSC  during  project  implementation  and  their \ndimensions will be increased as appropriate. \n \n35. \nThe technical due diligence confirmed that the project road\u2019s technical design, alignment, \ncross-section,  bridges,  tunnels,  drainage  structures,  pavements,  and  climate  and  road  safety \nprovisions are appropriate for a road of this standard in this location, and for the volume of traffic \nthat is projected to use it. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability.  The economic  evaluation  of the  project  was undertaken  using the \n36. \nhighway  development  and  management  model,  and \nin  accordance  with  relevant  ADB \nguidelines.24 For the economic analysis, the with-project scenario assumed the improvement of \nthe  23  km  road  section  from  Kvesheti  to  Kobi.  Without  the  project,  the  road  is  expected  to \ndeteriorate to an average international roughness index value of 8.5 within 5 years, rendering it \nin  poor  condition.  Future  traffic  was  estimated  based  on  classified  traffic  counts  conducted  in \n2017, and available GDP growth forecasts. \n \n37. \nThe project is economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n13.2%, with a net present value of $190 million at a 9% discount rate. The principal quantifiable \nbenefits are reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced travel time. Sensitivity tests confirmed \nthat the economic viability of the project is robust against project cost increases of up to 164% \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n24 ADB. 2017.

The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return remains at \n11.9% even with the exclusion of generated traffic, diverted traffic, and road safety benefits. \n \n38. \nFinancial sustainability. The project is nonrevenue generating. The project road will be \nmaintained under the government\u2019s maintenance program. An assessment of  the MRDI\u2019s road \nasset management practices and capabilities was carried out during project preparation. Steady \nincreases in road sector funding since 2004 led to major backlog recovery. During 2014\u20132018, \n(i) annual  expenditure  for  road  maintenance  nearly  doubled,  from  GEL218  million  to  GEL407 \nmillion; (ii) the compounded growth rate for annual road maintenance expenditure was 13.3%, \nwith an average annual inflation rate of 3.6%; and (iii) the compounded annual growth of road-\nrelated  revenues  was  15.1%,  or  1.2%\u20132.1%  of  GDP.  The  annual  average  incremental \nmaintenance  costs  associated  with  the  project  are  estimated  to  be  in  line  with  the  current \nexpenditure ($25,000 per km). \n \n39. \nThe government recognizes the need to further expand its revenue base to cater for future \nneeds,  and  has  sought  assistance  from  development  partners  to  assess  the  potential  and \nsuitability  of  road  tolling.  Two  studies  supported  by  the World  Bank  and EBRD  recommended \ntolling  as  viable  revenue  source.25  The  government  is  recruiting  consultants  to  (i)  conduct  a \nfeasibility  of  seven  pre-identified  priority  highway  sections,  including  the  project  road;  and  (ii) \nprepare technical, financial, and bidding documentation for the three most viable tolling projects. \nThe  financial  analysis  concluded  that  the  MRDI  has  sufficient  financial  capacity,  within  the \ngovernment\u2019s budgetary procedures, to meet recurrent expenditures to adequately operate and \nmaintain the project road. \n \nC. \n \n40. \nFinancial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was undertaken \nin  accordance  with  relevant  ADB  guidelines.26  The  FMA  considered  the  Roads  Department\u2019s \ncapacity  with  regard  to  fund-flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting \nsystems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  The \nFMA  concluded  that  the  financial  management  risk\u2014both  inherent  risk  and  control  risk\u2014is \nmoderate mainly because of (i) the growing portfolio of externally funded projects that may lead \nto insufficient staffing within ETCIC and (ii) lack of variance analysis between budgeted and actual \nexpenditure that may lead to inadequate financial reporting. The FMA further concluded that, if \nthese  issues  are  addressed,  the  ETCIC  has  sufficient  and  appropriate  financial  management \ncapacity to implement the project. The MRDI, the Roads Department, and ETCIC will maintain \nadequate  and  separate  project  records  and  accounts,  which  will  be  audited  annually  by  an \nindependent auditor. \n \n41. \nProcurement.  A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  (PPRA)  was  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  relevant  ADB  guidelines.27  The  PPRA  considered  the  Roads  Department\u2019s \ncapacity  with  regard  to  organization  and  staffing,  information  management,  procurement \npractices,  complaints  and  dispute  resolution  mechanisms,  and  accountability  measures.  The \nPPRA  concluded  that the procurement  risk  is  moderate  because of  (i)  the  growing  portfolio of \nexternally funded projects that may lead to insufficient staffing within the Roads Department and \n(ii)  record  management  systems  and  procedures  that  need  further  improvement.  The  PPRA \nconcluded  that,  if  these  issues  are  addressed,  the  Roads  Department  has  sufficient  and \n                                                \n25 Global Infrastructure Facility. 2017.

The project\u2019s procurement readiness \nis  high,  given  that  the  three  main  contracts  are  being  procured  through  advance  contracting \n(footnote  21).  The  government  has  been  advised  that  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing do not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n42. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  MRDI  and  the  Roads  Department  have  an  adequate \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management policy and procedures as a result \nof  the  sizable  portfolio  of  ADB-assisted  transport  operations.  Some  shortcomings  on  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  particularly  in  relation  to  grievance  management,  have  been \nidentified in the ongoing Batumi Bypass Road Project (footnote 13). These weaknesses are being \naddressed  through  regional  technical  assistance,  which  includes  on-the-job  training  of  Roads \nDepartment  staff  and  implementation  of  grievance  management  tools.28  One  experienced \nconsultant has been assigned to work with the Roads Department on a continuous basis to help \nimprove compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguards requirements. \n \n43. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MRDI, and the Roads Department. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD. \n \n44. \nSocioeconomic  surveys  and  gender  assessment  were  carried  out  during  project \npreparation,  and  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  prepared.  Average \nmonthly income in the project area is substantially lower than  the national average of GEL955 \nbecause  of  insufficient  productive  assets,  seasonal  jobs,  and  limited  business  and  training \nopportunities.29 Towns and villages in the project area are increasingly benefitting from a booming \ntourism sector. The project will benefit about 86,000 people located along the project road and \nthe  North\u2013South  Corridor  by  improving  access  to  jobs,  markets,  and  public  services  while \nreducing road traffic fatalities and injuries.  Further,  the  Khada  Valley  visitor  center  will  support \ntourism-related jobs and training, and will provide livelihood improvement opportunities for project-\naffected people and local communities. \n \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will address the \n45. \ngender issues identified during project preparation, which included enhancing connectivity of the \nvillages through all-weather access roads, increasing road safety features and awareness, and \nsupporting tourism-related job and training opportunities. A gender action plan was prepared in \nconsultation with project beneficiaries and government officials. 30 The gender action plan includes \nactivities  supporting  (i)  gender-responsive  and  socially  inclusive  design  features  across  all \ninfrastructure built under the project, (ii) affirmative measures to enhance women\u2019s access to job \nand training opportunities in both the Roads Department and the Khada Valley visitor center, and \n(iii)  sex-disaggregated  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project\u2019s  progress  and  achievements.  The \nPMCSC team includes a social development specialist who will assist the Roads Department in \nimplementing  and  monitoring  the  gender  action  plan.  The  Roads  Department  will  further  take \nnecessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in the design and \nimplementation of project activities following the principles of gender equality. \n \n\n                                                \n28 ADB. 2018.

These documents will be further updated throughout project implementation. \n \n47. \nGrievance  redress,  monitoring,  and  reporting  procedures  have  been  agreed  with  the \nRoads Department and specified in all safeguard documents. During project implementation, all \nsafeguards documents will be updated as necessary, reviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. \nThe  project  includes  adequate  resources  to  implement  and  monitor  environmental  and  social \nmitigation measures. The MRDI and Roads Department are experienced in implementing large \nand  complex  road  projects  with  significant  social  and  environmental  impacts.  Support  with \ngrievance management will be provided during project implementation. The Roads Department \nwill be assisted by the PMCSC and resettlement, biodiversity, and cultural heritage consultants \nto  ensure  compliance  with  the  project\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  prepare  semiannual \nsafeguards monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The Roads Department will also \nengage  qualified  and  experienced  external  monitors  to  verify  environmental  and  resettlement \nimpacts. \n \nEnvironment  (category  A).  The  Roads  Department  has  prepared  an  environmental \n48. \nimpact assessment and an environmental management plan (EMP) that were disclosed on the \nADB and Roads Department websites on 1 April 2019 (footnote 23). The full environment and \nsocial impact assessment package in line with EBRD requirements was disclosed on 3 May 2019. \nThe  main  anticipated  site-specific  impacts  during  construction  include  air  and  surface  water \npollution, noise and vibration, soil erosion, soil material disposal, loss or degradation of natural \nhabitat, occupational health and safety, relocation of utilities, and traffic disruption. The relative \nshort-term nature of these impacts means that in general impacts will not be significant if the EMP \nand  the  biodiversity  action  plan  are  duly  implemented.  During  operation,  the  main  anticipated \nresidual  impacts  include  those  to  residents  and  notable  specifies,  from  noise  disturbance  and \ninduced  development,  as  well  as  the  overall  impact  to  the  landscape  character  of  the  Khada \nValley. However, adequate mitigation has been included in the project design and EMP to ensure \nthat  residual  impacts  have  been  reduced  to  an  acceptable  level.  These  measures  will  be \nimplemented through the two civil works contracts and monitored through the PMCSC\u2019s contract. \n \n49. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The Roads Department has prepared two land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for the tunnel section (CP-01R; also referred to as \nLot 1) and the road section (CP-02; also referred to as Lot 2). The LARP for Lot 1 was disclosed \non the ADB and Roads Department websites in April 2019, while the LARP for Lot 2 was disclosed \nin  May  2019.33  The  census  carried  out  during  project  preparation  identified  approximately  158 \nhouseholds (616 people) that will be directly affected by land acquisition for the project. There will \nbe about 108 severely affected households (441 people), which are either physically displaced \n(11 households) or will lose 10% or more of their productive assets. A total of 30 households have \nbeen classified vulnerable. All affected people will receive adequate compensation in accordance \n\n                                                \n31 ADB.

An independent and sample-based valuation of land \nplots  is  being  carried  out  before  LARP  implementation  to  confirm  the  adequacy  of  the  land \nvaluation. Additional due diligence will be conducted for the access roads and the visitor center, \nand the LARP for Lot 2 will be updated as appropriate. \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the project area\n\n50.\nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.\n\nF.\n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan\n\n51.\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in\ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.34  The  project  risks  are  considered\nmanageable through the prescribed mitigation measures.\n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nDeterioration of bilateral \nrelationships with neighboring \ncountries and border crossing \nperformance at Larsi border \ncrossing point may adversely \naffect cargo volumes \n\nExceptional conditions \nencountered during tunnel \nboring machine excavation \nmay delay construction \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nCargo accounts for about 15% of traffic on the project road; thus the project\u2019s \neconomic viability will not be affected by a deterioration of performance at Larsi \nborder crossing point. The Customs Department will explore information and \ncommunication technology options to improve e-queuing and minimize \nnorthbound traffic bottlenecks. A new Transports Internationaux Routiers \n(International Road Transports) park for heavy goods vehicles was built in 2018 in \nKazbegi to improve safety and minimize air pollution on the North\u2013South Corridor. \nA risk register was prepared by the project design consultant and reviewed by an \nindependent tunnel expert. The main construction risks include high water inflow, \ntemperature, and rock abrasiveness; and tunnel boring machine entrapment. \nRisk-sharing mechanisms and payment provisions were introduced for these risks \nin the bidding and contractual documentation. \n\nIV.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  government,  MRDI,  and \n\n52.\nthat\nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those\nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and\ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM  and loan documents.
