Selection  criteria  have  been  set  to \nensure  that  future  subprojects  comply  with  the  project  environmental \nclassification.  An  environmental  assessment  review  procedure,  which \nhas  been  prepared,  will  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of  the \nsubprojects. \n \nThe Project is sector-based in design. It will finance part of the medium-\nterm  road  network  development  program.  At  the  end  of  the  Project, \n(i) about 232 kilometers (km) of national roads will have been improved \nto  maintainable  condition;  (ii) a  road  maintenance  program  (RMP)  will \nhave  been  established;  (iii) access  roads  and  parking  areas  of  cross-\nborder  facilities  will  have  been  built  at  Mota  Ain,  Salele,  Sakato,  and \nOesilo;  (iv) national  contractors  will  have  gained  improved  capacity  to \nimplement  roadworks;  (v) the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI)  will  have \nimproved  its  ability  to  administer  road  projects  and  the  RMP;  (vi) road \nsafety  awareness  in  the  project  areas  will  have  increased;  and \n(vii) climate-proofing measures will have become a regular part of road \ndesign and construction. \n \nThe  selection  of  subproject  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  will  be  guided  by \nthe medium-term road network development program and based on the \nselection criteria and procedure agreed on by the Government and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe RMP will first be established under the Project in three pilot districts \nin  the  border  region\u2014Bobonaro,  Covalima,  and  Oecussi.  Midway \nthrough  project  implementation,  MOI  will  prepare  a  strategy  for \nexpanding the RMP to cover the entire road network. \n \nA medium-term strategic planning exercise is under way to set the key \npriorities  for  the  country\u2019s  development  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth.  Infrastructure  development  is  among  the  three  predefined \nmedium-term  strategic  objectives  (the  other  two  are  poverty  reduction \nand  private  sector  development),  and  roads  and  water  supply \ninfrastructure are a top priority for 2010. The Government has urged the \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nline  ministries  and  development  partners  to  align  their  budgets  with \nnational priorities. The development of road sector is widely recognized \nas  a  key  factor  in  creating  jobs,  promoting  private  sector  growth, \nincreasing agricultural productivity, and reducing poverty. \n \nWhile  strategic  planning  by  the  Government  is making  progress,  there \nis  a  need  for  better  coordination  with  development  partners.  Working \ngroups  with  members  from  government  agencies  and  development \npartners  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  annual \npriority  programs.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  set  up  the \nDirectorate for Aid Effectiveness for more transparent and harmonized \nexternal  aid  flows.  Budget  and  aid  information  is  circulated  at  the \nquarterly meetings of development partners, cochaired by the ministers \nof  foreign  affairs  and  finance.  MOI  also  plans  to  meet  regularly  with \ndevelopment partners to coordinate the road sector development. \n \nThe Project will support the national priorities and development vision of \nTimor-Leste by establishing sound and sustainable road network, and it \nwill  strengthen  subregional  cooperation  with  Indonesia  by  improving \nborder  post  facilities.  The  sector-based  approach  will  allow  the \nGovernment to lead in formulating and implementing its sector strategy \nand  development  partner  coordination.  MOI  and  its  road  agency,  the \nDirectorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood  Control  (DRBFC),  can  thus \nimplement  the  Project  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  road \nsector development, and more actively absorb the required knowledge \nand expertise. \n \nThe  Project  is  also  consistent  with  the  reconciliation  and  stabilization \nstrategy  adopted  by  the  United  Nations  and  the  Government  in  the \naftermath  of  the  conflict  of  2006.  With  its  comparative  advantage  in \ninfrastructure development, ADB has been asked by the Government to \nfacilitate  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  by  addressing \nphysical infrastructure constraints, particularly in the road sector.  \n \nThe Project will support road sector development, leading to economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  areas.  It  is  expected  to \nmake socioeconomic facilities in the project areas more accessible and \ncross-border activities more efficient, reduce travel time and costs, and \nimprove planning and project implementation in the road sector. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $52.90 million.  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n46.00 \n6.90 \n52.90 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n86.96 \n13.04 \n100.00 \n\n\fGrant Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization  1 December 2009 to 31 May 2015 \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n30 November 2014 \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services  A  consulting \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe Government has requested a grant of $46 million from ADB to help \nfinance the Project. The Asian Development Fund grant will finance all \nforeign  exchange  cost,  local  cost  for  consulting  services,  equipment, \nproject  management,  95%  of  cost  of  civil  works  for  access  roads  and \nparking  areas  of  border  posts,  90%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for  the \nrehabilitation of about 232 km of national roads, and 70% of the cost of \ncivil works for road maintenance. Counterpart funds of $6.9 million from \nthe Government will cover 5% of the cost of civil works for access roads \nand  parking  areas  of  border  posts,  10%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for \nroad rehabilitation, 30% of the cost of civil works for road maintenance, \nand any taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, and \nright-of-way costs. \n \n\n \nMOI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  project \nmanagement.  In  view  of  its  still-limited  capacity,  MOI  will  operate \nthrough  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  created  for  previous \nADB-funded road projects in the country. The PMU will take charge of \nday-to-day  project  management  and  provide  on-the-job  training  to \ncounterpart DRBFC staff. \n \nMinistry of Infrastructure \n \nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  contracts  over \n$1 million  for  civil  works  and  $0.5 million  for  goods  will  undergo \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts below those amounts \nwill go through national competitive bidding (NCB) or, as appropriate for \nworks contracts up to $100,000, through shopping. \n \n\nthe  Project \n\nfirm  will  be  hired  under \n\nto  provide \n497 person-months  of  consulting  services  (141 \ninternational  and \n356 national)  for  (i) subproject  appraisal,  (ii) detailed  design,  (iii) bid \ndocument  preparation,  (iv) bidding  and  bid  evaluation  assistance, \n(v) construction  supervision,  and  (vi) project  performance  monitoring. \nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Financial  audit  consultants  will \nbe hired through least-cost selection. \n \nThe Project will also finance the cost of project management. PMU staff \nwill  be  hired  individually  through  competitive  recruitment.  As  well-\nqualified  national  consultants  are  difficult  to  find  in  Timor-Leste,  the \ncontracts  of \nthe  road \nmaintenance  engineer  (national)  of  the  PMU  for  the  Road  Sector \nImprovement Project will be extended. \n \n\nfinancial  administrator  (national)  and \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nthe  World  Food  Programme \n\nImproving  access  to  markets  can  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by \nincreasing  farming  inputs.  According  to  the  June  2007  crop  and  food \nsupply  assessment  mission  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization \nand \nto  Timor-Leste,  38%\u201354%  of \nhouseholds suffer food shortages 3\u20135 months per year in most districts. \nThe road improvements will lead to increased marketing, and increased \nhousehold income. With improved access to local and regional markets \nand towns, farmers will be able to expand and diversify their agricultural \nproduction.  People  can  get  better  prices  for  their  products  when  they \nsell  at  larger  markets  or  directly  to  factories  rather  than  through \nmiddlemen.  \n \nBetter access to health facilities will improve the health of the people\u2014\nin  particular  women  and  children.  The  people  of  Timor-Leste  are \nvulnerable  to  respiratory  diseases,  diarrheal  malaria,  dengue  fever, \ntuberculosis, leprosy, and other treatable diseases. Improved access to \nhealth-care facilities will encourage people to seek medical assistance. \nBetter  roads  will  also  ease  travel  to  schools,  and  help  strengthen  the \nschool  system  by  reducing  teacher  absentee  rates  and  enabling \nschools to attract more qualified teachers. \n \nIn  Timor-Leste,  sociocultural  factors  contribute  to  low  enrollment  and \nhigh  dropout  rates  among  female  students,  high  illiteracy  among  adult \nfemales, high female unemployment, sex segregation in the paid labor \nforce,  an  emerging  gender  gap  in  wages,  high  maternal  mortality,  and \ndomestic  violence.  About  28%  of  women  suffer  from  malnutrition;  of \nthese, 7% are in need of treatment. The gender-specific benefits of the \nProject  are  (i) improved  access  to  health-care  facilities;  (ii) improved \naccess  to  schools,  social  services,  and  other  key  facilities;  and \n(iii) targeted  employment  opportunities  for  female  laborers,  such  as \nbioengineering. \n \nThe Project makes several assumptions and is subject to various risks, \nas follows: \n \nResurgence  of  conflict.  High  unemployment  and  high  poverty \nincidence  are  heightening  the  potential  for  instability.  The  Government \nis  pursuing  a  significant  reform  agenda  and  has  made  progress  in \naddressing \nthe  2006  unrest. \nDisplaced  people  have  returned,  and  the  Government  has  introduced \nreforms in the security sector, addressed claims of discrimination raised \nby  former  soldiers,  and  made  social  transfer  payments  to  vulnerable \ngroups. The police force is gradually resuming responsibility for law and \norder,  while  UN  police  and  international  forces  continue  to  bolster \nsecurity. \n \nLimited  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure.  MOI  has  both \nhuman  resource  and  budget  constraints.  The  budget  allocation  for  the \nroad sector in 2009 is only about $11 million, making the 6,000 km road \nnetwork severely underinvested. As the road agency, DRBFC has only \n12  engineers.  The  PMU  under  MOI  will  therefore  be  maintained  and \n\nthe  causes  and  consequences  of \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nstrengthened  to  oversee  and  administer  day-to-day  matters.  ADB  is \nalso  implementing  a  TA  to  strengthen  project  management  capacity \nand improve budget execution. \n \nLack of road maintenance financing. DRBFC used to rely on a road \nmaintenance management system developed under a JICA TA project \nfor  road  maintenance  planning,  but  there  has  always  been  a  shortage \nof  human  resources  and  funds  for  planned  road  maintenance.  The \nGovernment  has  given  its  assurance  that  it  will  gradually  increase  its \nroad maintenance funding. The Project will support the maintenance of \nnational roads in the border region. \n \nthe  border \nin  border  management.  How  well \nDeficiencies \nmanagement  agencies,  such  as  the  Joint  Border  Committee,  perform \nwill  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  benefits  of  road  improvement \nreach  across  borders  and  sustain  subregional  cooperation  and \nintegration.  A  regional  TA  project  is  being  prepared  by  ADB  to  help \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the governments of Papua New \nGuinea and Timor-Leste in cross-border matters with Indonesia. \n \nInadequate  capacity  of  national  contractors. To attract international \ncontractors,  road  rehabilitation  contracts  will  be  designed  in  larger \npackages,  and  most  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  Joint \nventures  between \ninternational  and  national  contractors  will  be \nencouraged through consultations and pre-bidding workshops. Most of \nthe contract packages for road maintenance are expected to be small, \nand NCB procedures will be used to encourage national contractors to \nparticipate.  Small  contractors  will  be  trained  in  road  maintenance \ntechnology, bidding and contracting, and project management. \n \nLack of legal authority for rights-of-way. Road sector development in \nTimor-Leste  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of  a  law  for  securing  right-of-\nway.  Although  no  land  is  expected  to  be  acquired  for  the  Project,  a \nresettlement \nland \nfor  unforeseen \nacquisition has been prepared. \n \nClimate  change.  There  are  inherent  uncertainties  in  predicting  future \nclimate change, particularly for a \u201cdata-poor\u201d country like Timor-Leste. It \nis  therefore  assumed  that  building  capacity  to  manage  current  climate \nvariability,  with  some \nforward-looking  predictions,  will  also  build \ncapacity  to  understand  and  manage  ongoing  and  longer-term  climate \nchange.  Moreover,  adaptation  options  with  other  important  benefits, \nsuch  as  erosion  control,  will  be  emphasized  as  a  way  of  reducing  the \nrisk of inappropriate investments.  \n\nresettlement  and \n\nframework \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n124  30'E\n\no\n126  30'E\n\nRoad Maintenance Program\n\nBorder Post\n\nNational Capital\n\nDistrict Capital\n\nTown\n\nPort\n\nNational Road\n\nDistrict Road\n\nRiver\n\nCandidate Project Road\n\nTIMOR-LESTE\nROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT\nSECTOR PROJECT\n\nAtauro Island\n\nS t r a i t     o f     W e t a r\n\nMaumeta-Atauro\n\nLauten\n\nLaivai\n\nBaucau\n\nMula\n\nTrisulo\n\nCom\n\nJaco\n\nJoco\nIsland\nTutuala Cape Cutcha\n8  30\u2019So\n\nLaga\n\nLuro\n\nLos Palos\n\nQuelicai\n\nBaquia\n\nLAUTEM\n\nLore\n\n8  30\u2019So\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nMaubara\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nLIQUICA\n\nTokoluli\n\nLiquisa\n\nTibar\n\nDILI\n\nLaklo\n\nLaleia\n\nVemasse\n\nBAUCAU\n\nPort Hera\nDILI\n\nMetinaro\n\nManatuto\n\nMANATUTO\n\nVenilale\n\nS a v u     S e a\n\nFatubess\n\nErmera\n\nLacluta\n\nAtabae\n\nERMERA\n\nBOBONARO\n\nLetetoho\n\nMaliana\nOeleu\n\nBobonaro\n\nAtsabe\n\nAinaro\n\nBatugade\n\nMota Ain\n\nRemexio\n\nLequidoe\n\nAILEU\n\nAileu\n\nLacluban\n\nTuriscai\n\nMaubisse\nAituto\nHato Builico\n\nSolibad\n\nAlas\n\nMANUFAHI\n\nNatarbora\n\nOssu\n\nLactula\n\nLassoralai\n\nIliomar\n\nUato Carabau\n\nVIQUEQUE\n\nUatulari\n\nViqueque\n\nBeacu\n\nPane Macassar\n\nSakalo\n\nOECUSSI\n\nCitrana\n\nTumir\n\nOe-Silo\n\n9  30\u2019So\n\nPassabe\n\nSame\nAissa\n\nAINARO\n\nHatuto\n\nBetano\n\nZumalai\n\nFatalulic\nCOVA-LIMA\nFohorem\n\nCova-lima\n\nSuai\nCape Suai\n\nSalele\n\nT i m o r     S e a\n\n9  30\u2019So\n\no\n10  00'N\n\no\n126  30'E\n\n110  00'Eo\n\nSouth China Sea\n\n130  00'Eo\n\no\n10  00'N\n\nP A C I F I C  O C E A N\n\nHALMAHERA\n\n0o\n\n0o\n\no\n10  00'S\n\nBANGKA\n\nKALIMANTAN\n\nSULAWESI\n\nSUMATRA\n\nBELITUNG\n\nBURU\n\nSERAM\n\nJ a v a     S e a\n\nJ A V A\n\nBALI\n\nFLORES\n\nKEPULAUAN ARU\n\no\n10  00'S\n\nI N D I A N     O C E A N\n\nSUMBAWA\n\nSUMBA\n\nTIMOR\n\nTIMOR-LESTE\n\n110  00'Eo\n\n130  00'Eo\n\n0\n9\n-\n2\n5\n5\n3\n \nH\nR\n\no\n124  30'E\n\nN\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nKilometers\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network Development Sector Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nTimor-Leste  comprises  the  eastern  half  of  the  island  of  Timor,  the  nearby  islands  of \nAtauro  and  Jaco,  and  Oecussi,  an  exclave  on  the  northwestern  side  of  the  island,  within \nIndonesian West Timor. The island of Timor is part of the Malay archipelago and is the largest \nand  easternmost  of  the  Lesser  Sunda  islands.  The  terrain  is  dominated  by  Mount  Ramelau, \nwhich bisects the island from east to west. The coastal zones in many parts of the country are \nnarrow, and mostly on steep hillsides.  \n \n3. \nThe  economy  grew  by  about  10%  in  2008  on  the  strength  of  a  large  increase  in \ngovernment expenditure and growth in agriculture;1 public spending, mainly with revenues from \noffshore petroleum production, continues to climb in 2009.2 Rice production increased by 21% in \n2008  following  an  expansion  in  harvested  area,  although  the  total  production  was  still  about \n60% short of annual requirements. In contrast, about 50% of the population was living below the \npoverty  line  in  2007,  up  from  about  36%  in  2001.  According  to  estimates  of  the  Food  and \nAgriculture  Organization  and  the  World  Food  Programme,  38%\u201354%  of  households  in  most \ndistricts suffer food shortages 3\u20135 months a year. About 16,000 young people join the workforce \nyearly,  but  in  the  rural  areas  many  people  are  chronically  underemployed.  Outbreaks  of  civil \nstrife are a persistent risk, as the heightened tension immediately after the serious wounding of \nthe President in February 2008 showed. \n \n4. \nRoad is the primary mode of transport, carrying 70% of freight and 90% of passengers. \nLand  transport  services  in  Timor-Leste  are  provided  competitively  by  the  private  sector,  with \nonly minimal interference from the Government, except for licensing and basic vehicle and road \nsafety requirements. Passengers are ferried by minibuses and taxies in the urban areas, and by \nminibuses and light to medium trucks licensed to carry both passengers and freight in the rural \nareas,  particularly  where  roads  are  poor.  A  small  number  of  heavy  trucks,  about  90  in  all, \ntransport containers and large equipment, but the narrow roads and difficult terrain severely limit \ntheir road coverage. \n \n5. \nTimor-Leste has an extensive road network of about 6,000 kilometers (km), half of which \nare  undeveloped  rural  tracks.  The  core  network  comprises  1,400  km  of  national  roads \nconnecting the capital, Dili, and 13 districts, and 900 km of district roads linking major population \ncenters to the national roads. About 80% (1,800 km) of core roads are (or used to be) paved. \nAlmost  the  whole  core  road  network  needs  to  be  rehabilitated  to  a  maintainable  standard,  as \nmany roads have prematurely deteriorated. The poor condition of the roads is compounded by \nfrequent landslides and road closures caused by intense rainfall and geotechnical instability in \nmountainous areas.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009. Manila. \n2   The Government spent an estimated $450 million in 2008 and expects to spend $902 million in 2009. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTimor-Leste\u2019s  expected  membership  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  in \n6. \n2012  will  significantly  boost  opportunities  for  cooperation  with  Indonesia.  The  two  countries \nagreed  on  11 June 2003  to  regulate  border  crossings  and  markets,  and  the  Government  of \nTimor-Leste, in April 2008, issued a decree law legalizing border pass activities for its citizens \nand identifying six locations where border posts were to be built.3 National roads in the border \nregion are main corridors to Indonesia, giving Timor-Leste access to cross-border activities. But, \naccording to the 2007 Timor-Leste survey of living standards, the border region and the rest of \nthe  western  and  central  districts,  which  produce  much  of  the  country\u2019s  main  commercial  crop, \ncoffee, have a poverty incidence that exceeds their share of the population.4  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nfled \n\nKey Challenges \n\n1. \n \n7. \nPost-conflict  recovery.  The  democratic  consultation  on  30  August  1999  led  to  an \noverwhelming  vote  for  independence  after  25  years  of  occupation  by  Indonesia.  In  the \ncampaign  of  destruction  that  unfortunately  followed,  however,  about  three-quarters  of  the \npeople \ntheir  homes.  United  Nations  (UN)  Security  Council  Resolution  1272  of \n25 October 1999 placed the country under the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor until \nthe Government announced its independence on 20 May 2002. A UN Mission of Support in East \nTimor replaced the UN transitional administration at that time with plans to withdraw gradually \nfrom the country.5 \n \n8. \nThe spate of violence in April and May 2006, triggered mainly by tensions between the \npolice, the military, and the youths, drove more than half of Dili\u2019s 150,000 residents from their \nhomes and into overcrowded camps. Damage to property was significant: houses were looted \nand burned. The UN Security Council therefore authorized the creation of a new UN Integrated \nMission in Timor-Leste on 25 August 2006 with the priority task of restoring public security. In \nthe course of recovery, the country was beset from time to time by civil unrest, especially during \nthe presidential and parliamentary election in mid-2007.  \n \n9. \nTimor-Leste  countered  the  shock  of  the  attempted  assassination  of  the  President  and \nthe Prime Minister by military rebels on 11 February 2008 with resilience. Many feared that the \ncountry was reverting to violence, but a stronger government emerged from the incident and its \naftermath. Of the three security challenges identified by the Government, military rebels are no \nlonger  a  threat,  and  progress  on  the  other  two  difficult  issues\u2014the  settlement  of  claims  of \ndiscrimination  raised  by  a  group  of  former  soldiers  (\u201cpetitioners\u201d)  and  the  return  of  internally \ndisplaced persons\u2014has won the Government further credit.6 Since early 2008, political stability \nhas prevailed. \n \nThe  UN  Integrated  Mission  in  Timor-Leste  has  worked  with  the  Government  and \n10. \ndevelopment  partners  to  tackle  the  security  and  stability  issues  and  prevent  a  relapse  into \nconflict. It has adopted a medium-term strategy with four priority areas: (i) security and stability, \nnow and in the future; (ii) the rule of law, justice, and human rights; (iii) a culture of democratic \n\n                                                 \n3   The six border posts will be at Mota Ain, Tunubibi, Salele, Sakato, Passabe, and Oesilo. \n4   Coffee accounts for over 75% of Timor-Leste exports excluding gas and oil. The inadequacy of road infrastructure \n\nin the western mountainous areas has adversely affected coffee production and rural development. \n\n5   The  UN  Mission  of  Support  in  East  Timor  was  succeeded  by  the  UN  Office  in  Timor-Leste  (UNOTIL),  with  a \nmuch-reduced  staff,  by  UN  Security  Council  Resolution  1599  on  28  April  2005  to  support  the  development  of \npolice, border patrol, and other critical institutions. \n\n6   International Crisis Group. 2009. Timor-Leste: No Time for Complacency. Brussels. \n\n\fgovernance and dialogue; and (iv) socioeconomic development.7 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  with  its  comparative  advantage  in  infrastructure  development,  has  been  asked  by  the \nGovernment to address the constraints on physical infrastructure, particularly in the road sector. \nIn past ADB projects, damaged sections of road were repaired to facilitate humanitarian relief or \nsecurity  operations.  Now  the  economy  is  growing  fast,  and  the  road  network  needs  more \ncomprehensive and sustainable improvements to support socioeconomic development.  \n \n11. \nRoad  conditions  and maintenance  backlog. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \nAccording  to  a  road  condition  survey  in  2009,  the  national  road  network  has  almost  entirely \ndeteriorated and is no longer maintainable.8 Journeys are longer, vehicle operating costs higher, \nand rural communities more isolated. Significant income from agriculture and other products is \nlost and social conditions are worsening. The small and isolated market with poor transport links \nis preventing the country from exploiting economies of scale and comparative advantage. About \n$110  million  (in  mid-2009  prices)  is  needed  immediately  to  restore  the  priority  roads  to \nmaintainable condition, without upgrading or realignment. However, the Government and local \nindustry have neither the financing resources nor the capacity for quick rehabilitation. Moreover, \nthe  actual  investment  needs  will  be  significantly  higher  than  $110  million,  given  the  rate  of \ndeterioration during the implementation of a sector development program. \n \n12. \nRoad  infrastructure  must  be  preserved  through  routine  and  periodic  maintenance. \nRoutine  maintenance  will  clear  drainage  and  small  landslips  promptly,  keep  vegetation  under \ncontrol,  and  repair  surface  damage  in  its  early  stages.  Periodic  maintenance  to  restore  road \nsurfaces damaged by traffic abrasion and wet-season erosion could help to postpone the need \nfor \nreconstruction.  The  maintenance  works  should  be  programmed \nsystematically to allocate limited resources more efficiently and effectively over the entire road \nnetwork.  The  annual  maintenance  expenditure  for  the  whole  core  road  network  (about \n1,600 km)  in  its  present  condition  is  estimated  at  $25  million.  But  improving  the  roads  to \nmaintainable  condition  will  reduce  the  expenditure  to  about  $10.5 million.  In  2009,  the \nGovernment allocated only about $3.7 million for the maintenance of all national, district, urban, \nand rural roads.  \n \n13. \nRoad safety. The Timor-Leste National Police reported 1,656 cases of road accidents in \n2008; of these, 50 resulted in fatalities, 215 in serious injuries, and 1,020 in other injuries. Many \nless-serious, unreported cases were not included. The actual number of injuries and fatalities is \nbelieved to be higher. Sixty percent of all reported accidents are attributed to human error, 25% \nto  road  conditions,  10%  to  the  weather,  and  5%  to  mechanical  failure.  The  potential  for \neven-higher  accident  rates  is  great,  considering  the  increased  number  of  vehicles,  many  of \nthem  unprotected  motorcycles  carrying  up  to  four  people,  and  the  increased  vehicle  speeds \nmade possible by economic growth and road improvements. \n \nGovernment  capacity.  The  weak  capacity  of  the  Government  to  manage  the  road \n14. \nnetwork also constrains road sector development. The Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood \nControl  (DRBFC)  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  the  central  agency  responsible  for \nplanning, developing, and maintaining road infrastructure, has only 12 engineers\u2014seven at the \nheadquarters  in  Dili  and  five  in  regional  offices.  Each  regional  engineer  is  assisted  by  a \n\nrehabilitation  or \n\n                                                 \n7   United Nations. 2009.

DRBFC\u2019s main weakness is the shortage of capable \nstaff in the districts to program, administer, and supervise roadworks. \n \n15. \nCapacity  of  national  contractors.  National  contractors  are  awarded  projects  of  up  to \n$1.5 million by the Government but may not always have the technical and financial capacity to \nimplement  these  projects  properly.  The  lack  of  project  management  expertise  and  skills \nexcludes  national  contractors  from  large  projects.  The  Government  is  developing  a  contractor \nregistration  system,  which  will  classify  contractors  according  to  financial,  technical,  and \nmanagement  capacity.  The  classification  will  be  linked  to  the  size  and  type  of  contracts  for \nwhich a contractor is eligible to bid. \n \n\nOpportunities \n\n2. \n \n16. \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy.  The  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  country  is  contained  in  the \nNational Development Plan, which sets targets in governance, culture, economy, environment, \neducation,  infrastructure,  and  living  standards  to  be  achieved  by  2020. 9  In  regard  to  the \ninfrastructure  sectors,  according  to the  plan,  \u201cpeople  will  no  longer  be  isolated,  because  there \nwill  be  good  roads,  transport,  electricity,  and  communications  in  the  towns  and  villages,  in  all \nregions  of  the  country.\u201d  Recognizing  the  importance  of  infrastructure  to  all  sectors  of  the \neconomy and society, the Government also calls attention in the plan to the need \u201cto plan for, \nprovide  and  manage  physical  infrastructure  that  is  efficient,  cost-effective,  and  financially \nsustainable, and which supports the social and economic development priorities of the people of \nTimor-Leste.\u201d \n \nThe Government is preparing a medium-term strategic plan setting the key priorities for \n17. \ndevelopment,  with  specific  goals  and  objectives.10 The  three  medium-term  strategic  objectives \nwill  be  (i) poverty  reduction,  (ii) private  sector  development,  and  (iii) core  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  five  core  infrastructure  sectors  will  be  (i) roads  and  bridges;  (ii) ports  and \nand \nairports; \n(v) telecommunications.  Since  2008,  the  Government  has  announced  its  national  priorities \nyearly. Future priorities will be guided by the medium-term strategic plan once it is approved. \n \n18.  While  the  strategic  plan  is  still  in  preparation,  the  Government  announced  the  national \npriorities  for  2010  under  the  plan\u2019s  framework  on  23  May  2009.  The  large  increase  in \ngovernment  expenditure  and  growth  in  agriculture  buoyed  up  the  economy  in  2008,  but  the \nrising  incidence  of  poverty  and  high  unemployment  point  to  the  need  for  better-targeted \ngovernment  spending  to  answer  the  lack  of  basic  services  and  the  underdevelopment  in  the \ncountryside.  Roads  and  water  supply  infrastructure  are  top  priorities  for  2010,  reflecting  the \nmajor  constraint  their  insufficiency  imposes  on  the  country\u2019s  long-term  development  and \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  Government  has  also  urged  the  line  ministries  and \ndevelopment partners to align their budgets with national priorities. The development of the road \nsector, one of the most important infrastructure sectors, is widely recognized as a key factor in \ncreating  jobs,  promoting  private  sector  growth,  attracting  business  investments,  increasing \nagricultural  productivity,  and  reducing  poverty.  As  the  road  sector  gains  high  priority  in  the \ndevelopment agenda of Timor-Leste, the Government plans to significantly increase its budget \nallocation to road sector in the near future. \n\n(iv) electricity; \n\nand  water \n\n(iii) dams, \n\nschemes \n\nirrigation \n\nsupply; \n\n                                                 \n9   Planning Commission. 2002.

The  medium-term  strategic  plan  was  expected  to  be  considered  by  the  Council  of \nMinisters in September 2009, and then presented to the National Parliament for approval. \n\n\f \nA  road  sector  investment  program  was  developed  in  2005.11 Noting  the  changes  that \n19. \nhave occurred since then in traffic volume, road conditions, and financing resources, the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants  surveyed  road  conditions  nationwide  and \nundertook  classified  traffic  counts  and  origin\u2013destination  surveys  from  December  2008  to \nMarch 2009.  A  new  medium-term  road  network  development  program  based  on  the  survey \nresults and findings of stakeholder consultations is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nSector  development  and  external  assistance.  While  strategic  planning  by  the \n20. \nGovernment  is  making  progress,  there  is  a  need  for  better  coordination  with  development \npartners. Working groups with members from government agencies and development partners \ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  annual  national  priority  programs.  The \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) has set up the Directorate for Aid Effectiveness for more transparent \nand  harmonized  external  aid  flows.  Budget  and  aid  information  is  circulated  at  the  quarterly \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  meeting,  cochaired  by  the  ministers  of  foreign  affairs  and  finance.  MOI \nalso plans to meet regularly with development partners to coordinate external assistance.  \n \n21. \nRoad sector development in Timor-Leste has relied heavily on external assistance, with \nADB leading the development partners since 1999. A joint assessment mission coordinated by \nthe World Bank was fielded in October\u2013November 1999 to prepare a medium-term restoration \nprogram. Two emergency infrastructure rehabilitation projects were administered by ADB under \nthe  restoration  program.12 The  two  projects  facilitated  peace,  security,  and  humanitarian  relief \naid by attending to immediate infrastructure failures in sectors such as roads, ports, and power. \nMeanwhile,  an  ADB  TA  grant  from  2000  to  2002  supported  the  first  steps  in  establishing  the \ninstitutions and regulatory frameworks for road, port, and airport operation and management.13 \nA  second  ADB  TA  project,  for  Transport  Sector  Improvement,  prepared  a  medium-term  road \ninvestment program in 2005. The priority roads under the program were included in ADB-funded \nRoad Sector Improvement Project (RSIP), which was completed in September 2009.14 \n \n22. \nTo  support  the  Government\u2019s  capital  development  program  and  build  capacity  in  the \ninfrastructure  sectors,  ADB  provided  TA  for  Infrastructure Sectors  Capacity  Development  from \n2005  to  2008  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $600,000,15 and  follow-up  TA  for  Infrastructure  Project \nManagement  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $15  million  cofinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development.16 \n \n23. \nSince 2000, the Government of Japan has provided $34.6 million in grants for transport, \n54% of this total for road improvements and for project studies and training in the road sector. \nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded a TA project for capacity building in \nroad  maintenance,  and  another  TA  project  for  the  preparation  of  guidelines  and  manuals  for \nroads. The next JICA-funded TA, for capacity building for road works, will be implemented from \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2001.

The  European  Union  has  also  provided  about  $50  million \nthrough three rural development programs, each one with a rural road rehabilitation component. \nUnder  the  second  rural  development  program,  five  bridges  on  the  road  from  Viqueque  to \nUatucarbau were rehabilitated or reconstructed. A list of external assistance to the road sector \nis in Appendix 3. \n \n24. \nSubregional  cooperation  and  integration.  Despite  their  history,  Indonesia  and \nTimor-Leste  are  moving  in  a  very  positive  direction.  Cooperation  with  Indonesia,  the  main \nsource  of  most  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  imports,  including  rice,  fuel,  construction  materials,  and  other \ncommodities, is expanding. In 2008, Indonesia was the largest source of Timor-Leste\u2019s imports \nand its third-largest export market.17 Membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nin  2012  will  increase  the  opportunities  for  cooperation  between  these  two  countries.  At  an \nADB-hosted  workshop \nfor  archipelagic  Southeast  Asia\u2013Pacific  subregional  cooperation \nprograms  on  19\u201320  February  2009,  senior  officials  from  Indonesia,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and \nTimor-Leste, discussed the needs and action plans for subregional cooperation. A regional TA \nproject  is  being  prepared  by  ADB  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  Timor-Leste  and \nPapua New Guinea to improve the cross-border economic corridors. \n \n25.  Most  households  in  the  border  regions  of  Timor-Leste  and  Indonesia  consider  border \ntrade  to  be  their  primary  source  of  income.  Family  reunions  and  ceremonies  also  generate \ndemand for border crossing since many Timor-Leste citizens have close relatives in Indonesian \nWest Timor. Among other constraints, the poor cross-border facilities and the poor condition of \nborder roads in Timor-Leste make cross-border trade and activities more difficult. Roads have \nbeen upgraded and border posts constructed on the Indonesia side, but not on the Timor-Leste \nside.  To  facilitate  cross-border  commercial  or  social  activities,  Timor-Leste  must  improve  its \ncross-border  facilities  and  national  roads  in  the  border  regions.  Improved  connectivity  in  the \nborder  areas  will  create  economic  benefits,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  the  country\u2019s \nengagement in subregional cooperation and integration. \n \n\nLessons \n\n3. \n \nSeveral  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  and  ongoing  road  projects  in  Timor-Leste: \n26. \n(i) difficult  terrain,  geology,  and  weather  conditions  require  more  intensive  routine  and \npreventive  maintenance  of  the  road  network;  (ii) the  period  of  road  construction  is  essentially \nreduced  by  4\u20136  months  of  rainy  season  every  year;  (iii) given  the  crowded  community  of \ndevelopment  partners  in  Timor-Leste,  regular  coordination  is  needed  to  avoid  repetitive \ninvestment; (iv) the capacity of national contractors must be developed through actual works of \nappropriate  size  and  well-targeted \nin \nimplementing  large  projects,  skills  transfer  between  project  management  consultants  and  MOI \nstaff is important in building the capacity of MOI staff. \n \n27. \nAs  the  country\u2019s  economy  grows,  more  attention  should  be  given  to  the  quality  and \nsustainability of road infrastructure. Past ADB projects were aimed at restoring accessibility and \ncentered  on  repairing  only  the  damaged  sections  of  the  road  network.  While  Dili\u2019s  connection \nwith  most  other  areas  of  the  country  improved,  overall  road  conditions  continued  to  worsen \nbecause the Government could not meet the maintenance needs. The ongoing RSIP is the first \nattempt  to  move  from  emergency  work  to  road  development.  It  involves  the  rehabilitation  of \nlonger  stretches  of  road,  labor-intensive  maintenance,  and  community  participation  in  the \n\ntraining,  and  (v) while  MOI  still  needs  support \n\n                                                 \n17  Source: National Statistics Office, Ministry of Finance, Timor-Leste. \n\n\fdevelopment  of  rural  roads.  Further  efforts,  such  as  high-quality  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation projects and periodic review of the road sector master plan, are needed to improve \nroad infrastructure more effectively. The improvement of the core road network, adequate road \nmaintenance,  and  community  participation  in  rural  road  development  must  be  integrated  and \nprogressively  expanded  in  the  course  of  road  sector  development.  To  make  road  sector \ninvestments  sustainable,  stand-alone  maintenance  contracts  should  be  avoided.  A  functioning \nroad maintenance program (RMP), including institutional setup, policy framework, programming \nand implementation capacity, and sufficient budget support, is essential. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n4. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government  in  rehabilitating  priority  national  and  district \nroads under the medium-term road network development program, and in establishing an RMP \nin  the  border  region.  It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  latest  country strategy  and  program  (2006\u20132008), \nwhich identified transport infrastructure improvement as a key area of ADB assistance.18 A new \ninterim  country  strategy  for  2009\u20132012  is  being  prepared  and  will  be  aimed  at  assisting  the \nGovernment in reducing poverty by promoting and supporting inclusive growth. The strategy is \nexpected  to  focus  on  improving  physical  infrastructure,  particularly  rural  connectivity  to  boost \nagricultural  productivity  growth,  generate  employment  opportunities,  and  make  social  service \ndelivery  more  sustainable.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan \n(2008\u20132010) for Timor-Leste.19 \n \n29. \nThe Project will support Timor-Leste\u2019s national priorities and the National Development \nPlan by developing and managing road infrastructure, and promote subregional cooperation by \nimproving  border  post  facilities.  Furthermore,  the  sector-based  approach  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  lead  the  way  in  identifying,  prioritizing,  formulating,  appraising,  approving,  and \nimplementing its sector strategy, and direct resources from development partners. MOI and its \nroad  agency,  DRBFC,  can  thus  implement  the  Project  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  vision  in \nroad sector development, and more actively absorb the knowledge and expertise needed. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  support  road  sector  development  and  thereby  contribute  to  economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in the project areas. It will have an impact on (i) poverty reduction, \n(ii) direct and indirect job creation, and (iii) cross-border trade. \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  access  to  social  and  economic  facilities  in  the  project  areas, \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  cross-border  activities,  reduce  travel  time  and  costs,  and  make  the \nroad network less vulnerable to severe climate. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  finance  a  portion  of  medium-term  road  network  development  program. \n32. \nAt the end of the Project, (i) about 232 km of national or district roads will have been improved \nto maintainable condition; (ii) an RMP will have been established; (iii) access roads and parking \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Manila. \n19 ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010): Timor-Leste. Manila. The Project was initially listed as \n\nthe Second Road Sector Improvement Project. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nareas  will  have  been  built  to  improve  cross-border  facilities  at  Mota  Ain,  Salele,  Sakato,  and \nOesilo;  (iv) national  contractors  will  have  gained  increased  capacity  to  implement  roadworks; \n(v) MOI will have improved its ability to implement road projects and the RMP; (vi) road safety \nawareness  in  the  project  areas  will  have  increased;  and  (vii)  climate-proofing  measures  will \nhave become a regular part of road design and construction. \n \n33. \n \n\nTo achieve the foregoing outputs, the following project activities will be carried out: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRoad  rehabilitation.  About  232  km  of  priority  national  or  district  roads  will  be \nrehabilitated to maintainable condition. Each subproject will be selected from the \nnationwide  core  road  network,  according  to  the  procedure  and  eligibility  criteria \ngiven  in  Appendix  4.  The  medium-term  road  network  development  program  will \nguide  the  selection  of  subprojects.  The  feasibility  study  for  each  subproject  will \nprovide justification of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will conform in \ndegree of detail and quality with what is required for ADB to assess the viability \nand suitability of the subproject. Two sample roads (Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota Ain \nand  Ermera\u2013Maliana,  about  140  km  in  total)  have  been  selected  for  appraisal, \nand will serve as models for the technical, economic, social, and environmental \nassessments  of  non-sample  roads.  The  feasibility  studies  of  the  two  sample \nsubprojects are in Supplementary Appendixes B\u2013G. \nRoad  maintenance  program.  About  302  km  of  national  roads  in  the  border \nregion 20  will  be  maintained  yearly  during  project  implementation.  Contract \npackages appropriate for small national contractors are designed to develop the \nlocal contracting industry. Small contractors will be trained in road maintenance \ntechnology, bidding and contracting, and project management. A summary of the \napproach for establishing the road maintenance program is in Appendix 5. \nConstruction  of  border  post  facilities.  Roads  and  parking  lots  will be  built  at \nthe  border  posts  in  Mota  Ain,  Salele,  Sakato,  and  Oesilo.  The  Government  will \nfinance and administer the design of border post facilities, and procure civil works \nfor roads and parking lots according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). \nConsulting  services.  Consultants  will  be  hired  for  project  management, \nfeasibility study, detailed design, the RMP (including the training of small national \ncontractors), construction supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \n\nEngaging Weakly Performing Countries \n\n1. \n \n34. \nTimor-Leste is a fragile, post-conflict country. The small and isolated market with poor \ntransport links has prevented the country from  exploiting economies of scale and comparative \nadvantage. Management and implementation capacity is very weak. MOI, which is responsible \nfor  all  infrastructure  activities,  cannot  function  fully  because  of  seriously  limited  institutional \ncapacity.  The  project  design  draws  on  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  engaging  with  weakly  performing \ncountries.21 The  approach  entails  (i) promoting  selective  and  sustained  engagement  in  areas \nwhere  ADB  has  comparative  advantage  (the  road  sector  in  Timor-Leste);  (ii) supplementing \ninvestment  financing  with  community-based  approaches  (to  be  implemented  under  a  linked \nproject  proposed  for  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  [JFPR]  financing);  and  (iii)  developing \n\n                                                 \n20 In the districts of Bobonaro, Covalima, and Oecussi. \n21 ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries. Manila. \n\n\fcapacity to promote ownership of development processes (reflected mainly in the design of the \ntraining  program  for  national  contractors  and  the  RMP  to  be  established  by  the  project \nmanagement unit [PMU] and handed over to MOI midway through project implementation). \n \n\n2. \n\nBuilding  the  Capacity  of  the  Directorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood \nControl  \n\n \n35. \nThe Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control of MOI oversees the road sector. \nHowever, its operation is heavily constrained by its current staff capacity of only 12 engineers\u2014\nseven  at  headquarters  and  one  in  each  of  the  five  regional  offices.  The  Project  will  provide \non-the-job  training  to  counterpart  DRBFC  staff  to  complement  the  ADB  TA  for  Infrastructure \nProject  Management,  which  was  designed  to  strengthen  MOI\u2019s  project  management  capacity \nand facilitate budget execution (footnote 16). The PMU will also involve DRBFC in the selection, \nappraisal,  detailed  engineering,  and  construction  supervision  of  road  rehabilitation  subprojects \nto facilitate the transfer of skills to DRBFC. \n \n\nBuilding the Capacity of Small Contractors  \n\n3. \n \n36. \nAccording  to  DRBFC,  there  are  about  180  small  contractors  in  Timor-Leste  with \nexperience in implementing road maintenance and rehabilitation works. The Project will promote \nthe  growth  of  a  contracting  industry  for  small-scale  civil  works,  which  is  now  underinvested \nbecause  of  a  lack  of  business  opportunities,  along  with  opportunities  for  training  and  skills \ndevelopment.  Most  national  contractors  do  not  have  enough  knowledge  and  skills  to  do  road \nconstruction work, prepare bids, or manage a business. The Project will hire consultants to train \nsmall  contractors.  Participation  in  the  training  will  be  a  prerequisite  for  bidding  for  road \nmaintenance contracts.  \n \n\nCreating Jobs \n\n4. \n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  create  jobs.  The  civil  works,  including  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance  and  bioengineering,  will  generate  about  22,000  person-months  of  employment. \nThere  will  be \nthus  sustainable \nemployment,  under  the  RMP.  In  the  three  pilot  districts,  the  RMP  will  provide  about \n8,580 person-months  of  employment  in  4  years.  After  the  Government  expands  it  to  all \n13 districts, the job opportunities will increase significantly.  \n \n\nlong-term  business  opportunities \n\nfor  contractors,  and \n\nFacilitating Subregional Cooperation and Integration \n\n5. \n \n38. \nThe  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  national  roads  in  the  border  region,  and  the \nconstruction  of  four  border  posts  on  the  national  road  network,  will  further  the  progress  of \ncooperation with Indonesia. The maintenance works on roads linking three districts in the border \nareas will also give the rest of the country better access to cross-border activities.  \n \n\nEstablishing a Road Maintenance Program  \n\n6. \n \n39. \nDelayed and inadequate maintenance is a major cause of premature road deterioration \nin  Timor-Leste.  Proper  maintenance  is  generally  regarded  as  the  most  effective  way  of \npreserving  the  value  of  road  assets.  The  Project  will  help  the  DRBFC  to  establish  an  RMP, \ninitially in the border region. MOI is expected to replicate the model in other regions. To set up \nthe  RMP,  the  Project  will  coordinate  with  the  team  of  JICA-funded  consultants  that  will  be \nengaged in operating the road maintenance management database and equipment. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fImproving Road Safety \n\n7. \n \n40. \nPoor road safety is the increasing cause of injuries and loss of life and property. As the \neconomy grows, road travel for social and economic activities will also grow. Most trips are now \nmade on unprotected motorcycles carrying up to four passengers. Better roads will make higher \nvehicle  speeds  possible  and  thus heighten  the  risk  of  road  accidents.  Road  safety  awareness \nprograms will be conducted for road users and roadside communities. Traffic safety measures \nwill also be incorporated into the Project, from engineering design to civil works implementation.  \n \n\nAdapting to Climate Change \n\n8. \n \n41. \nBeing  a  highly  mountainous,  small-island  country  makes  Timor-Leste  especially \nvulnerable  to  the  impact  of  climate  change.  The  impact  can  be  far  reaching  because  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  low  level  of  development  and  dependence  on  climate-dependent  economic  sectors, \nand  its  low  capacity  to  adapt.  Some  projected  changes  can  intensify  drought  in  some  regions \nand floods in others, reduce agricultural productivity, and damage coastal roads as the sea level \nrises.  Much  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  transportation  infrastructure  is  in  highly  sensitive  areas,  where \nlandslides,  land  degradation  and  sedimentation,  and  even  the  complete  disappearance  of \ncoastal  roads  are  constant  risks.  The  Project  will  build  climate-proofing  measures  into  road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  by considering future  climate  data  when  reviewing  engineering \ndesigns and plans and by making adaptation measures part of the environmental management \nplan (EMP). The models to be developed through the Project can influence the Government\u2019s \nroad sector strategy and thus have an impact beyond the Project. \n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nEncouraging Community Participation in Roadworks \n\n9. \n \n42. \nBesides  the  Project,  a  linked  project\u2014Our  Roads,  Our  Future:  Supporting  Local \nGovernance  and  Community-Based  Infrastructure  Works\u2014will  be  proposed  for  financing  from \nthe  JFPR.  The  linked  project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  strategy  and \ncommunity-based  infrastructure  works  in  Timor-Leste.  It  will  (i) extend  the  socioeconomic \nbenefits  of  the  national  road  improvements  under  the  Project  to  roadside  communities,  and \n(ii) develop  a  model  for  sustainable  community  participation  in  community  infrastructure  work \nwith local government. The linked JFPR project will be implemented in the districts of Bobonaro, \nCovalima, and Oecussi, which overlap with the areas covered by the RMP under the Project. A \nsummary of the linked JFPR project is in Appendix 6. \n \nD. \n \n43. \ntaxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  is  estimated  at  $52.90  million.

The Asian Development Fund grant will finance all foreign exchange cost, local cost for \nconsulting  services,  equipment,  project  management,  95%  of  cost  of  civil  works  for  access \nroads and parking areas of border posts, 90% of the cost of civil works for the rehabilitation of \nabout  232  km  of  national  roads,  70%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for  road  maintenance. \nCounterpart funds of $6.9 million from the Government will cover 5% of the cost of civil works \nfor  access  roads  and  parking  areas  of  border  posts,  10%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for  road \nrehabilitation,  30%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for  road  maintenance,  and  any  taxes  and  duties, \nland acquisition and resettlement costs, and right-of-way costs.

MOI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  project  management.  It  will \noperate  through  its  PMU,  which  was  established  under  the  Emergency  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  Project  2  and  inherited  by  RSIP.  Assessments  of  procurement  capacity  and \nfinancial  management  recommend  this  PMU  arrangement,  considering  the  weak  capacity  of \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nMOI  (Supplementary  Appendixes  H\u2013I).  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) overall  project \nimplementation;  (ii) stakeholder  consultation  and  coordination;  (iii) the  procurement  of  goods, \nworks,  and  consulting  services  for  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance; 22  (iv) contract \nadministration; (v) sector development support to MOI; and (vi) on-the-job training of counterpart \nMOI staff. (Outline terms of reference for the PMU are in Supplementary Appendix J.) Individual \nconsultants will be hired for the project management staff through competitive recruitment.23 \n \n46.  MOI  will  assign  counterpart  staff  from  DRBFC  to  the  PMU  to  participate  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  RMP.  The  PMU  will \nprovide these counterpart staff with on-the-job training to enable DRBFC eventually to take over \nthe RMP and to build DRBFC capacity for regular road project management. At the end of the \nProject,  the  PMU  will  be  integrated  into  MOI\u2019s  permanent  institutional  setup,  and  the  national \nstaff of the PMU will be absorbed by MOI. \n \n47. \nADB  will  finance  the  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  of  the  PMU  for \nimplementing the Project and supporting sector development. ADB financing is justified because \n(i) the capacity of MOI for project implementation and sector development is limited and needs \nto  be  strengthened,  (ii) the  PMU\u2019s  performance  in  previous  projects  has  been  satisfactory  to \nboth  the  Government  and  ADB,  (iii) the  PMU\u2019s  knowledge  of  and  working  experience  with \nADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines  will  speed  up  project  implementation,  and  (iv) the  PMU\u2019s \neffectiveness in capacity development has been proven by the promotion of the previous project \nmanager to the position of minister of MOI, and the material engineer to secretary of state for \npublic works. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be \n\n \n48. \nimplemented  over  5  years,  with  physical  completion  by \nNovember 2014.  To  give  MOI  enough  time  to  withdraw  funds  from  the  grant  account,  the \nProject  has  been  set  to  close  on  31  May  2015,  6  months  after  physical  completion.  The \npre-rehabilitation  activities\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  tendering,  and \nawarding of contracts\u2014will start in January 2010. Civil works for sample roads are expected to \nstart  in  September  2010.  For  non-sample  roads,  the  MOI  will  start  subproject  appraisals  in \nJanuary 2011. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll procurement under the Project will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \n49. \nas amended from time to time). All contracts over $1 million for civil works and $0.5 million for \ngoods will undergo international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts below those amounts will \ngo  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  or,  as  appropriate  for  works  contracts  up  to \n$100,000,  through  shopping  (A  procurement  plan,  including  suitable  contract  packaging  to \nattract international contractors and promote the national contracting industry, is in Appendix 9.) \nThe procurement of all contract packages for road rehabilitation, the first five contract packages \nfor  road  maintenance,  and  all  contract  packages  for  border  post  construction  will  require  prior \nreview by ADB. Other road maintenance packages will be reviewed after procurement. \n\n                                                 \n22  The  construction  of  border  post  facilities  is  in  the  Government's  project  pipeline  for  2009  and  2010.  Only  the \nconstruction of access roads and parking areas will be funded by the Project. The procurement unit of the MOF will \nprocure the civil works, and the PMU will administer the construction of the access roads and parking areas. \n\n23  In  view  of  the  difficulty  of  hiring  well-qualified  national  consultants  in  Timor-Leste,  the  financial  administrator \n(national) and road maintenance engineer (national) of PMU, who were competitively recruited in 2003 under the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project 2, will be retained in PMU through contract extensions. \n\n\f4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n50. \nA consulting firm will be hired as project implementation support consultant (PISC) under \nthe  Project  to  provide  497  person-months  of  consulting  services  (141  international  and \n356   national).  The  PISC  will  support  the  PMU  in  (i) subproject  appraisal,  (ii) detailed  design, \n(iii) RMP  preparation  and  implementation  including  the  training  of  national  contractors, \n(iv) construction supervision, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. (Outline terms of reference for \nthe PISC are in Supplementary Appendix K.) The recruitment will be made through quality- and \ncost-based selection following ADB\u2019s prior review, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Financial  audit  consultants  will  be  hired \nthrough least-cost selection. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption and Governance Measures  \n\n \n51. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOI.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nAn information disclosure system will be established by (i) displaying, on notice boards \n52. \noutside  government  offices  and  important  public  places  in  roadside  communities,  information \nregarding  contracts,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic \ndetails on bidding procedures, the contract award, and the list of goods and services procured; \n(ii) notifying  the  communities  of  the  date  and  location  of  selected  events  in  the  procurement \nprocess  (e.g.,  public  bid  openings,  progress  reviews,  and  handover  ceremonies);  and \n(iii) establishing a grievance redress mechanism at the PMU to receive and resolve complaints \nand grievances from communities, contractors, etc. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n53. \nThe  grant  proceeds  for  the  Project  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, the imprest account will be set up in a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe imprest account will be managed by PMU under the supervision of MOI and MOF, and will \nbe  used  exclusively  to  finance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  MOF,  through  its \nauthorization,  will  ensure  that  withdrawals  from  the  imprest  account  are  managed  by  two \nsignatories,  one  from  MOI/PMU  and  another  from  the  treasury  department  of  MOF.  The \nproposed  signatories  for  the  withdrawal  application  and  the  operation  of  the  imprest  account \nmust have ADB\u2019s prior approval. The initial advance to be deposited in the imprest account will \nbe  based  on  6 months\u2019  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or \n$500,000,  whichever  is  less.  If  needed,  the  imprest  account  ceiling  may  be  adjusted  during \nimplementation,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  requirements  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  The  amount  in  the  imprest  account  may  not  at  any  time  exceed  10%  of  the  total \nADB  grant.  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used  for  eligible  project \nexpenditures  under  large  contracts.  Such  an  arrangement  is  supported  by  a  financial \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nmanagement  assessment  of  the  MOI\u2019s  and  the  PMU\u2019s  performance  in  previous  projects \n(Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of \n54. \nthe  procurement  of  civil  works.  Advance  contracting  actions  cover \nconsultants  and \nprequalification,  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  limited  contract  award.  The \nadvance actions must conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n55. \nTo  meet  the  implementation  schedule,  the  pre-construction  activities  will  start  in  2009. \nThe  Project  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  project  management  related  consulting \nservices,  and  civil  works.  24 Retroactive  financing  will  be  permitted  only  if  (i)  ADB  and  the \nBorrower specifically agree to it in the grant agreement, and only pursuant to the terms of the \nrelevant agreement; (ii) the goods, works, services, and consultants for which it is requested are \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants; and (iii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not exceed 10% of the grant \n(a higher amount may be allowed only with ADB\u2019s approval). The expenditure must also have \nbeen  incurred  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  grant,  but  no  earlier  than  12  months  before  the \nsigning date of the grant agreement. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n56.  MOI, with assistance from the PMU, will maintain separate project records and accounts \nadequate  to  identify  (i) the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant  proceeds,  (ii) the \nfinancing  resources  received  from  each  financier,  (ii)  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the \ncomponents of the Project and their financing resources, and (iv) the counterpart funds received \nand expended. MOI will hire independent external auditors acceptable to ADB for a yearly audit \nof the project accounts, including project expenditures and transactions, imprest accounts, and \ncounterpart  funds.  MOI  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited  annual  project \naccounts,  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s  report,  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year \nduring  the  implementation  period.  The  audit  opinion  will  cover  (i) an  assessment  of  the \nadequacy of accounting and internal control systems for project expenditures and transactions \nto ensure safe custody of assets financed by the Project; (ii) a determination as to whether the \nGovernment  and  MOI  have  adequately  documented  all  financial  transactions,  specifically \nimprest  account  procedures;  and  (iii) confirmation  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for \nproject management. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account procedure \nwill also be part of the audit report. ADB\u2019s policy on the submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due dates, has been \nexplained  to  the  Government.  If  there  is  more  than  6 months\u2019  delay  in  the  submission  of  an \naudited  financial  statement,  ADB  may  not  approve  new  contract  awards.  If  the  delay  is  more \nthan 12 months, grant disbursements may be suspended or the grant may be canceled outright. \n \n57.  MOI, through the PMU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports giving \n(i) a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period,  (ii) changes  in  the \nimplementation  schedule,  (iii) projected  expenditures  in  the  next  6 months,  (iv) problems  or \ndifficulties  encountered,  (v) an  account  of  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  (if  any), \nand (vi) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. MOI will prepare and submit to \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB\u2019s management review meeting (MRM) for the Project approved advance actions on 23 July 2009. \n\n\fADB a subproject completion report within 3 months of the completion of each subproject, and a \nproject completion report within 6 months after project completion. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n58. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  agree  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  project  performance  in \nrelation  to  its  impact  and  outcomes,  consistent  with  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in \nAppendix  1,  and  with  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction.  Consultants  will  be  hired  by  MOI  to \nmonitor  and  evaluate  the  key  indicators  for  road  transport  characteristics,  income  patterns, \naccess to social services, and environmental issues. A baseline survey will establish a database \nof existing conditions, and there will be yearly follow-up rounds of data collection. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n59. \nADB  will  review  the  Project  every  6  months.  Each  review  will  cover  all  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may affect the performance of the Project \nand its continuing viability. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of \nthe Project within about 2 years of its start. The midterm review will focus on (i) project impact, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) the performance of consultants and contractors, (v) the status \nof  compliance  with  covenants  in  the  grant  agreement,  and  (vi) the  need  for  any  midcourse \nchanges in project scope or schedule to ensure full achievement of the intended impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n60. \nPreliminary  economic  analyses  have  been  prepared  for  63  national  or  district  links \n(about  1,675 km)  in  the  core  road  network.  The  economic  analysis  used  the  roads  economic \ndecision  model  developed  by  the  World  Bank,  with  input  derived  from  the  analysis  and \nassessment  of  transport  and  traffic  surveys,  and  road  condition  surveys,  both  done  in  early \n2009. Cost and benefit streams with and without the Project over a 20-year period, discounted \nat  an  interest  rate  of  12%,  were  analyzed.  Thirty-two  priority  road  links  (about  972 km)  were \nrecommended for immediate investment. \n \n61. \nTwo road links were selected as sample subprojects for rehabilitation. The work will be \nundertaken  within  the  existing  road  alignments.  Detailed  economic  analyses  have  been \nprepared  for  the  two  road  links  (Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota  Ain  and  Ermera\u2013Maliana)  as  part  of \nthe sample feasibility study under the project preparatory TA. The two sample subprojects have \neconomic internal rates of return of 25% and 26%. \n \nB. \n \n62. \nIn Timor-Leste, about three-quarters of the poor live in the rural areas and one-quarter in \nthe urban areas.25 At the national level, 64% of the poor, and 76% of the non-poor, have access \nto all-weather roads. According to the TLSLS 2007 results, 80% of the total poor population and \n90%  of  the  rural  poor  depend  on  agriculture.  Improving  access  to  markets  can  contribute  to \npoverty  reduction  by  increasing  farming  inputs.  According  to  the  June  2007  crop  and  food \nsupply  assessment  mission  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  and  the  World  Food \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Impact \n\n                                                 \n25 Ministry of Finance and the World Bank. 2008. Timor-Leste: Poverty in a Young Nation. Dili. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nProgramme  to  Timor-Leste,  38%\u201354%  of  households  suffer  food  shortages  3\u20135  months  per \nyear in most districts. The road improvements will lead to increased marketing, and increased \nhousehold incomes. With improved access to local and regional markets and towns, farmers will \nbe  able  to  expand  and  diversify  their  agricultural  production.  People  can  get  better  prices  for \ntheir  products  when  they  sell  at  larger  markets  or  directly  to  factories  rather  than  through \nmiddlemen. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n63. \nBetter  access  to  health  facilities  will  improve  the  health  of  the  people,  in  particular \nwomen  and  children.  The  people  of  Timor-Leste  are  vulnerable  to  respiratory  diseases, \ndiarrheal  malaria,  dengue  fever,  tuberculosis,  leprosy,  and  other  treatable  diseases.  Improved \naccess to health-care facilities will encourage people to seek medical assistance. Better roads \nwill  also  ease  travel  to  schools,  and  help  strengthen  the  school  system  by  reducing  teacher \nabsentee rates and enabling school to attract more qualified teachers.  \n \n64. \nIn Timor-Leste, sociocultural factors contribute to low enrollment and high dropout rates \namong  female  students,  high  illiteracy  among  adult  females,  high  female  unemployment,  sex \nsegregation in the paid labor force, an emerging gender gap in wages, high maternal mortality, \nand domestic violence. About 28% of women suffer from malnutrition; of these, 7% are in need \nof treatment. The gender-specific benefits of the Project are (i) improved access to health-care \nfacilities;  (ii) improved  access  to  schools,  social  services,  and  other  key  facilities;  and \n(iii) targeted employment opportunities for female laborers, such as bioengineering. \n \nC. \n \nThe Project is a category B project, according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \n65. \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental \n(2003),  and \nregulations.26 Accordingly,  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  it. \nSelection  criteria  have  been  set  to  ensure  that  future  subprojects  comply  with  the  project \nenvironmental  classification.  An  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  has  been \nprepared  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L;  it  presents  the  general  environmental  impact  of  the \nproject  activities,  the selection  criteria,  and  environmental  procedures  for  future  subprojects.  It \nwill  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of  the  subprojects  likely  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject, and the approval of those assessments. The summary IEE is in Appendix 11.  \n \n66. \nThe  habitats  in  both  subproject  areas  have  been  affected  by  human  interference \n(anthropogenic  influence)  and  have  no  legal  conservation  status.  Proper  mitigation  measures \nhave been proposed in the EMP to ensure that environmental impact is minimized to acceptable \nlevels. The EMP will be incorporated into the design of the road subprojects. The EMP will guide \nMOI and the contractors in managing environmental impact mitigation and compliance. The IEE \nand  the  EMP  for  each  subproject  must  be  approved  by  ADB  and  the  National  Directorate  of \nEnvironmental  Services  before  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  can  be  issued.  The \nenvironmental  management  capacity  of  the  DRBFC  will  be  strengthened  through  on-the-job \ntraining  in  EMP  implementation  and  compliance  monitoring.  The  training  may  extend  to  the \nrelevant officers of the Directorate of Environmental Services as requested.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n26 United Nations Transitional  Administration  in East Timor. 2003. Guideline 1: Environmental Requirements for the \n\nDevelopment Proposals. Dili. \n\n\fClimate Change Adaptation \n\nD. \n \n67. \nUnderstanding  how  climate  change  may  affect  the  road  sector  will  allow  appropriate \nmeasures  to  be  taken  to  avoid  losses  due  to  climate  change  and  to  take  advantage  of \nopportunities that arise. Taking into consideration the impact of climate change and formulating \nadaptation  measures  to  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design  will  minimize  the  adverse \nimpact,  hence,  ensure  that  the  Project  achieves  its  poverty  reduction  goals.  Peak  rainfall,  the \nmost important climate parameter in road engineering, will be the focus of the climate analysis. \nA \u201cno-regret\u201d approach to climate-proofing will be taken to minimize the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nthe  adverse  effects  of  climate  change  and  minimize  risks  of  road  sector  investment.  The \ntechnical approach of climate proofing is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n \n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \nThe  Project  is  a  category  B  project  with  respect  to  involuntary  resettlement.  The  civil \n68. \nworks  under  the  Project  will  be  conducted  within  existing  road  alignments;  therefore,  only \nminimal  temporary  impact  on  land  or  resettlement  impact  is  expected. 27  The  number  of \nhouseholds that may experience incidental impact from civil works will be small. The two sample \nroads have been screened and their impact on involuntary resettlement has been determined to \nbe minor or insignificant. The impact will be assessed through the screening of each subproject.  \nA resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix N) has been prepared for the Project as a \nprecaution.  The  resettlement  framework  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995)  and  relevant  sections  of  the  Operations  Manual28 and  Gender  Checklist:  Resettlement \n(2003),29 as well as the process that has been adopted when land or assets have to be acquired \nfor civil works in Timor-Leste. The resettlement framework will guide MOI and PMU in preparing \nand implementing resettlement plans for subprojects requiring resettlement. A summary of the \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n \nIn  Timor-Leste,  ethnic  association  is  bound  up  with  language.  Seventeen  languages, \n69. \nderived  from  one  of  two  broad  language  groups\u2014Austronesian  (Malayo-Polynesian)  and \nPapuan  (Melanesian)\u2014are  spoken  across  the  country.  The  social  assessment  concluded  that \nno  significant  differences  in  cultural  and  social  identity  exist  among  the  people  who  speak \ndifferent languages, and that no ethnic minority groups are expected to be adversely affected by \nthe  Project.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  a  category B  project  with  respect  to  the  ADB  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). If necessary, actions will be taken through resettlement frameworks \nand resettlement plans. \n \nF. \n \n70. \n \n\nThe Project makes several assumptions and is subject to various risks, as follows: \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n                                                 \n27 Resettlement,  as  defined  in  ADB  policy,  involves  permanent  or  temporary  impact  caused  by  (i) the  acquisition  of \nland  or  other  fixed  assets;  (ii) a  change  in  the  use  of  land;  or  (iii) restrictions  imposed  on  land,  regardless  of \nwhether it involves actual relocation. \n\n28  ADB. 2006. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2/BP. Manila. \n29  ADB. 2003. Gender Checklist: Resettlement. Manila. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fResurgence  of  conflict.  High  unemployment  and  high  poverty  incidence  are \nheightening the potential for instability. The Government is pursuing a significant \nreform  agenda  and  has  made  progress  in  addressing  the  causes  and \nconsequences  of  the  2006  unrest.  Displaced  people  have  returned,  and  the \nGovernment  has  introduced  reforms  in  the  security  sector,  addressed  claims  of \ndiscrimination  raised  by  former  soldiers,  and  made  social  transfer  payments  to \nvulnerable  groups.  The  police  force  is  gradually  resuming  responsibility  for  law \nand order, while UN police and international forces continue to bolster security. \nLimited  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure.  MOI  has  both  human \nresource  and  budget  constraints.  The  budget  allocation  for  the  road  sector  in \n2009  is  only  about  $11  million,  making  the  6,000 km  road  network  severely \nunderinvested.  As  the  road  agency,  DRBFC  has  only  12  engineers.  The  PMU \nunder  MOI  will  therefore  be  maintained  and  strengthened  to  oversee  and \nadminister  day-to-day  matters.  ADB  is  also  implementing  TA  to  strengthen \nproject management capacity and improve budget execution. \nLack  of  road  maintenance  financing.  DRBFC  used  to  rely  on  a  road \nmaintenance  management  system  developed  under  a  JICA  TA  project  for  road \nmaintenance  planning,  but  there  has  always  been  a  shortage  of  human \nresources and funds for planned road maintenance. The Government has given \nits  assurance  that  it  will  gradually  increase  its  road  maintenance  funding.  The \nProject will support the maintenance of national roads in the border region. \nDeficiencies  in  border  management.  How  well  the  border  management \nagencies, such as the Joint Border Committee, perform will determine the extent \nto  which  the  benefits  of  road  improvement  reach  across  borders  and  sustain \nsubregional cooperation and integration. A regional TA project is being prepared \nby ADB to help strengthen the institutional capacity of the governments of Papua \nNew Guinea and Timor-Leste in cross-border matters with Indonesia. \nInadequate  capacity  of  national  contractors.  To  attract \ninternational \ncontractors, road rehabilitation contracts will be designed in larger packages, and \nmost  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  Joint  ventures  between \ninternational  and  national  contractors  will  be  encouraged  through  consultations \nand pre-bidding workshops. Most of the contract packages for road maintenance \nare  expected  to  be  small,  and  NCB  procedures  will  be  used  to  encourage \nnational  contractors  to  participate.  Small  contractors  will  be  trained  in  road \nmaintenance technology, bidding and contracting, and project management. \nLack  of  legal  authority  for  rights-of-way.  Road sector development in Timor-\nLeste  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of  a  law  for  securing  right-of-way.  Although  no \nland  is  expected  to  be  acquired  for  the  Project,  a  resettlement  framework  for \nunforeseen resettlement and land acquisition has been prepared. \n\n(vii)  Climate  change.  There  are  inherent  uncertainties  in  predicting  future  climate \nchange,  particularly  for  a  \u201cdata-poor\u201d  country  like  Timor-Leste.  It  is  therefore \nassumed that building capacity to manage current climate variability, with some \nforward-looking  predictions,  will  also  build  capacity  to  understand  and  manage \nongoing  and  longer-term  climate  change.  Moreover,  adaptation  options  with \nother important benefits, such as erosion control, will be emphasized as a way of \nreducing the risk of inappropriate investments. \n\n \n71. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOI  have  given  the \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nSubproject  selection.  Subprojects will be selected from the medium-term road \nnetwork development program. Prior to the detailed design of any subproject, the \nGovernment will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for \nfinancing under the Project, based on the agreed appraisal and eligibility criteria. \nProject management unit. Within 3 months of the grant effectiveness date, the \nGovernment,  through  MOI,  and  assisted  by  ADB  in  consultant  selection,  will \nrecruit  required  consultants  to  ensure  the  PMU  capacity  for  sector  project \nimplementation. At the completion of the Project, the national staff of PMU will be \noffered to join MOI as a regular staff. \nRoad safety. The Government will ensure that MOI (a) installs appropriate road \nsafety  facilities  during  project  implementation,  including  pavement  markings, \ntraffic signs and signals, warning signs, and hazard barriers; and (b) implements \nroad safety awareness programs in roadside communities. \nRoad  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  its  budget  allocation  for \nnational  and  district  roads  is  increased  to  at  least  $4 million  for  FY2010,  and \nincreased  by  at  least  30%  per  annum  in  each  subsequent  year  till  the  road \nmaintenance needs are fully satisfied.  \nProject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  MOI,  assisted  by  the \nconsultants engaged under the Project, will monitor and evaluate project impact. \nThe  Government  will  agree  with  ADB  on  the  indicators  and  baseline  data \nprepared by these consultants prior to the commencement of civil works, and will \nensure  that  the  consultants  monitor  and  compare  the  data  during  project \nimplementation and at project completion. To the extent possible, the indicators \nand baseline data will make use of gender-disaggregated data and information. \nCounterpart funding.  The Government will ensure that all funds and resources \nnecessary  for  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Project  are \nprovided in a timely manner. The Government will take all necessary measures, \nincluding  the  provision  of  additional  funds,  to  ensure  that  the  Project  is \nsuccessfully \nis \ncompleted. The Government will also ensure MOI maintains counterpart DRBFC \nstaffing and support its operations related to the Project. \nEnvironment.  No  subproject  assessed  as  category  A  (significant  adverse \nimpact) will be approved under the Project. The Government and MOI will ensure \nthat  (a) the  project  implementation  complies  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of Timor-Leste and ADB; (b) the EMP is updated, as required, during \nfinal  design;  (c) ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  IEE  and  EMP  is  obtained  before  issuing \nbidding documents for civil works. \n\nimplemented,  managed,  and  operated  after  construction \n\n(viii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. The Government and MOI will ensure that \nall  civil  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  rights-of-way.  In  the  event  of  any \nunforeseen  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the  Government  will  inform \nADB and prepare and implement a resettlement plan. The Government, through \nMOI,  will  ensure  that  (a) the  resettlement  plan  complies  with  all  applicable  laws \nand  regulations  of  the  Government  and  ADB;  (b) the  resettlement  plan  is \nupdated, as appropriate, during final design; (c) civil works do not start until the \nresettlement  plan  has  been  approved  by  ADB;  and  (d) civil  works  commence \nonly after land acquisition has been completed. \nGender  and  development.  The  MOI  will  (a) encourage  contractors  to  employ \n30% of women in civil works, and (b) provide equal pay to men and women for \nwork of equal type. \n\n(ix) \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fEthnic  minorities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  have \nany adverse impact on the livelihood of ethnic minorities living in the project area. \nIn  the  event  of  any  unforeseen  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  ethnic  minorities, \n(a) the  Government  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  plan  according  to  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Government and ADB; and (b) civil works \nwill not start until ADB has approved the plan. \nHealth risks. MOI will ensure that all civil works contracts include a requirement \nto  conduct  an  information  and  education  campaign  on  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases  (STDs),  including  HIV/AIDS,  for  construction  workers  as  part  of  the \nhealth  and  safety  program  at  construction  campsites.  In  addition,  the  MOI  will \nensure  that  similar  information  on  the  risk  of  transmission  of  STDs,  including \nHIV/AIDS,  is  disseminated  at  the  worksites  and  to  local  communities  in  the \ncorridor of influence, in coordination with national agencies working on this issue. \nMOI, through the PMU, will strictly monitor compliance. \nLabor  laws.  The  Government,  through  the  MOI,  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors comply with all applicable labor laws and related international treaty \nobligations, and do not employ child labor. \n\n(xiii)  Auditing.  The  Government  will  cause  MOI  to undertake  timely  audit  of  project \naccounts  according  to  sound  auditing  standards  by  an  external  auditor \nacceptable to ADB. \n\n(xiv)  Governance.

It is located at the eastern end of \nthe  Sunda  archipelago  and  has  a  dramatic  topography  dominated  by  Mount  Ramelau,  which \nbisects  the  island  from  east  to  west.  About  44%  of  the  land  area  has  an  elevation  of  100\u2013\n500 meters  (m),  and  35%  above  1,000 m,  making  road  building  expensive  and  road \nmaintenance difficult.1   \n \n2. \nIn Timor-Leste, roads play a vital role in economic development and country integration. \nAs  the  primary  mode  of  transport,  roads  carry  about  70%  of  freight  and  90%  of  passengers. \nTimor-Leste  has  an  extensive  road  network  of  about  6,000  km;  half  of  the  roads  are \nundeveloped  rural  tracks.  According  to  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  the  core  network \ncomprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. The national road network, \nlinking  the  13  districts,  comprises  two  (northern  and  southern)  coastal  roads  and  five  roads \ntraversing north\u2013south connecting the two coastal roads. The district roads link major population \ncenters to the national roads. The core network is supplemented by 716 km of urban roads in \nDili  and  several  smaller  towns  and  cities,  and  more  than  3,000  km  of  rural  roads  providing \naccess to villages and more remote areas with agricultural potential. \n \nThe  road  network  was  constructed  under  relatively  low  standards  of  design  and \n3. \nmaterials  adapting  to  the  often-severe  terrain  conditions.  Although  about  80%  (1,800  km)  of \ncore roads used to be sealed, the roads were constructed with two standard narrow pavement \nwidths\u20143.2 m  and  4.5 m.  Even  such  road  widths  have  often  been  compromised  by  actual \nterrain  conditions,  resulting  in  many  very  narrow  roads.  In  mountainous  regions,  the  poor \nhorizontal or vertical alignments of roads limit the traveler\u2019s sight distance, and pose additional \ndanger to traffic. The rural roads that provide access to villages and communities and connect \nto the core network are mostly undeveloped tracks. \n \n\nRoad Condition \n\n2. \n \n4. \nAlmost  the  whole  core  road  network  needs  rehabilitation  to  restore  the  network  to  a \nmaintainable condition. The roads have prematurely deteriorated because of lack of routine and \npreventive  maintenance.  The  deterioration  has  been  compounded  by  intense  rainfall  and \ngeotechnical instability in mountainous areas causing frequent landslides. According to a road \ncondition  survey  of  the  core  network  in  early  2009,  almost  the  entire  road  network  has \ndeteriorated and is no longer maintainable.2 As shown in Table A2.1, only about 8% of the core \nroads are in fair condition, about 22% in poor condition, and about 70% in very poor condition.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2004.

Technical Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Timor-\nLeste for  Preparing the Road Network Development Project. Manila.  \n \n3. \n \n5. \nTransport  demand  and  vehicle  ownership  in  Timor-Leste  are  modest.  However,  both \nhave  been  growing  substantially  over  the  last  5  years,  particularly  where  motorcycles  are \nconcerned.  Average  annual  growth  of  motorized  vehicles  in  2004\u20132008  was  8.5%  excluding \nmotorcycles,  and  16.2%  including  motorcycles.  The  traffic  volume  is  concentrated  on  the \nnorthern east\u2013west axis, linking Dili and other district centers along the coast. Other than a few \nkey north\u2013south links, the traffic volume in the southern regions is low. Traffic counts conducted \non the core network in early 2009 indicated that the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles \non national roads is about 215 excluding motorcycles (about 476 including motorcycles), and on \nnational roads about 42 excluding motorcycles (103 including motorcycles). The heaviest traffic \nflows,  in  excess  of  1,000  vehicles  per  day  excluding  motorcycles,  are  on  the  northern  coastal \nroad. \n \n6. \nThe nationwide classified traffic counts in 2005 and 2009 indicated that traffic volumes \nincreased significantly over the 4-year period. Motorcycles are now the dominant road vehicles, \nand their use and predominance over other vehicle types continues to grow. Private cars, jeeps, \nfour-wheel drives, pickups, and minibuses are other important groups of road users with rapid \nannual growth rates of more than 15%. The use of large buses has been declining because the \nnarrow, winding mountainous roads are hardly passable. Table A2.2 compares the vehicle fleet \nin 2005 and 2009.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Vehicle Fleet \n\nVehicle Type \nMotorcycles \nPrivate cars, taxis, jeeps, and 4WD \nPickups, vans, and minibuses \nMedium and large buses \nLight and medium trucks \nHeavy and specialized trucks \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nEstimated Total \nNumber in 2005 \n\nEstimated Total \nNumber in 2009 \n\n11,012 \n5,414 \n3,303 \n200 \n2,167 \n61 \n22,157 \n\n32,305 \n15,539 \n3,123 \n155 \n2,127 \n89 \n44,323 \n\n \n7. \nWeather and coffee production are two major factors affecting traffic. The rainy season \nhas  a  direct  impact  on  traffic  patterns.  The  duration  of  the  rainy  season  can  vary  in  different \nareas of the country, between an average of 4 months (from December to March) and 8 months \n(from  November  to  June).  Landslides  and  flooding,  which  are  common  during  that  season, \ncause frequent road closures. Another factor affecting traffic patterns over the year is the coffee \nproduction  and  harvesting  cycle.  Five  coffee-growing  centers  are  concentrated  in  the  western \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\narea of Timor-Leste. The coffee is picked up by small trucks and first brought to wet factories for \nprocessing,  then  sent  to  other  factories  for  drying,  and  finally  to  Dili  for  final  processing  and \nshipping.  The  coffee  harvest  season  peaks  between  August  and  September.  During  that \nseason, light and medium truck traffic in the coffee-growing areas and between those areas and \nDili increase significantly. \n \n\nTransport Services \n\n4. \n \nTransport  services  in  Timor-Leste,  both  for  passengers  and  for  goods,  are  provided \n8. \ncompetitively  by  the  private  sector.  There  is  only  minimal  interference  from  the  Government, \nexcept  for  licensing  and  basic  vehicle  and  road  safety  requirements.  In  the  urban  areas, \npassenger services are largely provided by minibuses (and to a much lesser extent, in Dili, also \nby  taxicabs).  In  the  rural  areas,  particularly  where  road  conditions  are  difficult,  passenger \nservices  are  also  provided  by  minibuses,  and  by  light  and  medium  trucks  where  passengers \nstand or sit on the flatbed. The multipurpose light and medium trucks are licensed to carry both \npassengers  and  freight.  Finally,  a  small  number  of  heavy  trucks,  about  90  in  total,  mainly \ntransport containers and large equipment, but are limited in area coverage by the narrow road \nwidths and difficult terrain. \n \n9. \nCurrently,  land  transport  services  between  the  Timor-Leste  mainland  and  the  Oecussi \nexclave  are  complicated.  All  people  crossing  the  border  through  Indonesian  West  Timor  are \nrequired to have passports with valid Indonesian visas, which can be obtained only in Dili. Thus, \nthe  number  of  people  and  vehicles  crossing  is  still  low  at  present  although  it  is  increasing.  A \nferry  operates  between  Dili  and  Oecussi  twice  a  week,  as  an  alternative  to  the  difficult \nland crossing. It has a capacity of about 300 passengers and 170 tons of freight. \n \n\nRegulations and Specifications \n\n5. \n \nIn  the  road  sector,  the  Government  has  established  much  of  the  essential  framework, \n10. \nincluding  institutions  and  laws.  The  development  and  management  of  roads  is  one  of  the \nseveral  tasks  for  which  the  MOI  is  responsible.  The  Directorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood \nControl  (DRBFC)  under  MOI  plans,  implements,  and  manages  the  development  of  road \ninfrastructure.  DRBFC  is  also  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  road \nnetwork. It operates through five regional offices (in Baucau, Dili, Maliana, Oecussi, and Same) \ncovering the entire road network. \n \nIn 2003, the Government introduced two laws to regulate and manage the road sector: \n11. \n(i) the  Basic  Law  for  Vehicle  Transport,  and  (ii) the  Road  Code.  The  former  covers  rules  and \nregulations for vehicle registration, road charges, passenger and freight transport services and \npassenger fares, and the planning and coordination of public infrastructure provision. The Road \nCode  covers  traffic  rules,  traffic  management,  the  classification  and  use  of  roads,  vehicle \ncategorization, fines, vehicle emissions, accident reporting, and licensing of drivers. In 2008, the \nMOI,  with  assistance  from  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  developed  several \nguidelines  (pavement  guidelines,  concrete  guidelines,  slope  protection  guidelines,  and  a \nconcrete and aggregate testing manual). \n \nB. \n \nPoor  condition  of  the  core  road  network.  Although  the  road  assets  inherited  at \n12. \nindependence in 2002 were essentially complete, they were damaged in the conflict period and \nare  rapidly  deteriorating  because  of  the  difficult  terrain,  geology,  torrential  rains,  low  design \n\nKey Challenges \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nstandards, and neglect of maintenance. The poor road infrastructure hampers people\u2019s access \nto economic and social services, and the development of industry and agriculture. \n \n13.  Weak  planning  and  implementation  capacity.  The DRBFC is seriously handicapped \nby shortage of technical staff.3 This has affected its operational capacity for strategic planning, \nprocurement and administration of new infrastructure contracts, and timely maintenance of the \nroad network. MOI is keen to expand its capacity by hiring more staff, but it is constrained by the \nlimited availability of skilled human resources and better incentives offered by the private sector. \n \n14. \nInsufficient  road  maintenance  finance  and  practices.  The  road  network  lacks  a \nwell-planned routine and periodic maintenance program. The annual maintenance expenditure \nneeds for national roads are estimated at $20\u2013$30 million. However, the Government allocated \nonly about $3.7 million in 2009 for the maintenance of all categories of roads. DRBFC does not \nhave  a  functioning  system  for  setting  performance  targets  and  for  planning  and  programming \nperiodic  road  maintenance  activities.  Most  road  works    on  the  core  road  network  are \nimplemented  reactively  by  the  local  communities,  through  DRBFC,  but  supervisory  guidance \nhas not been provided sufficiently and on time, leaving the quality of the works in question. \n \n15. \nDifficult  terrain,  geology,  and  weather  conditions.  Terrain,  geology,  and  weather \nconditions  considerably  increase  the  cost  of  providing  and  maintaining  roads.  Mountain  roads \nare prone to erosion and landslides in the rainy season, while coastal plain roads, especially in \nthe  south,  are  prone  to  flooding.  During  the  8-month  rainy  season  from  November  to  June,  a \nlarge  part  of  the  road  network,  including  large  sections  of  the  national  road  network  and  a \nnumber of district roads, becomes impassable after heavy rains. \n \n16. \nindustry.  Private  companies  have \nimplemented road projects in Timor-Leste, but they are not ready to undertake large-scale road \nprojects  independently.  The  main  capacity  constraints  of  these  contractors  are  financial \nresources and technical and managerial skills. Most of the consulting work for large projects is \nperformed  by  foreign  companies  since  the  capacity  of  local  consulting  firms  is  still \nunderdeveloped.  \n \nRight-of-way.  The  legal  foundation  for  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  for  roads  has  not  been \n17. \nestablished in Timor-Leste. When roadworks require additional land, the Government negotiates \nwith the owners or users on a case-to-case basis. Previously, when land had to be acquired for \ncivil works, the concerned parties negotiated under the direction of local authorities and reached \nagreement regarding compensation rates, the total compensation amount, and the procedures \nfor  compensation  and  cash  transfer.  There  are  no  specific  laws  or  guidelines  concerning  land \nacquisition and compensation. The first land law of Timor-Leste (Law No.1/2003) was passed in \nMarch  2003  but  does  not  provide  a  legal  basis  for  declaring  customary  land  to  be  public  land \nbelonging  to  the  state.  A  new  land  law  being  prepared  by  the  Government  is  expected  to \naddress these issues. \n \n18. \nRoad  safety.  Data  on  road  accidents  are  scarce  and  incomplete.  Reports  on  road \naccidents  seem  to  substantially  underestimate  the  actual  number  of  road  accidents.  This  is \nexplained  in  part  by  the  fact  that  Timor-Leste  does  not  require  car  or  driver  insurance.  Thus, \nroad  accidents  that  do  not  result  in  injuries  are  settled  between  the  involved  parties,  and  not \nreported to the police. The Timor-Leste National Police reported that in 2008 there were 1,656 \nroad accidents; of these, 50 accidents resulted in fatalities, 215 in serious injuries, and 1,020 in \n\nLimited  capacity  of  national  contracting \n\n                                                 \n3   DRBFC has only 12 engineers\u2014seven at the headquarters in Dili and five in the regional offices.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nother  injuries.  Many  less-serious,  unreported  cases  were  not  included.  The  actual  number  of \ninjuries  and  fatalities  is  deemed  to  be  much  higher.  Accidents  are  mostly  attributed  to  human \nerror  (60%  of  all  reported  accidents),  road  conditions  (25%),  weather  conditions  (10%),  and \nmechanical  failure  (5%).  The  potential  for  even-higher  accident  rates  is  great,  considering  the \nincreased  number  of  vehicles,  many  of  which  are  unprotected  motorcycles  carrying  up  to  four \npeople,  and  the  increased  vehicle  speeds  made  possible  by  economic  growth  and  road \nimprovements. \n \nC. \n \nThe  Government  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  current  National  Development  Plan, 4  released  in \n19. \n2002, places high importance on infrastructure development. The objectives for roads, bridges, \nand flood control are \n \n\nGovernment Strategy and Vision \n\ntopologies  of \n\nidentifying the national, district, and rural road networks essential for the support \nof economic and social development; \ninitiating policies within a legal and regulatory framework to improve the quality of \nlife, encourage private enterprise, and improve access and safety particularly in \nimpoverished areas; \ndeveloping  roads,  bridges,  and \nflood  control \nenvironmental protection and reverse existing ecological damage; \nensuring development and regulation for the safe circulation of transport; \nensuring  transport  infrastructure  meets  national  defense  imperatives,  and \nestablishing technical standards for a national road network; \npreserving road assets as the first priority through sustainable maintenance and \nlong-term management plans for support systems; \nestablishing  an \ntechnical  and \nadministrative capacity of East Timorese staff to manage, maintain, and improve \nthe road network; \nimplementing sustainable strategies for maintaining rural access roads; and \nestablishing  and  implementing  erosion  control  measures  to  prevent  damage  to \nphysical infrastructure and economically valuable property. \n\ninstitutional  structure  and  developing \n\nthat  provide \n\nthe \n\n \n20. \nThe  transport  sector  is currently  faced  with  managing  a  degraded  road  network,  which \nentails a very high cost for the reactive work needed to keep it functioning.

The  approach  allows  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste  to  take \nthe lead in identifying, prioritizing, appraising, designing, and implementing subprojects. As the \nExecuting Agency for the Project, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) will propose, on behalf of \nthe  Government,  the  rehabilitation  of  priority  road  links  as  subprojects  for  the  approval  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  approval  of  subprojects  will  be  based  on  satisfactory \ntechnical, economic, social, and environmental assessments against eligibility criteria agreed on \nbetween the Government and ADB.  \n \n2. \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria  given  here  apply  only  to  the  road  rehabilitation \ncomponent.  Other  components  of  the  Project  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  standard \nprocedures for ADB-funded projects. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe selection of subprojects will be guided, first of all, by the medium-term road network \ndevelopment  program.1 The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  select  candidate  subprojects \nand  undertake  stakeholder  consultations  to  investigate  the  relevance  of  the  subprojects  to \n(i) fostering economic development, (ii) improving the quality of life of residents, (iii) serving rural \nand  remote  areas,  (iv) fostering  regional  development  within  the  country,  and  (v) creating \nemployment.2   \n \n4. \nsubprojects must meet the following eligibility criteria for funding under the Project: \n \n\nPMU  will  shortlist  the  candidate  subprojects  that  satisfy  the  five  criteria.  The  candidate \n\nSubproject Eligibility Criteria \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEconomic  efficiency.  The  subprojects  must  be  economically  viable,  and  must \ndemonstrate an economic internal rate of return of at least 12%. The  economic \nanalysis  should  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.3 As a bottom line, the subproject will be assessed \nfor  its  contribution  to:  (a) savings  in  travel  time,  (b)  reduced  vehicle  operation \ncosts, (c) potential for increased agricultural production and marketing due to low \nfreight costs and more reliable access, (d) employment of local communities and \nnational  contractors  for  civil  works,  (e) increased  incomes  particularly  among \npoor and rural households, and (f) risk mitigation benefits due to climate change \nadaptation measures. \nEnvironment  impact.  Subproject  environmental  selection  criteria  will  exclude \nsubprojects  that  are  likely  to  cause  major  environmental  impact  (environmental \ncategory  A),  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  Environmental \nscreening  will  be  conducted  for  all  subprojects.  In  selecting  subproject  sites, \nincluding  extraction  sites  for  materials  to  be  brought  into  the  construction  sites, \nthe following environmental criteria will be used for the first level of screening. If \nany of these selection criteria are found applicable to the site, then the subproject \n\n                                                 \n1  The program is subject to regular review and revision by the Government. \n2  The five criteria were identified by the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste in October 2008 for the National Infrastructure \n\nPlan. \n\n3   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n32  \n \n\nwill  not  be  approved  as  part  of  the  Project.  Subprojects  approved  for  funding \nunder  the  Project  must  not  (a) be  classified  as  category A  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003); (b) result in significant loss \nof  or  damage  to  natural  environments,  such  as  forests,  reefs,  mangroves,  or \nother  sensitive  areas;  (c) have  a  permanent  negative  effect  on  a  known  rare  or \nendangered  species;  or  (d) cause  permanent  damage  to  irreplaceable  cultural \nrelics and archaeological sites. \nLand acquisition and resettlement. No subproject that requires land acquisition \nwith significant resettlement impact, according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995),  will  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the  Project.  The  inclusion  of  a \ncandidate  road  as  a  subproject  for  funding  under  the  Project  is  therefore \ncontingent  on  compliance  with  agreed  eligibility  criteria.  With  respect  to \nminimizing  land  acquisition  (no  permanent  and  only  minimal  temporary  use  of \nland) and its impact, the criteria are as follows: (i) rehabilitation should require no \nland  acquisition  and  no  major  earthworks  or  construction  of  structures;  (ii) the \ninclusion  of  the  road  has  local  support;  (iii) the  proposed  works  avoid  the \ndisplacement  of  residential  structures  or  other,  permanent,  structures;  (iv) the \nroad  is  located  on  state-owned  land  or  there  is  a  negotiated  agreement  with \naffected  owners  and  communities  to  use  customary  land;  and  (v) there  is  no \nother significant adverse environmental or social impact. \nCounterpart  funds. MOI will confirm that all funds and resources necessary for \nthe  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  subproject  are  provided  on \ntime. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nCandidate Project Roads \n\nC. \n \n5. \nAppendix A, the candidate project roads are as follows: \n \n\nAccording  to  the  medium-term  road  network  development  program  in  Supplementary \n\nTable A4: Candidate Project Roads \n \n\nRoad Link \nA02-07 \nA03-03/04 \nA04-01 \nA04-02 \nA11-01 \nA19-01 \n\nTo \nFrom \nSuai \nZumulai \nMota Ain \nLiquica \nGleno \nTibar \nGleno \nErmera \nA04 Junction (Ermera)  Maliana \nSakato \nPante Macassar \n\nLength (km) \n29.8 \n78.8 \n33.3 \n11.5 \n63.9 \n15.0 \n\nSource:  The  medium-term  road  network  development  program  prepared  under  ADB. \n2008.

Manila.  \n\n \n6. \nOn  the  basis  of  consultations  with  the  Government  and  key  stakeholders,  two  road \nlinks\u2014(i) Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota Ain, and (ii) Ermera\u2013Maliana\u2014were selected as samples for \nsubproject  appraisal.  (The  feasibility  studies  for  these  two  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendixes  B\u2013G.)  The  road  from  Liquica  to  Mota  Ain  is  on  national  roads  linking  Dili  and  the \nlargest border crossing, at Mota Ain. Another road from Ermera to Maliana provides access to \ncoffee  farmers  and  processors  transporting  coffee,  the  country\u2019s  most  important  commercial \nagriculture product, to the market. The rehabilitation works will restore the roads on both links to \nmaintainable conditions. All civil works will be carried out within the road alignments to minimize \nthe adverse impact on nearby communities and the environment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \n \n\nSubproject Selection Procedure \n\nFigure A4 outlines the subproject selection procedure. \n\nFigure A4: Subproject Selection Procedure \n \n\nPMU: Stakeholders Consultation for Candidate Subprojects\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nMOI: Endorsement of Candidate Subprojects\n\nPMU: Subproject Appraisal\n\nMOI: Endorsement of Subproject Appraisal\n\nADB: Approval of Subprojects\n\nPMU: Subproject Detailed Design and Implementation\n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  MOI  =  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n8. \nThe  PMU  will  conduct  stakeholder  consultations  on  behalf  of  MOI,  and  report  on  the \nresults  and  propose  subprojects  for  appraisal  to  the  MOI.  The  minister  of  MOI  will  endorse \ncandidate subprojects for appraisal. \n \n9. \nWith  MOI\u2019s  endorsement  of  candidate  subprojects,  the  PMU,  assisted  by  the  project \nimplementation  support  consultants,  will  undertake  the  required  appraisal  to  justify  subproject \neligibility. The appraisal will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to assess feasibility \nand  expected  impact,  using  methods  and  tools  established  for  the  sample  subprojects.  Each \nsubproject  appraisal  will  cover  (i) a  technical  feasibility  study,  (ii) an  economic  analysis  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,  (iii) a  social  and \npoverty analysis in accordance with the method and procedure used in the sample subproject \nfeasibility  study,  and  (iv) an  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental  management \nplan  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  used  in  the \nsample subproject feasibility study. Each component of the assessment will confirm acceptable \nratings against the criteria, or recommend further works to complete the assessment. \n \n10.  MOI  will  review  the  appraisal  report  and  endorse  the  subproject  that  meets  all  the \neligibility  criteria.  The  subproject  appraisal  report  with  the  endorsement  of  the  minister  of  MOI \nwill then be submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n11. \nADB will review the appraisal report and, if necessary, may request additional materials \nand  studies  to  justify  the  subproject.  ADB\u2019s  formal  approval  has  to  be  obtained  before  the \ndetailed design of any subproject, and its inclusion for financing under the Project. With ADB\u2019s \napproval, the PMU will start subproject detailed design and implementation. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n34  \n \n\nROAD MAINTENANCE PROGRAM \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nRoad  is  the  primary  mode  of  transport,  which  carries  70%  of  freight  and  90%  of \n1. \npassengers.  Timor-Leste  has  an  extensive  road  network  of  about  6,000  km,  half  of  which  are \ncurrently undeveloped rural tracks. The core road network comprises 1,400 km of national roads \nconnecting the 13 districts and 900 km of district roads linking major population centers to the \nnational  roads.  The  road  conditions  of  the  core  road  network  demonstrate  premature \ndeterioration. Almost the whole network needs rehabilitation works to restore the road condition \nto maintainable levels. \n \nLack  of  road  maintenance,  severe  climate  environment,  and  unstable  geotechnical \n2. \nconditions  are  the  primary  reasons  for  the  premature  deterioration  of  road  network  in  Timor-\nLeste.  Routine  maintenance  could  efficiently  protect  road  assets  through  timely  clearing \ndrainage  and  small  landslips,  regularly  removing  vegetation,  and  repairing  pavement  surface \ndistresses  at  early  stages.  Periodic  maintenance  to  reinstate  road  surface  damage  by  traffic \nabrasion and wet season erosion could help postpone the needs of rehabilitation. The unstable \ngeotechnical  conditions  and  severe  climate  environment  also  contribute  to  the  poor  road \nconditions,  but  their  impact  would  have  been  significantly  alleviated  if  proper  maintenance  is \nundertaken.  \n \n3. \nInsufficient budget allocation and weak executive capacity are the two main constraints \nto  keeping  the  road  network  in  a  maintainable  condition.  The  needs  of  annual  maintenance \nexpenditure  for  national  and  major  district  roads  are  estimated  at  $20  million  \u2013  $30  million. \nHowever,  the  budget  for  the  maintenance  works  for  all  categories  of  roads  is  only  about \n$4.8 million in 2009. The directorate of roads, bridges and floods control (DRBFC) of Ministry of \nInfrastructure  (MOI)  is  responsible  for  developing  and  managing  roads,  but  seriously \nhandicapped by shortage of technical staff; it only has 12 engineers, seven in the headquarters \nin Dili and five in regional offices. \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nThe Road Network Development Sector Project will support the MOI to establish a road \nmaintenance  program  (RMP).  The  RMP  will  firstly  be  implemented  in  three  pilot  districts, \nBobonaro,  Covalima,  and  Oecussi,  which  are  all  located  at  the  border  to  Indonesian  West \nTimor. The connectivity in border region is of strategic importance as it provides access for most \ncross-border  activities  between  Timor-Leste  and  Indonesia,  including  trade,  travel,  and  family \nreunion.1   \n \nTimely and adequate road maintenance will proactively protect the roads from premature \n5. \ndeterioration,  and  effectively  reduce  road  closure  caused  by  heavy  rainfall  during  the  wet \nseason.  Providing  all-season  access  to  the  rural  areas  also  means  the  social  and  health \nservices will not be interrupted and commercial activities will be facilitated. \n \n6. \nEstablishing an RMP will benefit the country through job creation. About 16,000 young \npeople join the country\u2019s workforce every year, while in rural areas many people are essentially \n\nRoad Maintenance Program \n\n                                                 \n1   As  Timor-Leste  expects  to  join  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  in  2012,  the  opportunities  for \n\ncooperation with Indonesia will be increased significantly. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nin  chronic  underemployment.2 An  RMP  will  provide  business  opportunities  to  contractors  and \nthus  generate  sustainable  employment.  The  generated  jobs  will  be  further  increased  after  the \nGovernment takes over the RMP and expands it to all 13 districts. \n \nA  functioning  RMP  is  also  an  important  indicator  of  good  investment  environment  for \n7. \nroad  sector  since  it  could  protect  the  road  assets  from  premature  deterioration.  Development \npartners  are  usually  reluctant  to  provide  large-scale  assistance  to  the  road  sector  before  an \nRMP is functioning. More donors and development partners are expected to provide assistance \nto road sector development once the RMP is established. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nimplementation framework is in Table A5). \n \n\nDuring  project  implementation,  the  RMP  will  be  established  in  three  phases  (an \n\nImplementation \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPhase  1:  Program  establishment.  In the first year, an international consultant \nwill be engaged as the road maintenance advisor of the project management unit \n(PMU)  and  take  the  lead  in  developing  the  RMP  operation  manual,  developing \nand  conducting  a  training  program  for  small  contractors  and  DRBFC  staff,  and \nadministering the related consulting services and civil works. A road maintenance \nengineer (national consultant) of PMU and counterpart DRBFC staff will also be \ntrained on-the-job for planning and implementing the RMP.  \nPhase  2:  Pilot  implementation.  In  years  2\u20133,  the  road  maintenance  engineer \nwill take the lead in implementing the RMP in the three pilot districts. The RMP \noperation  manual  will  guide  the  activities  of  road  maintenance  engineer  and \ncounterpart  MOI  staff.  In  this  phase,  counterpart  DRBFC  staff  are  expected  to \nassume  responsibility  of  specific \nthe  supervision  of  road \nmaintenance engineer. \nPhase  3:  Transition  and  expansion.  In  years  4\u20135,  the  RMP  will  be  gradually \ntransferred to the responsibility of DRBFC. In this phase, (i) the DRBFC staff will \ntake  the  lead  in  administering  the  RMP  implementation  in  the  pilot  region,  (ii) \nPMU  will  provide  support,  mainly  through  the  road  maintenance  engineer,  to \nDRBFC, and (iii) PMU is also responsible for preparing a strategy to expand the \nRMP  to  nationwide  core  road  network,  and  propose  related  institutional  setup \nand  financing  requirement.  MOI  will  review  the  expansion  strategy,  approve  it, \nand reflect it in its annual budget planning.  \n\ntasks  under \n\n \n9. \nThe  training  program  for  small  contractors  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  before  the \nbidding procedure.

The  key  objectives  of  the  linked  JFPR  project  are  to  (i)  extend \nsocioeconomic  benefits  of  the  Road  Network  Development  Sector  Project  to  roadside \ncommunities,  and  (ii)  develop  sustainable  community  participation  model  in  community \ninfrastructure  work  with  the  local  government.  Its  Project  areas  are  the  districts  of  Bobonaro, \nCovalima,  and  Oecussi.  Those  districts  were  selected  from  (i)  the  project  areas  of  the  Road \nNetwork  Development  Sector  Project,  and  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  pilot  districts  of  the  local \ndevelopment program. \n \n2. \nThe duration of the linked JFPR project will be 48 months. The Executing Agency will be \nthe  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI).  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  under  MOI  will  hire \nconsulting firms, NGOs, and consultants to implement the Project. The linked JFPR project has \nthe following four components. \n \nA. \n\nImproved Quality of Community-Based Infrastructure Work through Rural \nCommunity Roads and Rehabilitation and Maintenance  \n\n \n3. \nThis  component  will  support  community  participation  in  rural  feeder  roadworks  and \nsmall-scale  community  infrastructure,  and  capacity  development  of  community  workers  for \nbasic  infrastructure  works.  It  will  take  a  community  and  local  government  participatory \napproach to select sites, workers, designs, and methods for rural roadworks, small community \ninfrastructure upgrading and rehabilitations.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThis  component  will  support  skills  development  for  rural  poor  and  vulnerable  groups \n(including  poor  household,  disadvantaged  women,  unemployed  youth)  through  literacy, \nnumeracy,  basic  business  skills  training,  and  raising  community  awareness  through  life  skills \nprogram on road safety, primary health care, and gender.  \n \nC. \n\nSkills Development and Community Awareness-Building in Rural Communities  \n\nSupport to Selected Local Government Units for the Rehabilitation and Routine \nMaintenance of Rural and Feeder Roads  \n\n \n5. \nThis component will support the pilot implementation to support local government units \nfor rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder roads in three districts: Covalima, Bobonaro, \nand  Oecussi.  Covalima  and  Bobonaro  are  part  of  the  local  development  program  and  have \nadministrative staff in place.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nother three components.  \n \n\nThis component will support the project management, monitoring, and evaluation of the \n\nProject Management, Monitoring and Audit  \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n(By Expenditure Category and By Financier) \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\nForeign \n\n( $ million) \nLocal \n\nExchange  Currency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n  \n% of Total \nBase Cost \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\na.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  signed  a  poverty  reduction  partnership  in  October  2003.  The  Government\u2019s  National \nDevelopment  Plan  incorporates  a  poverty  reduction  strategy  focusing  on  (i)  promoting  opportunities  for  the  poor; \n(ii) improving  their  access  to  basic  social  services;  (iii)  enhancing  security,  including  reducing  vulnerability  to  shocks, \nand  improving  food  security;  and  (iv)  empowering  the  poor.  The  2005\u22122006  country  strategy  and  program  update \n(CSPU)  notes  that  pervasive  poverty  and  slow  social  development  require  a  focus  on  development  that  will  directly \nbenefit the poor.a The country operations business plan 2008\u20132010 concluded that assistance provided by ADB over \nthe  preceding  period  (2006\u20132008)  supported  the  Government  in  moving  toward  four  specific  National  Development \nPlan  goals,  including  provision  of  roads  and  bridges  for  the  movement  of  people  and  goods,  orderly  and  efficient \nfunctioning of markets, and sustainable development.b The Project  will continue to provide support to this goal of the \nNational Development Plan by upgrading, rehabilitating and establishing a strategy for maintenance of 32 priority road \nlinks  located  across  11  of  the  13  districts  (the  two  districts  without  road  sections  among  the  32  priority  links  include \nManufahi and Viqueque). The Project will commence with three road links\u2014A03-03 Liquica\u2013Batugade (74.3 km), A03-\n04  Batugade\u2013Mota  Ain  (2.6  km)  and  A11-01  Ermera\u2013Maliana  (63.9 km)\u2014as  sample  subprojects.  Links  A03-03  and \nA03-04  are  located  in  Liquica  and  Bobonaro  districts  and  link  A11-01  is  located  in  Bobonaro  and  Ermera  districts. \nUsing  the  same  division  of  districts  as  the  Timor-Leste  survey  of  living  standards  (TLSLS),  i.e.,  (i)  east  includes \nBaucau,  Lautem  and  Viqueque;  (ii)  center  includes  Alieu,  Ainaro,  Dili,  Ermera,  Liquica,  Manufahi  and  Manututo;  and \n(iii) west includes Bobonaro, Cova Lima and Oecussi, the distribution of the priority links is 49% in the center (covering \n88 sucos [villages]), 17% in the east (covering 30 sucos), and 34% in the west (covering 60 sucos). Combined, the 32 \npriority links will improve access for 178 sucos. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nBased  on  the  latest  TLSLS,  the  official  poverty  incidence,  is  derived  from  two  poverty  lines;  the  lower  poverty  line \n(food/extreme poverty line) is $0.71/person/day and the upper poverty line (minimum basic needs) is $0.88/person/day, \nhalf of the population falls below the upper poverty line and a third of the population falls below the lower poverty line \nThe characteristics of poverty include the following: \n(i)  Poverty  incidence  is  higher  in  rural  areas  (52%)  than  in  urban  areas  (45%),  and  with  three-quarters  of  the  poor \n\nliving in rural areas.  \n\n(ii)  Children  under  the  age  of  15  years  account  for  43%  of  the  population  but  account  for  49%  of  the  poor.  Young \nchildren (i.e., those aged 5 years or less) represent 19% of the total population but account for 21% of the poor. \n(iii) Those  with  no  or  only  low  levels  of  education  account  for  most  of  the  poor.  The  poverty  rate  for  people  without \n\neducation is 58%, with a primary education is 50%, and with a secondary education is 34%.  \n\n(iv) Controlling for household size, households headed by women are poorer than households headed by men. Overall, \npoverty incidence increases  with household size but for any household size the incidence of poverty is higher for \nhouseholds headed by women. \n\n(v)  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  the  central  districts  (which  includes  two  of  the  districts  in  the  sample  project  area\u2014\nErmera and Liquica). The incidence of poverty in the three districts in the sample project area range from 45% in \nLiquica to 55% in Ermera and Bobonaro. Together, these three districts account for 27.4% of the country\u2019s poor. \nThe household survey undertaken for the Project correlates well with the TLSLS data. Using the upper poverty line of \n$0.88/day/person,  some  59%  of  the  sample  subproject  area  is  poor  (compared  with  51%  in  TLSLS)  and  some  78% \nsuffer food shortages) compared with 79% in the TLSLS). Taking into account the rural nature of poverty, and that most \nof  the  poor  are  engaged  in  low-productivity  farming  (80%  of  the  total  poor  and  90%  of  the  rural  poor  depend  on  the \nagriculture sector), improving access to markets as well as increasing availability and diversity of farming inputs have \ncredible contributions to make to poverty reduction. At the national level, 64% of the poor, compared with 76% of the \nnon-poor,  have  access  to  all  weather  roads,  in  rural  areas  the  proportion  of  poor  with  access  to  all  weather  roads \ndecreases further to 58% (compared with 68% of the non-poor).  \nThe  poor  will  be  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  in  terms  of  improving  inferior  quality  roads  and  accessibility  in  all \nseasons,  as  well  as  potentially  reducing  travel  times  to  the  closest  all-weather  roads  for  those  sucos  and  aldeias \n(communities)  included in the linked project  Our Roads, Our Future\u2014Supporting Local  Governance and Community-\nBased  Infrastructure  Works,  which  is  proposed  to  be  funded  by  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR).  This  will \nsupport improvement of selected feeder roads in rural communities in project areas, as well as enhance involvement of \nthe communities in roadworks and small community infrastructure such as markets. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n2.  Design Features \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\nThe  Project  incorporates  several  strategies  to  facilitate  the  ability  of  households  and  communities  to  realize  benefits \nfrom  road  improvements  and  maintenance  and,  thereby,  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area  including  (i)  priorities  for \nemployment  of  local  men  and  women  for  both  civil  works  and  routine  road  maintenance,  particularly  for  poor \nhouseholds and those households affected by any minor resettlement impact; (ii) contractor specifications for provision \nof HIV/AIDS/STI awareness and prevention programs for construction crews and surrounding communities; (iii) a public \nconsultation  and  participation  program  linked  to  different  aspects  of  subproject  preparation  and  implementation \n(including  participation  in  monitoring),  to  be  undertaken  by  the  executing  agency  and  continue  the  consultation \ncommenced during the project preparatory TA; (iv) a JFPR project, refer below; and (v) a long-term participatory social \nmonitoring  study  to  track  benefits  among  different  road  user  groups  and  the  communities  participating  in  the  JFPR \nproject.  The  Project  includes  the  JFPR  project  (approximately  $3  million  with  Government  cofinancing)  to  continue  to \ntake community empowerment approach, which was commenced under the Road Sector Improvement Project (RSIP).c \nThe key objectives of the JFPR are (i) to extend the socioeconomic benefits of the Road Network Development Sector \nProject  to  roadside  communities,  and  (ii)  to  develop  a  model  for  sustainable  community  participation  in  community \ninfrastructure  work  with  the  local  government.  The  proposed  JFPR  project  locations  are  Bobonaro,  Covalima,  and \nOecussi. The Project will support (i) community participation in feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance and capacity \ndevelopment  of  community  workers  for  future  basic  community  infrastructure  works;  (ii)  skills  development  for  rural \npoor and vulnerable groupsd (including poor households, disadvantaged women, unemployed youth) through literacy, \nnumeracy,  basic  business  skills  (agriculture  and  horticulture)  training,  and  raising  community  awareness  through  life \nskills program on road safety, primary health and gender; and (iii) support to selected local government units to develop \nan  implementation  and  monitoring  model  (including  capacity  development  and  funding  arrangement)  for  rural  feeder \nroadworks. \n\nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.     Findings of Social Analysis \nThe  sector  Project  will  rehabilitate  about  232  km  of  priority  national  or  district  road  links,  and  will  initially  rehabilitate \nthree  road  links  (sample  subprojects);  Liquica\u2013Batugade  link  (74.3  km),  Batugade\u2013Mota  Ain  (2.6  km)  and  Ermera\u2013\nMaliana  link  (63.9  km).  The  current  population  within  the  catchment  of  the  32  priority  links  is  approximately  460,000 \nand is projected to be in the order of 1.01 million at the end of the master plan period, i.e., 2019 (based on continued \ngrowth  at  the  current  rate  of  5.4%  per  annum),  while  the  2019  estimated  population  within  the  catchment  of  the  two \nsample subproject links is approximately 320,000.  \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  the  people  who  currently  live  in  the  178  sucos  (catchments  of  the  32 \npriority road links) to be upgraded, rehabilitated and maintained under the Project. The current beneficiaries of the two \nsample subprojects include about 131,500 people. More specifically, they include the following groups of road users: (i) \nexisting road users, be they vehicle drivers or passengers and/or nonmotorized transport (NMT) users; (ii) households \nliving in communities along, and in the catchment areas of, the upgraded and maintained roads links, who grow and/or \nsell  a  range  of  cash  crops  and  other  agricultural  produce  (including  livestock);  (iii)  passenger  and  goods  (cargo) \ntransport  service  providers  and  commercial  truck  drivers;  and  (iv)  small  businesses  and  traders  including  vendors  at \nlocal  and/or  informal  markets,  trade  store  owners,  coffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  in  the  district  capitals  and  towns.  National,  district,  and  local  (suco)  authorities,  and  key  social  service \nproviders such as in the education and health sector, will also benefit from implementation of road improvements and, \nparticularly, the ongoing maintenance of roads.  \nThere  are  17  languages  spoken  across  the  country  which  can  be  classified  as  being  derived  from  one  of  two  broad \nlanguage  groups:  Austronesian  (Malayo\u2013Polynesian)  and  Papuan  (Melanesian).  In  reality,  little  or  no  significant \ndifferences of cultural and social identity exist among the people. While they speak different languages, the only real \nethnic (or cultural) minority is the small number (5% of population) of Muslims in an otherwise overwhelmingly Roman \nCatholic society. In the area of the 32 priority links, some 14 of the 17 languages are spoken. In the catchments of the \ntwo sample subproject roads, five different languages are spoken. \nAverage  population  density  across  the  country  is  62  people  per  km2,  with  the  highest  population  density  occurring \nbeing Dili (473 people per km2). Two of the sample subproject areas, Ermera (135 people per km2) and Liquica (100 \npeople per km2), account for the districts with the second and third highest population densities. Most households are \nheaded by men (90%). Households headed by women are smaller than households headed by men by an average of \ntwo  people  (both  urban  and  rural  households).  The  dominant  livelihood  activities  for  Timorese  households  combine \nsubsistence agriculture, cash cropping and raising livestock. About 84% (93% in rural areas) of the labor force (those \naged between 15 and 64 years) is engaged in agriculture; however, agriculture contributes only 26% to gross domestic \nproduct,  indicating  a  very  low  level  of  productivity  in  agriculture.  Nearly  all  households  cultivate  food  crops  to  meet \nhousehold consumption needs, with the principal cash crop being coffee. Overall, 37% of households grow coffee as a \ncash crop, 68% grow maize or cassava (subsistence crops), and 31% grow rice.  \nOwnership of motor vehicles had not increased significantly between the 2001 and 2007 TLSLS periods (from 1.8% to \n2.9%);  however,  motorcycle  ownership  had  doubled  (3%\u20136.9%)  and  bicycle  ownership  remained  roughly  the  same \n(5%).  People,  especially  those  in  rural  areas,  walk  or  use  passenger  transport  to  most  destinations.  Nationally,  the \naverage  walking  time  to  the  nearest  motorable  road  is  14.9  minutes;  however,  it  is  significantly  longer  in  the  sample \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n48  \n \nsubproject  area  and  it  ranges  from  19.5  minutes  (Bobonaro)  to  twice  as  long  in  Ermera  (29.5  minutes).  The  project \nsurvey  data  indicates  that  60%  of  the  poor  and  two-thirds  of  the  marginal  (15%  above  the  poverty  line)  are  users  of \nNMT.  The  beneficiary  profile  shows  that  the  main  mode  of  transport  for  children  travelling  to  primary  and  secondary \nschool was by NMT (87.8% and 71.1%) while some travelled by bus (3% and 5%) or by other motorized transport (9% \nand 23%). The children from poor and marginal households have farther to travel to school than children from non-poor \nhouseholds.  Similarly,  a  smaller  proportion  of  poor  (15%)  than  non-poor  (27%)  are  located  within  0.5  km  of  a  health \nclinic  while some 43% of the poor compared with 23% of non-poor must travel between 3.5 km and 9 km to reach a \nhealth clinic. \nImproving access by increasing all-weather road access, reducing travel time, and improving ease of access (providing \nopportunities  for  improved  passenger  transport  services)  will  have  benefits  for  key  social  service  providers  such  as \nthose in the health and education sectors. A comparison of the 2001 and 2007 TLSLS data indicates that while fewer \npeople did not seek treatment for illness due to lack of transport availability (a decrease from 4% in 2001 to 2.6% in \n2007), the proportion of people not seeking treatment for illness as a result of the closest health facility being too far \nand  difficult  to  reach  increased  from  38%  in  2001  to  42.3%  in  2007.  This  was  the  main  reason  given,  out  of  five \npossible  reasons,  for  people  not  seeking  health  treatment  in  the  2007  TLSLS.  The  benefits  of  improving  access  to \nhealth care facilities can contribute to  improving health and  welfare by reducing the proportion of people not seeking \ntreatment  (and  potentially  becoming  more  ill  with  consequent  economic  impact  on  their  households)  as  well  as \nreducing the number of days during which activities are disrupted due to illness. \nThe first HIV/AIDS case in Timor-Leste was detected in 2001, with 43 cases being confirmed in 2007. However, limited \nsurveillance  capabilities  and  inadequate  testing  could  mean  that  actual  infection  rates  are  higher.  Key  at-risk  groups \ninclude  mobile  populations  such  as  truck  drivers,  migrant  workers,  and  commercial  sex  workers.  Overall,  48%  of \npeople in the country are aware of HIV/AIDS. The level of understanding about the causes of HIV/AIDS, and therefore \nhow  to  prevent  it,  varies  across  the  sample  subproject  areas.  The  strategies  to  address  social  issues  and  risks \nassociated with the Project, particularly to enhance benefits for different beneficiary groups, are outlined above in the \ndiscussion  of  design  features  of  the  Project  and  include  a  contractor  and  community  STIs  and  HIV  awareness  and \nprevention program. \nEconomic  benefits  include  (i)  opportunities  to  establish  local  markets  (both  as  a  result  of  improved  national  roads, \ngreater  accessibility  to  district  and  regional  markets  and  towns,  increased  diversity  of  cash  crops,  higher  production \nlevels  and  more  direct  sales,  e.g.,  to  coffee  factories;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  abandoned  coffee  gardens  and/or \nestablishment  of  new  gardens  and  an  expansion  of  rice  cultivation  areas;  (iii)  growth  in  livestock  raising  through \nimproved  access  to  veterinary  services  and  better  access  to  market  opportunities;  (iv)  market  vendors  expect  to  sell \nmore  often,  have  more  customers  and  be  able  to  expand  their  businesses;  (v)  trade  store  owners  also  expect  to \nimprove and expand their businesses; (vi) increased opportunities to create and/or expand micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises, especially those developed by women and poor households (with sufficient support). Social benefits \ninclude  (i)  greater  accessibility  to  schools  leading  to  higher  enrollments,  fewer  dropouts,  and  better  academic \nperformance;  (ii) greater  accessibility  to  health  care  leading  to  improved  health  outcomes  for  women  and  children \n(including increased numbers of people seeking treatment for illness due to reduced travel times); (iii) increased access \nto  government  services  including  existing  services  which  currently  face  access  difficulties  such  as  agricultural  and \nveterinary  extension  services,  as  well  as  new  services  like  electricity;  (iv)  beneficial  impact  on  food  security;  and  (v) \nupgrading  and  sealing  roads  will  reduce  dust  and  improve  health  and  living  conditions  in  roadside  villages.  The \navailability,  frequency,  reliability  and  costs  of  passenger  transport  services  will  improve\u2014for  operators  and  truck \ndrivers,  as  well  as  for  people  who  rely  on  passenger  and  other  transport  services.  These  benefits  will  reach  people \nliving in the catchments of the road links, as well as those living directly along the roads. In addition, over the course of \nthe  Project,  selected  feeder  and  rural  roads  will  be  upgraded  and  maintained  in  three  districts  as  part  of  the  JFPR \nproject, with attendant benefits for those communities.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nAt the inception stage, a stakeholder analysis was carried out to identify the primary and secondary stakeholders; their \ninterests  in  the  Project,  their  perceptions  of  current  problems  related  to  road  accessibility,  and  transport  services. \nMeetings  have  been  held  at  the  national  level  with  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  DRBFC,  PMU  within  MOI, \nInternational  Labor  Organization  (in  Dili  and  at  one  of  their  project  sites  in  Bacau),  RSIP  labor-intensive  component \ncontractors in Manututo, Directorate of Land and Property, Bobonaro District Administration, and CARE International. \n\nA national consultative workshop was held 30 April 2009 which covered all aspects of the Project including the process \nfor  selection  of  subprojects  for  inclusion  and  prioritization  in  the  10-year  master  plan,  phase  2  technical/engineering, \nroad condition  assessment, economic analysis, environmental, social, community-based labor outputs, establishing  a \nroad maintenance fund, and how the community would be involved. Consultation meetings were organized with district \nauthorities  (district  administrators;  regional  and  district  works  departments;  community  development,  health  and \neducation advisors; and district women\u2019s networks); along with other local stakeholders including representatives of the \ncommunity  sector  (local  NGOs,  etc.)  and  the  private  sector  (local  business  households,  bus/truck  drivers,  etc.). \nParticipation  strategy  included  focus  group  discussions  as  well  as  a  structured  methodology  through  survey  tools \n(household socioeconomic survey, traffic survey, and passenger transport operator survey).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing     \n\n Consultation    \n\n Collaborative decision making    \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nMOI,  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project,  will  engage  staff  responsible  for  safeguards  implementation  including \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment,  development  of  management  and  mitigation  plans,  and  community \nconsultation  activities.  The  PMU,  with  assistance  from  a  project  supervision  consultant,  will  establish  a  consultation \nprogram  for  each  subproject.  The  purpose  is  (i)  to  inform  communities  about  the  Project  and,  in  detail,  about  the \nsubproject  works;  (ii)  to  provide  information  about  the  expected  benefits  and  potential  adverse  impact,  as  well  as \nproject measures such as compensation, environmental management, community-based initiatives through the JFPR \nand labor-based maintenance activities; (iii) to provide a forum for communities to participate in the Project and express \ntheir interests, preferences and concerns; and (iv) to facilitate different aspects of the implementation of the subproject. \nConsultations  with  communities  will  take  place  at  different  points  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  subprojects, \nand will be designed not only to inform people about the subproject or specific activities related to its preparation and \nimplementation, but also to enable people in the community to ask questions, make suggestions, state preferences and \nexpress concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable groups.  \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.     Key Issues \nSociocultural factors contribute to low enrollment and high dropout rates of female secondary school (senior) students: \n(i) high female adult illiteracy; (ii) sex segregation in the paid labor force; and (iii) an emerging gender gap in  wages, \nhigh  maternal  mortality  rates,  and  domestic  violence.  Women  have  higher  unemployment  rates  (one  in  four  women \ncompared with one in seven men) and lower labor force participation rates (80% for men and 40% for women). Most \nwomen and men labor in the informal sector, but women tend to be concentrated in the lower income-generating areas \nof  the  informal  workforce.  More  women  than  men  are  engaged  in  activities  such  as  collecting  water  (79%  compared \nwith 65%) and other chores such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes (87% compared with 39%), and looking after \nelders and/or children (43% compared with 30%), as well as spending more hours per week (in some cases spending \ndouble the amount of time) at each of these activities than men.  \nThe Food and Agriculture Organization/World Food Programme estimates that nearly a third of the population live on \ndiet which does not provide the minimum daily nutritional needs and that 9 in 10 persons experience some degree of \nfood shortage at some point during the  year. Food shortages result from a combination of factors: (i) low agricultural \noutput; (ii) high post-harvest cereal losses (up to 50% in upland corn); (iii) distorted food  subsidy policies; (iv) limited \nmarket  access;  and  (v)  the  very  limited  alternative  means  of  earning  incomes  in  rural  areas.  The  common  coping \nmechanisms are to consume less food and to alter the quality and variety of food consumed, such as substituting corn \nfor  rice.  Another  coping  mechanism  that  is  ignored  is  that  women  forgo  food  in  favor  of  children  and  their  families. \nSome 28% of women suffer from malnutrition, of whom 7% are severely malnourished and in need of treatment. \nGender-specific benefits of the Project include (i) increase their agricultural production and expand into new crops and \nother  agricultural  activities  like  raising  animals,  and  as  a  result,  increase  market  sales;  (ii)  improved  (faster,  and \nperhaps,  cheaper)  access  to  health  care  facilities;  (iii)  road  improvements,  including  rural  and  feeder  road \nimprovements under the JFPR project, will mean their children will have improved access to schools and, in general, \ntheir  communities  will  have  better  access  to  social  services  and  key  facilities;  and  (iv)  targeted  employment \nopportunities  as  part  of  feeder  road  rehabilitation  construction  crews  (32  priority  links)  and  as  workers  on  the  JFPR \nproject roads. To support these benefits, additional measures can include (i) footpaths along roads, (ii) safe places to \nwait for passenger transport services; (iii) upgrading of local market facilities or constructing new markets as part of the \nJFPR project; (iv) agricultural extension services that target women\u2019s needs and interests; (iv) training and assistance \nto  learn  new  income-generation  and  business  development  skills;  (v)  training  to  strengthen  roles  and  capacities  of \nwomen\u2019s  groups  including  district  women\u2019s  networks;  and  (vi)  education  and  awareness  programs  in  communities  to \naddress growing social problems and to target construction workers. \n\n2.     Key Actions \nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nGender  has  been  mainstreamed  into  the  design  of  the  Project,  as  well  as  into  the  JFPR  project.  The  resettlement \nframework prepared for the Project includes a range of gender-sensitive measures, requirements for consultation, and \nmonitoring  indicators. The PMU  will  work  with contractors and communities to facilitate the participation of  women in \npaid work opportunities for road rehabilitation, labor-based maintenance, and on rural and feeder roads selected for the \nJFPR project; and ensure that all Timor-Leste labor laws are respected, for instance with respect to equal pay for equal \nwork and no use of child or trafficked labor. HIV/AIDS/STIs awareness and prevention programs will target women as \nwell as men, including the programs instituted by contractors to reach people in construction camps and surrounding \ncommunities.  The  JFPR  will  include  a  major  component  to  work  with  women  as  well  as  men  to  provide  training  and \ntechnical assistance to support income generation and microenterprise creation.  \n \n\n \n\n\fIII.

The  two  subproject  roads  selected  are \nnational  roads:  (i)  Liquica\u2013Batugade  and  Batugade\u2013Mota  Ain  (A03-04),  and  (ii)  Ermera\u2013\nMaliana.  The  two  subprojects  have  existed  for  years  and  are  being  used  for  public  transport. \nAlthough the assessed subprojects pass through a potential protected area and important bird \nareas (both areas do not have legal protection status at present), they will have no significant \nimpact  on  the  surrounding  forests.  An  IEE  has  been  prepared  for  each  core  subproject  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003).  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  summarizes  the  results  of  the \nenvironmental assessments and describes the potential environmental impact of the two sample \nsubprojects, the corresponding mitigation measures, and the environmental monitoring program \nto be established during project implementation.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe subproject road links selected for rehabilitation are important links identified during \nthe  engineering  assessments  and  economic  analyses  for  the  medium-term  road  network \ndevelopment program,  under the technical assistance (TA). They  will improve local as well as \nregional connectivity. The Project is therefore expected to improve access to markets and social \nservices for the population, support sustainable development, and reduce poverty.  \n \n3. \nThe Project is focused on (i) rehabilitating priority national or district roads, (ii) engaging \nnational  small  contractors  for  national  road  maintenance  works,  and  (iii) implementing  annual \nroad maintenance in three border districts\u2014Bobonaro, Ermera, and Liquica. At the completion \nof the Project, (i) about 143 kilometers (km) of national or district roads will have been improved \nto  maintainable  condition,  (ii) a  sustainable  road  maintenance  scheme  will  have  been \nestablished, and (iii) the capacity of MOI to implement road projects and the road maintenance \nprogram (RMP) will have been improved. A start date of January 2011 is proposed. \n \n4. \nThe  road  improvement  works  will  bring  the  road  sections  to  a  maintainable  standard  by \nrepairing  or  replacing  road  pavements,  roadside  drains,  culverts,  culvert  inlets  and  outlets,  and \nretaining walls as required. \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n1. \n \n5. \nTimor-Leste comprises the eastern end of the island of Timor, plus the exclave territory \nof  Oecussi  and  the  islands  of  Atauro  and  Jaco.  Together,  these  occupy  a  land  area  of  about \n14,609  square  kilometers.  Timor  is  the  easternmost  of  the  Lesser  Sunda  Islands,  lying  8\u2013\n10 degrees  south  of  the  equator  and  about  500  km  north  of  Australia.  The  country  has  a \nmountainous topography, dominated by Mount Ramelau, which bisects the island from east to \nwest.  The  highest  point,  Mount  Tatamailau,  is  2,963  meters  above  sea  level  and  less  than \n20 km  from  the  sea.  The  island  is  a  continental  fragment,  composed  largely  of  limestone  and \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  for  Preparing  the  Road  Network \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 7100-TIM). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nother  sedimentary  deposits.  The  island  is  geologically  young,  with  steep  and  unstable  slopes \nand deep valleys, prone to flash floods.  \n \n6. \nIn  many  places  on  Timor-Leste,  extremely  steep  (>40%)  slopes  are  cultivated,  often \nthrough  shifting  cultivation.  High  annual  rainfall  in  the  central  highlands,  combined  with \ndeforestation  and  clearing  of  land  for  agriculture  on  steep  slopes  without  soil  conservation, \nproduces land degradation and frequent landslides. Poor farming practices that exacerbate soil \nerosion include cultivation on steep slopes, without mechanical or planted restrictions on water \nflow (lack of contour bunds, live fences, etc), and burning, especially in dry zone areas. Burning \nthe  grasslands  to  flush  out  game,  traditionally  practiced  in  the  dry  northern  coastal  areas, \nincreases the risk of soil erosion. The young geological age and the high rate of tectonic uplift, \ncombined  with  the  presence  of  weak,  poorly  consolidated  strata,  produce  intractable  stability, \nslope failure, and erosion problems in many areas.  \n \n7. \nThe  climate  of  Timor-Leste  is  hot and  humid or  tropical, with  large  variations in rainfall \nand temperature over short distances because of the steep topography. Broadly speaking, there \nare  two  annual  seasons  determined  by  the  monsoon,  which  varies  in  length  according  to \nlocation,  the  monsoon  lasting  longer  in  the  south  than  in  the  north.  The  following  pattern  is \nidentified: the northern monomodal rain pattern, which produces rain during the 4 months from \nDecember, affects a big part of the north and the east; the southern bimodal rain pattern, which \nstarts December and in May, totaling 7\u20139 months per year, affects the southern part of Timor-\nLeste. \n \n8. \nSurface  water  is  scarce  as  most  rivers  are  not  perennial.  Extensive  and  continued \nclearing of forests and other ground cover substantially reduces the ability of the soil to retain \nwater and can also be expected to add to the scarcity of surface water. The majority of rivers \nflow  only  during  the  wet  season,  at  which  time  they  are  very  turbid  because  of  the  large \namounts of sedimentation washed from the upper catchments. Flooding is a common problem \nin  Timor-Leste,  especially  in  the  low-lying  coastal  plains  along  the  southern  shores.  On  a \nsmaller scale, flooding from overflowing rivers can also occur in the project area. \n \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \n \nThe  Malesian  region,  of  which  Timor-Leste  is  a  part,  is  recognized  as  a  region  of  high \n9. \nplant biodiversity with an estimated 41,000 plant species, including 70% of species endemic to \nthat region. From an assessment of other islands in the region, it can be predicted that the flora \nof Timor Island should consist of around 2,500 species of vascular plants. The composition of \nthe  flora  of  Timor  is  influenced  by  its  location  in  Central  Malesia  (Wallacea),  a  transition  zone \nbetween  the  main  rainforest  blocks  of  the  Sunda  (Peninsular  Malaysia,  Sumatra,  Borneo, \nWest Java) and Sahul (New Guinea) shelves. The flora of Timor is characterized by low levels \nof endemic genera (three); at the species level, endemism is estimated at 10.3%.  \n \n10. \nSome 224 species of birds have been observed in Timor-Leste. Of these, seven species \nand two genera are endemic to the island. The non-bird terrestrial fauna of Timor-Leste is poorly \nknown, with recent surveys discovering new species of bats, frogs, geckos, and skinks, but the \navailable evidence indicates that there are high levels of endemism in all faunal groups. While \nroughly  half  of  the  bird  fauna  originates  from  Asia  and  half  from  Australasia,  the  mammal, \namphibian,  and  reptile  faunas  are  dominated  by  Asian  families  and  species.  At  least \n52 mammal  species  occur  in  Timor-Leste,  mostly  small  and  mobile  species.  There  are  15\u2013\n20 amphibian species and 40 or more reptiles in Timor-Leste.  \n \n11. \nThe  National  Directorate  for  Forestry  under  the  Ministry  for  Agriculture,  Forestry  and \nFisheries  has  prepared  a  list  of  30  potential  protected  wild  areas  (March  2009).  All  of  these \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n54  \n \nareas are in various stages of biological assessment and planning, and most of them have not \nyet been systematically surveyed for lack of personnel and funds. These areas still do not have \nlegal conservation status. The process of identifying, proposing, and appointing areas as sites \nthat are protected by law has so far resulted in one area, Nino Konis Santana, at the country\u2019s \neastern extremity being formally recorded as a national park. This area is likely to be managed \nin a way to allow activities in accordance with laws and tradition by local communities. BirdLife \nInternational\u2019s important bird area program had identified a total of 16 terrestrial important bird \nareas in 2007.  \n \n\nin \n\nEconomic Development \n\nthe  subsistence  economy.  Subsistence  agriculture \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n3. \n \n12. \nTimor-Leste  has  a  population  of  about  1,080,700  (2008  figure,  from  2004  census \nprojection)  and  an  annual  population  growth  rate  (2001\u20132004)  of  5.3%.  The  median  age  is \n18.3 years and life expectancy at birth is 55.5 years, well below the average for East Asian and \nPacific  Island  countries.  On  average,  seven  children  are  born  to  each  woman,  for  a  very  high \nfertility rate (2004 census). \n \nTimor-Leste  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world.  The  majority  of  the  rural \n13. \npopulation  (78%)  participates \nis \ncharacterized by shifting cultivation using the slash-and-burn method. A small amount of income \nis generated by selling cash crops such as coffee, vegetables, and fruits. Numerous varieties of \ntropical root crops and green vegetables are cultivated in this manner. Most of the harvest is for \nhome consumption, but part of it is sold at regular local market outlets depending on demand. \nRoadside  marketing  is  very  common  along  all  roads  surveyed.  Local  residents  trade  their \nproduce for cash with locals and the traveling public.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe subprojects were screened for potential environmental impact, with the help of the \ngeographic  information  system  and  environmental  sensitivity  mapping  tools.  The  Timor-Leste \nenvironmental sensitivity map was developed through a scoring-based method, where for each \nenvironmental input dataset (land cover, slope class, geological stability, and biological values) \na score (numerical value) was assigned on the basis of a selected set of classes. The score for \neach class was assigned by expert judgment, with a score of \u201c1\u201d representing the lowest value \nor  very  low  sensitivity  and  a  score  of  \u201c10\u201d  being  the  highest  value,  reflecting  very  high \nenvironmental sensitivity to change. \n \nThe  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  generally  minor  to  moderate  as  the \n15. \nworks are expected to involve only the rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing roads within \nthe existing road corridors (pavement plus road shoulders). The potential environmental impact \nassociated with the subprojects will occur particularly during pre-construction, construction, and \noperation, and will typically involve the following.  \n \n16. \nImpact  on  potential  protected  areas.  During  project  preparation  the  necessary \nattention will be given to protecting the natural environment in connection with the rehabilitation \nand  maintenance  activities.  Improved  roads  will  facilitate  access  to  sensitive  areas  previously \nprotected by difficult access. This indirect impact will be experienced after construction and will \nbe  considered  in  the  environmental  assessment.  In  Timor-Leste,  the  establishment  of  a \nprotected area network is ongoing; new protected areas are therefore likely to be announced in \nthe future.  \n \n17. \nGeological  instability  and  soil  erosion.  Geological  instability  on  slopes  is  an \nimportant  environmental  sensitivity  consideration  for  roadworks,  especially  in  Timor-Leste. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nWhen  roads  are  built  in  geologically  unstable  areas,  slope  failures  and  shifts  will  damage  or \nblock  roads  and  make  repairs  difficult.  Lack  of  proper  road  maintenance  during  operations \naggravates  environmental  impact  in  geologically  unstable  zones  more  than  in  stable  zones. \nVery  wet  conditions  especially  during  the  monsoon  period,  in  part  of  the  country  (2,500 \nmillimeters  of  rainfall)  can  trigger  slope  failures.  In  many  areas,  construction  activities  are \nfeasible  only  during  the  dry  season.  Slope  stabilization  with  engineering  and  bioengineering \nsolutions and other soil erosion control measures will be undertaken to minimize the problem; at \nthe same time problems of sedimentation and storm water runoff during road construction and \noperation  will  be  addressed.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  strictly  enforce  the \ndisposal of surplus soil material from construction at designated, environmentally safe disposal \nor fill sites.  \n \n18. \nQuarry selection and management. The Project will require materials extraction sites \nfor the reconstruction. Granular material is likely to be extracted from rivers where arrangements \nfor  materials  extraction  are  already  established.  To  select and  manage  quarries  appropriately, \nthe long-term impact of quarrying and gravel extraction will be assessed and mitigated. As part \nof the standard project procedures, the contractor can select the quarry site, but the PMU will \nneed to approve the sites and a quarrying and extraction plan before the start of the extraction, \nin line with the regulatory guidelines of by the Government. The approval of the quarrying and \nextraction  plan  will  consider  both  the  quality  and  the  suitability  of  the  materials,  and  also  the \nenvironmental impact of the specific quarrying site. \n \n19. \nManagement  of  stockpiles,  spoil  heaps,  and  batters.  To  ensure  that  dust  and \nsediment  runoff  are  minimized,  stockpiles,  spoil  heaps,  and  batters  need  to  be  managed \nproperly. Suitable sites for stockpiling and disposal of material will be determined in the detailed \ndesign stage and will preferably be a location where any long-term stockpiles of sediment can \nbe  stabilized  by  vegetation.  The  chosen  disposal  sites  will  be  set  back,  away  from \nwatercourses, drainage lines, and steep or unstable slopes. Any adverse impact will therefore \nbe minimal and temporary. \n \n20. \nAir  quality.  Major  earthworks  are  not  expected,  but  there  is  possibility  of  increasing \ndust  during  construction.  The  impact  of  emissions  is  not  expected  to  be  significant  because \nthese will be for a very short duration. \n \n21. \nfor  a  short  duration. \nNonetheless,  all  mechanical  equipment  (e.g.,  excavators,  drills,  stone  crushers,  concrete \nmixers) will be provided with noise reduction devices such as mufflers where appropriate and, \nwhen  deemed  necessary,  with  buffers  and  other  noise  abatement  measures  to  minimize \nnuisance to nearby sensitive receptors. \n \nE.  \n \n22. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  mitigating \nmeasures recommended to prevent or control the negative impact of the different aspects of the \nproject  on  environment,  life,  and  property  are  properly  followed,  while  the  positive  impact  is \nenhanced  to  gain  maximum  benefits  from  the  Project.  A  copy  of  the  EMP  is  presented  in  the \nIEE report.  \n \n\nNoise.  Construction  activities  may  cause  noise \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\nimpact \n\n1. \n\nPre-construction \n\n \n23. \nDuring the preparation of the detailed design for the road sections, further attention will \nbe  given  in  protecting  potential  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  in  minimizing  negative \nimpact on sensitive ecosystems or the natural environment through the use of environmentally \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n56  \n \nsound  design.  Subproject  selection  criteria  will  ensure  that  the  subprojects  do  not  harm  any \necologically or culturally sensitive areas. This is to avoid (i) significant loss or damage to natural \nenvironments, such as lakes, rivers, forests, reefs, mangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(ii) permanent  negative  effect  on  known  rare  or  endangered  species;  and  (iii)  permanent \ndamage  to  irreplaceable  cultural  relics  and  archaeological  sites.  Road  construction  and \nrehabilitation projects can lead to changes in the community or social environment around the \nroad,  influencing  various  aspects  of  lifestyles,  travel  patterns,  and  social  and  economic \nactivities.  ADB  policies for  land  acquisition  and resettlement  will  be  applied  when  dealing  with \nthese issues during the pre-construction phase. \n\nConstruction \n\n \n2. \n \n24. \nConstruction-related  activities  include  (i) removal  and  disposal  of  excess  construction \nmaterial, spoil material, and debris; (ii) control of erosion; (iii) storage and handling of materials \nincluding  fuel  and  lubricants;  (iv) management  of  construction  camps;  (v) control  of  noise  and \ndust  from  construction  activities;  (vi) measures  to  ensure  worker  and  community  health  and \nsafety;  and  (vii) management  of  solid  and  liquid  waste.  Construction  impact  will  be  short  term \nand can be mitigated by addressing the EMP requirements. Of particular importance in Timor-\nLeste  are  mitigation  measures  to  control  slope  failure  and related  erosion,  sedimentation,  and \npolluted storm water impact in areas of high geological instability. In these areas, construction \nshould  be  carried  out  only  in  dry  weather,  with  revegetation  and  bioengineering  solutions \napplied where appropriate. \n \n25. \nThe  mitigation  measures  include  (i) proper  handling  of  stockpiles,  spoil heaps,  and \nbatters; (ii) proper storage and handling of petroleum products; (iii) provision of on-site sanitary \nfacilities;  (iv) spraying  of  sources  of  dust;  (v) proper  maintenance  of  all  machineries; \n(vi) limitation  of  work  hours  to  the  daytime;  and  (vii) installation  of  noise  abatement  measures \nwhere necessary to minimize nuisance to nearby settlement areas. The implementation of the \nEMP will be the responsibility of the MOI through the contractor, supervised by the PMU of MOI \ninternational \nwith \nenvironmental  specialist  and  a  national  environmental  specialist  will  be  part  of  the  consulting \nteam, supporting the PMU in the strict enforcement of the EMP. \n \n\nimplementation  support  consultants.  An \n\nthe  support  of \n\nthe  project \n\nOperation  \n\n3. \n \n26. \nAdequate  routine  maintenance  is  required  to  minimize  environmental  impact  during \noperation.  This  refers  to  activities  such  as  grading,  grass  cutting,  drain  clearing,  pothole \npatching, and shoulder repairs, which are performed at regular intervals. Periodic maintenance \nactivities are typically scheduled over several years and include resurfacing and bridge repairs. \nOther  periodic  maintenance  activities  are  seasonal  maintenance  such  as  flood  repairs, \nemergency maintenance to reinstate roads after major failures, and the regular upkeep of safety \nfeatures  and  road  signs.  Environmental  impact  from  maintenance  activities  is  commonly \ninsignificant. Noise originating from roads operation cannot be considered a major concern, as \ntraffic volumes are generally low.  \n \nF. \n \n27. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MOI.  The  overall  sector  project  will  be \noverseen  by  the  minister  of  infrastructure.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation. A consulting firm (project implementation support consultants) will be engaged \nto  work  with  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  conduct  subproject  feasibility  documentation,  design, \nsupervision,  and  other  aspects  of  project  administration  as  described  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President. Its tasks will also include the environmental management of \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nin \n\nto \n\n(ii) monitor \n\nrequired,  and \n\nteam  assigned \n\nthe  PMU/project \n\nthe  Project  responsible \n\nimplementation  support  consultant \n\nPublic Information and Information Disclosure \n\ninternational  development  agencies,  and  district  administrations  attended \n\nthe Project in compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements, and the training and \ncapacity building of MOI staff in environmental management and monitoring. Considering MOI\u2019s \nstaff  constraints,  existing  engineers  and  officers  (3  regional  engineers  and  13  district \nsupervisors) will also be trained to handle the environmental management of the Project. They \nwill  be  engineer-cum-environmental  officers  of \nfor  overseeing \nenvironmental management at the sites. \n \n28. \nMonitoring will relate to compliance with construction contracts, the state of health of the \nnearby environmental resources, and the effectiveness of mitigation measures and complaints. \nThe  project  costs  for  the  subprojects  incorporate  a  budget  and  the  resources  needed  to \n(i) undertake  environmental  mitigation  measures  as \nthe \nimplementation  of  EMPs.  The  responsibility  for  undertaking  the  monthly  monitoring  and \npreparing  the  quarterly  monitoring  report  on  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  will  rest  with  the \nthe \nperson \nenvironmental  management  of  the  Project.  Progress  reports  will  be  submitted  quarterly  to  the \nNational Directorate for Environmental Services of the Government and every 6 months to ADB. \n \nG. \n \n29. \nA  public  consultation  was  held  on  30  April  2009.

The  participants  were  actively  involved  in  discussions  related  to  poverty  reduction, \nthe Project\u2019s goals, and environmental issues. As the opportunity arose, local stakeholders were \nconsulted  and  informed  before  and  during  the  field  visits  to  proposed  subproject  roads.  They \nstated that road deteriorations are mainly caused by poor maintenance of drainage and too-few \nculverts and bridges, and expressed their interest in being consulted further during design and \nimplementation.  On  the  side  of  the  Government,  officers  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nDevelopment,  the  National  Directorate  for  Environmental  Services  (at  the  central  and  district \nlevels),  and  the  Directorate  for  Protected  Areas  and  National  Parks  under  the  Division  of \nForestry of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should be included in this process. \n \n30. \nThe  disclosure  of  environmental  assessment  documents  will  follow  the  procedures  of \nADB  and  the  Government,  including  the  provision  in  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy \n(2005) requiring the disclosure of the relevant environment information in an appropriate form, \nmanner,  and  language  and  at  an  accessible  location  to  be  understandable  to  the  affected \npeople and local NGOs.  \n \nH. \n \n31. \nAn  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  has  been  prepared.  It  presents  the \nimpact,  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  subproject \ngeneral  anticipated  environmental \nenvironmental  procedure.  It  will  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  of  environmental \nassessments of future subprojects likely to be financed under the Project, in compliance with the \nGovernment\u2019s as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements. The MOI as the Executing Agency \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  assessment  review  procedure \nincluding the preparation of the subsequent IEE or SIEE, and the implementation of EMP and \nthe  environmental  monitoring  plan.  Public  consultations  will  be  carried  out  during  the \npreparation of the IEE for future subprojects, and MOI will submit the required documentation to \nADB.  \n \n32. \nThe  PMU  in  MOI  will  prepare  an  IEE  for  each  future  subproject  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview and clearance prior to contracting or the start of work. The PMU will obtain approval from \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Review Procedure \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n58  \n \nthe  National  Directorate  for  Environmental  Services    according  to  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment before the start of construction. In addition, the PMU will ensure that the EMP and \nthe  required  mitigation  measures  for  construction  activities  are  included  in  the  contractors\u2019 \ncontracts, with requirements to update the EMP in response to any unexpected impact. MOI will \nensure that the EMP and all mitigation measures during construction are fully implemented. \n \n33. \nDuring  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  review  the  environmental \nassessment  reports  for  future  subprojects  submitted  for  approval,  disclose  the  environmental \nassessments  where  necessary,  and  monitor  the  EMP  implementation  and  conduct  due \ndiligence  as  part  of  the  review  of  the  Project.  ADB  will  assist  MOI  in  carrying  out  its \nresponsibilities and building capacity, and ensure that MOI conducts the required consultations \nwith  project-affected  groups  and  local  NGOs,  providing  accessible  relevant  information  on  the \nProject\u2019s environmental issues according to ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n \nI. \n \n34. \nFrom the IEE, it can be concluded that significant or irreversible impact is unlikely, and \nthe  subprojects  assessed  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  policies.  All  potential \nenvironmental  concerns  listed  in  the  EMP  can  be  mitigated.  Subsequently,  the  EMP  provides \nsufficient  guidance  for  the  PMU  to  successfully  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \nreport on environmental compliance. \n \n35. \nAlthough  the  proposed  road  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  located  or  pass  through \npotential  protected  areas  and  important  bird  areas  (both  areas  do  not  have  legal  protection \nstatus  at  present),  the  road  rehabilitation  will  have  no  significant  impact  on  the  surrounding \nforests. This is primarily because the subprojects concern existing roads and minor to moderate \ninterventions. The works can generally be carried out within the existing road reserve, and  no \ndisplacement  of  people  will  be  necessary.  Provided  the  requirements  of  the  EMP  to  mitigate \npotentially adverse impact during subproject construction are met, there will be no significant or \nlong-term impact on the forested area, and no additional or special studies are needed. There \nwill be a replanting program to replace cut trees. No significant associated or cumulative impact \nis identified.  \n \nThe alternative option to implementation of this project is not to rehabilitate the roads\u2014\n36. \nthe \u201cdo-nothing\u201d option. This option is not acceptable as it will not prevent further deterioration \nand collapse of the roads and will potentially have a significant impact on remote rural villages \nthat rely on the roads for transport and access to markets and social services. \n \nJ. \n \nThe  results  of  the  IEE  indicate  that  the  subprojects  will  have  no  major  environmental \n37. \nimpact and that all environmental impact can be mitigated to an insignificant level. The costs of \nenvironmental mitigations and monitoring are included in the project budget. Therefore, a more \ndetailed environmental impact assessment is not warranted, and the IEE will be finalized as the \nfinal environment assessment of the subprojects.  \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n1. \nA  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). These documents provide \nguidance to establish the policies and procedures for payment of compensation to affected people \nfor  lost  or  damaged  assets  and  minor  land  acquisition.  During  the  preparation  of  each  batch  or \ngroup of subprojects, the policies and provisions of the resettlement framework will be reviewed \nand,  as  required,  updated  to  reflect  the  conditions  and  requirements  for  upgrading  roads,  but \nwithout lowering the standards set out in the present resettlement framework. \n \n2. \nAssurances. One of the loan assurances for the Project, agreed by the Government and \nADB, states that no subproject may require land acquisition that will incur significant resettlement \nimpact. Therefore, the Project is categorized as \u201cB\u201d in terms of resettlement impact according to \nADB policy. In case certain subprojects may require temporary land access beyond the existing \npavement, the resettlement framework will set out measures to address such impacts. \n \n3. \nExisting land tenure and use. Of an estimated 200,000 land parcels in the country as a \nwhole, less than 25% have ever been formally registered. Origin groups have authority over land \nallocations, including permission for the clearing and cultivating of new land. Within the system of \norigin  group  authority,  there  are  highly  individuated  rights  to  land.  It  is  not  accurate  to  describe \ncustomary land in Timor-Leste in terms of communal or common property only; residential, garden \nand plantation plots are \"owned\" by families rather than the group itself, and generally these plots \nremain under family control. \n \n4. \nScreening  for  impact. The criteria noted in Appendix 4 will be used during a subproject \nscreening  process  to  confirm  eligible  subprojects  among  the  identified  32  priority  links.  The \nscreening  process  will  identify  the  types  and  nature  of  potential  impact  associated  with  land \nrequirements and provide adequate measures to address them so as to ensure that the affected \npersons are (i) informed about their options and rights; (ii) included in a consultation process and \ngiven the opportunity to participation in the selection of eligible subprojects; and (iii) provided with \nprompt and effective compensation at replacement cost for loss of or damage to affected assets. \nThe routine and periodic maintenance of roads under the Project will not require the acquisition of \nany land; all maintenance will be carried out within the existing roadway. \n \n5. \nEntitlements. The Project\u2019s entitlement matrix was prepared as a part of the resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix N). Affected persons will be compensated for any loss of or \ndamage  to  land,  crops,  trees,  temporary  structures  or  other  assets,  as  per  the  policies  of  this \nresettlement  framework.  All  costs  for  the  Project  related  to  land  acquisition,  compensation  and \nallowances, operation and administration costs, surveys, monitoring and reporting will be financed \nby the Government using counterpart funds. \n \n6. \nAll people who own crops, trees, temporary structures or other assets on affected land are \nentitled to compensation for the loss of or damage to these assets. Compensation will be paid in \ncash  at  replacement  cost.  In  addition  to  compensation,  affected  persons  are  entitled  to \nassistance, for example, to shift temporary trade shop structures, for disruption of businesses or, \nto move personal possessions. Affected persons will also receive priority for employment for civil \nworks  and  ongoing  maintenance  under  the  Project,  as  well  as  participation  in  the  community \nempowerment component in three selected districts.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n60  \n \n\nCommunity  consultation. The project management unit (PMU), to be established within \n7. \nthe  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI),  will  organize  consultations  with  each  affected  community. \nParticipants will include appointed and traditional leaders in the village, affected landowners and \ncommunity  people  affected  by  the  loss  of  assets  on  the  affected  land.  Village  leaders  will \nencourage all other community members to attend including women, elderly people, young people \nand ethnically different population; because women and some ethnic groups are often reluctant to \nspeak in general community meetings, as relevant, separate meetings may be held with them to \nunderstand and discuss their preferences and concerns.  \n \n8. \nThe key consultations will occur prior to and/or as part of (i) the subproject screening and \npreparation  of  the  subprojects;  (ii)  carrying  out  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  social \nsurveys; and (iii) disclosure and review of the draft resettlement plan. The PMU will consult with \ncommunities  and  affected  people  on  related  issues,  as  required,  throughout  the  process  of  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  subprojects.  Throughout  these  consultations,  the  objectives \nare (i) to provide timely and complete information about the project, land requirements and impact, \nto  enable  people  to  make  informed  decisions;  (ii)  to  ensure  that  all  affected  persons  and  other \ninterested  stakeholders  know  and  understand  the  policies  and  procedures  related  to  additional \nland required to upgrade the road; and (iii) to build and maintain community support for the Project \nby addressing the concerns and preferences of affected persons and other stakeholders. Prior to \ndisclosure, the resettlement framework will be endorsed by MOI as the executing agency for the \nProject.  Disclosure  of  the  resettlement  framework  (or  its  summary)  and  resettlement  plans  will \noccur as per ADB policies. \n \n9. \nGrievance redress. The grievance redress mechanisms for the Project will be established \nin  MOI  to  ensure  that  all  affected  person  grievances  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition  and/or \ncompensation  for  affected  assets  are  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory  manner.  Affected \npersons will be made fully aware of their rights (both verbally and in writing) during consultations \nabout  land  requirements  for  the  Project.  In  the  event  of  grievances  that  cannot  be  resolved \nthrough  local  mediation,  the  matter  will  be  referred  to  the  land  court  system.  In  this  case,  the \nproject  and  district  land  and  property  officer  will  hold  the  compensation  amounts  in  escrow. \nCompensation will be paid in full upon final resolution of the case in the courts or other forum, in \naccordance with the entitlements of the affected person. \n \n10. \nExecuting  agency.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI)  is  the  executing  agency  for  the \nProject.  The  PMU  will  monitor  and  report  semiannually  to  the  MOI  and  ADB  on  all  activities \nassociated  with  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans  including  payment  of \ncompensation to affected persons. The scope of internal monitoring includes (i) compliance with \nthe  agreed  policies  and  procedures;  (ii)  prompt  approval,  allocation  and  disbursements  of  funds \nand  payment  of  compensation  to  affected  persons,  including  supplemental  compensation  for \nadditional and/or unforeseen losses; (iii) the availability of other resources and efficient, effective \nuse of these resources; and (iv) requirements for remedial actions. \n \n11. \nExternal monitoring. The MOI will recruit a full-time national social safeguard specialist to \nmonitor day-to-day resettlement implementation as well as international and national consultants \nto monitor resettlement issues for all subprojects. The consultants will be recruited and mobilized \nat the beginning of the Project; and will monitor and report to MOI and ADB on all activities related \nto  impact  on  land,  community  consultations,  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  and  payment  of \ncompensation.  The  purpose  of  hiring  consultants  is  to  focus  on  the  social  impact  of  the \nsubprojects and whether affected persons are able to restore, and preferably improve, their pre-\nproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n", "The currency in Timor-Leste is the US dollar. \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nDRBFC \nEMP \nICB \nIEE \nJFPR \nJICA \nkm \nMOF \nMOI \nNCB \nNGO \nPISC \nPMU \nRMP \nRSIP \nTA \nTLSLS \nUN \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nDirectorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control \nenvironmental management plan \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nkilometer \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Infrastructure \nNational competitive bidding \nnongovernment organization \nproject implementation support consultant \nproject management unit \nroad maintenance program \nRoad Sector Improvement Project \ntechnical assistance \nTimor-Leste survey of living standards \nUnited Nations \n", "NOTES \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends,  e.g., \nFY2009 ends on 31 December 2009.  \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
