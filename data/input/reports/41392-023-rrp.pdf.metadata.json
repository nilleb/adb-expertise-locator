The \nprogram  will  (i)  support  the  development  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for \ndecentralization,  and (i) provide funding to  establish the  Sub-National Investment  Fund  (SNIF) \nto  provide  eligible  subnational  administrations  with  financial  resources  for  local  investment \nprojects.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3.  \nDevelopment problem. Despite an impressive record of economic growth, development \nin Cambodia is uneven, with large regional inequalities. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by \nan  average  of  over  6%  between  2007  and  2015  while  the  poverty  rate  declined  to  13.5% in \n2014 from 47.8% in 2007.2 However, national poverty averages mask large regional disparities. \nIn 2009\u20132010 the poverty rate in Phnom Penh (4.3%) was less than one-sixth that of rural areas \n(27.5%),3 while average poverty rates in the poorest seven provinces in the country were all well \nover 30%. About 91% of the poor live in rural areas, and the proportion is increasing. Moreover, \nmore women join the labor market in rural areas, but they are mostly unpaid family workers. As \na  result,  the  multidimensional  poverty  index  is  five  times  higher  in  rural  than  in  urban  areas.4 \nFurther, sanitation can be accessed by just 37% of the population, and clean water sources by \n44%, while access in urban areas is over 70%. These regional disparities limit inclusive growth \nand  employment  generating  opportunities  for  the  country  as  a  whole,  and  restrain  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to meet its development goals and reduce poverty.  \n \nBinding  constraints.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  is  aware  of  these  large  regional \n4.  \ninequalities. Reforms aim to improve the management capacity of local administrations, and to \ninvolve citizens in the decision-making processes, enabling more efficient public service delivery \nwhich fits local needs and reduces these regional inequalities. However, the government faces \na number of critical binding constraints, including inefficient service delivery, weak local revenue \nbases  and  fiscal  management  systems,  and  a  lack  of  effective  feedback  mechanisms.  These \nconstraints are elaborated in paras 5\u20137. \n \nInefficient  service  delivery  systems  across  levels  of  administration.  Spending  by \n5. \nsubnational administrations in Cambodia represented only 7% of total government spending in \n2014,  with  districts,  municipalities,  and  communes  (the  focus  of  decentralization  efforts) \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2012.

Cambodia\u2019s  three  tiers  of  subnational  governments  display  a \nmixture of fiscal deconcentration and decentralization and as a result, the assignment of district \nand  municipality-level  functional  expenditure  responsibilities  is  not  clear.  This  lessens  public \nsector  efficiency,  and  there  is  a  limited  capacity  within  subnational  administrations  to  deliver \nbasic  services  and  realize  economies  of  scale.  More  needs  to  be  done  to  develop  an \noverarching  framework  for  decentralization,  provide  for  a  clear  division  of  responsibility,  and \nidentify efficient service delivery mechanisms.  \n \nWeak local revenue bases and financial management systems. Currently, only 3.6% \n6. \nof  national  revenues  are  distributed  to  districts,  municipalities,  and  communes  through  fiscal \ntransfers.  Further,  subnational  administrations  in  Cambodia  which  serve  rural  areas  are \nestimated to generate only 60% of own-resource revenue. Recent progress under subprogram \n1  is  encouraging  as  an  additional  2%  of  the  national  budget  will  be  transferred  to subnational \nadministrations over 2017\u20132018 to support the decentralization of rural water supplies and solid \nwaste  collection.  In  addition,  the  government  established  the  District  and  Municipal  Fund. \nNevertheless, the lack of tax and non-tax revenue assignments reduces the accountability of the \nsubnational administrations. There is a continuing lack of funds for local investment projects and \nperformance-based  funding  mechanisms  have  not  been  deployed.  Deeper  reforms  will  be \nrequired,  beginning  with  the  provision  of  additional  fiscal  transfers,  tax,  and  non-tax  revenue \nassignments to subnational administrations. \n \n7. \nFledging  local  governance  systems  and  social  accountability  mechanisms. Clear \nstatutes  for  subnational  administrations  are  needed  to  clarify  the  rules  and  procedures \napplicable to local councils and their executives. In turn, these rules and procedures will enable \ntheir  constituents to fulfill  their  responsibilities to monitor  them.  Currently,  citizens  do  not  have \naccess  to  local  plans  and  budgets,  nor  do  they  have  the  systems  to  monitor  subnational \nadministrations.  Moreover,  both  subnational  administrations  and  their  constituents  lack  the \ntechnical capacity to utilize such a framework.   \n \n8. \nGovernment  reform  agenda  and  past  ADB  interventions. The government\u2019s reform \nframework  is  contained  in  the  national  program,5  which  is  implemented  through  3-year \nimplementation  plans  (IP3s).  Key  legal  aspects  of  the  reform  effort  include:  the  2008  Organic \nLaw  on  Capital,  Provinces,  Municipalities,  Districts,  and  Khans;  and  the  2011  Sub-national \nFinance  Law.  The  country  partnership strategy,  2014\u20132018 for  Cambodia  includes a focus on \npublic  sector  management  and  identifies  decentralization  and  deconcentration  as  core \ncomponents. 6  \n \n9. \nAchievements  under  Subprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  1,  a  $1.5  million  TA  loan \nsupported a number of initiatives, including the assignment of non-tax revenues to subnational \nadministrations,  the  establishment  of  the  SNIF,  and  the  design  and  implementation  of  public \nfinancial management (PFM) systems for monitoring subnational administrations. Subprogram 1 \nalso  supported  the  pilot  decentralization  of  rural  water  supply  operations.  Although  much  has \nbeen  achieved,  efforts  to  transfer  fiscal  revenue  to  subnational  administrations  were  not \nsuccessful.  In  response,  subprogram  2  supported  the  establishment  of  the  SNIF  to  promote \nfiscal transfer and provide capacity building to subnational administrations.     \n \n\n                                                \n5   Government  of  Cambodia.  2009.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nthan  executing  and \n\nimplementing  agencies, \n\nLessons  from  ADB  support  for  reform  design  and  implementation.  A  number  of \n10. \nlessons have emerged from prior ADB engagements. First, both the Ministry of Interior and the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) should be engaged as lead implementing agencies to \nfacilitate inter-agency dialogue. In addition, targeted technical assistance needs to be provided \nto  support \nto  priority  ministries,  other \ndecentralization  of  service  delivery.  In  addition,  decentralization  reforms  must  be  coordinated \nwith national public financial management reforms to ensure consistency between the national \ngovernment and subnational administrations. Finally, capacity building is necessary to manage \nthe large number of stakeholders involved in policy formulation and need for consensus.      \n \n11. \nSector  development  program  approach  and  budget  support.  Implementation  of \nsubprogram 1 demonstrated the benefits of combining a policy-based loan with a project loan, \nand  subprogram  2  proposes  to  expand  this  approach.7  This  allows  for  adequate  coordination \nand sequencing  of reforms  and  the  execution  of  strategic  initiatives,  such as the  SNIF.  Of the \ntotal  $35  million  equivalent  in  planned  financial  support,  the  policy-based  loan  component  \n($15 million equivalent) facilitates the articulation of a medium-term framework of policy reforms, \nwhich is at an early stage in Cambodia, and provides the government the flexibility to sequence \nthe reforms. The project loan investment ($20 million equivalent) will support a pilot subnational \ngovernment investment grant scheme to fund 184 projects.  \n \nDevelopment  partners\u2019  coordination.  ADB  is  the  lead  development  partner  in  this \n12. \nsector,  and  co-chairs  the  development  partners\u2019  working  group  on  decentralization  reforms. \nEuropean and Japanese development partners are active in the areas of decentralization reform \nand subnational developments.      \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  access  to  and  coverage  of  basic  services  across  the \ncountry.  The  outcome  will  be  an  efficient  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  that \nassists with service delivery by subnational administrations. The proposed subprogram includes \na  policy-based  loan  and  a  project  loan.  The  policy-based  loan  includes  22  reform  actions  \n(14  triggers  and  8  milestones),8  which  the  Government  completed  from  2012  to  2016.9  The \nproject loan will provide assistance to the establishment and operations of the SNIF.  \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nPolicy-Based Loan Outputs  \n\n1. \n \nThe  policy-based  loan  is  structured  around  seven  major  outputs  drawn  from  the \n\n14. \ngovernment\u2019s IP3 for the national program (footnote 6) described in paras 15\u201321. \n \n15. \nfor  decentralization \ndeveloped  and  regularly  updated.  The  government  has  continued  to  provide  a  high-level \nframework  to  guide  decentralization.  A  midterm  review  of  the  first  IP3  (2011\u20132014)  was \n\nA  gender-sensitive  policy  and  regulatory \n\nframework \n\n                                                \n7  \n\nIn  the  concept  paper,  subprogram  2  was  initially  proposed  as  a  policy-based  loan,  but  changed  due  to  the \nsuccessful implementation of subprogram 1. \n\n8   The  completion  of  policy  triggers  is  a  requirement  for  the  loan.  The  policy  mile  stones,  represent  additional \n\nreforms implemented by the government. \n\n9   The  policy  matrix  originally  contained  39  reform  actions,  comprised  of  17  triggers  and  22  milestones.  After \nconfirming the completion of all 39 measures during fact-finding, the policy matrix was restructured to simplify the \npresentation. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nconducted, including a gender audit, and the annual implementation reports were distributed to \nand  widely  discussed  among  stakeholders.  The  government  subsequently  reviewed  and \nupdated its implementation strategy for decentralization. Utilizing these lessons and feedback, a \nsecond  IP3  (2015\u20132017)  was  approved  that  incorporates  gender  issues  in  the  objectives, \nimplementation approach, and monitoring and evaluation framework.  \n \n16. \nInstitutions  for  efficient  coordination  of  subnational  democratic  development \npolicies established. The government strengthened the institutions that are leading the reform \nagenda.  A  full  staff  complement,  20%  of  who  are  women,  has  been  provided  to  the  National \nCommittee  for  Sub-National  Democratic  Development  (NCDD-S),  and  it  has  received  a  stable \nnational  budgetary  allocation  since  2012.  Further,  the  government  has  strengthened  the \ncapacity  of  subnational  administrations  \u2014close  to  30%  of  advisors  and  staff  in  subnational \nadministrations are women\u2014 to manage their personnel by approving permanent regulations for \nhuman  resource  management,  giving  them  the  ability  to  appoint,  move  and  terminate  civil \nservants working at subnational level.  \n \nClear service delivery responsibilities of subnational administrations defined. The \n17. \ngovernment  has  assigned  districts  and  municipalities  new  responsibilities  for  service  delivery. \nFunctions  eligible  to  be  devolved  to  subnational  administrations  were  identified  through  a \ngovernment  subdecree,  which  was  approved  in  2014,  and  pilot  projects  to  decentralize  the \noperation of health facilities and the operation and maintenance of district rural water supplies \nhas  begun.  Additional  proposals  for  the  reassignment  of  functions  \u2014including  for  rural \ndevelopment,  education,  environment,  and  social  affairs\u2014  have  been  completed,  and  the  first \nfull  service  decentralization  (solid  waste  collection)  is  underway.  Construction  of  34  district \noffices  in  poor  rural  areas  to  assist  with  efficient  service  delivery  is  underway  and  will  be \ncompleted in 2016.  \n \n18. \nEfficient  tax  and  non-tax  revenue  to  subnational  administrations  assigned.  The \ngovernment  has  made  important  progress  in  mobilizing  revenue  at  the  subnational  level.  A \nprakas  (proclamation)  was  issued  in  December  2013  by  the  Non-Tax  and  State  Property \nDepartment  of  the  MEF,  which  defined  administrative  fees  and  charges  for  all  subnational \nadministrations. In addition, an MEF subdecree was drafted to provide for the assignment of tax \nrevenue for districts and municipalities. The Government has submitted the draft subdecree to \nthe General Secretariat of the PFM reform committee for approval.  \n \n19. \n Fiscal  transfers  that  ensure  comparable  levels  of  service  delivery  across \nsubnational  administrations  implemented. The government has provided an increased level \nof  fiscal  transfers  to  support  decentralization.  Since  2013,  MEF  has  used  a  formula-based \napproach to  allocate transfers to the  provincial  level,  and has  completed  a review  of financing \nmodalities for provinces leading to the definition of multiannual budget programs. In addition, the \ngovernment  has  gradually  increased  the  budget  allocation  to  the  District  and  Municipal  Fund \nfrom 0.8% of national revenues in 2015 to 0.9% in 2016, and 1% in 2017. The Prime Minister \nestablished the SNIF through the approval of a subdecree, and a budgetary allocation has been \nautomatically  appropriated  in  the  2016  budget.  The  SNIF,  which  provides  a  conditional  grant \nearmarked  for  local  infrastructure  and  investment  projects,  will  be  allocated  to  eligible  districts \nusing a formula-based approach. Finally, the government has designed a system of conditional \ngrants  to  support  the  delegated  delivery  of  water  by  subnational  administrations,  with \nimplementation of the first pilot project scheduled for 2015.  \n \n20. \nCapacity  in  support  of  efficient  decentralized  public  financial  management \ndeveloped. The government continues to develop a regulatory framework for the decentralized \n\n\f5 \n\nfinancial management system. A standardized Sub-National Budget Classification and Chart of \nAccounts  have  been  completed.  Regulations  have  been  issued  to  govern  the  procurement, \nbudget  formulation  and  implementation,  payment  and  accounting  systems  of  districts  and \nmunicipalities. The capacity of the National Audit Authority to audit subnational administrations \nhas  been  strengthened.    Specific  financial,  compliance,  and  performance  audit  procedures \napplicable to subnational administrations have been developed. All auditors have been trained \nto use the new procedures and the number of provinces, municipalities, and communes audited \nin 2014 has increased significantly over 2013. Subnational administrations have been trained to \nuse  financial  management  systems,  and  efforts  are  underway  to  improve  the  capacity  of  the \nGeneral  Department  Sub-national  Administration  to  undertake  financial  management  and \nmonitoring.10  These  efforts  include:  (i)  the  review  and  prioritization  of  an  inventory  of  PFM \nregulations  governing  subnational  administration  finance;  (ii)  provision  of  a  PFM  manual  for \nsubnational  administrations;  (iii)  design  and  implementation  of  a  financial  database  for \nsubnational administrations; and (iv) defining the scope of capacity development activities of the \nGeneral Department Sub-National Administration Finance.  \n \n21. \ntheir \nconstituencies  designed  and  implemented.  The  government  has  implemented  policies  to \nincrease  the  social  and  political  accountability  of  local  administrations  to  their  constituents. \nCoaching  and  mentoring  systems  have  been  implemented,  and  technical  manuals  to  guide \nsubnational  council  meetings  and  public  forums  have  been  completed.  Training  and  capacity \ndevelopment has been delivered to all districts covering 3,324 councilors, including 425 women. \nThe  district  and  municipal  mentors  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  training  activities, \napproximately  25%  of  which  are  women,  were  hired  as  part  of  the  NCDD-S  advisory  and \nsupport staff for subnational administrations. The district charter template has been approved by \nthe  NCDD  chair  and  implementation  has  begun  in  10  districts.  Finally,  a  social  accountability \nframework for subnational administrations has been approved by the NCDD-S and will increase \ntransparency and accountability between subnational administrations and their constituents.  \n \n\n Accountability  mechanisms \n\nadministrations \n\nsubnational \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n2.  \n\nProject Loan Output \n\n \n22. \n Sub-National  Investment  Fund  established  and  operations  started.  The  project \nloan will finance the SNIF which will be used to fund local investment projects.  These projects \nwill  include  civil  works,  goods  for  subnational  administrations,  equipment,  and  consultancy \nservices for the SNIF Secretariat to be delivered between 2017 and 2021. Consultancy services \nwill include: (i) capacity development for the SNIF Secretariat and subnational administrations; \n(ii) annual performance assessments of subnational administrations; (iii) annual evaluation and \naudit of investments; (iv) external audit of SNIF finances; and (v) technical backstopping support \nfor  the  SNIF  Secretariat.  To  participate  in  the  program,  subnational  administrations  will  be \nsubject  to  an  annual  performance  assessment  against  a  number  of  criteria  including  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  capacity.  Eligible  subnational  administrations  will  submit \ninvestment  project  proposals  from  a  positive  list  of  subsectors  maintained  by  the  SNIF  Board. \nThe SNIF Secretariat will evaluate the proposals and submit those which pass the pre-screen to \nthe Board for evaluation and approval. The selection criteria against which investment projects \nare evaluated have been included in the project administration manual (PAM)11 and the project \nloan agreement.  \n\n                                                \n10   This  training  was  conducted  by  the  Departments  of  Procurement,  Treasury,  and  Sub-national  Administration \n\n11    Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFinance. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nD. \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (policy-based loan) \nAsian Development Bank (project loan) \nGovernment of Cambodia \n\nTotal \n\nAmount ($ million) \n                 15.00 \n                 20.00  \n                 10.70  \n                 45.70  \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n32.82 \n43.76 \n23.42 \n100.0 \n\na  Bank charges related to the imprest account may be financed from the loan proceed. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n23. \nThe program is estimated to cost $45.7 million. The government has requested a loan in \nvarious  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR25,034,000  ($35  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  (table  1).  The  loan  size  is  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs, the strength of the policy reform package, and its development \nimpact.  The  benefits  arise  from  improved  state  allocative  efficiency  decentralization  of  service \ndelivery),  higher  revenue  collection,  and  strengthened  local  governance.  Cambodia\u2019s  gross \nfinancing  needs  remain  high.

The  benefits  arise  from  improved  state \nallocative efficiency (decentralization of service delivery) and improved revenue collection. The \n                                                \n13  Inclusion  of  taxes  and  duties  on  ADB-financed  project  expenditures  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy (footnote 6, above). Financing of taxes and duties does not represent an excessive share of the project \ncost and is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\ninformation  systems  at \n\nthe  MEF  and  provincial \n\ncosts  of  the  reform  program,  including  the  fiscal  costs  of  implementing  reforms  and  related \nadministrative  costs  total  $65  million.  Thus,  the  program  will  provide  a  net  benefit  to  the \neconomy  of  $105  million.14  The  sample  projects  under  the  SNIF  are  expected  to  generate \neconomic internal rates of return of around 13%, equivalent to earlier small-scale infrastructure \ninitiatives  supported  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners.15  Selected  projects  under  the \nSNIF  that  focus  on  infrastructure  and  investment  initiatives  are  expected  to  offer  substantial \nhigher  rates  of  economic  return.  To  ensure  its  financial  sustainability,  the  government  will \ncommit  an  annual  budget  allocation  to the  SNIF  based  on  the  national  budget  adopted  in  the \nprevious year, and defined as a percentage of recurrent revenue. The applied percentages are \n0.02%  for  2016,  0.04%  for  2017,  and  increasing  to  0.07%  in  2020.  The  expected  budget \nallocation will cover recurrent costs and provide an increasing contribution to the SNIF. On this \nbasis, implementation of the project is deemed financially sustainable.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nEfforts  to  reform  public  financial  management  have  produced  demonstrated  results.  A \nnew budget classification system and  chart of accounts have been implemented, and financial \nmanagement \ntreasuries  have  been \nstrengthened.16  To  improve  transparency  and  accountability,  reforms  have  been  initiated  to \nfocus  on:  program  budgeting;  linking  budgets  to  sector  policies,  outputs,  and  outcomes;  and, \nestablishing  ministries  as  budget  entities  \u2013granting  further  discretion  over  their  resources  and \nthus  facilitating  decentralization.  While  improvements  in  Cambodia\u2019s  procurement  system  are \nnoted,  domestically  financed  procurement  through  noncompetitive  and  informal  procedures \nremains common. Implementing regulations for the Public Procurement Law are being finalized \nand  the  government  has  undertaken  procurement  capacity  development  for  subnational \nadministrations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and the NCDD-S and the MEF. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nC. \n \n29. \nSubnational  democratic  development  through  decentralization  is  expected  to  assist \npoverty  reduction  in  Cambodia.    As  more  public  services  are  delegated  to  local  communities, \nconstituents  will  benefit  from  a  more  efficient  matching  of  local  preferences  and  expenditure \ndecisions.  These  arrangements  will  create  more  business  opportunities  for  local  suppliers  to \nexpand their businesses, providing positive impacts on the local economy and reducing poverty. \nStakeholders  will  also  benefit  from  the  increased  social  accountability  which  arises  from \nparticipatory planning and budgeting by subnational administrations.  \n \n30. \nGender  and  subnational  democratic  development.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  as \neffective  gender  mainstreaming  under  current  ADB  gender  mainstreaming  guidelines.  The \nprogram  mainstreams  gender  in  strategic  plans  and  supports  the  development  of  regulations \nthat  apply  quotas  and  targets  for  female  employment  in  civil  service.  The  decentralization  of \npriority  services  such  as  health  and  rural  water  supply  is  accompanied  by  the  adoption  of \ntargets for training local female counselors and local civil service, as well as the recruitment of \nfemale  coaches  and  provincial  advisers.  Finally,  the  gender  action  plan  aims  to  ensure  that:  \n                                                \n14 See revised Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  External  Advisory  Panel.  2015.

Nevertheless,  the  project  has  adopted  clear  screening  criteria  to \nproactively identify and prevent risks arising from involuntary resettlement and negative impacts \non  indigenous  peoples  in accordance  with ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Further, \nthe project design ensures that there will be adequate capacity in the SNIF Secretariat to screen \nthe  projects.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  and  C  for  social \nsafeguards. There will be no land acquisition associated  with implementation of projects under \nthe SNIF, as local investment project works are restricted to existing government land that will \nhave clear titles and be free of encumbrances. These lands will not be occupied or productively \nused  by  legal  or  non-titled  occupants.  A  monitoring  and  grievance  redress  mechanism  will \nmediate any unexpected impacts. \n \n32. \nThe  SNIF  Secretariat  will  review  proposed  local  investment  projects  to  ensure  they \nobserve  safeguard  categorization.  Review  and  field  visits  will  confirm  that  environmental \nimplications are limited. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been \nattached  to  the  PAM  and  establishes  rules,  procedures,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  be \nundertaken  to  identify,  monitor,  and  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts  due to  small  civil \nworks  activities  \u2013the  expected  value  of  each  project  will  not  exceed  $100,000.  The  EARF \nestablishes procedures for all local investment projects financed by the SNIF in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  government\u2019s  legislation  on  environmental \nmanagement.  These  procedures  will  guide  project  selection,  screening  and  categorization, \nenvironmental assessment, and preparation and implementation of environmental management \nplans  (EMPs)  of  selected  projects.  The  guidelines  under  the  EARF  include  a  construction  site \nchecklist,  environmental  design  criteria,  and  standardized  environmental  management  plans. \nThe  guidelines  will  be  implemented  by  the  district  administrations  and  supported  by  the  SNIF \nSecretariat. Relevant documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The SNIF Secretariat will \nbuild the capacity of participating districts to assist with the identification and submission of the \nfirst  batch  of  projects.  The  SNIF  Secretariat  safeguards  specialist  will  support  capacity \ndevelopment for districts, and will provide backstopping to districts as they prepare their plans. \nAt  the  district  level,  the  district  engineer  will  be  the  focus  of  the  capacity  building  efforts  on \nenvironmental assessment. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n33.   Major risks include resistance to the devolution of functions by the national government. \nFunctional  assignments  may  translated  into  unfunded  mandates  through  a  lack  of  progress  in \nestablishing subnational own sources of revenue, delays in developing the ability of subnational \nadministrations  to  assume  newly  assigned  functions,  and  procurement  and  corruption  risks.18  \n\n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nThe program will address these risks through the establishment and implementation of the SNIF, \nwhich will provide subnational administrations with investment funds for local priorities. The use \nof  TA  resources  will  ensure  districts  and  municipalities  have  access  to  tax  revenues,  and  will \nensure provincial resource centers provide demand-driven, hands-on mentoring to districts and \ncommunes.  Proper  fiduciary  arrangements  including  procurement,  a  review  committee,  and \ninvestment audit are in place. Overall, unmitigated risk is considered medium to high but given \nthe  mitigation  measures,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  overweight  the \ncosts. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n34. \nThe government and the NCDD-S have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
