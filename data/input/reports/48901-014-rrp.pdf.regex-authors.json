THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ncompulsory convertible debentures (CCD) investment of up to the equivalent of $10,000,000 in \nIndian rupees to Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd; (ii) a proposed loan of up to $1,500,000 to \nAkay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd; (iii) a proposed loan of up to $2,000,000 to SpiceRich \nSeasonings Pvt Ltd; (iv) a proposed loan of up to $3,000,000 to Akay Flavours & Aromatics \n(Cambodia)  Pvt  Ltd;  and  (v)  proposed  administration  of  loans  of  up  to  $5,000,000, to  be \nprovided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategic Climate Fund,1 to Akay Flavours & \nAromatics (Cambodia) Pvt Ltd or a partner financial institution to be identified, for the Spice \nValue Chain Development Project in India and Cambodia.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd (Akay Flavours) and its affiliates (together with Akay \nFlavours, Akay), a leading high-value spice producer and exporter from India, approached ADB \nin November 2013 to seek financial support for its expansion plans in India and Cambodia. Akay \nwas found suitable for ADB assistance based on its solid operational and financial history, its \nexperience working with smallholder farmers as contract farmers, and its commitment to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. Akay\u2019s proposed project will help address significant challenges \nin the agriculture sector in India and Cambodia by supporting the inclusion of smallholder \nfarmers in the global spice value chain and thereby helping to lift them out of poverty, promoting \nclimate-resilient  farming  technologies,  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  between  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries. \n \n3.  Agricultural development is a key to eradicating poverty and creating conditions for \nsustainable and equitable growth in Asia, because more than 60% of the region\u2019s inhabitants \nrely  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods  (including  50%  in  India  and  60%  in  Cambodia).3 \nAgricultural investment has proven to be one of the most effective and lowest-cost strategies for \nreducing poverty and hunger;4 investment to improve the efficiency of agricultural inputs\u2014 \nincluding  land,  water,  power,  and  fertilizer\u2014is  also  one  of  the  most  cost-effective  climate \nchange adaptation investments, with important climate change mitigation benefits.5 \n \n4.  The private sector is expected to play a key role in developing the agriculture sector in \nADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  In  2012,  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department \nrecommended  that  agriculture  interventions  be  more  market  oriented  through  support  to \nphysical  and  institutional  links  to  markets  and  agribusiness.6 Through  contract  farming, \nagribusiness companies can link smallholder farmers to global markets, and at the same time \npromote farming technologies that are resilient to the potential future impacts of climate change. \n \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  Proposed CCD investment and loans will be provided in two phases.  \n3  ADB.  2013.

India  is  the  leading  producer,  consumer,  and  exporter  of  spices  in  the  world,  and \nproduces 28% of the world\u2019s spices.7 Historically a bulk spice commodity supplier, India is now \nbecoming an exporter of high-value spice products to cater to changes in global demand. High-\nvalue spice segments include oleoresins, seasonings, sterilized spices, and nutraceuticals.8 \nDemand for these products is expected to continue to grow at about 10% per year.9 At the same \ntime, spice farming in India remains dominated by smallholder farmers. This creates a challenge \nfor high-value spice exporters, which need to ensure quality and reliability of supply. Most \nspices are channeled through unorganized intermediaries, and only a few companies such as \nAkay have been able to work directly with farmers to secure procurement of raw materials.10 \n \n6.  Agriculture in Cambodia is also dominated by smallholder farmers. Rice farming still \nabsorbs 90% of total cultivated land, albeit typically for subsistence farming, with very low \nyields.11 There is a strong need to diversify agriculture, especially towards higher-value cash \ncrops, including spices. Most Cambodian farmers lack experience in spice farming and access \nto productivity-enhancing inputs, such as seeds, irrigation, and other agricultural technologies; \ntherefore, experienced and responsible agribusiness developers are needed to partner with \nsmallholder farmers to take full advantage of the potential for high-value spice farming. \n \n2.  Project Design \n7.  The project will support Akay\u2019s investments across the spice value chain, from climate-\nresilient and inclusive farming models to processing and export of high-value spice products. \nThe project will be developed in two phases. In phase 1, starting in FY2015 and with a total \nproject cost of up to $10.4 million, Akay will invest in the following subprojects: \n(i)  Sterilized spices (India). In response to the global demand for sterilized ground \nspices, Akay has commissioned a new steam sterilization plant in Kerala. The \ncompany now needs to invest permanent working capital of up to $3.5 million to \nexpand production. This new business will help increase the quantity of spices \nsourced from contract farmers in India. Akay has been engaged in contract \nfarming with approximately 3,000 chili farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. \nAkay trains farmers in integrated crop management to improve both crop quality \nand yields, and then guarantees to purchase their produce. As of FY2014, Akay \nmeets 35% of its raw material needs through contract farming. \n(ii)  Nutraceuticals (India). Akay has been developing spice-based products that \nprovide health benefits. The company has already filed six patents in India and \nthree in the United States. To support the sales of both generic and patented \nnutraceuticals, the company will invest up to $3.8 million to expand research and \ndevelopment activities and its existing nutraceuticals production plant in Kerala. \n(iii)  Organic  farming  (Cambodia). With  the  objective  of  diversifying  Akay\u2019s  raw \nmaterial supply base, Akay\u2019s sponsors purchased 717 hectares of underutilized \nfarmland in the Battambang Province in FY2009 to build a model organic farm.12 \nInvestment of up to $3.1 million is needed on the farm to (i) increase the capacity \nof rainwater harvesting infrastructure, (ii) introduce drip irrigation systems, (iii) \n                                                \n7  Chili, turmeric, and cumin are the key spices being exported. \n8  Oleoresins are liquid preparations of resins and oils, obtained by extraction from plants. Oleoresins are used for \nprocessed food flavoring and coloring. Nutraceuticals are products derived from food that provide health benefits. \n9  Bharat Book Bureau. 2013.

The farm \nis expected to meet 10% of Akay\u2019s total raw material needs by FY2018. \n \n8.  Phase 2 will begin after 31 March 2015, subject to satisfactory performance in Phase 1 \nimplementation and ADB\u2019s Investment Committee endorsement. The total phase 2 project cost \nwill be $18.6 million, with Akay investing in the following subprojects:  \n(i)  Seasonings (India). Akay will invest up to $5.4 million to develop a processing \nplant and a marketing and distribution network for seasonings products. Akay\u2019s \nseasonings  products  will  primarily  serve  Indian  clients.  The  new  seasonings \nbusiness along with the growth of other segments will support the expansion of \ncontract farming in India to at least 6,000 farmers in FY2018, who are expected \nto provide 60% of Akay\u2019s total raw material needs during the same year. \n(ii)  Oleoresins (Cambodia). Akay plans to develop an oleoresin extraction plant in \nCambodia to process spices locally for export. The plant will be located in a \nspecial economic zone in either Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville. The plant\u2019s cost \nwill be up to $8.2 million. Raw spices will primarily be sourced from Akay\u2019s model \nfarm in Battambang and from new contract farmers located around the farm. \n(iii)  Climate-resilient contract farming (Cambodia). A concessional loan from the \nADB Strategic Climate Fund is being sought to support implementation of the \ncontract farming model in Cambodia.13 Under a proposed credit facility of up to \n$4.0 million, ADB will administer a loan to Akay, or a partner financial institution \nto be identified, and funds will be onlent to contract farmers around the farm to \ninvest in climate-resilient farming technologies, including rainwater harvesting \ninfrastructure and drip irrigation equipment.14 The Strategic Climate Fund will \nalso lend up to $1.0 million to Akay to support similar investments on the model \nfarm, which will be the training ground for the spice farmers. Akay is expected to \nreach out to 2,000 smallholder farmers by FY2018. \n \n3.  The Sponsor \n9.  Since its establishment in 1993, Akay has grown to one of the top five exporters of spice \noleoresins in the world. It is headquartered in Cochin, Kerala and operates five processing \nplants in India with total capacity of 42,000 tons of raw material per year. It has a distribution \nnetwork in 70 countries. Akay primarily exports to the United States, Europe, and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Exports constitute over 90% of its revenues.15 The company has been \nconsistently profitable over the past 3 years. \n \n10.  Akay is majority-owned by Alex Koshy, a Kerala-born entrepreneur. A. Koshy is not \ninvolved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  company,  and  Akay  is  run  by  a  qualified \nmanagement team led by the managing director (Balu Maliakel), who holds a doctorate in \nsynthetic organic chemistry and has more than 20 years of experience in the spice industry. \nAkay\u2019s core values center on social development, job creation, gender empowerment, and \nsustainability, as it engages with a large number of low-income farmers. It has enabled a village \n                                                \n13 Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Concept Note (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n14 Farms in the Battambang region are typically rain fed for 7\u20138 months a year, with irrigation used during the 4\u20135 \nmonth dry season. Using drip irrigation from harvested rainwater, farmers will be able to irrigate throughout the \nyear without extracting water from rivers, lakes, or groundwater reserves. This will deliver better crop yields, while \nprotecting against future potential impacts of climate change (mainly drought-induced crop failures). \n15 All of Akay\u2019s products meet global quality standards and comply with relevant regulations. The company follows \nstrong  internal  control  and  quality  assurance  procedures.  Its  products  are  compliant  with  the  International \nOrganization for Standardization ISO 9001:2000 standards, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point \ncertification from the British Standards Institution. ", "4  \nof about 8,000 people in Karnataka to become self-sufficient by promoting contract farming and \nbuilding a spice extraction plant to create local employment. In Cambodia, Akay employs local \nvillagers  on  the  model  farm  (30  on  a  permanent  basis,  and  200  seasonally),  and  has \nrehabilitated a 50-kilometer section of a poorly maintained public road that provides improved \naccess for the local population (footnote 12). \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impacts \n11.  The project will help sustain high value-added agriculture growth in India and Cambodia. \nIn India, the government targets an increase in the annual real growth rate of horticulture \nproduction (including spices) from 4.7% in FY2008\u2013FY2013 to 5.0% in FY2013\u2013FY2018.16 In \nCambodia, the project will contribute to an increase in the proportion of the agricultural gross \ndomestic product that comes from non-rice crops (including spices), from 50% in FY2012 to \n65% in FY2020. The project will promote regional integration, trade, and investment, particularly \nspice exports from India and Cambodia to the rest of Asia, and foreign direct investment in \nCambodia from the rest of Asia. \n \n12.  The project will also contribute to rural poverty reduction by including farmers in the \nglobal spice value chain. A socioeconomic survey of a sample of Akay\u2019s chili contract farmers in \nIndia found they earn 10% more per acre on average than other farmers. As a result, their per \ncapita  income  has  increased  from  $0.75  per  day  to  $1.31  per  day  (a  75%  increase)  in \nKarnataka over a 10-year engagement with Akay, and from $0.53 per day to $0.61 per day (a \n15% increase) in Andhra Pradesh after 1 year of engagement. A similar income growth rate \namong Battambang farmers in Cambodia will result in incomes rising from $1.17 per day to \n$1.35 per day, above the extreme poverty line of $1.25 per day.17 As such, the project is \nexpected to directly contribute to a reduction in rural poverty (as nationally defined) from 26.1% \nin FY2010 to 21.1% in FY2020 in Karnataka, from 21.1% in FY2010 to 16.1% in FY2020 in \nAndhra Pradesh (and Telangana), and from 20.0% in FY2010 to 15.0% in FY2020 in Cambodia. \n \n2.  Outcome \n13.  The project\u2019s expected outcome will be the increased production of value-added spice \nproducts, with raw materials sustainably sourced from an increased number of smallholder \nfarmers in India and Cambodia. The project is expected to benefit at least 5,000 contract \nfarmers in India and Cambodia by FY2018, and at least 50% of them are expected to be women \n(footnote 2). \n \n3.  Outputs \n14.  The outputs of the project are (i) the successful completion of phase 1 investments by 31 \nMarch 2016, and (ii) the successful completion of phase 2 investments by 31 March 2017.18 \n \n                                                \n16 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

A  similar  survey  will  be  conducted  following  project \nimplementation to confirm the project\u2019s poverty reduction impact. \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "    5\nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n15.  The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  emphasizes  food  security  and  agricultural \nproductivity, since food security is essential for poverty reduction, and investment in agriculture \nwill directly support food security. Agricultural investment will also boost rural employment as \nthe  agriculture  sector  remains  a  large  absorber  of  the  labor  force.  Further,  the  project  is \nconsistent with a number of other focus areas and themes highlighted in the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020 including supporting inclusive business, narrowing gender gaps, and scaling up \nsupport to climate adaptation.19 The project is also aligned with the relevant ADB country \npartnership  strategies  (CPSs).  Job  creation,  environmental  sustainability,  and  regional \nconnectivity are major thrusts of the India CPS, 2013\u20132017,20 while the current Cambodia CPS, \n2011\u20132013 calls for \u201cenhanced agricultural productivity and diversification.\u201d21 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n16.  The project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy. In particular, the \nOperational Plan for Sustainable Food Security, 2009 recommends an expanded partnership \nwith the private sector in order to attract more direct investments in agribusinesses. The project \nalso addresses the operational plan\u2019s objective of enhancing synergy and value addition in the \nlinkages along the food and agriculture value chains. Improved linkages along value chains \nenhance  productivity,  employment  opportunities,  exports  and  regional  trade,  but  also  food \nsecurity  for  the  poor  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.22 The  project  will  complement  ADB\u2019s \nsovereign assistance to agribusiness infrastructure and value chains in India and Cambodia.23 \n  \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n17.  The total project cost (phases 1 and 2) will be approximately $29.0 million and will be \nfinanced through the proposed $16.5 million assistance from ADB, $5.0 million assistance from \nthe ADB Strategic Climate Fund, $6.4 million from commercial banks, and $1.1 million from \nAkay\u2019s internally generated cash, as summarized in tables 1 and 2. \n \n   \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2014.

Phase 2 will be implemented in FY2016\u2013FY2017. \nConstruction  The goods and services required for the project will be procured based on transparent and \narrangements   competitive bidding processes from suppliers in ADB\u2019s member countries. \nOperations  The project will rely on Akay for its successful operation and maintenance. Akay successfully \narrangements  operates similar spice processing facilities. In Cambodia, Akay\u2019s subsidiary will enter into a long-\nterm land lease agreement with the sponsor company that owns the 717 ha of farm land. \nSupply  Akay sources raw materials through three channels: own-farm production (1%), contract farming \narrangements  (35%), and open trade market (64%). It aims to increase the proportion of its own-farm production \nto 10% and contract farming to 60% by FY2018. \nPerformance  Akay will report on key performance indicators, including the output and outcome indicators \nmonitoring  identified in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1, on a semiannual basis. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = financial year, ha = hectare. \nSource: Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd. \n \n \nF.  Unique Features \n19.  The  project  promotes  inclusive  and  climate-resilient  agricultural  value  chains.  The \ncontract farming model will benefit smallholder farmers through increased income-generating ", "    7\npotential from growing high-value crops. The innovative drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting \nsystems will increase farmers\u2019 income security by reducing the risk from drought. The project is \nalso a very good example of direct cooperation between developing countries through the \ntransfer of knowledge in high-value spice farming and processing from India to Cambodia. It is \nADB\u2019s first nonsovereign climate adaptation project and first regional agribusiness project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  ADB will subscribe to CCDs in Akay Flavours in Indian rupees, in an amount up to the \nequivalent of $6.0 million for phase 1 and $4.0 million for phase 2. The instrument has been \nstructured to address Akay\u2019s capital needs. It provides growth capital with limited debt service \nobligations in the short term, while the asset base is being expanded. At the same time, it will \nenable ADB to share in the benefits from a potential initial public offering (IPO) or a potential \nstrategic sale.  \n \n21.  ADB will also provide senior secured US dollar-denominated loans to Akay. To support \nphase 1, ADB will lend up to $1.5 million to Akay Flavours to fund the nutraceuticals plant \nexpansion in India. For phase 2, ADB will lend (i) up to $2.0 million to SpiceRich Seasonings\u2014a \n100% subsidiary of Akay Flavours\u2014to fund the seasonings plant in India; and (ii) up to $3.0 \nmillion to Akay Flavours & Aromatics (Cambodia)\u2014a subsidiary of Akay Flavours, which is to be \nincorporated\u2014to fund the oleoresin extraction plant in Cambodia. \n \n22.  Finally, ADB will administer loans from the ADB Strategic Climate Fund to Akay Flavours \nfor (i) investing in rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation infrastructure on the model farm ($1 \nmillion), and (ii) setting up a credit facility for contract farmers to invest in similar climate-resilient \nfarming technologies ($4 million). These loans will rank pari passu with ADB\u2019s loans. The loan of \nup to $4 million for the credit facility may also be provided to a partner financial institution, with \nAkay sharing some of the contract farmers\u2019 credit risk through first-loss guarantee, for example. \nThe  final  structure  of  the  credit  facility  for  contract  farmers  will  be  endorsed  by  ADB\u2019s \nInvestment Committee and the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) subcommittee, \nfollowing the approval  of the ADB Board of Directors sought herein.24 \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB assistance will support the development of a uniquely inclusive business model of \nincluding low-income farmers in the global spice value chain and providing them with additional \nincome and climate-resilient farming technologies. ADB assistance will help demonstrate the \nsustainability  of  this  business  model  and  ensure  its  replicability.  To  ensure  a  successful \nimplementation of the project, ADB will provide long-term financing and growth capital, which is \nextremely scarce in Cambodia, and not readily available in this sector in India. ADB will also \nmobilize concessional funds through the ADB Strategic Climate Fund to provide financing to \nAkay's contract farmers in Cambodia, who have limited access to commercial finance.  \n \n                                                \n24 The PPCR subcommittee (https://climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/node/65) has already approved the Pilot Program \nfor Climate Resilience Concept Note for the project (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "8  \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n31.  The financing of the project is considered as corporate finance in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  subprojects  are  classified  as  category  B  for  the \nenvironment, which are likely to have low to medium environmental impacts and risks during \nconstruction and operation. An initial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared for \nthe identified subprojects.25 The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. All subprojects will be located on the land owned or leased by Akay. \nThe  land  in  India  and  Cambodia  has  been  acquired  through  negotiated  settlement.  The \ncompensation was consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and there \nare no pending grievances, as confirmed by the social compliance audit. No subproject will \nentail further land acquisition resulting in involuntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous \npeoples communities. All existing lands to be used for subprojects using ADB funds are free of \nany  encumbrances,  including  the  717  hectares  of  farmland  in  Cambodia.  The  project  is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming.26 Akay will comply with the national labor laws \nand take measures to comply with the relevant international core labor standards. \n \n32.  Akay will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) satisfactory to \nADB before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. To ensure adequate implementation of its ESMS and of \nthe environmental management plan included in the IEE, Akay has agreed to establish a safety \ncommittee with representatives from all plants, and to train its management and environmental \nand  social  team.  Akay  is  committed  to  enhancing  its  current  procedures  and  will  submit \nsemiannual  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  on  implementation  of  its  ESMS  and  environmental \nmanagement plan, including corrective actions. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n33.  Akay was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  finance  and  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n34.  The proposed CCD investment and loans are within the medium-term, country, industry, \nand group exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. The proposed loans are within the \nsingle obligor limit for loans. However, ADB\u2019s proposed CCD investment in Akay Flavours & \nAromatics will represent up to 50% of the company\u2019s net worth, which breaches the equity \ninvestment limit. Furthermore, the combined total amount of ADB\u2019s proposed CCD investment \nand its proposed loans also breaches the aggregate financing limit.27 As a result, waivers are \n                                                \n25 The IEE of the Cambodia oleoresin extraction plant will be updated following ADB Board approval in accordance \nwith the agreed environmental and social management system since the subproject location has not been finalized. \n26 A gender action plan has been prepared to (i) increase women\u2019s participation in new contract farming in Cambodia \nand India, (ii) improve facilities and opportunities for women farmers engaged in Akay farms, (iii) enhance capacity \nof Akay to target and train women farmers and workers, (iv) improve women\u2019s financial inclusion and management, \nand (v) improve monitoring and reporting on gender issues. \n27 ADB. 2009. Review of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Exposure Limits on Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. The \nBoard policy establishes a single obligor limit for equity investments such that equity investments shall not exceed \nthe lower of (i) $75 million and (ii) an amount equal to 25% of the net worth of the investee company. As for the ", "    9\nsought for both the single obligor limit and the aggregate financing limit. It should be noted that \nin the event of conversion of the CCD, ADB\u2019s shareholding would be less than 25% of the \nshares of the company and ADB would not hold a controlling stake in the company. It would \nalso not be the single largest shareholder in the company. \n \nD.  Assurances \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India and the Government of Cambodia will be requested to confirm that they \nhave no objection to the proposed assistance to Akay. ADB will enter into suitable finance and \ninvestment documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed assistance would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the compulsory convertible debentures investment of up to the equivalent of \n$10,000,000 in Indian rupees to Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd; \n(ii)  the loan of up to $1,500,000 to Akay Flavours & Aromatics Pvt Ltd; \n(iii)  the loan of up to $2,000,000 to SpiceRich Seasonings Pvt Ltd; \n(iv)  the loan of up to $3,000,000 to Akay Flavours & Aromatics (Cambodia) Pvt Ltd; \nand \n(v)  administration of loans of up to $5,000,000 to be provided by the ADB Strategic \nClimate Fund to Akay Flavours & Aromatics (Cambodia) Pvt Ltd or a partner \nfinancial  institution  to  be  identified  for  the  Spice  Value  Chain  Development \nProject in India and Cambodia \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n37.  I also recommend that the Board approve the waiver of the single exposure limit for \nequity investment and the aggregate financing limit as specified in para. 34. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n14 August 2014\n                                                                                                                                                       \naggregate amount, it provides that the amount of ADB\u2019s total financing under equity, debt and guarantee \ninstruments shall not exceed 25% of total assets of the company.
