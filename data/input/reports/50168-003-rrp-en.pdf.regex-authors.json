THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 3 of the Fiscal and Public Expenditure \nManagement Program (FPEMP). \n \n2.  FPEMP is a key pillar of Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to the government\u2019s \nfocus on reducing poverty and household income inequality. It supports critical fiscal and public \nexpenditure management (PEM) reforms to improve the quality of government spending on \nhealth, education, social protection, and infrastructure. It is consistent with the government\u2019s \nreform  priorities  to  (i)  align  medium-term  expenditure  with  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019 (RPJMN)1 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); (ii) \ncomplete  the  national  public  expenditure  framework;  and  (iii)  improve  fiscal  transfers  and \nspending of subnational governments.2 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132019.3 Subprogram 3 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \n2019\u20132021 for Indonesia.4 The proposed subprogram is aligned with the operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to (i) strengthen governance and institutional capacity (operational priority \n6), (ii) accelerate progress on gender equality (operational priority 2), and (iii) mainstream climate \nin national development plans (operational priority 3).5  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. FPEMP uses a programmatic approach, \nwhich aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program over a medium- to long-term \nhorizon. The ADB Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach, comprising three \nsubprograms, and subprogram 1 in September 2016. Subprogram 1, totaling $500 million and \nconsisting of 12 policy actions, mapped the government\u2019s medium-term expenditure with the \nRPJMN and SDGs and improved national and subnational PEM.6 Subprogram 2, totaling $500 \nmillion and comprising 13 policy actions, was approved in June 2018.7 It supported reforms linking \nspending  with  targets  under  the  RPJMN  and  SDGs,  and  strengthened  PEM  reforms  by \nsynchronizing planning with the budget cycle. All completed policy actions in subprograms 1 and \n2 have been maintained, with no reversals. The focus of subprogram 3 is on (i) implementing \nSDG-related reforms, including climate mainstreaming, social assistance, and labor market \nactivation  programs;  and  (ii)  making  fiscal  transfers  to  subnational  governments  more \nperformance-based. The inclusion of the post-program partnership framework (P3F), 2020\u20132025 \nwill enable ADB to continue supporting reforms in these areas and provide a platform to support \nthe government\u2019s focus on human capital development.  \n \n1  National Development Planning Agency. 2014.

Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average \nannual rate of 5.0% between 2014-2018, continuing a strong economic expansion since the Asian \nFinancial Crisis of 1997-98.8 The government has maintained a prudent fiscal stance, with deficits \nbelow the statutory limit of 3.0% of GDP and debt estimated at 30.0% of GDP in 2018. Inflation \nmoderated from 6.4% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2018 and is expected to remain subdued. As of 2017, \nall three major credit rating agencies put Indonesia's sovereign credit rating at investment grade \ndue to strong growth prospects, supportive macroeconomic policy, and structural reform agenda. \nHowever, the current account has remained in deficit since 2012, with reliance on portfolio capital \nflows for its financing, which exposes the country to external uncertainties.  \n \n5.  Development problem. The proposed subprogram 3 comes at a critical juncture for \nIndonesia. It is designed to maintain the momentum of its development efforts at a time when the \nquality of public spending is critical to realize development outcomes under the RPJMN and \nSDGs. Since 2015, the government has made substantial progress in terms of increased and \nbetter targeted public spending on SDG-related sectors such as infrastructure, health, education, \nand social protection. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, improved from 0.41 \nin 2014 to 0.39 in 2016 at the beginning of subprogram 2, and 0.38 in 2019. Moreover, the national \npoverty rate declined from 11.3% in 2014 to 9.4% in 2019. However, several development \nindicators still lag behind the established targets. The Gini coefficient remains higher than the \ntarget of 0.36 in the RPJMN, with inequality of opportunity a key challenge. The poverty rate has \nnot met the target of 7.0%\ua7f78.0% set in the RPJMN. About 20.8% of the total population, or 56 \nmillion people, are clustered marginally above the poverty line (Rp361,496 per month in 2017).9 \nThese people are vulnerable to economic shocks such as natural disasters and fluctuations in \nfood and commodity prices, which erode their ability to earn incomes, and are at risk of being \npulled back into poverty.10 While the unemployment rate declined to 5.0% in 2019 from 6.2% in \n2015, job growth is predominantly in low-productivity, low-wage informal sectors. In 2019, 22.6% \nof youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET), and the proportion is higher among \nyoung women (28.7%).11 Those categorized as NEET tend to come from low-income families and \nface job entry barriers, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality. \n \n6.  Increased investment in people and regional development needed. Recognizing the \nneed to optimize fiscal spending for inclusive growth and development, the government has \nstrengthened its fiscal policy framework and decentralization efforts to improve the quality of \nspending and service delivery, with emphasis on the poorest 40% of households. The energy \nsubsidy reform in 2015 has resulted in a substantial reduction of budget allocation for energy \nsubsidies. In the 2019 State Budget, the budget allocation for energy subsidies amounted to $9.9 \nbillion (Rp140.3 trillion)\u2014less than half of $25.6 billion (Rp362 trillion) in 2014 (Figure). This \nreform, coupled with tax administration reforms, created fiscal space for increased pro-poor \nspending, especially in infrastructure and social protection programs. During subprogram 2 \n(2018), despite lower fiscal deficits, budget allocations were increased as follows: (i) education, \nfrom $26.2 billion to $30.8 billion; (ii) health, from $6.5 billion to $7.6 billion; (iii) social protection, \nfrom $9.8 billion to $11.4 billion; and (iv) infrastructure, from $19.0 billion to $29.0 billion. However, \nto reach the government\u2019s Gini coefficient target of 0.36, reduce the poverty rate further, and meet \nthe various SDG targets, stronger economic and fiscal performance as well as continuous \ntargeted spending on education, health, infrastructure, and social protection programs will be \n \n8  ADB forecasts growth of 5.1% for 2019 and 5.2% for 2020, with external uncertainty a key risk to the outlook. \n9  World Bank. 2019.

Binding constraints. The government has identified the challenges it needs to address \nto meet its RPJMN and SDG targets.12 They include (i) insufficient implementation of the medium-\nterm framework and SDG programs, (ii) incomplete national public expenditure management, and \n(iii) fiscal transfers to subnational governments that are not performance-based. \n \n8.  Insufficient  implementation  of  the  medium-term  framework  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal programs. Aligning the medium-term expenditures with the RPJMN and \nSDG targets is a work in progress. Under subprogram 2 (footnote 7), the National Coordination \nTeam for SDGs, chaired by the President of Indonesia, was established. The team is mandated \nto undertake coordination, planning, monitoring, and reporting on SDG implementation, using a \nunified results framework, including mapping the SDGs against RPJMN targets. Despite progress, \nseveral constraints must be overcome to fully integrate the national development agenda into the \nexisting medium-term framework. First, although the government has issued a national SDG \naction plan, the absence of financing, gender and climate mainstreaming strategies, and regional \naction plans, hampers SDG implementation. Consequently, the government\u2019s SDG priorities have \nnot been fully translated into actions at the national line agencies and subnational governments. \nSecond, the difficulty in meeting the SDG targets is reflected in the ad hoc implementation of \nsocial assistance and labor market activation programs to address poverty, inequality, and \nunemployment. Despite the focus on social assistance programs, implementation is often on a \nper program basis, making the programs less efficient and effective. Similarly, labor market \nactivation programs are in their infancy and do not specifically target youth and girls to shorten \nthe school-to-work transition.  \n \n9.  Incomplete national public expenditure management framework. Although important \nprogress has been made during earlier subprograms (footnotes 6 and 7), the national public \n \n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n ", "4 \nexpenditure framework is still incomplete, which weakens the quality and efficiency of public \nservice delivery, ultimately undermining development outcomes. The constraints are (i) lack of \ndetailed operating guidance for the use of multiyear contracts, (ii) the absence of legal certainty \nfor the Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy Framework (KEMPPKF), and (iii) underutilization of the \nunified planning and budget system (KRISNA). The 2018 Presidential Regulation on Public \nProcurement of Goods and Services issued under subprogram 2 is an important milestone to \nimprove the efficiency of public procurement. The regulation aimed to address issues of multiple \nprocurement contracts and delayed disbursements, especially capital expenditure through the \nimplementation of multiyear contracts. However, this implementation is limited until the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) issues the implementing regulations, including defining the approval threshold \nfor multiyear contracts. Similarly, the KEMPPKF, which provides the framework to synchronize \nbudget preparation with the medium-term expenditure framework, is based on internal guidelines \nand lacks legal certainty. This reduces the accountability of the budget process. Finally, although \nthe KRISNA system was launched for the preparation of the 2018 budget under subprogram 2, \nthe system has not been fully utilized to review budget allocation, including for national priorities \nsuch as climate change and gender mainstreaming.  \n \n10.  Fiscal  transfers  to  subnational  governments  are  not  performance-based. \nIntergovernmental fiscal transfer mechanisms are an integral part of fiscal decentralization and \nhave  seen  important  improvements  during  subprograms  1  and  2. 13  Under  the  earlier \nsubprograms,  the  channels  for  fiscal  transfers  were  expanded  and  allocation  increased \nsignificantly. The government also introduced reporting requirements to increase accountability \nof subnational government spending. However, the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system has \nnot addressed widening regional disparities as it is not performance-based. For example, in 2018 \nthe per capita income in Jakarta is about $17,571 (Rp248 million), almost 14 times higher than in \nEast Nusa Tenggara. Three constraints are present. First, no systematic procedures are in place \nin the disbursement of the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) to synchronize activities across sectors \nand line ministries to avoid overlapping results. Second, the methodology for allocation of the \nVillage Fund is generic and does not consider the different levels of development among villages, \nthus failing to address regional disparity. Third, although the performance indicators of the \nRegional Incentive Fund (DID) have been refined, they are still not directly linked to SDG targets \nsuch as reducing stunting and maternal mortality rates. These constraints have led to delays in \ndisbursement and inefficiencies in subnational government spending.  \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s medium-term strategy is to create \nsustainable and equitable economic growth by optimizing revenue, improving spending quality, \nreorienting subsidy schemes to targeted social assistance programs, and decentralizing fiscal \nauthority.  Together  with  the  commitment  to  increase  spending  in  pro-poor  sectors,  the \ngovernment is also increasing the quality of expenditure through PEM reforms. On the revenue \nside, Indonesia seeks to increase its tax-GDP ratio from about 10.0% in 2016 to 12.7%\u201313.3% \nby  2021,  eventually  reaching  15%.  To  achieve  this,  the  government  implemented  tax \nadministration reforms, including broadening the coverage of taxpayers. The reforms contributed \n \n13 The main channels of intergovernmental fiscal transfers in Indonesia are (i) the General Allocation Fund to support \nrecurring spending; (ii) the Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) for specific investment expenditures aligned with national \npriorities; (iii) the Revenue-Sharing Fund, which covers natural resources; and (iv) the Regional Incentive Fund (DID), \nwhich provides an incentive to subnational governments to improve their performance. In addition, a fifth channel, \nthe Village Fund, was introduced in 2015 to help the lowest level of governments finance development. \n \n ", "5 \nto increased tax collection of about $7 billion, equivalent to a tax-GDP ratio of 11.5%, in 2018. \nThe government is committed to sustain these reforms with support from development partners.  \n \n12.  Reform  accomplishments.  At  the  inception  of  the  programmatic  approach,  the \ngovernment agreed to accomplish six prior actions (triggers) and seven policy milestones as the \nbasis for subprogram 3.14 During the processing of subprogram 3, three prior actions (2, 7, and \n11) were strengthened to enhance their legal status and improve the governance of DAK fiscal \ntransfer. Subprogram 3 comprises 13 policy actions, all of which have been accomplished. \n \n13.  Medium-term expenditure aligned with National Medium-Term Development Plan \nand Sustainable Development Goal targets. This reform area supports SDG 3 (good health), \nSDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work), and SDG 13 (climate \naction). The reforms also build on accomplishments under subprograms 1 and 2, including the \nissuance and implementation of presidential regulations on SDGs, which established the National \nCoordination Team for SDGs. There were four key accomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the \ngovernment  launched  the  SDG  road  map,  which  included  a  financing  chapter  for  SDG \nimplementation. This is critical, as the financing chapter assessed the costs of the various SDG \nprograms, available government resources, and innovative means to crowd in private sector \nfinancing. Climate change mitigation and adaptation, and gender mainstreaming strategies, \nincluding  sex-disaggregated  data,  were  also  incorporated  in  the  road  map.  Second,  the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to SDGs is reflected in its increased budget allocation for pro-poor \nexpenditure. From 2018 to 2019, budget allocations have increased as follows: (i) education, from \n$30.8 billion to $34.9 billion; (ii) health, from $7.6 billion to $8.7 billion; (iii) social protection from \n$11.4 billion to $14.2 billion; and (iv) infrastructure from $29.0 billion to $29.4 billion.15 \n \n14.  Third, supplementing the budget increase, the government enhanced the efficiency and \ntargeting of its social assistance programs by combining the food assistance and conditional cash \ntransfer (PKH) programs into one smart card. The food assistance program, pilot tested during \nsubprogram 1 and extended to 1.4 million households during subprogram 2, has been expanded \nto 15.6 million households. The government also doubled the amount of benefit for the 10 million \nhouseholds of the PKH from Rp1.2 million in 2016 to Rp2.4 million in 2019. In addition, the benefit \nstructure of the PKH was improved from a flat annual rate to a basic assistance rate, with \nadditional benefits added according to family conditions such as the presence of pregnant women, \nchildren  under  five,  elderly,  and  family  members  with  disabilities.  The  National  Team  for \nAcceleration of Poverty Reduction estimated that reforms in the social assistance programs have \nthe potential to bring the national poverty rate down to about 6% and reduce the Gini coefficient \nto 0.376.16 Analysis of the shift from the rice subsidy program to noncash social assistance \nshowed that inclusion of poor households in the bottom 25% improved by 3% in 2018, and \ninclusion of non-targeted households decreased from 9% in 2017 to 5% in 2018. Finally, to \naddress youth unemployment and enhance human capital development through skills upgrade of \nemployees, the government pilot tested several labor market activation programs, including \nvocational training facilities for religious schools and skills development centers to inform the \n \n14 Prior actions are considered to be loan disbursement conditions, and policy milestones strengthen the program. A \ncomparison of the original and the revised subprogram 3 reform actions is in Summary Assessment of Policy Actions \nUnder Subprogram 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 During subprogram 3 (from April 2018 to August 2019), the budget allocation for education, health, social assistance, \nand infrastructure had a real increase of 5.6% on an aggregate basis. \n16 The National Team for The Acceleration of Poverty Reduction. 2018.

National public expenditure framework completed. This reform area contributes to the \nimplementation of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). It aims to strengthen the \nalignment  of  budget  planning  with  the  medium-term  fiscal  objectives  and  to  address  the \nbottlenecks of state budget disbursement, by providing greater control over and flexibility of public \nexpenditures. The reforms also build on accomplishments under subprograms 1 and 2, including \nimproved budget transparency, issuance of presidential regulations on multiyear contracts, and \ndevelopment of the KRISNA system for coherence between planning of national priorities and \nbudgeting. In subprogram 3, reforms were undertaken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness \nof public spending. First, more efficient disbursement of capital expenditures by line ministries \nwas achieved with the issuance of implementing rules and regulations for multiyear contracts by \nthe MOF and National Public Procurement Agency. The regulation provided flexibility and enabled \nline ministries to approve their own multiyear contracts of up to $14 million for construction work \nand $1.4 million for the procurement of goods and services. Flexibility is also provided, so that \nline ministries can request to extend the duration and increase the ceiling of the multiyear \ncontracts, as well as reallocate the composition within the contract.  \n \n16.  Second, efficiency, disbursement, and financial reporting at the spending unit level was \nenhanced through automated payment and online monitoring of financial management. To \nachieve this, the MOF integrated the features of electronic budget requests and payment into one \napplication and expanded its use from 322 spending units in 2018 to more than 1,000 spending \nunits in 2019. Third, the government strengthened the effectiveness of the budget process with \nthe  full  implementation  of  KRISNA  in  the  MOF,  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS), all line ministries, and subnational governments to prepare the 2019 budget. \nKRISNA was also used to review gender-responsive and climate adaptation allocations in the \n2019 budget, which strengthened linkage with national priorities. The government also enhanced \nthe medium- to long-term effectiveness of public spending by including the long-term fiscal \nsustainability assessment and framework (up to 2045) as part of the KEMPPKF. This enabled the \ngovernment to plan its long-term fiscal commitment to include factors such as demographic \ntransition and long-term contingent liabilities. Further, the accountability of the KEMPPKF was \nimproved with the upgrade of its legal status to ministerial decree. \n \n17.  Fiscal  transfers  and  subnational  governments\u2019  spending  for  service  delivery \nimproved. This reform area strengthened the PEM of subnational governments. These reforms \ncut  across  several  SDGs  at  the  subnational  level,  including  good  health  (SDG  3),  quality \neducation (SDG 4), and infrastructure (SDG 9). The reforms build on accomplishments under \nsubprograms 1 and 2, including increased and more targeted intergovernmental fiscal transfers, \nand the introduction of a compliance mechanism to strengthen monitoring and disbursements. \nThere were three key accomplishments in subprogram 3. First, the government increased budget \nallocations for the Village Fund from Rp60 trillion in 2018 to Rp70 trillion in 2019, and reformulated \nallocations toward poor and lagging villages.18 Subsequent disbursements of the Village Fund are \nperformance-based and subject to implementation progress. \n \n17 ADB. 2015.

Manila; and Skillnet Ireland. https://www.skillnetireland.ie/. \n18 The basic allocation, which provides uniform budget allocation to each village, was reduced to 72% in 2019 from \n90% in 2017. The formula allocation, which depends on various characteristics of villages, including poverty rates, \nwas increased to 25% in 2019 from 10% in 2017. The government also introduced affirmative allocation, which \nprovides additional allocations to villages in the three poorest income deciles, accounting for 3% of total allocations. \n ", "7 \n18.  Second, the government implemented reforms to enhance the efficiency and governance \nof DAK for local infrastructure. Subnational governments were required to utilize KRISNA to \nsynchronize programs, projects, and activities to avoid overlapping end results across sectors, \nline ministries, and subnational governments. The disbursements of DAK are also conditional on \nproject performance. An independent internal control body, which reports directly to the city \nmayor, was introduced to undertake an oversight role in DAK utilization and disbursements. \nThese reforms improved budget absorption of the subnational governments from 84.2% in 2017 \nto 88.1% in 2018. Third, the government continued to increase DID transfers from Rp8.5 trillion \nin 2018 to Rp10 trillion in 2019 and strengthened the linkages between DID allocations and SDG \noutcomes. In 2019, the criteria for DID allocations included SDG-related performance indicators \nsuch as: (i) infant immunization, (ii) childbirth receiving professional services at medical facilities, \n(iii) reduced incidence of stunting, and (iv) climate-resilient infrastructure. This is critical to \nincentivize subnational governments to implement programs to meet the SDGs.  \n \n19.  Post-program partnership framework. The P3F provides for a structured dialogue in \nthe medium term and represents ADB\u2019s commitment to continue supporting the government\u2019s \nSDG reform agenda via technical assistance (TA).19 Through the FPEMP, the government has \ndeveloped the SDG implementation framework and has implemented reforms to improve the \nquality of spending through PEM reforms in the national and subnational governments. These \nreforms enabled the government to focus on implementing SDG initiatives to address inequality \nof opportunity. The P3F reflects the government\u2019s commitment to sustain reform and will enable \nADB to support specific initiatives including the conditional cash transfer program and programs \nto address unemployment. Key activities include implementing labor market activation programs \nto address youth unemployment and skills development, and better targeting the conditional cash \ntransfer program. This may lead to a new program to support the government\u2019s focus on human \ncapital development.  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has supported reforms in PEM and social assistance programs \nby recognizing the need for a building block approach in the medium term. In 2001, ADB provided \nTA to set up the public financial management and PEM framework at the national and subnational \nlevels.20 This was followed by support for the government to build a modern national public \nfinancial management system, including a public debt management office, in 2005.21 In the \nsecond phase, ADB provided support to introduce financial management information systems in \n147 local governments and to decentralize the tax framework.22 Since 2012, ADB has provided \nTA to improve the fiscal sustainability of social security, strengthen the fiscal decentralization \nframework, and improve fiscal risk management of contingent liabilities arising from accelerated \ninfrastructure investment. ADB also supported the government\u2019s reform agenda to improve its \ninvestment climate, develop the capital market, and improve access to finance.23 \n \n19 ADB. 2016.

ADB\u2019s experience, particularly through its support of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, provided three key lessons that have been incorporated in the program \ndesign.24 First, PEM reforms are successful when they are linked to a country\u2019s commitment to \ninternational goals. The program linked reforms to SDGs. Such linkage provided an overarching \nframework for these reforms and obtained high-level commitment from the government. Second, \nADB learned that meeting SDG targets requires implementing reform programs at the subnational \nlevel.25 Implementation can be made more effective by providing an incentive framework for local \ngovernments to meet SDG indicators. This program linked DID to indicators on stunting and \nmaternal mortality. Third, gender mainstreaming reforms, including the determination of sex-\ndisaggregated indicators, should be integrated in the national strategy and action plan. The \nprogram incorporated gender mainstreaming in the SDGs road map and regional action plans.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  program  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government helped prioritize and sequence \nlegal, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms. ADB\u2019s value addition spans all three reform \nareas. In the area of SDG implementation, ADB supported development of the SDGs Roadmap \nwhich included the financing chapter and integrated gender mainstreaming strategy (footnote 19). \nThe Roadmap estimated that Indonesia needs to spend over $700 billion for SDG-related \nprograms from 2020 to 2030 and provided the strategy for the government to finance this including \nthrough private sector financing. In addition, ADB began pilot testing labor market activation \nprograms for youth unemployment and skills upgrades, based on experience from successful \nimplementation of similar programs in the Philippines such as the JobStart program (footnote 17). \nIn the area of national PEM reforms, ADB provided support for the government to draft the long-\nterm fiscal framework report, which was attached to the KEMPPKF. The 2019 budget benefited \nfrom such analysis. ADB also improved governance by supporting capacity development of \ngovernment  internal  auditors  and  public  finance  officers.26 At  the  subnational  level,  ADB \nsupported capacity building for PKH supervisors on case management, complaints handling, and \nimplementation of PKH in remote and disadvantaged areas.27  \n \n23.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination in the areas of PEM reforms and SDG implementation. ADB coordinates dialogue \nand activities closely with the IMF and the World Bank. ADB joined the IMF\u2019s Public Investment \nManagement  Assessment  mission  in  2019  and  the  PEM  reforms  under  the  program  are \ncomplementary to the World Bank\u2019s Third Fiscal Reform Development Policy Loan approved in \nMay 2019.28 Following cofinancing of subprograms 1 and 2, German development cooperation \nthrough KfW approved cofinancing of \u20ac500 million for subprogram 3. ADB and KfW conducted \njoint missions to discuss the policy matrix, and coordinated SDG reforms with the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. ADB also coordinated with the bilateral development agencies of the \ngovernments of Australia, France, and the United States on PEM reforms.29 \n \nLoan for Subprogram 3 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program. \nManila. \n24 Independent Evaluation Department. 2017.

Impacts of the Reform \n \n24.  Economic impacts of the program. Three out of four outcome indicators in the Design \nand Monitoring Framework have been achieved early. The proportion of targeted national and \nsubnational spending has increased by 22.3% from the baseline of Rp995.0 trillion ($70.4 billion) \nin 2015 to Rp1,216.6 trillion ($86.1 billion) in 2019. The 2017 Public Expenditure Financial \nAccountability (PEFA) report showed improvement in the indicator on expenditure composition \noutturn, which rose from a D in 2012 to C+ in 2017.30 This target is now revised upward to B. The \nrating for aggregate expenditure outturn remained the same, as budget realization was 88.6% for \n2015 and 89% for 2016. However, there have been significant improvements for the budget \nrealization which recorded 94% for 2017 and 99% for 2018, respectively. In addition to the PEFA, \nthe  Open  Budget  Index  reported  improved  scores  for  transparency  and  budget  oversight. \nLikewise, the IMF reported improvements in the quality and efficiency of public investment.31 The \nprogram impact assessment estimates that the economic and social benefits of the program were \n$4.8 billion\u2013$7.6 billion.32 The benefits are derived from increased and targeted public spending, \nequivalent to adding an annual average of 6.5%\ua7f710.4% to priority sector spending.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n25.  The government has requested a single tranche loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.33The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \n \ngrace period of 3 years with a straight-line repayment method and an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. KfW approved cofinancing of \u20ac500 million. The loan size is based on \nIndonesia\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  development  impact  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and \ndevelopment spending arising from the reforms. For 2019, the government\u2019s projected total gross \nborrowing requirement is estimated at $59.6 billion. To finance the deficit, the government plans \nto raise about $53.4 billion from the issuance of securities, $5.9 billion from official development \nassistance, and $0.3 billion from nonofficial development assistance sources. Climate mitigation \nis estimated to cost $26.04 million, and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $57.29 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.   The MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency, as the executing agency, is responsible for coordinating \nprogram-related reforms. Implementing agencies include the directorates general of budget, \ntreasury, and fiscal balance in MOF; and BAPPENAS. The implementation period for subprogram \n3 is from April 2018 to August 2019. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Safeguards.  Subprogram  3  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people. \n \n30 World Bank. 2018.

Poverty and social. Subprogram 3 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at \nentry. Key reforms that mainstreamed gender included integrating gender strategy into the SDG \nRoadmap, improvement of the PKH to provide additional benefit for families with pregnant \nwomen, elderly and people with disabilities, and inclusion of indicator to reduce maternal mortality \nfor the regional incentive fund. In addition, increased expenditure in education, health, and \ninfrastructure will reduce poverty and help the bottom 40% of the population.  \n \n29.  Governance. In 2017, Indonesia scored either A or B (both considered above basic \nalignment with international good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s PEFA \nreport (footnote 30).Indicators with particularly good assessment results include transparency of \n \npublic  finance,  and  accounting  and  reporting.  Government  regulations  issued  in  2017 \nstrengthened the legal and regulatory frameworks for public financial management, mandating \ncoordination  between  BAPPENAS  and  the  MOF  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  subsequent \nregulations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \n30.  Risk and mitigating measures. Two key risks have been identified in the program.34 The \nfirst pertains to macroeconomic risks, particularly in relation to tighter global financial conditions. \nThis is mitigated by Indonesia\u2019s sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and appropriate monetary \nand fiscal policies. Second is the inadequate capacity, especially at the subnational level. ADB is \nproviding TA to improve subnational government capacity for SDG implementation (para. 22). \nModerate risks include ineffective implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework and \nperformance-based budgeting, and lower revenue that may hamper critical expenditure for SDG \nimplementation.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n31.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $500,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 3 of the Fiscal and Public \nExpenditure Management Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 October 2019 \n \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nHousehold income inequality reduced (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nTargets and Baselines \nMechanisms \nEffect of the  By 2021:     \nReform  a.
