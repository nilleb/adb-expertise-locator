THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to\nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Bangladesh Power System \nEnhancement and Efficiency Improvement Project. \n2. The outcome of the ongoing project is to improve access to efficient and reliable electricity\nsupply in Bangladesh. The ongoing project includes four main outputs: (i) national transmission\nnetwork in southern Bangladesh strengthened (output 1); (ii) distribution network in Dhaka Electric\nSupply Company Limited areas improved (output 2); (iii) distribution network in rural areas of\nBangladesh, including the capacity of end users, improved (output 3); and (iv) capacity in power\nsector agencies enhanced (output 4). The proposed additional financing will further improve the\nelectricity distribution network in rural areas (output 3) in the Khulna division, one of the poorest\ndivisions in Bangladesh.1\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n3. Performance  of  the  project.  The  proposed  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for\nadditional financing as the overall project is (i) technically feasible, economically viable, and\nfinancially sound; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s \ndevelopment objective; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, \n2021\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The ongoing project is performing well as\n(i) the project is rated on track under the project performance rating system; (ii) each safeguard\ncovenant item is complied with; (iii) delivery of expected outputs, including implementation of the\ngender action plan, is rated successful; and (iv) the management of risks is rated successful as\nall the risks included in the risk assessment and risk management plan have been managed\nsuccessfully. As of 18 September 2020, cumulative contract awards on the loans and grant were\n$602.47 million (97.53%) while disbursements were $456.99 million (75.9%).3\n4. Relevance of the project during COVID-19 pandemic. Reliable electricity supply is\nlifeline infrastructure in rural areas both under normal circumstances and during and after the\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. During the COVID-19 restrictions, the electricity\nsupply has been one of the most critical inputs to support essential services, such as health care,\nagricultural activities and food supply services, and online businesses for basic social needs.\nFurther, reliable electricity supply is essential for household activities during times of lockdown,\nsuch as working from home and online education for school-age children.\n5. COVID-19 has also significantly reduced the growth prospects of Bangladesh,4 and the\npandemic will ultimately impact the rural poor more since they are the most vulnerable and the\nleast resilient. Increased government spending is necessary to revive the economy. Infrastructure\nspending on rural power distribution system improvements will generate local employment, help\nmaintain access by rural communities to health services and medical supplies, and enhance the\nlong-term growth prospects of the economy.\n1  Approved Report and Recommendation of the President for the Original Project (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n2   ADB. 2020. Bangladesh: Country Operations Business Plan, 2021\u20132023. Manila.\n3  Cumulative contract awards on Output 3 amount to $417.25 million while disbursements amount to $385.76 million   \n(81.08% of awarded contracts). \n4  ADB. Economic Indicators for Bangladesh. https://www.adb.org/countries/bangladesh/economy. ", "2 \n6. Suitability of using the additional financing modality. The additional financing is\nstrongly linked to the ongoing project\u2019s outputs and outcome and provides efficiency gains by\nexpanding  the  scope  of  an  existing  output,  using  the  same  designs  and  implementation\narrangements and building upon the due diligence of the ongoing project.\n7. Sector performance. About 50% of installed power generation capacity has private\nsector investment. The transmission company and distribution company serving the capital city\nhave transformed into companies listed in the market to raise capital for investment needs. The\nrural  electrification  subsector,  which  serves  low-income  customers,  adopts  the  consumers\u2019\ncooperative model. The sector has been progressing to decarbonize, as committed to in the\nnationally  determined  contributions  for  Bangladesh,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and\ndeveloping domestic renewable energy resources, among others.5 Also, Bangladesh, which is\nalready importing power from India, has plans to expand imports in the form of clean energy from\nneighboring countries such as Bhutan and Nepal. This is supported under the South Asia\nSubregional Economic Cooperation. 6\n8. Strategic context. The overall project\u2019s impact continues to be aligned with (i) the\ngovernment\u2019s Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, 2010\u20132021: Making Vision 2021 a Reality,7 and\nthe 7th Five-Year Plan,8 which is accorded high priority by the government; (ii) ADB\u2019s country\npartnership strategy and country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for Bangladesh (footnote\n2); and (iii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 20309 by further improving access to efficient and reliable electricity\nsupply in the rural areas of Bangladesh.\nB. Project Description\n9. The impacts and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged. The overall project\nis  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  100%  access  to  power  by  2021  and  power  sector\nsustainability improved in Bangladesh by 2030.10 The project will have the following outcome:\naccess to efficient and reliable electricity supply in Bangladesh improved.11\n10. The project will install an additional 990 kilometers (km) of 33 kilovolt (kV) and 3,000 km\nof 11 kV below distribution lines and associated facilities, including 51 units of 33 kV/11 kV\nsubstations in rural areas in Khulna division, which will expand output 3 (distribution network in\nrural areas of Bangladesh improved) of the ongoing project. This will result in increasing electricity\naccess to 150,000 rural households.\n5  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests.  2015.

The overall project complements investments in power generation capacity by other\ndevelopment partners and the private sector. These have contributed to improvements in the\nreliability and coverage of electricity supply to rural and urban customers.\n12. Capacity building support under the ongoing project and the associated policy dialogue\nled to a tariff increase in February 2020, following an increase in 2017.12 This will help improve\nthe financial sustainability of the overall project and the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board\n(BREB). The proposed project will expand these efforts in the form of creating an inclusive working\nenvironment by renovating the existing BREB\u2019s offices with designs that cater to the elderly,\nwomen,  children,  and  disabled  people.  This  includes  separate  toilets,  women\u2019s  restrooms,\nseparate prayer rooms, and ramps for the disabled. The proposed project will also conduct a \ngender analysis of the BREB\u2019s corporate structure and develop a corporate gender equality\nstrategy for the BREB. \nD.

The implementation arrangements of the ongoing project, such as the executing and\nimplementing agencies, will remain unchanged. The executing agency of the additional financing\nproject is the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, and implementing agency is the\nBREB,  which  distributes  the  electricity  in  rural  areas  in  Bangladesh.  The  same  project\nimplementation unit established within the BREB will be responsible for the implementation of the\nadditional financing project. The implementation period of the additional financing will be from\nJanuary 2021 to December 2025. The implementation arrangements are described in detail in\nthe PAM (footnote 13).\n14 Details are in the Project Administration Manual and Updated Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "5 \nIII. DUE DILIGENCE\nA. Summary Due Diligence Results\n19. A summary of the due diligence assessments for the proposed additional financing is\npresented in Table 3. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked\ndocuments in Appendix 2.\nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nTechnical  Technology to be utilized for the project is quite standard and is the same for the \nongoing project. The BREB has broad experience in procurement, construction, \nand commissioning for this type of project. Therefore, the technology risk is low. \nEconomic and  The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return was estimated at 14.7% with the\nfinancial viability  environmental benefits, well above the 9.0% economic cost of capital, making \nthe project economically viable. Sensitivity testing indicated that the project is \nlikely to remain sustainable in the face of adverse economic impact of various \ntypes. \nFinancial analysis of the project indicated that the project is financially viable, with \na financial internal rate of return of 2.6%, exceeding the weighted average cost \nof capital of 2.2%. Sensitivity analysis with 5% increase in capital cost, 5% \nincrease in operation and maintenance cost, 3% increase in power purchase \ncost, 3% decrease in benefit, and 1-year delay in implementation showed that \nthe project is sensitive in the case of changes in power purchase cost and benefit. \nSustainability  The BREB has a well-established maintenance planning and budget allocation \nsystem. It has assigned 71 qualified staff members to operate and maintain the \ninvested assets over the economic life. It has also gained extensive experience \nin operating and maintaining power distribution assets since its establishment in \n1977, and has received training from various donors. The electricity tariff is based \non the tariff set by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission in February \n2020.a The utilities are required to file periodically for tariff increases to cover \ncosts. This will help improve financial sustainability of the overall project and of \nthe BREB. \nGovernance  Financial management. The BREB has been performing satisfactorily on the \nongoing project and will continue to handle all project financial matters for the \nadditional financing. The updated financial management capacity assessment \nconcluded that the overall project financial management risk is moderate. This \nrating  is  based  on  the  observation  that  the  project  implementation  unit  is \nwell-established and functioning well. To further improve corporate governance, \nthe BREB will continue to strengthen its internal audit function and enhance its \ninformation systems under the financial  management action plan, which is \ncurrently ongoing and supported by consultants hired under the ongoing loan. \nProcurement. Strategic procurement planning was conducted in January 2020 \nand approved in September 2020 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guide on Assessing \nProcurement Risks and Determining Project Procurement Classification.b The \nproject  procurement  classification  is  category  B  and  procurement  risk  is \nmoderate. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was\nexplained to and discussed with the government and the BREB. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project \nadministration manual.c", "6 \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nIntegrity due diligence. Risk assessment was conducted in January 2020. \nBased on the information provided, and in the absence of any other ongoing \nmatter that could become an issue, the potential integrity and reputational risk \narising from ADB\u2019s association with the BREB is low to medium.\nPoverty, social, and  The project area (Khulna division) is one of the poorest divisions in Bangladesh \ngender  (poverty rate of 27.7%). Improved access, quality, and reliability of the electricity \nsupply in rural areas will help to (i) reduce household consumption of kerosene \nfor cooking and lighting, thereby reducing household fuel expenditure; (ii) reduce \nthe burden of household chores; (iii) catalyze energy-based economic activities, \nthereby improving household incomes; and (iv) improve the educational and \nmedical environment. Farmers can reduce fuel expenditure for irrigation by \nswitching diesel-powered pumps to electric pumps, which will help to reduce \nproduction costs. \nThe gender mainstreaming category of the ongoing project and the proposed \nadditional financing is classified effective gender mainstreaming as the project \narea under the additional financing is part of the ongoing project. Gender actions \nunder the ongoing project are on track and will be continued under the additional \nfinancing.d In addition to the ongoing actions, a gender equality strategy for the \nBREB will be developed, and the existing BREB offices will be renovated to \naccommodate the elderly, women, children, and disabled people. \nSafeguards  The additional financing is classified B for environment, B for resettlement, and \nC for indigenous peoples. A total of 51 new substations will need 21.86 acres \n(8.85 hectares) of land. The land will be purchased through a willing buyer, willing \nseller process. The additional financing will not have impacts on legally protected \nareas or internationally or nationally important biodiversity areas or physical \ncultural resources. The updated resettlement plan and  initial environmental \nexamination have been disclosed on the ADB website on 22 October 2020 and \n16 November 2020 respectively. Distribution lines do not have any significant \nenvironmental and social impacts as these usually follow the right-of-way of the \nexisting roads. The project is not anticipated to impact on indigenous peoples, \nwhich has been confirmed during the project due diligence. Consultations have \nbeen undertaken during project preparation, and a two-tier grievance redress \nmechanism has been established under the ongoing loan and is functioning well. \nThe project implementation unit will be supported by an environmental consultant \nand a social consultant for the additional financing. Environmental monitoring \nreports will be submitted semiannually during construction and annually during \noperation. Social monitoring reports will be submitted semiannually.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BREB = Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board. \na  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. 2020.
