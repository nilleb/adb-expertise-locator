The  program  will  support  the  government\u2019s \nVision to 2030 and Public Finance Development Strategy to 2025 (Strategy 2025), 1 and help the \nthe  Eighth  National  Socio-Economic \ngovernment  realize \nDevelopment Plan (NSEDP) 2016\u20132020.2 The program has been classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming and contributes to gender equality (operational priority 2) under Strategy 2030 of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). It will build the foundations for gender-responsive budgeting, \nincluding  gender  capacity  assessments  to  strengthen  organizational  structures  and  ensure \ngreater representation of gender stakeholders in key PFM reform structures. The program also \ncontributes to Strategy 2030 by strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational \npriority 6).3 The program addresses Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 by strengthening \ngovernance and inclusive institutions, and SDG 17 by enhancing domestic revenue mobilization \nand  building  capacity.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  \n2017\u20132020,4 and  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2019\u20132021  for  the  Lao \nPDR.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nits  development  priorities \n\nin \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Lao PDR is currently one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia and \nhas made substantial progress towards graduating from least-developed country (LDC) status by \n2020. A resource boom and strong foreign direct investment in resource sectors resulted in robust \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP), which averaged 7.4% during 2010\u20132018. Gross national \nincome per capita reached $2,599 in 2018. Strong growth has alleviated poverty,  and the Lao \nPDR\u2019s poverty rate declined from 27.6% in 2008 to 23.2% in 2013. The Lao PDR met the criteria \nfor graduation from LDC status for the first time in 2018.6 \n \n\n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao PDR. 2018.

Manila. \n6  The Lao PDR met the thresholds for  gross national income per capita and Human Assets Index for the first time \nduring the March 2018 review. If progress continues until the subsequent 2021 review, the Lao PDR will graduate \nfrom  LDC  status  in  2024,  following  a  3-year  implementation  period.  Further  information  can  be  found  at: \nhttp://www.la.undp.org/content/lao_pdr/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2018/3/19/lao-pdr_s-eligibility-for-grad-\nfrom-least-developed-countr/. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDespite strong economic performance, the Lao PDR\u2019s social development indicators have \n4. \nfallen well behind regional averages; inequality widened between 1993 and 2013, and the Gini \ncoefficient increased from 0.31 to 0.36. The Lao PDR is also increasingly vulnerable to revenue \nvolatility  resulting  from  its  dependence  on  natural  resources  with fluctuating  commodity  prices \nand  exacerbated  by  weak  tax  administration.  This  has  led  to  a  growing  fiscal  deficit  and  high \npublic debt levels, which have increased the Lao PDR\u2019s exposure to macroeconomic shocks. This \ncould undermine sustainable financing of services and derail the country\u2019s poverty reduction and \ndevelopment goals under the Vision to 2030 (footnote 1).7 In addition, the Lao PDR\u2019s susceptibility \nto  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards,  such  as  drought  and  landslides,  can  also  have  a \ndevastating impact on an agrarian economy and hinder long-term growth prospects.8 To reduce \nthe  Lao  PDR\u2019s  vulnerability  to  economic  shocks,  and  to  maintain  growth  and  improve  social \noutcomes, more must be done to strengthen PFM. The government has identified three primary \ndevelopment constraints: (i) lack of comprehensive debt management and tax reform strategies; \n(ii) absence of medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting; and (iii) weak governance and budget \noversight.9 \n  \n\nFigure 1: Tax and Non-tax Revenue (% of GDP)\n\n16.2\n\n16.0\n\n15.8\n\n15.6\n\n15.4\n\n15.2\n\n16.1\n\n2010-2016 (average)\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16.1\n \n \n \n2017\n \n \n \n\n15.5\n\n2018\n\nFigure 2: Fiscal Deficit (% of GDP)\n\nFigure 3: Public and Publicly \nGuaranteed Debt (% of GDP)\n\n \n\n \n\n5.6\n\n5.1 5.5\n\n \n \n\n100\n\n4.4\n\n4.3\n\n56.2\n\n57.9\n\n57.7\n\n58.5\n\n55.8\n\n57.2\n\n0\n\n50\n\n0.5\n\n1.7\n\n2.8\n\n3.2\n\n51.4\n\n45.4\n\n49.6\n\n46.2\n\n45.6\n\n45.8\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and International Monetary Fund.  \n \nLack  of  comprehensive  debt  management  and  tax  reform  strategies.

The  weak  strategic  link \n6. \nbetween  policy,  planning,  and  budgeting  undermines  overall  fiscal  discipline  in  the  budget \nprocess.  This  contributes  to  large  budget  deficits  and  ineffective  financing  of  development \npriorities, placing the achievement of the NSEDP priorities at risk.18 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \ndoes  not  provide  indicative  budget  ceilings  to  line  ministries  to  guide  their  budget  preparation \nprocess. The absence of a medium-term framework weakens the link between budget allocation \nand estimated funding needs at the line ministry level, causing budget unpredictability and weak \nbudget preparation and execution, and ultimately hampering public service delivery and poverty \nreduction objectives. Finally, the Lao PDR also attained low scores in the 2018 Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability Assessment for key PFM indicators, such as a multiyear perspective \nin  expenditure  budgeting  (rated  D),  and  orderliness  in  the  budget  preparation  process  \n(rated C+).19  \n \n7. \nWeak governance and oversight of budget. This constraint relates to the government\u2019s \nefforts to effectively implement its PFM reform strategy and improve oversight. The State Budget \nLaw,  revised  in  2015,  provides  the  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  a  budget  preparation \nprocess and gives the MOF a strengthened mandate for negotiating budget allocations with line \nministries. However, much of the existing legislation has yet to be fully implemented because of \nthe lack of relevant regulations and the limited oversight of implementing agencies. In addition, \n\n                                                \n10 World Bank. Doing Business 2019: Training for Reform.

Coupled with weak capacity at the National Assembly, there is little meaningful \noversight of the annual budget. The core budget documents, such as the annual approved budget, \nquarterly fiscal reports, and public finance annual reports, are not accessible to the public. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nGovernment  reform  program.  In  June  2016,  the  government  launched  the  Eighth \nNSEDP  2016\u20132020  (footnote  2),  which  aims  to  pursue  continued  economic  growth  and \nmacroeconomic  stability,  while  reducing  the  poverty  rate  and  economic  vulnerability,  and \nimproving  service  delivery  in  health  and  education.  The  NSEDP  focuses  on  the  need  for  a \nmacroeconomic framework to provide information in a responsive, timely, and accurate manner. \nThe  NSEDP  also  aims  to  improve  revenue  and  expenditure  management  by  strengthening \nrevenue  collection  and  ensuring  that  expenditure  management  is  in  line  with  a  financial  plan \napproved by the National Assembly. Strategy 2025 (footnote 1) further articulates the need for a \nstrong, transparent, and modern public finance system in line with international standards. The \nstrategy  includes  goals  and  priorities  in  four  areas:  (i)  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability, \nincluding control of the budget deficit; (ii) maximizing revenue collection; (iii) developing a sound \nexpenditure  policy  in  line  with  rationalizing  spending;  and  (iv)  prudent  debt  management.  To \nimplement  this,  the  government  has  developed  the  Implementation  Plan  for  Public  Finance \nManagement Reform, Step 1 (2018\u20132020) of Phase II (2018\u20132025) (PFM implementation plan) \nunder  direct  responsibility  of  the  MOF  and  relevant  line  ministries.20 The  government\u2019s  fiscal \nconsolidation efforts are expected to gradually lower fiscal deficit from 4.4% of GDP in 2018 to \n4.3% of GDP in 2019, and 3.7% in 2020 (footnote 12). \n  \n9. \nProgrammatic  Approach.  The  program  employs  a  programmatic  approach,  which \nrecognizes  the  need  for  long-term  engagement  and  strategic  sequencing  of  policy  actions  to \nstrengthen  PFM.  A  programmatic  approach  also  enables  ADB  to  align  its  support  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  PFM  reform  priorities  over  a  medium-  to  long-term  horizon.  Strengthened  PFM \nsystems, together with carefully managed fiscal policy, will support macroeconomic stability and \nensure  that  public  resources  are  efficiently  transformed  into  public  investments  and  social \nservices. The program includes two subprograms to be implemented over 2018\u20132021, covered \nby  a medium-term results framework to ensure the  long-term  engagement  necessary for  PFM \nreforms. The program will focus on three key reform areas: (i) public debt management and tax \nreform, (ii) medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting, and (iii) budget governance and credibility \n(Appendix 4). Subprogram 1 consists of eight policy actions, all of which have been accomplished, \nand  three  of  which  are  pertinent  to  gender  mainstreaming.  They  are  closely  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s PFM reform implementation plan (footnote 18). This will provide the foundation for \nthe  ensuing,  more  targeted  policy  actions  to  push  forward  the  three  program  reform  areas  in \nsubprogram 2. It will deepen the reforms further through support in the implementation phases of \nthe reform areas, including development of regulations and institutional strengthening. \n \n10. \nStrengthening public debt management and tax reform. This reform area will improve \npublic debt management and revenue collections. It addresses the widening fiscal deficits without \ncompromising sound public spending to achieve the NSEDP goals, and ensures that financing \nconstraints do not lead to sharp reversals in fiscal policy. Under subprogram 1, there are three \npolicy actions. First, the MOF adopted the 2018 Public Debt Management Law to rationalize the \nuse of debt instruments and to cap the rise in public debts. The law, which became effective from \n\n                                                \n20 Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2018.  Implementation  Plan  for  Public  Finance  Management  Reform,  Step  1  \n\n(2018\u20132020) of Phase II (2018\u20132025). Vientiane. \n\n\fAugust  2018,  requires  the  National  Assembly  to  approve  all  investment  projects  that  exceed  \n$50 million. It also sets out provisions on the public debt management strategic plan, establishes \ndirect  borrowing  procedures,  defines  criteria  for  government  borrowing,  and  provides  the \nguidelines for government bond issuance. Moreover, the law aims to optimize debt management \nand  gradually  reduce  the  debt  burden  to  50%  of  GDP  by  2025,  and  guide  prudent  spending \ndecisions in the medium term. The law also better defines the criteria and approval procedures \nfor infrastructure investments to ensure that future investments have high social returns and are \nclosely aligned to NSEDP objectives.21 Debt reporting and consolidation of domestic and external \ndebt have been further strengthened through an integrated approach. Under subprogram 2, the \nMOF will implement the Public Debt Management Law by establishing a fully functioning public \ndebt management unit, with a 30% female staff requirement and a clear regulatory framework.  \nThe Debt Management Unit will be strengthened to monitor potential fiscal risks and impacts of \ncontingent liabilities. \n \n11. \nSecond, the tax system has been strengthened and modernized through both tax policy \nand  administrative  measures.  The  government  has  finalized  the  drafts  of  new  laws  on  tax \nadministration, income tax, and excise tax. Together, they will considerably strengthen tax policy \nand administration by addressing the need for a broader tax base and modernized tax system. \nAn organizational restructuring has placed local tax authorities under the MOF\u2019s Tax Department \nto improve revenue collection coordination and oversight between central and provincial levels \nand ensure that all revenues collected at the local level are returned to the consolidated fund. The \nTax  Department  has  also  established  a  Revenue  Collection  Division  (responsible  for  large \ntaxpayers,  who  account  for  40%  of  total  tax  revenues)  to  improve  tax  compliance  by  large \nbusinesses.  Third,  the  government  has  completed  the  Tax  Sector  Development  Plan  for  \n2018\u20132020  to  reform  the  tax  system  by  strengthening  the  legislative  framework,  improving \nrevenue collection, and enhancing institutional capacity. It has also incorporated a gender action \nplan to address priorities under its strategic goal to build staff and institutional capacity in the Tax \nDepartment.22 Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  enact  tax  laws  on  tax  administration, \nexcise taxes, and income taxes for improved transparency and compliance. The MOF will also \nconduct a social impact assessment of the new laws with an emphasis on impacts on small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (including  those  headed  by  women),  and  low-income  families.  The \npost-program  partnership  framework  (PPPF)  may  include  ADB  support  to  deepen  reforms  in \npublic  debt management  by  improving  coordination  with  subnational governments for  effective \npublic debt management and strengthening the capacity of relevant agencies to implement the \nnew tax laws. \n \nImproving medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting. This reform area will enable \n12. \nthe  government  to  finance  its  priorities  and  contain  its  fiscal  deficit  by  effectively  managing \nexpenditures and revenues over the medium term. With its PFM reform implementation plan, the \ngovernment has included a target for fiscal deficits of between 3\u20135% in 2020 and less than 3% \nby 2025 (footnote 18). Under subprogram 1, there are two policy actions. First, with support from \nthe  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization  Trust  Fund  administered  by  ADB,  the  government \nimplemented  medium-term  fiscal  planning,  which  determines  the  overall  envelopes  for \nexpenditures in line with a fiscally sustainable budget and greater predictability and transparency. \nThis policy action has improved the budget process and development outcomes through greater \nclarity  of  policy  objectives,  predictability  in  budget  allocations,  and  transparency  in  the  use  of \n                                                \n21 The new projects need to have clear links to poverty reduction and/or disaster risk reduction. Infrastructure projects \nthat exceed $50 million will need to be presented to and approved by the National Assembly. A project approval \nmanual has been developed to streamline project submissions by line ministries. \n\n22 Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  Ministry  of  Finance,  Tax  Department.  2019.  Gender  Action  Plan  for  Staff  and \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building. Vientiane. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fresources.  The  MOF  strengthened  its  guidance  to  line  ministries  in  the  budget  process  by \nproviding a budget ceiling to ensure that overall fiscal deficit targets are met. A series of capacity \nbuilding  programs  on  gender-responsive  budgeting  have  been  provided  to  high-level  and \ntechnical  government  officials  in  the  MOF  and  relevant  line  ministries  to  foster  gender \nconsiderations  in  budget  planning.  Second,  the  MOF  implemented  tax  and  nontax  revenue \nplanning to establish clear revenue targets and improve tax and nontax revenue administration. \nThe  revenue  planning  was  also  integrated  into  the  medium-term  fiscal  planning.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government  will  align fiscal  policy  with  the  NSEDP  goals  by  establishing  a \nfiscal policy and budget statement to line ministries. This will provide fiscal and contingent liability \nrisk assessments and detailed budget ceilings to individual line ministries for the following budget \nyear,  plus  indicative  ceilings  for  two  additional  years  to  enable  line  ministries  to  prioritize \nexpenditures  to  maintain  overall  targets.  The  government  will  ensure  public  expenditures  are \nefficiently allocated to priority NSEDP sectors (especially health and education) within the overall \nbudget  ceilings  to  enable  the  government\u2019s  long-term  fiscal  deficit  target  (reducing  the  budget \ndeficit to 2.5% by 2022) to be met. The PPPF may include ADB support on improving medium-\nterm expenditure planning and budget submissions among line ministries. \n \n13. \nEnhancing governance and budget credibility. This reform area will foster governance, \ntransparency, and credibility of the government\u2019s PFM reform agenda and budgeting processes \nto ensure that public resources are effectively overseen and channeled towards realization of the \nNSEDP  goals.  Under  subprogram  1,  there  are  three  policy  actions.  First,  in  March  2018,  the \ngovernment operationalized its Strategy 2025 through the PFM implementation plan (footnote 18) \nto implement the six priority programs.23 This includes priority areas for (i) improving fiscal policy, \n(ii)  developing  a  legal  framework  for  the  finance  sector,  (iii)  reforming  revenue  management,  \n(iv)  strengthening  expenditure  management,  (v)  modernizing  PFM,  and  (vi)  improving  the \norganizational  structure  and  human  resource  development.  Second,  a  national  steering \ncommittee was appointed to ensure continuity and oversight of the PFM reform agenda in line \nwith  Strategy  2025,  with  representatives  from  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  the  National \nCommittee  for  Advancement  of  Women  included  in  the  implementation  committee.  Third,  to \nimprove  transparency,  the  MOF  adopted  standards  in  line  with  the  International  Budget \nPartnership  and  published  core  budget  documents, 24  particularly  the  Government  Finance \nStatistics  Annual  Reports  for  Fiscal  Years  2015,  2016,  2017,  and  mid  2018  on  revenues,  \nexpenditures,  and  revenue  collection.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  MOF  will  strengthen  budget \nplanning,  preparation,  and  execution  in compliance with  the  State  Budget  Law  by  establishing \nrelevant budget regulations and legal frameworks. The PPPF may include ADB support to the \nnext generation of the PFM reform agenda, including fiscal transparency and credibility. \n \n14. \nADB experience. ADB has been a key long-term reform partner in the Lao PDR, providing \nloans, grants,  and technical  assistance  (TA) to  support  PFM  reforms  since the  Public  Finance \nManagement  Strengthening  Program  was  approved  in  2005  (Figure  4).  In  2005\u20132014,  ADB \nfocused on selected areas of public expenditure management, including efficiency, planning and \nbudgeting, and accountability, to enable the government to successfully integrate national poverty \nreduction  strategies  into  budgetary  priorities  and  implementation. 25  This  support  helped  the \n\n                                                \n23 The  government  in  July  2017  approved  the  Vision  to  2030  and  Public  Finance  Development  Strategy  to  2025 \n(footnote 1), which assigns the MOF to coordinate with line agencies for implementation of the comprehensive PFM \nreform.  It  also  provides  the  road  map  for  the  second  generation  of  PFM  reforms  and  defines  the  government\u2019s \npriorities for strengthening its PFM systems. \n\n24 International Budget Partnership. 2010.

First,  long-term \nengagement  is  essential  to  push  through  complex  public  finance  reforms  in  a  weak  capacity \nenvironment. The crosscutting nature of PFM reform programs requires a programmatic approach \nand policy sequencing to enable flexibility and responsiveness to the government\u2019s PFM reform \nagenda. Second, the leading role of the MOF in driving the PFM reform agenda and embedding \nkey  planning  processes  as  part  of  the  core  budget  process  is  key.  Previous  ADB  support \ndeveloped the necessary tools for the reforms, but may have underestimated the need for strong \nleadership and ownership by MOF of these reforms. This will be important for the Lao PDR to \nachieve fiscal consolidation. Finally, the program will benefit from strong coordination with ADB \nsector teams, such as health and education, to ensure that efficiency gains in PFM strengthen \nimplementation at the sector level. \n \n\nFigure 4: ADB Engagement with Public Finance Management Reform Agenda in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic \n \n\n \n\n2015\u20132019: \nTA to bring in the \nmedium-term budget \nand public expenditure \nplanning \n\n2012\u20132014: \nTA supported the state \naudit agencies for \ngreater governance, \ntransparency, and \naccountability \n\n2008\u20132011: \nTA continued to foster \nefficiency and \naccountability of \nbudgeting and public \nexpenditures \n\n2005\u20132008: Initial \nefforts to improve \nfiscal planning \nand budgeting \nthrough TA\n\n2010\u20132014: Governance and \nCapacity Development in \nPublic Sector Management \nSubprograms 1\u20132 (footnote \n24) focused on PFM reforms \ntargeting at governance, \ntransparency, and capacity of \nMOF and relevant agencies\n\n2013\u20132018: \nHealth Sector \nGovernance Program \nSubprograms 1\u20132 \n(footnote 25) improved \nefficiency of budget \nallocations to the health \nsectors and \nachievements of health \noutcomes under MDGs \nand SDGs \n\n2018\u20132021: Strengthening \nPublic Finance Managament \nSubprograms 1\u20132 to support \nthe government\u2019s PFM reform \nagendas and implementation \nstrategies aligned with the \nVision to 2030 and Public \nFinance Development Strategy \nto 2025 (footnote 1)\n\nMDG  =  Millennium  Development  Goal;  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance;  PFM  =  public  finance  management;  \nSDG = Sustainable Development Goal; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n\nDemocratic Republic for Strengthening Public Financial Management.

Manila. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADB value addition. ADB experience underlines that successful PFM reforms in the Lao \n15. \nPDR require a long-term, multipronged approach to developing sequenced and demand-driven \nreform agendas in line with government priorities. ADB engagement in the sector has prepared \nthe way for reforms and generated important lessons. The recent TA has strengthened planning \nby  establishing  a  comprehensive  revenue  and  fiscal  planning  tool  to  generate  overall  budget \nceilings  and  better  use  limited  fiscal  resources,  consistent  with  a  sustainable  macroeconomic \nframework.28 This program will offer value addition to the Lao PDR\u2019s PFM reforms in two ways. \nFirst, the programmatic approach will enable ADB to both deepen its engagement in these PFM \nagendas and provide more comprehensive and systematic support that (i) builds on past ADB \nassistance and (ii) is aligned with the government\u2019s Strategy 2025 and the PFM implementation \nplan (footnote 18). More importantly, the program recognizes that successful PFM reforms require \nsustained efforts by the MOF to lead the complex reform process and coordinate with relevant \nministries  and  stakeholders.  Therefore,  through  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement,  the  program  is \ndesigned to foster leadership and ownership by the MOF of the reform agendas. This will help \nsustain the momentum of the reform process, thereby achieving more meaningful, sustainable \nreform outcomes. \n \n16. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The development partner coordination mechanism \nis  well  institutionalized  and  led  by  the  government.  It  is  embedded  in  the  government-owned \nreform  program,  as  articulated  in  Strategy  2025.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination  through  the  recently  established  PFM  steering  committee  group.  Development \npartners in the sector also meet on a quarterly basis to share progress in ongoing PFM reform \nareas. Close policy coordination and dialogue with the government and development partners will \ncontinue  through  participation  in  government-led  coordination  platforms.  ADB  has  coordinated \nwith key development partners active in PFM reforms in the Lao PDR throughout the program \ndesign, including the European Union, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the IMF, and \nthe  World  Bank.29 ADB  also  coordinated  with  the  IMF  to  assess  fiscal  outlook  and  risks  and \ncontinued to monitor the public debt situation. The policy actions in the program are consistent \nwith IMF\u2019s 2019 Article IV Consultation assessment and recommendations for the Lao PDR. IMF \nhas provided guidance to the Lao PDR, under which the Lao PDR is expected to initiate fiscal \nreforms and expenditure rationalization. IMF is also providing technical assistance support, which \nfocuses on medium-term revenue strategy, customs reforms, and development of a unified chart \nof accounts for improved expenditure tracking. \n \nC. \n \nEconomic impacts of the program. The impact of the program is sustainable financing \n17. \nof public services for achieving the NSEDP goals (footnote 1). The effect of the program is PFM \nand fiscal position strengthened. The program supports the Lao PDR\u2019s capability to develop and \nimplement a clear fiscal strategy, grounded in a macroeconomic framework and closely aligned \nto its NSEDP priorities, in order to meet its fiscal deficit targets in the medium term. The program \nimpact assessment estimates the gross benefits from the policy actions in the three reform areas \nat approximately $4.5 billion accrued over a 10-year period.30 A significant proportion of the gross \nbenefits stem from efficiency gains from improved fiscal planning and governance of the budget \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n28 ADB. 2015.

There is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. The indicative amount of the loan under subprogram 2 is $40 million. The loan \nsize is based on the Lao PDR\u2019s financing needs, the development impact of the policy actions, \nand  development  spending  in  conjunction  with  the  reform.  In  2019,  the  government\u2019s  gross \nfinancing need  is  $811.65 million,  equivalent  to  a  projected  budget  deficit  of  4.2%  of GDP. To \nfinance the deficit, the government plans to raise $591.3 million from foreign financing including \nborrowings and grants. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nThe  MOF  is  both  the  executing  and  implementing  agency  for  the  program  and  is \nresponsible for coordinating program-related reforms and driving reforms at the line ministry level. \nThe implementation period is from March 2018 to June 2019 for subprogram 1 and from July 2019 \nto  March  2021  for  subprogram  2.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n20. \nSafeguards.  Following  evaluation  of  the  policy  actions,  subprogram  1  is  classified  as \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Subprogram \n2 is also anticipated to be classified category C, which will be confirmed at a later stage. \n \n21. \nPoverty  and  social.  This  program  will  help  maintain  macroeconomic  stability,  support \nprudent fiscal management, and help improve fiscal predictability through medium-term budgeting \nin key social and economic sectors. This will allow the government to gradually achieve a more \nfocused  approach  to  budgeting  for  the  social  sectors,  the  SDGs,  and  its  targeted  poverty \nprograms, such as the Poverty Reduction Fund, to directly benefit the poor and vulnerable. This \nwill  support  the  government\u2019s  focus  on  poverty  reduction  by  channeling  resources  into  policy \npriorities,  as  reflected  in  the  NSEDP  and  the  Vision  to  2030.  Subprogram  1  is  categorized  as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The program has helped the government address the need to \nbuild a foundation for gender-responsive budgeting, undertake gender capacity assessments in \nstrengthening  organizational  structures,  and  ensure  greater  representation  of  gender \nstakeholders in key PFM reform structures. Improved PFM will ultimately improve service delivery \nand  access,  and  thereby  benefit  the  poor,  women,  children,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. Implementation of medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting will also allow the MOF \nto more systematically integrate gender concerns into their budget process.32 \n \n22. \nGovernance. The government has made gradual, consistent progress in improving the \nregulatory environment for developing PFM. Since the enactment of the 2006 State Budget Law, \n\n                                                \n31 Subprogram 3 may be added during processing of subprogram 2, subject to further discussion with the government. \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nwhich  was  revised  in  2015,  PFM  policies  and  reforms  have  focused  on  enhancing  budget \ntransparency, developing a framework for medium-term planning, increasing the authority of the \nMOF in public finance and budget, and increasing budget stability. While more strengthening is \nneeded,  ADB  has  reinforced  this  momentum  with  continuing  support  to  improve  governance, \naccountability,  and  predictability  of  fiscal  and  budget  planning. 33 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n23. \nRisk  and  mitigation  measures.  Major  risks  and mitigating  measures  are  described  in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The expected net benefits and impacts \nof the program are expected to outweigh the risks. Political resistance to the reform initiatives may \nretard progress on policy actions or full realization of the program benefits. However, the risks are \nmoderate  because  of  the  government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  and  ownership  of  the  reform \nactions.  The  risks  are  also  mitigated  by  ADB\u2019s  TA,  which  targeted  MOF\u2019s  implementation  of \nmedium-term fiscal planning and budgeting (footnote 32).  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n24. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nagreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \n25. \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Strengthening  Public  Finance  Management \nProgram, and \nthe loan of $45,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for subprogram \n1 of the Strengthening Public Finance Management Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  in  concessional  terms,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  \n1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of  \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n3 September 2019 \n\n                                                \n33  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  \n\n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nPublic  services  for  achieving  the  NSEDP  goals  sustainably  financed  (The  Eighth  National  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2016\u20132020).a \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nResults Chain \n\nEffect of the \nReform \nPFM and fiscal \nposition \nstrengthened  \n\nReform Areas \n1.
