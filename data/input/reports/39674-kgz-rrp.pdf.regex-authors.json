The Torugart post is a major border \ncontrol and customs facility between the Kyrgyz Republic and the \nPRC.  The  road  condition  is  poor;  border-crossing  facilities  and \nprocedures  are  outdated  and  inefficient,  and  they  obstruct \ninternational  traffic  and  trade.  Improved  road  and  customs \ninfrastructure will remove the obstruction and open up this corridor \nfor wider regional trade and economic cooperation. It will reduce \ntravel and transit times from the current 3\u20134 days to 2 days.  \n \nImprovement of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will be implemented in \nthree phases and includes (i) improving 488 km of the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road in the Kyrgyz Republic and the 20 km Bishkek bypass \nroad,  (ii)  modernizing  infrastructure  and  facilities  at  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2013PRC  border  crossing  at  Torugart,  and  (iii)  policy  and \ninstitutional  support  in  the  road  subsector.  This  proposal  is  for \nProject 1 (the Project), the outputs of which are (i) an improved 39-\nkm road section from Km 400 to Km 439 of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad, (ii) modernized customs infrastructure at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013\nPRC border crossing at Torugart, (iii) a transport sector master plan \nfor 2010\u20132025, and (iv) a fully operational Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road \nCorridor Management Department (BTRMCD). \n   \nRationale  Regional cooperation in Central Asia has centered on transport, \nenergy, and trade facilitation for the last decade since the launch of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB)-sponsored CAREC Program in \n1997. This proposal supports transport and trade facilitation under \nCAREC.  Endorsed  under  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade ", "ii   \nFacilitation Strategy, the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road forms part of the \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1. It is the shortest road link from Kashi, \na vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, to consumer markets \nin  the  northern  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Kazakhstan,  and  Russian \nFederation. As part of the Silk Road that linked ancient China to the \nWestern world, it also represents an important historical heritage. \n \nDevelopment of the transport sector is a priority of the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic (the Government), as reflected in its Country \nDevelopment Strategy for 2007\u20132010. Substantial investments of \nabout $350 million were made in the last decade to rehabilitate the \ncountry\u2019s major road corridors. Along with these investments, the \nKyrgyz  Republic  has  also  made  progress  in  reforming  transport \nsector operations. It adopted the Road Sector Development Strategy \nfor 2007\u20132010, increased road financing, and plans to outsource and \nprivatize road maintenance operations. Improvement of the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart  road  is  a  priority  investment  project  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy. \n \nADB is the lead partner in developing the transport sector in the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  Joint  Country \nSupport  Strategy  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (2007\u20132010).  It  will \ncomplement  ADB-led  investment  and  policy  dialogue  in  the \ncountry and complete a key transport corridor connecting Bishkek, \nthe capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, to Kashi in the PRC. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  costs  and \nfostering regional trade and tourism between the Kyrgyz Republic \nand the PRC. The outcome is improved access to markets, social \nservices, and tourist destinations. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $30.3 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.0 million.  \n \nAmount \nItem \n($ million) \nRoad Improvement  16.5 \nCustoms Infrastructure Modernization  1.5 \nProject Management Support  2.3 \nPolicy and Institutional Support  1.0 \nDuties and Taxes  4.0 \nContingencies  5.0 \nTotal    30.3 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.

The \nproposed grant will finance 66% of the cost. The Government will \nprovide counterpart financing of $10.3 million to cover taxes and \nduties, part of the civil works for road improvement, and the civil \nworks for customs infrastructure modernization works. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 30 September 2012 \n   \nEstimated Completion  31 March 2012 \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n   \nImplementation  Project implementation units for various donor-assisted projects \nArrangements  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC) \nwere  centralized  in  2007  under  the  Investment  Projects \nImplementation  Department,  which  will  implement  the  road \nimprovement component. The existing project implementation unit \nunder the State Customs Committee will implement the customs \nmodernization  component.  Through  the  project  implementation \nunit, the State Customs Committee will report to MOTC on the \nimplementation  status  and  activities,  and  obtain  MOTC\u2019s \nclearance for payments to contractors and suppliers. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed with the ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Contracts estimated to cost in excess \nof $500,000 equivalent for goods and $1.0 million for civil works \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding. Civil \nworks for the road improvement component have been packaged \ninto  one  contract  to  be  financed  by  ADB  following  ADB\u2019s \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Civil works for the \ncustoms infrastructure improvement (estimated to cost less than \n$1.0  million)  will  be  financed  by  the  Government  following  its \nprocurement  procedures.  Customs  operations  and  control \nequipment (estimated at $1.0 million) will be procured through \nADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The \nGovernment has been advised that before the commencement of \nany procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB \nand the Government will review the national public procurement \nlaw to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n ", "iv   \nAny necessary modifications and clarifications will be reflected in \nthe procurement plan. A tentative procurement plan was prepared \ncovering the first 18 months of the Project.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Implementation  of  the  Project  will  require  the  services  of \nconsulting firms for construction supervision, project monitoring \nand  evaluation,  and  preparation  of  subsequent  phases.  The \nProject will require input of a team of international (46 person-\nmonths) and national (137 person-months) consultants, who will \nsupervise  the  civil  works  and  provide  on-the-job  training  for \ncounterpart staff. A simplified technical proposal with quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  to  select  the \nconsultants. In addition, the following advisory consulting services \nwill  be  required:  (i)  23  person-months  of  international  and  35 \nperson-months of national consulting services for preparation of a \ntransport  sector  master  plan,  and  (ii)  30  person-months  of \ninternational and 50 person-months of national consulting services \nfor  institutional  support  to  BTRCMD.  Quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  with  a  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for \nselection of advisory consultants. The services of an independent \naudit firm will be required for financial audit of project accounts. \nThe  firm  will  be  engaged  following  least-cost  selection \nprocedures. All consulting services to be financed by ADB will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  By  improving  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  the  Project  will \nBeneficiaries  substantially reduce the existing obstruction to trade and foster \nregional economic cooperation. The entire region will benefit from \nthe  Project,  while  the  project  area  will  gain  through  economic \ndevelopment and increased access to markets and social services. \nImproving the project road will reduce transport costs, contribute to \ncommercial  and  industrial  development,  develop  tourism,  and \ngenerate employment opportunities. The overall economic internal \nrate of return of the Project is 14.7%, and the net present value is \nabout $37.8 million. The Project is expected to help boost trade \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. The total volume of \nbilateral trade is expected to grow from 0.5 million tons in 2007 to 3 \nmillion tons in 2015, of which the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at \nTorugart is expected to contribute more than half. \n \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, by \nstimulating economic development, it will have poverty reduction \nimpact and benefits. While the Project aims to facilitate regional \ntrade and thereby benefit major businesses and those involved in \ntrade  and  commerce,  it  will  also  significantly  benefit  rural \ncommunities and especially rural poor. Specifically, the Project will \nindirectly benefit 2.3 million people living along the project road, 51% \nof whom are women dominant in intra- and inter-oblast (province) \ntrade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the \nthree oblasts where the project road passes have poverty levels ", "  v\nbelow the national average of 46%. Extreme poverty in these two \noblasts is almost double the national average of 13.5%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Key  assumptions,  on  which  the  Project  design  is  based,  are  (i) \ncontinued political stability and strong economic performance in the \nKyrgyz Republic; (ii) continued commitments of the governments of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC to regional cooperation and to \ncompleting improvement of  the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor; (iii) \ncontinued external assistance to the road subsector in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic; and (iv) implementation of the cross-border agreement \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The main project \nrisks include (i) projected international traffic may not materialize, and \n(ii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices for construction \nmaterials and labor. Given current economic development in the \nregion  and  trends  in  trade  and  transport  turnover  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  it  is  anticipated  that  projected  traffic  levels  will  indeed \nmaterialize.  It  is  expected  that  the  economies  of  the  regional \ncountries will grow at least at the same pace as currently, and growth \nis likely to accelerate further. Price escalation factors were adjusted \nfor current trend in world prices for major construction inputs and \nincorporated into the cost estimates to minimize the risk of project \ncost overrun. Based on these assumptions and the likelihood of \nrisks, the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh its \ncosts. \n ", "KYRGYZ 6R9 o E00'PEUBLIC Shu KaskeAllemnaty to Astana 79 o 00'E\nKAZAKHSTAN\nCAREC TRANSPORT CORRIDOR 1 Tyup\n(BISHKEK--TORUGART ROAD) PROJECT Dzhergalan\nKara\nDzhambyl Balta ShopokoBvISHCKHEUKI Tokmok Cholpon-Ata Lake Issyk-Kul Kara Kol\nBalykchy\nMaimak\nTalas ISSYK-KUL\nKochkorka\nTALAS\nShymkent\nChaek\nKAZAKHSTAN Toktogul Lake Song-Kul\nToktogul Reservoir KYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nKarakul NARYN\nNaryn\nTerek Sai JALAL-ABAD\n40 o 00'N Tash Kumyr 40 o 00'N\nShamaldy Sai\nTashkent Kochkor Ata At Bashy\nSAMARKAAnNgDren NAMANNaGmAaHngan ANDIZHAN JALAL-ABAD Lake Chatyr-Kul PEOPOLEF' S C  HRIENPAUBLIC\nAndijan Kara Su Uzgen\nAlmalyk Torugart\nOsh\nMargheelan\nDJIZAK Gulistan Takeli Kokand FERGANA Gulcha to Urumqi\nUZBEKISTAN SYRDARYA Bekabad Kanibadam Fergana Kyzyl KiyNaaiman OSH\nIsfara Frunze Sopu Kurgon N\nDjizzak Khujand Shurab Batken Atush\nSpitamen Kashi\nSAMARKAND Haidarkan Jordan Sary Tash\nIstaravshan Sulyukta Vorukh BATKEN Irkeshtam 0 50 100\nSamarkand Daroot-Korgon Kilometers\nAyni\nPendzhikent SUGHD  REGION Nimich Dzhirgatal Karaart National Capital\nNavobod Garm TAJIKISTAN Lake Karakul Regional Capital\nKASHKADARYA REGIONS OF\nOklya REPUBLICAN Tavildara City/Town\nSUBORDINATION Nurobod\nCAREC Transport Corridor 1\nDUSHANBE Vahdat Obigarm Darvoz CAREC Transport Corridor 3\nFaisabod Lake Sarez\nTursunzoda Nurek Nilvan Murgab Bishkek--Torugart Road - Project 1\nSURKHANDARYA GORNO-BADAKHSHAN Bishkek--Torugart Road - Project 2\nAUTONOMOUS  REGION\nDenau Dangara\nBishkek--Torugart Road - Project 3\nSarband\nProjects Financed by Other Donors\nKulyab\nKurgan-Tyube KHATLON Khwahan Project Financed by ADB and Cofinanciers\nREGION BADAKHSHAN\nHamadoni Shighnan Khorog Main Road\nTermez DzhilikulPyandzhDarqad Railway\nNizhniy Pyandzh\n37 o 00'N Shakhrituz River 37 o 00'N\nShortepa Kaldar SBhairnkdhaarn Rustaq Faizabad Baharak Wakhan Regional Boundary\nHairatan Ayvadzh KUNDUZ TAKHAR Ishkashim Autonomous Regional Boundary\nBalkhBALKH Konduz Taloqan Keshem Eshkashem International Boundary\nCA Mazar-e-Sharif AFGHANISTAN Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nR\ns\n 08-14 Sholgara Samangan Baghlan Nahrin Kuran Wa Munjan\n47 HR DaraS-iA-SMuAfNGAN to Kabul69 o 0B0A'EGHLAN NURESTAN 79 o 00'E\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Regional  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  has  centered  on  transport,  energy,  and  trade \nfacilitation  for  the  last  decade  since  the  launch  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nsponsored  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  in  1997.  This \nproposal supports transport and trade facilitation through improvement of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart \nroad and a major border control and customs facility between the Kyrgyz Republic and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The 500 kilometer (km) Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is part of \nCAREC Transport Corridor 1, which is identified in the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy.1 It is the shortest road link from Kashi, a vibrant cultural and trade center in the PRC, \nto consumer markets in the northern Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, and Russian Federation. As \npart of the Silk Road that linked ancient China to the Western world, it also represents an \nimportant historical heritage. \n \n3.  The road condition is poor and border-crossing facilities and procedures are outdated and \ninefficient, thus obstructing international traffic and trade. Improvement of the project road and \ncustoms infrastructure at Torugart will remove the obstruction and open up this corridor for wider \nregional trade and economic cooperation. It will reduce travel and transit times from the current 3\u20134 \ndays to 2 days. Feasibility and social studies were undertaken under ADB technical assistance \n(TA) projects. 2 The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1.   \n  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Regional Trade and the People's Republic of China as Trading Partner \n4.  Fueled by robust economic growth in Central Asia and the PRC, Central Asian countries \nhave experienced increasing trade among themselves, and predominantly with the PRC. Trade \nvolumes in Central Asian countries have more than doubled since 1999, with total freight \nturnover growing from 145 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 1999 to about 300 billion ton-km in \n2006. The PRC has emerged as a major trading partner, with its share in the total imports of \nCentral Asian countries3 exceeding 20% in 2006. A remarkable increase in trade with the PRC \nhas  been  exhibited  by  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (with  15-fold  growth  from  2001  to  2005)  and \nTajikistan (with 20-fold growth in the same period). The PRC\u2019s growing investments in Central \nAsia, particularly in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, will further boost trade. Once the project \nroad and associated border infrastructure and procedures are improved, the road share of \nimports from the PRC will grow significantly and the proportion of exports will pick up gradually, \nespecially once negotiated and potential mining and resource concessions to Chinese investors \nbecome operational in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n \n5.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade volume with the PRC rose from 141,606 tons (81% of total \ntrade) in 2002 to 540,147 tons (92% of total trade) in 2007.  More than half of the total trade \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2007. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2008.

Kyrgyzstan in Figures. Bishkek. \n \n2.  Transport Sector Performance \n6.  Roads dominate the transport sector of the Kyrgyz Republic, accounting for about 94% \nof freight tonnage movements and almost all passenger traffic. The railway network consists of \ntwo separate branch lines, one linking the north of the country to the Kazakhstan\u2019s rail system \nand another linking the south to Uzbekistan\u2019s rail system, with no direct link between the two. Air \ntransport accounts for less than 1% of passenger movements, and these are mainly between \nBishkek and Osh. Water transport is confined to a few vessels on Lake Issyk-Kul. \n \n7.  The demand for transport has fallen dramatically since the country\u2019s independence in \n1991. The lowest levels were reached in 1995, when the volume of freight in ton-km was only \n14% of its 1990 level and passenger movement was 33% of its 1990 level, reflecting a sharp \ndecline in real incomes and output. In 2001, freight turnover (measured in ton-km) was only \n20% of its 1990 levels and passenger turnover was 57%. Demand grew steadily after 2001, with \nthe railway\u2019s share increasing from one third of the total freight turnover in 2001 to almost one \nhalf by 2006 (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Transport Turnover Statistics (2001\u20132006) \nTransport Mode  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nFreight Transport (million ton-kilometers) \nRailways  331.6  394.6  561.7  714.9  661.8  752.0 \nRoads  1,050.5  875.1  797.2  847.4  835.1  864.0 \nAir  49.6  38.8  42.8  45.5  42.4  34.2 \n  Total  1,431.7  1,308.5  1,401.7  1,607.8  1,539.3  1,650.2 \nPassenger Transport (million passenger-kilometers) \nRailways  50.0  43.1  49.8  45.3  46.1  61.5 \nRoads  4,774.1  4,857.3  5,090.9  5,407.3  5,684.8  5,936.4 \nAir  381.4  341.9  410.5  458.9  421.2  360.2 \n  Total  5,205.5  5,242.3  5,551.2  5,911.5  6,152.1  6,358.1 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n8.

About 40% of the \nrepublican roads are paved, 50% are gravel, and the remaining 10% are dirt roads. \n \n9.  Due to a backlog in road maintenance and insufficient funding in the past two decades, the \nroad network is estimated to have lost about $1 billion in road assets. Based on survey data of \n2005, two thirds of 4,300 km were in critical condition, and one fifth of the surveyed roads were so \ndegraded that rehabilitation of the asphalt pavements was impossible. Only urgent action can \nprevent further degradation of the road infrastructure. Cognizant of this, the Government of the \nKyrgyz Republic (the Government) has set improvement and maintenance of road infrastructure \nas one of its priorities and has embarked on a Road Sector Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010 \n(RSDS),4 which proposes eight medium-term tasks with an objective of improving access to \nregional and local markets. These tasks are (i) rehabilitation and adequate maintenance, (ii) \ntransport independence, (iii) improvement of the road financing system, (iv) involvement of the \nprivate sector in road construction and maintenance, (v) involvement of local communities in \nmaintenance of local roads, (vi) institutional reforms, (vii) improvement of road safety, and (viii) \nuse of modern technologies in road management and monitoring. RSDS also lists eight prioritized \ntransport corridors in the Kyrgyz Republic, which include the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road, with the \ntarget of improving 35% of the road up to international standards by 2010.  \n \n10.  To implement the RSDS, the Government estimated that (i) investment of $490 million \nwould be needed to rehabilitate the remaining two key regional corridors (i.e. the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road and Osh\u2013Isfana road); and (ii) annual maintenance funding of $48 million would \nbe required for MOTC administered roads. While funds for improvement of regional corridors \nwill be sourced mainly from international financial institutions, financing road maintenance at the \nrequired level remains a challenge. However, the Government has made progress towards \nachieving the required level of financing. The total allocation for roads has increased 11-fold \nsince 2000, and has tripled since 2005 (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector (2000\u20132007) \n(Som \u2018000) \nItem  2000  2003  2005  2007 \nCapital Investments  38,919  93,219  209,350  319,430 \nRoad Maintenance  74,339  99,996  221,674  1,058,758 \nAdministration  16,683  29,624  40,790  78,700 \n  Total  131,941  224,842  473,819  1,458,895 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n11.  The Road Fund enacted in 1998 has never truly functioned. Taxes are collected in the \nname of the Road Fund but are consolidated under the Government\u2019s central budget. With the \ndecree in 2003, the Road Fund Council was responsible for overseeing the management of the \nRoad Fund, but it never met. The RSDS suggests the need for clearer and predictable financing \nmechanisms, including full functionality of the Road Fund and revisions to the revenue structure \nand sources. Several countries have introduced second-generation road funds with independent \nboards and management representing the interests of main stakeholders and road users. Unlike \nfirst-generation  funds  that  received  earmarked  revenues  with  service  delivery  following \ntraditional models, these funds have adopted the following commercially oriented principles: (i) \n                                                 \n4 Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2007.

RSDS supports these principles and calls for changes in road financing. A review of \nthe existing Road Fund and preparation of a strategy for commercialization of road financing \nand management are being pursued under the CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject.5 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Constraints in the Transport Sector \n12.  Strategically  located  in  Central  Asia  and  given  the  fast-growing  economies  of  its \nneighbors (i.e. Kazakhstan and the PRC), the Kyrgyz Republic has potential to play a key role in \nbringing the external markets closer to Central Asia. Its transport infrastructure\u2014constrained by \nthe  country\u2019s  landlocked  nature  and  mountainous  terrain\u2014suffers  from  frequent  climatic \ncalamities,  operates  inefficiently  with  substantial  maintenance  backlog,  and  faces  severe \nshortages in capital investment. At the same time, it is confronted with growing demand for \nregional  access  and  trade.  Key  challenges  that  the  Government  face  to  fully  realize  its \naspirations of becoming a conduit for regional trade are (i) removing barriers to regional trade, \n(ii) building efficient and integrated transport systems, and (iii) catching up on the accumulated \nshortfall in sector financing and investment. As the country\u2019s transport sector is dominated by \nroad transport, these challenges are directly linked to the road subsector. An analysis of the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic is in Appendix 2. \n \na.  Barriers to Regional Trade  \n13.  Road conditions are poor and customs infrastructure and facilities at the Torugart border \npost do not comply with international standards, and need modernization. Border crossing is \noften delayed due to inadequate customs facilities and complicated procedures. Travelers are \nrequired to go through clearance at the border by several government agencies, including those \nresponsible for border control, customs, sanitary, and transport. This results in the prolonged \nborder crossing and travel time from Bishkek to Kashi takes up to 4 days. This situation \nconstitutes a major barrier to regional trade. Improved roads and customs infrastructure, as well \nas  efficient  cross-border  procedures\u2014such  as  a  single-window 6 service  and  automated \nclearance of border traffic\u2014 would help remove this barrier to ensure free flows of traffic and \nboost trade and commerce.\n \n \n14.  The Kyrgyz Republic, as an active member of the CAREC Program, has committed to \n\u201cworking  together  for  trade  openness,  transport  corridors  for  integrating  the  region  and \nconnecting to external markets, and for developing and sharing the region\u2019s energy resources\u201d \nduring the Fourth Ministerial Conference in Bishkek in 2005.7 The CAREC Transport and Trade \nFacilitation Strategy (footnote 1) calls for (i) establishing competitive transport corridors across \nthe CAREC region; (ii) facilitating efficient movement through corridors and across borders; and \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

Cross-border \ntransport procedures are being addressed under the Regional Customs Modernization and \nInfrastructure Development Project,8 and a cross-border agreement between Kyrgyz Republic, \nPRC, and Tajikistan will be developed under the CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject (footnote 5). Developing a harmonized transport regulatory framework is one of the \ntasks undertaken by the CAREC Transport Sector Coordination Committee. Major improvement \nof road corridors and efforts for better sector funding and management are under way, with \nassistance of ADB and other donors.  \n \nb.  Inefficient Transport Systems \n15.  Despite  the  recent  progress,  the  transport  system  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  remains \ninefficient mainly because of (i) weak strategies and regulations, (ii) inefficient planning and \nmanagement, and (iii) limited institutional capacity.  \n \n16.  Weak  Strategies  and  Regulations.  ADB  has  been  intensively  involved  in  policy \ndialogue with the Government in the past decade, and played an instrumental role in introducing \nmarket-based reforms in the transport sector and developing transport policy statements.9 While \nRSDS was the first step in defining the priorities to achieve road sector development, it largely \nremains a short-term output-oriented document with weak links to available financial resources. \nA comprehensive and coherent long-term strategic master plan is needed with emphasis on \ndevelopment of efficient and integrated transport systems.   \n \n17.  Inefficient Planning and Management. Planning and management practices in the \ntransport sector remain inefficient. Priorities have been driven by the imperative to link different \nparts of the country or provide regional access. ADB has assisted MOTC to introduce best \npractices through recently completed TA10 that aimed to help (i) set up highway information \nsystems  and  a  database,  (ii)  introduce  prioritization  tools,  and  (iii)  prepare  road  sector \nintervention  plans.  In  recognition  of  the  need  of  a  new  approach  to  sector  planning  and \nmanagement,  MOTC  was  reorganized  in  2007.  Its  current  organizational  structure  is  in \nAppendix  3.  Four  separate  agencies,  including  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  Road  Corridor \nManagement Department (BTRCMD), were set up to operate and maintain main international \nroad corridors. Two more agencies are expected to be established in 2008. Institutional support \nwill be needed to strengthen capacity of MOTC and help implement tasks outlined in RSDS, \nparticularly  those  relating  to  institutional  reforms,  road  management,  road  safety,  and \nintroduction of modern technologies for planning and monitoring.  \n \n18.  Limited Institutional Capacity. Constrained institutional capacity in the transport sector \nlimits the introduction of best practices on planning, management, operation, and maintenance. \nThe sector\u2019s financial management capacity is weak; and international accounting and auditing \nprocedures have yet to be followed. Despite the growing need, the sector is losing experienced \nmanagerial and technical personnel because of low salaries and lack of incentives. No effort \nhas  been  made  to  coordinate  with  the  academic  institutions  to  train  qualified  technical \npersonnel. Neither is there a strategy to supply professionals to meet the demand of current \nsector needs.   \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

Accumulated Financing Shortfall \n19.  The severe fiscal constraints in the Kyrgyz Republic have limited budget allocations for \nimproving and maintaining roads to only 20% of the required level. The Government relies \nheavily on external funding, which amounted to $350 million over the last 10 years. RSDS \nstates that the Kyrgyz Republic would need over $1 billion to rehabilitate its 2,242 km of major \nroad  corridors  and  $48  million  for  annual  maintenance  over  the  next  5  years  to  bring  its \ndevastated  road  network  back  into  a  maintainable  condition.  This  is  a  challenge  to  the \nGovernment. The way forward is to raise sufficient revenues by introducing revenue-generating \nmechanisms and involve the private sector to efficiently utilize available funds. To address some \nof  the  above  issues,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive long-term transport sector master plan. The Project will contribute to reducing \nthe shortfall in capital investment in the Kyrgyz Republic and will develop a transport sector \nmaster plan. \n \n2.  Government Strategies  \n20.  Development of the transport sector is a high priority of the Government as reflected in \nits Country Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010. It calls for developing international road \ncorridors  to  facilitate  regional  trade  and  transit  traffic,  as  well  as  establishing  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks to encourage private sector participation in transport. The Government\u2019s \npolicy  directives  also  require  developing  the  transport  sector  based  on  market-oriented \nprinciples to improve efficiency.  \n \n21.  Substantial  investments,  as  mentioned  in  para.  19,  were  made  to  rehabilitate  the \ncountry\u2019s major road corridors. Along with these investments, the Kyrgyz Republic has also \nmade progress in reforming transport sector operations. It adopted the RSDS, increased road \nfinancing,  and  plans  to  outsource  and  eventually  privatize  road  maintenance  operations. \nImprovement  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  is  a  priority  investment  project  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy. \n \n3.  ADB Strategy  \n22.  ADB is the lead partner in developing the country\u2019s transport sector. The Project is fully \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CAREC  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program.11 The  Project \nsupports two of the four strategic objectives identified in the regional cooperation strategy and \nprogram: (i) increasing trade and integration with large markets in South Asia, PRC, Iran, Turkey, \nand Russian Federation; and (ii) improving economic cooperation to reduce transport costs and \nfacilitate trade and transit, allowing Central Asian countries to become integrated and use their \nlocation to their advantage. Development of the transport sector is also a priority area in the Joint \nCountry Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007\u20132010).12 The Project will complement \nADB-led investment and policy dialogue in the country and complete a key transport corridor \nconnecting its capital Bishkek to Kashi in the PRC. \n \n4.  External Assistance \n23.  The Project is the sixth road project for ADB financing in the Kyrgyz Republic. ADB \nassistance to the road subsector, which totals $210 million, was provided for rehabilitating roads \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

The \nWorld Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the \nPRC have also extended assistance. In recognition of the need for close coordination, key \ndonors to the Kyrgyz Republic have jointly prepared a strategy (footnote 12), which identifes \nroad subsector development and regional cooperation as priorities for assistance. The external \nassistance provided to the road subsector is summarized in Appendix 4.  \n \n24.  The  Government  is  seeking  loans  from  the  PRC\u2019s  Export-Import  Bank  of  China  to \ncomplement ongoing improvement of sections of CAREC corridors in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nincluding $75 million for improvement of the Osh\u2013Irkeshtam road and up to $200 million for the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road. A long stretch (about 2,800 km) of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 that \ncrosses Kazakhstan from east to west will be improved with assistance of ADB, European Bank \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, and World Bank.  \n  \n5.  Lessons  \n25.  A project of similar size and scope\u2014the ADB-financed rehabilitation of the Bishkek\u2013Osh \nroad in the Kyrgyz Republic13\u2014was implemented in three phases over 10 years. Each phase was \nseparately prepared through ADB technical assistance followed by detailed engineering designs \nand the bidding process. Despite the complexity and geographical challenges, the project was \nimplemented successfully at a total cost of about $265 million. However, benefits accrued to the \neconomy of the country could have been greater if the project had been implemented more \nexpeditiously. The proposed fast-tracked phased approach for the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road Project \nwill help shorten the implementation period as described in para. 30.  \n \n26.  The project completion report (draft) for the Third Road Rehabilitation Project14 indicates \nthat the capacity of MOTC (the project\u2019s executing agency) remains weak in managing the bidding \nprocess and contract administration, and monitoring social and environmental impacts. Integrated \nhuman  resource  planning  and  adequate  skills  are  the  cornerstones  for  success  in  building \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  unless  the  Government  has  developed  a  comprehensive  sector \ndevelopment  strategy  that  is  based  on  sound  human,  technical,  and  financial  resource \ndevelopment targets, it is difficult for the executing agencies to get support from the central \nGovernment for investing in sustainable human resource development initiatives. The Project will \ndevelop such a strategy as part of the transport sector master plan (para. 31). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The Project will contribute to reducing transport costs and fostering regional trade and \ntourism  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC.  The  outcome  is  improved  access  to \nmarkets, social services, and tourist destinations. \n                                                 \n13 Financed through three ADB loans: ADB. 1996.

The Project outputs will comprise: \n \n(i)  improved 39-km road stretch from Km 400 to Km 439 (within Char Pass\u2013Ak Beit \nPass  section),  including  earthworks,  pavement  and  drainage  works,  and \nreconstruction of one bridge; \n(ii)  modernized customs infrastructure at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border crossing \nat Torugart, including rehabilitation and repair of customs facilities, provision of \ncustoms operations and control equipment;15 \n(iii)  a transport sector master plan (2010\u20132025) adopted by the Government; and  \n(iv)  fully operational Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road Corridor Management Department. \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  Improvement of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will be implemented in a fast-tracked phased \napproach comprising three phases and includes (i) improving 488 km of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road \nin the Kyrgyz Republic and the 20-km Bishkek bypass road, (ii) modernizing infrastructure and \nfacilities at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border crossing at Torugart, and (iii) policy and institutional \nsupport in the road sector. Outputs for the first project are specified in para. 28. Subsequent \nphases will (i) improve remaining sections of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road, (ii) upgrade the 20-km \nBishkek bypass road, and (iii) construct an interchange at the Bishkek bypass road (at Km 9) to \nease traffic congestion and improve road safety. \n \n30.  For  efficient  and  fast-tracked  implementation  of  all  project  phases,  the  following \napproach is adopted and built into the project design: \n   \n(i)  full feasibility of improving the entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is appraised as part \nof the due diligence for the first project; \n(ii)  preceding projects include resources and management support components for \npreparation of succeeding projects, which include updating the initial feasibility \nstudy; preparing detailed designs, specifications, and bidding documents; and \nsocial and environmental safeguard documents; and \n(iii)  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  that  allows  the \nexecuting agency to proceed with contracting and implementation prior to grant \neffectiveness.   \n \n31.  To build an efficient and integrated transport system, the Government needed to formulate \na  long-term  transport  sector  development  strategy.  Hence,  the  Project  will  provide  advisory \nconsulting services to prepare a holistic transport sector master plan targeting sector investment \nand noninvestment priorities for 2010\u20132025. The master plan will (i) build on the existing country \nand sector strategies; (ii) refine the policy framework for the transport sector; (iii) develop long-term \ninvestment programs in road, railway, and civil aviation subsectors; and (iv) lay the ground for \ndevelopment of intermodal services. \n  \n32.  The Project also includes advisory consulting services to help MOTC strengthen the \ncapacity of BTRCMD (para. 17), introducing (i) adequate institutional arrangements, (ii) effective \nroad asset planning and management systems, (iii) a reliable emergency response system, and \n(iv) best practices in effective operation and management of corridor assets.  \n                                                 \n15   The initial list of equipment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", "    9 \nD.

Financing Plan \n34.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a grant not exceeding $20 million from its \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the Project. The proposed grant will finance 66% of the \nproject cost. The Government will provide counterpart financing of $10.3 million to cover (i) all taxes \nand duties, (ii) part of the civil works for road improvement, and (iii) civil works for customs \ninfrastructure modernization. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 5, and detailed in \nAppendix 5. \n \nTable 5: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount  % \nAsian Development Bank  20.0  66 \nGovernment  10.3  34 \n  Total    30.3  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants16 provided \nthat, for countries eligible for grant assistance, the percentage of ADB financing on a grant-basis \nin the country will be based on such country\u2019s debt-distress classification. The Kyrgyz Republic \nis classified as a country with high risk of debt distress and therefore is eligible to receive \nfinancing on a 100% grant-basis.  \n \n36.  While the Project will improve first 39-km stretch of the road, the investment cost of \nimproving the entire road from Bishkek to Torugart is estimated at about $210 million (Appendix \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n ", "10  \n9, Table A9.4). As available external funding to the Kyrgyz Republic is limited to loans on \nconcessional terms or grants due to the country\u2019s high debt-distress classification, a substantial \namount of cofinancing from other donors would be needed. The Government is seeking up to \n$200 million from the Export-Import Bank of China and may tap into other donor funds17 to \nsupplement subsequent phases of improving the entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart road. As financing \nfrom these sources has yet to be confirmed, ADB has programmed $30 million for 2009 and \ntentatively $40 million each for 2010 and 2011 from the Special Fund resources to help finance \nthe Bishkek\u2013Torugart road improvement.    \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  MOTC,  which  is  currently  an  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  ongoing  ADB-financed \nproject18, will serve as EA for the Project. MOTC has implemented several ADB-financed road \nrehabilitation  projects  and,  with  support  of  the  project  consultants,  has  developed  required \ncapacity to effectively implement the Project. Project implementation units for various donor-\nassisted  projects  under  MOTC  were  centralized  in  2007  under  the  Investment  Projects \nImplementation Department (IPID). IPID will implement the road improvement components, and \nthe existing project implementation unit (PIU) under the State Customs Committee (SCC) will \nimplement the customs modernization component. Through the PIU, SCC will report to MOTC the \nimplementation status and obtain MOTC\u2019s clearance for payments to contractors and suppliers. \nThe  directors  of  IPID  and  the  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of \nimplementation  activities.  Additional  staff\u2014including  professional  staff  with  experience  in \nprocurement, road engineering, construction supervision, and environment, and support staff\u2014will \nbe added to IPID prior to the award of the civil works contracts in order to support implementation \nactivities. IPID will also be responsible for advance procurement action activities. MOTC and SCC \nwill coordinate closely during project implementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.  All three projects will be implemented over 6.5 years from July 2008 to December 2014, \nincluding  advance  procurement,  mobilization  and  implementation,  plus  the  defects  liability \nperiod (the period during which the contractor is responsible for maintenance). Civil works for \nthe first project are scheduled to start in July 2009 and to be completed by March 2012 \n(including mobilization and one year defects liability period). Subsequent projects will follow \nsimilar  timing  with  about  1  year  lag.  The  tentative  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n39.  All procurement to be financed with the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts estimated to \ncost in excess of $500,000 equivalent for goods and $1.0 million for civil works will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB).

The \nGovernment has been advised that, before the commencement of any procurement activity under \nnational competitive bidding, ADB and the Government will review the national public procurement \nlaw to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications and \nclarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. A procurement plan was prepared covering \nthe first 18 months of the Project (Appendix 7).  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n40.  Implementation of the Project will require services of consulting firms in the fields of \nconstruction supervision, project monitoring and evaluation, and preparation of a subsequent \nproject. The Project will require input of a team of international (46 person-months) and national \n(137 person-months) consultants, who will supervise civil works and provide on-the-job training \nfor counterpart staff. A simplified technical proposal with quality-  and cost-based selection \nmethod will be used to select the consultants. A weighting system of 80% for quality and 20% \nfor cost will be applied. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8. In addition, \nthe following advisory consulting services will be required: (i) 23 person-months of international \nand 35 person-months of national consulting services for preparation of a transport sector \nmaster  plan,  and  (ii)  30  person-months  of  international  and  50  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services for institutional support to BTRCMD. Quality- and cost-based selection with \na simplified technical proposal will be used for selection of advisory consultants. The outline \nterms of references for consultants for the transport sector master plan are in Supplementary \nAppendix B, and for the institutional support to BTRCMD in Supplementary Appendix C. The \nservices of an independent audit firm will be required for financial audit of project accounts. The \nfirm  will be engaged following least-cost selection procedures. All  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced by ADB will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n41.  To expedite the bidding process, ADB Management has, in principle, approved advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing from the grant proceeds for expenditures incurred on \neligible civil works and consulting services. Advance contracting allows the Government to \ncommence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the grant agreement. The \nGovernment was informed that, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be \neligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the grant \nbecomes effective, up to 20% of the grant proceeds may be used to retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of the grant \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  adopted  under  advance \ncontracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the grant becomes effective. \nThe  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses. \n \n ", "12  \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n42.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n43.  For greater transparency and accountability, the Government will disclose to the public, \nand update annually, the current status, annual financial statements, and future plans of the \nRoad Fund through the local media and on the websites of Ministry of Finance and MOTC. \nMOTC will also disclose (i) its annual financial statement of the funds it receives from the central \nbudget; and (ii) the status and implementation progress of all donor-funded investment projects, \nincluding,  among  other  things,  procurement  activities,  bidding  and  recruitment  procedures \nadopted, amounts of contracts awarded, a list of goods and/or services purchased, and their \nintended use. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  All disbursements of the ADB grant under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate \nproject  implementation  and  funds  flow,  imprest  account  will  be  established  upon  grant \neffectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used to finance \nADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  MOTC  will  manage  an  imprest  account.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. To expedite funds flow and \nsimplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures procedure will be used for \nliquidating and replenishing the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding $50,000 \nper payment. The payments in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be liquidated \nor replenished based on the supporting documentation process.  \n \n45.  Financial  management  assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  of  the  EA  was \nconducted and it concluded that the associated risks are low due to the EA's adequate experience \nwith  donor-funded  projects.  IPID  has  adopted  an  accrual  accounting  system  supported  by \nstandardized accounting software. MOTC is subject to three levels of audit: (i) an internal audit by \nthe Department of Economic and Financial Planning and Control, (ii) a statutory audit by the \nChamber of Accounts of the Kyrgyz Republic, and (iii) a mandatory external audit for ADB-\nfinanced projects by an independent audit firm. IPID will closely monitor the physical and financial \nprogress of the Project in accordance with ADB policies and guidelines. ADB will reserve the right \nto verify the financial accounts of IPID and related parties. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The EA will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and \nthe Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor that has adequate knowledge \nand experience of international accounting practices and is acceptable to ADB. The audited \nproject accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of \n ", "    13 \neach financial year. The auditor\u2019s report should include a separate opinion on the proper use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. The Government has been \ninformed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited project accounts and financial \nstatements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. The EA will \nprepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on project implementation, the \nform and content of which will be agreed with ADB. To facilitate evaluation of the Project, the \nGovernment  will  provide  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n47.  ADB and the EA will agree upon a preliminary set of indicators for monitoring and \nevaluating project performance in relation to its impact and outcome prior to its commencement. \nRepresentative indicators are included in the project design and monitoring framework. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, the EA will confirm baseline values for economic, social, \nand environmental impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will be measured, with the necessary \nfrequency, during project implementation. Comments and findings regarding these indicators \nwill  be  incorporated  in  every  other  quarterly  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  indicators  for \nimplementation monitoring, indicators for project evaluation will be measured at completion of \nthe  Project,  and  1  and  3  years  after  completion.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place, and the results will be compared \nwith the baseline values. A final report will consist of an evaluation of changes that occurred in \nthe preceding 3 years. The EA has developed the capability to monitor the Project. To facilitate \nassessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impact of the Project, an international \nconsultant will be recruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n10.  Project Review \n48.  ADB and the Government will jointly carry out a midterm review of implementation of the \nProject 16 months after commencement. The review will focus on outputs, particularly those \nrelating  to  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects.  The \nProject\u2019s economic viability and other aspects that may have an impact on overall performance \nwill be assessed after completion of the Project, or as necessary during implementation. The \nreview  will  examine  the  implementation  progress  of  the  reforms  and  compliance  with \nassurances specified in the Grant Agreement. \n \nG.  Stakeholders\u2019 Participation and Consultation \n49.  During the project preparation activities\u2014including ADB missions, feasibility studies, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and social surveys\u2014consultations were carried out with the \nGovernment,  nongovernment  organizations,  local  communities,  road  users,  external  aid \nagencies, and other project stakeholders. These consultations covered major issues such as \nroad alignment, transport services, project benefits, and social and environmental impacts of the \nProject. The results showed a high degree of support from project stakeholders. Consultations \nwith the stakeholders are summarized in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n ", "14  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n50.  By  improving  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  the  Project  will  substantially  reduce  the \nexisting obstruction to trade and will foster regional economic cooperation. The entire region will \nbenefit from the Project, while the project area will gain through economic growth and increased \naccess to markets and social services. Improving the project road will reduce transport costs, \ncontribute  to  commercial  and  industrial  development,  develop  tourism,  and  generate \nemployment opportunities. \n \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n51.  Traffic forecasts for the Project were based on the following three key assumptions: (i) \npolitical stability and strong macroeconomic performance in the Kyrgyz Republic, (ii) continued \ncommitment of the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC to regional cooperation, \nand  (iii)  continued  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The \nforecasts were made for the 2009\u20132032 period and are based on expected growth in gross \ndomestic  product,  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns \n(Appendix 9). Passenger traffic volumes are expected to grow at an annual average rate of \n10%, and freight traffic volumes are expected to grow at annual average rate of 12%. After road \nimprovement, additional traffic will be diverted to some sections of the project road from exiting \ndiversions and parallel roads. It is assumed that diverted traffic will constitute about 30\u201340% of \nnormal traffic. Generated passenger traffic has been estimated at 15% of normal traffic, and \ngenerated freight traffic at 20% of normal traffic.  \n \n52.  International  traffic  is  minimal  at  present  but  it  is  expected  to  grow  rapidly  after \nimprovement of the project road. Based on an analysis of trade patterns between the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and the PRC, international generated traffic is projected to grow from the current 80 \ntrucks per day to over 200 trucks per day by 2015 (85% of the total traffic). Total international \ntraffic is projected to reach 1,500 vehicles per day by 2032. Other international traffic may be \ndiverted from rail or other modes of transport, or other CAREC transport corridors. Potential \nbenefits related to such traffic are uncertain at this stage and therefore disregarded in this \nanalysis.   \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n53.  The economic analysis entailed projecting costs and benefits for with- and without-\nproject scenarios in accordance with ADB guidelines.19 The difference between the with- and \nwithout-project  cost  and  benefits  streams  represents  the  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic analysis covers 25 years (2009\u20132032), comprising 5 years of construction and 20 \nyears  of  operation.  The  least-cost  option  was  selected  among  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives and various pavement treatment options. Details of the economic analysis are in \nAppendix 9. \n \n54.  The major benefits of the Project are (i) reduced road user costs through savings in \nvehicle operating costs and travel and transit times; (ii) induced roadside industrial, commercial, \nand tourism development; and (iii) increased mobility and access to social services for local \ncommunities  along  the  road  corridor.  The  project  costs  include  the  resource  cost  of  road \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.. Manila. \n ", "    15 \nimprovement and maintenance throughout the project life, which were estimated in financial \nterms and factored by 0.8520 to convert them to economic terms. Both costs and benefits are \nexpressed in US dollars at mid-2008 price levels. \n \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 14.7%, and the net \npresent value is about $37.8 million, using a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis tested the \neffects of negative changes in key parameters determining project benefits and costs. The \nresults of the sensitivity analysis show that the Project would maintain economic viability with an \nEIRR  of  12%  under  various  adverse  scenarios.  The  most  adverse  scenario  entails  the \ncombined  effect  of  surging  oil  prices  and  therefore  reduced  traffic  demand  coupled  with \nsustained inflation for construction inputs, which reduces the EIRR to 9%. To mitigate this effect, \ndue diligence for subsequent phases of improving the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will need to \ncarefully  examine  prevailing  prices,  inflation  trends,  and  road  conditions  to  ensure  that \nimprovement options are aligned with economic sustainability requirements. The Project is \nexpected to help boost trade between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. The total volume of \nbilateral trade is expected to grow from 0.5 million tons in 2007 to 3 million tons in 2015, of \nwhich the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at Torugart is expected to contribute more than half.  \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impacts  \n56.  The Project is not a targeted poverty intervention, but it will have poverty reduction impact \nand  benefits  by  stimulating  economic  development.  The  results  of  the  social  and  poverty \nassessments undertaken are presented in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in \nAppendix  10.  While  the  Project  aims  to  facilitate  regional  trade  and  thereby  benefit  major \nbusinesses  and  those  involved  in  trade  and  commerce,  it  will  also  significantly  benefit  rural \ncommunities and especially rural poor. Specifically, the Project will indirectly benefit 2.3 million \npeople living along the project road, 51% of whom are women dominant in intra- and inter-oblast \n(province) trade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the three oblasts through \nwhich the project road passes have poverty levels that are below the national average of 46%; \nextreme poverty in these two oblasts is almost double the national average of 13.5%.  \n \n57.  The project road passes mostly through rural areas of the Kyrgyz Republic, where \nagriculture is the main source of income and poverty incidence is among the highest in the \ncountry.  Residents  considered  improvement  of  the  road  as  one  of  their  top  priorities  for \ndevelopment. Those to benefit most would be people whose livelihoods are directly linked to the \nroad, such as truck owners and drivers, shuttles and/or taxi services, merchants, owners and \nemployees of caf\u00e9s, fuel stations, maintenance shops, and farmers. Increased labor and trade \nmobility in the area will lead to increased incomes and employment opportunities for the local \ncommunities. Overall, connectivity is seen as increasing transboundary transport and tourism \ndevelopment, thereby augmenting local employment and incomes. The immediate benefits of \nthe Project are the opportunity for laborers in road construction works. \n \n58.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  in  the  early  stages  of  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  However, \nHIV/AIDS  has  still  been  identified  as  a  potential  risk.  A  public  awareness  campaign  for \nHIV/AIDS prevention will be included as part of project management. The EA, with the help of \nproject  supervision  consultants,  will  design  specific  links  with  national  and  donor-assisted \nHIV/AIDS prevention programs, and will monitor implementation. Specific provisions will be \nincluded in the bidding documents for civil works requiring contractors to conduct health and \n                                                 \n20 Economic conversion factor is adopted from a previous ADB-financed project in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n ", "16  \nsafety program for workers employed under the Project and the risk of sexually transmitted \ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS. \n \nC.  Social Safeguards  \n59.  The Project classification for resettlement impact is category C. All civil works will take \nplace  within  the  existing  right-of-way  or  on  unused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of \nhouseholds or acquisition of productive land is expected. If the Project needs new borrow pits or \nquarries, these are expected to be located on unused state-owned land.  \n \n60.  The project classification for impact on indigenous people is category C. In 2005 the \npopulation in the project area consisted of 99% Kyrgyz and other nationalities including Uzbek, \nUygurs, Russians, Tajiks, and Tatars. Although the cultures and languages of these groups \ndiffer, there are many similarities. They have lived in the same region for a long time and have \nbeen  integrated  in  the  same  economic  and  social  structure.  Moreover,  the  project  road \nalignment touches only the Kyrgyz settlements and none of them will be adversely affected. \nThere are no groups with characteristics of indigenous people (as defined by ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples [1998]) affected by the Project.  \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts  \n61.  The environmental classification for the Project is category B. The initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines.21 Based  on  results  of  the  IEE,  the  Project  is  not \nexpected  to  generate  significant  environmental  impacts,  provided  the  mitigation  measures \noutlined in the IEE and environmental management plan (EMP) are implemented appropriately. \nThe summary IEE is in Appendix 11. The EMP as detailed in the IEE and outlined in summary \nIEE includes mitigation measures and a monitoring program for both the construction and \noperation phases of the Project.  \n  \n62.  The Government will ensure that the level of environmental impact from improvement of \nthe project road will be kept to a minimum, especially in those areas of high ecological value. This \nwill be achieved through effective monitoring and supervision of construction activities, as well as \nimplementation of all  necessary environmental mitigation  measures.  All contracts will clearly \nidentify the environmental responsibilities of all parties and the Government will enforce these \ncontractual requirements. All works will be carried out in accordance with the environmental laws \nand  regulations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies,  procedures  and \nguidelines, specifically ADB's Environment Policy. \n \nE.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n63.  The Project was designed with reasonable assumptions and taking into account the risks \nthat  could  prevent  the  Project\u2019s  intended  impact  and  outcome  from  fully  materializing.  Key \nassumptions are (i) continued political stability and strong economic performance in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic; (ii) the commitments of the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC to regional \ncooperation and to completing improvement of Bishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor; (iii) continued \nexternal assistance to the road subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic; and (iv) implementation of the \ncross-border agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan with ADB assistance \n(footnote 5).   \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "    17 \n64.  The Project may be exposed to the following risks: (i) the forecast international traffic \nmay not materialize, and (ii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices for construction \nmaterials and labor. Given the current economic development in the region and trends in trade \nand  transport  turnover  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  forecast  traffic  levels  are  anticipated  to \nmaterialize. The economies of the regional countries are expected to grow at least at the same \npace as currently, and growth is likely to accelerate further. Price escalation factors were \nadjusted for current trend in world prices for major construction inputs and incorporated into the \ncost estimates to minimize the risk of project cost overrun. Based on these assumptions and the \nlikelihood of risks, the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh its costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Ministry of Transport \nand Communications have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal \ndocuments: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  designed, \nimplemented, maintained, and monitored in compliance with (a) all applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations; (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); and \n(c) the EMP, including the mitigation measures and monitoring requirements \narising from the implementation of the IEE. The Government will also ensure \nthat (a) civil works contractors\u2019 specifications include requirements to comply \nwith the environmental mitigation measures contained in the IEE and EMP, \nand (b) civil works contractors are supervised to ensure compliance with the \nrequirements of the IEE and EMP. \n \n(xii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  No  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities are expected. However, if such activities are required, the Government \nwill ensure that land acquisition and resettlement are carried out promptly and \nefficiently following the resettlement plan agreed with ADB in line with applicable \nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is \nmonitored, evaluated, and reported to ADB as required in the resettlement plan. \nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way  required  for \nimplementation of the Project are made available in a timely manner. \n \n(xiii)  Local  consultation  and  gender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  local \nconsultations  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  issues  during  Project \nimplementation  are  carried  out  as  recommended  in  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy. The Government will further ensure that men and \nwomen are given equal employment opportunities directly, or indirectly, arising \nfrom the Project and without any differentiation of wages for equal work.

Road Infrastructure \n \n1.  The road network in the Kyrgyz Republic covers all seven oblasts (provinces), and \nprovides  connections  to  remote  communities  and  links  to  neighboring  countries.  The  road \nnetwork comprises 34,720 kilometers (km) of roads, 18,810 km of which are public roads and \n15,910 km of which are urban, rural, agricultural, industrial, and other roads. The road network \nof the Kyrgyz Republic carries about 95% of the country's passenger and freight traffic. The total \nlength of international roads is 4,163 km, national roads total 5,678 km, and local roads total \n8,969 km; the length of paved public roads is 7,228 km, comprising 11 km of cement-concrete \nroads, 4,969 km of asphalt roads, and 2,248 km of bitumen treated gravel roads. The total \nlength of gravel road is 9,961 km, and there is 1,621 km of unpaved roads.   \n \n2.  About 18,800 km of roads (9,800 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads) are \nunder the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) (Table A2.1). \nAbout 40% of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over \n50% are gravel and less than 10% are earth roads. Since most of the roads were designed for \nhigher  traffic  capacity  and  are  underutilized,  the  existing  basic  transport  infrastructure  is \nadequate for the level of economic activity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the \nprimary  concern  is  not  expansion  or  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system,  but  proper \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  to  preserve  the  existing  network.  Roads  at  all  levels  are \ndeteriorating; over 60% now require periodic maintenance or rehabilitation.  \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of the Road Network (2007) \nBy Class  International  National  Local  Total \nLength (km)  4,163  5,678  8,969  18,810 \n%  22  30  48  100 \nBy Type  Paved  Gravel  Earth Road  Total \nLength (km)  7,228  9,961  1,621  18,810 \n%  38  53  9  100 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n3.  About 16,000 km of rural roads are outside MOTC\u2019s jurisdiction. Most were formerly the \nresponsibility of state and collective farms, but the responsibility for maintaining rural roads now \nlies with the district administrations following the break up of the state and collective farm \nsystem. \n \n4.  The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union. Due to a \nbacklog in road maintenance and insufficient funding in the past two decades, the road network \nis estimated to have lost about $1 billion in road assets. Based on survey data of 2005, two \nthirds out of 4,300 km were in critical condition. One fifth of the surveyed roads were so \ndegraded  that  rehabilitation  of  asphalt  pavements  was  impossible.  Only  urgent  action  can \nprevent further degradation of the road infrastructure.  \n \n5.  Cognizant of this, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (the Government) has made \nimprovement  of  road  infrastructure  one  of  its  priorities  and  embarked  on  a  Road  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy for 2007\u20132010 (RSDS), which proposes nine medium-term tasks with an \nobjective of improving access to regional and local markets. These included (i) rehabilitation and \nadequate maintenance, (ii) transport independence, (iii) improvement of the road financing system, \n(iv) involvement of the private sector in road construction and maintenance, (v) involvement of local \n ", "  Appendix 2  23 \ncommunities in maintenance of local roads, (vi) institutional reforms or a road management system, \n(vii) improvement of road safety, and (viii) use of modern technologies in road management and \nmonitoring. It also lists eight prioritized transport corridors in the Kyrgyz Republic, which include the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road with the target of improving 35% of the road according to international \nstandards by 2010. The Bishkek\u2013Osh and Bishkek\u2013Georgievka roads were improved with funding \nfrom the Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, and Japan Bank for International \nCooperation. Improvement of the Osh\u2013Isfana road is being pursued under World Bank auspices. \nThe Government is also finalizing a program for improving local roads. \n \n6.  Most  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance date from the Soviet era. Although the standards are based on sound technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof such standards for a market-based economy is widely recognized; they need updating to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base of the country. \n \nB.  Vehicle Fleet \n \n7.  The motorization rate in the Kyrgyz Republic is low by international standards. The \nvehicle fleet numbered about 271,000 in 2007, including around 229,000 cars and buses, and \n41,700 trucks (Table A2.2). This was equivalent to 54 vehicles per 1,000 people. The vehicle \nfleet has recently grown rapidly at an annual rate of 5%. This trend is projected to gain further \nmomentum with continued strong economic growth in the country. The rapid increase in vehicle \nfleet size will require development or improvement of road infrastructure.  \n \nTable A2.2: Vehicle Fleet \nVehicle Type  1992  1995  2000  2005  2006  2007 \nCars/buses  176,643 200,043 191,423 202,520 220,359  229,644\nTrucks  77,845 68,394 54,638 42,679 41,566  41,716\n  Total  254,488 268,437 246,061 245,199 261,925  271,360\n     Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nC.  Institutions \n \n8.  The Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administration \nof road policies, programs, and projects to MOTC, which is responsible for policy, regulation, \nplanning,  and  development  of  transport  and  communications,  including  road,  railway,  and \naviation  sectors.  To  increase  efficiency  and  in  line  with  RSDS  objectives,  MOTC  was \nreorganized  in  2007.  It  plans  to  gradually  devolve  its  operational  functions  to  a  multilevel \nexecuting body. Its current organizational structure is in Appendix 3. Four separate corridor \nmanagement agencies to replace existing regional roads departments were established; two \nmore agencies are expected to be established in 2008. These corridor agencies are responsible \nfor operation and maintenance of the core international road network and roads interconnecting \nwith them. The functions of the existing regional road agencies (PLUADs and UADs)1 will be \ndownsized  to  contractual  and  financial  oversight  for  MOTC,  while  58  existing  local  road \nmaintenance units are planned to be privatized as required under RSDS. \n  \n                                                 \n1 These are Russian acronyms for regional road maintenance department (PLUAD) and local road maintenance \nsubdivision (UAD) of PLUAD. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \n9.  Other important agencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for \nsix freight transport companies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; \nand (ii) technical agencies in various stages of divestment under MOTC\u2019s control, including the \nRoad Design Institute (Kyrgyzdortransproekt) and a small agency responsible for developing \nand testing new road construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \nD.  Financing and Maintenance \n \n10.  The Road Fund enacted in 1998 has never truly functioned. Taxes are collected in the \nname of the Road Fund, but are consolidated under the Government\u2019s central budget of the \nMinistry of Finance. The Road Fund Council, with the responsibility to oversee the management \nof the Road Fund, was decreed in 2003, but it never met. RSDS suggests the need for clearer \nand  predictable  financing  mechanisms,  including  full  functionality  of  the  Road  Fund,  and \nrevisions to the revenue structure and sources. \n \n11.  To implement the RSDS, the Government estimated that (i) investment of $490 million \nwould be needed to complete the rehabilitation of the remaining two key regional corridors, i.e., \nthe Bishkek\u2013Torugart road and Osh\u2013Isfana road; and (ii) annual maintenance funding of $48 \nmillion would be required for all MOTC-administered roads. While funds for improvement of \nregional corridors will be sourced mainly from international financial institutions, financing road \nmaintenance at the required level remains a challenge. However, the Government has made \nprogress towards achieving the required level of financing. The total allocation for roads has \nincreased 11-fold since 2000, and tripled since 2005 (Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Budgetary Allocation to the Road Subsector (2000\u20132007) \n(Som \u2018000) \nItem  2000  2003  2005  2007 \nCapital Investments  38,919  93,219  209,350  319,430 \nRoad Maintenance  74,339  99,996  221,674  1,058,758 \nAdministration  16,683  29,624  40,790  78,700 \n  Total  131,941  224,842  473,819  1,458,895 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n12.  Based on the survey results of 2005, about 502 out of 2,231 km of surveyed roads are in \ngood condition, 133 km are satisfactory, 250 km are unsatisfactory, and 1,346 km of roads are \nin critical condition. About 200 km of paved roads are lost annually due to inadequate financing \nfor maintenance in the past; about 1,000 km were lost during the last 5 years.  \n \n13.  In 2003, the total budget allocation to MOTC for roads was Som224.8 million (or $5.15 \nmillion). This figure was slightly increased in 2004 to Som278.6 million due to emergency costs. \nIn addition, the funds allocated for road maintenance constitute less than 30% (27.4% in 2003) \nof the total allocation to the road sector when external financing for capital investment projects is \ntaken  into  account.  However,  if  only  budget  allocation  is  considered,  road  maintenance \nallocation to MOTC represents 60\u201365% of the total. The total road sector financing from all \nsources is shown in Table A2.4. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nTable A2.4: Financing for Road Sector (2004\u20132007) \n(Som \u2019000) \nItem    2004  2005  2006  2007 \nA.

Annual allocation for road maintenance is made up of two parts: the original allocation \nand supplementary allocation. The original allocation in 2003 was Som157.37 million. Usually in \nmid-year, following requests for emergency repairs (mostly due to landslides), a supplementary \nbudget is allocated. In 2003, an additional amount of Som67.5 million was allocated to MOTC \n(Som41.5 million for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and Som26 million for the rest of the network). Over \nthe  years,  the  supplementary  budget  varied  while  the  original  budget  remained  relatively \nconsistent. \n \n15.  The average road maintenance expenditure of the MOTC network is $375/km, where \nfunds are highly skewed towards the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. This amount is far lower than the \nusually quoted figure of $2,000/km needed to adequately maintain a road network. Moreover, \nonly 20% of the maintenance work is routine maintenance, giving a very low average figure of \n$60/km for the network. In some cases, roads have deteriorated so much that the size of \npotholes does not permit any further routine maintenance and major repairs are needed. \n \n16.  The Bishkek\u2013Osh Road Directorate accounts for approximately 10% of the total network \nbut received 40% of the annual budget allocation. On a per-kilometer figure, it means that in \n2003 the Bishkek\u2013Osh road spent $1,327/km while over the rest of the network only $257/km \nwas spent.  \n \nE.  Road Safety \n \n17.  Recognizing  that  road  safety  is  critical,  the  Government  stressed  the  need  for \nimprovement in this area in RSDS as one of the major tasks and set a target to reduce the \ncurrent rate of accidents from 22 fatalities per 1,000 vehicles to 17 during 2008\u20132010. The \nPermanent Secretariat for Road Safety, established in 2004 under the Asian Development Bank \nassistance, has been actively working to revise existing road safety guidelines and prepare the \nNational Road Safety Program, which is expected to be approved in late 2008. The Road Safety \nSecretariat has identified an alarming national problem of road accident injuries and property \ndamage.  \n \n18.  Increased motorization contributes to a higher number of accidents, with the fatality rate \ngrowing steadily. Analysis of accident data shows that speeding and reckless driving are the \nmajor factors contributing to high fatality rates. The poor road network condition is also a major \ncontributor. Accident statics over the past 10 years are shown in Table A2.5.  \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.5: Road Traffic Accidents \nRoad   Number of  Number of \nYear  Accidents  Injuries  Fatalities \n1997  2,993  3,710  685 \n1998  2,864  3,453  585 \n1999  2,665  3,304  584 \n2000  2,670  3,292  610 \n2001  3,122  3,808  703 \n2002  2,966  3,561  725 \n2003  3,380  4,091  897 \n2004  3,275  3,969  892 \n2005  3,717  4,568  893 \n2006  3,911  4,948  1,051 \n2007  4,692  6,223  1,252 \n    Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nF.  Road Transport Services \n \n19.  The road transport service market is almost fully liberalized. The private sector plays a \nkey role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 80% of freight and \npassenger transport. The state-owned road transport operators were largely privatized and \nforeign road transport operators are allowed to set up their businesses. Freight charges and bus \nfares  for  domestic  road  transport  are  determined  based  on  market  conditions,  though  the \nGovernment is setting up tariffs and prices for urban passenger transport, and cross-border and \ninternational  transit  traffic.  The  Government  has  recently  introduced  vehicle  licensing  to \nenhance axle-load control and improve road safety.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nMANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE \nMINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS \nMinistry of Transport and \nCommunications  \nCivil Aviation Department  Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart Road \n42 staff (state budget)  Department,45staff(statebudget)\nState Enterprise \u201cKyrgyzaeronavigation\u201d  Bishkek\u2013Osh Road State Directorate,  \n74 staff (state budget)  84staff(statebudget)\nKyrgyzdortransproject Design Institute, \nKyrgyz Transport Inspectorate  \n130 staff (self-financing) \n141 staff (state budget) \nInternational Automobile Transport  State Enterprise \u201cSpecial \nDepartment \u201cKyrgyzintrans\u201d   Communication\u201d, 107 per.  \n89 staff (state budget)  (self-financing)\nState Enterprise for Bus Terminals and  State Courier Services,  \nStations, 368 staff (state budget)  69staff(statebudget)\nState Directorate on Design and  State Enterprise \u201cKyrgyzmarkasy,  \nConstruction of Railways  8 staff(self-financing) \n\u201cKyrgyzzheldorstroi\u201d  \n11 staff (state budget) \nState Enterprise \u201cGovernment \nCommunications\u201d, 20 staff   \nRegional Road Agencies (PLUADs)   (self-financing) \nNos. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 \n304 staff (state budget)  State Enterprise \u201cKyrgyzPost\u201d,  \n4,148 staff(self-financing) \nOsh-Sarytash-Erkeshtam Road \nDepartment,53staff(statebudget) Telephone Service Center,  \n13 staff (self-financing) \nState Scientific and Technological \nCenter, 24 staff (state budget)  Information & Communication \nTechnologies Center, 4 staff  \n(self-finaning) \n\u201cKyrgyzstan\u201d Air Company \n195 staff (self-financing) \nState Enterprise on Construction of \nKyrgyzstan Aba Joldoru Joint Stock  Roads, Road Structures and Elimination \nCompany, 460 staff (self-financing)  of Natural Disasters on Roads, 35 staff \n(self-financing) \nAir Carriers registered in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  \u201cKyrgyztelecom\u201d Joint Stock Company, \n7,004 staff \n(self-financing) \nLegal Entities Using State \nCommunications Resources  Manas International Airport Joint Stock \n  Company, 1,600 staff \n(self-financing basis) \nOsh\u2013Batken\u2013Isfana Road Department,  \n39 staff (state budget)  Communication Operators \n \n \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n \nLoan/TA/Project  Amount  Date \nNumber  Project Name  ($ million)  Approved \nA.

The Project will reduce transport cost by improving the Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road in the Kyrgyz Republic, which is part of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Transport Corridor 1,1 connecting the Kyrgyz Republic and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). The Project will be implemented in three phases during 2009\u20132013. \nThe entire road from Bishkek to the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border at Torugart is divided into \nnine homogenous sections for the purpose of economic analysis. Project 1 will improve about \n40 kilometers (km) of the road stretch from Km 400 to Km 439 (within Char Pass\u2013Ak Beit Pass \nsection). \n \n2.  The economic analysis examined the expected contribution of the project road to the \ncountry and region based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project.2 The economic analysis covers the \nperiod  of  2009\u20132032,  comprising  5  years  of  implementation  and  20  years  of  operation, \nexpressed in mid-2008 dollar price levels.  \n \nB.

Additional traffic will be diverted \nto (i) the Kuvaki Pass section (Km 146\u2013Km 214), upon completion of project 2; and (ii) the \nBishkek bypass road (Km 9\u2013Km 82), upon completion of project 3. It is estimated that about half \nof  the  heavy  trucks  travel  via  Balykchi,  making  an  additional  47-km  detour  due  to  road \nconditions and traffic safety restrictions at the Kuvaki Pass. Similarly, traffic between Bishkek \nand Buruldai travels along the two parallel alternatives roads. It is assumed that diverted traffic \nwill constitute about 30\u201340% of the normal traffic along the sections in question. Improved \nproject road conditions and facilities are expected to (i) reduce road user costs through savings \nin vehicle operating costs and travel and transit times; (ii) induce roadside industrial, commercial, \nand tourism development; and (iii) increase mobility and access to social services for local \ncommunities  along  the  road  corridor.  Hence,  generated  volume  for  passenger  traffic  was \nestimated at 7% of normal traffic, and generated freight volume at 10% of normal traffic.

Maintenance Costs. It was assumed that the existing gravel and/or paved surfaces \nwould require $1,200\u2013$1,350/km for annual routine and winter maintenance and regraveling at \nregular intervals. The paved road sections would require resealing with a single bituminous \nlayer every 5\u20137 years at an average cost of $35,000/km. The economic maintenance costs \nwere based on unit rates derived from ongoing operations and estimated quantities.  \n \n10.  Road User Costs. The Highway Development and Management Model HDM-4 was \nused as a basis for the analysis. The analysis focuses on savings in transport costs. Value \nadded from better transport links resulting in new industries and employment are not quantified \nspecifically, but are captured through benefits to generated traffic. Vehicle cost data by vehicle \ntype and road condition of each road section were used for projecting vehicle operating costs \nand road agency costs for the with- and without-project cases. The net present value (NPV) and \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) were calculated by section.  \n \n11.  Additional benefits, such as savings in environmental and road accident costs, were not \ncalculated as there is no reliable data and the current level of traffic on the project road is \nrelatively low. It is assumed that savings that could be accrued from these contributors are \ncurrently negligible.  \n                                                 \n3 Economic conversion factor is adopted from a previous ADB-financed project in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n ", "42  Appendix 9   \nD.

The sections from \nthe Kuvaki Pass to the Torugart Pass have a reasonable probability of meeting the 12% cut off,  \nand the EIRR for two sections is less than 12% because of the relatively low traffic and high \ncapital costs.  \n \nTable A9.5: Combined ENPV and EIRR for the Project \n($ million) \nEconomic Benefits \nNet \nB fit\n   Economic Costs  Normal + Diverted  Generated  Economic \nYear  Capital  Recurrent  VOC  Time  VOC  Time  Benefit \n2009  22.87  0.00  (6.12)  (0.01)  0.00  0.00   (25.98)  \n2010  54.44  0.00  (6.44)  (0.02)  0.00  0.00   (49.34) \n2011  57.56  0.00  (6.14)  (0.02)  0.00  0.00   (46.00) \n2012  36.07  0.00  (2.35)  (0.01)  0.12  0.00   (23.75) \n2013  10.08  0.42  2.53  0.06  0.38  0.01     (2.12) \n2014  0.00  0.76  8.16  0.07  0.69  0.01  9.01 \n2015  0.00  1.08  9.06  0.07  0.77  0.01  20.41 \n2016  0.00  1.08  5.09  0.06  0.45  0.01  5.61 \n2017  0.00  1.08  5.86  0.07  0.51  0.01  6.45 \n2018  5.85  1.08  6.61  0.07  0.57  0.01  5.41 \n2019  5.23  1.08  6.78  0.07  0.58  0.01  5.93 \n2020  7.84  1.08  7.79  0.07  0.67  0.01  6.68 \n2021  0.00  1.08  8.84  0.07  0.76  0.01  9.68 \n2022  0.00  1.08  9.85  0.08  0.84  0.01  15.53 \n2023  0.00  1.08  4.97  0.07  0.44  0.01  5.50 \n2024  0.00  1.08  5.12  0.06  0.45  0.01  5.63 \n2025  5.85  1.08  6.14  0.06  0.54  0.01  5.88 \n2026  5.23  1.08  7.01  0.05  0.61  0.01  7.01 \n2027  7.84  1.08  7.68  0.05  0.67  0.00  7.57 \n2028  0.00  1.08  8.91  0.05  0.77  0.00  9.74 \n2029  0.00  1.08  9.17  0.03  0.79  0.00  12.14 \n2030  0.00  1.08  4.09  0.05  0.37  0.00  4.51 \n2031  0.00  1.08  5.48  0.07  0.48  0.01  6.04 \n2032    (84.66)  1.08  6.22  0.08  0.55  0.01  12.32 \nNPV   134.19  20.54  114.33  1.19  12.02  0.13  37.80 \nEIRR              14.70% \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating costs. \nNote: Negative costs indicate incremental costs saved under the project would have been incurred without the \nProject. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \nE.  Sensitivity Analyses \n \n14.  The rate of return is sensitive to the increase in construction cost and reduction in traffic \ndemand. Looking at these factors individually, a cost increase of 30% would reduce the overall \nreturn to 12%, whereas reducing the annual traffic growth rate to 8% would bring the EIRR \nbelow  the  12%  threshold  value  for  economic  viability.  Assuming  world  prices  for  oil  and \npetroleum products continue to increase, and inflation for construction inputs remain high, the \ncombined effect of these factors would reduce the EIRR to 12% under the assumptions shown \nin Table A9.6. The most adverse scenario entails the combined effect of surging oil prices and \ntherefore reduced traffic demand coupled with sustained inflation for construction inputs, which \nreduces the EIRR to 9%. Hence, the due diligence for subsequent phases of improving the \nBishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  carefully  examine  prevailing  prices,  inflation  trends,  and  road \nconditions  to  ensure  that  improvement  options  are  aligned  with  economic  sustainability \nrequirements.  \n \nTable A9.6: Sensitivity Analysis \n  EIRR  NPV \nSensitivity Scenarios  (%)  ($ million) \nBase case  14.7  37.80 \nScenarios:     \n(i) Capital costs increase by 30%  12.0  0.14 \n(ii) Prices of petroleum products double  15.1  42.93 \n(iii) Combined effects of (i) and (ii)  12.3  5.27 \n(iv) Traffic growth reduced to 8%  11.1  (10.97) \n(v) Combined effects of (i), (ii), and (iv)  9.0  (44.14) \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "44  Appendix 10   \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Kyrgyz Republic/CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department \nProject \nModality:  Division:  Infrastructure Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project is one of the priority infrastructure projects identified in the Country Development Strategy for 2007\u20132010 \n(formerly National Poverty Reduction Strategy). It is also listed as a firm project in the country strategy and partnership for the \nKyrgyz Republic in 2008. Both the Asian Development Bank and the Government recognize the importance of regional \ncooperation to the landlocked Kyrgyz Republic, with trade, transport, and energy being the priority areas for socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  strategies  support  the  Government\u2019s  approach  to  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by balancing social goals with the need to stimulate growth through improving market access to rapidly \ngrowing neighboring markets and investing in agriculture to create economic opportunities in rural areas where most of the \npoor reside. The Project directly supports one of the goals in the country partnership strategy, which is to improve trade and \nroad linkages with regional markets. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, by stimulating economic development, it will have significant \npoverty reduction impact and benefits. While the project aims to facilitate regional trade and thereby benefit major businesses \nand those involved in trade and commerce, it will also benefit rural communities and especially rural poor.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nNo specific pro-poor design features are included under the Project.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project will indirectly benefit 2.26 million people living along the road, 51% of whom are women dominant in intra- and \ninter-oblast (province) trade and commercial activities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Two of the three oblasts through which the \nproject road passes have poverty levels that are below the national average of 46%. Extreme poverty in these two oblasts is \nalmost double the national average of 13.5%.  \n \nThe project road passes mostly through rural areas of the Kyrgyz Republic where agriculture is the main source of income \nand poverty incidence is among the highest in the country. Residents considered improvement of the road as one of their top \npriorities for development. Those to benefit most would be people whose livelihoods are linked to the road: truck owners and \ndrivers, shuttles and/or taxi services, merchants, owners and employees of caf\u00e9s, fuel stations, maintenance shops, and \nfarmers. Increased labor and trade mobility in the area will lead to increased incomes and employment opportunities for the \nlocal communities. Overall, connectivity is seen as increasing transboundary transport and tourism development, thereby \naugmenting local employment and incomes. The immediate benefits of the Project are the opportunity for laborers in road \nconstruction works. \n \nRoad improvement in the Kyrgyz Republic has special significance for women as they are extensively involved in trading for \nsupporting their families. Hence, women are the major road users in the country. Improvement of the road will have positive \nimpact on these women providing increased self-employment. The potential negative impacts on women as suspected are \nincreased risks of HIV infection and trafficking. Opportunities for women will be explored for income and employment in \nconstruction activities with equal wages, and their increased self-employment in business and trade. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  45 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nDuring preparation of stakeholder participation analysis, representatives of the Ministry of Transport and Communications and \ntechnical assistance consultants undertook socioeconomic surveys and public meetings at village, akimiat (village cluster), \nand/or rayon (district) levels. These surveys and meetings raised awareness and gained local support. There were extensive \nconsultations with the local communities at Naryn and At-Bashi in selecting the final road alignment, and due consideration \nwas  given  to  technical,  environmental,  social,  resettlement,  and  economic  impacts  of  the  selected  road  alignment. \nConsultations will continue throughout project implementation to address implementation-related issues.  \n \nBased on the results of consultations, the Project does not negatively impact people\u2019s livelihoods, social and cultural habits, \nincomes, and the way of participating in socioeconomic development activities of the local communities. Therefore, the \nProject does not involve sensitive social or participatory issues, nor there were concerns raised by the interested groups. \nProject stakeholders express support for the Project. A consultation and participation plan was therefore not required. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nGender assessment undertaken under the Joint Country Support Strategy (2007\u20132010) did not identify  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects as a potential area for widening gender inequality in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nWhile women stand to benefit from the Project, they are also likely to experience potential adverse social impacts, including \nincreased exposure to communicable diseases. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe project documents will have specific provisions to address (i) gender equality in employment opportunities related to civil \nworks, (ii) non-gender-based discrimination in labor standards, and (iii) gender dimensions of possible negative externalities \nof increased risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nIII.

The Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is about 500 kilometers (km) \ninternational road linking the Kyrgyz Republic with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s Country Development and Road Sector Development strategies for 2007\u2013\n2010  identified  rehabilitation  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  as  one  of  the  priority  tasks  in \ntransport sector. Therefore, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, acting through its Ministry \nof Transport and Communications (MOTC), has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other donors to provide financing for upgrading the road corridor in order to improve road \nsafety, achieve shorter travel times, lower vehicle operating costs, enhance the welfare of poor \npeople, and increase trade and transit links between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC.  \n \n2.  Improvement of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will be implemented in three phases. This \nproposal is for Project 1 of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project (the \nProject). The Project will improve the 39-km road stretch from Km 400 to Km 439 (within Char \nPass\u2013Ak Beit Pass section). \n \n3.  Summary Initial Environmental Examination. The initial environmental examination \n(IEE) report was prepared for sections of the road from Km 280 to km 480 (Dolon Pass\u2013Ak Beit \nPass) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines.1 This is the summary of \nthe IEE report. \n \n4.  Scope of Work. The scope of work is as follows: (i) collection of information related to \nthe environmental conditions along the proposed road section, (ii) assessment of potential \nenvironmental impacts, (iii) development of preventive and/or mitigation measures for significant \nimpacts,  (iv)  assessment  of  alternative  alignments  and  technologies,  (v)  elaboration  of \nenvironmental management and environmental monitoring plans (included in the IEE), and (vi) \npublic consultations. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n5.  Type and Category of Project. The Project includes improvement of the existing road \nand modernization of customs facilities. The activities include (i) earthworks and erosion control, \n(ii)  concrete  and  drainage  works,  (iii)  asphalt  concrete  works,  (iv)  ancillary  traffic  safety \nmeasures,  and  (v)  modernization  of  customs  infrastructure.  No  significant  realignments  or \ndevelopment of new alignments in previously undisturbed areas are expected. No construction \nand/or rehabilitation activities for feeder roads were included in the Project. The environmental \nclassification  for  the  Project  is  category  B  under  the  ADB  environmental  categorization \nrequirements.  \n \n6.  Location. The Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is located in the east\u2013central part of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and links its capital (Bishkek), Issyk-Kul and Naryn oblasts (provinces), and Xingjian \nUygur Autonomous Region of the PRC. The road sections covered by IEE are located in Naryn \nand At-Bashi rayons (districts) of Naryn oblast as shown in Figure A11. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "48  Appendix 11   \nFigure A11: Dolon Pass\u2013Ak Beit Pass Section (Km 280\u2013Km 480) \n \n \n7.  Magnitude of Operation. The road sections between the Dolon Pass and the Ak Beit \nPass will be designed as a two-lane road with the carriageway width of 7 meters (m) and the \nroad-bed width of 15 m (road category III, as per Kyrgyz Republic road standards SNIP 2.05.02-\n85).2 The proposed improvement options are: (i) road upgrading on the existing alignment; (ii) \nroad safety (road markings, road signs, and guide posts); and (iii) reconstruction of a number of \nbridges and culverts. \n \n8.  Alternatives  Considered.  If the no-action alternative is adopted, the existing road will \ncontinue to deteriorate, transportation costs and travel times will continue to increase, and access of \nlocal communities to markets in Bishkek will be affected. Alternatives on the location and the \ntechnology of improving the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road suggested in previous projects were: \n(i)  Providing  a  bypass  of  Naryn  town  from  the  west.  This  alternative  was \ndetermined not feasible as it runs through a residential part of the town for 6\u20137.5 \nkm and can cause substantial noise and air pollution, and reduce road safety.  \n(ii)  Landslide-prone area at Kyzyl-Bel Pass (Km 355\u2013Km 357). Three alternatives \nwere examined: providing a bypass of the landslide-prone section, a viaduct solution, \nand using the existing route. The Design Institute defined using the existing route in \ncombination with geotechnical measures towards landslide as the optimal alternative. \n(iii)  Providing a bypass of the At-Bashi Ridge from the east. This would require \nconstruction  of  a  long  section  of  new  road  through  a  remote  and  relatively \n                                                 \n2 SNIP is a Russian abbreviation for \u201cconstruction rules and regulations,\u201d a standard that extends to the design of \nnew roads and reconstruction of existing roads.   \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nundisturbed area. Construction of a new road was determined to be beyond the \nscope of the Project. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n9.  The  potentially  affected  environment  is  described  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines in terms of its physical, ecological, and socioeconomic resources, each \nof which is summarized below. \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n10.  Topography. The section is located within the mountain system of the Internal Tien-\nShan. The section begins near the Dolon Pass (altitude 3,030 m) at Km 280. From the Dolon \nPass the right-of-way (ROW) descends to the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge and continues to the \nMiddle Naryn Valley, where it passes through the eastern part of Naryn town (altitude 2,100 m) \nand crosses the Naryn River. A few kilometers further on, the section ascends to the Kyzyl Bel \nPass (altitude 2,500 m) and Char Pass (2,600 m), and crosses them to enter the At-Bashi \nValley. The section traverses the At-Bashi Valley parallel to the At-Bashi Ridge, until it reaches \nthe western part of the ridge. It then turns south and ascends to the Ak Beit Pass (altitude 3284 \nm), crosses the northern branch of the At-Bashi Ridge, and continues down to the Arpa Valley. \nThe final point of the section is located passed the Ak Beit Pass in the Arpa Valley at Km 476. \n \n11.  Geological and Seismic Characteristics. Geologically, the section is located within the \nMiddle Tien-Shan that is separated from the North Tien-Shan by so called \u201cNikolaev line\u201d. The \nline (fault) crosses the section several kilometers to the south of the Dolon Pass. The whole \nsection lies within the area where the probability of an earthquake is assessed as 8 , i.e., two \n2\nseismic events with a magnitude of 8 points on the Richter scale over 100 years. \n \n12.  Soils and Permafrost. The Project area comprises a number of soils that belong to \nsoils of mountain slopes and soils of intermountain valleys: mountain meadow steppe sub-\nalpine soil, mountain dark-chestnut soil, mountain light-chestnut soil, mountain  valley light-\nchestnut  soil,  mountain  light-chestnut  soil,  mountain  valley  light-brown  soil,  and  mountain \nmeadow steppe alpine soil. The top of the Dolon Pass (Km 282\u2013Km 283) and the Ak Beit Pass \n(Km 464\u2013Km 476) are located within island permafrost distribution areas. \n \n13.  Climate and Air Quality. The climate in the Internal Tien-Shan is continental with little rain, \ncool summers, and cold winters. Climatic conditions vary considerably with elevation. The average \nwinter temperature ranges from \u201325\u00b0\u0421 to \u201345\u00b0\u0421 (the lowest may exceed \u201354\u00b0\u0421), while in summer it \nvaries from 20\u00b0\u0421 to 30\u00b0\u0421. In winter frosts occur in all regions. Rain and snow usually fall in autumn, \nwinter, and spring. Average yearly precipitation is 230\u2013560 millimeters. The air quality is generally \ngood, except on unsurfaced sections where dust generated from passing vehicles was observed. \nThere are no ambient air quality monitoring stations in proximity to the section. \n \n14.  Hydrology. The alignment crosses the River Naryn, the largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nas well as two other major rivers, the At-Bashi and the On-Archa. On descent from the Dolon \nPass it runs parallel to the Karaunkur and Ottuk rivers. High groundwater tables occur in Kara-\nSuu and Ottuk villages. An initial visual assessment suggests that water quality is good. This \nappears to be confirmed by reports that the rivers support a healthy and diverse population of \nfish and macroinvertebrates. Chemical analysis and analysis of macrozoobenthos in major \nrivers  of  the  project  area  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  environmental  assessment.  The \nchemical analysis of samples from the Naryn, At-Bashi, On-Archa, and Karaunkur rivers was \n ", "50  Appendix 11   \nconducted in the laboratory of Kyrgyz Agency on Hydrometeorology. It was concluded that \nwater quality of all the samples was good, and pollutant concentrations were within acceptable \nstandards. The presence of a diverse range of macrozoobenthos species supports this finding. \n \n15.  Natural Hazards. Natural hazards related to the section include landslides, mudflows \nand seasonal flooding, rock falls, and avalanches. The section is susceptible to a massive \nlandslide in the proximity of the Kyzyl-Bel Pass at Km 355\u2013Km 356. The possibility of mudflow \nexists at Km 300, 306, 312, 451, and 455. At Km 460 the ROW is currently destroyed by a \nmudflow. Rock falls can pose a risk to the section at Km 285\u2013Km 303, and Km 354\u2013Km 355. \nAvalanche-prone areas are located in the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge at Km 287\u2013Km 313, and the \nKyzyl-Bel and Char passes at Km 353\u2013Km 362. \n \n16.  Noise and Vibration. The majority of the alignment runs through areas with no settlements, \nbut only mountains, hills, and open steppe. Rare settlements through which the road corridor runs \nare Naryn town and the villages of Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung. Although no \nsensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals were noted near the ROW, noise and vibration \nare the serious concern to the communities that were raised repeatedly during public consultations. \nDwellings are typically made of clay brick. For those located close to the roadside, noise and \nvibration from heavy trucks have the potential to significantly impact the houses and their occupants. \nAlso, it was noted during the field investigations that the actual speed of vehicles passing through \nthe settlements rarely matches the speed limits. This contributes to safety and noise problems. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n17.  Flora. The distribution of flora in the project area fulfills the vertical zoning rule. Sub-alpine \nmeadows are typical of the Dolon Pass; at lower altitudes they change to fescue steppe, artemisia \ndeserts, and cropland near Naryn town; fescue steppe occurs to the south of Naryn. The At-Bashi \nValley is largely cropland, which changes to fescue steppe in the western part of the valley. In the \nAk Beit Pass area the flora is typical high-altitude meadow steppe. In the Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk Gorge \nthe road passes through areas of Naryn forestry with floodplain and slope forests. \n \n18.  Fauna. The faunal associations dominant in the project area are shown in Table A11.1.  \n \nTable A11.1: Dominant Terrestrial Faunal Associations \n  Terrestrial Fauna \nArea  Amphibians Reptiles  Birds  Mammals \nred-mantled rose finch,  Tien-Shan shrew, \nDolon Pass    lidless skink \nrufous-backed redstart   narrow-skulled vole \nKaraunkur Gorge, Kyzyl- gray marmot, \nrock and white-capped \nBell Pass, east and west  green toad  lidless skink  mouse, gray \nbunting, linnet, chukar \npart of At-Bashi Valley  hamster  \nIsabelline and common  tolai hare, Siberian \nOttuk Gorge  green toad  steppe runner \nchat, pink-billed lark  jerboa \nMiddle Naryn Valley,  steppe \nwhite and yellow chat,  house mouse, gray \ncentral part of At-Bashi  green toad  runner, diced \nred-headed bunting  hamster \nvalley   snake \nIsabelline and common \nmole vole, marmot, \nAk Beit Pass  green toad  lidless-skink  chat, Hodgson's rosy \nnarrow-skulled vole \nfinch, snow finch \nSource: 1987.

Twenty-two ecosystems are distinguished in the Kyrgyz Republic, and \nseven  of  them  were  found  in  the  project  area.  An  assessment  of  ecosystems  health  by \nbiological indicators (in points, from 1 = poor to 3 = excellent) was undertaken as part of this \nIEE. Table A11.2 presents the results of the study. \n \nTable A11.2: Assessment of Ecosystem Health in the Study Area \nEcosystem  Assessment ( 1= poor to 3 = excellent) \nAlpine Sub-Alpine    2 \nMid-mountain Herbaceous   1.5 \nMid-mountain Spruce Forest  2.5 \nMid-mountain Floodplain Forest   2.3 \nMid-mountain Steppe (lower reaches of Karaunkur River)  1.5 \nMid-mountain Steppe (middle reaches of Karaunkur River)    2 \nHigh-Mountain Meadow Steppe     2 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.  Therefore,  the  condition  of  ecosystems  can  be  assessed  as  \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  Sensitive \necosystems identified by the survey are mid-mountain spruce forest, mid-mountain flood plain, \nalpine/sub-alpine and high-mountain meadow steppe. The survey reports also that the migratory \nroutes of hoofed mammals pass near the Ak Beit (Km 473\u2013Km 474) and Dolon passes (Km 283). \n \n21.  Protected Areas. The section does not run through any specially protected area. One \nprotected area is found close to the project area; this is the Salkyn-Tor State Natural Park, \nseveral kilometers to the east of the road corridor (Figure A11). According to International Union \nfor  Conservation  of  Nature  classification,  a  national  park  (category  II)  is  a  protected  area \nmanaged mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation.  \n \n3.  Socioeconomic Resources \n \n22.  Industry and Agriculture. Industry in the Naryn oblast is represented by the electric \npower industry, mining, food processing, and the construction materials industry. Naryn oblast is \nan important agricultural region, specifically in animal agriculture. It supports a large population \nof sheep and horses. In 2005, industrial production of Naryn oblast was Som754.1 million and \nagricultural production was Som4,786.1 million. \n \n23.  Tourism. Naryn oblast has vast tourist potential that is presently not exploited. Major \ntourist attractions in Naryn oblast are Tash-Rabat (a caravanserai dating to the 15th century), \nthe site of the ancient town of Koshoi-Korgon, and the high-altitude Song-Kul Lake.  \n \n24.  Land  Use.  The  Land  Code  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  specifies  the  following  land-use \ncategories: (i) agricultural land; (ii) settlement land; (iii) land of industry, transport, communication, \ndefense, and other nonagricultural purposes; (iv) lands of specially protected natural territories; (v) \nforest fund; (vi) water fund; and (vii) reserve land. The land use in the project area is mostly \nagricultural; pasturelands are prevalent in mountain areas, while croplands are prevalent in the \nvalleys. The Law on Highways specifies the category \u201cland of road transport\u201d. \n \n25.  Nontransport Infrastructure. Infrastructure within the section is represented by electric \npower lines, telecommunication lines, water supply systems, irrigation systems, and canalization \nsystems. As the section crosses nontransport infrastructure in Naryn and other portions of the \nProject area, coordination with the relevant authorities will be required. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 11   \n26.  Transport Networks. The Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road is an international road corridor \nand one of two roadways linking the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC. On a larger scale, the road is a \npart of CAREC Transport Corridor 1 linking Kashi in the PRC to Almaty in Kazakhstan. \n \n27.  Population and Communities. Naryn oblast\u2019s population was reported as 266,500 people \n(2006), the majority of whom (82.2%) live in rural areas. Communities served by the road include \nKaraunkur, Ottuk, and Naryn (in Naryn rayon), and At-Bashi, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung (in At-Bashi \nrayon) villages. Karaunkur (Km 295) is a small village comprising about 10 houses located in \nKaraunkur Gorge. There is one three-storey building and several clay-brick dwellings. Ottuk (Km \n314\u2013Km 316) is a larger settlement with a population of about 1300 people. Houses are mostly \nmade of clay brick. Naryn town (Km 347\u2013Km 352) with a population of about 40,000 is the largest \nsettlement. This stretch has both multi-storey buildings and small dilapidated houses. At-Bashi \n(population 11,300) is a rayon center several kilometers from the alignment. Other settlements in the \nproject area are Kara-Suu (Km 410) with a population of 4,540, and Karabulung (Km 417), with \n1,508 inhabitants; the alignment runs through both villages. People usually use clay brick to build \ntheir houses. Ak Beit is a very small village of five houses at Km 464. The ethnic composition in the \nproject area is homogeneous and consists of virtually only Kyrgyz people.  \n \n28.  Cultural and Historical Heritage. According to the List of Historical and Cultural Sites of \nNational Significance, there are 12 historical and archeological sites in Naryn rayon and 28 in At-\nBashi rayon. Although none of the sites are located within the ROW, some of them are within \nseveral kilometers of it. There are also about 10 Muslim graveyards in the proximity of the road.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n29.  Potential  impacts  have  been  identified  by  reviewing  each  relevant  parameter  and \nscreening out insignificant impacts from those that can have significant adverse impacts in the \nconstruction and operation phases of the project. It was concluded, as will be shown below, that \nthe implementation of the project will have significant social benefits and, if the prescribed \nmitigation  and  management  measures  are  fully  implemented,  it  is  unlikely  to  have  major \nadverse environmental impacts. \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n  a.   Topography \n \n30.  Impacts. Topographic impacts could occur due to altered road embankments, borrow-pit \nexcavations, and quarry operations.  \n \n31.  Mitigation. No significant cut and fill operations are required; therefore no significant \nimpacts to topographic characteristics are anticipated.  \n \n   b.    Soil and Permafrost \n \n32.  Impacts. Soil impacts may occur due to altered road embankments, borrow-pit excavations, \nand quarry operations. However, no significant cut and fill operations are anticipated. Provided that \nerosion prevention measures in the construction and operation phases are taken, no substantial \nadverse impacts to soils are foreseen. No long-term impacts to area soils due to increased pollutant \nlevels are anticipated. The permafrost island areas occur at altitudes of more than 3,000 m, \ntherefore potential impacts to the permafrost areas are likely to occur during construction and \noperation phases near the Dolon (Km 282\u2013Km 283) and Ak Beit passes (Km 364\u2013Km 376).  \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \n33.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures include integration of the geocryological considerations \ninto the detailed design by surveying at the pre-project stage the current condition of permafrost \nat the Dolon and Ak Beit passes, identifying and mapping areas of concern (if any), and \ndeveloping mitigation measures. The mitigation measures can include the avoidance of areas \nwith degraded permafrost and engineering measures.  \n \n    c.  Air Quality \n \n34.  Impacts. Air quality impacts could occur in both the construction and operation phases, \nbut no significant violations of standards are anticipated amid the provisions noted below.  \n \n35.  Mitigation. Contracts will require asphalt and hot-mix plants to be located at least 500 m \nfrom the nearest sensitive receptor (e.g., schools, hospitals, or communities), and they will not \nbe located within sensitive ecosystems identified above. Operators will be required to install \nemission controls. Blasting (if any) will be carried out using small charges, and dust-generating \nitems will be conveyed under cover. Road surfaces and excavation and construction sites will \nbe sprayed with water to keep them moist for dust control. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone \nwill be covered with tarpaulins to avoid spillage. Contracts will require pre-construction and \nroutine air quality monitoring. Construction sites, asphalt plants, quarries, and transportation \nroads will be monitored for total suspended particles during the construction phase. An ambient \nair quality monitoring station will be set up in Naryn town to monitor pollution in the vicinity of the \nroad corridor in the operation phase. (Currently there is no ambient air quality station in Naryn.) \nThe upgraded road will improve air quality and reduce dust emissions, as the sections of road \nthat do not have an asphalt surface will be upgraded and covered with asphalt. \n \n    d.   Surface and Groundwater \n \n36.  Impacts.  Surface  water  impacts  could  occur  during  construction  period  due  to  the \nerosion  and  construction  activities.  Provided  that  road  drainage  systems  are  improved, \nenhancement of water quality can occur at the operation phase. No impacts are anticipated to \navailability of water for domestic or agricultural use, except in Naryn town where water supply \npipelines may be temporarily impacted during construction. Potential impacts to local water \nsupplies  include  the  possibility  of  temporary  labor  camps  wastewater  disposal  during  the \nconstruction period. No impacts to groundwater resources are anticipated as a result of the \nproposed activities in the road corridor in either the construction or operation phases.  \n \n37.  Mitigation. The Project will install adequately sized drainage facilities to accommodate \nforeseeable flood levels and will stabilize downstream slopes with concrete or rock gabions or \nwalls to avoid erosion. Potential adverse impacts to the surface hydrology in construction phase of \nthe Project will be avoided through the enforcement of contract provisions. Contract provisions will \nensure that construction camps and other potential sources of secondary impacts are properly \nsited and provided with drainage and wastewater facilities. Water quality will be monitored by \nchemical analysis and bioindicators during construction and operational phases. Monitoring points \nwill be located at the Karaunkur, Ottuk, On-Archa, Naryn and At-Bashi rivers. \n \n    e.  Natural Hazards \n \n38.  Impact. Landslides, rock falls, avalanches, and mudflows may be triggered by different \nnatural and anthropogenic factors, pose hazards to people and infrastructure, and may block roads.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11   \n39.  Mitigation.  For  the  landslide-prone  area  (Km  355\u2013Km  357)  the  Design  Institute \nproposes using the existing road in combination with the geotechnical measures. Mitigation \nmeasures for rock fall-prone areas will include installation of rock fall retaining structures and \nrock fall warning signs as will be decided in the detailed design stage of the Project. Mudflows \nwill be mitigated by installation of box culverts. Artificial release of avalanches with artillery (a \ncommonly used method for avalanche control in the Kyrgyz Republic) will be used. \n \n    f.  Noise and Vibration \n \n40.  Impacts. According to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their houses. Special \nconcern is expressed over overloaded trucks transporting cargo to and from the PRC.  \n \n41.  Mitigation. A survey that includes baseline instrumental measurements of noise and \nvibration levels and damage susceptibility study will be conducted, along with the inspection of \nthe present condition of houses, at the preconstruction stage. In case of excessive noise or \nvibration  levels,  remedial  measures\u2014such  as  special  road  surface  design,  noise  barriers, \nplanting trees, or antivibration layers\u2014will be used along with monitoring. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n    a.  Flora \n \n42.  Impact. No threatened or endangered plant species are located in the potentially affected \nROW and no adverse impacts to such species are likely to occur due to the rehabilitation \nactivities. Plant species present within the ROW are either introduced species or ubiquitous native \nspecies,  which  are  highly  tolerant  of  grazing,  compaction,  and  other  physical  disturbances. \nConstruction activities will impact only a narrow band of vegetation adjacent to the existing road. \nNo substantial removal of trees or other vegetation is anticipated. \n  \n43.  Mitigation. The Project will include roadside planting to ensure slope stabilization. Existing \ntrees and roadside plants will be retained. Topsoil from borrow-pit areas will be saved and reused.  \n \n   b.   Fauna  \n \n44.  Impact. Habitat fragmentation as well as accidents involving wildlife can occur due to \nblocking  wildlife  migration  routes  near  the  Dolon  and  Ak  Beit  passes.  Construction  camp \nworkers and drivers can contribute to poaching or hunting wildlife.  \n \n45.  Mitigation. Mitigation will include an extended study of wildlife migratory routes during \ndetailed design stage and providing findings on exact locations of routes and behavior of wildlife \ntogether with recommendations on specific mitigation measures to the project implementation \nunit. Clauses should be written into construction contracts resulting in immediate dismissal and \nprosecution of individuals involved in poaching and wildlife hunting. \n \n   c.   Ecosystems \n \n46.  Impact. The field assessment of ecosystems conducted within the frame of the IEE shows \nthat,  whereas  no  significant  impacts  are  anticipated  for  mid-mountain  steppe  and  meadow \necosystems as they have already experienced broad-scale changes as a result of overgrazing, mid-\n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nmountain  flood-plain  and  meadow  ecosystems  in  the  Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk  Gorge  and  sub-alpian \necosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes) are at a greater risk of degradation.  \n \n47.  Mitigation. Mitigation measures to reduce risks posed to ecosystem health include siting of \nconstruction camps, asphalt plants, and other related facilities outside environmentally sensitive areas.  \n \n    d.  Protected Areas \n \n48.  Impact. No direct impacts to the Salkyn-Tor State National Park are anticipated. The \nProject could have an indirect impact on the national park by attracting more tourists. The \npotential impact is perceived as beneficial and within the environmental management capacities \nof the national park administration. \n \n3.  Socioeconomic Resources \n \n  a.  International Trade \n \n49.  Impact.  The  improvement  of  the  road  is  anticipated  to  have  positive  impacts  for \ninternational  trade  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC  and  other  countries  by \ndecreasing the transportation costs and travel time. Modernization of the customs infrastructure \nand complementary measures from the Government to improve customs procedures\u2014such as \nenforcement of overloading regulations, longer hours of operation, and also introduction of one-\nwindow  operation  whereby  all  transactions  are  undertaken  together\u2014will  facilitate  border \ncrossing and also result in decreased transportation costs and travel time. \n \n    b.  Industry, Agriculture, and Services \n \n50.  Impact. The improved road and modernization of customs facilities and procedures will \nenhance import and export opportunities for industries and facilitate connectivity and access of \nagricultural producers to Bishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast markets. It will have a positive impact on \nthe construction materials industry. Agricultural producers will have better access to markets of \nBishkek and Issyk-Kul oblast.  \n \n51.  Mitigation. To gain the most benefit from the Project, training on the development of \nroadside businesses should be organized for the local population, and microcredit programs \nlaunched as complementary projects.  \n \n    c.  Tourism \n \n52.  Impact. The improved road and modernized customs facilities and procedures will have a \npositive impact on tourism development. Tourists traveling from/to PRC will have more comfortable \nand faster travel, and local tourist attractions will be more accessible. The local population will \nbenefit from increased activity such as hotel business, horse rental, handicraft trade, and entrance \nfees collected from tourists. Provided that the tourist season lasts only for 3\u20134 months, the potential \nof tourist attractions is still far from being fully exploited; even if increasing number of tourists visit the \narea, it can be concluded that no adverse impacts are anticipated in the foreseeable future.  \n \n53.  Mitigation. In order to maximize benefits of the Project, the rehabilitation of the road corridor \nshould be complemented with projects on facilitation of border-crossing procedures for tourists, and \ndevelopment of ecotourism ventures. Tourist-oriented road signage should be introduced. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 11   \n    d.  Transport Networks \n \n54.  Impact.  Detours  and  traffic  inconveniences  will  occur  during  construction.  Following \nconstruction, the primary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of the \ntransport sector and greatly facilitate the flow of traffic, goods, and travelers.  \n \n55.  Mitigation.  Care  will  be  taken  during  the  construction  period  to  ensure  that  traffic \ndisruptions to road transport are minimized. Traffic management plans should be prepared. \n \n    e.  Health and Road Safety \n \n56.  Impact. Improvement of the road corridor will contribute to a safer journey and a reduction in \nthe number of road accidents, and will facilitate access to advanced oblast and national health \nservices. However, the improved road will increase vehicle operating speeds on the road and, if not \ncontrolled, accidents involving people and livestock may increase.  \n \n57.  Mitigation. In Naryn, Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Kara-Bulung provisions should \nbe made for paved shoulders, road signage and speed limits, and service roads for local traffic.  \n \n    f.  Population and Communities \n \n58.  Impact. No adverse impacts on settlement patterns and communities are anticipated.  \n \n59.  Mitigation. Opportunities for complementary actions to strengthen the community aspects \nof the project area are addressed by the social assessment. In summary, they include training for \npeople (especially women) living along the road on new opportunities opened by improved road \nsuch as roadside trade, tourist accommodation, and microcrediting of roadside businesses. \n \n    g.  Cultural and Historical Heritage \n \n60.  Impact.  No  impacts  to  archaeological  and  historic  resources  are  anticipated,  with  the \nexception of a graveyard (Km 314) located close to the alignment that may be affected by vibration.  \n \n61.  Mitigation. No mitigation related to known cultural resources is warranted. Contract \nprovisions  are  recommended  to  ensure  that  construction  works  are  suspended,  local \nadministration and state organizations on cultural heritage are informed, and all necessary \nmeasures to protect cultural resources are taken in the event of unexpected discoveries. The \nfencing of the graveyard located at Km 314 should be strengthened. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n62.  Legal and Institutional Framework. According to the Law on Environmental Expertise, any \nproject  activities  should  be  preceded  by  preparation  and  submission  of  OVOS  (the  Russian \nacronym for \u201cassessment of environmental impacts\u201d), and its approval by Ecological Expertise \n(State Environmental Review). The OVOS documentation should include endorsements from local \nadministration, sanitary control bodies, Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing \nIndustry and other organizations, depending on environmental attributes affected by the Project. \n \n63.  Institutional Requirements. The Investment Projects Implementation Department (IPID) \nwill be responsible for ensuring that environmental procedures are incorporated in each stage of the \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nwork\u2014such as document tender and contract preparation, bid reviews and awards, and supervision \nof preconstruction baseline monitoring\u2014as an integral part of construction supervision.  \n \n64.  IPID will be responsible for overall contract administration and day-to-day project supervision \nincluding environmental management. An environment and/or social officer will be appointed within \nIPID to be responsible for ensuring the environmental management plan, including monitoring \nrequirements, are implemented effectively. The construction supervision consultant will assist IPID \nin its responsibilities, including instrumental environmental monitoring of the Project.  \n \n65.  Environmental Monitoring Program. The environmental monitoring program includes \nroutine site inspections and reporting related to soil and erosion control; embankment and \nerosion protection; borrow-pit restoration; noise, vibration, air, and water quality monitoring \n(including baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring); and terrestrial and/or river \necosystem health monitoring. Specific monitoring provisions include:  \n(i)  Water  quality.  Instrumented  baseline  and  routine  periodic  water  quality \nmonitoring. It will be complemented with routine monitoring of water quality by \nmacrozoobenthos (once a year for 2 years). \n(ii)  Air quality. Instrumented baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring.  \n(iii)  Noise. Instrumented baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring.  \n(iv)  Ecosystem degradation. Routine roadside ecosystem monitoring by indicator \nbird species. \n(v)  Land use-related impacts. Monitoring of quarry activities, siting of construction \ncamps and related facilities, and siting of asphalt plants.  \n \n66.  Environmental Management Plan. The summary plan is in Table A11.3. \n  \nF.  Public Consultations \n \n67.  A  number  of  public  consultations  with  experts,  local  administrations,  nongovernment \norganizations, and the general public were held in May\u2013June 2008. Informal consultations with the \nlocal population in Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages, and with representatives of \nnongovernment  organizations  were  held  in  Bishkek.  A  stakeholder  workshop  for  local \nadministrations of Naryn and At-Bashi rayons was conducted on 16 June 2008. Also, consultations \nwith experts from the Ministry of Emergencies, Ministry of Transport and Communications, and \nAcademy  of  Sciences  were  held.  The  comments  from  previous  large  stakeholder  workshops \nconducted in Naryn and Bishkek in 2006 were used to assess the actuality of the problem. \n \n68.  A summary of the opinions of the public consultations is as follows: \n(i)  The local population supports the upgrading of the road corridor provided that it \nwill bring more socioeconomic benefits to the local population. \n(ii)  Feeder roads were proposed by locals to be included in the Project, specifically two \nroads connecting rayon center At-Bashi and EM-07, and the main street in Naryn \nthat is a part of the road linking Ak-Talaa rayon and Tash-Bashat village. \n(iii)  Due  to  safety  and  noise  and/or  vibration  issues,  it  was  proposed  that \nconsideration be given to bypasses of Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung villages. \n(iv)  Noise and vibration issues were the major concern in Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and \nKarabulung villages and Naryn town. The recent letter from the people of Ottuk to \nMOTC repeatedly raised these issues.  \n(v)  Local people should be involved in the road construction. \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 11   \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n69.  The findings of the IEE are as follows: \n(i)  Construction activities under the Project will be largely of a rehabilitation nature \nwithin the previously disturbed road corridor and no significant environmental \nimpacts are anticipated. \n(ii)  The Km 355\u2013Km 357 (Kyzyl\u2013Bel Pass) section is a landslide-prone area for which \nat least three alternatives were proposed: existing route, bypass, and viaduct. On \nthe basis of information available, the Design Institute proposes the existing route \nin combination with geotechnical measures as the optimal alternative.  \n(iii)  The study of ecosystems health conducted in the frame of this IEE showed that \nthere are ecosystems in the Project area that are more sensitive to environmental \nimpacts, specifically: mid-mountain flood-plain and meadow ecosystems located in \nthe Karaunkur\u2013Ottuk gorge, and sub-alpine ecosystems (Dolon and Ak Beit passes). \n(iv)  According to the local people from Karaunkur, Ottuk, Kara-Suu, and Karabulung \nvillages living in proximity to the road, noise and vibration have an impact on their \nhouses.  However,  visual  examination  showed  that  the  houses  are  located \noutside the ROW, and the major problem is probably related to overloaded trucks \nand their noncompliance with the 30 km/hr speed limit.  \n(v)  The  examination  of  baseline  water  quality  in  rivers  of  the  project  area  by \nchemical analysis and bioindicators survey undertaken within the frame of the \nIEE showed that water quality is good. \n \n70.  The following recommendations are proposed based on the findings of the IEE: \n(i)  Environmental provisions in contract. Specific environmental provisions are \nrecommended for inclusion in contract documents including provisions related \nbut not limited to: (a) erosion control and air and water quality control; (b) location \nof asphalt plants, construction camps, and other facilities (not in environmentally \nsensitive areas indicated above); (c) borrow-pit restoration; (d) quarry operations; \n(e) safety provisions; (f) baseline and routine monitoring of air quality, water \nquality, noise, and ecosystem health; and (g) community relations. \n(ii)  Environmental monitoring. Baseline noise, vibration and air quality monitoring \nis recommended at the preconstruction stage in settlements along the road. \n(iii)  Capacity  building  for  environmental  management. A training program for \nselected  staff  and  addressed  to  the  goals  and  techniques  of  environmental \nmanagement activities in road projects is recommended. \n(iv)  Recommended complementary projects. A training program to ensure that \nlocal businesses and population will be able to use all the benefits provided by \nbeing  adjacent  to  the  international  road  corridor  is  recommended.  A \ncomplementary  project  to  increase  attractiveness  of  the  Salkyn-Tor  State \nNational Park for ecotourists is recommended.  \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n71.  The  Project  will  have  significant  social  benefits  and,  if  the  prescribed  mitigation  and \nmanagement measures are fully implemented, the Project is unlikely to have major adverse \nenvironmental impacts. An environmental monitoring plan has been prepared and responsibilities \nfor implementation assigned. A budget has been allocated for environmental management and \nmonitoring. A full environmental impact assessment under ADB guidelines is not required. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  59 \nTable A11.3: Summary Environmental Management Plan \nResponsibility \nEnvironmental  Mitigation  Estimated Cost \nIssue  Measures  ($)  Location  Time Frame  Implementation  Supervision \nA.
