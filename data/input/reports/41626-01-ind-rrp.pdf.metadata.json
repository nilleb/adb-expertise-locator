Project  investments  include  installation  of \nnew, and renovation and modernization (R&M) of existing transmission substations; installation \nof  new,  and  reinforcement  of  existing  transmission  lines;  and  the  improving  of  distribution \nsystems in seven towns in Bihar. This will reduce system bottlenecks, boost power supply and \nsystem reliability, and minimize technical and commercial losses. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIndia's  annual  economic  growth  rate  of  over  8%  since  2008  has  accelerated  energy \n3. \nneeds.  Suffering  nationwide  from  peak  power  deficits  of  around  12%,  India  has  identified \ninfrastructure  improvements  and  better  electric  power  supply  as  a  key  feature  of  its  drive  to \nsustain  high  growth  levels.  Currently,  only  about  60%  of  Indian  households  have  access  to \nelectricity. Adequate supply is essential for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n4. \nWhile  India  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  fastest-growing  countries  in  the  world,  Bihar\u2014\nwith  a  population  of  90  million  and  a  per  capita  income  of  around  $160\u2014remains  one  of  its \npoorest states. One in seven of India's poor resides in Bihar, and about 40% of the population \nlives below the poverty line, compared with 23% nationally. Per capita consumption of electricity \nin Bihar  was approximately  100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per  annum  in  FY2007,2 compared  with a \nnational average of over 700 kWh. In FY2008, Bihar faced energy shortages of 28% and peak \npower shortages 16%. However, the true extent of unserved and suppressed demand is difficult \nto gauge as supply has been irregular for so long.  \n \n5. \nBihar's  power  sector  is  in  need  of  investment.  Insufficient  capacity  of  its  transmission \nnetwork  restrains  reliability, quality,  and  stability of  power  supply.  Bihar's  electricity  distribution \nnetwork  has  failed  to  keep  pace  with  growing  demand.  Power  transformer  capacity  is \ninadequate to meet demand on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders in many areas, 33 kV and 11 kV feeders \nare  being loaded  above thermal  limits,  and failure rates for  distribution  transformers  are about \n19%. Undersized conductors, long low-voltage circuits, and overloaded distribution transformers \nfurther impair quality of supply. Overall, system losses exceed 40%. This is a considerable drag \non sector finances and sustainability.  \n \nThough Bihar needs more generation capacity to begin closing the supply\u2013demand gap, \n6. \nboosting  generation  is  a  relatively  low  priority  because  Bihar  is  able  to  buy  power  from  the \ncentral  generation  utilities  and  from  independent  generators.  Upgrading  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems,  and  reducing  system  losses,  is  thus  a  first  and  more  essential  step, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Planning and Development Department, Government of Bihar. 2009. Power Sector Report. Patna. \n\n\f2 \n\nparticularly since adding generation will be more efficient and cost-effective once system losses \nare  contained.  The  proposed  project  will  address  these  concerns  in  four  distribution  circles \n(seven  towns)  within  the  state,3 and  through  two  transmission  system  upgrade  components.4 \nThe capacity development component will deal with constraints in managerial and engineering \npractices that have contributed to the high system losses. \n \n7. \nUpgrading the transmission and distribution (T&D) systems is one of four power sector \npriorities in the Government of India's 11th Five Year Plan.5 This project is thus consistent with \nthe  government's  strategy,  and  the  India  country  partnership  and  strategy  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  which  complements  the  government's  strategy  and  specifies  ADB \nsupport  of  energy  initiatives  in  India,  including  expanding  and  optimizing  T&D  systems, \nproviding institutional strengthening, and encouraging energy efficiency and conservation.6  \n \n8. \nThe  project  also  reflects  lessons  from  previous  ADB  interventions.  The  country \nassistance  program  evaluation,7 conducted  in  2007,  notes  that  ADB's  sector  performance  is \nrated  successful  because  most  ADB  assistance  helped  build  much-needed  infrastructure  and \ncontributed to  the  improvement  of sector  policy and institutional  environments. This  evaluation \nstresses  the  need  to  stay  focused  on  states  that  suffer  from  high  poverty  levels,  low  levels  of \nsocial  development,  weak  capacity  and  poor  infrastructure.  Also  in  2007,  a  sector  assistance \nprogram  evaluation  of  India\u2019s  energy  sector  identified  the  following  main  lessons:  (i)  ADB\u2019s \napproach to lending at the state level has worked well and should be used as a model for future \nassistance;  (ii)  sustained  technical  assistance  has  been  crucial  to  the  success  of  state \nprograms, both before and after loans were made; and (iii) corporatization via the introduction of \ncommercially and financially sustainable principles into state entities, and increasing the quality \nof governments can considerably improve efficiency and deliver better services to customers.8 \n \n9. \nThese experiences are reflected in the design and preparation of the  project, as this is \nADB's first power sector intervention in Bihar\u2014a state with a high level of poverty and significant \nneeds  for  upgraded  electricity  infrastructure.  The  project  is  accompanied  by  TA  aimed  at \ncapacity  development  and \nfinancial  management  and  governance. \nin \nFurthermore, capacity-building efforts in the Bihar power sector have been ongoing for several \nyears to (i) prepare the project, including an existing technical assistance program analyzing the \nstate\u2019s  power  system  and  preparing  a  10-year  investment  plan,  and  providing  training  for  and \ncomputerization  of  system  planning; 9  and  (ii)  to  train  key  executing  agency  staff  on  ADB \nprocurement  and  disbursement  guidelines.  Regarding  improving  sector  policy  and  institutional \nenvironments,  the  Government  of  Bihar  is  in  the  process  of  planning  the  restructuring  and \nunbundling  activities  of  the  Bihar  State  Electricity  Board  (BSEB)  in  accordance  with  the \nElectricity Act, 2003. \n \n\nimprovements \n\n                                                \n3  The remaining 12 distribution circles within Bihar are receiving investment funds through the Government of India's \n\nrural electrification program, Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana.  \n\n4  Central government funds via the Revised Accelerated Power Development and Reports Program will fund similar \n\ninvestments in the state's other 12 distribution circles.  \n\n5  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

The  outcome  will  be  stronger T&D  capacity, greater T&D system efficiency,  and \nhigher  quality  and  reliability  of  service  in  Bihar.  Specifically,  the  investment  components  will \nfocus on seven towns within four of the 16 distribution circles in Bihar.10   \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nOutputs  include  T&D  system  components,  and  a  capacity  development  component. \nTransmission  component  outputs  include  (i)  transmission  expansion  via  one  new  220/132  kV \ngrid  substation  at  Pusauli,  (ii)  two  new  132/33  kV  substations,  at  Dhanha  and  Gangwara, \n(iii) erection  of  additional  132  kV  bays  at  six  existing  substations,  (iv)  erection  of  additional \n220 kV bays at the Dehri substation, (v) erection of new 33 kV bays - 10 each at Gangwara and \nDhanha  (both  at  the  substation  end  and  remote  end),  and  (vi)  approximately  368  kilometers \n(km)  of  new  transmission  lines  (consisting  of  33  kV,  132  kV,  and  220  kV  lines).  Distribution \ncomponent  outputs  include  the  following  to  be  implemented  in  seven  towns  within  Bihar \n(footnote 10): (i) construction of 33/11 kV substations and R&M of existing 33/11 kV substations, \n(ii) construction of 33 kV, 11 kV and low-tension lines, and R&M of existing lines, (iii) installation \nof new distribution transformers  and capacity augmentation and R&M of existing transformers, \nand  (iv)  installation  and/or  replacement  of  consumer  metering  equipment.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  component  is  designed  to  assist  the  executing  agency,  BSEB,  with  project \nimplementation  support  and  construction  supervision  as  this  is  its  first  loan  from  a multilateral \ndevelopment  institution.  This  component  also  includes  training  in  high-voltage  distribution \nsystems  and  will  fund  feasibility  studies  for  a  small  project  to  pilot  high-voltage  distribution \nsystems,  as  well  as  other  training  programs  on  financial  management  and  corporate  and \nmanagerial planning.11  \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe project is estimated to cost $153.9 million. The government has requested a loan of \n$132.2  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be \ncapitalized  in the loan), and such other terms and conditions  as set forth  in  the  draft  loan  and \nproject  agreements. The government  has  provided  ADB  with (i) the  reasons for  its  decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB.

Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be applied. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nADB  has  reviewed  and  confirmed  the  technical  viability.  The  transmission  components \nto  be  financed  by  ADB  are  part  of  BSEB\u2019s  transmission  expansion  plan.  Development  of  the \nplan  tends  to  follow  an  iterative  process  in  which  requirements  for  national  grid  offtake  and \npower  substation  (33/11  kV)  supply  are  matched,  so  as  to  determine  the  least-cost  means  of \ndeveloping the transmission network under a reasonable range of scenarios. In this sense, the \ntransmission  master  plan  is  the  least-cost  means  of  achieving  a  desired  set  of  electricity \ntransmission  outcomes.  Regarding  the  distribution  system,  there  are  no  viable  alternatives  to \nsubstation  and transformer  modernization,  line upgrades,  and  system metering. The  proposed \ninvestment  components  fit  in  with  the  master  plan  developed  for  the  state's  power  sector \n(footnote  9).17 Technical  specifications  and  line  diagrams  for  the  proposed  substations  were \nreviewed,  supply  and  installation  costs  analyzed,  and  technical  loss  reductions  through  some \ninvestments under the project quantified. Project designs will be (i) consistent with overall least-\ncost  expansion  plans;  (ii)  have  a  least-cost  basis;  and  (iii)  reflect  best-practice  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  features.  Investment  components  will  feature \nperformance-based  design  consistent  with  international  benchmarks  for  system  efficiency  and \noperating risk. The  capacity  development  component  will  fund  construction  oversight services. \nFurthermore, the attached TA provides implementation support.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  investments  under  the  loan.  A  time-slice \napproach was adopted for detailed economic cost\u2013benefit analysis, taking into consideration the \nentire T&D system investment program for the state (which includes the investment components \nfunded by the Bihar Power System Improvement Project), as detailed in the Bihar power system \nmaster plan. This was done to avoid the difficulties inherent in allocating costs and benefits to \nindividual components, given the poor condition of most of Bihar\u2019s electricity networks. The main \neconomic benefits of the proposed investments are incremental consumption, and displacement \nof  thermal  electricity  and  self-generation  from  diesel  plants.  Incremental  consumption  was \nvalued  at  consumers\u2019  estimated  willingness  to  pay  for  it.  Displaced  thermal  generation  was \nvalued  at  estimated  long-run,  average  incremental  cost  of  power  supply  to  Bihar,  calculated \nfrom the generation part of the power system master plan. Displaced self-generation was valued \nat the variable cost of an average diesel generator. \n \n21. \nA  \u2015with-project\u2016  and  \u2015without-project\u2016  approach  was  adopted  for  the  purposes  of \nanalysis.  It  was  assumed  that  in  the  without-project  case,  network  outages,  losses,  and \nunserved demand would increase in proportion to forecast demand. In the with-project case, it \nwas  assumed  that  outages,  losses,  and  unserved  demand  would  decrease  over  time  as \nnetwork constraints are relieved.18  \n \nA  period  of  25  years  has  been  used  for  economic  evaluation,  including  8  years  for \n22. \ncapital  investment  and  construction.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place  in  2010\u20132017,  and \n                                                \n17  The TA included analysis of the generation, transmission, and distribution systems in Bihar, including reviewing the \n\nproposed investments for the project.  \n\n18  For conservatism, the loss reduction trajectory assumed for the purposes of analysis was not as steep as that used \nin the power system master plan, with the latter assuming a halving of losses (as a percentage of net generation) \nover 9 years. \n\n\fbenefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  progressively  from  2011.  The  detailed  cost\u2013benefit \ncalculations  show  that  the  overall  power  system  master  plan  investment  program  is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 26.5%.19  \n \nFinancial analysis of components to be funded from the proposed loan was carried out in \n23. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.20 Incremental  costs \nand  benefits  were  computed  based  on  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios  for  each \ncomponent.  The  costs  include  land  acquisition,  civil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operating \nand  maintenance  costs,  and  distribution  cost.  BSEB  has  limited  energy  and  power  metering \nwithin  its  network,  with  no  practical  means  to  isolate  and  measure  the  direct  benefits  of  the \ninvestment  components.  Therefore,  the  annual  revenue  requirement  approach  was  used  to \ndetermine the financial benefits of the project components. This approach reflects the fact that \nBSEB  will  petition  the  Bihar  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  to  have  the  new  investments \nadded to BSEB\u2019s regulatory asset base at the next tariff redetermination, with the result that the \ncapital,  operating,  and  replacement  cost  of  the  new  assets  will  be  included  in  the  annual \nrevenue requirement against which BSEB will be able to charge its customers. This approach to \ntariff setting ensures that BSEB is able to recover costs and earn a sufficient return on its equity, \nand provides an incentive to BSEB to invest in network expansion. \n \n24. \nIncremental  cash flows  attributable to the  proposed  investments  were  estimated  based \non the methodology and assumptions described above. The financial internal rates of return are \nestimated at 4.9% for the transmission component and at 7.6% for the distribution component. \nThese returns compare favorably with the estimated value of weighted average cost of capital of \n2.8%, substantiating the financial viability of the investments.21  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA  governance  assessment  of  the  Bihar  power  sector  was  conducted,  including  public \n\n25. \nfinancial management, procurement activities, and anticorruption measures.  \n \n26. \nRegarding  public  financial  management,  BSEB  budgets  are  prepared  annually,  and \nfinancial targets for all significant activities are detailed enough to provide a meaningful tool for \nmonitoring  subsequent  performance.  Actual  expenditure  is  compared  with  budgeted  targets, \nsignificant  variations  are  reviewed,  and  corrective  actions  are  taken.  No  major  issues  were \nobserved  regarding  BSEB\u2019s  accounting  and  internal  control.  However,  more  computerization \ncould  considerably  simplify  record  keeping.  BSEB  recognizes  that  internal  auditing  plays  an \nimportant role in ensuring good corporate governance and has internal audit functions in place. \nExternal  auditors  have  raised  no  major  accountability  issues  in  their  three  most  recent  annual \nreports.  \n \nThe procurement and payment process will follow a cross-checking principle. Based on \n27. \nproject  requirements,  the  Store  and  Purchase  Department  requests  its  Central  Purchase \nCommittee, which is headed by the BSEB chair, to approve the procurement process of goods \nand spares. The Store and Purchase Department then carries out a competitive bidding process \nfor  the  procurement  of  goods.  After  the  selection  of  the  lowest  bidder,  the  Central  Purchase \nCommittee  compares  the  cost  of  the  goods  with  the  approved  budget  before  approving \nissuance of the purchase order. The Store and Purchase Department then issues the purchase \n                                                \n19  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 2005.

The  Right  to  Information  Act,  2005  allows  citizens  access  to \ninformation  on  affairs  of  the  government  or  the  government  organizations.  Procurement \nprocedures are covered by the act, and citizens can access (within the prescribed time frame) \nany information relating to a procurement decision. \n \n28. \nBSEB  staff  have  participated  in  ADB-sponsored  loan  disbursement  and  procurement \nseminars.  ADB  also  has  provided  support  to  BSEB  in  preparing  bidding  documents  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nincluding  training  and  knowledge  transfer  of  procurement  matters.  Furthermore,  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component  includes  financial  management  training,  computerization,  and  other \nplanning-improvement activities.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n29. \nwith the government and BSEB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.22 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n30. \nAdequate  power  supply  is  essential  to  sustain  economic  growth.  Regular  and  efficient \npower supply is correlated to poverty reduction. Indian states like Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat, \nwith high  levels  of  power generation  and  consumption,  also  have lower poverty  rates.  Bihar  is \none  of  the  poorest  states  in  India,  with  about  40%  of  the  population  classified  as  poor.  Bihar \nalso  has  one  of  the  lowest  electrification  rates  in  India:  only  41%  of  villages  have  electricity \n(versus  an  84%  national  average)  and  only  about  10%  of  households  (versus  a  56%  national \naverage).  The  project  will  cover  seven  districts:  Bhojpur,  Begusarai,  West  Chanparan,  Buxar, \nEast  Chanparan,  Samastipur,  and  Nalanda.  Agriculture  is  the  primary  economic  activity  in  all \nthese areas, and access to reliable electricity supplies is wanting.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  improving  the  power  sector  are  manifold.  Technical  developments  and \n31. \nreforms  that  lead  to  sector  sustainability  can  free  up  resources  for  other  pro-poor  initiatives. \nGreater and more reliable power supply helps bolster social services as hospitals, schools, and \nother  social  entities  often  suffer  most  from  patchy  and  low-quality  power  supply,  and  load \nshedding.  Socially,  efficient  power  supply  increases  access  to  electronic  media  such  as \ntelevision and radio, allowing better informed choices and greater understanding of civic affairs. \nDeveloping  Bihar\u2019s  power  sector  will  boost  farm  mechanization  and  agricultural  yield,  and \nbenefit \nindustrial  sectors  through  business  expansion  and  more \nemployment  opportunities.  Regular  power  supply  will  also  shore  up  household  activities  and \ncottage industries. All these factors help reduce poverty. \n\nthe  commercial  and \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  B.  Major  components  proposed \nunder this project are supply and installation of transmission substations and transmission lines, \nas well as distribution substations and distribution lines. The civil construction work is limited to \nbuilding  foundations  for  the  transmission  towers,  distribution  poles,  and  substations.  Project \nactivities  are  proposed  mainly  in  major  towns  and  will  be  carried  out  mainly  on  government-\nowned land. Some private land will be required for which resettlement plans in line with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  are  developed  and  will  be  implemented.  No  forest  or \nsensitive areas such  as national  parks  or  wildlife  sanctuaries  are  affected by  project  activities. \n\n                                                \n22  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n\fThe  routes  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  lines  will  not  cross  such  areas.  Environmental \nissues  identified  are  typical  for  the  type  of  component  construction,  and  a  range  of  proven \nmitigation  strategies  exist  to  address  them.  There  are  adequate  budgetary  provisions  for \nimplementation  of  the  environment  management  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  is  part  of  the  bidding \ndocuments,  and  the  executing  agency  will  supervise  the  construction  contracts  and  EMP \nimplementation.  Quarterly  progress  reports  of  its  implementation  will  be  submitted  to  ADB.  In \nthe  event  of  any  change  of  alignment  of  the  transmission  lines  or  the  substations,  or \nidentification  of  any  unanticipated  environmental  impacts  during  the  course  of  project \nimplementation,  the  executing  agency  will  revise  the  EMP  accordingly.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations were prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.23  \n \n33. \nThe  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  and  indigenous \npeoples  category  C.  Census  surveys  and  consultations  were  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Safeguards  Policy  Statement.  Construction  of  the  three  transmission  substations  will \nrequire  acquisition  of  4.1  hectares  of  privately  owned  land.24 The  social  census  identified  the \nresettlement  impacts  as  insignificant,25 affecting  nine  households  in  project  vicinity  that  will  be \ncompensated  for  the  loss  of  agricultural  land.26 The  construction  of  transmission  lines  will  not \nrequire  permanent  land  acquisition.  Regarding  gender  issues,  the  loan  agreements  include  a \nstandard  assurance  related  to  core  labor  standards  for  contractors  (including  equal  pay  for \nequal type of work), and an awareness program on HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and \nhuman trafficking.27  \n \n34. \nAs  this  project  will  be  the  first  externally  financed  project  for  BSEB,  the  project \nmanagement unit will need capacity development relating to safeguard compliance, monitoring, \nand management of environmental management and resettlement plans during implementation. \nRequisite  training  of  project  management  unit  staff  is  planned,  as  well  as  implementation \nsupport  designed  to  transfer  knowledge  of  implementation  matters  to  the  executing  agency. \nDetails are included in the project administration manual.28 \n  \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nA broad risk is that capacity constraints within BSEB\u2014including those related to financial \nmanagement,  governance,  and  implementation  matters\u2014could  cause  delays  in  achieving \nproject  outcomes.  These  risks  are  mitigated  by  management  commitment  and  sound \nsupervision  built  into  the  project  design  through  implementation  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Overall, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n\n                                                \n23 Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Distribution  Component;  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Transmission \n\nComponent (Appendix 2). \n\n24 The total land area required for the substations is 10.5 hectares, but 6.4 hectares are government-owned. \n25 ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila. The handbook defines resettlement as \n\u2015insignificant\u2016 when (i) less than 200 people are displaced from housing; and/or (ii) less than 200 people will lose \nfewer than 10% of their productive assets (income-generating).  \n\n26 An additional 39 households are absentee landlords that do not reside in the local area, bringing the total number \n\nof affected households to 48. \n27 Resettlement Plan (Appendix 2). \n28 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nIncrease in prices of raw \nmaterials exceeds contingency \nand inflation forecasts \n\nMitigating Measures \nAdequate contingencies have been provided in the cost estimate and suitable price \nvariation provisions have been included in the bidding documents. Early \nprocurement action has been initiated. \n\nThe project's investment components are routine and commonplace in India, with \nnumerous qualified contractors. \n\nADB's Procurement Guidelines, including use of international competitive bidding, \nensures the participation of qualified contractors. \n\nImplementation support and oversight support are included in the attached \ntechnical assistance and the capacity development loan component. \n\nThe capacity development loan component includes implementation support, and \nwill strengthen internal control systems.
