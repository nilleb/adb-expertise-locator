THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nSecond Upper Secondary Education Sector Development Program. \n \n2.  The program is part of the phased support that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndesigned to develop high-quality human resources by improving the effectiveness of upper \nsecondary education (USE). It builds on and complements ADB\u2019s ongoing Upper Secondary \nEducation Sector Development Program (USESDP 1).1 The Second Upper Secondary Education \nSector Development Program (USESDP 2) will (i) improve teacher quality and boost the quality \nand labor market relevance of USE; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for USE planning, \nmanagement, and delivery. While the policy reforms will apply nationwide, the project activities \nwill cover only selected areas. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s  sequenced  approach  to  reform.  ADB  has  supported  education  and  skills \ndevelopment in Cambodia since 2001 through sector development programs, investment loans, \ntechnical assistance grants, policy and advisory support, and knowledge products (figure).2 \nADB\u2019s USE engagement builds upon critical lessons from its extensive engagement in the \neducation sector. This highlights the importance of strategically sequencing medium- to long-term \nsupport to build the foundation for the reforms, allow these to take root, and show results. \n \nADB\u2019s Engagement in Cambodia\u2019s Education Sector \n \n2018\u20132023  \n2016\u20132021   Proposed \nUpper  Second Upper \nSecondary  Secondary \n2012\u20132018 \n2008\u20132014  ESDP  ESDP \nThird ESDP \nEnhancing \n2001\u20132005  Education \nESDP  Quality  2019\u20132024 \nProject  Proposed Skills for \n2015\u20132020 \nTVET Sector  Competitiveness \nDevelopment  Project \n2008\u20132015 \nProgram \nStrengthening \n2004\u20132008  TVET Project    Support for MOEYS \nSecond ESDP  Support for MOEYS and MLVT \n \n  Support for MLVT    \n \nESDP = Education Sector Development Program; MLVT = Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training; MOEYS = Ministry \nof Education, Youth and Sport; TVET = technical and vocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n4.  Transition from first to second phase of support. This second program builds on the \nfirst phase of targeted ADB assistance to USE. The first program supports government efforts to \n                                                \n1  ADB. Cambodia: Upper Secondary Education Sector Development Program. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \novercome key constraints to increasing access to USE through policy reforms and investment \nactivities. USESDP 1 financially supports poor USE students through scholarships; provides \nhardship allowance and teacher housing for USE teachers in remote and disadvantaged areas; \nand constructs upper secondary schools (USSs) in seven disadvantaged provinces, of which five \nhave a significant indigenous peoples\u2019 population. USESDP 1 also introduced reforms to improve \nUSE quality, including developing a curriculum framework; strengthening science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; and issuing a comprehensive teacher policy. \nFollowing these policy reforms and the progress of USESDP 1, this second phase focuses on \nremoving the remaining constraints and deepening quality, relevance, and management capacity \nreforms. USESDP 2 therefore adopts a holistic approach, establishing required inputs, policies, \nand systems (i.e., well-equipped schools, highly qualified teachers, curriculum and assessment \nreforms, and strong school leadership and support) before nationwide expansion to allow for \nstronger and measurable learning outcomes in the future. The overall program aligns with the \nsecond strategic pillar of the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia.3 \n \n5.  The development problem. Cambodia\u2019s economic growth in 2017 remained strong, \nestimated at 7.0% and fueled by increases in foreign direct investment and export diversification.4 \nHowever,  sustaining  high  growth  requires  economic  diversification  and  higher  value-added \nproduction. New industries require a skilled workforce for a modern and industrialized economy. \nEconomic integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations adds a sense of urgency to \nintensify industry-linked skills development for a nationally and regionally competitive workforce. \nUSE plays a crucial role in equipping youth with the skills, competencies, and knowledge to benefit \nfrom and contribute to Cambodia\u2019s socioeconomic development. Persistent performance gaps in \nUSE, however, constrain the education sector and the economy\u2019s medium-term growth. \n \n6.  Cambodia\u2019s upper secondary education system. USE in Cambodia comprises the last \n3 years of general secondary education (grades 10\u201312) and includes both academic and technical \ntracks. In school year 2016\u20132017, only one of four upper secondary-aged youths were enrolled \nin USE.5 The 21% national completion rate was worse in rural areas, where the completion rate \nwas at a very low 15%.6 The 18% national dropout rate was higher in ethnic minority communities \nas well, and boys dropped out at a rate almost 3 percentage points higher than the girls\u2019 17% \ndropout rate.7 The grade 12 passing rate was only 62%.8 Education and economic opportunities \nfor the rural poor and those in remote areas, where indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are \npredominant, remain constrained. Given low enrollment and completion rates among ethnic \nminority USE students, the requirement to complete grade 12 for the new bachelor\u2019s degree \nteacher qualification is an additional barrier. A challenge for the secondary education system is \nto produce skilled graduates in science who can also critically analyze, and problem solve. \n \n7.  Binding constraints. The government has identified the following binding constraints: (i) \nlow access to USE; (ii) limited USE quality and labor market relevance; and (iii) weak capacity to \nplan, manage, and deliver USE. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2014.

Phnom Penh. \n \n ", "3 \n8.  Low access to upper secondary education. The high opportunity cost of schooling for \npoor students remains a major constraint to USE enrollment and completion. Corrective measures \nare already underway. Since 2016, the government has been addressing access issues through \npolicy reforms and budget commitments. USESDP 1 has provided complementary support \nthrough key policy reforms and a 5-year investment project that runs until 2021.9 \n \n9.  Lack of qualified teachers. A shortage in qualified teachers\u2014including specialized USE \nsubject teachers\u2014impedes improvements in USE outcomes. Despite notable preservice teacher \ntraining improvements, gaps persist in USE teachers\u2019 content mastery and knowledge of effective \npedagogy to improve student learning. The teaching profession attracts few top graduates, which \npartly explains the lack of qualified teachers and particularly disadvantages USSs. Teachers and \nteacher educators have limited opportunities to upgrade their pedagogical content knowledge. \nTeacher deployment is a challenge and has resulted in few qualified teachers, especially women, \nin disadvantaged areas. The proportion of women teachers in USE remains low at 39% overall, \nwith 43% in urban areas, 37% in rural areas, and 31% in secondary resource schools.10 Even \nfewer  women  teach  physics,  mathematics,  and  information  and  communication  technology \n(ICT).11 Few trained ethnic minority teachers are deployed to their home communities. USESDP \n1 supported a comprehensive teacher policy that directed reforms in teacher recruitment, training, \nand development. However, key reforms on continuous professional development and a well-\ndefined teacher career pathway system that links professional development and experience to \npromotion have yet to be developed and implemented. \n \n10.  Low quality and relevance of standards, curriculum, and assessment. Teaching and \nlearning specialized USE subjects require minimum service standards for basic inputs such as \nlaboratories, workshops, and equipment. Lacking these standards exacerbates inequities in \nteaching and learning quality across Cambodia\u2019s USSs. Limited innovative teaching strategies, \npoor organization of resources, and infrequent review and alignment of curriculum content to the \nskills needs of students and the labor market hamper the full implementation of the revised \ncurriculum supported under USESDP 1. The absence of a learner assessment framework to \nmeasure student learning, identify least learned skills, and analyze underlying factors affecting \npoor learning outcomes precludes improvements in content and pedagogy. The USE system has \nno strong links to private sector partners that could improve labor market relevance. Additionally, \nUSE students have limited access to opportunities for experiential learning, career guidance, and \nadditional learning resources. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) recognizes \nthe need to use ICT in teaching and learning, but the government has yet to prepare a clear \nimplementation plan to inform related investment and training. \n \n11.  Weak capacity to plan, manage, and deliver services. USS directors have weak \ncapacity to provide instructional support to teachers and regularly assess and give feedback on \ntheir performance, impeding student learning and achievement potential. USS directors\u2019 limited \nengagement  with  stakeholders  hampers  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  school \nimprovement plans, and limited monitoring of plan implementation precludes the efficient use and \nallocation of resources. Inadequate USE budgets lead to a lack of critical resources for upgrading \nstudents\u2019 proficiency in specialized USE subjects. Schools generally have limited capacity to \n                                                \n9  USESDP 1 includes construction of additional upper secondary schools in seven disadvantaged provinces. \n10 Secondary resource schools are secondary schools that have a secondary resource center equipped with science \nlaboratories, computer laboratories, a library, meeting rooms, and other facilities. ADB\u2019s previous education programs \nestablished 36 secondary resource schools. \n11 MoEYS Education Management Information System data for school year 2016\u20132017 for grades 10\u201312 is included \nin the Social and Poverty Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4 \neffectively mainstream gender in education as well. A clear human resource development plan \nthat improves secondary school teachers\u2019 qualifications can improve resource allocation and \nmanagement accountability. \n \n12.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB has directly supported developing Cambodia\u2019s \nUSE program and its reforms. Through technical assistance to the MoEYS, ADB helped identify \npolicy and operational gaps and formulated policies to improve USE quality and relevance.12 \nThese  policies  covered  ICT  in  education,  teachers\u2019  professional  development  and  career \npathways,  and  minimum  service  standards  for  quality  assurance.  ADB  has  also  provided \nanalytical and advisory inputs on key policy reforms, including curriculum and assessment, \nschool-based  management,  expansion  of  high-quality  secondary  schools,  and  resource \nallocation. These were achieved through ADB\u2019s extensive engagement in its ongoing education \nprograms (footnote 2) and policy dialogue on medium-term directions and strategies with the \ngovernment through the Education Sector Working Group. \n \n13.  Sector  development  program.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  first  three  education  sector \ndevelopment programs in Cambodia highlight the effectiveness of combining a policy-based \nprogram with an investment component for a comprehensive and integrated response to sector \nissues, gaps, and priorities.13 The policy component will set the national policy framework to \nunderpin the implementation of key reforms to improve teacher quality, expand high-quality \nsecondary schools, and improve sector management. The investment component will support \nconcrete interventions to implement these policy reforms, many of which entail substantial \nfinancial costs. The government was extensively engaged in identifying policy reforms and \ninvestments for USESDP 2. It is also committed to include expenditure related to the reforms in \nfuture budgets to sustain the impact of the reforms beyond the program\u2019s completion. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  high-quality  human  resources \ndeveloped.14 The program will have the following outcome: effectiveness of the USE system \nimproved.15 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Quality of teachers in upper secondary schools improved. This policy-\nbased loan output operationalized the Teacher Policy Action Plan to improve the competency and \nupgrade the status of teachers. The government approved the establishment of teacher education \ncolleges in Phnom Penh and Battambang province, to increase access to quality teacher training. \nThe MoEYS strengthened the continuous professional development of teachers to improve \ncontent knowledge  and  teaching methodologies. The  MoEYS  approved  the  Framework  on \nTeacher Career Pathways to incentivize qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and link \nteachers\u2019 career progression to professional development to retain quality teachers. Underpinned \nby the Cambodian Qualifications Framework,16 the MoEYS approved the recognition of teachers\u2019 \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2016.

The project will help transform Cambodia\u2019s National Institute of Education (NIE) into a \nstate-of-the-art center for training current and future USE teachers. The project will assess the \nNIE\u2019s organization structure, governance, leadership, human resources staffing, and fiduciary \ncapacity. It will upgrade classrooms and science laboratories and will build a new library to \nprofessional standards. The library will have new equipment, teaching and learning resources, \nand separate water and sanitation facilities for women and men. The project will revise preservice \nand in-service curriculum, instruction, and assessment for USE teachers, school directors, and \ninspectors. It will conduct in-service training for STEM and USE teachers from 50 secondary \nresource schools and 81 upper secondary network schools.17 This training will cover the revised \ncurriculum, content knowledge, instruction, and assessment; and will include culturally inclusive \nand gender-responsive STEM teaching and learning methods. The program will provide equal \nopportunity scholarships for NIE lecturers for advanced education programs. NIE librarians will \nreceive training on creating an effective print and e-library environment for students and teachers \nto support learning. The project will also establish a sex-disaggregated teachers\u2019 professional \ndevelopment database to improve planning. \n \n17.  Output  2:  Quality  and  labor  market  relevance  of  upper  secondary  education \nimproved. This output of the policy-based loan established implementation arrangements, review \nand monitoring structures, and standards to review and improve USE outcomes. The MoEYS \nimplemented  the  Curriculum  Framework  for  General  and  Technical  Education.  MoEYS \nestablished a kindergarten to grade 12 student learning assessment framework to guide the \nmeasurement  of  learning  and  inform  improvements  to  the  teaching  and  learning  process. \nMinimum service standards were set for school infrastructure, personnel, and teaching and \nlearning resources for secondary resource schools. These standards define key indicators on \nmajor  inputs  and  processes  to  improve  education  performance  and  inform  expansion  and \nresource allocation. Teaching and learning processes have integrated digital education strategies \nthrough the Policy and Strategies on Information and Communication Technology in Education in \nCambodia, which also guides resource allocation for infrastructure, technical support to schools \nand teachers, and teacher training. \n \n18.  The project will expand high-quality USSs by (i) upgrading ICT and science classrooms in \n36 secondary resource schools; (ii) converting two classrooms in each of these schools into \nscience classrooms; and two classrooms in 81 upper secondary network schools into science \nclassrooms and libraries with equipment, teaching materials, books, and furnishings; (iii) installing \nproject-based, life skills classrooms for activity-based learning in 25 secondary resource schools \nand upgrading 50 school libraries through professional development for librarians; (iv) upgrading \nwater and sanitation facilities in 18 secondary resource schools, including providing separate \ntoilets for girls and boys; and (v) supplying solar power in selected USSs. The project will establish \ngender-responsive and culturally inclusive career guidance programs in 50 secondary resource \nschools, seven in provinces with a significant indigenous peoples\u2019 population. The program will \nestablish  partnerships  between  schools,  local  businesses,  and  industry  to  help  students \nunderstand  working  environments,  and  further  their  studies.  This  includes  site  visits,  work \nexperience programs, career counseling, and guest speakers in secondary resource school \nnetworks. The project will pilot test an extracurricular STEM skills program for upper secondary \nstudents, which will be delivered by external service providers, in 20 secondary resource schools. \n \n                                                \n17 Network schools refer to a cluster of secondary schools that are close to a secondary resource school. \n ", "6 \n19.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation strengthened. This policy-based loan output improved education efficiency and \neffectiveness through improved management, planning, and resource allocation. The MoEYS \napproved school director standards to guide hiring, training, capacity building, and performance \nevaluation of school directors. The MoEYS approved a 10-year human resource development \nplan for secondary education, focusing on improving the qualifications of secondary school \nteachers. It also operationalized the 3-year budget strategic plan that aligns with education \nreforms in the Education Strategic Plan (footnote 12). The MoEYS implemented the Gender \nMainstreaming Strategic Plan in Education, 2016\u20132020 and integrated budget and staff resources \nwith its departments\u2019 budget and staff allocation.18 \n \n20.  The project will provide in-service training on school-based management and the new \ncurriculum  framework  to  some  secondary  resource  school  directors,  deputy  directors,  and \nadministration  and  finance  staff.  In-service  training  on  school-based  finance  will  reach \nadministrators and finance staff from 81 upper secondary network schools, 7 of which are in \nprovinces with a substantial indigenous peoples\u2019 population. The project will provide training to \nstaff from 25 provincial offices of education on the new regional inspection system and 24 \npersonnel from the General Secondary Education Department on secondary resource school \nsupervision and mentoring. The project will improve the grade 12 examination design, delivery, \nprocessing, and analysis procedures through needs assessment and professional development \nprograms  for  Department  of  Examination  Affairs  staff.  It  will  improve  teacher  deployment, \nespecially in rural and indigenous people and/or ethnic minority areas, with increased attention to \ngender gaps. It will also develop multimedia resources for pre- and in-service training and \ndisseminate USE success stories to encourage youth of all backgrounds to participate in USE. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  Overall program financing. The overall program is estimated to cost $53.5 million (Table \n1). ADB will provide a policy-based loan of $15.0 million and a project loan of $35.0 million \nequivalent.

To synergize between the two programs, USESDP 1\u2019s project steering committee, chaired \nby the MoEYS minister, will provide overall supervision and guidance to USESDP 2. USESDP 1\u2019s \nproject director and manager will also lead and manage USESDP 2. The executing agency\u2019s \norganizational  and  operational  structures  are  used  to  implement  and  coordinate  project \nimplementation, i.e., the NIE, the Directorate General of Education, and the Directorate General \nof Administration and Finance are the key implementing agencies and responsible for their \nrespective components. The component-based approach of USESDP 2 promotes more direct \noversight and implementation by MoEYS personnel, which will contribute to stronger project \nunderstanding, competency development, and sustainability beyond the life of the project. The \nproject coordination unit (PCU) and project implementation consultant for USESDP 2 will provide \noversight, coordination, and corporate support to the implementing agencies. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nAspects  Policy-Based Loan  Project Loan \nImplementation period  October 2016\u2013December 2018  December 2018\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2019  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee \nChair: Minister of education \nMembers: (i) secretary of state and undersecretary of state; (ii) representatives \nfrom the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Labor and Vocational \nTraining, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and Ministry of Civil Service; and (iii) \nMoEYS\u2019 Directorate General of Education, Directorate General of Policy and \nPlanning, Directorate General of Administration and Finance, Inspectorate \nGeneral, National Institute of Education, and technical departments \nPSC will provide overall direction and guidance, facilitate inter-ministry \ncoordination, and ensure timely implementation of policy and institutional reforms. \nPSC will meet twice a year. \n(ii)  Executing agency  The MoEYS will undertake the project under established guidelines and \nprocedures and will assign individuals and teams from within its existing structure \nto be responsible for project implementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  program  include  USE  graduates\u2019  improved \nproductivity and cost savings from the secondary schools\u2019 increased system efficiency. The \nprogram will (i) increase the number of USS graduates; (ii) improve the skills and competencies \n ", "9 \nof USE graduates in the labor market, leading to increased earnings; and (iii) reduce the unit cost \nof schooling per student with the increased USE participation, retention, and promotion rates. \nOverall, the program is expected to generate net benefits with a present value of $66 million. \nBenefits of $506 million will accrue through improved incomes of graduates and the increased \nefficiencies of USE administration. Economic costs total $440 million and consist primarily of \ndirect budget expenditures and opportunity costs. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis 14.4%, well above the 9.0% economic opportunity cost of investment. 20 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s financial management assessment of the MoEYS concluded that the overall pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is substantial. Internal controls are weak because capacity \ndevelopment activities are often paid in cash. The MoEYS also has limited capacity to conduct \ninternal audit of the project\u2019s internal controls. To mitigate against weak internal controls, the \nproject financial management manual will include procedures and mechanisms that reduce the \nuse of cash. The project will hire a national finance specialist to train the MoEYS Internal Audit \nDepartment staff on internal audit. Five trained staff will conduct the project\u2019s internal audit. ADB\u2019s \nprocurement capacity and risk assessments showed that the MoEYS procurement unit can \nhandle the procurement of works, goods, and services for the project with the additional, full-time \nsupport of a national procurement specialist. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MoEYS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The program aims to improve the quality of public USSs, which most poor youths attend. \nHigh-quality education programs improve the youth\u2019s economic potential and the country\u2019s future \ncompetitiveness. ADB assessed the program\u2019s poverty impact based on incremental benefits and \ncosts generated  by  program  reforms. Incremental  benefits  result from the  improved future \nincome-generating capacity of USE graduates and the improved efficiency in the delivery of \neducational services in secondary schools. The calculated poverty impact ratio is 0.23, implying \nthat about 23% of net economic benefits accrue to the poor.21 \n \n29.  The program is classified gender equity as a theme. The policy matrix reflects the \ngovernment\u2019s adoption and implementation of the Gender Mainstreaming Strategic Plan in \nEducation, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 18). For the project, the MoEYS developed a gender action plan \n(GAP) based on gender analysis and building on USESDP 1\u2019s GAP.22 It will support (i) gender \nmainstreaming in teaching and learning (gender-responsive pedagogy and materials free of \ngender bias); (ii) a gender-responsive school environment; and (iii) professional development \ntargeted to female staff. The GAP will ensure female students equally benefit from STEM-related \nactivities. The PCU will be responsible for its implementation, monitoring, and at least semiannual \nreporting to ADB. The MoEYS gender working group will also support regular monitoring. \n \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n31.  Environment (category C). The proposed upgrade and renovation of facilities within the \nNIE, secondary resource schools, and selected upper secondary network schools is anticipated \nto have minimal impacts. The upgrade and renovation of classrooms and libraries and the repair \nof degraded water pipes in toilets will be limited to the confines of the existing school compounds. \nThe environmental impacts of construction and renovation works are expected to be temporary \nand localized and can be mitigated by good construction practices. The MoEYS developed an \nenvironmental code of conduct (a simplified environmental management plan) to address the \nidentified health and safety, temporary nuisance, and waste management impacts that it will \ninclude in all civil works contracts. The MoEYS\u2019s quality control guidelines for works in schools \nhave detailed specifications for managing the environment, safety, security, and labor during \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  school  construction  activities.  The  MoEYS\u2019s \nDepartment of Construction has experience in implementing numerous foreign-assisted projects \nand will be supported by project implementation consultants. A grievance redress mechanism will \naddress project-related complaints. None of the policy actions have environmental impacts. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). ADB\u2019s due diligence confirms there will be no \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts, as all works will be located within the boundaries of \nexisting facilities on fenced state-owned land and will not restrict access to lands or people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  The  18  in-depth  interviews  in  13  sample  facilities  confirmed  the  project  can \naccommodate the upgrade of facilities within school sites. The PCU will carry out consultations \nthroughout the project. It will establish a gender-inclusive, project-specific grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and resolve communities\u2019 concerns on project-related impacts, \nwith attention to vulnerable people. The policy actions will not have any impact on involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n33.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Educational  outcomes  for  the  five  northeastern \nprovinces that will be covered by the program, specifically in indigenous people and/or ethnic \nminority communities, are below the national average. Students in these areas face obstacles in \ngaining access to quality and relevant education, such as teacher shortages, high levels of \nteacher absenteeism, and insufficient relevant teacher training on a culturally inclusive curriculum. \nAlthough the project will be implemented countrywide, the features that were integrated in the \noutputs in lieu of an indigenous peoples plan will provide enhanced benefits to indigenous people \nand/or ethnic minority communities and learners. Design features include culturally relevant \ntraining, equal access to enhanced ICT and science classrooms, culturally inclusive career \nguidance, and improved school management in disadvantaged provinces. The policy actions will \nnot have a negative impact on indigenous peoples. The program is expected to have a positive \nimpact on indigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n                                                \n23 ADB.
