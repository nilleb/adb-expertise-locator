The program contributes to Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) by addressing  remaining poverty and reducing inequalities,  accelerating progress in \ngender equality,  promoting rural development and food security, strengthening  governance and \ninstitutional  capacity,2 and enhancing  climate resilience  through  financial  inclusion  (table).3 The \nprogram is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132023  for the Philippines,  in \nwhich financial  inclusion  is  included  under  the  third  strategic  pillar  on  investing  in  people.  The \nprogram  is  also  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u20132022  for  the \nPhilippines.4  While  the reforms were underway well before the  onset  of the  current coronavirus \ndisease  (COVID-19) pandemic,  the  measures  under  subprogram  3  will  facilitate  the  economic \nrecovery process in the Philippines. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe programmatic approach and budget support. The program uses a programmatic \napproach that aligns  ADB assistance with key government reform programs over the medium-to-\nlong term, to support increased access to financial products and services as part  of an inclusive \neconomic growth agenda. In October 2018, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the programmatic \napproach and  a $300  million loan  for subprogram  1.5 Through  14 policy actions,  subprogram 1 \nhelped  the  government prepare  to increase  the  safe use of financial services and scale-up  the \ndelivery  of  financial  services,  especially  through  digital  channels.  Through  15  policy  actions, \nsubprogram  2  builds  on  the  policy  reforms  under  subprogram  1  by  implementing  a  national \nidentity system, continuing to test new initiatives in agriculture finance including insurance, further \nstrengthening \nfinancial  consumer  protection  and  literacy,  expanding  digital  finance,  and \nsupporting  further innovation and capacity development among financial service providers. \n \n4. \nThe program was originally designed to have two subprograms. Considering the ambitious \ntargets set by the government to considerably increase financial inclusion  by 2023, the complex \nnature of the remaining and upcoming reforms, and the need to sustain  progress of such reforms, \nthe government has requested  further support from ADB through subprogram 3, for an indicative \n\n \n\n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2018.

Manila. \n\n\famount of $300 million. While supporting  COVID-19 recovery efforts, subprogram 3 will continue \nsupport for the government's ongoing inclusive finance agenda by leveraging the national identity \nsystem to expand financial inclusion,  building  on the growing digital  payment ecosystem, further \nincreasing  the  capacity  of financial  service  providers  through  their  digital  transformation,  and \nsupporting  reforms to reduce inequalities  in women\u2019s access to finance and to promote women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment.  \n \n5. \nThe development  problem.  The Philippine  economy grew  at an  average rate  of 6.3% \nper year during  2010\u20132019,  up from 4.5% during 2000\u20132009  and  3.0% in the 1990s.6 A total  of \n1.4  million  jobs  for  wage-earners  and  salaried  employees  were  added  in  2019,  reducing  the \nunemployment rate from 5.3% in 2018 to 5.1% in 2019. Important policy reforms\u2014including the \npassage  of the  2019  Universal  Health Care  Law and  social  protection reforms\u2014aim to reduce \ninequalities  in household  income. However, the impact of the COVID-19 could erase these gains. \nGross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  expected  to  contract  by  3.8%  in  2020,  accompanied  by \nincreased  unemployment.7 In  Luzon  alone,  job  losses  are  expected to  reach  4.3 million  in  the \nsecond quarter of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has also amplified poverty as  a development \nchallenge. While the poverty rate fell from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.7% in 2018, given the significant \njob and income losses resulting from the pandemic, ADB estimates suggest that an additional 5.5 \nmillion Filipinos  will fall into poverty, with poverty incidence rising to 20.7% in 2020.8 \n \n6. \nFinancial  inclusion  remains  low  by  regional  comparison,  but  with  some  gains. \nAccording to the Global Findex Survey 2017 (the most recent available), the Philippines  had one \nof the lowest rankings in Southeast  Asia for almost all financial inclusion  indicators. Only 34% of \nFilipino  adults  have an  account at a formal financial institution,  compared with 49%  of adults  in \nIndonesia,  82%  in  Thailand,  and  85%  in  Malaysia.  From  2014  to  2017  the  proportion  of  the \npopulation  that  borrowed  from  a  formal  financial  institution  fell  from  12%  to  10%,  and  the \nproportion  that  saved at a  formal financial institution  declined from 15% to  12%. Lower-income \nhouseholds  were disproportionally  excluded\u2014in 2017 only 18% of the poorest 40% (by income) \nhad an account.9 To address these low figures, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  (BSP), with ADB \nsupport under subprogram 1 and subprogram 2, has  taken steps  to make it easier  to open new \naccounts, strengthened  the focus on digital  financial inclusion,  and pushed  for digital  payments. \nAs a result, financial inclusion as captured under several key metrics has improved. According to \nthe  BSP's  quarterly  financial  inclusion  dashboard  as  of  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019,  since  the \nissuance  of the policy allowing  basic  deposit  accounts (BDA) in 2018,  119  banks  have offered \nBDAs to 4 million  depositors  amounting to \u20b13.5 billion  ($70 million equivalent).10 The number of \ne-money wallets has grown exponentially, from 5 million in 2018 to 8.8 million in 2019 representing \n74%  year-on-year  growth.  Further,  the  number  of  cities  and  municipalities  without  a  banking \npresence declined from 35.6% as of the end of December 2016 to 31.8% in 2019.  \n \n7. \nOther important indicators of financial inclusion have stagnated or declined. Year-\non-year growth of loans to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) declined by 12% \nduring 2018\u20132019, primarily because of a tightening of credit standards.  While the gender gap in \nfinancial inclusion  in  the  Philippines  continues  to  favor women\u201439% of women hold  accounts \ncompared  to  30%  of  men,  and  61%  of  women  save  through  formal  and  informal  channels \n\n \n\n6  ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fcompared  to  57%  of  men\u2014the  lack  of  sex-disaggregated  data  in  other  areas,  including \nentrepreneurship,  makes other gender gaps less visible. More nuanced data is required, notably \nin terms of digital financial literacy and access to credit. Over the medium term, actions to mitigate \nclimate  change,  which  is  among  the  greatest  threats  to  sustainable  development,  poverty \nreduction,  and  financial  stability  including  financial  inclusion,  will  be  critically  important. 11 \nExpanding financial services across the country, especially  in regions  with the highest  levels of \npoverty and  areas  that are  particularly vulnerable  to climate change, is  crucial to  achieving the \ngovernment\u2019s agenda of promoting inclusive growth.12 \n \n8. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic adds to the complexity of addressing barriers to financial \ninclusion. The widespread loss of income and rapid increase in poverty resulting from COVID-19 \nin  the midst  of various  community quarantine  measures  call for even greater  efforts to  achieve \nfinancial  inclusion.  Focusing  on  the  poorest  40%  of  the  population  is  particularly  urgent. \nCOVID-19  emergency  subsidies  exposed  challenges  in  ensuring  timely  provision  of  social \nassistance  and  financial  inclusion,  as  many of  the  non-Pantawid  Pamilyang Pilipino  Program \n(4Ps) families were not identifiable from national databases, and most lacked deposit accounts to \nfacilitate expedient  and  efficient transfers.13 Timely implementation of the  national  identification \nsystem with linkages to the finance sector is needed  to improve access to social services by the \npoor. \n \nBinding constraints. The government has recognized the challenges  and has identified \n9. \nthree  primary constraints  to financial  inclusion:  (i)  structural  impediments which limit  access to \nfinance, especially for the rural poor; (ii) fragmented financial infrastructure which does not provide \nan enabling  environment; and (iii) limited capacity of financial institutions  to expand outreach and \nincrease access to finance.14 \n \n10. \nStructural impediments that limit access to finance. While the Philippine  Identification \nSystem (PhilSys) has  been  approved,  implementation  has  required  a  long  lead  time to ensure \nthat  the system is  robust,  secure, and  inter-operable.  Further,  PhilSys\u2019s linkages  to  the finance \nsector,  credit  reporting  system,  and  overall  payment  infrastructure  have  yet  to  be  formally \nestablished.  In  addition,  agriculture  finance  remains  underdeveloped  and  underutilized,  with \nclimate  change-related  risks  exacerbating  these  weaknesses.  To  better  understand  these \nweaknesses, the BSP introduced a program for rural and thrift banks to increase agriculture value \nchain finance (AVCF) and  pilot test new approaches.15 While crop insurance is available  from a \nsole government provider, it fails to meet the risk protection needs of the estimated 10.26 million \nfarmers  and  producers. 16  Finally,  additional  targeted  financial  literacy  activities  need  to  be \ndesigned  for poor households  and MSMEs, particularly those led by women. \n \n11. \nFragmented financial infrastructure.

Speeches. BSP Governor B. E. Diokono. Sustainable Finance Towards a Climate-Resilient Philippine \n\nEconomy. 21 November. \n\n16 The Philippines Crop Insurance Corporation, an agency attached to  the Department of Agriculture, is mandated by \n\nlaw to provide insurance protection to the country\u2019s agricultural producers, particularly subsistence farmers. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\flimited \n\npayments,  support  the  financial  inclusion  of small  businesses  and  poor  individuals.  However, \nachieving higher levels of financial intermediation also depends on the ability of lenders to assess \ncredit risks and to compensate with collateral if necessary. Collateral registries enable businesses \nto  access  credit  more  affordably  and  allow  financial  institutions  to  reduce  their  lending  risk. \nLegislation  was  passed  in  2008  to  establish  a  comprehensive  credit  reporting  registry,  but \nawareness of the system is limited, which reduces participation among financial service providers. \nFurther implementation of the 2008 law will also help address  the lack of credit data and support \nbank lending, especially to MSMEs. These processes will also support women\u2019s access to credit \nby overcoming barriers  associated with the gender gaps  in asset and land ownership.  Likewise, \nstrengthening  the  government\u2019s  credit guarantee  system  will  help  to  better  meet the  needs  of \nMSMEs, particularly those engaged in agriculture. \n \nLimited capacity  of financial  institutions. Traditional  financial service providers have \n12. \nlimited capacity to reach the underbanked  and those excluded from financial services, including \nwomen. Rural banks, which are best placed to reach MSMEs and agricultural enterprises  in rural \nareas,  have \nfinancial  and  operational  capacity.  Microfinance  nongovernmental \norganizations  (MNGOs) reach the  largest  numbers of microenterprises  and  low-income clients \nbut given the  current regulatory structure\u2014where MNGOs are monitored and  accredited based \non  financial,  social,  and  governance  performance  standards\u2014only  30  MNGOs  have  been \naccredited. While recent reforms encourage financial institutions  to develop their capacity through \ndigital transformation, reducing operating costs and reaching clients more effectively with a wider \nrange of products and services, most financial institutions  lack the resources or ability to innovate. \nInnovation  that  employs  women-friendly  financial  products  and  services  and  enables  more \nwomen to access finance remains limited. Finally, following the adoption of a legal and regulatory \nframework for Islamic  finance,  financial  institutions  need  support  to  develop  client-responsive \nIslamic  Financial  Services  that  can  support  inclusion  for  a  large  segment  of  the  population, \nparticularly in conflict-affected regions of the country such as Mindanao. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  National  Strategy for  Financial \nInclusion  (NSFI)  coordinates  broad-based  initiatives  for  greater  financial  inclusion.  Its  key \nelements include  digital  finance, financial literacy, credit information systems, development of a \nmovable  collateral  registry,  diversification  of  financial  products  and  services,  and  capacity \nstrengthening  of MNGOs. The  government institutionalized  the NSFI by establishing  a steering \ncommittee, requiring  line agencies to develop medium-term work plans to achieve NSFI targets, \nand developing a monitoring and evaluation framework. The committee comprises 13 government \nagencies,  private  sector  institutions,  and  development  partners.  The  BSP  serves  as  the \nsecretariat  responsible  for monitoring  and  coordinating  NSFI implementation.  The  committee\u2019s \nmost recent priority areas of focus have included  agriculture finance and digital  payments. As a \nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has announced 12 areas for structural reforms \nduring 2021\u20132023,  including financial inclusion.  The government aims to ensure that every head \nof household  from the poorest  sector has at least one bank account. To help achieve this target, \nthe government will prioritize accelerating PhilSys registration  of 5 million low-income household \nheads by December 2020. \n \n14. \nProgrammatic approach. The program consists  of three  reform areas  that  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  financial  inclusion.  It  contains  high-impact  policy  actions  to \nsupport the implementation of the NSFI to (i) strengthen  the institutional  and policy environment \nfor financial inclusion, (ii) strengthen the infrastructure for financial inclusion, and (iii) increase the \ncapacity of service providers with a focus on rural banks and nonbank financial institutions.  The \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fgovernment completed 15 policy reforms comprising 8 prior actions and 7 policy milestones. The \nprogram supports  several  Sustainable  Development Goals  and  is  aligned  with key operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (footnote 2), as shown in the table. Four policy actions exceeded \nexpectations and were strengthened  to reflect stronger achievements. For example, to increase \nthe share of digital payments to total transactions, the BSP introduced a National Quick Response \nCode  Standard  for  payments,  promoted  payment  of  salaries  through  formal  accounts,  and \ndigitized payments in public transportation. Under subprogram 2, at the request of the government, \ntwo  policy  actions  were  added  to  reflect  (i)  the  financial  consumer  protection  policy  reforms \nintroduced by the government and (ii) the steps  taken to strengthen and diversify the NSFI, with \nthe Philippine  Commission on Women (PCW) participating in its implementation.17 \n \n\nStrategy  2030  Priority \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \nAccelerating progress in \ngender equality \n\nPromoting rural  development \nand f ood security \n\nTackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster \nresilience,  and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability \n\nStrengthening  governance \nand institutional capacity \n\nAlignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nProgram \nThe  program supports f inancial literacy and extends af f ordable f ormal \nf inancial services to the poor and rural  microenterprises,  which  have  a \ndirect impact on poverty reduction. \nThe  program supports approaches that address prevailing gender \ninequalities in  women\u2019s access to f inance and support women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment.   \nThe  program supports the government in strengthening  agriculture \nvalue  chain f inance and agriculture  insurance  through \nintergovernmental  dialogue, pilot testing of  new approaches, \ndevelopment of  tools to help mitigate risk and scale outreach,  and \npolicy ref orms. \nThe  program supports policies that directly and indirectly help to \nincrease  the climate and disaster resilience  of  individuals and micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises  throughout the  country, especially \nin the priority areas  that are  particularly vulnerable.

This reform area builds  on the  government\u2019s introduction  of institutional  reforms \nacross the financial sector to improve access to finance for low-income households and MSMEs. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Philippine  Statistics  Authority:  (i)  issued  implementing  rules  and \nregulations  to  guide  implementation  of  the  PhilSys,  which  include  provisions  to  facilitate \nregistration  of  children,  senior  citizens,  and  persons  with  disabilities;  (ii)  issued  procurement \npackages that constitute major  system implementation milestones; (iii) began pilot testing of the \nregistration  process; (iv) developed a monitoring and evaluation  framework; and (v) developed a \nstrategy for linking  the national  identification  to  increased financial  inclusion.  A well-functioning \nPhilSys will be critical to the implementation and integrity of social assistance programs similar to \n\n \n\n17 Further elaboration on the strengthened actions and additional actions taken by the government as compared to the \noriginal subprogram 2  indicative reforms, is  provided  in  Comparison  of Original and  Revised  Reforms  under \nSubprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthose  under  the  country\u2019s  COVID-19  response  program. 18  To  support  expanded  agriculture \nfinance  including  for  enterprises  owned  by  women  and  better  inform policymakers,  the  BSP \nhelped develop the AVCF framework through a pilot program for rural and thrift banks to increase \nlending to individuals and businesses  in the value chain.  \n \n16. \nThe  Insurance  Commission  developed  guidelines  for  distribution  channels  that  deliver \nmicroinsurance products to clients. It also supported a regulatory sandbox approach for a public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  (PPP)  pilot  to  expand  the  coverage  of agriculture  insurance  involving  the \nPhilippine  Crop  Insurance  Corporation  and  private  insurance  companies.  To  further  increase \nnationwide  financial  literacy,  the  BSP  developed  strategic  partnerships,  including  with  the \nDepartment of Education.19 The BSP also strengthened  financial consumer protection by issuing \nregulations  to  promote  access  to  high-quality  financial  services,  drafting  a  financial  consumer \nprotection  law, and  developing  a Chatbot  using  artificial intelligence  to provide  a more efficient \nand  accessible  way  to  reach  the  BSP  on  consumer  protection  matters.  Finally,  the  BSP \nstrengthened the NSFI\u2019s gender-responsive policies and actions by endorsing the membership of \nthe PCW in the NSFI steering committee and establishing a project steering committee to oversee \nthe  design  of  the  first  comprehensive  national  MSME survey with  a  gender  focus.  With  ADB \nsupport,  the BSP led  a national  stakeholder  workshop that  helped  define the  survey framework \nand  provided a  venue to discuss  key issues  related  to  women\u2019s entrepreneurship.  This  MSME \nsurvey complements the  enterprise  survey conducted by the  Department  of Finance (DOF) in \ncollaboration  with  ADB  to  investigate  the  impact  of  COVID-19 on  MSMEs in  the  Philippines, \nincluding enterprises  owned and/or led by women. \n \n17. \nUnder subprogram 3, the government will: (i) continue to implement PhilSys and link this \nto financial inclusion,  beginning  with 5 million  low-income household  heads  by December 2020 \nand reaching at least  50 million persons  by 2022;  (ii) further strengthen  AVCF by using  lessons \nfrom the pilot program to help expand support to other financial institutions;  and (iii) pursue further \nreforms that  support  women\u2019s  financial  inclusion  and  entrepreneurship  based  on  the  national \nMSME survey with a gender focus. Adoption of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework for \nthe NSFI and a gender impact assessment will support an updated NSFI action plan with gender-\nfocused targets  and  the establishment  of a  national  taskforce on  MSMEs owned and/or  led  by \nwomen.  The  program  will  expand  the  PPP  for  agriculture  insurance,  simplify  insurance \ninstruments to enhance access of marginalized sectors, and build on key partnerships  to expand \nfinancial literacy and financial consumer protection without discrimination.20 \n \n18. \nReform area 2: Infrastructure for financial inclusion strengthened. This reform area \nbuilds  on  the  government\u2019s efforts under  subprogram  1 to  improve the  national  retail  payment \nsystem,  launch  a  national  credit  registry,  establish  a  moveable  collateral  registry,  and  reform \ncredit guarantee schemes. Under subprogram 2, the BSP continued to enhance the national retail \npayment system and  support  the  expansion  of digital  payments.  The  number of  basic  deposit \naccounts  was  increased  through:  (i)  the  issuance  of guidelines  for ensuring  interoperability  of \n\n \n\n18 Signed into  law  on  24  March  2020,  the  Bayan  Bayanihan to  Heal  as  One  Act  includes a  \u20b1205  billion  Social \nAmelioration Program, a cash emergency subsidy program to ensure income and food security for up to 18 million \nfamilies (4P and non-4P) adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\n19 Through the partnership, the Department of Education incorporated financial literacy in the K to 12 Basic Education \nProgram (policy  finalization, development of  curriculum exemplars, and a  monitoring and evaluation framework \n[disaggregated by sex]  to  assess the financial literacy of teachers and students covering 47,000 public schools, \n800,000 teachers, and 29 million learners).   \n\n20 The Magna Carta of Women mandates government agencies to \u201cenhance access of women entrepreneurs/potential \nentrepreneurs  to  credit  and  capital  through,  among  others,  simplified insurance  instrument  through  contract \nstandardization.\u201d (Republic Act 9710. Sec. 26 (D). \n\n\frapid response-enabled  payment and financial services; (ii) a partnership  with the Department of \nLabor and Employment to promote payment of salaries through formal accounts and the digitizing \nof payments in public transportation;  and (iii) the issuance of guidelines  and standards to further \nextend the reach of a range of financial services, including  cash agents  and branch-lite units  to \nallow  approved  banks  to  act  as  a  microinsurance  agent  or  broker. 21  To  increase  financial \nconsumer protection and expand the credit history of low-income clients, the Microfinance NGO \nRegulatory  Council  (MNRC) required  accredited  MNGOs to  report  to  the  Credit  Information \nCorporation  (CIC),  which  will  expand  the  coverage  of  credit  information.  In  addition,  the \nCooperative  Development  Authority issued  regulations  requiring  all  borrowers  to  submit  basic \ncredit data to the CIC. The Personal  Property Security Act was signed into law in August 2018, \nand the Implementing Rules and Regulations  for the Act were issued in October 2019 to support \nthe development of a centralized and nationwide electronic collateral registry. Finally, to improve \nMSME access to more affordable credit and enable financial institutions  to lower their lending risk, \nthe government streamlined credit enhancement mechanisms by consolidating  and recapitalizing \nall  its  guarantee  programs  under  the  Philippine  Guarantee  Corporation  (PhilGuarantee),  and \nsubsequently  approving a restructuring plan. \n \n19. \nUnder  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  build  on  the  payments  infrastructure  by \npromoting  use  of the  national  quick response  code  standard  and  increasing  the  use  of digital \nchannels  for  government payments,  including  expansion  of payment  channels  to  support  the \ngovernment's  social  protection  programs.  The  government will  provide  licenses  to  more cash \nagents and increase financial literacy outreach to include gender-focused digital financial literacy \nstrategies.  Additional reforms will increase the coverage of the credit reporting system to expand \ncredit histories  of clients  and MSMEs and establish  linkages  to  PhilSys. The Land  Registration \nAuthority will increase awareness and use of the online collateral registry, and PhilGuarantee will \nexpand  the number  of MSMEs supported  through  state-financed guarantee-backed  lending  by \n10%, with a dedicated target for MSMEs owned and/or led by women. \n \nReform area 3: Capacity  of financial  service providers increased.  This  reform area \n20. \naims to  improve the  capacity of MNGOs and  rural  banks, and  to  expand their  reach. First,  the \nMNRC accredited and  monitored the compliance of MNGOs. The MNRC also provided training \nprograms  to  help  build  their  capacity  for  compliance  by  (i)  adapting  the  internal  information \ntechnology  systems  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  for  collecting  sex-\ndisaggregated  data covering boards of trustees, management personnel, and client borrowers of \nMNGOs, and  (ii)  designing  a training  program that will  help  the  MNRC and  MNGOs to  comply \nwith MNRC accreditation and CIC requirements, starting  with the development of a supervision \nmanual for MNGOs, pilot testing, and onsite training. As of March 2020, all 30 accredited MNGOs \nhave women on  their  boards.  Second,  to  further develop the  capacity of rural  banks,  the  BSP \nenabled  the  safe  use  of  cloud-based  core  banking  technology  by  issuing  guidelines  on \ncybersecurity and cloud computing, and authorized 26 rural and thrift banks to use a cloud-based \nsystem.22 Third, with the passage of the Islamic Banking Act, the BSP issued  implementing rules \non  the  licensing  Islamic  banks,  establishment  of  Islamic  banking  windows,  and  Shari\u2019ah \ngovernance principles. \n \n\n \n\n21 The BSP circulars and guidelines issued in 2018 and 2020 provide a framework for offering of basic deposit accounts \nand allowing banks to contract third party entities as cash agents. A branch-lite unit refers to any permanent office \nor place of business of a bank, other than its  head office or a  branch. A branch-lite unit performs limited banking \nactivities and records its transactions in the books of the head office or branch. \n\n22 Based on the results of the pilot supported under subprogram 1, the BSP issued non -objections for 25 rural banks to \n\noperate using cloud-based core banking systems. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fUnder  subprogram  3,  the  MNRC  will  continue  to  improve  its  collection  of  sex-\n21. \ndisaggregated  data and its conduct of onsite supervisory examinations of MNGOs. The BSP will \ncontinue  to  support  the  use  of  financial  technology  innovations  through  a  regulatory  sandbox \napproach, application of regulation technology solutions, and innovations that specifically address \nMSMEs led  by women who  are  unserved  or  underserved  because  of constraints  in  access to \nfinancial  services  from formal financial  institutions.  Finally,  the  government  will  take  steps  to \nincrease  the  availability  of Islamic  financial  services  through  awareness-raising  and  capacity-\ndevelopment activities, with special consideration  for women and enterprises  owned by women. \n \n22. \nADB experience. Starting  with the Rural Microenterprise Finance Project in 1996,  ADB \nhas  worked closely  with  the  government to  establish  a  foundation  for successful microfinance \nwholesale  lending  operations  and  to  contribute  to  the  growth  of  microfinance. 23 Subsequent \nprograms, such as the Microfinance Development Program helped to strengthen  regulatory and \nsupervisory  capacity  and  carried  out  a  national  microfinance literacy  program. 24 ADB  further \nsupported  the  development  of the  sector  with  the  Developing  Financial  Cooperatives  Project, \nwhich  improved  the  regulatory  environment  for  credit  and  savings  cooperatives,  and  the \nDeveloping  Microinsurance Project,  which  helped  the  government  set  up  a  suitable  regulatory \nenvironment  and  launch  the  National  Strategy  for Microinsurance  in  2010.25  These  programs \nprovided  a  conducive  regulatory  framework that  allowed  financial  inclusion.  Approval  of  the \nprogram in October 2018 provided support to address persistent constraints to increased financial \ninclusion (footnote 5). \n \n23. \nLessons. Key lessons  from ADB\u2019s long-term involvement in the development of a more \ninclusive finance sector provide valuable input to the program design and implementation.26 First, \na comprehensive strategy  with high-level  support,  such as  the NSFI, which address  types  and \naccessibility of products  and services offered, infrastructure and payment system, and  capacity \nof financial service providers is a prerequisite to effectively address the lack of access to financial \nservices.  Second,  to  successfully implement  reforms, government ownership  and  widespread \npolitical  will  are  necessary.  Third,  pilot  projects  that  test  new  strategies  through  a  regulatory \nsandbox approach are important for evidence-based policy development and building stakeholder \nsupport for institutional  reforms. Fourth, reforms and capacity development should  include close \nADB  involvement,  with  national  and  local  government  ownership  and  development  partner \nsupport.27  Fifth, financial inclusion becomes even more important in times of crisis to ensure that \nthe  poor  get  access  to  social  assistance.  Without  a  national  identification  system  linked  to  a \ndeposit  account,  the  government  was  challenged  to  distribute  grants  through  the  Social \nAmelioration Program to the non-4P families (footnote 18) (box).  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s value  addition to  program design and  implementation.  The  overall  program \ndesign  resulted  from close engagement with implementing agencies. The program incorporates \nknowledge  gained  from  sustained  ADB  policy  dialogue  and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA) \nimplementation. ADB has  supported  implementation of PhilSys in  key areas  by tapping  TA and \n\n \n\n23 ADB. 1996.

Under  subprogram  2,  with  transaction  advisory  support,  bidding \npackages were issued  for program elements (including for registration  kits and the Authenticated \nBiometric Identification  System) that  constitute  major program  milestones.28 With  ADB TA  and \nstaff support,  a  4-year implementation  road  map on  the  identification  system was  approved  in \nJanuary  2019. 29  The  road  map  includes  actions  to  increase  financial  inclusion  through \nstreamlined \nthat  would  enable  opening  of  accounts.  A \ncommunications  strategy  was  developed  as  well  as  an  overall  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework.  Additional  TA  supported  an  assessment  and  plan  for  upgrading \ninformation \ntechnology  systems to  facilitate integration  of PhilSys within  the  Department of Social  Welfare \nand  Development  and  to  help  increase  efficiency, reduce  cost,  and  better  support  the  4Ps \nconditional  cash  transfer program.30 Further,  ADB has  worked closely with the BSP to build  on \nsubprogram 1 reforms to collaboratively test ways to strengthen agriculture finance and insurance, \nimprove coordination  and  monitoring of financial literacy, and explore innovation  in  the banking \nsector using  financial technology.  ADB has also worked closely with the SEC to further develop \naccreditation  standards  for MNGOs to  professionalize  and  scale-up  their  operations.  Through \nadditional TA, ADB has provided awareness-raising  and capacity-building workshops and training \nfor government  and  civil  society  organizations  supporting  Islamic financial  services. 31 ADB will \nalso  be  supporting  gender-focused policy reforms that support  women\u2019s financial inclusion  and \nentrepreneurship,  which will be developed under subprogram 3.32 \n \n\nHow the Inclusive Finance Development Program Complements Other  \nAsian Development Bank Initiatives in the Philippines \n\nThe  Inclusive  Finance  Development  Program  (IFDP)  complements  and  supports  a  number  of  recent  Asian \nDevelopment Bank programs in the Philippines. The Competitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program aims \nto  support  the  government\u2019s effort  to  increase  competitiveness and  inclusiveness of  the  agriculture  sector  by  \n(i)  implementing agricultural trade policy and regulatory reforms, (ii) enhancing public services and finance for the \nsector, and (iii) increasing social protection to rural families.33 Under the IFDP, strengthening agriculture value chain \nfinance and incentivizing private sector participation in agriculture finance will reinforce the efforts to make agriculture \nin the Philippines more competitive and inclusive. Building the technology capacity of rural banks and extending digital \nplatforms for agriculture financial services under the IFDP will further enhance the impact and reach of the Competitive \nand Inclusive Agriculture Development Program. \n \nThe  Expanded Social Assistance Project, approved in May  2020, supports the  government\u2019s Pantawid Pamilyang \nPilipino Program by  financing a  portion of  the  education and  health conditional cash  transfers provided to  poor \nhouseholds; strengthening the Department of Social Welfare and Development\u2019s compli ance verification, payroll, and \ngrievance  redress  systems;  building  linkages  with  complementary  social  programs;  and  improving  project \nmanagement, monitoring, and impact evaluation.34 The  IFDP  will help accelerate and  enhance the  efficiency and \nimpact of  the  Expanded Social  Assistance  Project  with  the  rollout of  the  Philippine Identification System,  which \nprioritizes low-income heads of households and linkages of the identification system to a bank account. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n28 ADB's Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships has provided substantial TA from various sources and staff resources to \n\n29 ADB. 2016.

For  over  two  decades,  ADB  has  supported  the \n25. \ngovernment\u2019s goal of increasing  financial inclusion  in the Philippines  through close coordination \nand  collaboration  with  development  partners.  Overall  coordination  of  development  partner \nsupport has been managed through the NSFI steering committee, chaired by the BSP. Bilaterally, \nADB and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale  Zusammenarbeit have worked together to \ndevelop a strong regulatory framework and financial literacy for microinsurance and have jointly \nsupported  development of a pilot PPP program for agriculture insurance. Since 2018, the World \nBank  and  ADB have collaborated  to  support  implementation  and  rollout  of PhilSys.  ADB also \nclosely coordinates with the United States Agency for International  Development, which recently \napproved  additional  funding for the  E-PESO project that  supports  use  of \u202felectronic  payments, \nand  launched  the  Delivering\u202fEffective Government for  Competitiveness  and  Inclusive  Growth \nProgram to expand financing, markets, and linkages for MSMEs. Finally, in addition to its parallel \ncofinancing of subprogram 1, the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement will provide TA to support \nsubprogram 3 in key areas including  agriculture insurance, regulatory strengthening,  and digital \ntransformation of financial institutions.35,36 \n \nC. \n \n26. \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  program  impact  assessment  considers  the \nobjectives of the program and how likely the key reforms will generate economic benefits. Overall, \nthe  program  acts  as  a  catalyst  by  creating  an  appropriate  regulatory  structure  and  business \nenvironment and by encouraging businesses  to grow through the use of technology. The benefits \nof the  program  come from more adults  with  bank  accounts, which  are  necessary for financial \ninclusion. In addition to economic growth, the program will produce other social benefits, including \nreduced poverty; decreased inequality; improved financial stability; more opportunities for women; \nand increased climate resilience of the vulnerable poor, MSMEs, and financial institutions.37 \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe total  financing needs  of the  Philippines  in  2020 are expected to be substantial.  The \nannual  budget  deficit was originally  programmed at 3.2%  of GDP in  2020,  down  from 3.4%  in \n2019.  However, revenues  will  be  significantly  lower  because  of the  economic contraction  and \nhigher  spending  resulting  from the  impact of COVID-19, and the  deficit is  expected to  widen to \n8.4% of GDP in  2020. As such, the  government\u2019s financing requirement is  expected to  reach a \nrecord \u20b12.9 trillion ($58 billion), financed through domestic borrowing (74%) and foreign borrowing \n(26%). The government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources  to  help  finance subprogram  2. The  loan  will  have  a 15-year  term, including  a  grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending  facility; a  commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The loan size for subprogram 2 reflects \nthe government\u2019s development financing needs,  the strength  of the program, and the  economic \nbenefits (para. 26). \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  DOF  is  the  executing  agency.  The  BSP,  the  SEC,  PhilGuarantee,  the  Philippine \nStatistics Authority, the Department of Justice, and the Insurance Commission will be the primary \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n35 The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement anticipates to also cofinance  subprogram 2. \n36 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fimplementing agencies. Implementation will be overseen by a steering committee chaired by the \nDOF,  with  the  implementing  agencies  as  members.  The  implementation  periods  are  May \n2018\u2013 April 2020 for subprogram 2 and May 2020\u2013May 2023 for subprogram 3. The proceeds of \nthe policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n29. \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people\u2019s \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n30. \nPoverty. The  poor  are  most affected by the  low  levels  of financial  inclusion  across  the \ncountry as financial exclusion deprives them of opportunities to increase their income and mitigate \nvarious  risks  through  credit,  savings,  insurance,  pensions,  and  remittances.  COVID-19  is \nexpected to  exacerbate absolute  poverty in  the  short  term because  of the  weak labor  market, \ncritical  food  shortages,  reduced  or  eliminated  household  earnings,  and  a  drastic  decline  in \nremittances.  Measures  under  subprogram  2  will  help  create  opportunity  and  build  resilience, \nparticularly  among  poorer  segments  of  the  population  through  (i)  inclusion  in  the  PhilSys, \n(ii) increased  support  for agriculture  finance and  insurance,  (iii)  facilitation of basic deposit  and \ndigital accounts, and (iv) targeted financial literacy initiatives. \n \n31. \nGender.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements.  Financial \ninclusion  in the Philippines  continues to favor women, with a higher proportion  of women (39%) \nholding accounts as compared to men (30%) (footnote 9). At the same time, women face cultural, \nsocial,  and  educational  barriers,  including  the  lack of (i) formal documentation  of identification, \n(ii) immovable properties and assets  owned under their names, (iii) financial independence  from \ntheir partners  or from other family members, and (iv) mobility. Many of these barriers are linked \nto  their  role  as  their  families\u2019 primary caretakers.  The  program targets  reforms while  ensuring \nconsideration  of the unique  challenges  faced by women and businesses  owned by women. Key \npolicy  measures  under  subprogram  2  supported  financial  inclusion  among  women  through: \n(i) implementation of a national  identification system, considering that women are less likely than \nmen to have identification documents required  to open a  bank account; (ii) introduction  of cash \nagents  and  other  financial  technology innovations  such  as  digital  platforms,  which can benefit \nmore  women  in  areas  without  a  banking  presence;  (iii)  strengthening  of  MNGOs,  which \npredominantly serve women; (iv) increased diversity and impact of activities in the NSFI with the \ninclusion  of the  PCW in  the  financial inclusion  steering  committee; and (v) approval of the  first \ncomprehensive MSME demand study with a gender  focus. The collection of sex-disaggregated \ndata has been prioritized  throughout the program. Subprogram 3 is expected to achieve effective \ngender  mainstreaming  through  the  inclusion  of  the  PCW  to  the  NSFI  and  the  results  of  the \ncomprehensive MSME survey which will be used to (i) approve an updated an NSFI action plan \nwith gender-focused targets,  (ii) adopt a national  definition of women-owned or led  businesses, \n(iii) establish  and chair a national   task force on women-owned or led businesses,  and (iv) adopt \na  robust  monitoring  and  valuation  framework  for  measuring  progress  that  includes  sex -\ndisaggregated  data. \n \nGovernance. While an updated assessment of the 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial \n32. \nAccountability report is being  carried out, the government has  set an aggressive reform agenda \nto promote effective and honest governance and to create an enabling  environment for citizens \nand  the  private sector.  The framework of the  Public Financial  Management Reform Roadmap, \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f2017\u20132022  aims to strengthen  the foundation of the public financial management system.38 The \nkey reforms target  improvements in  costing,  cash  management,  planning  and  budgeting,  and \nprocurement.  The  government's  performance  relative  to  international  fiscal  transparency \nstandards  and indicators of corruption has improved. The draft public financial accountability act \nwill further clarify rules and policies on budget formulation, preparation, enactment, and execution \nand significantly improve linkages between budgeting and planning,  congressional powers of the \npurse, and oversight of public spending. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government, including the DOF. \n \n33. \nRisks and mitigating measures. Overall risks are considered substantial  because of the \neconomic, financial,  and  social  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  on  the  country. Areas  of \nhighest  risk include  changes in  political priorities  preventing implementation  of identified  reform \nareas,  a  significant  and  rapid  deterioration  in  macroeconomic conditions,  and  corresponding \nincrease in poverty rates. The government's rapid, targeted fiscal policy response to the pandemic \nand  an  accommodating  monetary  policy  stance  signal  a  readiness  to  take  further  steps  as \nnecessary  to  strengthen  macroeconomic conditions.39 The  lack of sufficient capacity limits  the \nability  of relevant  government agencies  to  upgrade  their  existing  systems to support  increased \nfinancial  inclusion.  ADB  has  helped  mitigate  risks  through  TA  prior  to  and  throughout \nimplementation of the program and will continue to engage in regular policy dialogue through the \nNSFI  steering  committee. 40  ADB  and  other  development  partners  will  mitigate  the  risk  of \ncorruption with a whole-of-government approach to strengthen public financial management and \nimprove procurement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n34. \nThe government, including the DOF, has assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies  including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  gender, procurement, consulting  services, and  disbursement  as described  in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \n\n \n35. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nthe loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the \nInclusive Finance Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  15  years, \nincluding  a grace period  of 3  years; and such other  terms and conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board, and \nthe  inclusion  of  subprogram  3  in  the  programmatic approach,  as  described  in \nparagraph 4. \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n30 July 2020 \n\n \n\n38 DBM Bulletin.

To  institutionalize f inancing \n\nconsumer protection, the BSP \n(i)   submits the Financial \nConsumer  Protection Act to \nCongress, which mandates \nf inancial persons to, among \nothers, observe f air and \nrespectf ul treatment  of  clients \nregardless of  race, ethnicity, \norigin, gender, disability, and \nsexual orientation; and \n(ii)  implements the  Chatbot to \nprovide the public a more \naccessible and ef f icient means \nto engage the BSP on f inancial \nconsumer concerns. \n\n \n\n\f22  Appendix 4 \n\n1.4  NSFI  action plan \nstrengthened. \n\nThe  government supports and enhances  the outreach  and impact of  the NSFI.  Actions include: \n \n\n7.   To  f urther promote women\u2019s \n\nwith a  more accessible and \nef f icient means to engage the \nBSP on f inancial consumer \nconcerns. \n\n7.   To  promote women\u2019s f inancial \ninclusion, the   BSP as chair  of  \nthe NSFI  Steering  Committee \n(i)  endorsed the inclusion of  the \nPCW  as a f ull member of  the \nCommittee; and (ii) conducted \nthe f irst national stakeholder \nworkshop, with participation of  \nPCW  as a member of  the project \nsteering committee, on the \ndesign of  the f irst \ncomprehensive, national MSME \nsurvey with a  gender f ocus, \ncomplementing the enterprise \nsurvey conducted by the DOF in \ncollaboration with ADB \ninvestigating the impact of  \nCOVID-19  on Philippine MSMEs, \nincluding f emale owned or led \nenterprises.  \n\n \n \n\nf inancial inclusion, based on the \noutcome of  the MSME demand \nsurvey, the NSFI  Steering \nCommittee and project steering \ncommittee will (i)   approve an \nupdated NSFI  action plan with \ngender f ocused targets; \n(ii)   adopt a national  def inition of  \nwomen-owned  or led \nbusinesses; (iii)  establish and \nchair  a national taskf orce on \nwomen-owned  or led MSMEs; \n(iv) develop guidelines on \ngender-responsive procurement \nto promote women \nentrepreneurship  and access to \nsupply value chains; (v) \nrecommend policy and f inancial \nsupport measures to rescue \naf f ected MSMEs in light of  \nCOVID-19,  especially targeting \nwomen-owned  MSMEs through \na phased approach including \nloan restructuring  and new  credit \ndelivery, with  f ocus on business \nand employment retention;  and \n(vi) adopt a robust monitoring \nand evaluation f ramework f or \nthe NSFI  f or measuring \nprogress, which includes gender \nimpact assessment. \n\nReform  Area  2: Infrastructure  for financial  inclusion strengthened. \n\nThe  government continues to upgrade the retail  payment system. Actions include:  \n\n \n\n\f2.1 Payment \ninfrastructure  developed. \n\n \n \n\n6.   The  BSP issued  a policy \n\n8.   The  share  of digital \n\nframework  to promote  the \nestablishment  of  a safe, \nefficient,  and interoperable \nnational  retail payment  system \n(NRPS)  that  allows (i)  transfer \nfunds  from one  bank  or \nfinancial  service  provider  to \nanother  through  transaction \naccounts,  and (ii) any  qualified \nfinancial  service  provider  to \nparticipate  on a level  playing \nfield. The goal is to  drive usage \nof electronic  payments  from \nthe  current  1%  to  20%  by 2020 \nand promote  a  digital finance \necosystem  that  can  facilitate \nthe  deployment  of  a wide \nrange  of affordable  financial \nproducts  and services. \n\n(IA: BSP) \n\nbanking and payments industry \nto establish two ACHs f or (i) \nbatched electronic f und transf er \ncredit that could be used to \nreplace checks, and (ii)  real  time \nlow value push that enables low \nvalue  electronic f und transf ers. \n\n(IA: BSP) \n8.

Among others, \nthe guidelines allow the cash \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\n8.   To further  increase  the share \nof  digital payments  equitably \nand comprehensively,  the \nBSP (i) collects  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  to identify \ndifference  in use  patterns  and \nrefine  delivery  interventions, \n(ii) scales  up adoption  of the \nNational  QR  Code  Standard \nfor payments,  (iii) supports \nDOLE  to promote  payment  of \nsalaries  through  formal \naccounts  and  digitizing \npayments  in public \ntransportation,  and \n(iv)  mainstreams  the \ngovernment\u2019s  BTMS  that \nenables  direct  transfer  of \npayments  to suppliers \nthrough  PESONet  integration.   \n\ntransactions  increased  from \n8%  in 2013  to 20%  in 2019  by \nvalue  and from  1%  in 2013  to \n8%  in 2019  by volume. To \nachieve  this, the  BSP (i) issued \namendments  to regulations  on \nElectronic  Banking  Services, \n(ii) introduced   a National  QR \nCode  Standard  for payments \nnecessary  for ensuring \ninteroperability  of QR-enabled \npayment  and financial \nservices,  (iii) formulated  a \npartnership  with DOLE  to \npromote  payment  of salaries \nthrough  formal  accounts  and \ndigitizing payments  in public \ntransportation,  and (iv)   pilot \ntested  the  government\u2019s  BTMS \nthat  enables  direct  transfer  of \npayments  to suppliers  through \nPESONet  integration. \n\n9.  To extend the reach  of  traditional \nbranches, the  BSP (i)  issued \npolicies to support \nimplementation of  cash agents \nand guidelines f or usage of  \nbranch-lites, and established \nstandards f or the conduct of  \n\n9.
