The Project focuses on capacity building for teacher \nAssessment  development, and will have no negative environmental impact.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will support the Government\u2019s development goals by \nsupporting improvements in the quality of secondary education \nthrough extensive support for teacher education for general upper \nsecondary and professional secondary education.  \n   \nRationale  The  Government  strongly  emphasizes  the  need  to  expand \nsecondary  education,  particularly  professional  secondary  (PS) \neducation. It recognizes that expansion must be accompanied by \nimprovements in quality if the education system is to meet the \ncountry\u2019s  needs  for  a  skilled  and  well-qualified  labor  force. \nEnrollment  projections  indicate  significant  rates  of  growth  until \n2010.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  by \nimproving the quality of upper secondary (US) education and PS, \nthereby producing a better qualified and more productive work \nforce. The project outcomes will be (i) improved quality of US and \nPS  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training;  (ii)  expanded \naccess  for ethnic minorities, particularly women, to US and PS \nteacher  development;  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  for  planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of teacher training for US and PS; and \n(iv)  improved  facilities  to  strengthen  instructional  capability  in \nteacher training institutes. The Project will (i) enhance access and \nequity, training quality, efficiency, and management; (ii) sponsor a \nnational teacher development system to integrate preservice and \nin-service training; and (iii) provide targeted support to (a) teacher \ntraining  institutes  (TTIs)  in  ethnic  minority  areas;  (b)  ethnic \nminority students, particularly women; and (c) TTIs in areas with \nrapid economic growth. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $43.18 million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties.  \n   \n ", "ii \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  34.00  78.70 \nGovernment  9.18  21.30 \n  Total  43.18  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A  loan  of  $34,000,000  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe term of the loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will finance 78.7% of \nthe  project  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining \n21.3% by providing $9.18 million as counterpart financing. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  June 2007\u201331 December 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \n   \nImplementation  MOET will have overall responsibility for project coordination and \nArrangements  implementation.  A  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished within MOET for project implementation. The PMU will \nhave  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  including \nprocurement, planning, budgeting, monitoring, coordinating, and \nreporting.  The  PMU  Director  will  be  responsible  for  reporting \nprogress of the project to the Minister/Vice-Minister on a regular \nbasis.  Each  beneficiary  TTI  will  also  establish  a  Project \nImplementation  Unit  (PIU).  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation of Project activities in their respective TTIs and \nwill  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  PMU.  Project \nManagement  Cells  (PMCs),  headed  by  an  official  of  DOET, \nmaybe established in project provinces for coordinating project \nactivities at the provincial level. Each PMC will submit quarterly \nreports to the PMU.  \n   \nProcurement  All goods and works financed under the Project will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as \namended  from  time  to  time)  reflecting  ADB's  policy  on \nanticorruption.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A total input of 132 person-months of international consulting and \n492  person-months  of  national  consulting  will  be  provided  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting \nservices  cover  broad  areas  of  expertise  that  include  (i)  policy \nevaluation and reform, (ii) teacher education preservice curriculum \nand instructional material design, (iii) teacher education in-service \n ", "  iii \ncurriculum  and  instructional  material  design,  (iv)  accreditation \nprocedures,  (v)  teacher  registration  procedures,  (vi)  data \ncollection  and  analysis,  (vii)  information  and  communication \ntechnology curriculum, (viii) educational management information \nsystem  development,  and  (ix)  facilities  and  equipment \nimprovement.  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  for \nprocurement,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nConsulting firms will be recruited for the remaining services and \nrecruitment will be carried out using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will have substantial benefits for the education sector, \nBeneficiaries  in particular secondary education, through systemic improvements \nfor design, delivery, and management of teacher development for \nUS and PS. \n \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project will be (i) current and future \nUS and PS teachers who will have continuing opportunities to \nimprove  their  professional  competencies  through  improved \npreservice  and  in-service  training  programs;  and  (ii)  ethnic \nminority groups, particularly women, who will have greater access \nto  quality  teacher  training  programs  through  provision  of \nscholarships, dormitories, and enhanced facilities in TTIs serving \nethnic minority areas. The project-initiated improvement in their \nprofessional development will better ensure that all US and PS \nstudents are provided with a school experience that contributes to \nlife choices, to reduction of poverty through greater employability, \nand to the achievement of national economic development goals \nthrough a better qualified work force. The indirect beneficiaries will \nbe current and future US and PS students who will benefit from \ninstruction from a better qualified teaching force. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The major project risk emanates from the number of institutions to \nbe supported by the Project and the combination of hardware and \nsoftware  inputs.  This  will  require  considerable  management \ncapacity  within  the  project  management  unit  to  ensure  project \ninputs within the time lines and resources outlined. The Project \nmitigates this risk by requiring establishment of coordination and \noversight  committees  within  the  project  management  unit  and \neach  beneficiary  TTI  to  monitor  progress  and  take  timely \nmeasures to address delays.  \n \nAny faltering of commitment to review policy issues related to \nteacher  development,  including  recruitment,  deployment, \nstandardization  of  qualifications,  and  career  development,  will \nimpact  policy  formulation.  The  Government  has  expressed  its \nsupport for a comprehensive policy framework. The Project will \nsupport  this  policy  framework  with  an  agreed  implementation \nframework.  \n \nAdequate  budgetary  provision  will  be  needed  for  postproject \n ", "iv \noperation and maintenance costs to maximize benefits through \nproperly maintained facilities and updated databases. Additional \nresources  will  be  needed  for  periodic  upgrading  of  training \ncurriculum and in-service training, as determined by the policy \nreview. Budgetary support for education increased from 3.5% of \ngross domestic product in 1996 to 4.6% in 2005. In view of the \nprojected  robust  growth  of  the  national  economy,  budgetary \nsupport  for  education  is  expected  to  remain  strong.  The \nGovernment has also committed to providing adequate resources \nto support reforms undertaken by the Project. \n \n ", "103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nVIET NAM\nOF  CHINA\nHa Giang UPPER SECONDARY AND\n9 Cao Bang\n7 PROFESSIONAL TEACHER\nLao Cai\n1 6 10 DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nLai Chau 4 Bac Kan\nTuyen Quang 16 Lang Son\n2 Ye8n Bai 11 Thai Nguyen\nSon La Phu Tho 12Vin1h3 Phuc Bac1 G8iang 17\nDien Bien 5\n3 HANOI 1419 Ha Long\n20 15 Hai 21\nHoa Binh Duong Hai Phong\n23 24 22\nThai Binh\n25 26 Gulf   of   Tonkin\nNinh Binh\n20 o 00\u2019N LAO PEOPLE'S 27 20 o 00\u2019N\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC Thanh Hoa\n28 PROVINCES\n1.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet Nam  for  the  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.   RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Viet  Nam  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  access  to  education,  having \nachieved a net enrollment ratio (NER) in 2005 of 94% for primary education and 51% for \nsecondary (a significant increase for secondary from 18.7% in 1993). Annual enrollment in \nupper secondary (US) education over the past 9 years increased by an average of 12.9%, while \nthe corresponding increase in the vocationally oriented professional secondary (PS) education \nwas  11%.  The  Government  projects  that  average  annual  increases  in  US  enrollment  will \ngradually decline from 14.6% in 2005 to 4.8% in 2010. However, the Government expects \nparticipation in US by 2010 will be 60%, exceeding its target of 50%. PS enrollment increases \nare expected to rise from an annual rate of 4.9% in 2005 to 14.6% in 2010, creating ambitious \nteacher expansion targets. Together, both subsectors will require approximately 58,000 more \nteachers until 2010\u2014an increase of 43.9% excluding the needs arising from attrition rates \nnotionally set at 5% per annum. This large increase will strain the ability of teacher training \ninstitutes (TTIs) to supply the teachers required if current student-teacher ratios are to continue. \nIf lower ratios are to be realized to enhance student learning, demand for additional teachers will \nbe even higher.  \n3.  The challenge is not only to increase the number of trained teachers but also to enhance \nthe quality of training. The Government also recognizes the need to improve classroom teaching \nmethodologies to engender in future students the knowledge and creative skills required to \ncontribute  to  the  achievement  of  declared  national  development  goals.  This  will  require \nimproving  TTIs\u2019  capacity  to  modernize  staff  training  techniques.  Further,  accreditation \nprocedures need to be established for training institutions to ensure standardization and quality \nof the training curriculum. Finally, progressive consistency is needed between preservice and in-\nservice training.  \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy is growing faster than that of all other Southeast Asian countries. \nThe Government places significant emphasis on expanding the reach of and improving the \nquality of education to sustain the pace of economic growth and maintain competitiveness. \nSince primary education is almost universal, the secondary education sector is particularly \npositioned for rapid expansion.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  As the economy continues to expand, school graduates need to be better equipped with \nthe wide range of problem-solving and research skills that emerging knowledge industries \nrequire. In response, a new curriculum has been developed for US that changes pedagogy from \nreliance on passive learning to an emphasis on student-centered learning that fosters curiosity \nand creativity. Teachers in schools need to be retrained in the new pedagogy, including the use \nof information technology; and those training to be teachers need to achieve a reconstructed \nview  of  teaching.  To  acquire  these  new  skills,  trainee  teachers  need  to  experience  them \nthroughout their training, so that they discover the benefits of enquiry-based learning and its \n ", "2   \napplication to personal development and employability. This will require TTI staff to update their \nown teaching methods to model the best teaching styles, including more informed monitoring \nand assessment techniques to ensure the effectiveness and quality of their trainees\u2019 learning. \nThe use of information technology needs to be an integral part of teacher training programs, as \nstudents will be working in an increasingly rich information technology environment throughout \ntheir careers. A summary of the key issues follows.  \n1.  Access \n6.  Even though significant progress has been made in improving access to education, the \nNER for US is still low at approximately 51%. Ethnic minority students are underrepresented at \n9.4%  of  total  enrollment.  Even  though  enrollment  rates  of  ethnic  minority  students  are \nincreasing,  they  are  still  below  those  of  the  general  population.  Poverty  is  a  significant \ndeterminant of disadvantage with a NER of 17.1% for the poorest compared with 67.2% for the \nrichest.1 Urban\u2013rural enrollment disparities are significant with 59.2% of students enrolled in \nurban areas against 37.7% in rural areas. Rural areas also have significantly lower school \ncompletion  rates.  For  some  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  in  remote  rural  areas, \nattendance at school is far below other groups; and poverty among ethnic minority groups is \ndeclining at a lower rate than in the general population. Overall labor force participation rates \nare lower for women, although they are well represented in the teaching force. Of all US \nteachers,  approximately  56.1%  are  women  and  3.5%  are  from  ethnic  minorities.  Women \nrepresent 45% of PS teachers; corresponding data for ethnic minority representation is not \navailable.  \n7.  The remote mountain  areas continue to have difficulty attracting qualified teachers. \nResidents have poor access to teaching as a career, and teachers in isolated areas have poor \naccess to in-service support. Increased support is needed to improve access to teacher training \nprograms  for  students  from  ethnic  minorities  and  people  from  remote  rural  areas;  and  to \nimprove the quality of teacher education programs, both preservice and in-service, so that local \nteachers have the opportunity to develop professional competencies and pedagogical skills. \n2.  Quality \n \n8.  Curriculum and Assessment. While new curriculum standards have been developed \nfor primary and lower secondary teacher training courses, no corresponding improvements have \nbeen  introduced  for  either  US  or PS  teacher  training.  Training  improvements  are  urgently \nneeded to support the new school curriculum and model pedagogy that encourages students to \nexplore complex ideas and use knowledge in creative, problem-solving ways.  \n \n9.  Teacher  Quality.  Seventeen  percent  of  PS  teachers  are  underqualified.  Teacher \ntraining courses, in general, tend to be based on traditional passive approaches to learning\u2014in \nstark contrast to the Government\u2019s stated policy of significantly improving current classroom \npractice by shifting from passive to active learning through more creative and student-centered \npedagogy, including the use of information technology. \n \n10.  In-service support for teachers is needed to ensure that teachers\u2019 professional practice \nremains up-to-date and relevant. This will require strong links between preservice and in-service \ntraining courses to ensure that teacher education is a consistent, logical, career-long process. \nInduction programs need to be developed to support teachers in their first year of teaching as \n                                                 \n1  2004. Vietnam Development Report. Hanoi. \n ", "3 \nmany teaching graduates have had only limited or no practice in actual classroom teaching. \nSuch  induction  programs  will  help  improve  the  performance  of  beginner  teachers,  and\u2014\nconsistent with international practice\u2014help retain young teachers within the profession. \n \n  3.  Upper Secondary and Professional Secondary Education \n \n11.  The final phase of secondary education is divided into two subsectors. US provides \ngeneral education with a focus on higher education, while PS has a major focus on technical \nand vocational training. US is the much larger of the two subsectors. In 2005 it accounted for \n85.7% of schools, 88.4% of teachers, and 85.7% of students. It has lower student-teacher ratios \nof 26.29:1 compared with 33.47:1 for PS. While both subsectors have experienced similar \nenrollment growth over the past 5 years, the PS growth rates for teachers and number of \nschools  are  much  lower.  The  Government\u2019s  recent  enrollment  projections  for  2005\u20132010 \nindicate an average growth rate of 8% for US and 15% for PS. Statistics also indicate that \namong regions student-teacher ratios for US are very similar, but vary considerably for PS. The \nMekong River Delta and the South East regions appear to be disadvantaged, as they have \nconsiderably  higher  ratios  than  elsewhere.  Higher  demand  for  vocational  education  as \nevidenced by rapidly increasing enrollment and government's emphasis on vocational education \nreflect  the  human  resource  needs  of  a  rapidly  growing  economy.  A  detailed  sector  and \nsubsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  Currently, responsibility for preservice teacher training is dispersed among a wide range \nof institutions with an uneven geographic distribution. Despite the large number of institutions \nproviding preservice training, capacity to meet projected demand is likely to be stretched and \nsome areas have unmet demand in some subjects. Pedagogy and the quality of all TTI courses \nneed to be improved through appropriate accreditation procedures to ensure a high standard of \nentry competencies of all new teachers.  \n \n  4.  Management and Institutional Capacity \n \n13.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has  a  complex  structure  under  a \nminister  of  education  and  training,  supported  by  six  vice  ministers  responsible for  various \ndepartments within the education portfolio (Supplementary Appendix A). This complexity can \ncreate  both  policy  and  data  collection  difficulties,  with  various  departments  communicating \ninadequately with one another. At the same time, decentralization is occurring, albeit gradually. \nLocal departments of education and training (DOETs) are being given greater authority, as \nschool principals. Within the teacher training sector, MOET is responsible for the management \nof preservice training, while the DOETs play a stronger role in in-service training. MOET has \nlimited capacity to provide accurate and timely information, or to analyze trends to better plan \nfuture policies and programs. This constrains its ability to ensure quality of planning associated \nwith teacher training. Although MOET has exhibited strong commitment to education, it needs \nsupport  to  develop  a  policy  and  quality  assurance  framework  for  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment; and an information management system that will allow it to plan and manage the \ntraining and career development of the large teaching force. The Project will provide capacity-\nbuilding support for developing a comprehensive policy framework for teacher education; for an \naccreditation process for training courses; and a teacher information management system, \nincluding professional profiles of teachers.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \n  5.  Government Policies \n \n14.  The Government accords very high priority to education as a tool for achieving its \nnational  development  goals.  The  Government\u2019s  Education  Development  Strategic  Plan  for \n2001\u20132010 outlines the major educational reforms. The Government has also committed that \nwithin the education sector it will increase support to PS to improve the quality and number of \ntechnical workers. This policy responds to a perceived need to better match human capital \ndevelopment with industry needs. In May 2005, the minister of education and training released a \ndocument identifying 59 areas for improvement\u2014at least half are relevant to the Project.2 The \nProject  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  educational  goals,  and  proposes  activities  to \nsupport relevant areas for improvement that cover both preservice and in-service education; \nand include improved pedagogy, accreditation, contemporary knowledge and skills, and an \nincreased focus on PS. The Government has matched its stated commitment to education with \nhigher budgetary allocations. Education\u2019s share as a percentage of gross domestic product \nincreased  from  3.5%  in  1996  to  4.6%  in  2004.  However,  despite  increasing  budgetary \nallocations, rapid expansion at higher levels of education, particularly secondary education, will \ncontinue to strain available resources. Expansion occurs at the expense of quality, unless \nresources are specifically targeted to quality enhancement interventions.  \n \n  6.  Education Sector Strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n \n15.  The vision for education of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as stated in its policy \ndocument  Education  (2002),  is  that  all  children  and  adults  will  have  equitable  access  to \neducation of sufficient quality to empower them to break out of the poverty cycle, improve their \nquality  of  life,  and  participate  effectively  in  national  development.  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy also calls for support for provision of basic services, including education, as a key \npoverty reduction measure.  \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the education sector in Viet Nam has evolved to emphasize the \nconsolidation of investments made during past projects and to build upon them toward holistic \nplanning  and  management  for  the  education  sector.  The  process  began  under  the  ADB- \nfinanced Primary Education Development Project. It was then extended through the Lower \nSecondary Education Development Project, including the lower secondary Teacher Training \nProject,  which  created  infrastructure  for  teacher  training  and  will  be  strengthened  and \nconsolidated under the ongoing Upper Secondary Education Development Project. The Upper \nSecondary and Professional Teacher Development Project will provide critical complementary \nsupport  to  past  and  ongoing  initiatives  in  secondary  education  by  improving  teacher \ncompetencies, an area recognized to be the key to improving education quality. Therefore, the \nProject complements ADB\u2019s support for US, where ADB is the lead funding agency. The Project \nis designed to support ADB\u2019s strategy of taking a longer term perspective of sector development \nand committing to a series of interventions that focus on high-priority goals and measurable \ntargets within a sector policy framework. ADB assistance to the education sector in Viet Nam is \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s priorities of improving access to and quality of secondary \neducation.  The  Project  supports  the  targets  of  the  Government\u2019s  Education  Development \nStrategic  Plan  for  2001\u20132010  of  increasing  enrollment  in  US  and  PS  through  selective \nexpansion of physical facilities in selected TTIs; and supporting poverty reduction through a \n                                                 \n2  Government of Viet Nam. 2005.

The Project also supports ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nViet Nam,3 which emphasizes support for the Government\u2019s educational reforms. \n \n7.  External Assistance \n \n17.  External assistance to Viet Nam reached $2 billion in 2003, placing Viet Nam among the \ntop 10 recipient countries. Education\u2019s share of external assistance ranges from 8.5% to 10%. \nWithin education expenditures, external assistance will continue to play an important role in \neducation  development.  ADB  is  the  lead  funding  agency  in  the  education  sector  having \nsupported five projects for lower and upper secondary education since 1999. The World Bank is \nthe other major funding agency with support concentrated on basic and higher education. Other \nfunding  agencies  supporting  the  education  sector  include  the  European  Union,  France, \nGermany,  Japan,  Netherlands  and  the  United  Kingdom  (Appendix  3).  To  increase  the \neffectiveness of external assistance, and given the level of development of the education sector, \nsome funding agencies are piloting provision of output-based budgetary support for specific \ngovernment initiatives for primary education. This may be a precursor to broader program-\nbased lending or may signal a shift to a mixed modality sector-wide approach. ADB is currently \nproviding technical assistance to undertake a comprehensive assessment for possible program \nassistance. However, the needs for teacher training for US and PS require targeted attention, \nparticularly  for  system-wide  curriculum  and  pedagogical  reform.  The  Project  provides  this \nsupport and will help prepare this subsector to be better equipped to benefit from evolving \nsector funding modalities. \n  8.  Lessons  \n \n18.  Extensive funding agency support to the education sector in Viet Nam, and ADB\u2019s own \nexperience provide important lessons for maximizing the benefits of this Project and, in a few \ncases, for avoiding certain risks. While the benefits found are consistent with those outlined \nwithin the Project, the lessons relevant for the current Project are (i) overall project management \nquality is weak and needs to be strengthened so that project activities are undertaken in a timely \nmanner, and clear accountability guidelines need to be established and followed; (ii) the focus of \ntechnical assistance should be sharpened for building capacity of education staff and experts; \n(iii) management ability for education and training needs strengthening; (iv) decision making \nprocesses are slow; (v) staff within project management units change frequently; and (vi) project \ndesign should be clear (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n19.  Project  preparation  was  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s  education  policies,  in-depth \nsituation  analysis,  and  a  review  of  lessons  identified  from  experience.  The  Project  places \nsignificant emphasis on (i) ensuring policy coherence for teacher development; (ii) strengthening \ncapacity of education staff and experts for improved planning, management, and delivery of \nteacher education; and (iii) improving access for ethnic minorities. The Project has detailed \ndesign with all activities clearly described; it provides for strengthened coordination by the \nproject authorities and the institutions responsible for delivery of project outputs. In addition, the \nProject provides for an international expert to be located within the project management unit \n(PMU) to advise on project implementation in addition to other substantive tasks.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

The goal of the Project is to help reduce poverty in Viet Nam by improving the quality of \nUS and PS, thereby producing a better qualified and more productive work force. The outcomes \nof the Project will be (i) improved quality of US and PS preservice and in-service teacher \ntraining; (ii) expanded access for ethnic minorities, particularly women, to US and PS teacher \ndevelopment; (iii) strengthened capacity for planning, management, and delivery of teacher \ntraining for US and PS; and (iv) improved facilities to strengthen instructional capability in the \nTTIs. The Project will enhance access and equity, training quality, efficiency, and management. \nIt will help strengthen the national teacher development system to integrate preservice and in-\nservice training. The Project will provide targeted support to (i) TTIs in ethnic minority areas; (ii) \nethnic minority students, particularly women; and (iii) TTIs in areas of high enrollment and rapid \neconomic growth.  \nB.   Outputs \n1.  Enhance Quality of US and PS Preservice and In-Service Teacher Training  \n21.  Improvement in the quality of teaching is essential for producing a more capable work \nforce. Education must meet the needs of a rapidly growing economy for competent problem-\nsolvers who are imaginative, adaptable, and creative. To accomplish this, the changing skills \nmix required of school graduates must be reflected in the way teachers are trained. This \nrequires new approaches, as most teachers continue to teach in traditional ways in which they \nthem selves were taught. The inputs integral to this component have been placed under two \nmajor  headings\u2014Preservice  Teacher  Training  and  In-service  Teacher  Training\u2014and  are \ndetailed below:  \n \na.  Preservice Teacher Training \n22.  Alignment of the Teacher-Training Curriculum with the School Curriculum. MOET \nwill develop guidelines, develop a training curriculum framework and to review current training \ncourses to reflect the changes in the school curriculum. The guidelines will establish clear \nrequirements  for  review  to  determine  relevance  of  courses,  and  examine  the  need  for \nintroduction  of  new  courses,  especially  for  PS  education,  where  it  is  essential  that  all \nprofessional school subjects be covered by current TTI courses and where the employment \ncommunity likely to absorb PS graduates will be given an opportunity to contribute curriculum \nideas. Selected TTIs will be commissioned to develop specific course outlines for all subject \namendments and for new subjects. \n \n23.  Improve  Content  and  Methodology  of  Training  Programs.  The content  and  the \npedagogy of courses will be improved to meet established accreditation criteria. To improve \npedagogy, 20 6-month fellowships will be provided for staff to develop, trial, and document the \neffectiveness of new approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment. These fellowships will \nalso explore increased use of information technology in course design and delivery, and support \nan inclusive curriculum to address issues of ethnic minorities and gender. A common theme in \nthe  fellowships  will  be  the  development  of  more  active,  inclusive,  and  problem-solving \napproaches to teacher training. To develop new curriculum content, pedagogical guidelines, and \ncontact  teaching  requirements  for  20  pedagogical  courses,  MOET  will  contract  adequate \n ", "7 \nqualified  personnel  to  develop  the  20  courses  which  are  consistent  with  the  guidelines \ndeveloped and issued by MOET. \n \n24.  Provide Induction Program for Beginner Teachers. Internationally, the first year of \nteaching is seen as a bridge between initial training and full registration. Many skills, attitudes, \nand approaches to teaching are formed during the teachers\u2019 first year, including decisions on \nwhether their career will be in teaching or elsewhere. The Project will introduce a supportive \ninduction program for beginner teachers\u2014to be conducted by DOETs and school principals\u2014to \nretain them in the teaching force, habituate them to high classroom standards, and induce self-\nconfidence.  \n \n25.  Enhance  Use  of  Information  Technology  in  Preservice  Programs.  Accreditation \ncriteria  for  training  courses  will  require  that,  where  appropriate,  information  technology \napplications be incorporated in course design. As part of training in accreditation standards, TTI \nstaff will be assisted to use information technology applications within training programs. Each \nTTI will train all first-year teacher trainees in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft \nPowerPoint, etc., so that they use these skills throughout their 4 years of training. This will \nensure that all teachers are familiar with information technology and can increasingly use it to \nplan and evaluate their own and their students\u2019 performance.  \n \n26.  Developing TTIs to serve as Lead Universities. Five TTIs will be provided support to \nserve as lead universities (LUs) and to develop professional partnerships with leading overseas \nuniversities. Consultants from the overseas universities will work with LU faculty for a total of 12 \nmonths in the LUs, helping design and implement new approaches to teacher training, including \nassessment of outcomes. As part of the training program, a faculty member from each LU will \nspend three months at the counterpart overseas university, observing teacher-training programs \nin action. Through this process, it is expected that the best of international practice will be \nembedded in teacher training programs in Viet Nam, resulting in new pedagogical approaches \nbeing  adopted  by  teachers.  While  this  process  will  improve  course  design  and  teaching \nmethodologies within the LUs, each LU will, in turn, provide support to other TTIs by conducting \ntraining programs for staff and developing an improved curriculum. LUs need improved facilities \nand equipment to provide better quality of teaching with improved pedagogy. Under the Project, \neach LU will receive support for upgrading facilities and for additional key equipment. LU staff \nwill  also  receive  training  in  the  use  (and  maintenance)  of  enhanced  facilities  for  optimal \nimprovements in teaching methods.  \n \n27.  This component will have the following outputs: (i) 5,750 TTI lecturers will benefit from \n43 conferences and workshops provided to outline the new curriculum and approaches to \nteaching;  (ii)  MOET  will  issue  new  curriculum  guidelines  and  three  conferences  will  be \norganized to cover 300 key TTIs across the country to familiarize them with the guidelines; (iii) \n20 pedagogical courses will be developed conforming to new MOET guidelines; (iv) a new \napproach  for  supporting  first-year  teachers  will  be  developed  and  included  in  the  training \nprograms provided for DOET staff and principals; (v) following a series of small workshops to \ndevelop subject-specific accreditation criteria, 120 workshops will be conducted for 600 TTI key \nstaff to outline new accreditation processes; and 150 key TTI staff will be trained and accredited \nto teach the selected courses, which will result in all first-year trainee teachers undertaking \nindustry-accredited information technology training; and (vi) five TTIs will receive upgraded \nfacilities, equipment and staff fellowships for overseas training. \n \n \n \n ", "8   \nb.  In-Service Training  \n28.  Provide a National Program of In-Service Support for All US and PS Teachers. \nWhile MOET and the DOETs will retain their respective management role in the provision of \nprofessional  development  for  US  and  PS  teachers,  the  lead  universities  will  provide  the \nacademic support for improving in-service programs. With improved facilities and equipment, \nand with awareness of best instructional practice, they will model both content and method in \nthe in-service training courses they offer.  \n \n29.  Enhance Relevance of Content and Methods in All US and PS In-Service Training. \nAs with preservice programs, in-service courses need to support innovations in the school \ncurriculum. An audit process will be established under the Project to identify changes needed in \ncourse  content  and  design,  and  to  accommodate  school  curriculum  revisions.  MOET  will \ndevelop a permanent review process to monitor quality and, in particular, equity and gender \nissues  in  guidelines  designed  for  reviewing  current  in-service  training  courses.  Wherever \nappropriate, opportunities will be provided to industry to make inputs into curriculum, especially \nfor PS. \n \n30.  Develop Improved Training Programs for Teachers Working in US and PS Who Do \nNot  Meet  Professional  Requirements.  Among  the  many  teachers  who  do  not  meet \nprofessional requirements, approximately 3% of US and 17% of PS teachers are considered \nunderqualified. Training programs will be designed and provided for teachers who do not meet \nprofessional requirements to raise their competencies to desired levels. The new programs will \nbe aligned with the newly developed teacher profiles.  \n \n31.  These  interventions  will  result  in  the  following  outputs:  (i)  120  workshops  will  be \nconducted for 600 TTI key staff to outline new accreditation processes; (ii) 56 training programs \nfor 2,575 TTI staff and DOET officials will be provided to outline new approaches to in-service \ntraining programs and teacher support; (iii) new guidelines will be promulgated and used in \nthese  training  programs;  (iv)  400 principals  and  DOET  officials  will be  trained  in  the  new \naccreditation processes; and (v) 100 courses, each of 60 days, will be provided for 9,000 \nunderqualified or unqualified teachers. \n \n2.  Expand Access to US and PS Teacher Development  \n32.  Ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among US and PS teacher trainees, with \nonly 4% representation among US teachers given a population share of 13.7%.4 The Project \naims to remedy this by providing targeted support to ethnic minority groups, particularly women, \nto expand their access to teacher training programs. \n \n33.  Expand Physical Facilities of TTIs in Ethnic Minority Areas. Three regions have a \ndisproportionately higher representation of ethnic minorities: North West (79%), North East \n(41%), and Central Highlands (33%). They exceed the national figure of 13.7%. In each of these \nregions, the projected demand for additional teachers during 2005\u20132010 is significant, The \nNorth  West  needs  2,780  additional  teachers  or  68.2%;  the  North  East  needs  7,798  new \nteachers, or 47.4%; and the Central Highlands needs 5,927 new teachers, an increase of 79%. \nThe pressure on the TTIs to meet this projected demand is high. The Project will support six \nTTIs located in predominantly ethnic minority areas that cater significantly to students from \nethnic  minorities.  Of  these  six,  two  TTIs  train  US  teachers  and  four  TTIs  train  PS  and \n                                                 \n4  Exact figure for ethnic minority representation among PS teachers is not known.  \n ", "9 \ninterdisciplinary teachers. The Project will increase the capacity of, and upgrade facilities in, \nstudent dormitories to cater to increased enrollment of ethnic minority students, especially \nwomen;  increase  capacity  of  and  upgrade  facilities  in  student  canteens  supporting  the \ndormitories; and fund general improvements in facilities and equipment in selected TTIs. \n \n34.  Provide Scholarships to Ethnic Minority Students. Scholarships will be provided to \nethnic minority students to relocate for teacher training; at least 50% of these scholarships will \nbe awarded to girls from ethnic minorities.  \n \n35.  Improve Preparation and Bridging Courses. The quality of preparation courses needs \nto be improved to fill the gap between the skills acquired at school and the entry requirements of \nthe TTIs. The Project will provide inputs to help improve the content and design of the bridging \ncourses in the six universities identified for support to ethnic minority students to improve their \nacademic content to keep pace with the improvements in TTI curriculum. Improved bridging \ncourses  will  help  ethnic  minority  students\u2019  transition  to  a  more  challenging  academic \nenvironment. Upon completion of course design\u2014to the stage of accreditation\u2014the Project will \nsupport implementation of the recommended changes. \n36.  This  component  will  result  in  the  following  outputs:  (i)  six  TTIs  will  have  improved \nfacilities and upgraded equipment; (ii) additional dormitory space in three TTIs with enhanced \ncanteen facilities will be provided for students; (iii) 4,000 scholarships will be provided to ethnic \nminority students to train as US and PS teachers; and (iv) new preparatory curriculum will be \ndeveloped and 5,000 supporting workbooks developed and training provided to 450 TTI staff \nthrough three conferences for implementing the new preparatory curriculum.  \n \n3.  Strengthen Capacity for Planning, Management, and Delivery of Teacher \nTraining for US and PS \n \n37.  Develop a Comprehensive Framework for Teacher Development. Existing policies \nand procedures for teacher management and assessment systems need to be reviewed to \nensure that all aspects of teacher development, from initial selection and training to career-long \nin-service  training,  are  coordinated  and  complementary.  Currently,  the  policies  for  teacher \ndevelopment are disparate and no comprehensive teacher development plan is in place. The \nProject will help MOET review policies related to teacher education; and clarify, consolidate, and \nmodify these as necessary. Following the review, a comprehensive framework for teacher \neducation will be developed, supported by an implementation road map, which will address \nissues  of  preservice  qualifications,  recruitment,  deployment,  in-service  training,  career \ndevelopment, etc.  \n38.  Ensure Quality Assurance through Accreditation of Training Programs. A major \napproach to strengthening the quality of teacher training is through accreditation of all TTI \ncourses. The Accreditation Board established to accredit all higher education courses has only \ninvolved one TTI so far. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the Accreditation Board to \nexpedite accreditation processes so that all TTI courses offered for US and PS teacher training \nare accredited by content, design, time allocated, pedagogical implications, assessment, and \nstaff development. Only TTIs conducting accredited courses will be recognized in terms of \nproviding qualified teachers. This is necessary to reduce unacceptable differences in the quality \nof training provided. Specifically, the Project will strengthen capacity within the Accreditation \nBoard to accredit at least 10 TTI courses each year. MOET capacity will be strengthened to \ndevelop  the  criteria  and  standards,  as  well  as  assistance  with,  the  initial  accreditation  of \npreservice and in-service courses. An intensive training program will be conducted to assist \n ", "10  \nTTIs in redesigning their courses to meet accreditation requirements. Through a process of \nregular  reaccreditation,  courses  will  be  adapted  to  accommodate  new  knowledge  and \napproaches to teaching. To ensure course relevance to national and industry needs, the review \nand development of accreditation criteria and processes will be undertaken in consultation with \nstakeholders, including industry representatives.  \n \n39.  Strengthen Capacity for Education Planning and Management. MOET\u2019s ability for \neffective  planning  and  management  of  education  is  constrained  by  inadequate  information \nsystems that are not able to provide accurate and recent data to allow analysis of trends and \neffective  planning.  More  appropriate  and  sophisticated  databases  (segregated  by  gender, \nethnicity, location, etc. are needed to ensure quality, comprehensiveness, and consistency. The \nProject will (i) strengthen capacity by training MOET staff on data collection and analysis; (ii) \nstrengthen the education management information system (EMIS); and (iii) develop a teacher \nmanagement information system (TMIS) (Appendix 4). Activities include the following: \n \n(i)  Train  MOET  staff  on  data  analysis.  The  capacity  of  MOET  staff  will  be \nstrengthened for collecting and analyzing data to monitor emerging national and \ninternational trends, and provide MOET with policy options and advice. \n(ii)  Strengthen  the  EMIS.  With  the  development  of  expanded  and  improved \ndatabases, a better data management system and procedures are needed. To \nundertake this task, an integrated computer-based system will connect all DOET \noffices and 31 TTIs with MOET to enable data collection and analysis, including \nreporting against relevant performance indicators. This will allow current human \nresource management systems to be integrated, facilitating improved human \nresource processes.  \n(iii)  Develop  a  TMIS. While the annual statistical digest contains much valuable \ninformation, detailed information specific to US and PS teacher preservice and \nin-service training is more difficult to find and is located across a number of \ndepartments.  By  creating  a  TMIS,  relevant  and  rich  data  will  be  readily \naccessible. An improved interactive website with sufficient connectivity among all \n31 TTI sites and MOET and DOET offices will be established to allow for data \ncollection and analysis. TTI staff will receive training to manage the database. \n \n40.  Develop Teacher Profiles for Enhancing Teacher Performance. Education systems \nare recognizing the centrality of teacher performance in achieving high-quality outcomes for \nstudents. To better develop teacher effectiveness, a trend is to develop teacher profiles or \nstandards that identify what teachers need to know and be able to do in order to teach more \neffectively. This method is being piloted under the World Bank\u2019s Primary Teacher Development \nProject to reward excellence and identify the professional development needs of teachers. The \nProject will build upon this pilot and extend it to US and PS teachers. Profiles will outline four \nlevels of performance: beginner teacher, teacher, key teacher, and senior teacher to cover three \nkey areas: knowledge, skills, and attributes required to be highly effective teachers. These \nprofiles will be developed and piloted, with stakeholder consultations, in the nine provinces \nwhere the beneficiary TTIs are located. The profiles will form the basis of teacher reviews and \nbe used to determine the relative effectiveness of teachers. This will also facilitate the planning \nof appropriate in-service support for all teachers. The development of the profiles will result in \nimproved quality assurance, as all teachers will have to meet defined standards, including first-\nyear teachers who will be more effectively inducted into the teaching profession. Through \ncontinual renewal of registration every 5 years, teachers will be obliged to attend accredited in-\nservice  programs  to  update  their  knowledge  and  skills.  A  national  registration  system  for \nteachers will be developed. \n ", "11 \n \n41.  TTI-Industry Partnerships. Increasingly, industry is recognizing the benefits of TTI-\nindustry partnerships, which include the provision by industry of training programs licensed for \nTTIs  to  provide  to  students.  Students  who  complete  these  licensed  courses  gain  industry \naccreditation at various levels. This process ensures that trainee teachers are up-to-date in \nterms of industry knowledge and equipment. However, TTIs have indicated resource constraints \nfor supporting operational budgets for effective industry-TTI collaboration. To help overcome \nthis constraint, and to encourage greater use of industry-developed programs and systems, a \nsmall grant program will be piloted to encourage TTIs to forge partnerships with industry to \nprovide industry-accredited courses as part of teacher training programs. The grants will be \nprovided to those TTIs that are able to secure partnerships with the industry to offer industry \naccredited training courses. The grants are intended to be an incentive and may be used to \novercome  the  resource  constraint  for  meeting  counterpart  expenses  to  support  industry \naccredited  programs.  This  program  will  be  evaluated  annually  for  three  years  in  order  to \nmeasure the success of this innovation.  \n \n42.  This will result in the following outputs: (i) a comprehensive framework for teacher \neducation  with  a  supporting  implementation  road  map;  (ii)  new  accreditation  criteria \npromulgated and used to accredit all TTI pedagogical courses (10 courses will be accredited per \nyear during the Project); (iii) strengthened EMIS and TMIS systems, especially in relation to the \nregistration of teachers; (iv) network capacity connecting 31 TTIs with each other and with \nMOET; (v) an up-to-date website; (vi) standards of performance and profiles describing the \nskills, knowledge, and attributes of teachers at four levels developed and piloted; (vii) training \nprovided for 400 DOET officials and principals for use of new standards in all training programs; \n(viii) a national registration system for teachers; and (ix) 10 grants of $25,000 each will be \nprovided to 10 TTIs to forge partnerships with industry to deliver industry-accredited courses. \n \n4.  Improve  Facilities  to  Strengthen  Instructional  Capability  in  Teacher \nTraining Institutions5 \n \n43.  The aim of this component is to improve facilities, including upgrading equipment, in \nselected TTIs to support the goals of enhancing quality of training and expanding space to \naccommodate the additional demands for teacher development.  \n \n44.  Develop Five TTIs as Lead Universities. LUs need improved facilities and equipment \nto provide better quality of teaching with improved pedagogy. Under the Project, each LU will \nreceive support for upgrading facilities and for additional key equipment. LU staff will also \nreceive training in the use (and maintenance) of enhanced facilities for optimal improvements in \nteaching methods.  \n \n45.  Improve  Facilities  for  Teacher  Training.  The  Project  will  support  expanding  and \nupgrading of facilities to support improvements in the quality of education as well as to expand \ncapability for training in select TTIs. Eleven TTIs will receive support to improve their facilities, \nmodernize classrooms, and upgrade equipment. Each of the selected TTIs will be provided \nsupport for (i) expanding and modernizing teaching spaces in classrooms, laboratories, and \nworkshops  for  selected  existing  and  new  courses;  (ii)  acquiring  equipment  for  courses  as \nnecessary; (iii) upgrading library facilities; and (iv) providing short-term training in the use and \nmaintenance of new equipment and facilities.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Does not include the 5 TTIs covered under component 1 and  6 TTIs covered under component 2.  \n ", "12  \n46.  The component will have the following outputs: (i) 6 TTIs will have improved facilities \nand upgraded equipment, and (ii) 300 staff will be trained to use new equipment and improved \nfacilities in line with new approaches to teaching and learning. \nC.  Special Features  \n47.  The  Project  incorporates  a  number  of  distinctive  features  specifically  targeted  at \nproviding systemic support necessary for sustainable improvements in quality of US and PS \nteacher training.  \n \n48.  Capacity  Building.  The  Government  will  be  assisted  in  reviewing  current  teacher \ntraining guidelines and developing a comprehensive framework for teacher development with a \nsupporting implementation road map. Institutional capacity will be strengthened by applying the \naccreditation system to teacher training programs, and supporting MOET to create a system for \nregistration  of  teachers.  The  outlining  of  the  skills,  knowledge,  and  attributes  required  for \ndifferent levels of excellence among teachers, through creation of teacher profiles, will place \nViet Nam among the leading nations in innovative teacher development strategies. An improved \nEMIS,  to  include  a  TMIS,  will  be  developed  to  strengthen  planning  and  management  of \neducation in general, and teacher development in particular.  \n \n49.  Quality Improvement. The focus of the Project is on improving the quality of preservice \nand in-service teacher training. To ensure that the intended improvements occur, reconstructed \ntraining  programs  will  be  designed  and  regulatory  mechanisms  introduced  to  monitor \nimplementation. New initiatives to improve teacher quality include (i) a demonstrable alignment \nof training methods with declared national education goals; (ii) an accreditation process to \nensure quality of all training courses; (iii) registration processes for all teachers; (iv) formalized \nsupport programs for first-year teachers; and (v) international training partnerships to improve \nteacher  training  pedagogy,  producing  US  and  PS  students  with  nationally  needed  skills, \nknowledge, and creativity. \n \n50.  Information  Technology.  The  Project  promotes  basic  information  technology \ncompetencies  for  all  teachers;  all  teacher  trainees  will  be  certified  to  use  key  information \ntechnology programs and equipment. As technology\u2019s reach expands, teachers are expected to \nbe able to maximize the use of technology as a learning tool. \n \n51.  Improved Links with Industry. Through the expansion of industry-TTI partnerships and \nthrough industry involvement in accrediting selected teacher training courses to meet industry \nneeds, the relevance of US and PS to support national development goals will be enhanced.  \n \n52.  Social Targeting. To attract more teacher trainees from ethnic minority communities; \nimproved  bridging  programs  with  relevant  support  materials  will  be  offered;  student \naccommodation will be provided on selected campuses; and scholarships will be offered to \nethnic minority students, particularly girls, to pursue teaching as a career. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n53.  The project investment cost is estimated at $43.18 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, and taxes and duties (Table 1). The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  office  equipment,  consulting  services,  training, \nresearch, benefit monitoring and evaluation, and finance charges during construction, but will \n ", "13 \nexclude salaries of regular project staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties.

The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will finance 78.7% of \nthe  project  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  21.3%  of  $9.18  million  as \ncounterpart financing. The summary of the financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n Source  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  34.00  78.70 \nGovernment  9.18  21.30 \n    Total  43.18  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n55.  MOET will be the Executing Agency, and will have overall responsibility for project \ncoordination and implementation. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established within \nMOET  for  Project  implementation,  and  will  be  headed  by  a  Project  Director,  who  will  be \n ", "14  \nsupported by a deputy director, and six assistants.6 MOET will establish and ensure adequate \nstaffing of the PMU by loan effectiveness. The PMU Director will be responsible for reporting \nprogress of the project to the Minister/Vice-Minister on a regular basis. The PMU will have \noverall responsibility for project implementation including procurement, planning, budgeting, \nmonitoring,  coordination,  and  reporting.  Each  beneficiary  TTI  will  also  establish  Project \nImplementation Units (PIU). The PIUs will be headed by a member of the TTI\u2019s Governing Body \nwho will be assisted by three staff. The PIUs will be responsible for implementation of Project \nactivities in their respective TTIs and will submit quarterly progress reports to the PMU. Based \non  past  experience  in  implementing  education  sector  projects  in  Viet  Nam,  the  financial \nmanagement capability of the EA is assessed to be satisfactory. Project Management Cells \n(PMCs), headed by an official of DOET, maybe established in project provinces for coordinating \nproject activities at the provincial level. Each PMC will report on a quarterly basis to the PMU.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n56.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from June 2007 to June 2012. The \nGovernment has given assurance that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will be \nincluded in the 2006/07 fiscal year budget. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n57.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PMU,  in  close \ncooperation with relevant TTIs, will be responsible for all procurement.  NCB will be carried out \nensuring consistency with ADB's Procurement Guidelines.  Any necessary modifications or \nclarifications to the Borrower's procedures will be documented in the procurement plan and/or \nupdated procurement plan. A procurement plan is at Appendix 7.  \n \n58.  Equipment  and  Materials.  Supply  contracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $1  million \nequivalent or more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Supply \ncontracts for goods such as vehicles and computers (other than instructional materials) of less \nthan $1 million but more than $100,000 will follow national competitive bidding procedures. \nMinor items costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by shopping. Details of \nprocurement packages and technical specifications will be submitted for ADB approval before \nprocurement. MOET will take advance procurement action to expedite project implementation. \nADB\u2019s concurrence to advance action does not commit ADB to finance related expenditure \nunder the Project or to finance the Project.  \n \n59.  Civil Works. Project works comprise construction of (i) accommodation and canteen \nfacilities for an increased enrollment of trainees from ethnic minorities, particularly girls, at three \nTTIs; and (ii) enhanced instructional facilities and equipment (such as libraries, information \ntechnology,  laboratories,  and  technical  hardware)  as  identified  at  the  selected  TTIs.  The \nestimated cost is $5.5 million, including design and construction supervision. The works will be \nspread over 14 sites with at least one site in each region. All civil works will be carried out using \nnational competitive bidding procedures.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  In areas of finance and administration, procurement, construction and civil works, monitoring and evaluation, \nteacher pre-service and in-service curriculum, and quality and accreditation of teacher profiles. \n ", "15 \n4.  Consulting Services \n60.  A total input of 132 person-months of international consulting and 492 person-months of \nnational consulting is planned. The selection and engagement of consulting services to be \nfinanced under the Project will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The consultants responsible for project \nimplementation, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation will be selected and engaged on \nan individual basis. The selection and recruitment for the remaining services will be done \nthrough international firms using quality- and cost-based selection. The consulting services are \ndesigned to support the Project as well as build longer term capacity of the departments and \ninstitutions responsible for the formulation of policy, and management and delivery of preservice \nand in-service teacher training for US and PS. The consulting services cover broad areas of \nexpertise including (i) policy reform, (ii) teacher education preservice and in-service curriculum \nand  instructional  material  design,  (iii)  accreditation  procedures,  (iv)  teacher  registration \nprocedures, (v) data collection and analysis, (vi) information and communication technology \ncurriculum, (vii) EMIS development, and (viii) facilities and equipment improvement. Indicative \nterms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  8.  Detailed  Consulting  Inputs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n61.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) and policy relating \nto  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism. 7 Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the Government \nwill  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MOET and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n62.  In  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency the Government will be required to disclose information about various matters on \nthe Project, including procurement related to the Project, on MOET\u2019s website. With regard to \nprocurement, the website will include information on, among others, the list of participating \nbidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of \ncontract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured. Information regarding the criteria and \nprocedures for selection of candidates for scholarships will also be posted on the website. \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n63.  To expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB funds for eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank designated by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The imprest account \nwill be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019S  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). The imprest account ceiling and initial amount will not exceed \n$2,000,000. Statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n ", "16  \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the \nguidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE will not \nexceed the equivalent of $100,000. Auditors acceptable to the ADB will audit the use of the \nimprest account and SOE; a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE \nshould be included in the annual audit report.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n64.  MOET, on behalf of the Government, will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nProject to identify goods and services financed  from the loan proceeds. Project accounts, \nincluding financial statements, and SOE and imprest account records, will be audited annually \nby independent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provisions of the Loan \nAgreement.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies of  the certified  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on compliance with loan \ncovenants,  and  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under  ADB\u2019s  SOE  procedure  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. The independent \nexternal auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n65.  The PMU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB within 30 days of each quarter. The reports from the TTIs will be submitted to the PMU and \ncompiled  into  a  quarterly  report  to  be  submitted  to  MOET  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in English, in a format acceptable to ADB; and will indicate, among other matters, \nprogress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous quarter, \nsteps  taken  to  resolve  problems,  compliance  with  financial  loan  covenants,  and  proposed \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion of the Project, \nthe  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project \nimplementation, accomplishments, and impact. \n  8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.  MOET will monitor achievements in order to monitor and evaluate implementation and \ndevelopment impacts at various stages of the project cycle. Project performance monitoring will \nfocus on implementation plans and targets, and their fulfillment. Performance evaluations will \nexamine the impact of interventions, problems and constraints faced, the reason for them, and \ntheir solutions. The TTIs will be responsible for submitting semiannual monitoring reports to the \nPMU,  and  for  evaluation  visits  and  studies.  MOET  departments  will  be  responsible  for \nsubmitting the necessary information to be established as project monitoring indicators to the \nPMU as required for semiannual monitoring reports and annual evaluation studies.  \n9.  Project Review \n \n67.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify difficulties or constraints, and help \ndetermine ways to overcome problems that arise during implementation. Ensuing reports will be \nprepared and submitted to ADB and the Government. The PMU and TTIs will be the primary \ninformants for these reviews. ADB and the Government will conduct a midterm review to (i) \nreview the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) assess performance \nagainst  benchmarks  and  targets;  (iii)  review  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv) \nrecommend changes, if necessary, in project design or implementation. \n \n ", "17 \nIV.   PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n68.  The  Project  will  have  substantial  benefits  for  the  education  sector,  in  particular  for \nsecondary education. The systemic benefits to the sector will accrue from (i) a comprehensive \npolicy framework for teacher development; (ii) strengthening of the accreditation system to \nensure the quality of teacher training programs; (iii) a teacher registration system; (iv) improved \ncapacity for planning and management of education through the development of an EMIS and \nTMIS, including piloting a program for developing teacher profiles; (v) enhanced capacity of \ninstitutions responsible for training US and PS teachers; and (vi) overall improved quality of \nteachers.  \n \n69.  The secondary education subsector will benefit specifically from the Project. All TTIs will \nbenefit  from  improved  curriculum  and  pedagogy.  Seventeen  TTIs  will  receive  support  to \nmodernize and expand instructional facilities and equipment, so that in preservice and in-service \nprograms teachers are trained to provide improved quality secondary education, both in content \nand  methodology.  This  will  result  in  a  better  qualified  student  cohort  for  entering  higher \neducation, undertaking further training, or joining the workforce. The demand for better quality \neducation is created not only by Viet Nam\u2019s declared national development goals, but also by \nthe expanding economy and needs of industry, business, and the service sectors for more \ninformed and skilled workers. To develop the creative problem-solving skills demanded by \nemployers for international competitiveness, teaching practices will shift from a focus on rote \nlearning  to  active  student-centered  approaches,  preparing  them  to  add  value  to  the \neffectiveness of the businesses and organizations that subsequently employ them. To ensure \nthat  curriculum  revisions  adequately  reflect  the  diverse  demands,  the  Project  will  hold \nconsultations  with  stakeholders  such  as  industry,  teacher  groups,  potential  students,  and \ncommunity representatives wherever appropriate prior to curriculum revision. \n \n70.  The Project will lead to an improved, better managed, and more efficient teacher training \nsystem. By creating connectivity between institutions and establishing a standardized course \naccreditation process, efficiencies will result and synergies realized through the sharing of best \npractices. Efficiencies will also be achieved centrally as new management procedures are \ndeveloped that allow data, currently stored in many places and thus difficult to access, to be \nreorganized and made accessible through the establishment of an efficient EMIS. As with all \neducation systems, the loss of young teachers from the profession is a constant concern. This \nloss has many causes and is very costly, both economically and socially. Through the provision \nof a standardized high-quality support program for all first-year teachers, the resignation rate of \nbeginning teachers is expected to decrease.  \n \n71.  The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be current and future US and PS teachers who \nwill have continuing opportunities to improve their professional competencies through improved \npreservice  and  in-service  training  programs.  The  Project-initiated  improvement  in  their \nprofessional development will better ensure that all US and PS students are provided with a \nschool  experience  that  contributes  to  life  choice,  employability,  reduction  of  poverty,  and \nachievement of national development goals. The indirect beneficiaries will be current and future \nUS and PS students who will benefit from instruction from a better qualified teaching force. \n \n72.  Investments in education also have substantial benefits to society. Improved teaching \nquality leads to better education attainment, which in turn leads to higher human productivity, \ngreater employability, and overall better opportunities from higher incomes. As more students \n ", "18  \ncomplete  relevant  US  or  PS,  their  knowledge  and  skills  are  absorbed  by  the  community, \nincreasing  its  capacity  to  improve  social  conditions  for  all.  The  provision  of  highly  skilled \nteachers is central to the process of enhancing community skills and knowledge. An economic \nanalysis is attached as Appendix 9. \n \n73.  Through increased support for ethnic minority groups, particularly women, educational \nbenefits  will  accrue  to  these  communities  through  greater  educational  success  by  ethnic \nminority teachers. This will also serve as an incentive to increase the percentage of ethnic \nminority  students  to  complete  secondary  education.  Increased  access  for  ethnic  minority \nstudents will help reduce current disparities between ethnic minority groups and the general \npopulation, promoting greater social equity and cohesiveness. Four thousand ethnic minority \nstudents, at least half of whom will be women, will benefit directly through scholarships to \npursue teacher training. With increased education, income-earning capacity will rise and gains \nto society will accrue through improved indicators of social development. A social poverty \nimpact analysis is in Appendix 10, and a gender and ethnic minority development plan in \nAppendix 11.  \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguards  \n \n74.  The  Project  will  involve  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  existing  TTI  facilities,  with  no \nnegative environmental or resettlement impact. No land acquisition or resettlement is required. \nSome new classrooms will be added to existing TTIs, but on land already owned by the TTIs. \nC.  Risks  \n75.  The  Project  is  designed  in  support  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  and  high \npriority to improving education to achieve its economic goals. Therefore, the Government will \ncontinue to support efforts to improve the quality of education, of which teacher education is a \nkey concern. The Project was prepared with extensive consultations with government and TTIs, \nwhich agree on and support proposals contained in the Project. However, several areas of \nconcern could affect project performance and outputs. The risks identified occur within the \ncontext  where  the  size  and  scope  of  the  Project,  involving  31  TTIs  with  17  identified  for \nupgrading  of  facilities  including  five  for  improvement  as  lead  universities,  give  the  Project \nconsiderable  complexity  and  magnitude.  A  summary  of  risks  and mitigating  circumstances \nfollows. \n \n76.  Management Capacity. The major project risk emanates from the number of institutions \nto be supported by the Project by a combination of hardware and software inputs that will \nrequire considerable PMU management capacity to ensure project inputs within the time lines \nand resources outlined. The Project mitigates this risk by requiring that the PMU and beneficiary \nTTIs establish coordination committees to regularly monitor progress and take timely measures \nto address bottlenecks and delays. Experience indicates that weak management capacity can \nalso result in delays in the provision of software. The Project mitigates this risk by providing an \ninternational  expert  to  be  located  within  the  PMU  to  assist  with  project  management  and \nimplementation issues.  \n \n77.  Policy Formulation. Any faltering of commitment to review difficult and complex policy \nissues related to teacher development, including recruitment, deployment, standardization of \nqualifications,  and  career  development,  will  impact  policy  formulation.  However,  the \nGovernment is strongly committed to improving education quality, and supports the review of \nexisting policy statements and development of a comprehensive policy framework.  \n ", "19 \n78.  Sustainability.  Expansion  of  institutional  facilities  and  creation  of  information \nmanagement systems to support education and teacher management will require postproject \noperation and maintenance costs. Adequate budgetary provision will need to be made to ensure \nmaximization  of  benefits  through  properly  maintained  facilities  and  updated  databases. \nAdditional resources will be needed for periodic upgrading of training curriculum and in-service \ntraining, as determined by the policy review. The Project will generate continuing additional \nincremental costs of $1.5 million annually after the Project. A number of commitments, however, \nwill terminate at the end of the Project, and hence will not be an ongoing burden on the budget. \nThe most important ongoing financial commitments will be in meeting the base costs of annual \nsupplies, materials, power, etc. required to support the operation of the additional facilities and \nequipment provided under the loan, and their continuing maintenance expenses. Given the size \nof the annual operation and maintenance component of the education budget, of more than \n$250 million equivalent,8 the continuing liability would add less than 0.6% annually to the total. \nThis is feasible and sustainable, given the Government\u2019s commitment to educational expansion \nand development.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n(ii)  MOET will create a project website to disclose information about various matters \non the Project, including procurements related to the Project. With regard to \nprocurement, the website will include information on, among others, the list of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured. \n(iii)  In order to develop new curriculum content, pedagogical guidelines, and contract \nteaching  requirements  for  pedagogical  courses,  MOET  will  contract  with \nappropriate providers to develop the courses and will ensure that these courses \nare consistent with the guidelines developed and issued by MOET. \n(iv)  To ensure that women benefit equally from the Project, the Government and \nMOET will ensure that the Project is carried out in accordance with the gender \nstrategy contained in the Gender Action Plan that has been prepared and agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. Specifically, the Borrower and MOET will \nensure that under Component 2 (b), priority is given to girls from ethnic minorities \nwith the aim being that girls receive at least 50% of the scholarships. MOET will \ninclude in its annual reports to ADB details about information dissemination and \nany  other  efforts  being  made  to  achieve  a  50%  scholarship  ratio  for  ethnic \nminority girls. \n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  Project  is  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), in order to increase \nthe quality and access to US and PS teacher development received by the ethnic \n                                                 \n8  It was D3,889 billion in financial year 2002.  \n ", "20  \nminorities. In particular the Government will ensure that ethnic minorities receive \nall the benefits described under component 2 of the Project. \n(vi)  The sites, design, construction, and operation of TTI facilities upgrading and \nconstruction works undertaken under the Project will be implemented in line with \nthe Government\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002).  \n(vii)  The Government and MOET will ensure that the rehabilitation or construction of \nthe new TTI facilities will not involve involuntary resettlement according to ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). To be eligible for support the TTI will be \nrequired to confirm that no land acquisition or resettlement is required under the \nProject. Construction of new classrooms will be added to existing TTI facilities on \nunoccupied land already owned by the TTI. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n80.  The following condition will be met before the loan becomes effective: \n(i)  The Government will have established a PMU and will have appointed a project \ndirector,  a  deputy  project  director,  and  all  of  the  agreed  key  technical  and \naccounts and finance assistants.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n81.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,874,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Upper Secondary and Professional Teacher Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                             President \n24 November 2006 \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \nImpact:       \n      Assumption \nImproved quality of  \u2022  Successful  \u2022  Ministry of  \u2022  Government \nsecondary education   introduction of  Education and  commitment to \n  systemic  Training (MOET)  education remains \nimprovements aimed  reports  strong \nat improving quality   \nsuch as updating and  Risk \naccreditation of  \u2022  Government \ntraining courses,  commitment to \ndeveloping teacher  systemic change is \nprofiles and  weak \ninstitutional   \nstrengthening.  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nOutcome:       \n\u2022  Improved quality of  \u2022  31 Teacher Training  \u2022  MOET reports  \u2022  Government support \nupper secondary and  Institutions (TTIs)    remains strong \nprofessional secondary  benefit from improved  \u2022  EMIS/TMIS   \npre-service and in- curriculum and training    \u2022  Project management \nservice teacher training  of academic staff  \u2022  Impact  exhibits strong \n\u2022  Expanded access to  \u2022  5 TTIs are developed  assessment  leadership \nteacher training for  as lead universities  studies   \nethnic minority  with improved facilities    \u2022  Adequate financial \nstudents, particularly  and enhanced  \u2022  Project reports  resources are \ngirls.    capability for    committed to meet \n  pedagogical research    expansion and quality \nand innovation   goals \n\u2022  12 TTIs have improved   \nfacilities and updated  Risks \nequipment, including 6  \u2022  Weak project \nin ethnic minority  management and \ndominated areas.  cumbersome \n\u2022  4000 ethnic minority  procedures hamper \nstudents, including  decision making  \ngirls have opportunity  \u2022  Inadequate financing is \nto become US and PS  not provided to sustain \nteachers  quality \nOutputs    Assumptions \n1.

The national education and training system is all-encompassing, ranging from nursery \nschool to the highest doctoral programs, and from formal schooling and training to nonformal \nand continuing education. It comprises 5 years of primary; 4 years of lower secondary; and 3 or \n4 years when students attend either upper secondary (US) (3 years) or professional secondary \n(PS) (3 to 4 years), or attend separately run vocational training institutes for 1 to 3 years. \nEducation administration is shared by the central, provincial, and district governments, and \ncommunes, with central decision making and decentralized implementation. The great majority \nof  formal  education  and  training  is  publicly  provided  through  state\u2013run  schools,  colleges, \nuniversities, and training centers. However, a small number of nonpublic institutions operate, \nespecially schools and preschools. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall \nresponsibility for education and training, but while it manages higher education institutions, the \nprovinces manage US and PS schools; and cities, districts, and communes manage lower \nsecondary, primary, and preschool education. The Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs \nhas  specific  responsibilities  for  vocational  training.  This  pattern  is  not  uniform  across  the \ncountry, especially as the policy of promoting greater decentralization of management and fund-\nraising in the public sector takes effect. \n \n2.  During the last 10 years, the number of students enrolled in public schools has been \nincreasing.  Primary  education  is  nearly  universal,  with  a  net  enrollment  rate  at  97%.  The \nsecondary  participation  rate  is  rapidly  expanding  with  the  lower  secondary  education  rate \ntargeted  to  reach  90%  by  2010.  Two  strands  of  formal  education  available  after  lower \nsecondary,  US  and  PS,  are  usually  conducted  in  separate  schools  by  separately  trained \nteachers, and are managed by the provinces under the aegis of MOET. US is the much larger, \nacademically focused stream accounting for 86% of enrollments; while PS is more practical and \nvocationally  oriented  accounting  for  14%  (the  Government  is  taking  steps  to  increase  PS \nenrollment). Both can lead to university and college entry, and enrollments in both are growing rapidly.  \n \n3.  While enrollments in US and PS are increasing at much the same rate, the same cannot \nbe said for two key ingredients in their provision, namely, the number of schools and the number \nof teachers. In neither strand has the growth in the number of schools kept up with the increase \nin student enrollment. The number of US schools almost doubled during 1995/96 to 2003/04, \nthe number of PS schools in 2003/04 was almost the same as in 1995/96. Teacher numbers \nkept pace with student numbers in US, but grew only sluggishly in PS.  \n \n4.  The enrollment rate for US increased an average of 12% per year between 1995\u20131996 \nand 2003\u20132004, but is predicted to fall from a high of 14.61% in 2005 to 4.79% in 2010. For PS, \nincreases averaged 11% per year between 1995\u20131996 and 2003\u20132004, with a 4.9% increase in \n2005. Enrollments are projected to rise to 14.6% in 2010. Official figures indicate that enrollment \ntrends showed sharp increases in the latter half of the previous decade, but declined in the early \nyears of this decade; most of the growth since the mid 1990s has been in the US, PS, and \npostsecondary education subsectors. In fact the higher the level of education, the sharper the \nenrollment  increase;  this  is  partly  due  to  the  already  high  participation  rates  for  primary \neducation. For US and PS, these increases will require an additional 47,824 US teachers and \n10,594 PS teachers to be trained during 2005\u20132010, an approximately 44% increase in the \nnumber of teachers required if current student/teacher ratios are to be maintained (Table A2).  \n \n5.  Female teachers comprise 56% of US teachers and 45% of PS teachers, however no \navailable data breaks down this information by region and field of training. About 97% of US \nteachers are fully qualified, while only 83% of PS teachers are. Mountainous and remote areas \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nhave a shortage of qualified teachers. In highland areas, up to 50% of the teachers have been \nreported to be not fully trained. While ethnic minorities make up 13.75% of the population, only \n3.5% of US teachers are from an ethnic minority. No data is available for PS. \n \n6.  US and PS enrollments are unevenly distributed by household income, ethnic group, \nand urban or rural area. A gap exists between Kinh and Chinese residents groups and ethnic \nminority groups in school enrollment, with the enrollment rates of 45.2% and 19.3%. Children \nfrom the poorest quintile are enrolled at the rate of only a quarter of the richest quintile. Girls \nand boys in rural areas, where most ethnic minority groups live, are less likely to attend school \nthan those in urban areas. The reasons for different enrollment rates include the direct cost and \nopportunity  cost,  low  parental  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  long-term  investment  in  child \neducation, and sociocultural obstacles especially the practice of old customs including the early \nmarriage of girls.  \n \n7.  Enrollment of ethnic minority students has risen sharply, increasing by 60% from 1999 to \n2004.  However,  they  still  remain  underrepresented  at  9.4%  of  total  enrollments  against  a \npopulation share of 13.7%. Several measures are continuously being applied to facilitate the \naccess  of ethnic  minorities  to  higher  education,  including  preparation  in  boarding  schools, \nadmission without entrance examinations, lower standards to pass the examinations, offers of \nscholarships, and waiving of tuition fees. Attention is also being given to improving female \nstudents\u2019 enrollment rates although the gender gap in US enrollments is not significant. \n \n8.  Steady economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.5% in \nthe last decade, and the Government\u2019s strong commitment to education have resulted in public \nexpenditure on education claiming a higher percentage of GDP (increased from 3.5% in 1996 to \nan estimated 4.6% in 2004) than any other country in the region except Malaysia and Thailand. \nExpansion of education can also be gauged from the annual increases of over 19% in wages \nand salaries compared with less than 13% annual growth for the pubic sector as a whole. A \ngreater proportion of the education budget goes to capital expenditure for US and PS than on \nother subsectors. The majority of funds available for teacher training are public funds, with little \nprovided by the private sector. Education is still very centralized, with teacher training the most \nhighly centralized subsector.  \n \n9.  Quality of education remains a serious concern, particularly in remote and mountainous \nregions.  Surveys  conducted  by  funding  agencies  indicate  the  following  causes:  (i)  limited \ninfrastructure, (ii) inaccessibility, (iii) language and culture barriers, (iv) lack of adequate number \nof qualified teachers, and (v) the perception that returns to education are low. Lack of well-\neducated youth among ethnic minorities has direct implications not only for poverty reduction \nthrough lack of employability but also for social issues such as population, health care, human \nresources for local governance, and other community development issues. The Government \nrecognizes the need to upgrade the quality of education and increase access for both males \nand females to achieve the development objective of increasing the proportion of the labor force \nthat is skilled and trained to 30% by 2005, and to 40% by 2010. In addition professional training \nfor youth in rural areas needs to be intensified. The Education Development Strategic Plan for \n2001\u20132010  specifically  refers  to  the  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  by  fostering \ninnovative  teaching  methods.  The  plan  also  refers  to  the  need  for  quality  assurance  by \nstrengthening the accreditation system. The Project supports the major suggestions contained \nin the plan for improving the quality of US and PS by improving the quality of teachers.

The Project aims to help reduce poverty in Viet Nam by improving the quality of upper \nsecondary (US) and professional secondary (PS) education by (i) improving the quality of US \nand PS preservice and in-service teacher training; (ii) expanding access for ethnic minorities, \nparticularly women, to US and PS teacher development; (iii) strengthening capacity for planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of teacher training for US and PS education; and (iv) improving \nfacilities to strengthen instructional capability in teacher training institutions. The Project will (i) \nenhance training quality, efficiency, access and equity, and management; (ii) help strengthen \nthe national teacher development system to integrate preservice and in-service training; and (iii) \nprovide targeted support to teacher training institutes (TTIs) in ethnic minority areas; ethnic \nminority students, particularly women; and TTIs in areas of rapid economic growth.  \n \nA.  Economic Justification \n \n2.  The project goal is to improve the quality of teacher training for US and PS teacher \ndevelopment, which will lead to improvements in the quality of US and PS. Improvements in the \nquality of education are likely to produce a better educated and more productive work force; and \nlead to greater demand for education, thereby increasing the number of employable educated \npeople. Better skills will lead to higher incomes, which in turn will lead to greater consumption, \nleading to greater demand for goods. It will also result in greater investments in family welfare \nthrough enhanced access to education and health. The latter will have an intergenerational \nimpact through a continuous process of improvements in human resources. \n \n3.  Economic benefits will also accrue from efficiency and productivity gains as a result of \nproject inputs. The Project will result in a modernized teacher training curriculum, and improved \nteaching methodologies. About 220,000 student teachers are expected to benefit from improved \ntraining  curriculum  and  pedagogy  during  the  Project.  Since  curriculum  changes  and \nimprovements in pedagogy extend beyond the life of the Project as does enhanced capacity of \nthe  TTIs  through  staff  development  and  periodic  accreditation  requirements  for  training \nprograms, benefits will continue to accrue to future students of TTIs as well. With improved \nteaching, retention rates will increase and dropout rates, already low, will fall, resulting in a \ngreater number in the population having more employable skills. In addition, knowledge and \nskills transfer will be more effective, leading to increased learning and, subsequently, better \nacademic performance. Improved skills and knowledge will lead to higher productivity and \nincreased economic competitiveness. The plan for improved support for first-year teachers will \nincrease retention rates of graduate teachers, which translates to lower future hiring and training \ncosts. In addition, this impacts the quality and effectiveness of teaching.  \n \nB.  Project Beneficiaries \n \n4.  Project  beneficiaries  can  be  categorized  as  those  who  stand  to  gain  directly  and \nimmediately  from  the  project  interventions;  and  those  who  benefit  in  a  less  direct,  but \nnonetheless substantial, manner. \n \n5.  Direct Beneficiaries. These include  \n  \n(i)  academic staff and management of the TTIs: (a) at all 31 TTIs through the \nactivities under component 1; and (b) at the 17 participating project TTIs through \nfacilities support provided under components 2 and 4; \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \n(ii)  approximately 220,000 potential student teachers over 5 years attending US and \nPS training courses at TTIs, through activities designed to improve preservice \ncourses, under components 1, 2, and 4; \n(iii)  approximately 120,000 current US and PS teachers, of which 4,500 are from \nethnic minorities, through activities designed to improve in-service courses at \nTTIs, under components 1, 2, and 4; \n(iv)  4,000 students from ethnic minorities, at least half of whom are expected to be \nwomen, through the activities designed to improve access to teacher training \nunder component 2; and \n(v)  teacher training system administrators in MOET, through activities conducted \nand support provided under component 3 to strengthen their capacity to plan, \nmanage, administer, and regulate the system. \n \n6.  Indirect Beneficiaries. These include  \n \n(i)  students in US and PS schools, both currently and in the future, through being \ntaught by better trained and motivated teachers: (a) lower repeat and dropout \nrates; and (b) more relevant and employable attitudes, skills, and knowledge; \n(ii)  employers  and  potential  employers:  (a)  recruits  with  more  relevant  and \nemployable attitudes, skills, and knowledge; (b) less need for costly initial training \nof recruits and/or greater returns from what they undertake; \n(iii)  higher education institutions: better prepared applicants, lower first-year failure \nrates, and less need for costly bridging courses; \n(iv)  Government treasury: lower repeat and dropout rates in TTIs and in US and PS \nmean  more  effective  use  of  scarce  public  funding  directed  at  the  education \nsector. \n \n7.  Benefits of the reforms and quality improvements in US and PS teacher training will also \nextend to a population of US and PS school students that is already almost 3.3 million strong \nand growing rapidly. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impact \n \n8.  The social benefits from the poverty reduction effect of the Project will be significant. \nApproximately 29.1% of project costs are aimed directly at increasing enrollment and improving \nretention rates for ethnic minority students. The increase in ethnic minority students, particularly \nethnic minority women, training as teachers through the provision of increased accommodation \nto support scholarship recipients will help overcome current disparities between ethnic minority \ngroups and the general population. The provision of new preparatory course curriculum for \nethnic minority students and the training of staff for an increased understanding of the issues \nand challenges faced by ethnic communities will provide social benefit as more TTI staff as well \nas teacher trainees will have an appreciation of the needs of disadvantaged groups and adopt \nmore effective pedagogy within an improved curriculum. Six TTIs located in predominantly \nethnic  minority  areas  will  receive  support  for  enhanced  facilities  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding, leading to long-term, sustained benefits for ethnic minority populations with benefits \nthat will extend far beyond the project cycle. Also, as more students complete relevant US or \nPS, their knowledge and skills are absorbed by the community\u2014increasing its capacity both \nnationally and locally to improve social awareness of important development issues of direct \nrelevance to communities, such as environmental conservation, health, sanitation, and hygiene. \nThe provision of highly skilled teachers is central to the process of enhancing community skills \nand knowledge.  \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \n \n9.  Social benefits from investments in secondary education are high. A better educated \npopulation, particularly women, leads to multiple, intergenerational benefits to society: \n \n(i)  As education levels rise, people tend to have fewer children leading to slower \npopulation growth. \n(ii)  Educated parents tend to place greater value on education, investing a higher \nproportion of resources in the education of their own children. \n(iii)  Educated  women  avail  of  access  to  health  services  more  than  their  lesser \neducated counterparts leading to improved family health. \n(iv)  Women\u2019s  education  is  directly  correlated  with  improved  nutritional  standards \nwithin households. \n(v)  Educated mothers not only allocate more household resources to education and \nhealth,  but  also  reduce  gender  disparities  in  intrahousehold  allocation  of \nresources.  \n \nD.  Financial Sustainability  \n \n10.  The Project will generate continuing additional incremental cost of $1.5 million annually \nafter the Project. Table A9.1 indicates the estimated level and category of the annual financial \ncommitments required of the Government over the life of the Project. Expenditures peak in \nyears 2 and 3 at around $2.8 million, and thereafter settle at approximately $1.5 million per \nannum. A number of these commitments, however, will terminate at the end of the Project, and \nhence will not be an ongoing burden on the budget. The most important ongoing financial \ncommitments  will  be  in  meeting  the  base  costs  of  annual  supplies, materials,  power,  etc. \nrequired to support the operation of the additional facilities and equipment provided under the \nloan, and their continuing maintenance expenses. Given the size of the annual operation and \nmaintenance  component  of  the  education  budget,  of  over  $250  million  equivalent,3 the \ncontinuing liability will add less than 0.6% annually to the total. This is feasible and sustainable \ngiven the Government\u2019s commitment to educational expansion and development. Moreover, \nsome  project  gains,  particularly  those  that  strengthen  capacity;  improve  the  curriculum, \nclassroom assessment, and examination; and improve teacher competencies; will have long-\nterm beneficial impact and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. Government \nexpenditures on education have risen steadily (Table A9.2).  \n                                                 \n3  It was D3,889 billion in financial year 2002. \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nTable A9.1: Government Financial Contributions to the Proposed Project \n \nAnnual Contribution ($)\nTotal\nItem Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nA.

Concerns continue over the capacity of some households to pay school fees. However, \nwith increased economic activity and targeted Government support for the poor, the increases in \nschool enrolment are expected to be sustained. Fiscal impact analyses were conducted to \ndetermine the effect of project costs on Government budgets, and the projected costs have \nbeen built into future Government budget projections. Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \nhas grown rapidly in recent years, and the size of the Government\u2019s budget has grown with it. \nTable A9.2 shows that public expenditure has maintained its share of GDP over the last decade. \nAt  the  same  time,  however,  the  share  of  public  spending  on  education  and  training  has \nincreased, from 14% in 1994 to just over 17% 10 years later, and this in turn has meant that its \nshare  of  GDP  has  increased  a  whole  percentage  point.  This  meant  that  by  2002  public \nexpenditure on education and training in Viet Nam claimed a higher percentage of GDP than in \nany  other  country  in  Southeast  Asia  except  Malaysia  and  Thailand.  This  increase  in \nGovernment  commitment  to  education  provides  evidence  that  the  planned  improvements \nassociated with the Project will be supported and sustained over time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \n \n \nTable A9.2: Total Public Expenditure, and Expenditure on Education and Training \n(as a percentage of GDP) \n \nPercent  1994  1998  2000  2002  2004 est. \nPublic expenditure share of GDP  25.1  20.3  23.4  24.9  26.9 \nPublic expenditure on education \n3.5  3.5  3.5  4.2  4.6 \nand training share of GDP \nEducation and training share of  14.\n17.4  15.1  16.9  17.1 \npublic expenditure  0 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources:  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2004.

No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nIn Viet Nam, upper secondary (US) and professional secondary (PS) education are contributing significantly to \nachieving many of the Government\u2019s development objectives contained in the Education Development Strategic Plan \nfor 2001\u20132010. These objectives are consistent with those outlined in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy and program update 2000\u20132006 for Viet Nam. The education goals and objectives include \n\u2022  contributing  to  and  maintaining  economic  growth,  and  reducing  the  poverty  rate  through  increased \nemployment and job creation;  \n\u2022  increasing labor time use and productivity; and \n\u2022  achieving universal lower secondary education for the entire population and improving education quality for \nall at all education and training levels, with particular attention to poor and ethnic minority student group \nneeds. \n(Source: Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, 2002; Ministry of Education and Training [MOET], 2001; National Committee \nfor Advancement of Women in Vietnam, 2000; Education Development Strategy and policy measures, MOET, 2001, \n2003) \n \nThe labor market is characterized by a clear shortage of qualified workers. The need for improved access to higher \neducation and professional training for young women and men, especially in rural and mountainous areas, is strong. \nThe average percentage of workers who have finished US is still very low (18.4%) with the rate of females (17.3%) \nbeing lower than that of males (19.5%). The five geographic regions of the North East, Central Highlands, South \nCentral Coast, South East, and Mekong River Delta, have a US completion rate that is less than half that of some \nother regions. \n \nThe average percentage of the labor force with professional certificates and vocational skills is also low at 3.9% \n(females at 4.2% and males 3.3%), especially for the Mekong River Delta, North West, South East, and South Central \ncoast. (Source: Survey Results on Jobs and Labor Situation, Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, 7/2002; \nCentral Institute for Economic Management [CIEM], 2003.).  \n \nIn the current professional training structure, only 1.0% of current workers are university graduates and 2.7% have \ntechnical certificates. This is much lower than the national goal of 10% for graduates and 15% for those with technical \ncertificates.  \n \nIn the agriculture sector, where 17 million workers are currently employed, the proportion of local agricultural senior \nmanagement staff with a PS degree is low at 27.7%; 34.5% have a vocational training certificate, which does not meet \nthe sector development needs (Nguyen Thi Tuoc 2003). Within the professional and management levels of the rural \nworking population, only 3.9% have access to PS, and the percentage of working people with a university degree is \nvery low. \n \nIn the highlands and mountainous areas, the education level and trained skills of workers is much lower. The \ncorrelation between ethnicity and lack of educational opportunities is high with the number of ethnic minority students \ncompleting schooling well below that of nonethnic minorities. US and PS teachers from ethnic minority groups \ncomprise only 4% of the teacher population compared with an expected 14%. \n \nDuring the last decade, the net enrollment rate for US increased by an average of 12% per year with the average rate \nof graduates from US schools being 89.9%. The Government\u2019s target participation of US school-age children is 45% \nby 2005 and 50% by 2010; recent data indicates that these targets are being met and even exceeded.  \n \nPS (vocational) has been expanding but faces a number of challenges in meeting the requirements of a growing labor \nmarket and development goals. PS needs to be strengthened to address the national development plan\u2019s skilled labor \nneeds. A better balance is needed between US and PS. Improvements are needed for professional training structures \nand access for rural and poor students to training institutions and PS schools in both urbanized higher growth areas, \nas well as in rural and mountainous areas, especially for students from ethnic minorities. The general target set is by \n2005, 10% of the vocational age population will participate in vocational training schools, rising to 15% by 2010. This \nwill require a transition from lower secondary schools to vocational schools to reach 10% in 2005 increasing to 15% in \n ", "50  Appendix 10         \n \n2010. High-skill vocational programs and the planned building of additional PS schools has meant that the 2005 target \nhas been met and budget projections for increased teacher numbers will allow slightly more than 15% of senior \nsecondary students to study in vocational schools by 2010. While PS provision will continue to expand at an average \nrate of 15% over the next 5 years, the expansion rate for US enrollments will slow to an average of 8% over the same \nperiod. This will adjust the balance between US and PS education so that more students will have access to \nvocationally focused programs.  \n \nThe need to upgrade the quantity and quality of the educational system is widely recognized, and to increase access \nfor both male and female students to achieve the Government\u2019s development objectives and targets. The Project will \naddress these concerns through increased support and improvement to the preservice and in-service teaching \nprograms, improved capacity and facilities in some teacher training universities, and improved management of \nprograms by MOET and department of education and training offices. The Project has a very strong focus on \nuniversities in remote locations, which will receive support to increase and improve facilities so that poorer students \nhave improved opportunities to train as US and PS teachers. While much of the focus will be in support of ethnic \nminority students, the correlation between these groups and poverty is high, and as such, the Project will focus \nsignificant resources to addressing this issue. The Project will promote and apply active measures leading to more \nequal access to both US and PS for girls/women and boys/men, and take into account the special needs of training \nboth female and male students to be teachers and lecturers, especially the target groups of poor and ethnic minority \ngroups. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n                                                                                          \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPopulation and Labor Force. Viet Nam has a population of approximately 83 million (2005), with an expected \naverage annual growth rate of around 1.1% over the next decade. In 2003, 31% of the population was under the age \nof 15 and significant percent was in the working age from 15\u201364 years. The urban population accounts for 25.8% with \nan average growth rate of 4.2%, and rural growth accounts for 74.2% with an annual growth rate of 0.6%. Agriculture \nis still the major employer in the economy, accounting for 67% of the total labor force in 2001 (Source; General \nStatistics Office, Hanoi at www.GSO.gov.vn). Viet Nam has undergone rapid economic development and growth over \nthe last decade. The gross domestic product (GDP) has improved with an average GDP per capita in 1999 of $360, \nrising to $480 in 2003.  \n \nThe human development situation varies considerately across the country (Source: National Center for Social \nsciences and Human sciences of Viet Nam, 2001, ADB, 2001), with large inequalities in the degree of industrialization, \nwhich are reflected and pronounced on a per capita basis (Source: GSO, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, \n2002). The gap of inequality in income per capita seems to be widening between urban and rural areas. Income \ndisparities have been widening also between regions and ethnic groups with the most vulnerable groups including \nethnic minorities, the rural poor, and unregistered migrants in urban areas.  \n \nPoverty: From 5%\u201310% of the population is estimated to still be vulnerable to falling into poverty. (Source: Poverty \nTask Forces, 2002).The poverty distribution is uneven across geographic regions and areas. In rural areas, in 2002 \nthe average rate of poverty was very high at 35.6%, while the rate of urban poverty was much lower at 6.6%. In rural \nareas, poverty and the vulnerability of falling into poverty are more pronounced. This is especially true for some \nremote, disaster-prone mountainous regions that have a high concentration of ethnic minority groups such as the \nnorthern mountains, especially the North West, Central Highlands, North Central Coast, and South Central Coast \nregions.  \n \nThe two main better-off urban areas, the Red River Delta and South East regions while having high growth also have \nhigh poverty densities as a result of increased urbanization. In the rural areas of the North West and North Central \nCoast, poverty density is lower because of the relatively smaller populations. The challenge is to provide appropriate \nsupport for the poor, both in large cities and rural and mountainous areas.  \n \nEthnic Minority Group Incidence of Poverty. In Viet Nam, 53 ethnic minority groups make up 13.8% of the total \npopulation. Their situation is complex as many groups are small in number and often confined to a specified location. \nEthnic minority group concentration in each region varies considerably. In the North West, North Central Coast, \nCentral Highlands, and South Central Coast regions, where ethnic minority groups are more concentrated, the poverty \nrate and vulnerability are highest. The rate of poverty among ethnic minority group households is 69.3% higher than in \nother social groups such as the Kinh and those of Chinese origin where the poverty level is 23.1%. For Kinh and \nChinese groups, the poverty gap is 4.7%, while for the other ethnic minorities it is 22.8% (Source: GSO, 2002). Ethnic \nminority groups also have varying levels of deprivation and food poverty. The poverty among them is reducing at a \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \nslower rate than with the general population (ADB 2004), and the share of ethnic minorities among the poor has \nincreased from 20% (1993) to 30% (2002), with a recent forecast that this share could go as high as 37% by 2010 \nusing a new poverty standard index.  \n \nThese trends present a major challenge for the country. A statistical forecast of the poverty rate by 2010 indicates that \nethnic minorities will be the hard core of poverty in Viet Nam. (VDR 2004). \n \nPoverty among ethnic minority groups is closely associated with low or limited access to education and training \nopportunities. The quality of education is a wide social concern, but is a particular concern in remote and ethnic \nminority mountainous areas. The main reasons are lack of infrastructure, inaccessibility, language and cultural \nbarriers, lack or limited quality of teachers, curricula that are not suitable to localities, perceptions that returns from \neducation are low, and low household affordability (United Nations Development Program and Partnership for \nTransparency Fund 2002, Department for International Development and Partnership Transparency Fund 2002, \nVietnam Development Report 2004). Distance becomes an important factor in relation to access to US and PS for the \nrural poor and for providing opportunities for the rural poor to train as teachers. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender issues: All geographic regions are characterized by a gender imbalance and disparate trends in both \naccessing senior secondary education and training opportunities especially in specialized fields. Females have a lower \nincidence of schooling than males, and people in rural areas have lower completion rates than in urban areas. Of \nstudents completing schooling, ethnic minority students, especially females, are still underrepresented.  \n \nAmong females workers 17.3% have completed US, 15.2% have a professional or technical qualification, and 3.9% \nhave a college diploma or university degree. This compares with males with 19.5%, 20.6%, and 4.5% respectively. \nThe rates are lowest in the North West, North East, Mekong River Delta, and Central Highlands (Source: Survey \nresults on job and labor situation, Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, 7/2002; CIEM 2003). \n \nThe issue in relation to the rate of female participation in teacher training indicates that appropriate numbers of women \nare teachers, but a significantly lower number of women teach in universities and women are less represented in \ncertain fields of teaching specializations. In relation to teacher training, a very small number of US and PS teacher \ntrainees are from ethnic minority groups. Equity and gender equality issues need to be better integrated and \naddressed, especially ethnic minority issues, in official education and training policies, teacher training program \ndevelopment, and project activities.  \n \nThe Project will positively contribute to meeting these needs through a range of targeted activities and improvements \nto central policies and practices. The Project will support selected US and PS teacher training institutes (TTIs) in all \ngeographic regions throughout Viet Nam, concentrating on TTIs in the most isolated regions. Specific activities and \nprograms will be targeted at the integration of gender issues and equity concerns into the programs conducted by all \nproject universities. Training curriculum review will specifically ensure that gender issues are fully captured in the \ntraining. Specific activities include the need to effectively address gender and ethnic minority education concerns as \nkey issues that must be positively addressed as part of the accreditation process for all preservice and in-service \ncourses; the provision of scholarships to allow poor ethnic minority students to train as teachers; the building of \nadditional  student  dormitories  targeted  for  ethnic  minority  students,  particularly  women;  and  the  review  and \nstrengthening of bridging courses for ethnic minority students and targeted staff training. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher  Development  Project  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s development goals by improving the quality of secondary education through \nextensive support for teacher education for both general upper secondary (US) and professional \nsecondary  (PS)  levels.  The  Project  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  producing  a  better \nqualified and more productive work force. The Project aims to (i) improve the quality of US and \nPS  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training;  (ii)  expand  access  to  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment;  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of  teacher \ntraining for US and PS; and (iv) improve facilities to strengthen instructional capability in teacher \ntraining institutes. The Project will enhance training quality, efficiency, access and equity, and \nmanagement. The gender action plan (GAP) supports the project objectives, and highlights \nspecific actions that will be integrated during implementation. Specific targets will be developed \nfurther at the start of the Project. The GAP was prepared according to Viet Nam regulations and \neducation guidelines, and in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Policy on \nGender and Development (1998). While the Project provides targeted support to increasing \nparticipation of ethnic minority groups, some additional actions are reflected in the GAP in \naccordance to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).   \n \nA.  Background \n2.  Secondary education is divided into two subsectors: (i) US provides general education; \nand (ii) PS education has a major focus on technical and vocational training. Appendix 11 \nincludes  a  gender  analysis  and  Table  A11.1  provides  an  overview  of  ethnic  and  female \nrepresentation.  \nTable A11.1: Female and Ethnic Representation in Upper Secondary  \nand Professional Secondary Education \nSpecifics  Upper Secondary  Professional Secondary \nFocus  General education with focus  Technical and vocational \non higher education  training \nStudent/teacher ratio  About 26 to 1  About 33.5 to 1 \nNet enrollment rate (NER) (1993\u20132005)  From 18.7% to 51% \nIncrease in NER   12.9%  11.0% \nGirls NER  48.2%  55.0% \nEthnic minorities NER  9.4%  4.2% \nDistribution of students  85.7%  14.3%  \nDistribution of schools  85.7%  14.3% \nDistribution of teachers  88.4%  11.6% \nFemale teachers  56.1%  45.0% \nEthnic minority teachers  3.5%   \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance consultant estimates. \n \n3.  The Project responds to the growing and project net enrollment rates of students in US \nand PS. The social benefits from investments in secondary education, especially for females, \nlead to multiple and intergenerational benefits to society (Appendix 9). \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nB.  Legal  Framework  for  Achieving  Gender  Balance  in  Education  Development  in \nDisadvantaged Areas \n4.  The Government supports conditions, guidelines, and policies for promoting social equity \nand gender equality, and prioritized programs for ethnic minority development to ensure the \npreservation of their diverse cultural identities and languages. The legal framework for ensuring \nequity and gender equality, including access to education and training, is well integrated. For \ninstance,  see  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  2001\u20132010; \nEducation  Development  Strategy,  2001\u20132010  (Ministry  of  Education  and  Training,  2001); \nEducation for All Plan, 2003; National Strategy for Women Advancement to 2010 (NCFAWS, \n2002); Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010; and draft Gender Equality \nLaw (currently being considered by the National Assembly, 2006). \n5.  The  development  objectives  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nStrategy  include  (i)  achieving  better  education  for  all,  (ii)  ensuring  gender  equality  and \nempowerment  of  women,  (iii)  reducing  vulnerability,  and  (iv)  eradicating  poverty  while \npreserving the cultural identity of ethnic minority groups. The strategy considers implementation \nof the education plan \u201cwith equity and higher quality for all, especially for ethnic minority groups\u201d \nas one of the most important concerns and decisive factors for poverty reduction.  \n6.  The Strategy for Education Development for 2001\u20132010 includes special measures for \npromoting equity, and addressing gender and ethnic minority issues in education and training, \nsuch as (i) apply measures for reducing the gender gap in access to education and training; (ii) \nwork out special incentives for encouraging more women and girls in remote, rural, and ethnic \nminority  areas  to  attend  schools;  and  increase  percentage  of  female  students  in  upper \neducation boarding schools; and (iii) overcome gender bias and stereotypes in school textbooks \nto promote more equal opportunities in education and training.  \n7.  In achieving the goal of implementing gender equality, women\u2019s advancement, and \nchildren\u2019s rights and protection within the education and training sector, especially for ethnic \nminority  groups,  the  following  objectives  are  clearly  stated:  (i)  implement  successfully  the \nNational Strategy for Women Advancement to 2010; (ii) find the measures for ensuring women\u2019s \nequal access to education, training, and in-service professional skills upgrading; (iii) apply \nincentives to encourage female students in remote rural areas, especially for ethnic minority \nfemales in US, in boarding schools, colleges, and universities; apply supporting policies for poor \nwomen/girls in education and training; (iv) include measures for readjusting and overcoming \nsex-disaggregated trends in the field of training and education, integrating gender issues into \nthe professional orientation programs and training; and review and improve quality of schools \ntextbooks and get rid of old gender perceptions, bias, and stereotypes; (v) apply measures for \nincreasing the number of female managers and women in leadership positions in all education \nlevels; (vi) create education promotion funds for females, and define the female targets to be \nachieved in all education and training levels and retraining and upgrading skills courses; and \n(vii) strengthen the education, propaganda, and social advocacy for raising awareness and \nresponsibilities of state agencies, institutions, households, and individuals for promoting gender \nequality.  \nC.
