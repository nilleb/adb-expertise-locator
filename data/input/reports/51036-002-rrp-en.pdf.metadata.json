I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cities \nImprovement Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to be \nprovided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cities \nImprovement Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2.  The project will support provincial and city governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province \n(KPK) in improving the livability of five cities1 by (i) expanding physical investments in urban water, \nsewerage,  solid  waste  disposal,  and  climate-resilient  infrastructure;  and  (ii) strengthening \ninstitutional capacity in services delivery, mainstreaming gender equality, and improving the \nperformance of municipal companies. The project will benefit up to 3.5 million people. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. KPK is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan, located about \n130  kilometers  (km)  northwest  of  Islamabad,  the  country\u2019s  capital,  sharing  a  border  with \nAfghanistan. In 2000\u20132017, KPK accounted for about 11% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product \nand had the fastest annual economic growth rate\u2014about 5%\u2014among the four provinces.2 KPK \nhas a population of about 32 million which is expected to increase to about 58 million by 2035.3 \nBy the same year, it is also projected that 35% of KPK\u2019s population will be concentrated in cities, \nup from 16% in 2017 (footnote 3). KPK\u2019s rapid urban population growth rate (about 3.4% per \nannum) is placing a tremendous strain on its cities. Inadequate infrastructure and limited capacity \nto  manage  municipal  water,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  services  are  further  exposing  the \npopulation to health risks and making the cities more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.4 \n \n4.  Issues. Supply of basic urban services such as water supply, wastewater collection and \ntreatment, solid waste management (SWM), and green urban spaces (e.g., parks) has failed to \nmeet increasing urban domestic and commercial demand, leading to gradual degradation of the \nurban environment and living standards. In KPK, only 42% of the urban population has access to \npiped water, and typically for only 6 hours per day. Poor maintenance and leakage contribute to \nsignificant losses in piped water networks and contamination of the water supply. In 2014, 75% \nof supplied water in Abbottabad was unsafe for consumption, while water loss in Peshawar was \nestimated at 67% in 2015.5 Operational sewerage systems serve less than 5% of urban areas; \nwhere networks exist, they are poorly maintained and prone to overflow.6 Most wastewater is \nconveyed through open drains, and there are no functional wastewater treatment plants in KPK. \nWastewater and sewage are discharged untreated into natural drains, or onto farmland for \nirrigation purposes, which poses a significant health risk to the local farmers and communities.  \n \n \n1  Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, Mingora, and Peshawar.    \n2  Hafiz Pasha. 2018.

Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Services in Pakistan. Knowledge, Evidence and Learning for \nDevelopment. 28 November. Brighton, UK: Institute of Development Studies. \n \n  ", "2 \n5.  SWM  in  KPK  is  poor  because  of  a  lack  of  proper  infrastructure,  equipment,  and \nmanagement capacity. Less than 30% of municipal solid waste produced is collected.7 Pakistan \nis one of the 10 weakest countries in management of plastic waste in Asia.8 Cities in KPK are also \namong the main contributors of plastic waste trapped in rivers and drains. Without large-scale \nand properly engineered sanitary landfills, collected waste is either burned or disposed of in open \ndumps, typically along rivers and drains, severely polluting the surrounding environment. \n \n6.  Caregiving and household work primarily fall to women. Unreliable and inadequate water \nsupply and sanitation services increase women's time poverty and drudgery, and restrict their \nability to access the economic opportunities and social benefits offered by urbanization. The \noverall green urban space allocation in KPK cities is estimated at 3.5%, which is below the \nrecommended international norm of 15%\u201320%. This represents a missed opportunity to provide \nintrinsic environmental and aesthetic benefits to the urban population.9 KPK cities are highly \nvulnerable to disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate change. Since 2010, KPK has \nexperienced at least four major floods because of extreme climate events, causing economic loss \nand physical damage of urban infrastructure. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nunderscores the need for adequate social infrastructure to protect public health.  \n \n7.  Institutional challenges. The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GOKP) is promoting \nthe  decentralization  and  corporatization  of  municipal  services  to  improve  their  operational \nefficiency and sustainability. In 2015, the GOKP established seven independent utility companies \nto  take  over  the  provision  of  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  from  local  government \ninstitutions in seven primary cities in KPK. These water and sanitation services companies \n(WSSCs) are contracted under asset management arrangements. The WSSCs have begun \nintroducing  improvements  by  strengthening  client  relationships,  increasing  accountability  in \nmunicipal services provision, and improving both the quality and the coverage of services through \nperformance enhancement measures.  \n \n8.  However, the WSSCs in KPK are relatively new and still face several start-up challenges. \nExisting  tariffs  are  insufficient  to  sustain  their  operations,  and  the  WSSCs  require  further \nassistance in improving the quality and coverage of their services. In the absence of technical \nand financial resources, the WSSCs have limited capacity to prepare and implement new projects, \nwhich has contributed to the low quality of feasibility studies, safeguards, and engineering designs \nfor their municipal operations. Although the WSSCs have started reforming tariffs to support cost \nrecovery on a trial basis, they will require additional support to rationalize tariffs, improve revenue \ncollection,  and  strengthen  commercial  performance.  Women\u2019s  participation  at  WSSCs  is \nnegligible, with only a handful of women recruited for junior administrative positions, which \nrestricts the ability of WSSCs to engage effectively with women clients. Overall, the WSSCs need \nsupport  in  (i)  strengthening  governance  and  developing  sustainable  business  models;  (ii) \npromoting effective outsourcing and partnership arrangements; (iii) building staff capacity; and \n(iv) improving the gender balance to better cater to the needs of their clients, especially women. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  engagement.  In  November  2017,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  in \npartnership with the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund and the Cities Development \nInitiatives for Asia (CDIA), both under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility,10 completed \n \n7  Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GOKP). 2019.

These studies form \nthe basis of project scope and approaches. In March 2019, ADB financed the project readiness \nfinancing (PRF) facility to complete the detailed engineering designs, safeguard assessments, \nadvanced procurement, and establishment and staffing of the project management unit (PMU). \nConsequently, the project meets all the project readiness requirements for immediate project \nimplementation upon approval (paras. 16 and 36). ADB, in partnership with Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction, also processed a technical assistance for regional development plans using \nan integrated urban planning approach.11  \n  \n10.  In May 2020, ADB approved the allocation of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) 13 \nThematic Pool resources for the project to directly support the Sustainable Development Goal 5 \ntransformative gender agenda\u2014especially by reducing unpaid care and domestic work and \nensuring women\u2019s access to economic  and productive resources. The project will improve \nhouseholds\u2019 access to water and sanitation services, which will ease women\u2019s domestic work, \nand provide women with safe access to urban green spaces. The project will also facilitate \ninstitutionalization of gender-sensitive policies and programs to enable  the recruitment and \nretention of female technical workers in WSSCs. The ADF 13 grant enables the project to go \nbeyond its project scope to (i) provide women with scholarship and internship support and enlarge \nthe pool of female technical and professional workers in urban governance and water supply and \nsanitation; (ii) rehabilitate and upgrade the women\u2019s business development center (WBDC) in \nKohat, which will provide training and support to women entrepreneurs; (iii) establish a women\u2019s \ntechnical training center, which will provide women with formal technical skills so they can find \nemployment in the urban services sector; and (iv) facilitate the establishment of childcare facilities \nin WSSCs.  \n \n11.  Alignment with strategies. The project supports the government\u2019s development priorities \nestablished in (i) the KPK Water Act (2020), (ii) the amended Local Government Act (2019), (iii) \nthe Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) Strategy for KPK (2018), and (iv) Pakistan\u2019s \nNationally Determined Contributions.12 The IWRM strategy highlights the need to (i) improve \nspatial planning, (ii) address climate change, (iii) streamline municipal operation structures, and \n(iv) increase the role of public\u2013private partnerships. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan, 2021\u20132025 and the Strategy 2030 operational priorities (OPs) \nof (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1); (ii) accelerating progress in \ngender equity (OP2); (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability (OP3); (iv) making cities more livable (OP4); and (v) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP6).13 The project is also aligned with \nADB's Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies through its focus on the \ncircular economy (recycle and reuse) and reducing riverine and marine plastic pollution. \n \nB.

Output 1: Climate-resilient and gender-friendly urban infrastructure improved. This \noutput  will  comprise  three  subprojects:  (i)  water  supply  and  sanitation,  (ii)  solid  waste \nmanagement, and (iii) green urban infrastructure. The water supply and sanitation subproject will \ninclude improvements and augmentation of more than 1,200 km of water supply and 156 km of \nsewerage  network  and  household  connection,  and  construction  of  two  clean  water  supply \ntreatment facilities, two sewage treatment facilities, and at least 10 tube wells. About 150,000 new \nhouseholds will be connected to water supply systems. To increase efficiency of operations and \nconserve water, about 150,000 smart water meters and supervisory control and data acquisition \n(SCADA) systems will be installed. The SWM subproject will include the development of primary \nand  secondary  waste  collection  systems  and  five  third-generation  integrated  solid  waste \nmanagement (ISWM) facilities that support waste-to-energy conversion, material recovery, and \nwaste  reduction  and  recycling.  The  green  urban  infrastructure  subproject  will  finance  the \ndevelopment of green infrastructure to promote healthy and sustainable living environments. This \nsubproject will also finance the rehabilitation of seven existing green spaces and nature trails, \nimprovement  of  pedestrian  sidewalks  and  streets,  and  conversion  of one  existing  informal \ndumpsite to a park. Infrastructure under this output has been engineered to adapt to projected \nclimate impacts, and will contribute to urban climate adaptation by improving the overall quantity \nand quality of water resources and reducing the impacts of floods. The green urban spaces will \ninclude women-friendly facilities such as women\u2019s sports complexes, family areas, and well-lit \nrest areas and toilets, as well as street beautification with streetlights and closed-circuit television \ncameras. The output 1 will significantly contribute to the overall improvement of environment and \nlivability of the KPK cities.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Institutional  capacity  and  gender  inclusiveness  of  urban  service \nproviders, provincial government, and city governments strengthened. Under this output, \nthe project will finance (i) establishment of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Municipal Regulatory Office \n(KPRO), a new and dedicated body to improve the regulatory and oversight mechanism of \nmunicipal services; (ii) launch of a financial sustainability action plan to introduce cost-recovery \ntariff programs based on a new set of service standards; (iii) development of enterprise resource \nplanning (ERP) systems for the WSSCs to strengthen their operational systems and management \nof assets and resources; and (iv) improvement of a local government academy to train the staff \nof municipal service institutions, including WSSCs. These capacity-building initiatives will promote \ncommunity ownership, also ensuring the sustainability of these investments. The project will \ncapacitate communities and WSSCs in improving efficiency of operation and raising awareness \nand  knowledge  about  adaptation,  including  reduction  and  management  of  waste,  water \nconservation, increasing green cover in communities, and maintaining the efficacy of drainage \nsystems to reduce flooding. New customer service functions will be established to increase \nparticipation of clients, especially women, in-service provision. A feedback mechanism will be set \nup to improve billing and complaint-handling systems, and an effective communication strategy \nwill be prepared to promote behavior change in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices \nthat will contribute to COVID-19 recovery. \n \n15.  Output 3: Women\u2019s participation in urban governance and access to economic \nopportunities increased. This output will improve women\u2019s access to economic opportunities \nand increase their participation in urban governance and services. First, the WBDC in Kohat will \n \n15 All five cities are (i) divisional capitals in KPK, (ii) within top ten most populous cities of KPK, and (iii) have a \nfunctioning water and sanitation services company in place.   \n \n  ", "5 \nbe rehabilitated and upgraded.16 This center is a dedicated space for women\u2019s skills development \nand income-generating activities. It has a multipurpose community hall and exhibition center, an \noutdoor community recreational space, an area for selling home-based products, a day-care \nfacility for working mothers, and a food-selling area. The project will implement a livelihood skills \ndevelopment  program  for  women  that  includes  training  and  materials  support.  Second,  a \nscholarship program will be created for qualified female students to pursue education and \nresearch in urban development, engineering, environment, climate change, and similar fields. \nThird, the facilities of the Polytechnic Institute for Women in Peshawar will be equipped with better \ntrained teaching staff and improved day-care facilities, transportation, and hostel facilities. Last, \nan extensive formal and on-the-job WASH and climate change training program for women will \nbe provided. Outputs 2 and 3 will also support a new community-led climate adaptation and \nWASH initiative called \u201cSAFA KHAR DA TOLO\u201d (Clean City for All) within the new woman wings \nin WSSCs. The initiative will promote appropriate use of the project water and sanitation facilities \nand good hygiene practices at home and in the community. \n \n16.  Lessons. In financing 19 urban development and water projects in Pakistan from 1977 to \n2017, ADB learned two key lessons.17 First, it is important to achieve a high degree of project \nreadiness before approval of ensuing projects. After approval and loan effectivity of urban \nprojects, it takes time to complete and agree on detailed engineering designs and address \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues. This can cause significant implementation delays that \naffect project performance and delay delivery of benefits. The risk of subprojects being cancelled \nafter project approval is also high because of the multiple layers of approval required and the \ncompeting interests and demands in the limited urban space. Reducing these risks requires a \nmuch higher degree of project readiness. Huge discrepancies in cost estimates between the \nfeasibility and detailed engineering design stages have been observed because of social and \nlocation issues, which increases the chance that both ADB and the government will need to \nundertake onerous budget reallocations. The second key lesson concerns the importance of \nsupporting institutional reform and capacity development. The absence of a viable operational \nplan and capacity of government and municipal service providers has jeopardized the sustainable \noperation of previous investments in Pakistan. Based on these lessons, ADB used its first PRF to \nprepare for the proposed project (para. 9). The use of technologies such as online surveys, video \nconferencing, and telephonic interviews has enabled the efficient completion of preparatory \nactivities amid COVID-19-related lockdowns.  \n \nC.

In  March  2020,  the  GOKP  formed  a  task  force  to  explore  viable  innovations  and \ntechnologies that could be adopted in the project.18 Following the climate risk and vulnerability \nassessments,  the  GOKP  completed  climate  change  impact  assessments  on  all  project \ncomponents. Results of these assessments were incorporated into the project design to make \nthe project investment resilient to climate change impacts. Traditionally in Pakistan, utilities use \nwaste-stabilization ponds for wastewater treatment, but these require large areas of land that is \nin short supply around most KPK cities. If not adequately managed, stabilization ponds can \nnegatively impact the environment because of limited controls in their operating environment. The \nproject will introduce Pakistan\u2019s first activated sludge and trickling filter plants, which are more \n \n16 The GOKP is already operating this center but the facility requires upgrading with additional management capacity. \n17 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

KPK cities are \nalso quickly depleting groundwater resources through rapid urbanization and excessive use of \ntube wells. Under the project, groundwater sources will be replaced by new surface water facilities \nthat are more environmentally sustainable and energy efficient. For existing water and sanitation \nsystems, the project will provide more energy-efficient systems that offer lower operational costs. \nWater meters, SCADA, and ERP systems in WSSCs will help improve operations, conserve \nwater, and reduce operational losses.  \n \n18.  The  project  has  adopted  holistic,  integrated  SWM,  and  citywide  inclusive  sanitation \napproach. The SWM strategy will promote reducing, reusing, and recycling options through \nmaterial  recovery  facilities  for  recyclable  waste;  production  of  biogas  and  compost  from \nbiodegradable waste; and disposal of residual waste in properly designed, constructed, and \nmanaged landfills that have a leachate control system. Marginalized groups that live off waste \npicking will be absorbed as formal employees of WSSCs and their operators, contributing to \npoverty reduction and employment. Smaller sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in KPK \nbesides SWM include use of fossil fuels in vehicles and machinery, inefficient equipment and \npumps, excessive energy waste, and use of groundwater sources. To further reduce GHG \nemissions in the province, the GOKP will introduce modern transport fleets, more efficient solid \nwaste collection systems, and energy-efficient equipment.  \n \nD.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $122.92 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $38.94 million. ADB will finance 66.0% of adaptation and mitigation costs. The climate \nadaptation  measures,  incorporated  in  the  design  of  all  components,  account  for  expected \nincreases in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns that will increase water demand, \ndecrease  groundwater  and  surface  water  availability,  increase  flood  risks,  and  impact  the \nperformance of waste digestion processes and materials used in construction. \n \n24.  Project investment in recycling and treating solid waste; conversion of water sources to \nsurface water, energy efficiency option as backup system for water pumping, and light-emitting \ndiode (LED) lights; and harvesting energy from refuse-derived fuel combustion will contribute to \nclimate mitigation.

The Local Government, Elections and Rural Development Department (LGE&RDD) of \nthe GOKP will be the executing and implementing agency for the project, supported by the \nWSSCs of the five target cities (footnote 1). The PMU, established in June 2019, will be expanded \nwith dedicated, long-term incremental staff, secondees of senior staff from the LGE&RDD, and \nnew consultants for technical, financial, and safeguard due diligence, and procurement support. \nThe PMU will be responsible for project implementation under the overall guidance of the \nexecuting agency and will coordinate the project\u2019s implementation at the provincial level with the \nfive city implementing units (CIUs) that will be established on the premises of the WSSCs. The \nPMU and the provincial government will be responsible for strategic oversight at the city level, \nand the WSSCs within the respective cities through their CIUs will be responsible for the day-to-\nday  project  implementation  and  contract  management.  Implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2022\u2013December 2027 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Project Steering Committee will decide strategic project directions and \nhigher-level agenda at provincial level. \nCentral Project Administration and Management Committee will \ndecide routine day-to-day operational issues at provincial level.  \nProject Administration and Management Committee will decide \noperational issues at city level. \n(ii) Executing agency  LGE&RDD, GOKP  \n(iii) Key implementing  LGE&RDD, GOKP, Five WSSCs (Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, Mingora, \nagencies  Peshawar) and project management unit \n(iv) Implementation unit  Five city implementing units established in WSSCs in Abbottabad, Kohat, \nMardan, Mingora, and Peshawar  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  23 contracts  $455.0 \n(international)  million \nOpen competitive bidding (national)  5 contracts  $23.0 million \nRequest for quotations  Multiple contracts  $0.5 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (90:10)  4 contracts  $17.3 million \nSingle-source selectiona  1 contract  $20.0 million \nIndividual consultant selection  Multiple positions  $2.0 million \nRetroactive financing and  Civil works, equipment, and consultant recruitment are proposed for \nadvance contractingb   advance contracting and retroactive financing and, in the case of the ADB \nloan and grant, subject to a maximum of 20% of the ADB loan amount \nand grant amount for such expenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to \nthe date of signing of the ADB loan and grant. \nDisbursement  Disbursement of the ADB loan, grant, and administered cofinancing \nproceeds will follow ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe GOKP, ADB, and cofinancier. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; GOKP = Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; LGE&RDD = Local Government; \nElections and Rural Development Department; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; WSSC = water and \nsanitation services company. \n \n  ", "9 \na  Engineering design and construction management contract will be awarded to the same consultant of the phase 1 \ncontract funded under the PRF, through direct contracting, subject to satisfactory performance of the phase 1 \nconsultant (PRF paper footnote 5 and para. 16). \nb  Eight packages including two goods, four works, and two consulting services are for advance procurement. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Technical due diligence was carried out on the feasibility studies and detailed engineering \ndesigns for the proposed civil works using the integrated urban design principle and citywide \nsanitation planning. The GOKP also engaged with the third party design review consultants to \nconduct  independent  reviews  of  all  engineering  designs.  These  processes  confirmed  that \ninfrastructure designs are in line with the relevant national codes and standards.  \n \n27.  An essential feature of all subprojects is that they provide integrated and end-to-end \nsolutions for service delivery in accordance with the planning frameworks of the cities, wherever \nthese were available or in advance stages of preparation. Hydrological studies confirmed the \nsustainability of the surface sources for the water supply of Abbottabad and Mingora. Optimal \ntreatment processes for water and wastewater were proposed based on the quality of water to be \ntreated  and  the  surrounding  ecosystem.  A  conventional  treatment  process  comprising \ncoagulation, flocculation, and filtration followed by disinfection was found suitable to treat this raw \nwater for potable use in Abbottabad and Mingora. Rapid groundwater depletion is another major \nconcern in Abbottabad and Mingora, since the rate of abstraction is higher than the rate of \nrecharge. Using surface water instead of groundwater will alleviate these issues and ensure \nsustainable water supply for the residents of these two cities. KPK's depleted water network is \nthe major source of water contamination and loss in the province. Major portions of the water \ndistribution networks will be replaced in four KPK cities. This will control technical losses in the \nsystem and ensure pressurized flows, which in turn will enhance water quantity and quality. \nSignificant  energy  savings  are  expected  to  result  from  better  leakage  control,  metered \nconsumption, and energy-efficient equipment. Similarly, a sewer network has been designed to \nminimize  the  requirement  of  pumping  stations  (using  gravity  schemes)  to  reduce  energy \nconsumption and GHG emissions.  \n \n28.  SWM subprojects have been designed to reduce, recover, and recycle waste. Given the \nscarcity of available land in urban areas, solid waste disposal systems have been designed to \nminimize residual waste earmarked for landfills, thus maximizing the life of the facilities, and \nensure full utilization of whatever is economically recoverable. Similarly, landfill site selection and \ndesign  features  were  guided  by  a  range  of  technical  assessments  including  a  review  of \ninternational best practices; consultation with local communities, especially vulnerable groups; \nassessment  of  geology,  surface,  and  subsurface  hydrology;  ecological  and  environmental \nassessments; and climate change considerations. The project will contribute to post\u2013COVID-19 \nrecovery by improving social infrastructure, increasing economic opportunities, and promoting \nhealthy lifestyles. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  An economic analysis of the project was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.21 \nThe analysis shows that the project is economically viable, with components that have major \n \n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n \n ", "10 \nquantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits. Income loss during sick days and flood days, costs for \ntreating waterborne diseases and wastewater, and flood damage to infrastructure will be avoided. \nThe project will also help reduce GHG emissions, save time in trash disposal, and encourage \nresidents to pay for improved SWM. The estimated overall economic internal rate of return is \n14.1%, which is higher than the ADB economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%.22 \n \n30.  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the GOKP carried out a socioeconomic survey using \nonline survey services (SurveyMonkey) and social media rather than through physical face-to-\nface interviews.23 The survey results confirmed that people in KPK are willing to pay more for \nimproved municipal services. The fiscal viability of the project was also assessed through \nconsultations with WSSCs and desk reviews of the projected financial performance of WSSCs. \nThese assessments indicate that the annual operating costs of WSSCs average $20 million, \nprovided as revenue grants through budgetary transfers from the provincial government. Although \nthe financial sustainability of urban services may still depend on budgetary transfers, such \ntransfers are expected to decrease over time. Hence, the project is designed to generate \nincremental revenue by expanding service area coverage, volume-based metered service using \nsmart metering technologies, outsourcing the operation of revenue-earning components like \ncomposting and biogas plants to the private sector. The GOKP has also approved an institutional \nreform and capacity development road map that aims to improve the operational and financial \nsustainability of WSSCs. Ways to incrementally increase WSSC revenues include revising tariff \nstructures,  rationalizing  operating  and  administrative  costs,  improving  service  standards, \ninstalling about 150,000 water meters, and reducing nonrevenue water in district-metered areas. \nHowever, incremental revenues are not likely to result in net positive cash flows because tariff \nlevels will remain below cost recovery. Accordingly, the financial internal rate of return calculation \nwas not considered relevant.  The fiscal capacity of the provincial government  to fund net \nincremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs was assessed. The analysis revealed that \nthe  provincial  government  can  adequately  fund  the  WSSCs,  while  institutional  review  and \ncapacity-building (IRCB) reforms are likely to improve the scale of WSSCs\u2019 revenues. In view of \nthese considerations, the project is assessed to be financially viable. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  Sustainability challenges facing the project include (i) low capacity of municipal operators \nfor O&M, (ii) lack of quality independent oversight of municipal services and standards of \noperations, and (iii) lack of cost recovery for municipal services where applicable. Outputs 1 and \n2 of the project focus on municipal infrastructure gaps, and improving the quality and efficiency of \nthe operations to reduce the cost of services. In April 2019, the GOKP approved the amended \nLocal Government Act to make provincial local government systems more efficient, responsive, \nand accountable. The project will support the GOKP to implement the actions described in the \nact. For instance, the project will finance the establishment of oversight body that will develop \nservice standards and introduce cost-recovery tariffs. To support capacity development, the Local \nGovernment  Academy,  a  training  institution  for  the  LGE&RDD  and  the  WSSCs,  will  be \nstrengthened and revitalized. The academy will provide capacity development programs using a \nblended approach of classroom learning, online courses, and on-the-job mentoring of WSSC \nmanagement and board. The academy will also provide specialized training to WSSC staff in \nfinance, billing, revenue, O&M, planning and design, asset management, ERP, construction \nmanagement, customer relations, and more. These in-service courses will be linked to career \n \n22 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 The willingness-to-pay survey was carried out in May 2021 in coordination with the GOKP, PMU, and the ADB team. \nA total of 550 people in KPK responded. Affordability analysis was also undertaken to support the survey. \n \n  ", "11 \nprogression within WSSCs. Under the gender components (output 3), the project will support \nresearch and development by funding internship programs targeting women to improve the quality \nof the workforce and bring new talent into the WSSCs. These internships will be institutionalized \nin the WSSC human resource departments to ensure sustainability and replicability in similar \ncompanies. WSSCs will start twinning program with other municipal service providers to facilitate \ncross fertilization of ideas.24  \n \n32.  The GOKP approved the Institutional Reform Roadmap to be implemented under the \nproject.25 The road map's main component is the establishment of the KPRO to regulate and \nsupervise water supply, sanitation, and SWM services in KPK. The project will support capacity \ndevelopment of the KPRO. During PRF implementation, the GOKP also prepared operational \nplans that define performance benchmarks and service standards for all WSSC operations. The \nproject will support the implementation of these operational plans and will establish benchmarks \nfor service quality. A financial sustainability action plan outlining the current and projected \nrevenues, consumer surveys, operational costs, and cost-recovery tariffs of each type and level \nof services will be developed for all WSSCs. The financial sustainability action plan will be \nreinforced by the IRCB reforms under the PRF and will form the basis for an independent review \nof operations, regulations, and tariff setting for WSSCs by the KPRO once established.  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n33.  The PRF facility has proven to be effective in mitigating the potential risks of ensuing \nprojects in financial management, fiduciary, and procurement. The PMU staff have gained project \nimplementation experience and have participated in ADB training programs in procurement and \nfinancial management. The PRF facility\u2019s performance has been rated on track, meeting all \nperformance rating criteria. \n \n34.  Financial management. ADB carried out a financial management assessment of the \nPMU and WSSCs. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial, largely \nbecause of the project's wide geographic spread and large scale. The assessment concluded that \nthe PMU has sufficient experience in managing ADB projects, including development of financial \nmanagement guidelines and proper documentations of all transactions. However, the PMU \nrequires additional financial management staff given the expected volume and complexity of \nincremental financial management activities. The implementing bodies (i.e., the WSSCs) were \nalso found to possess adequate departmental financial management structures and policies. \nProcedures  are  adequately  designed  and  documented.  However,  significant  delays  in  the \nappointment of the board of directors, high financial management staff turnover, a general \nabsence of financial management staff and internal audit functions, delays in the finalization of \nentity-level audits, and a lack of experience in managing ADB-funded projects make the overall \npre-mitigation financial management risk of WSSCs substantial.  \n \n35.  To mitigate financial management risk, the GOKP agreed to centralize project financial \nmanagement and funds flow at the PMU. The GOKP has agreed to allocate additional human \nresources for project financial management. The GOKP will also prepare a financial management \naction plan to strengthen the PMU\u2019s financial management governance, systems and internal \ncontrols, staff resources, and accountability arrangements. In parallel, engagement with WSSCs \nwill be continued to build sustainable governance and financial management capacity in the \nmedium term. The IRCB reforms will continue to support WSSCs in implementing these actions. \n \n24 For instance, Maynilad Water in the Philippines and Macau Water have staff capacity development programs. \n25 The GOKP approved the road map on 10 June 2021 and it is included as part of PC-1 for the project. \n \n ", "12 \nThe financial management action plan has been included in the PAM (footnote 21), which will \nprovide more localized financial management options at the city level during implementation. \n \n36.  Procurement. Supported by the PRF, the GOKP has completed the detailed engineering \ndesigns, bills of quantities, terms of reference for consultants, and procurement documents and \nmaster bidding documents. The PMU was established in September 2019, and has been exposed \nto ADB operations, including procurement. The project has already achieved high procurement \nreadiness with the commencement of six out of 11 bidding documents and two consultant \nrecruitments for advance procurement (worth about 75% of total ADB financing) for 2021\u20132022 \nprocurement. Despite the high procurement readiness, the overall procurement risk is assessed \nas high mainly because of the large volume of subprojects and contract managements across \nfive cities. As additional mitigation measures, the GOKP agrees to (i) increase procurement staff \npositions to support the PMU, (ii) engage external consultant firms to oversee and support the \nPMU (including preparation and prior review of all bidding documents and contracts), and (iii) \nbuild procurement good practices in coordination with ADB.26 All procurement of civil works, \ngoods, and consulting services will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time), and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time).  \n \n37.  Anticorruption  measures.  Pakistan  ranked  124  out  of  180  countries  in  the  2020 \nCorruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International.27 The provincial governments of \nPakistan are responsible for legislations in their respective provinces. Since 2013, there have \nbeen several legislative efforts to combat corruption in KPK. Under the PRF, ADB performed \nintegrity  due  diligence  of  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  and  found  no \nsignificant risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  WSSCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. Based on integrity due diligence and risk \nassessments, several mitigation measures have been adopted, including (i) regular update of the \nproject website and social media to enhance transparency of the project; and (ii) establishment \nof a grievance redress mechanism (GRM) to ensure effective resolutions of grievances, if any. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  The project will benefit about 3.5 million people in five KPK cities, of which an estimated \n10% are poor.28 The project will improve water supply and sanitation services to reduce the \nincidence  of  waterborne  disease  and  household  health  expenses  and  implement  ISWM \noperations to improve the health of citizens and the value of assets. The project design adopts an \ninclusive approach and pro-poor features. Key design elements include (i) subsidized tariffs for \nmunicipal services provided for poor, vulnerable, and low-income households from socially \nexcluded classes and vulnerable segments of the population;29 (ii) the Clean City for All initiative \nfor promoting water conservation, SWM, and green practices, which will be offered to women and \nyouth including poor and low-income households (para. 15); (iii) scholarships and internship \n \n26 ADB. 2017.

Gender. Gender equality issues addressed by the project include (i) lack of access to 24/7 \nsafe water supply and sanitation services, which makes it difficult for women, especially poor \nwomen, to do household work; (ii) limited women\u2019s participation in urban water supply and \nsanitation because the WSSCs and other urban sector companies are predominantly staffed by \nmen; and (iii) low women\u2019s urban labor force participation, reaching only 8% in KPK. Pakistan \nalso has one of the lowest rates of women entrepreneurs in the world\u2014only 8% of micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises are owned by women. Categorized as gender equity theme, the \nproject will (i) provide households in project KPK cities with 24/7 clean water supply and sanitation \nservices; (ii) increase the number of women technical employees in WSSCs and WSSC boards, \nand support the development of gender policies at WSSCs; (iii) provide scholarship and internship \nopportunities for female students in science, technology, engineering, and related courses for \npotential employment in technical positions; (iv) construct a WBDC with a livelihood training \nprogram; (v) establish a Community Incentive Fund to support women entrepreneurs in setting \nup green businesses; and (vi) upgrade a technical training institute to promote women\u2019s formal \ntechnical skills training. The ADF 13 gender thematic pool grant will finance the scholarship for \nwomen and girls; the construction of the WBDC and rehabilitation of the Polytechnic Institute for \nWomen,  including  development  of  their  training  programs;  and  the  establishment  of  the \nCommunity Incentive Fund. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n41.  Environment  (category  A).  The  GOKP  prepared  the  environmental  safeguards \ndocumentation to meet the requirements of both the KPK Environmental Protection Agency and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Four draft environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the \nISWM facilities were disclosed in March 2021. The ISWM facilities may cause site-specific \nadverse environmental impacts on air, water, and land quality. The measures proposed in the \nEIAs are to offset any adverse environmental impacts resulting from ISWM operations. The \noverall impact of ISWM operations will be positive, with net reductions in GHG emissions to be \nachieved during operations estimated at 250,630 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. In \naddition to preparing the EIAs, the GOKP also prepared eight initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) for water supply, sewage treatment plants, and green urban space subproject that includes \nconverting a landfill to a park. Environmental management plans (EMPs) were prepared to cover \nall subprojects including category C subprojects. \n \n42.  The potential impacts from all subprojects have been assessed to be site-specific, and \nmost  of  them  can  be  readily  mitigated  and  minimized  using  effective  design  changes, \nhousekeeping during implementation, and effective controls during facility operations. Under the \nPRF, the GOKP organized a series of stakeholder consultations, and the community views were \nincorporated into the EIAs, IEEs, EMPs, and project designs. Meaningful engagement with \ncommunities will continue during project implementation. The EIAs, IEEs, and EMPs will be \nincluded as part of the bid and contract documents, and disclosed on the ADB and project \nwebsites. These documents will also be disclosed using local language. No contract will be \nawarded until ADB approves the updated or final EIAs, IEEs, and EMPs. Prior to execution of civil \n \n30 ADB.

Grievances will be handled following the project GRM \nand details provided in the EIAs, IEEs, and EMPs. \n \n43.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  A  consolidated  social  due  diligence  report \nscreened  all  24  subprojects  for  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Fifteen  subprojects  were \nassessed as not having any involuntary resettlement impact, while nine subprojects have varying \ndegrees  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  About  215.24  acres  of  private  land \ncomprising 30.43 acres of agriculture land and 184.81 acres of barren land will be required. An \nestimated 10,856 persons will be affected. Of these, 21 households (with 143 members) will likely \nlose 10% or more of their agriculture land. All others will lose barren land only. Six households, \ntotaling about 40 individuals, living within the buffer zone of one integrated landfill site may need \nto relocate. Although the number of severely affected persons is fewer than 200, there is a risk \nthat additional impacts may arise given the location and alignment of the subprojects (urban, near \nsettlements, and in busy commercial areas). Based on the detailed engineering designs, the \nGOKP prepared and disclosed land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) and corrective \naction plans to address involuntary resettlement issues arising from the project. The GOKP will \nupdate these documents after completing the independent valuation study and issuance of \ndisplaced person acquaintance roll from the Revenue Department.  \n \n44.  The GOKP also prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) to \naddress identified and unanticipated impacts that may arise during project implementation. The \nGOKP issued the notification of Section 5 under Pakistan\u2019s Land Acquisition Act for three \nsubprojects as part of the normal land acquisition procedures. These safeguard documents have \nbeen disclosed on the project website and also shared with affected persons. Implementation-\nready plans will be a condition for contract award, while commencement of civil works will be \nconditional on full disbursement of compensation payments and assistance according to the \napproved LARPs or corrective action plans as verified in a compliance report. The project will \ninclude internal and external resettlement monitoring for the entire project implementation period. \nThe GOKP will disclose semiannual social monitoring reports in the project website. The project \nmanagement  and  construction  supervision  consultants  to  be  hired  under  the  project  are \nresponsible  for  supporting  CIUs  in  strengthening  safeguard  capacity  and  day-to-day \nimplementation, periodic monitoring of LARPs, and management of the project-based GRM. \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). A consolidated social due diligence report assessed \nthe impact on indigenous peoples through documentary reviews, field visits, and consultations \nwith locals in the subproject areas. No impacts on indigenous peoples, involving direct or indirect \nimpacts to the dignity, human rights, livelihood  systems, territories, or natural and cultural \nresponses that are used, owned, or occupied by indigenous peoples, is anticipated per ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project has been classified category C for indigenous peoples. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n46.  The PRF has helped the GOKP mitigate risks substantively.31 The PMU has been \nestablished and its key staff have gained operations experience. The PMU has also prepared all \nprocurement documents and safeguard assessments, reducing operational risks. There are \nseveral substantial risks because of the project's large scale and geographic spread (Table 4).32 \n \n31 ADB.
