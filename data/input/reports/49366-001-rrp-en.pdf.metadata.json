THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to B1,676 million (or its equivalent in US dollars) to Stumpf Energy Solutions (Thailand) \nand Stumpf Energy Tranche B1 for the Distributed Commercial Solar Power Project in Thailand.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  As  of  February  2016,  Thailand\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was  39,756 \nmegawatts (MW). Generation depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 65% produced by \nnatural gas and 20% produced by coal and lignite, with only 6% produced by renewable energy \nsources  (excluding  large  hydroelectric  power  plants).  Natural  gas  has  traditionally  been \nThailand\u2019s reliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves \nin the Gulf of Thailand mean the country must begin the transition towards securing alternative \nsources. As part of its strategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  prepared  the  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132036,3 \nwhich (i) notes the significant potential of solar power in Thailand, and (ii) indicates that energy \nimports can be avoided through developing domestic solar projects with private investment. The \nplan  aims to  increase the  share  of renewable  energy  used for  power generation to  30%, \nincluding the installation of 19,634 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW \ncoming from solar power. \n \n3.  To  implement  Strategy  2020  and  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for \nThailand of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which emphasize support for clean energy, \nADB  identified  the  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  the  project  through  close \ncooperation and strong relationships with various sponsors and financial institutions in Thailand \nbuilt over the last 5 years. Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role \nin devising an innovative financing structure of \u2018single loan, multiple projects\u2019, which significantly \nreduces transaction costs, improves project viability and enhances scalability of the business \nmodel, and played catalytic role of mobilizing investment from local commercial banks.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project involves the rollout and operation of multiple solar photovoltaic installations, \neach with a capacity ranging from 400 kilowatts-peak (kWp) to 5 megawatts-peak (MWp), on \nrooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings owned or \nleased by host companies in Thailand up to an aggregate capacity of 100 MW and will be \ninstalled at no up-front cost to the host companies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n \n                                                             \n1  Stumpf Energy Solutions II (Thailand) is the proposed name of a special purpose vehicle that the sponsor, Stumpf \nEnergy, is in the process of incorporating. Incorporation of the special purpose vehicle will be completed prior to execution \nof the finance documents, and its shareholders will be the same as that of Stumpf Energy Solutions (Thailand). In this \nreport, the name \u201cStumpf Energy Tranche B\u201d is used to refer to the name of the second borrower. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy, 2015, Alternative Energy Development Plan 2015-2036. Bangkok. ", "2  \n5.  The project, which does not rely on Thai FIT regime, has strong potential to be scaled \nup,  particularly  in  Thailand\u2019s  growing  manufacturing  sector.  Host  companies  will  maintain \nconnections to the national grid to augment their power supply, and they will benefit from the \nproject in the following ways: (i) discounted electricity prices, (ii) more reliable electricity supply, \n(iii) avoidance of having to pay the up-front costs associated with developing their own solar \npower facilities, (iv) reduced emissions, and (v) an improved corporate image. The project offers \nattractive benefits for Thailand, including (i) helping it reach its renewable energy target by \nscaling up grid-parity solar power; and (ii) increasing its use of distributed generation (i.e., power \nthat is generated where it is consumed), thereby reducing the need to upgrade and maintain \ngrid infrastructure. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7.  Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role in devising an \ninnovative  financing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019,  where  the  financing \ncontemplated will be used to support multiple solar projects on rooftops or elsewhere on the \npremises of commercial and/or industrial buildings that have been traditionally difficult to finance \nindividually due to their smaller size. This structure significantly reduces transaction costs borne \nby each subproject, thereby increasing their standalone viability and enhancing the scalability of \nthe business model of grid-parity solar projects that do not require FIT subsidies in Thailand.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n3.  The Borrowers and Sponsor \n8.  The borrowers will be special purpose vehicles incorporated in Thailand. Stumpf Energy \nSolutions (Thailand) has already been incorporated and Stumpf Energy Tranche B is in the \nprocess of being incorporated.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe  borrowers  are  (or  will,  following  incorporation,  be)  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  the \nsponsor,  Stumpf  Energy,  a  newly  set  up  entity  which  is  wholly  and  indirectly  owned  by \nMillennium Privatstiftung in Austria and Georg Stumpf, the ultimate beneficiary of Millennium \nPrivatstiftung.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nOne of its wholly owned subsidiaries, M+W Group, is a global engineering, construction, and \nproject management company that specializes in the fields of advanced technology facilities, life \nscience and chemicals, energy, and environmental technologies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n   ", "  3\nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n14.  Impacts.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  the  business  model  of  solar \nprojects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings that \ndo not require FIT subsidies in Thailand. This will lead to unlocking of vast potential to scale up \nsolar photovoltaic installations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or \nindustrial buildings, particularly in Thailand\u2019s growing manufacturing sector. The project will also \ncontribute to the diversification of Thailand\u2019s energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, \nthus helping the country progress toward its renewable energy target. Solar energy is a clean \nand  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  strengthens \nenergy security, and reduces reliance on fossil fuel. The project is also aligned with one of the \nsustainable  development  goals  of  the  United  Nations\u2019  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment: \u201cEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\u201d4 \n \n15.  Outcome. The outcome will be the demonstration of the sustainability of operations of \nthe private sector grid-parity rooftop solar business model in Thailand. \n \n16.  Output.  The  output  will  be  the  rollout  and  operation  of  multiple  solar  photovoltaic \ninstallations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings, \nwith a total capacity of up to 100 MW. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n17.  Consistency with ADB Strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020. 5  The  review  reaffirmed  ADB\u2019s  support  under  Strategy  2020  for  (i) \nenvironmentally sustainable development; (ii) the role of the private sector in meeting growing \nenergy demand in the region; and (iii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure \ndevelopment, finance, and other areas.6 The midterm review also supported the expansion of \nenvironmentally friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy generation and use, as well \nas a larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure. \n \n18.  Consistency  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand, which supports three core strategic pillars: (i) \nknowledge and innovation, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) regional cooperation and \nintegration. These strategic pillars are operationalized in four program areas: (i) infrastructure; \n(ii) finance sector development; (iii) environment, including climate change; and (iv) regional \ncooperation and integration.7 The government\u2019s Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u2013\n2036 sets a target of increasing the share of renewable energy and alternative energy used for \npower generation to 30% by 2036, including the installation of 19,634 MW of renewable energy \ncapacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \n19.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which emphasizes investments in \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy, and wider access to energy.8 The project will contribute to \nADB\u2019s target of doubling annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020 (up from the current $3 \nbillion), and to the Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s target of one in four of its projects \napproved each year being a clean energy project. \n \n                                                             \n4 United Nations. 2015.

As ADB\u2019s first grid-parity solar project in Thailand, the project has inherent risks that are \nabsent in utility-scale solar projects with FIT subsidies. ADB\u2019s active participation enhances \nlocal commercial banks\u2019 confidence to co-invest because ADB is seen as playing an important \nrole  in  the  early  stage  of  development  of  the  grid-parity  rooftop  solar  business  model  by \ncatalyzing investment and setting high standards for subsequent scale-up in Thailand. ADB\u2019s \ninnovative  financing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs, increase project viability, and enhance scalability of the business model. \n \n27.  Although Thailand has a relatively strong banking sector, local commercial banks are \nunable to provide long tenors that are necessary for the innovative grid-parity solar business \nmodel. Shorter tenors reduce the feasibility and increase the operational leverage of projects, \nwhich may lead to undue financial distress. With high up-front capital costs and long-term \nrevenue streams, renewable energy projects require lower amortization profiles to enhance their \nfinancial viability. ADB\u2019s financial assistance fills a funding gap in long-term finance that will \nensure that commercial rooftop solar projects are financed in a sound and sustainable manner. \n \nC.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n36.  The  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.10 The borrowers will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to achieve compliance. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n37.  The sponsor and Stumpf Energy Solutions (Thailand) were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of \nimplementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, \nand the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes \nappropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, \nand remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n                                                             \n10 ADB. 2003.
