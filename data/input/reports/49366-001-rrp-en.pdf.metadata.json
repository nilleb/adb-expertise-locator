Generation  depends  heavily  on  conventional  fuels,  with  65%  produced  by \nnatural gas and 20% produced by coal and lignite, with only 6% produced by renewable energy \nsources  (excluding  large  hydroelectric  power  plants).  Natural  gas  has  traditionally  been \nThailand\u2019s reliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves \nin the Gulf of Thailand mean the country must begin the transition towards securing alternative \nsources. As part of its strategy to diversify the energy mix and promote renewable energy, the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  prepared  the  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2015\u20132036, 3 \nwhich (i) notes the significant potential of solar power in Thailand, and (ii) indicates that energy \nimports can be avoided through developing domestic solar projects with private investment. The \nplan  aims  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  used  for  power  generation  to  30%, \nincluding the installation of 19,634 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW \ncoming from solar power. \n \nTo  implement  Strategy  2020  and  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for \n3. \nThailand  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  emphasize  support  for  clean  energy, \nADB  identified  the  opportunity  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  the  project  through  close \ncooperation and strong relationships with various sponsors and financial institutions in Thailand \nbuilt over the last 5 years. Since its early engagement in the project, ADB has played a key role \nin devising an innovative financing structure of \u2018single loan, multiple projects\u2019, which significantly \nreduces  transaction  costs,  improves  project  viability  and  enhances  scalability  of  the  business \nmodel, and played catalytic role of mobilizing investment from local commercial banks.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n4. \nThe project involves the rollout and operation of multiple solar photovoltaic installations, \neach  with  a  capacity  ranging  from  400  kilowatts-peak  (kWp)  to  5  megawatts-peak  (MWp),  on \nrooftops  or  elsewhere  on  the  premises  of  commercial  and/or  industrial  buildings  owned  or \nleased  by  host  companies  in  Thailand  up  to  an  aggregate  capacity  of  100  MW  and  will  be \ninstalled at no up-front cost to the host companies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n \n\n                                                              \n1  Stumpf  Energy  Solutions  II  (Thailand)  is  the  proposed  name  of  a  special  purpose  vehicle  that  the  sponsor,  Stumpf \nEnergy, is in the process of incorporating. Incorporation of the special purpose vehicle will be completed prior to execution \nof  the  finance  documents,  and  its  shareholders  will  be  the  same  as  that  of  Stumpf  Energy  Solutions  (Thailand).  In  this \nreport, the name \u201cStumpf Energy Tranche B\u201d is used to refer to the name of the second borrower. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy, 2015, Alternative Energy Development Plan 2015-2036. Bangkok. \n\n\f 2\n\nThe  project,  which  does  not  rely  on Thai  FIT regime,  has  strong  potential  to  be  scaled \n5. \nup,  particularly  in  Thailand\u2019s  growing  manufacturing  sector.  Host  companies  will  maintain \nconnections  to  the  national  grid  to  augment  their  power  supply,  and  they  will  benefit  from  the \nproject in the following ways: (i) discounted electricity prices, (ii) more reliable electricity supply, \n(iii)  avoidance  of  having  to  pay  the  up-front  costs  associated  with  developing  their  own  solar \npower facilities, (iv) reduced emissions, and (v) an improved corporate image. The project offers \nattractive  benefits  for  Thailand,  including  (i)  helping  it  reach  its  renewable  energy  target  by \nscaling up grid-parity solar power; and (ii) increasing its use of distributed generation (i.e., power \nthat  is  generated  where  it  is  consumed),  thereby  reducing  the  need  to  upgrade  and  maintain \ngrid infrastructure. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nSince  its  early  engagement  in  the  project,  ADB  has  played  a  key  role  in  devising  an \n7. \ninnovative \nfinancing \ncontemplated  will  be  used  to  support  multiple  solar  projects  on  rooftops  or  elsewhere  on  the \npremises of commercial and/or industrial buildings that have been traditionally difficult to finance \nindividually due to their smaller size. This structure significantly reduces transaction costs borne \nby each subproject, thereby increasing their standalone viability and enhancing the scalability of \nthe business model of grid-parity solar projects that do not require FIT subsidies in Thailand.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nloan,  multiple  projects\u2019,  where \n\nfinancing  structure  of \n\n\u2018single \n\nthe \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrowers and Sponsor \n\n8. \nThe borrowers will be special purpose vehicles incorporated in Thailand. Stumpf Energy \nSolutions  (Thailand)  has  already  been  incorporated  and  Stumpf  Energy  Tranche  B  is  in  the \nprocess of being incorporated.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe  borrowers  are  (or  will,  following  incorporation,  be)  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  the \nsponsor,  Stumpf  Energy,  a  newly  set  up  entity  which  is  wholly  and  indirectly  owned  by \nMillennium  Privatstiftung  in  Austria  and  Georg  Stumpf,  the  ultimate  beneficiary  of  Millennium \nPrivatstiftung.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nOne  of  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  M+W  Group,  is  a  global  engineering,  construction,  and \nproject management company that specializes in the fields of advanced technology facilities, life \nscience and chemicals, energy, and environmental technologies.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n14. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  the  business  model  of  solar \nprojects on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings that \ndo not require FIT subsidies in Thailand. This will lead to unlocking of vast potential to scale up \nsolar photovoltaic installations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or \nindustrial buildings, particularly in Thailand\u2019s growing manufacturing sector. The project will also \ncontribute to the diversification of Thailand\u2019s energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, \nthus  helping  the country  progress  toward  its  renewable  energy  target.  Solar  energy  is  a  clean \nand  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  strengthens \nenergy security, and reduces reliance on fossil fuel. The project is also aligned with one of the \nsustainable  development  goals  of \nfor  Sustainable \nDevelopment: \u201cEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\u201d4 \n \n15. \nthe private sector grid-parity rooftop solar business model in Thailand. \n \n16. \nOutput.  The  output  will  be  the  rollout  and  operation  of  multiple  solar  photovoltaic \ninstallations on rooftops or elsewhere on the premises of commercial and/or industrial buildings, \nwith a total capacity of up to 100 MW. \n \nC. \n\nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  the  demonstration  of  the  sustainability  of  operations  of \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nthe  United  Nations\u2019  2030  Agenda \n\n17. \nConsistency with ADB Strategy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020. 5  The  review  reaffirmed  ADB\u2019s  support  under  Strategy  2020  for  (i) \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development; (ii)  the  role  of the  private  sector  in meeting growing \nenergy demand in the region; and (iii) capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure \ndevelopment,  finance,  and  other  areas.6 The  midterm  review  also  supported  the  expansion  of \nenvironmentally friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy generation and use, as well \nas a larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for  Thailand,  which  supports  three  core  strategic  pillars:  (i) \nknowledge  and  innovation,  (ii)  private  sector  development,  and  (iii)  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. These  strategic  pillars  are  operationalized  in  four  program  areas: (i)  infrastructure; \n(ii)  finance  sector  development;  (iii)  environment,  including  climate  change;  and  (iv)  regional \ncooperation  and  integration.7 The  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2015\u2013\n2036 sets a target of increasing the share of renewable energy and alternative energy used for \npower generation to 30% by 2036, including the installation of 19,634 MW of renewable energy \ncapacity by 2036, with 6,000 MW coming from solar power. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in \n19. \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy, and wider access to energy.8 The project will contribute to \nADB\u2019s target of doubling annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020 (up from the current $3 \nbillion),  and  to  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s  target  of  one  in  four  of  its  projects \napproved each year being a clean energy project. \n \n\n                                                              \n4 United Nations. 2015.

The  project  will \nenter  into  long-term  power  purchase  agreements  directly  with  the  host  companies, \nwhich  will  each  be \nfor \ncreditworthiness developed by the ADB and Siam Commercial Bank. \nThe project involves the development of multiple solar subprojects using a \u2018single loan, \nmultiple project\u2019 financing structure.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nThe  project  will  be  developed  and  managed  by  the  borrowers,  Stumpf  Energy \nSolutions (Thailand) and Stumpf Energy Tranche B.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nThe project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey EPC contract \ncovering all design, engineering, supply, construction, testing, and commissioning. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nSolar power has relatively high up-front capital costs and minimal operating costs. The \nlong-term  average  cost  structure  is  highly  predictable,  with  limited  expenditure  on \nmaintenance and parts replacement and no ongoing fuel expense. As debt financing is \nthe only material expense, it drives the economics and viability of solar power projects. \nO&M  requirements  for  solar  power  projects  are  relatively  low  and  usually  comprise \nelectrical  works,  panel  cleaning,  regular  inspections,  minor  repairs,  measurements, \ndata verification, reporting, and site security.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nPerformance \nThe borrowers will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements and annual audited \nfinancial statements on a consolidated basis. \nmonitoring \nEPC = engineering\u2013procurement\u2013construction, O&M = operation and maintenance, Q = quarter. \nSource: Stumpf Energy. \n \n\nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n                                                              \n9  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n26. \nAs ADB\u2019s first grid-parity solar project in Thailand, the project has inherent risks that are \nabsent  in  utility-scale  solar  projects  with  FIT  subsidies.  ADB\u2019s  active  participation  enhances \nlocal commercial banks\u2019 confidence to co-invest because ADB is seen as playing an important \nrole  in  the  early  stage  of  development  of  the  grid-parity  rooftop  solar  business  model  by \ncatalyzing  investment  and  setting  high  standards  for  subsequent  scale-up  in  Thailand.  ADB\u2019s \ninnovative  financing  structure  of  \u2018single  loan,  multiple  projects\u2019  will  significantly  reduce \ntransaction costs, increase project viability, and enhance scalability of the business model. \n \n27. \nAlthough  Thailand  has  a  relatively  strong  banking  sector,  local  commercial  banks  are \nunable  to  provide  long  tenors  that  are  necessary  for  the  innovative  grid-parity  solar  business \nmodel.  Shorter  tenors  reduce  the  feasibility  and  increase  the  operational  leverage  of  projects, \nwhich  may  lead  to  undue  financial  distress.  With  high  up-front  capital  costs  and  long-term \nrevenue streams, renewable energy projects require lower amortization profiles to enhance their \nfinancial  viability.  ADB\u2019s  financial  assistance  fills  a  funding  gap  in  long-term  finance  that  will \nensure that commercial rooftop solar projects are financed in a sound and sustainable manner. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \n\n35. \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n36. \nThe  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.10 The borrowers will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken to achieve compliance.
