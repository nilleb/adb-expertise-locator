Of \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nYears  of  neglect  since  independence  have  left  the  Kyrgyz  power  sector  in  a  state  of \ndisrepair. Facilities are dilapidated, losses are high, tariffs are below cost-recovery, and financial \nperformance is poor. The power sector needs an urgent overhaul before the functionality of the \nsystem is lost. It needs to improve energy efficiency, energy security, and regional power trade. \nThe proposed project is critical to attaining these goals. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  abundant  hydropower  resources.  Over  95%  of  energy \n3. \ngenerated  comes \ninstalled  capacity  of \n3,713 megawatts  (MW),  2,950  MW  (79.5%)  is  HPPs  and  763  MW  (20.5%)  is  combined  heat \nand  power  plants.  While  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  the  largest  net  power  exporter  of  the  Central \nAsian Power System (CAPS) by exporting surplus hydropower during summer, load shedding is \nfrequent during winter when the river discharge is low. Such a supply pattern calls for regional \npower trade. \n \nReliable  supply  is  also  hindered  by  (i)  high  system  losses  (6%  transmission  loss  and \n4. \n26%  distribution  loss  in  2009),  (ii)  inefficient  system  operation  using  obsolete  technology, \n(iii) faults caused by dilapidated equipment used since the Soviet era, and (iv) poor governance \nand financial management. These factors also reduce power exports. Since export revenue is \nused to import costly fuel for combined heat and power plants in winter, reduced summer export \nleads to insufficient domestic supply in winter. \n \n5. \nSince nearly 60% of electricity consumption is residential, the performance of the power \nsector directly affects the population. The people\u2019s uprising of April 2010 was partly fuelled by \npublic  anger  over  the  nontransparent  manner  in  which  the  tariff  was  doubled  in  January  2010 \ndespite  poor  supply.  Power  sector  reform  that  involved  unbundling  of  the  vertically  integrated \nutility2 in 2001 was expected to boost transparency and efficiency. However, the sector remains \nin  poor  condition  even  after  a  decade.  It  is  now  perceived  that  the  recommended  industry \nstructure  may  not  have  been  suitable  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  That  there  are  four  distribution \ncompanies  to  supply  just  over  1 million  customers  is  seen  as  an  obstacle  to  better  sector \nperformance.  \n \n6. \nWhile  the  entire  power  sector  needs  to  be  modernized,  the  government  places  top \npriority on loss reduction and more effective governance. This is not only necessary to improve \ncommercial  operations,  but  to  regain  people\u2019s  confidence  in  the  power  sector  and  ensure \nstability. To achieve this, the government issued a presidential decree known as the \u201cFuel and \nEnergy Sector Transparency Initiative\u201d on 20 July 2010. Energy security through expansion of \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  vertically  integrated  power  company,  KyrgyzEnergo,  was  unbundled  into  (i)  Electric  Power  Plant  Company \n(generating  company),  (ii)  National  Electric  Grid  of  Kyrgyzstan  (transmission  company),  and  (iii)  four  distribution \ncompanies each responsible for a geographic area. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ngenerating  capacity  is  also  a  priority,  but  the  short-term  solutions  are  to  improve  system \nefficiency and reliability, and to increase regional power trade. The strategic vision of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Kyrgyz  power  sector  is  fully  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \nown strategy. The proposed project has the following components: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nAutomated  metering  and  data  acquisition  system.  The  automated  metering \nand  data  acquisition  system  (AMDA)  will  bring  transparency  to  wholesale \nelectricity transactions between the unbundled power companies, and to regional \npower  trade.  AMDA  will  eliminate  errors  and  rampant  manipulation  of  metering \ndata,  which  are  impossible  to  trace  with  the  current  archaic  technology. \nCommercial  loss  is  estimated  at  40%  of  total  system  loss.  Loss  reduction  will \nmake more power available domestically and improve the financial performance \nof  the  utilities.  Accurate  data  is  crucial  to  improving  commercial  performance. \nAMDA  will  also  support  regional  power  trade  through  (a)  meeting  the  CAPS \nmetering accuracy requirement, and (b) eliminating unauthorized exports. \n\nSubstation rehabilitation. Replacing dilapidated circuit breakers and instrument \ntransformers  that  have  reached  their  economic  lives,  are  technologically \nobsolete, or do not meet the accuracy requirement for regional power trade will \nimprove the reliability of the system. Since the Kyrgyz system is interconnected \nwith  the  CAPS,  rehabilitation  increases  reliability  of  the  regional  system  that \nunderpins regional power trade. \n\nCommunications and supervisory control and data acquisition system. This \ncomponent will link seven major substations (estimated) and the control centers \nvia optical fiber, enabling the system operator to dispatch more efficiently based \non real-time data. The supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) \nwill  reduce  technical  losses  by  avoiding  overload,  and  enable  faster  detection \nand  repair  of  faults.  The  system  improves  overall  efficiency  and  reliability  of \nKyrgyz power supply and the CAPS. \n\nStudy on the settlement mechanism for wholesale electricity transactions. \nThe objective is to look at the settlement system, and to recommend actions that \nadvance transparency and accountability, and to maximize the benefits of AMDA. \nThe component will devise mechanisms to improve the commercial performance \nof  the  utilities,  and  to  streamline  contractual  and  settlement  arrangements  for \nregional power trade.  \n\nCorporate  and  financial  management  capacity  building  for  the  National \nElectric Grid of Kyrgyzstan (NEGK).3 This will improve corporate management \nof  the  transmission  company  through  the  preparation  of  a  corporate  business \nplan,  including  the  review  of  investment  needs,  operation  and  maintenance \npractices, organizational reforms, internal control, asset revaluation, and cost of \ntransmission  service.  Financial  management  capacity  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  the  application  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and \nappropriate corporate accounting software.  \n\n                                                 \n3   NEGK is an open joint stock company established under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic. The government holds \n\n93.7% of the shares; the rest is traded on the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange and the Central Asian Stock Exchange. \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project fits with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.4 The latter focuses \n7. \non  energy  efficiency,  cutting  fossil  fuel  use,  energy  security,  energy  access,  and  regional \ncooperation. The project also promotes capacity development and governance. It is aligned with \nthe government's Country Development Strategy 2009\u20132011,5 which places high priority on the \nenergy  sector.  The  Joint  Country  Support  Strategy  2007\u20132010, 6  prepared  by  major \ndevelopment  partners  and  ADB,  supports  the  Country  Development  Strategy.  Although  the \nenergy sector was initially assigned to other donors, ADB decided to reengage in the sector to \ncontribute  to  the  large  financing  need.  The  project  forms  part  of  the  energy  strategy  agreed \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program. \n \nB. \n \nThe project will boost energy security, energy efficiency, and regional power trade. The \n8. \nimpact  will  be  stronger  reliability  of  the  national  and  regional  power  systems  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Central Asia. The outcome will be higher operational efficiency of the utilities. \n \nC. \n \n \n \nThe  AMDA  will  be  a  main  output.  It  will  allow  obtaining  commercial  metering  data \n9. \nautomatically  from  (i)  about  190  substations  of  NEGK,  and  (ii)  facilities  of  the  Electric  Power \nPlant  Company 7  with  direct  supply  to  distribution  companies  and  interconnections  with \nneighboring countries. A second output will be the rehabilitation of circuit breakers, and current \nand  voltage  transformers  in  over  50  selected  substations  of  NEGK.  A  third  output  will  be  the \nSCADA that links seven major NEGK substations (estimated) and control centers. \n \n \n \n10. \ninvestments; \n(ii) recommendations  on  the  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity  transactions \nincluding  the  industry  structure;  and  (iii)  development  of  NEGK's  corporate  and  financial \nmanagement capacities, and strategic business planning. \n \nD. \n\n(i)  project  management  of  physical \n\nThe  main  outputs  will  be: \n\nNonphysical \n\nPhysical \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $56 million (Table 1). \n\n11. \n \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2008.

The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \ndraft financing and project agreements. ADB will finance a total of $44.8 million equivalent. The \ngovernment will allocate $1.5 million to the Ministry of Energy (MOE) for advisory services on a \nwholesale  settlement  mechanism  and  NEGK\u2019s  capacity  building.  The  remaining  $43.3  million \nwill be relent to NEGK to fund capital investment and project management. The relending is for \na  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.5%  per  annum. \nForeign exchange risk will be borne by NEGK. The government and NEGK will contribute $11.2 \nmillion to the project (Table 2). The government will either (i) allocate additional funds from the \nbudget  to  cover  value-added  tax  and  custom  duties  accrued  on  project  expenditures,  or  (ii) \nexempt  the  project  from  such  taxes  and  duties,  in  which  case  the  amount  exempted  will \nconstitute  government  counterpart  financing.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).8  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \n\nADB \u2013 ADF \n\nGovernment/NEGK \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n44.8a \n11.2 \n\n56.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n80.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NEGK = National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan. \na  $28.1 million (62.7%) is ADF grant, and $16.7 million (37.3%) is ADF loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                                                 \n8  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n13. \nThe  project  has  two  executing  agencies:  MOE  and  NEGK.  MOE  is  responsible  for \n(i) managing  the  study  on  a  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity  transactions, \n(ii) managing  the  capacity-building  advisory  service  for  NEGK,  and  (iii)  supervising  NEGK's \nproject implementation performance.  \n \n14. \nNEGK  is  responsible  for  managing  the  capital  investment.  A  procurement  capacity \nassessment revealed that the country procurement system is weak and NEGK\u2019s capacity is also \nlimited. The existing project implementation unit (PIU) will oversee the execution of the capital \ninvestment,  but  project  management  will  be  outsourced  to  an  international  consulting  firm  to \nassist  NEGK.  Its  task  will  include  outline  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  bid \nevaluation,  contract  award,  construction  supervision,  accounting,  safeguard  monitoring,  and \nreporting  to  the  government  and  ADB.  Contractors\u2019  contracts  will  have  fixed  prices  and  fixed \ndelivery periods, with premiums and penalties on performance and quality.

The AMDA is a critical \ntechnology that brings transparency to the wholesale electricity market, and helps reduce loss \nand boost efficiency in commercial operations. The SCADA is a standard modern utility practice \nconsidered  appropriate  to  improve  NEGK\u2019s  system  operations.  The  obsolete  circuit  breakers \nand  instrument  transformers  need  to  be  replaced  with  modern  equipment  to  avoid  collapse  of \nthe power system. ADB has confirmed that NEGK has experience in successfully installing and \ncommissioning  similar  types  of  equipment  as  to  be  procured  under  the  project.  Stronger \nreliability will improve energy security and boost regional power trade. The AMDA and SCADA \nare a technological step change from the current practice. Training will be included in the project \nmanagement  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  and  contractors\u2019  contracts.  The  contracts  will \ninclude sufficient spare parts, support service, and quality and performance warranties. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nA  financial  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.9 All financial costs and benefits have been expressed at \nconstant  2009  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return\u2014\ncapital investment and operations and maintenance\u2014reflect the cost of delivering the estimated \nbenefits.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  7.83%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (0.65%).  Financial  viability  was  gauged  by  comparing  the \nincremental costs and benefits in \"with project\" and \"without project\" investment scenarios. The \nincremental  benefits  come  from  fewer  outages,  fewer  technical  and  commercial  losses,  and \nmore domestic and international sales.  \n \n17. \nThe  economic  viability  takes  into  account  streams  of  costs  and  benefits  resulting  from \nthe project. Regional economic benefits are not included in the economic internal rate of return \ncalculations since they accrue to countries other than the Kyrgyz Republic.  Other unquantifiable \nbenefits are lower operation and maintenance costs, more efficient dispatch based on reliable \nreal-time  data  and  historical  data,  better  water  management  at  Toktogul  HPP  through  loss \nreduction.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  24.41%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \n12% opportunity cost of capital.10  \n \nC. \n \n18. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEGK. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. ADF grant and loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  including  risk  management  assessment  was \n19. \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  also \nconducted.  Similar  to  the  country\u2019s  weak  public  financial  management,  NEGK\u2019s  financial \nmanagement capabilities are also weak. Internal control is lacking, and adherence to accounting \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n10  Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2). \n\n\ffinancial \nrequirement \nstandards,  disclosure,  and  auditing \nmanagement capabilities, corporate business planning, and development of human resources is \ncritical to improving corporate performance. \n \n20. \ngovernance in project-related activities, the project will include the following measures: \n \n\nTo  bolster  the  corporate  and  financial  management  capacities  of  NEGK  and  to  ensure \n\ninsufficient.  Building  up \n\nis \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nstrengthening the existing PIU and maintaining separate project accounts; \noutsourcing project management to an international consulting firm; \nestablishing  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants; \nhaving the project accounts audited by an external auditor; and    \ncontracting consultants to develop NEGK's corporate and financial management \ncapacities,  introduce  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and \nprepare a corporate business plan. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe general population will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power \nsector. Since the rural poor are the first to be cut off from supply during winter power shortages, \nsystem  loss  reduction  and  stronger  supply  reliability  will  particularly  benefit  the  poor  and  the \nsocially  excluded.  Advisory  services  funded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment will promote the establishment of an escrow account to ensure that revenue from \npower  exports  in  summer  will  be  used  to  purchase  fuel  for  stable  domestic  power  supply  in \nwinter.  The  project\u2019s  advisory  service  on  a  settlement  mechanism  for  wholesale  electricity \ntransactions will support efforts by the United States Agency for International Development.  \n \n22. \nThe investments take place in existing substations and transmission lines. There are no \nadverse social impacts except nominal crop compensation during installation of optical ground \nwire  (OPGW)  at  the  existing  transmission  towers.  Since  the  investments  only  require  minimal \ncivil works, an influx of workers is not expected.  \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe  geographic  coverage  is  national.  Physical  investments  are  limited  to  (i)  installing \nmeters  and  equipment  in  existing  substations,  and  (ii)  stringing  OPGW  over  existing \ntransmission  towers  and  laying  underground  optical  fiber  cables  under  public  roads  in  urban \nareas. An environmental and social safeguard specialist will be hired. \n \n24. \nEnvironment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).11 The major anticipated impact on \nthe  environment  will  come  from  the  disposal  of  electrical  equipment.  The  environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  of  the  initial  environmental  examination  requires  the \ntransformer oils to be treated in NEGK's oil treatment facility and reused. An official inventory on \nusage  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  does  not  exist.  The  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement plan provides guidance on PCB testing, and handling and disposal procedures in \ncase  it  is  identified.  The  project  will  work  closely  with  the  new  \u201cManagement  and  Disposal  of \nPCBs in Kyrgyzstan\u201d project of the United Nations Development Programme, which is the first of \nits kind in the Kyrgyz Republic. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a potent greenhouse gas, will be used \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n11 Initial Environmental Examination (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nin the new gas-insulated circuit breakers, but in small amounts. The contractor will be instructed \nto handle SF6 in accordance with international best practice. \n \n25. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  category  B. Project investments will be implemented mostly \nin  existing  substations  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  are  not \nenvisaged.  Work  space  and  access  is  required  only  for  stringing  OPGW  over  the  existing \ntransmission  towers  to  develop  a  modern  communication  system.  The  towers  are  mostly  on \nfarmland.  Very  limited  temporary  LAR  impact  such  as  crop  losses  during  installation  is \nexpected.  Since  the  exact  location  of  the  work  space  can  only  be  identified  during  detailed \ndesign  and  temporary  works  planning  by  the  turnkey  contractor,  a  LAR  framework  has  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Operations  Manual \nF1/OP.12 The  LAR  framework  has  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  turnkey  contractor\u2019s \ncontract  will  explicitly  state  that  a  LAR  plan  must  be  drafted  by  the  turnkey  contractor  in \naccordance  with  the  LAR  framework.  The  LAR  plan  will  be  finalized  by  the  PIU  and  project \nmanagement  consultants,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  endorsement.  On-site  installation  works \nshall not begin until the endorsed LAR plan is fully implemented. \n \n26. \nIndigenous  peoples  category  C.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous \npeoples  as  defined  under  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  covers  most  of  the \ncountry. The majority of the population is Kyrgyz; ethnic minorities comprise Kazakhs, Russians, \nand Uzbeks. These ethnic groups do not differ in their needs or levels of power supply, and all \nwill benefit equally from the project. \n \nF. \n \n27. \nTechnologies  adopted  under  the  project  conform  to  international  standards  and  best \npractices  that  are  commercially  proven  and  widely  used  across  the  world.  Technical  risks  are \nlow,  and  NEGK  has  experience  with  developing  and  maintaining  similar  rehabilitation  projects \nfunded  by  development  partners.  The  AMDA  and  SCADA  are  new  to  NEGK,  but  adequate \ntraining,  support  and  warranties  will  be  included  in  the  contractor\u2019s  contract.  Project \nmanagement  consultants  will  ensure  proper  implementation  with  regard  to  quality,  quantity, \ncost,  duration,  safety,  safeguards,  financial  management,  internal  control,  reporting,  and \nauditing. Capacity building at NEGK and inclusion of sufficient spare parts will mitigate operation \nand maintenance risk. \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.13  \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nInadequate \ncapacity of NEGK \n\nMitigating Measures \nA team of international consultants will be recruited to develop the corporate and \nfinancial  management  capacities  of  NEGK,  including  (i)  strategic  business \nplanning,  (ii)  financial  performance  and  controls;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening \nand  human  resources  development,  (iv)  management  information  system,  and \n(v) technical performance measurement. \n\n                                                 \n12  Resettlement  Framework  (Appendix  2);  and  ADB.  2010.
