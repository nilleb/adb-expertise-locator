I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 2 of the \nPromoting Economic Diversification Program (PED-SP2); and (iii) a proposed grant for capacity \ndevelopment  for  the  Competition,  Regulatory  Efficiency,  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Technology (CREST) Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.  \n \n2.  PED-SP2 will support the government\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at diversifying the \nsources of economic growth, supported by increased contribution of the private sector. The \nreform priorities include efforts to enhance governance in the business climate by promoting \ncompetition policy and regulatory efficiency. PED-SP2 also aims to increase private sector \ncompetitiveness  through  innovation  and  enhanced  trade  facilitation  measures.  The \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 3 and the Policy Matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Reforms to the business climate implemented under the National Strategic Development \nPlan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP) and sector strategies have helped Cambodia move up 15 places in the \nWorld Bank Group\u2019s Doing Business global rankings since 2006.1 Despite this progress, much \nneeds to be done to attract investment and generate better jobs for a rapidly expanding labor \nforce. As Cambodia\u2019s economy advances, new policy and structural challenges for the private \nsector need to be addressed. These include emerging competition policy issues in key sectors, \nthe high business compliance costs of regulations (estimated at 3%-5% of gross domestic \nproduct), low levels of innovative activity in the private sector, and the relatively high cost in \ntrade facilitation. Food safety is poor in Cambodia and this is a barrier to private sector growth \nand international trade in processed food products, which has huge growth potential. It is also a \nmajor  risk  to  the  human  population  and  lowers  productivity.  With  over  60,000  enterprises \nengaged in the food sector, reforming sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) management \nsystems is a critical part of the government\u2019s economic diversification strategy.2  \n \n4.  The PED cluster approved by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  in  December  2008  comprises  three  subprograms  from  2008  to  2012. 3  Under \nsubprogram 1 (PED-SP1), financed by ADB ($19 million) in 2008, the government implemented \na series of investment and trade facilitation measures that laid the foundations for a more \ncompetitive and diversified economy in the longer term. It also included the first SPS capacity \ndevelopment project (SPS-1 project) financed by ADB ($2 million). The current phase, PED-\nSP2, builds on progress made under PED-SP1 for investment climate, trade policy, and trade \nfacilitation. It also responds to new policy challenges arising from the impact of the global \nfinancial crisis such as the need for competition policy, regulatory efficiency, and innovation to \npromote private sector competitiveness. These reforms are designed to promote economic \ndiversification by (i) enhancing competition in domestic markets and lower cost regulation, \n(ii) strengthening  investor  confidence  in  the  regulatory  environment  and  promoting  market-\nbased innovation, and (iii) strengthening trade facilitation measures along the entire supply \n                                                 \n1  Kingdom of Cambodia. 2006.

Manila. ", "2   \nchain. ADB technical assistance has been targeted to support the government accomplish the \npolicy triggers under PED-SP2.4 The final phase, PED-SP3, is expected to be completed at the \nend of 2012. PED-SP3 includes 10 policy triggers building on progress made under PED-SP2. \n \n5.  PED-SP2  has  several  features  that  draw  on  best  international  practice  for  a \ncomprehensive trade and investment program. These include (i) supply-side incentives through \nimproving trade policy and taxation related to international norms, (ii) capacity development \nassistance  to  address  constraints  of  SPS  service  providers  to  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), (iii) addressing SMEs\u2019 demand-side issues through a pilot SPS technology \nmatching grants component, (iv) addressing issues of sustainability of reforms by establishing a \npermanent government body to oversee regulatory reforms, and (v) assisting Cambodia\u2019s global \nand regional integration efforts via support for Cambodia\u2019s World Trade Organization\u2019s trade \npolicy review (TPR) and its participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nregional trade agreements and ASEAN commitments to develop competition policy and law.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the PED cluster is an expanded and diversified private sector. By the end \nof 2015, the PED cluster is expected to have increased the share of nontraditional sectors in \nGDP and increased the share of non-garment exports in total exports of goods. The outcome of \nthe PED cluster will be an improved business environment where the private sector operates \nefficiently and effectively. This will be reflected in an increased number of registered enterprises \nand increased growth in private investment.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n7.  PED-SP2 supports the government\u2019s efforts in three core reform areas: (i) improving \ncompetition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency,  (ii)  strengthening  the  investment  climate  and \ninnovation, and (iii) enhancing trade policy and facilitation. All 20 policy measures required for \nPED-SP2 were carried out by the end of August 2010.5 \n \n1.  Output 1: Competition Policy and Regulatory Efficiency \n \n8.  PED-SP2 supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory environment for \nbusinesses. The objective is to promote greater competition in domestic markets and lower \nregulatory compliance costs faced by businesses. Critical reform areas include institutionalizing \ngood  practices  in  regulation  and  regulatory  impact  assessments  (RIAs).6 The  following \nmeasures toward achieving these objectives were completed before Board consideration of \nPED-SP2. \n \n9.  Institutionalizing  good  practice  in  regulation  making.  A  major  reform  is  the \ngovernment\u2019s program to institutionalize good regulatory practices in the national government. \nTo this end the government carried out the following steps (i) upgraded the Economic, Social \nand Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) at the Office of the Council of Ministers (OCM) with higher \nlevel policy status, increased personnel, and a broader policy mandate, including RIAs;7 and (ii) \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness. \nManila \n5  Policy Matrix (Appendix 4) and Assessment of Subprogram 2 Policy Triggers (Appendix 2). \n6  An RIA is both a process and record of the steps carried out by the regulator in preparing new legislation or \nregulations. The regulator will provide a regulatory impact statement on major proposals. The statement will assess \nthe impact of the proposal on the business community and record stakeholder consultations.   \n7  ECOSOCC is one of the councils in the OCM. Its key function is to review all proposed legislation and sub-decrees \nprior to submission to cabinet for consideration. It also provides economic advice to the OCM. See ADB. \n(forthcoming). Cambodia: Options for Institutionalizing Regulatory Impact Assessments. Manila.  ", "    3 \n \nthe government (OCM) produced and endorsed a strategy to institutionalize RIAs in the national \ngovernment, including preparation for and establishment of the Office of Regulatory Impact \nAssessment (ORIA) at ECOSOCC, which will oversee the RIA reforms. The OCM legal decision \nto establish the ORIA has been issued. The ORIA will be a permanent government body, \nmodeled on institutional approaches used in other countries such as the Australian Office of \nBest Practice Regulation and the United Kingdom\u2019s Office of Better Regulatory Practice. The \nORIA  will  comprise  18 professional  staff  qualified  in  economics,  accounting,  business \nadministration, and public administration. Recent graduates will fill a proportion of the positions. \nWith ADB technical assistance the government undertook activities to build RIA practice and \nraise awareness of its benefits in government: (i) the Ministry for Industry, Mines and Energy \n(MIME) implemented the first pilot RIA action plan starting with the Department of Industry; (ii) \nthe Ministry of Environment (MOE) prepared and endorsed its RIA action plan and initiated an \nRIA reviewing the cost of business compliance with a sub-decree; and (iii) the government in \ncollaboration  with  ADB  and  other  development  partners  undertook  several  RIA  awareness \nraising  activities  including  workshops,  a  senior  executive  retreat,  an  exposure  visit  to  the \nAustralian federal and state government offices of best practice regulation, and a red tape \nsurvey of enterprises.8 \n \n10.  Competition law. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) established a working group on \ncompetition policy responsible for raising awareness of its benefits and drafting a competition \nlaw under PED-SP3. ADB technical assistance will support the MOC to draft the competition law \nbased on best regional practices, including the establishment of an administratively autonomous \ncompetition council. This is in line with ASEAN member states\u2019 commitments to introduce \ncompetition policy and law by 2015.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Investment Climate \n \n11.  PED-SP2  supports  the  government\u2019s  goals  of  improving  the  investment  climate  by \nenhancing the investment incentives, investor protection, and promoting innovation and access \nto technology. Measures accomplished before Board consideration of PED-SP2 include the \nfollowing:  (i) the  government  (General  Department  of  Tax  at  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance [MEF]) started to build capacity for preparing for discussions on double tax agreements \nwith major trading partners\u2014including preparing a draft double tax agreement (DTA) model as \nthe basis for future DTA negotiations since the government is expected to begin discussions \nwith a regional trading partner for a DTA in 2011; (ii) Cambodia strengthened investor protection \nthrough investment chapters of regional agreements, including the agreement establishing the \nASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand free trade area (February 2009), ASEAN\u2013People\u2019s Republic of \nChina free trade area (August 2009), and ASEAN\u2013Republic of Korea free trade area (June \n2009);  (iii)  the  government  recognizes  that  Cambodia\u2019s  low  rankings  in  global  surveys  of \ntechnology adoption and innovation are a constraint to enhancing competitiveness\u2014to address \nthis, the MIME established a taskforce on national technology policy and produced a draft \nstrategic policy framework for technology and innovation for the SMEs sector.   \n \n3.  Output 3: Trade Policy and Facilitation \n \n12.  PED-SP2 supports the government\u2019s goals of continuing trade policy reforms to lower \nthe cost of doing business for the private sector, and implementing measures to improve trade \nfacilitation (customs and SPS) for enhanced competitiveness. The following measures were \naccomplished before Board consideration of PED-SP2.  \n \n                                                 \n8 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \n13.  Continuing trade policy reforms. The MOC produced a draft bill on trade remedies \nconsistent with best international practice and an economy-wide perspective. It is expected to \nbe submitted to the National Assembly in 2011. With ADB technical assistance, the government \nstarted preparations for its first TPR under the World Trade Organization (WTO) process. The \nTPR will provide a review of Cambodia\u2019s trade and investment policies, and this will help the \ngovernment prioritize policy reforms. Substantial progress has been made and the TPR is \nscheduled  to  be  completed  in  November  2011.  The  Department  of  Notification  and  Legal \nCompliance (WTO department) at the MOC strengthened its notification systems within the \ndepartment as the WTO focal point, Camcontrol as the inquiry point for SPS, and the MIME for \ntechnical barriers to trade. The WTO department started submitting notifications to the WTO in \n2009. This enhances transparency in the trade policy regime related to technical barriers to \ntrade. \n \n14.  Customs reforms. The government has made substantial progress in implementing \ncustoms reforms since 2008, critical to improving trade facilitation at the border. Under PED-\nSP2,  two  priority  measures  were  taken  to  improve  customs  facilitation:  (i)  the  General \nDepartment of Customs and Excise implemented and operationalized an automated system for \ncustoms data (ASYCUDA) at three major ports; as part of the customs system expansion \nproject, the General Department of Customs and Excise undertook a needs assessment for \nnational rollout of ASYCUDA, expected to commence in 2011; and (ii) the General Department \nof  Customs  and  Excise  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing  customs  transaction \nvaluation (CTV) in line with WTO commitments, including establishing the transaction valuation \nresearch unit responsible for overseeing CTV implementation, and a private sector forum to \nmonitor CTV implementation and provide inputs to implementation of CTV.   \n \n15.  Improvement of sanitary and phytosanitary standard management systems. The \ngovernment undertook measures to strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework for \neffective SPS (food safety) management systems. First, it produced draft interministerial prakas  \n(regulation) delineating the legal and enforcement responsibilities of various ministries (MOC, \nMIME, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries). The \nprakas is  expected to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will lay the foundations for an \neffective  SPS  regulatory  and  enforcement  coordination  mechanism  to  address  agency \nduplication in the SPS field. Second, the MIME developed, endorsed, and started implementing \nan action plan to commercialize the Industrial Laboratory Center of Cambodia (ILCC) by 2013. \nThe  plan  covers  corporate  governance,  strengthening  the  technical  capacity  of  staff,  and \nmeasures for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) accreditation for major food \nsafety tests.9 Third, satisfactory progress has been made in developing the Institute Standards \nCambodia Conformity and Assessment Board for management and process standards. It is \nintended to have the ISC accredited as a Conformity and Assessment Board in early 2011. This \nwill allow it to certify internationally recognized standards. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n16.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan of SDR6,565,000 \n($10 million equivalent) and an Asian Development Fund grant of $9 million to help finance \nPED-SP2. The $10 million loan equivalent will have 24-year term, including a grace period of \n8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. The \n                                                 \n9  With assistance from ADB and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the ILCC will be ISO17025 \naccredited with the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia for six microbiology tests expected in the \nfourth quarter of 2010. This means the ILCC\u2019s certified tests will be internationally accepted. The ILLC will be the \nfirst Cambodian laboratory to be ISO17025 accredited.  ", "    5 \n \ngovernment will meet the remaining resource requirement. The proceeds of the program loan \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.10 PED-SP2 will provide for the \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan and grant \neffectiveness. ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds and to \nverify the accuracy of the withdrawal application certification. \n \n17.  The size of the PED-SP2 loan is based on consideration of a number of factors required \nto support implementation of program reforms. The key considerations include: (i) the relative \nimportance of the sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program, and the \nleverage necessary to counter resistance from interest groups; (ii) the policy adjustment costs \nincurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing and complying with reforms; and \n(iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement from the country partnership \nstrategy period.11 ADB staff estimates that the long-run benefits of the reform program are \napproximately 2.9% of GDP or over $300.5 million (in 2009 prices). These economic benefits \ninclude increased output and investment from a reduction in business costs of compliance with \nlicensing, lower trade facilitation costs, and increased productivity due to lower incidence of food \nand water related diseases and premature mortality in the human population. The reforms have \nimportant distributive effects. It will increase employment and wages, with positively impacting \nfemale employment, simulated to rise by 4.7% from these reforms. The policy adjustment costs \nto the government and private sector are conservatively estimated as a discounted present \nvalue lump sum of $31.5 million (or $19.5 million without the present value lump sum).12 These \nadjustment costs include the administrative, enforcement and fiscal costs to the government in \nimplementing and enforcing the reforms (estimated at $26.0 million or alternatively $14 million \nwithout present value lump sum estimates)\u2014such as the investment cost to set up the ORIA at \nOCM including new staff and operating costs, investment costs to set up RIA units at line \nministries, the rollout of the ASYCUDA to three customs posts during PED-SP2, the investment \ncosts in implementing the action plan to commercialize the ILCC, restructuring costs at the ISC \nto be accredited as a conformity and assessment body, and costs involved in drafting legislation \nand the TPR process. The policy adjustment costs also include the increased business costs of \ncompliance with the SPS reforms related to mandatory SPS-sensitive standards (conservatively \nestimated at $5.5 million).13 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The MOC will be the executing agency for the PED-SP2. It will be responsible for the \noverall  implementation  of  PED-SP2,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration, and maintenance of program records. The implementation arrangements under \nPED-SP1 will continue under PED-SP2. The MOC will use the Private Sector Development \nSub-Steering Committee, chaired by the minister of commerce and comprising senior officials \nfrom  the  MEF  and  MIME.  The  steering  committee  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementation and sustaining policy actions, with MOC and relevant line agencies involved in \nsupporting  the  program  (MIME,  MOE,  and  ECOSOCC).  The  steering  committee  will  meet \nquarterly to monitor progress and oversee implementation of the program. The MOC will be \nresponsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and will report on implementation \nprogress. The MOC will also establish a program implementation unit (PIU), and assign a PIU \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1998.

To support PED-SP2 implementation, the government requested ADB to provide a grant \nfor capacity development in the CREST project. The CREST project will be funded under a \ngrant of $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The project duration will be 2011\u2013\n2014 (about 3 years). The CREST project will comprise two subprojects. The first subproject will \nbe the RIA subproject, which will focus on capacity development to institutionalize RIA in \ngovernment, including establishing the ORIA, supporting line ministries to implement RIA action \nplans, and developing a community of practitioners in RIA and regulatory reform. The project \nadministration manual (PAM) for the RIA subproject contains details of the implementation \narrangements, accounting and reporting, and other operational issues.14  \n \n20.  The second subproject is the SPS-2 subproject (the second phase of the SPS-1 project \nunder PED-SP1), which will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of supply side provisioning of \nSPS services to the private sector and the demand side for SPS services and technologies. A \nspecial feature of the SPS-2 subproject is a matching grants component to assist SMEs access \ntechnology and upgrade product and process quality. The PAM for the SPS-2 contains details of \nthe implementation arrangements, accounting and reporting, and other operational issues.15   \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $5,430,000, of which $5,000,000 will be grant financed \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  government  counterpart  in-kind  funding  is \n$430,000.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ECOSOCC  in  the  Council  of  Ministers  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  RIA \nsubproject.  Participating  line  ministries  (MIME,  MOC,  MOE,  and  at  least  one  other  line \nministry/agency)  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.16 The  ORIA  within  ECOSOCC  will  be \nmandated to implement RIA throughout all government operations. It will be responsible for \n(i) coordinating  subproject  implementation  with  the  implementing  agencies,  (ii)  carrying  out \nadministrative and fiduciary support, and (iii) supporting both government and ADB reporting \nrequirements on the progress of the subproject. A PIU will be established within the executing \nagency. Given the large volume of activities (workshops, seminars, etc.), the advance payment \nfacility will be used for procurement of goods and services. \n \n23.  The MIME will be the executing agency for the SPS-2 subproject. The MOC and the \nMinistry of Health will be the implementing agencies. The MIME will use the private sector \ndevelopment sub-steering committee on manufacturing and SMEs which will be responsible for \ncoordinating the implementation and sustaining the subproject.  A PIU will be established within \nthe executing agency. Given the large volume of activities (workshops, seminars, matching \ngrants, etc.), the advance payment facility will be used for procurement of goods and services. \n \n24.  At  the  request  and  on  behalf  of  the  government,  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the \nconsultants and administer the consultancy contracts of the two subprojects in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. This arrangement continues the one established for the \nSPS-1 project. The justification for ADB administration of the two subprojects is to overcome the \ngovernance problem of agency duplication in the SPS sector, and to ensure that both SPS and \nRIA priorities and reforms are synchronized across a wide range of agencies (footnotes 13 and \n14).  \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe two subproject PAMs. Two firms will be engaged to implement the activities under the two \nsubprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time), in addition to the standard procedures for the executing agency-\nadministered expenditures to be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                 \n16 The fourth line ministry will be selected by the ORIA based on criteria agreed with ADB, including agencies \nundertaking significant regulation activities.  \n ", "8   \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects   Arrangements \n  RIA Subproject  SPS-2 Subproject \nImplementation period  From March 2011 to March 2014  From March 2011 to March 2014 \nEstimated completion date  September 2014  September 2014 \nManagement     \n(i) Oversight body  ORIA  SPS interministerial committee \n(ii) Executing agency  ECOSOCC   MIME \n(iii) Key implementing  MIME, MOC, MOE, and one other (footnote 18)  MOC (Camcontrol) and MOH \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit   ORIA \u2013 (18 staff)  12 staff \nConsulting services  Firm selection based on QCBS  Firm selection based on QCBS  \n(Two international consultants, 1 senior project  (Four international consultants and 4 \nadministrator, and 1 national project administrator  national consultants [70 person-\n[66 person-months])  months]) \nFive national consultants through ICS (120 person-\nmonths) \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting  Advance contracting \nDisbursement  ADB administered through firm and individual  ADB administered through firm \nconsultant engagements  engagement  \n($2,100,00) a  ($2,200,000) \nExecuting agency imprest account \u2013total of  Executing agency imprest account for \n$300,000 commencing in the first year of the  management of half of the matching \nproject.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n26.  The  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  have  been  assessed  to  improve  the \nunderstanding  of  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  fiduciary  arrangements  for  PED-SP2.  This \nassessment was based on the sector work of ADB\u2019s public financial management for rural \ndevelopment  program  cluster,  as  well  as  the  Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public \nExpenditure Review for 2003 and the Country Procurement Assessment for 2004, both led by \nWorld Bank.17 These assessments identified core areas to address with development partners\u2019 \nsupport. The Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review determined that \nthe fiduciary risk in the use and management of public funds was high. As a consequence, the \ngovernment developed and began implementing a medium-term public financial management \nreform  program  from  2004  to  2015,  supported  by  development  partners.  This  program \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008.

ADB, the World Bank, and other development \npartners are working closely with the government to implement improved public sector financial \nmanagement  systems.  A  good  governance  framework  for  the  CREST  project  has  been \ndeveloped and agreed with the executing agencies (footnotes 13 and 14).  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the PAMs.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social  \n \n28.  Reforms under the PED-SP2 could reduce poverty by 2.0 percentage points.18  PED-\nSP2 will contribute to a sustainable reduction in poverty through three channels. The first \nchannel is through higher, broad-based and sustainable economic growth. By reducing the \nbusiness compliance costs with the business licensing system, lowering trade facilitation costs, \nimproving taxation and investor guarantees in line with international norms, private and foreign \ninvestment will increase across a broad range of sectors thereby supporting higher economic \ngrowth. The improvement is SPS management systems will aid government\u2019s efforts to develop \nbackward linkages with the agriculture sector. The second channel is through the labor market \nwith increased real wages and hiring activity across most sectors from increased investment. \nThe lower risk of food and water borne diseases in the human population will raise productivity \nand  improve  household  incomes.  The  third channel  is through  lower  prices  of  goods  and \nservices. By improving transparency in trade policy, increased integration within the region and \nthe rest of the world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, and implementing competition \npolicy, domestic prices will fall through greater competition in the economy. PED-SP2 will have \na positive impact on achieving the goal of gender equality through gender mainstreaming in the \nregulatory review process and equitable access of female entrepreneurs to the matching grants \noutput under the SPS-2 subproject.19 \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n29.  PED-SP2  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \nand will be incorporated into the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations, and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any \nsuch investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all \nrelevant books and records, as may be necessary, for the satisfactory completion of any such \ninvestigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The  assumptions  underlying  PED-SP2  include  the  following:  (i)  external  economic \nenvironment continues to improve to support domestic macroeconomic stability and growth, and \n(ii) the government will stay on course with key business regulatory reform measures. However, \nthere are three main risks to PED-SP2 (Table 4). \n                                                 \n18 Summary Program Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMacroeconomic instability  The government is undertaking measures to consolidate fiscal policy.
