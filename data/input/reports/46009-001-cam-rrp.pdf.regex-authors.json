THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, \nboth to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project.1 \n \n2.  The project includes four outputs to restore key infrastructure damaged by the 2011 \nfloods that affected 18 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces: (i) national and provincial road restoration, \n(ii)  rural  roads  restoration,  (iii)  irrigation  and  flood  control,  and  (iv)  project  and  flood \nmanagement. The project covers six severely flood-affected provinces: Banteay Meanchey, \nBattambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The 2011 floods. The Mekong River water level started to rise beyond normal levels in \nearly August 2011, with the water level rising significantly when typhoons Nesat and Nalgae \nbrought exceptionally heavy rain in late September and early October 2011, respectively. Some \n18  provinces  and  municipalities  were  subsequently  inundated  and  over  1.7  million  people \naffected. The immediate direct social impacts on the affected community were devastating. The \nfloods caused the death of 250 people and, overall, more than 350,000 households were \naffected; almost 270,000 houses were flooded of which 1,297 were damaged; about 405,000 \nhectares (ha) of rice crops were affected of which almost 230,000 ha were severely damaged or \ndestroyed  (9.3%  of  the  cultivated  area);  1,675 livestock  were  lost,  and  more  than  70,000 \ndrinking water wells were contaminated. \n \n4.  Damage and loss assessment. A number of partial assessments of the impacts of the \n2011 floods have been carried out by the Government of Cambodia and development partners.2 \nHowever, no agency took the lead role in preparing a comprehensive post-disaster needs \nassessment. To fill this gap, a preliminary damage and loss assessment3 was carried out by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). ADB also supported a post-flood household survey jointly with \nother  development  agencies  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  floods  on  rural  communities.4 \nTogether,  these  two  initiatives  supported  the  identification  of  geographical  focus  and  the \nselection of subprojects.  \n  \n5.  Infrastructure damage. The damage to public infrastructure includes roads (national, \nprovincial,  and  rural);  irrigation  and  water  resources  facilities;  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities (mostly small-scale rural); schools; and health centers. The preliminary damage and \nloss assessment estimated damage to infrastructure at $376 million along with $35 million of \nlosses caused by loss of connectivity and access to markets. In the social sectors, the estimate \nfor damages is $35 million. In agriculture, the impacts of the floods, mainly on rice, were $40 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 2011. Kingdom of Cambodia: Evaluation of \nPost-Flood Needs Assessment Data. Phnom Penh.  \n3  Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  The in-depth post-flood household assessment measures food security, nutrition, health, and livelihood indicators \namong a representative sample of flood-affected households. In addition to ADB, the survey is supported by: \nAction Aid, DanChurchAid, Danish Red Cross, Save the Children, United Nations Children's Fund, and World Food \nProgram. The findings of the assessment will guide decisions for early recovery targeting and response, with the \nfinal report expected in April 2012. ", "2 \n \nmillion of damages and $139 million of losses (largely of paddy rice). The 2011 floods caused \nan estimated $451 million in damages and $174 million in losses.5 \n \n6.  Flood emergency response management. In line with ADB\u2019s guidelines for emergency \nassistance, the need for improvement of the government\u2019s capacity to prepare for and manage \ndisasters was considered.6 The main agency responsible for disaster management in Cambodia \nis the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), chaired by the Prime Minister and \ncomprising  all  involved  government  agencies. Many  development  partners  and  institutions, \nincluding ADB, are involved in various aspects of flood management. ADB has provided support \nto the NCDM under the Emergency Food Assistance Project7 to build capacity to respond to \nfood emergencies through enhancing the information system, and to the Ministry of Water \nResources and Meteorology under the Water Resources Management Sector Development \nProgram8 to promote integrated water resource management and adaptation to climate change. \nThe proposed Greater Mekong Subregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation \nProject  aims  to  strengthen  flood  management  capacity  by  addressing  structural  and \nnonstructural measures, including assisting the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology to \nestablish the National Flood Forecasting Center, and strengthening capacity for community-\nbased disaster risk management.  \n \n7.  Strengthening  future  flood  and  disaster  risk  management.  Given  the  need  to \nstrengthen flood and disaster management capacities in Cambodia9, additional flood-support \nfunding from a trust fund is being considered to develop a disaster management program, \nseparate from but complementary to the project. The proposed activities will strengthen the \nNCDM\u2019s capacity to harness the resources and expertise of the relevant line ministries and \nother organizations, and provide a robust approach for prevention, mitigation, and preparedness \nto  manage  future  floods.  The  activities  will  also  include  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement programs, targeting at-risk communities at district, commune, and village levels in \nareas covered under the project.10 \n \n8.  Complementary project resources. ADB has been able to identify existing projects \nthat can be adjusted to address the emergency. Specifically, ADB will: (i) assist with restoration \nof rural water supply facilities under the ongoing Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project,11 (ii) restore some irrigation schemes within the Northwest Irrigation Sector \n                                                \n5  More details on the damages by sector are in Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  A review of the organization and management of resources, roles, and responsibilities to deal with all phases of a \nnatural disaster, preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as ongoing or planned projects in the emergency \nassistance area is in Emergency Management during Natural Disasters in Cambodia (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2008.

Government\u2019s response. The government allocated about $40 million of budgetary \nresources to flood damage in 2011, and plans to allocate an additional $90 million in 2012. \nThese  funds  are  being  allocated  in  close  collaboration  with  the  respective  line  ministries, \ndevelopment partners, and civil society. \n \n10.  Consultation and coordination. The project has been closely coordinated with other \ndevelopment  partners  involved  in  flood  relief  and  rehabilitation  activities.16   Civil  society \nrepresentatives were also consulted. \n \n11.  Flood  impact  response  framework.  As  a  framework  for  structuring  the  proposed \nproject activities, the restoration of flood-damaged infrastructure is divided into three stages: \n(i)  Stage 1: Immediate repairs to reestablish use of the infrastructure and restore \nminimum functioning  levels.  The most  urgent work  was  implemented  by  the \ngovernment using its own resources in the immediate aftermath of the floods. \n(ii)  Stage  2:  Fast-track  repairs  where  it  is  necessary  to  substantially  repair  the \ndamage before the next wet season (June\u2013July 2012), to secure the existing \n(undamaged) works and avoid more extensive damage during the rains. Urgent \npreparation of stage 2 packages has been the emphasis of the line ministries. \n(iii)  Stage 3: Remaining flood damage restoration to complete the remaining damage \nrepairs within the following two dry season construction periods. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the project is economic and social recovery from the 2011 floods in project \nprovinces. The outcome of the project is the restoration of critical public and social infrastructure \nassets to their original standards or better.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Given the extent of the infrastructure damage and the limited resources available, the \nproposed project prioritizes specific areas and sectors. \n \n14.  National and provincial road restoration. The project will reconstruct flood-damaged \nnational and provincial roads in four provinces. In Prey Veng, 2 kilometers (km) of a ring road, \nwhich also serves as a flood protection dyke for Prey Veng City,17 will be strengthened, and five \nbridges along National Road No. 11 that were severely weakened by the floods will be replaced \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2003.

In Banteay Meancheay, Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces, 72 km of \nprovincial roads will be repaired and upgraded, and one bridge replaced. The works will be \ncarried  out  in  three  stages.  Temporary  stage  1  work  has  already  been  completed  under \ngovernment funding to restore minimum function of the roads. Stage 2 is urgent work that needs \nto  be  fast-tracked,  with  substantial  works  done  during  the  2012  dry  season,  to  secure \nfunctioning  of  the  roads  during  the  2012  wet  season.  Stage  3  works  will  be  prepared  to \ncommence after the 2012 wet season. \n \n15.  Rural roads restoration. The project will reconstruct about 450 km of flood-damaged \nrural roads in five provinces: Banteay Meancheay, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey \nVeng,  and  Siem  Reap.  Reconstruction  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  in  three stages; the \ngovernment has already completed stage 1. During stage 2, project roads will be repaired to \nfacilitate immediate access by reshaping the road section and providing a 100\u2013150 millimeter \nlaterite overlay, before the rains in 2012. During stage 3, road sections will be strengthened to \nprotect against future flood damage, with cross-drainage facilities and paving of laterite or \ndouble bituminous surface treatment. Under this output, a demonstration exercise relating to \nlabor-intensive construction and maintenance of rural roads will be carried out.18 \n \n16.  Irrigation  and  flood  control.  Under  this  output,  about  26 flood-damaged  irrigation \nschemes covering about 25,000 ha19 will be repaired in at least five provinces: Battambang, \nKampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap. Since flood restoration work for \nirrigation schemes often involves relatively small works to restore full operation, it is proposed \nthat  schemes  in  other  provinces  may  also  be  considered  depending  on  the  detailed \nassessments during implementation, subject to agreement of the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF, the executing agency) and ADB. Stage 1 works involved temporary measures \nduring 2011, mainly using sand bags and pumps to restore irrigation as far as possible. It is \nproposed to complete relatively small-scale stage 2 works before the 2012 wet season in \n19 schemes to restore most of the irrigation operations, and to secure undamaged works for the \nnext wet season. Stage 3 covers works that require more detailed investigations, and this work \nwill commence after the 2012 wet season. \n \n17.  Project and flood management. This output will support the MEF to undertake overall \noversight and management of the project. It will be supported by consultants to ensure that \nprocedures are followed and that implementation schedules are kept on track. This output will \nalso provide consulting and capacity development inputs to link the restoration outputs under \nthe project with support for flood management activities (para. 7). \n \n   \n                                                \n18 The approach to promoting labor intensity (where feasible) will follow the principles of the public works component \nof Cambodia\u2019s 2011 National Social Protection Strategy for the Poor and Vulnerable. The approach to improving \nmaintenance  of  the  rural  roads  will  draw  from  the  ongoing  related  activities  of  ADB.  2010.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).23 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2012\u2013March 2015 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Management Coordination Committee \nChair: Ministry of Economy and Finance; members: Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of \nWater Resources and Meteorology \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing  Ministry of Public Works and Transport for output 1 \nagencies  Ministry of Rural Development for output 2  \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology for output 3 \n(iv)  Implementation units  Phnom Penh, PCMU: 10 staff, PIU (3): 14 staff each plus 1 site \nengineer or provincial focal point in each project province \nProcurement  International competitive  4 contracts  $23.60 million \nbidding \nNational competitive bidding  13 contracts  $19.19 million \nDirect contract  16 contracts  $19.29 million \nShopping  9 contracts  $0.12 million \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  156 person-months  $0.64 million  \nSingle source selection  756 person-months  $5.18 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  For eligible expenditures incurred after 30 September 2011, but not \nadvance contracting  earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan agreement or grant \nagreement, and to a maximum of 30% of the loan and grant amounts \nDisbursement  The ADB loan and AusAID grant proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, PCMU = project \ncoordination and monitoring unit, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21.  Advance action and retroactive financing. Given that works under stage 2 generally \nneed to commence before the expected date of loan effectiveness in April 2012, and to ensure \nthat project activities commence in a timely manner, the government has requested the use of \nretroactive financing for consulting services and stage 2 procurement packages.24 Retroactive \nfinancing is considered essential to finance the repair or rehabilitation of certain critical facilities \nbefore  the  next  flooding  season.  Retroactive  financing  can  apply  to  eligible  expenditures \nincurred after 30 September 2011, but not earlier than 12 months before the date of the loan \nagreement  or  grant  agreement,  provided  that  the  project  coordination  and  monitoring  unit \n(PCMU), assisted by the project consultants, certifies the expenditures, and that the certification \nis acceptable to ADB. The government has been advised that approval of advance action and/or \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the project. \n                                                \n23 Detailed  implementation  arrangements,  including  terms  of  references  of  all  agencies,  are  in  the  Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Details on procedures for retroactive financing and advance actions are in the PAM (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \n \n \n22.  Procurement. For stage 3 subprojects, expected to commence works following the next \nrainy season in October 2012, competitive procurement procedures will be followed for all \nproject packages. Civil works packages of less than $3,500,000 may be procured using national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) and, for larger packages, international competitive bidding will be \nused. The first subproject to be carried out under stage 3 by each implementing agency under \noutputs  1\u20133  following  NCB  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB  before \ncommencing. Subsequent NCB packages over $1,000,000 will be submitted to ADB for prior \nreview and approval. Procurement packages valued at less than $1,000,000 will be sent to the \nPCMU for endorsement and to ADB for post-approval. \n \n23.  Consulting services. Consultant support will be provided under the project to support \nthe  PCMU25 and the  three  implementing  agencies.  Under  outputs  1\u20133 of the  project,  one \ninternational consulting firm, in association with national consulting firms, will assist each of the \nthree implementing agencies. The international firms will be engaged through single source \nselection in the respective sectors to provide the necessary services. Individual consultants (two \ninternational  and  two  national)  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PCMU  under  output  4.26 All \nengagement of consultants under ADB financing will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). As requested by \nthe MEF, ADB will assist the government in selecting individual consultants for the PCMU. \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  PCMU  will  establish  the  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system within 6 months of loan effectiveness using the targets, \nindicators, assumptions, and risks in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The \ndata will be disaggregated by income levels, gender, and ethnicity. Further, the PCMU will \nmonitor and ensure compliance with loan assurances: policy, legal, financial, safeguards, and \ngender. The midterm review will also be held to examine whether the project implementation is \nin line with the project objective and scope. Further details are provided in the PAM. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic and financial assessments will be undertaken for all subprojects under the \ninvestment packages in stage 3. Economic analysis of flood projects focuses on future losses \navoided and, through restoring basic infrastructure and improving connectivity, such projects will \nimprove the welfare of affected people and businesses. They will also directly generate jobs and \nincomes through reconstruction activities. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  The public financial management system is being developed, but is still inadequate to \nachieve accountability in public expenditures.27 The government has implemented the Public \n                                                \n25 Advance Actions for the Flood Damage Emergency Reconstruction Project (TA 8051-CAM), for $225,000, has \nbeen mobilized to provide consulting support for (i) advance actions in the areas of procurement, (ii) technical and \nengineering services to fill gaps in the resources already available, (iii) consulting services to support the \npreparation of various elements of the Report and Recommendation of the President, and (iv) consulting services \nrequired to prepare the preliminary damage and loss assessment. \n26 Complete details of the terms of reference of the consulting firms are in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n27 The assessments of public financial management, procurement, and anticorruption efforts draw on ADB. 2011. \nCambodia: Country Governance Risk Assessment Report and Risk Management Plan. Manila. \n ", "8 \n \nFinancial Management Reform Program since 2004.28 The procurement assessment, drawing \non procurement diagnostic studies, indicates limited recent progress. The Public Procurement \nLaw, January 2012 and the Anti-Corruption Law, 2010 strengthen sanctions, but these laws \nhave  just  been  adopted.  The  government\u2019s  Standard  Operating  Procedures,  Procurement \nManual, and Financial Management Manual for Externally Assisted Projects have been applied \nto  ADB-financed  projects,  and  are  being  updated  under  ADB  support.  The  anticorruption \nassessment identifies important legislative and institutional developments, and stresses these \nhave achieved initial results. Important legislative developments include penalty provisions in \nthe 2008 Public Finance Law, strengthening the Penal Code for corrupt offenses, 2009, and \npassing the Anti-Corruption Law, 2010. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and the implementing agencies. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  Poverty  reduction.29 The  floods  affected  a  number  of  the  poorest  provinces  in \nCambodia. The project is geographically targeted to the areas most in need and with a high \nconcentration  of  poverty.  The  household  survey  carried  out  jointly  with  other  development \npartners will assist in measuring the poverty impacts of the flood on rural communities. The \ndesign  incorporates  features  that  will  help  reduce  poverty  both  directly  and  indirectly.  In \nrehabilitating damaged road and irrigation infrastructure, the direct poverty reduction impact will \ncome from the provision of short-term employment and much-needed cash income to poor \nwomen and men using labor-intensive approaches where appropriate. The repaired and, in \nsome cases, upgraded road and irrigation infrastructure will indirectly reduce poverty by helping \nto restore livelihoods and reduce vulnerability by improving physical access to markets and \nsocial services as well as by increasing agricultural productivity. \n \n28.  Gender equity. Pre-existing gender inequalities have likely worsened in the aftermath of \nthe floods and will deteriorate further unless women\u2019s participation in the reconstruction is \nensured. The project includes a Labor and Gender Action Plan (LGAP)30 to ensure women\u2019s \naccess to project benefits, mostly through their participation in the labor force recruited to \nreconstruct and maintain the infrastructure. Equal pay for equal work will be guaranteed. Social \ndevelopment and gender consultants will be hired to support each implementing agency in \nimplementing and monitoring the LGAP, which focuses on stage 3 activities. ADB\u2019s Cambodia \nResident Mission\u2019s gender specialist will support LGAP implementation. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Environment. The project is classified category B for environment. Subprojects will \nreconstruct  existing  transport  and  irrigation  infrastructure.  Subproject  selection  criteria  are \nformulated to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts. An environmental assessment \n                                                \n28 This takes a multi-platform approach. Each platform is built on achievements of the earlier one. Platform 1 \nintroduced  budget  credibility;  platform  2  strengthens  accountability  and  internal  control,  particularly  in  line \nministries; platform 3 improves linkage between policy priorities and budget planning; and platform 4 strengthens \nintegration of accountability and review processes for both financial and performance management.

", "9 \n \nand  review  framework  (EARF)31 was  prepared  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws and sub-decrees. The EARF includes \nenvironmental guidelines to avoid and minimize adverse impacts during the identification and \nfinalization  of  subprojects.  Implementation  arrangements  in  the  PCMU  and  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  build  on  experience  gained  from  ADB-financed  projects,  and \nadequate capacity is ensured to manage environmental impacts through consultant support and \nadditional capacity building. Initial environmental examinations and environmental management \nplans will be prepared consistent with the EARF and will be incorporated into bidding and \ncontract  documents  to  be  implemented  by  contractors  and  monitored  by  the  PIUs. \nEnvironmental reporting to ADB from the PCMU will be done on a semiannual basis. \n \n30.  Social. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C \nfor indigenous peoples. Subproject selection criteria are formulated to avoid land acquisition, \nresettlement  impacts,  and  social  risks.32 A  resettlement  framework33 was  prepared  and \ndisclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  government  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies  to  guide  planning  studies  and  detailed  designs  of  subprojects. \nImplementation arrangements in the PCMU and PIUs build on experience from ADB-financed \nprojects, and ensure the PIUs have adequate capacity to understand and prepare resettlement \nplans, through consultant support and additional capacity building. Widespread consultations \nwill be undertaken with stakeholders in project areas during implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Given  the  importance  of  governance  risks  in  Cambodia,  the  project  will  implement \nspecific project level actions to mitigate risks. Building on the Cambodia Governance Risk \nAssessment and Risk Management Plan 2011, these risks have been identified and mitigation \nmeasures have been developed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The major \nproject  risks  and  mitigation  measures  include:  (i)  limited  financial  management  capacity  - \nongoing  implementation  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  to  improve \nbudget  preparation  and  execution,  financial  management  and  reporting,  procurement,  and \nstrengthening of internal controls. In addition, ADB is supporting the MEF in implementing part \nof the Public Financial Management Reform Program which includes strengthening the public \nfinancial management systems in two of the implementing agencies, the Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment  and  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology;  (ii)  inadequate \nprocurement capacity - strengthening of procurement capacity through the Public Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program,  as  well  as  additional  measures  by  ADB  to  strengthen  the \nprocurement  capacities  of the  MEF  and  the  implementing agencies, including  provision  of \nprocurement  consultants  and  training  on  the  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  the \nProcurement  Manual;  and  (iii)  corruption  -  requiring  all  contractors/bidders,  suppliers  and \nconsultants to sign declarations of ethical conduct, strengthening transparency through posting \nproject information on the IA websites, developing complaint handling mechanisms, monitoring \nand  enforcement  of  procurement  procedures  and  contracts;  and  joint  investigation  of \nirregularities by the National Audit Authority and the ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. \n \n                                                \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Subprojects with involuntary resettlement impacts will not be included in stage 2; those with significant involuntary \nresettlement impacts will not be included in stage 3.

Communications. 35  A  shared  objective  of  the  ADB\u2013government  communication \nstrategy is to build public awareness and recognition of the collaboration and its outcomes. ADB \nand  the  government  will  proactively  make  maximum  use  of  well-proven  communication \nmethodologies for raising awareness of the viability and credibility of the project, as well as \nother government activities in response to the 2011 floods.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n33.  The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the project shall conform \nto  all  applicable  ADB  policies  and  procedures  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, the Safeguard Policy Statement, safeguard frameworks, social and gender equity, \nprocurement, financial management, and disbursement.
