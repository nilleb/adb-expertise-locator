The \nsupplementary loan finances (i) cost overruns for the construction \nof a two-lane highway from Kurundugahahetekma to Pinnaduwa \ninterchange  and  the  Galle  access  road;  (ii)  expansion  of  the \nhighway  between  Kurundugahahetekma  and  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange  from  two  lanes  to  four  lanes;  (iii)  provision  of \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision  and  project \nmanagement; and (iv) provision of road safety equipment. \n   \nRationale  The Project is one of the Government\u2019s priority projects. Traffic \nvolume between the southern areas of the country and Colombo \nhas  increased  significantly;  travel  time  between  Matara  and \nColombo  is  about  4\u20135  hours.  The  completion  of  Southern \nHighway will significantly reduce travel time and lead to effective \nmovement  to  and  from  the  southern  areas  to  Colombo.  This \nimproved  connectivity  will  contribute  to  increased  economic \nactivities.  \n \nThe  Project  has  experienced  cost  overruns,  especially  due  to \nincreases in civil work costs. Contributing factors include (i) price \nescalation  due  to  delay  in  completing  land  acquisition  and \nassociated  litigations,  (ii)  undetermined  geotechnical  and  soil \nconditions, and (iii) increase in value-added tax. Implementation \ndelays due to safeguard compliance issues resulted in delayed \nhandover of the site to the contractor and increased the cost of \nconsulting  services,  mainly  because  of  the  additional  time \nrequired to supervise construction works. \n ", "ii   \n             The original Project covers construction of the first two-lanes of an \nultimate four-lane highway. However, a six-lane right-of-way was \nprepared  and  acquired.  The  design  study  indicates  that  to \nmaintain the service of an intercity highway, the Project will need \nto  be  upgraded  to  four  lanes  after  2010.  This  means  that \nupgrading needs to start now.  \n \nThe expansion to a four-lane highway is justifiable based on the \nfollowing grounds: (i) traffic demand; (ii) resource savings when \nthe  four-lane  construction  is  undertaken  simultaneously  with \nfinalizing the two-lane construction; (iii) continuity of the four-lane \nhighway from Kottawa to Matara; and (iv) improved road safety.   \n  \nThe proposed activities and components under the supplementary \nloan are consistent with Government and ADB priorities. Physical \nchanges  have  been  assessed  along  with  their  impacts  in  the \ncontext  of  current  ADB  policies.  A  review  of  safeguards \ncompliance and all steps in the matrix of due diligence have been \nobserved. The Project is technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sustainable.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact and outcomes of the supplementary loan are in line \nwith those of the Project approved in 1999. It aims to integrate the \nsouthern  region  into  the  country\u2019s  economic  mainstream  by \nimproving access. The Project will promote economic growth of \nthe southern region by improving access to the more developed \nWestern Province, especially with Colombo and other important \nfacilities such as the international port and airport. By 2010, travel \ntime between Kottawa and Matara will be reduced from 4 to 2 \nhours. By expanding the Southern Highway to four-lane standard, \nsignificant accidents will be avoided.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the supplementary loan is estimated at \n$179.10 million, including taxes and duties.   \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n  Total   \nSource  ($ million)  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  90.00   50.30 \nGovernment  89.10    49.70 \nTotal  179.10  100.00 \n \n   \nA loan of $90 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project  \nagreements. \n   ", "  iii\nPeriod of Utilization  30 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Highways and Road Development \n   \nImplementation  The Road Development Authority will continue to implement the \nArrangements  Project, and the existing project management unit will continue its \nfunctions for day-to-day project management. \n   \nProcurement  The existing civil works contract was restructured to include four-\nlane construction with reduced road length of 29.2 km, which is \nthe  Kurundugahahetekma\u2013Pinnaduwa  interchange  section,  and \napproximately 5.6 km of Galle access road. The balance of works \nfor  the  Pinnaduwa  interchange\u2013Matara  section,  including  four-\nlane construction, will be procured by following the Government \nprocurement laws and procedures.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Services of the construction supervision consultant funded by the \noriginal 1999 loan will continue until February 2008. Thereafter, \nadditional  inputs  of  about  140  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 1,040 of national consulting will be required under \nthe  supplementary  loan  to  supervise  civil  works  in \nKurundugahahetekma\u2013Pinnaduwa interchange section and Galle \naccess road.  \n \nThe  current  management  consultant,  financed  by  the  Nordic \nDevelopment Fund, will provide services until the end of 2008. \nThereafter,  an  additional  34  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 218 person-months of national consulting will be \nrequired under the supplementary loan.  \n \nThe consultants will be selected using quality- and cost-based \nselection, and single-source selection, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Project\u2019s procurement plan. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will trigger economic development and job creation in \nBeneficiaries  the hinterlands and on the south coast. \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  Timely  completion  of  civil  works  is  at  risk  if  contractor \nperformance is not satisfactory; therefore work programs need to \nbe  monitored  systematically.  Completing  all  sections  of  the \nSouthern Highway on schedule is important so that benefits can \nbe directly recognized. The risk is mitigated by using two contract \npackages  and  employing  two  construction  supervision \nconsultants and one management consultant.  \n \nAnother  risk  involves  improper  implementation  safeguard \nmeasures. Although no more land needs to be acquired for the \nright-of-way,  continued  implementation  of  the  resettlement \nimplementation  plan  and  strict  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  to  minimize  all  potential \nenvironmental impacts during construction will be very important \nto ensure the Project is completed as planned.   \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the supplementary loan, technical assistance \n(TA) is proposed for Land Use Planning of the Southern Highway \nCorridor.  The  estimated  cost  is  $375,000,  of  which  ADB  will \nfinance $300,000 on a grant basis from the ADB TA funding \nprogram. About 6 person-months of international consulting and \n20 of national consulting will be required. The consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  \n \n \n ", "80 o 00'E 80 o 00'E 81 o 30'E\nP a l k     S t r a i Jtaffna KankaKsoadnitkuarmaiam Bay  o f  Bengal\nNational Capital Kilinochchi\nP a l k     B a y\nProvincial Capital Mullaittivu\nCity/Town Tanniyuttu\nTalaimannar\nInterchange Mankulam\nSouthern Highway Project 7 o 00'N NORTHERN 7 o 00'N\nRoad Connected to Interchange Mannar Puliyankulam\nNational Road Vavuniya\nGulf  of \nOther Road Mannar\nRailway Horowupotana Trincomalee\nRiver\nAnuradhapura\nProvincial Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Southern \nTransport Development Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor  Land  Use  Planning  of  the  Southern  Highway  Corridor,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and the status of project \nreadiness is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n2.  On 25 November 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the loan for the \nSouthern  Transport  Development  Project  (STDP) 1 from  its  Special  Funds  resources  for \nSDR64,856,000 (or $90 million at the time of loan signing, and currently $96.4 million). The \nLoan and Project agreements were signed on 16 December 1999 and became effective on \n30 October 2002.  \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 1995, the Government, with assistance from the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, carried out a master plan study in the southern region to strengthen linkages with the \nnational economy.2 The study found that unemployment rate of the southern region was well \nabove the national average, and its per capita gross regional domestic product was only 69% of \nthe national average. It also found that the region\u2019s development was severely constrained by \npoor  transport  links  with  other  parts  of  the  country,  in  particular  with  Colombo  and  the \neconomically dominant Western Province. In 1996, the Government established the Southern \nDevelopment Authority to oversee implementation of the master plan. At the same time, the \nGovernment discussed its options for overcoming the region\u2019s transport constraints with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n4.  ADB  provided  TA3 to  study  options  for  improving  road  transport  linkages  between \nColombo and the southern region. The TA concluded that construction of a new highway on an \ninland alignment is preferable to improving the existing coastal National Highway A2. The A2 \nimprovement was rejected for a number of reasons: (i) insufficient space for widening, as both \nsides were occupied by extensive commercial and residential development; (ii) improvement of \nthe coastal highway would not provide access to the less-developed and far more poverty-prone \nhinterland; and (iii) the existing A2 was vulnerable to sea erosion, already requiring substantial \nand costly correction works. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

ADB\u2019s  country  operation  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka4 notes  the  importance  of  the  road \nnetwork  in  linking  the  domestic  economy  and  promoting  the  decentralization  of  economic \nopportunities.  It  recommends  that  the  road  subsector  continue  to  be  a  priority  for  ADB \ninvolvement, with particular emphasis on improving (i) key transport corridors emanating from \nColombo,  of  which  the  project  highway  is  of  primary  importance;  and  (ii)  links  between \nsecondary urban centers and rural areas surrounding them. In November 1999, ADB approved \na loan for the Project (footnote 1).     \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n6.  The  primary  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  facilitate  and  act  as  a  catalyst  for \ndevelopment in the economically deprived southern region by constructing a new southern \nhighway  linking  Colombo  with  Galle,  the  capital  of  Southern  Province,  and  Matara;  and  \n(ii) produce a sustainable and quantifiable reduction in the country's very high road accident \nrate. The secondary objective is poverty reduction within the immediate project area, where \nmore than 30% of the population is classified as poor, and within the south of the country \ngenerally. The Project has two components.  \n \n1.  Southern Highway Component \n7.  Civil  Works.  The  Project  includes  the  construction  of  the  main  alignment  for  the \nhighway, comprising the first two-lane carriageway of an ultimately four-lane, high-capacity, \nlimited-access  highway  from  Kottawa  to  Matara;  and  construction  of  access  highways  to \nconnect the main express highway to the existing A2 highway and Galle. ADB is financing the \nsouthern  section  (Kurundugahahetekma\u2013Matara)  of  the  main  alignment  and  the  access \nhighway to Galle (ADB-financed section). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) \nis funding the remaining northern part of the highway (Kottawa\u2013Kurundugahahetekma).  \n \n8.  Consulting Services. ADB is financing the construction supervision consultant (CSC) \nfor the civil works in the ADB-financed section, including design review and monitoring of \nenvironmental and social impacts. JBIC is financing similar consulting services for the JBIC-\nfinanced section. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) is financing a management consultant \nfor overall project implementation. The management consultant assists the Road Development \nAuthority  (RDA)  to  coordinate  the  civil  works  components  of  the  JBIC-  and  ADB-financed \nsections, implement the road safety component, and monitor implementation of land acquisition \nand  social  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  management  consultant  is  also  responsible  for \ndeveloping an approach to manage, operate, and maintain the highway. \n \n2.  Road Safety Component \n9.  Civil Works. ADB financed civil works for reducing safety hazards at specific locations \nas a pilot model on how to prioritize black spot location and to manage black spots from \ntechnical and other aspects. The locations were selected and civil works designed by the \ncomponent\u2019s consulting services.  \n \n10.  Consulting Services. The component includes (i) preparation and implementation of an \naction plan to reduce road accidents; (ii) preparation of actions to operate high-speed, access-\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

NDF \nfinanced  the  component\u2019s  consulting  services.  The  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation  Agency  is  financing  implementation  of  the  road  safety  action  plan,  capacity \nbuilding, and a road safety audit. \n \n11.  Equipment. NDF financed the provision of equipment required for component activities. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n12.  The total cost of the original project was $295.9 million. The cost of the ADB-financed \ncomponent was estimated at $132.4 million equivalent.5 ADB provided, from its Special Funds \nresources, a loan of SDR64,856,000 ($90.0 million at the time of loan signing) to finance about \n30.4% of the total cost. The loan maturity is 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nan  annual  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency provided a grant of $1.0 million equivalent for \nthe  road  safety  component;  NDF  provided  a  loan  of  $6.7  million  equivalent  for  financing \nmanagement consultant services, the road safety component, and road safety equipment. The \nGovernment financed the remaining 26.2% of the project cost or about $37.4 million equivalent. \nThe original cost estimates and financing plan of the ADB-financed component is in Table 1.  \n                                                 \n5  The estimated cost of the JBIC-financed component was $163.6 million, for which JBIC has provided a loan of \n$120 million equivalent. \n ", "4   \n \nTable 1: Original Cost Estimates and Financing Plana \n($ million) \n \nItem  Total  ADB  NDF  Sida  Govt \nA.

Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n13.  The approved loan was signed on 16 December 1999 and became effective only on 30 \nOctober 2002, after five extensions to enable the Government to fulfill the conditions for loan \neffectiveness, mainly related to land acquisition and resettlement. The loan closing date was \nextended from 31 December 2006 to 30 June 2008. \n \n1.  Southern Highway Component  \n14.  The contract for the ADB-financed section of the highway was awarded as a single \npackage on 3 January 2003. The original contract price of $87 million was adjusted as of July \n2007 to $156.5 million. The original completion period of 40 months until 25 April 2006, was \nextended to 22 February 2008. The civil works cover (i) the main alignment 59.6 kilometers (km) \nof the highway and 5.6 km of the Galle access road, (ii) 642 pipe culverts and 63 box culverts, \nand (iii) 22 bridges including four major bridges. The civil works contract was restructured to \ninclude expansion of the carriageway to four lanes and reduction of the length to include only \nconstruction of the highway from Kurundugahahetekma to Pinnaduwa interchange including the ", "  5\nGalle access road (around 34.8 km). The contract value is now $241 million. The southern \nsection from Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama in Matara will be expanded to four lanes and \nbe funded by the Government. The contract value of the southern section is around $99 million.  \n \n15.  The significant delay in project implementation was due to (i) delays in handing over of \nsites to the contractor because of issues in land acquisition and resettlement of people affected; \n(ii) complaints and court cases by those affected on environmental and social safeguard issues, \nwhich stopped physical works on several occasions; (iii) investigations by ADB's Compliance \nReview  Panel  (CRP);  (iv)  delays  in  obtaining  some  government  clearances  such  as \nenvironmental clearances for rock blasting; (v) inadequate resources provided by the contractor; \nand (vi) occurrence of underestimated deposits of soft and unsuitable soil material in the original \ncontract (due to incomplete survey and design at the time of bidding), requiring removal and/or \nground treatment. As of the end of October 2007, the overall progress of the ADB-financed \nsection was 71%, equivalent to value of work around $95.5 million. \n \n16.  The  JBIC-financed  section  comprises  two  packages.  Package  1,  from  Colombo \n(Kottawa)  to  Dodangoda  (34.9  km)  was  awarded  in  August  2005  at  a  contract  price  of  \n$96  million;  in  July  2007,  the  contract  price  was  increased  due  to  price  escalation  to  \n$120 million for four lanes, with a completion period of 48 months until 18 September 2009. \nPackage 2, Dodangoda\u2013Kurundugahahetekma (31.7 km), awarded on 24 March 2006, was \nvalued at $.83 million for two lanes, and in July 2007, the contract was restructured to cover \nexpansion to four lanes. The contract value after restructuring the civil work contract is now \n$151.5 million, and the completion period of 48 months ends 23 March 2010.6 As of  December \n2007, package 1 was 21% complete and package 2 was 9% complete.     \n \n2.  Road Safety Component  \n17.  The road safety consultants commenced work in February 2002, and completed their \nassignment at the end of December 2005. They provided assistance to RDA for activities, such \nas strengthening road safety institutions, conducting road safety audits on existing roads and on \nthe final project design, revising traffic laws and regulations, establishing emergency rescue \nservices, and identifying and designing rectification measures for accident black spots.  \n \n18.  The  Road  Safety  Unit  within  RDA  and  National  Road  Safety  Secretariat  were \nestablished. The latter coordinates the works of the National Council for Road Safety, which has \n17 stakeholders appointed to coordinate implementation of the National Road Safety Strategic \nPlan. The regulations for a road safety fund are being finalized. It has been gazetted that 1% of \nthe insurance premium for third party motoring risks will be transmitted to the fund. \n \n19.  Black spot improvements in 20 areas under six packages in several ADB-financed roads \nwere completed by April 2007.  \n \n20.  Computer equipment and software for the accident data system as well as equipment for \ntraffic police and equipment were installed by June 2007.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The Government has requested JBIC to provide another loan to finance four lanes for this section. \n ", "6   \n3.  Loan Covenants \n21.  The compliance status of project loan covenants is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \nThe Project is in substantial compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. Almost all of the \nloan covenants have been either complied with or are being complied with. Two loan covenants \nhave not been complied with: the National Highways Act and the Motor Traffic Act were to be \nenacted  by  31  December  2001.  The  delay  was  mostly  due  to  executive  and  legislative \ninstitutional changes. Elections in 2002, 2004, and 2005 further delayed processing of the \nlegislation.   \n \n22.  Following Cabinet approval, the first draft of the National Highways Act was submitted to \nParliament in July 2001. Due to the change of government, the matter was not processed \nfurther. Subsequently, the National Highways Act was renamed the Thoroughfares Act. The \nrevised version, cleared by the legal draftsman, has been concurred by the attorney general. \nThe final version will be submitted to Cabinet for approval, and the Government will ensure that \nthe proposed statute is submitted to Parliament by September  2008.  \n \n23.  The final draft of the Motor Traffic Act was submitted to the Law Commission for final \nreview. The Law Commission has given its concurrence, and the Ministry of Railway and \nTransport had asked the commissioner of motor traffic to review the draft to ensure that all \nsalient features are included. The draft statute has been submitted to the attorney general for \nconcurrence prior to submission to Cabinet for approval. The Government will ensure that this \nproposed statute is submitted to Parliament by September 2008.  \n \n4.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n24.  Implementation of the southern highway component has experienced difficulties related \nto ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards policies. In December 2004, the CRP registered \na request for a compliance review of the Project. The CRP determined that the request was \neligible, and the Board authorized the CRP to conduct a compliance review on the Project. A \nsummary  of  significant  features  of  the  progress  on  the  implementation  of  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards of the original loan and CRP\u2019s recommendations follow.  \n \n \na.  Social Safeguards \n \n25.  Following completion of the detailed project design, a resettlement implementation plan \n(RIP) was formulated to address involuntary resettlement impacts of the entire highway from \nKottawa to Godagama in Matara, including the Galle access road. In October 2002, ADB \napproved the RIP prior to loan effectiveness. The acquisition of land and other property for the \nright-of-way (ROW) for six lanes resulted in the physical displacement of 1,370 households with \n6,223  people.  About  38%  were  relocated  at  32  resettlement  sites,  and  other  physically \ndisplaced households (62%) opted for self-relocation. In addition, the Project affected (but not \nphysically displaced) about 5,900 households who live by the ROW of the highway. Some lost \npart of their cultivated land or homesteads, or both. Others lost employment sources such as \nsharecropping  in  rice  fields,  wage  work  in  small  tea  and  rubber  plantations,  and  small \nbusinesses. \n ", "  7\n26.  All  those  affected,  except  some  who  disputed  the  amounts  payable  or  where  the \nproperties  are  under  joint  ownership,  received  statutory  compensation  under  the  Land \nAcquisition  Act  and  resettlement  assistance  under  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nCommittee (LARC) review of the replacement value of acquired property. \n \n27.  Although squatters were not compensated under the Land Acquisition Act, they were \ngiven LARC assistance. Each squatter household received a piece of land at a resettlement site \n(the size of which ranges from 10 to 20 perches)7, and compensation for their structures \nacquired  at  replacement  value  in  addition  to  other  general  entitlements  listed  in  RIP;  294 \nsquatter households received land plots and financial assistance to build houses at resettlement \nsites.  \n \n28.  To minimize the displacement trauma and ensure that they integrate smoothly and \nrapidly  into  their  host  communities,  most  resettlement  sites  were  established  close  to  the \nProject\u2019s  affected  villages.  The  housing  committee  at  each  resettlement  site  organizes \ncommunity  work  among  resettlers,  enabling  them  to  evolve  as  communities  that  are  well \nintegrated into host communities. The housing committee reviews the adequacy of basic site \nfacilities, suggests improvements, and assists vulnerable households in constructing houses \nand in finding employment in the vicinity. The resettlement sites established a few years ago \nshow a remarkable improvement in common infrastructure, homestead development, water \nsupply, and housing conditions. With the assistance of housing committees and support from \nRDA and regional development agencies, 31 resettlement sites have been handed over to the \nlocal authority and the last resettlement site is expected to reach similar standards and be \nhanded over to the local authority in the second quarter of 2008.  \n \n29.  The RIP was developed with a broader objective to address socioeconomic impacts of \nthe  Project,  and  to  ensure  at  least  the  restoration  of  pre-project  household  incomes, \nimprovement  of  living  standards  and  income  earning  capacity,  and  production  of  affected \nhouseholds. In this context, an income restoration program (IRP) is being implemented for \naffected households. This program began in 2005. Some households that received large sums \nof money as compensation and LARC assistance and used the money in an unsustainable \nmanner to build spacious houses beyond their means; they now have half-built houses. Others \nused compensation in various businesses without proper planning and lost their capital. The \nprogram  initially  assists  1,050  affected  households,  including  266  vulnerable  households, \nheaded by women, who moved into RDA\u2019s resettlement sites. However, this program needs to \nbe strengthened to achieve its objectives.   \n \n30.  The management consultant monitors land acquisition, compensation payments, and \nrelocation. In 2006, comprehensive land acquisition and resettlement audits were carried out to \nassess the progress of the resettlement program. An independent external monitoring agency \nwas appointed in April 2006 to verify the quality and timeliness of compensation payment, \ndelivery of LARC assistance, and the resettlement process; and to assess whether the Project \nachieved its goals and the objectives of the RIP. The external monitoring agency used a \ncomprehensive monitoring framework to evaluate the impact of the Project on 400 sample \nhouseholds and in June 2007, reports the following: \n \n                                                 \n7 One perch is equal to  approximately 36 square meters. \n ", "8   \n(i)  RDA has made a good effort to implement the RIP, and has modified some of the \nrecommended practices listed in the RIP to take into account realities that were \nnot known at the time of RIP preparation. \n(ii)  The RIP is too schematic. This has generated some implementation difficulties. It \nhas several biases, namely, cash compensation, housing for the displaced, and \nrehabilitation  of  the  landless.  As  a  result,  although  the  Project  provides \ncompensation-in-kind, as specified in the RIP, to displaced people, in case of \nacquired  agricultural  land,  the  Project  has  paid  cash  compensation  to  those \naffected.  \n(iii)  Success in building new housing to preacquisition or most often better quality in \nresettlement sites and self-relocated sites is significant.  \n(iv)  The detailed processes followed by the LARC to arrive at the replacement value \nof all acquired property and thereby to ensure that those affected are at least \nrestored to their preacquisition livelihood and income are found to be satisfactory.  \n(v)  Nontitled holders and the landless (including squatters) have been recognized for \ncompensation and other resettlement assistance. They have benefited from the \nresettlement process.  \n(vi)  The documentation of the resettlement process needs to be developed in a \nsystematic manner8.  \n \nb.  Environmental Safeguards  \n \n31.  The  Central  Environment  Authority  (CEA)  approved  the  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) on 23 July 1999. CEA\u2019s approval was subject to the highway alignment being \npartly changed to avoid the Koggala and Madu Gangga wetlands. During preparation of detailed \ndesign, this key condition was duly addressed and the new alignment came to be known as the \n\u201cfinal trace\u201d of the highway. The engineering consultant prepared the Environmental Findings \nReport,  which  basically  reported  the  environmental  conditions  of  the  final  alignment  and \npotential environmental impacts related to the final alignment. This report, submitted to RDA \nand ADB in 2000, was not presented as an EIA report for the final trace, mainly because CEA \ndid not require the submission of a supplementary EIA report for the final alignment. This is a \nmajor factor that led the CRP to evaluate the Project as noncompliant. The other noncompliance \n(assessed by the CRP) was based on the absence of the assessment of impact for the Galle \naccess road.9   \n  \n32.  Nonetheless, to comply with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), a \nsupplementary environmental assessment for the final alignment including the Galle access \nroad was prepared to cover sections of the final trace not studied in detail in the 1999 EIA. The \nsummary of the supplementary environmental assessment report, together with the summary \nEIA for four lanes, was disclosed on 19 April 2007. \n \n33.  The first environment management plan (EMP) was submitted to CEA in January 2005 \nand approved in August 2005. Subsequently, RDA instructed the contractor and construction \nsupervision  consultant  (CSC)  to  implement  the  EMP.  The  contractor  is  responsible  for \n                                                 \n8  The management information system on the implementation of the RIP has been completed and the system has \nbeen functional.   \n9  The Government\u2019s EIA requirement excludes any construction of new roads less than 10 km, and therefore, no \nenvironmental assessment was completed for the proposed Galle access road as it is less than 6 km.   ", "  9\nimplementing mitigation measures of environmental impacts associated with the construction \nworks.  In  2006,  the  EMP  was  updated  by  incorporating  the  recommendation  from  the \nsupplementary  environmental  assessment  for  the  final  alignment  and  the  environmental \nassessment study for expansion of the road to four lanes. The CEA endorsed the revised EMP \non 3 September 2007. \n \n34.  Although  the  procedural  requirement  in  terms  of  preparation  of  the  environmental \nassessment studies, and monitoring EMP implementation are in place, the outputs of EMP \nimplementation need to be strengthened. The environmental impacts related to public health \ndue to dust, noise and vibration, stagnant water, disruption of access, and uncontrolled disposal \nof unwanted materials need to be systematically mitigated. In this context, the CSC is now \nequipped with environmental experts to supervise and control the contractor\u2019s activities that \ngenerate environmental impacts.  \n \nc.  Compliance Review Panel\u2019s Recommendations \n35.  In June 2005, the CRP approved a course of actions to bring the Project back to policy \ncompliance. The first annual monitoring of implementation of the CRP recommendations was \ncarried out in June 2006, and its report was disclosed on 11 July 2006. The second monitoring \nwas carried out in November 2007, and its report was disclosed on 27 December 2007. The \nCRP\u2019s first three recommendations deal with ADB-wide safeguard policy requirements. The \nremaining  recommendations  are  specific  to  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  Board  Compliance  Review \nCommittee noted considerable progress in the implementation of the CRP\u2019s recommendations. \nThe current implementation status of the course of actions is given in Appendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \nA.  Cost Overrun and Proposed Change of Scope \n1.  Cost Overrun  \n36.  In project appraisal for the original loan, civil works were estimated to cost $70.4 million \nbased on the feasibility study (footnote 4). The civil works contract was awarded at $87 million. \nThe original loan provides contingencies of $35.4 million, considered sufficient to cover the \nadditional cost of the contract. During implementation, however, additional costs amounting to \n$69.5 million were observed mainly due to (i) price escalation, (ii) increase in value-added tax, \n(iii) increase in costs caused by undetermined geotechnical and soil conditions at the site, and \n(iv) delays in handover of the site to the contractor due to land acquisition and resettlement \n(LAR) problems. The implementation delay also increased the cost of consulting services. \nAppendix 3 provides a detailed calculation of the cost overrun.   \n \n37.  LAR costs increased from $7.6 million to $44 million. The original cost was based on a \nsurvey of 20% of the project area completed for the feasibility study. Subsequently, detailed \ndesign was prepared taking into account CEA\u2019s recommendation to avoid ecologically sensitive \nareas. Based on the detailed design, a 100% survey of the affected area resulted in the much \nhigher LAR cost of $44 million. The Government financed the cost, and therefore no financing of \nLAR is proposed under the supplementary loan. This supplementary loan (SL) will finance cost \noverruns  for  construction  of  the  two-lane  highway  from  Kurundugahatekma  to  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange and the Galle access road. \n ", "10  \n \n2.  Proposed Expansion from a Two-Lane to a Four-Lane Highway \n38.  Under  the  approved  loan,  the  Project  involves  construction  of  the  first  two-lane \ncarriageway of an ultimate four-lane, high-capacity, limited access highway. In this context, a \nsix-lane ROW for the highway was prepared and the associated land was completely acquired. \nThe civil works were awarded for construction of two lanes and, at present, all bridges have \nbeen constructed to cater to a four-lane highway, except for one bridge (bridge no. 20). The \nexpansion to four lanes was anticipated from the initial stage of the preparation of highway \nconstruction. The incremental cost for construction of four lanes is estimated at $200.30 million.  \n \n39.  The civil works for the original ADB section (from Kurundugahahetekma to Godagama in \nMatara) to complete the two lanes and expand to four lanes will be divided into two contract \npackages.  Package  1  covers  the  civil  works  from  Kurundugahahetekma  to  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange and Galle access road, and package 2 covers the civil works from Pinnaduwa \ninterchange to Godagama in Matara. SL will finance 50% of package 1 or approximately $69.25 \nmillion; the Government or another cofinancier will finance the rest of package 1, and package \n2.  \n \n3.  Consulting Services and Project Management \n40.  The  construction  work  will  require  continuity  of  the  construction  supervision  and \nmanagement  consultants  in  helping  RDA\u2019s  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  supervise \nconstruction and ensure coordination of consultants and contractors. The estimated cost for \nconsultancy services financed under SL is $9.3 million, comprising part of the costs for the \nmanagement consultant for the whole Southern Highway, and the cost for CSC for package 1. \nIn addition, SL will continue financing the PMU\u2019s incremental expenditures.  \n \n4.  Road Safety Equipment \n41.  As the Southern Highway will be the first highway in Sri Lanka, provision of road safety \nequipment  is  critical  to  minimize  road  accidents.  Therefore,  SL  will  cover  50%  of  the \nprocurement of the highway's equipment comprising (i) an advanced traffic management system \nto centrally monitor roads; (ii) weigh-in-motion/static weighing platforms to control overloading; \n(iii)  speed-monitoring  equipment;  and  (iv)  ambulances,  police  vehicles  and  other  rescue \nequipment, and other supporting services to operate the highway. The total estimated cost of \nthe road safety equipment is $4.9 million.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n42.  The impact and outcomes of the supplementary loan are in line with those of the Project \nas approved in 1999. It aims to integrate the southern region into the country\u2019s economic \nmainstream by improving access to economic and social opportunities for residents of the \nregion. The expected impact is improved socioeconomic conditions in the southern region. The \nexpected outcomes are increased economic opportunities and social services for southern \nregion residents through efficient road linkages with the capital city and other regions.  \n \n43.  With the completion of construction of a four-lane highway, the supplementary loan is \nexpected to significantly contribute to improving access from the southern region to Western ", "  11\nProvince, especially with Colombo and other important facilities such as the international port \nand airport. It will strengthen efforts to reduce road accidents and significantly reduce travel \ntime.    \n \nC.  Rationale \n44.  The  Project  remains  an  important  backbone  of  connectivity  from  the  south  of  the \ncountry. Currently, only the A2 highway serves the southern coastal area. It has reached its \ntraffic  capacity  in  many  sections  and  has  limited  potential  for  capacity  expansion  due  to \ndevelopment along the road. The Southern Highway is expected to serve the transport needs \nespecially with expansion of Galle Port and also the plan to develop Hambantota port. The \nSouthern Highway will contribute significantly to development of the southern region. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program also focuses on helping the Government improve the transport \nsector; completing the Project is critical from ADB\u2019s point of view. \n \n45.  The Government requested a supplementary loan to complete the Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. However, due to unavailability, the Government agreed to borrow \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has recovered quickly from \nthe tsunami. Growth was 6.7% in 2007. The preliminary debt sustainability assessments show \nthat  Sri  Lanka  has  the  ability  to  borrow  on  fully  commercial  terms.  On  this  basis,  a \nsupplementary loan from OCR is appropriate to assist the Government in meeting its required \ncapital for financing a large infrastructure investment.  \n \n46.  The supplementary loan will cover the cost overrun for continuing construction of the \ntwo-lane  highway  in  the  Kurundugahahetekma-Pinnaduwa  interchange  section  and  Galle \naccess  road,  its  additional  expansion  to  a  four-lane  highway,  provision  of  construction \nsupervision and management consultancy, and provision of road safety equipment. The loan is \njustifiable on the following grounds.  \n \n1.  Traffic Demand  \n47.  The current traffic counts show that overall annual growth rates vary from 5% to 10.7% \nwith an average of 6.8%. The results are higher than the 1998 study used as the basis for the \n2000 design study. The 2000 design study indicated that the northern part of the ADB-financed \nsection would need to be upgraded to four lanes between 2010 and 2015 to maintain services in \nline with an intercity highway. \n \n2.  Resource Savings from Construction-Related Works  \n48.  The existing two-lane construction is to be completed by the end of February 2008. If the \nGovernment follows the original plan, it would need to embark on large-scale construction work \nfor four lanes and significant time for initiating civil construction works, especially for obtaining \nall licenses and permits for construction-related works. Therefore, additional time and financing \nwill  be  needed.  The  proposed  expansion  of  the  highway  to  four  lanes  undertaken \nsimultaneously with the two-lane construction will amount to substantial savings in time and \ncost, and reduce disruption associated with construction activities. \n \n ", "12  \n3.  Continuity of Highway \n49.  The  first  35  km  of  the  Southern  Highway  from  Kottawa  to  Dodangoda  is  being \nconstructed  with  four  lanes.  The  remaining  JBIC-financed  section  from  Dodangoda  to \nKurundugahahetekma (31 km) is also currently being constructed as four-lane highway. The \nfirst package will be completed by September 2009, and the second by April 2010. Expansion of \nthe ADB-financed section to a four-lane highway will provide a continuous four-lane highway \nfrom Kottawa to Godagama in Matara. \n \n4.  Improvement in Road Safety \n50.  Without increasing the ADB-financed section to four lanes and the associated road \nsafety equipment, road accidents are expected to increase as traffic volume increases. A road \nsafety study carried out under the NDF-funded road safety component indicates that increasing \nthis section to four lanes with a divided carriageway will avoid head-on collisions caused by \novertaking traffic. About 27 fatal accidents and 55 serious injury accidents are estimated to be \navoided each year.  \n   \n5.  Compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Supplementary Financing10 \n51.  The proposed activities and components under the supplementary loan (i) are consistent \nwith  the  priorities  of  the  Government  and  ADB;  (ii)  complied  with  the  requirements  for \nassessment of impact due to physical changes in the context of current ADB policies; (iii) \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sustainable; and (iv) complied with the \nrequirements for ADB safeguards policies. All steps in the matrix of due diligence have been \nobserved  (including  technical,  capacity,  and  institutional  assessments,  and  economic  and \nfinancial analyses of the revised Project). \n \n \nD.  Policy Safeguard Due Diligence \n52.  Since  the  supplementary  loan  involves  a  physical  change,  policy  safeguard  due \ndiligence, especially for resettlement and environment, was undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s safeguards policies.  \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n53.  Resettlement  due  diligence  conducted  from  May  to  July  2006  included  a  detailed \nconsultation program with people who live by the ROW of the ADB-financed highway section. \nThe proposed widening of the highway from two lanes to four lanes may not require any land \nacquisition or relocation of residents because the proposed additional two lanes fall within the \nalready  acquired  ROW  for  the  six-lane  highway.  In  the  event  that  any  unanticipated  land \nacquisition is required, it will be done as per the approved RIP principles and procedures, and \nprocedure  stated  in  the  circular  (8  September  2006)  issued  by  the  secretary,  Ministry  of \nHighways.  \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005. Operations Manual. OM H5 BP and OP: Supplementary Financing. Manila. ", "  13\n54.  The Project will continue with several resettlement activities such as (i) implementation \nof  the  income  restoration  program  (IRP),  (ii)  provision  of  special  assistance  to  vulnerable \naffected people, (iii) issuance of entitlement certificates and resettlement title deeds, and (iv) \npayment  of  interest  for  delayed  statutory  compensation.  The  due  diligence  report \n(Supplementary Appendix C) outlines the resettlement implementation issues common to both \nongoing two-lane construction and proposed additional two lanes. The establishment of the \nEnvironment and Social Division (ESD) at RDA with resettlement officers and resettlement \nassistants will improve monitoring of the resettlement program.  \n \n55.  The management consultant will continue implementation and monitoring of the RIP and \nIRP for the Project. The independent external monitoring agency developed (i) a monitoring and \nevaluation framework, (ii) a reporting framework, and (iii) data collection methodologies. RDA \nthrough ESD will ensure the continuation of the internal monitoring of implementation and \nimpact of the RIP and IRP. ESD, therefore, will need to improve its monitoring and evaluation \ncapacity. \n    \n56.  The proposed widening of the highway from two to four lanes will not trigger ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).   \n \n57.  In  July  2006,  a  detailed  consultation  program  (as  part  of  the  due  diligence)  was \nconducted with 250 affected people living along the ROW in eight divisional secretariats through \nwhich the highway is being constructed. The interviewees indicate that they are more concerned \nwith temporary environmental problems arising from construction works such as dust, noise, \nsteep embankments that cause damage to houses, blocked access roads, water logging, and \nfloods than with social issues such as compensation payment, amount of compensation, LARC \nassistance, and livelihood restoration programs.  \n \n2.  Environment-Related Aspects \n58.  The Government, based on its National Environment Act, ensured that the 1999 EIA \ncovered the construction of a six-lane highway, and therefore no EIA is required for expansion \nto four lanes. However, road expansion from two to four lanes is classified as an \u201cA\u201d project in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. Accordingly, an EIA study was undertaken. The \nsummary EIA was disclosed through ADB\u2019s website and circulated to the Board on 19 April \n2007. The resulting EMP was submitted to CEA for endorsement and necessary incorporation \ninto the current EMP. CEA endorsed the EMP on 3 September 2007.  \n \n59.  The environmental due diligence was a two-pronged approach11. Stage 1 is related to \nthe EIA for constructing a two-lane highway on the final alignment and Galle access road. Stage \n2 focused on assessing impacts associated with expansion from two lanes to four lanes within \nthe six-lane ROW. The stage 2 study concluded that the construction impacts will be broadly \nsimilar to those of stage 1. Construction of four lanes will require another 2 years, and therefore, \nthe environmental impacts associated with construction such as dust, noise, water logging, \ndisruption of access, etc. will continue until the end of 2009. The amount of unsuitable soil that \nneeds to be disposed of will increase by around 400,000 cubic meters.   \n \n                                                 \n11 The  approach  takes  into  account  the  1999  EIA  report,  environmental  findings  report,  and  supplementary \nenvironmental assessment for the final trace. \n ", "14  \n60.  Two consultations on environment-related matters were conducted with people affected. \nThe first consultation during 21\u201325 May 2006 gathered public concerns on the plan to expand to \na four-lane highway. Concerns are mainly related to construction activities such as dust, noise, \nstagnant water, etc. The second consultation during 13\u201316 July 2006 discussed the proposed \nEMP. The public supports the proposed EMP, with the expectation that environmental impacts \nassociated with construction works will be properly mitigated.  \n  \n61.  The EMP will be strictly implemented by all parties: contractor, CSC and PMU. RDA will \nstrengthen its efforts to improve EMP implementation. ESD will be involved in monitoring EMP \nimplementation, taking a role as a monitoring party outside the Project but within RDA. The \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Committee,  chaired  by  CEA  with  members  from  other  relevant \ngovernment  agencies  and  local  government,  will  continue  with  its  role  as  an  independent \nmonitoring party within the Government.     \n \nE.  Revised Cost Estimates \n62.  Revised costs for the Project, including those financed by the supplementary loan, are \nestimated at $448.60 million including taxes and duties (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Revised Cost Estimatesa  \n($ million) \n    Original       \n    Cost after  Additional  Cost for   \n  Original  Reallocation  Cost  Four  Revised \nItem  Cost  of Cost  Overrun  Lanes  Total Cost \nA.

Investment Plan  \n63.  The total cost to complete the civil works for two-lane highway and expansion to four-\nlane highway from Kurundugahahetekma to Pinnaduwa Interchange and to complete Galle \naccess road, consulting services, project management, environmental management, road safety \nequipment,  contingencies  and  other  administrative  costs  is  $179.10  million  (Table  3).  The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nG.  Financing Plan  \n64.  The Government has requested a loan of $90,000,000.00 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance the Project\u2019s cost overrun and widening of the Southern Highway. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \nTable 3: Investment Plan for the Supplementary Loan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The ADB loan will be utilized to finance (i) part of the expenditure for package 1 civil \nworks  (cost  overrun  for  the  two-lane  section  and  expansion  to  four  lanes  from \nKurundugahahetekma  to  Pinnaduwa  interchange  and  Galle  access  road),  (ii)  the  CSC \nexpenditure for package 1, (iii) part of management consultant expenditure from January 2009, \n(iv) part of expenditure for road safety equipment, and (v) incremental expenditure for project \nmanagement. The Government will finance the interest and other costs during construction \n(Table 4).  \n \n \n \n ", "16  \n \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for the Supplementary Loan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  90.00  50.3 \nGovernment  89.10  49.7 \n  Total  179.10  100.0 \nSources: ADB and RDA estimates. \n \n66.  The  Government  is  now  working  with  potential  cofinancier  to  finance  part  of  the \nexpenditures for package 2 of civil works (cost overrun for the two-lane section and expansion \nto four lanes from Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama in Matara) to reduce Government \ncontributions.  \n \nH.  Remedial Actions \n67.  The remedial actions to avoid further cost overrun have been implemented based on the \ncomprehensive review mission in August 2006. The agreed action plan between ADB and the \nGovernment is being monitored on a monthly basis, especially to increase the productivity of the \ncontractor and the efficiency of the supervision works of the CSC, management consultant, and \nPMU. Land acquisition, the major cause of delay, is now complete. The geotechnical and soil \nconditions are better known now. The revised cost estimates are based on detailed design \ntaking into account the terrain conditions and current market price, so no further cost overrun is \nexpected. \n \n68.  To  improve  the  Project\u2019s  performance,  the  civil  works  have  been  divided  into  two \ncontract  packages.  Package  1  involves  construction  of  a  four-lane  highway  from \nKurundugahatekma to Pinnaduwa interchange and Galle access road. Package 2 involves \nconstruction of highway from Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama. There will be two separate \nCSCs to supervise implementation of each civil works contract package. The contractors are \nexpected to concentrate resources to achieve the target completion date.    \n \nI.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n69.  A  project  coordinating  committee  was  to  be  established  and  chaired  by  the  RDA \nchairperson. Due to the complexity of the Project, the committee has been chaired by the \nsecretary, Ministry of Highways, which recently was renamed the Ministry of Highways and \nRoad Development (MOHRD). Accordingly, for the supplementary loan, while MOHRD will be \nthe Executing Agency, RDA will continue to be responsible for project implementation. The \ncurrent PMU will continue its responsibility for day-to-day project management. PMU is headed \nby the additional general manager of RDA as the project director, assisted by an additional \nproject director, two deputy project directors, five senior and chief engineers, an accountant, \nand supporting staff. The project coordinating committee, comprising representatives from the \nExternal Resources Department, RDA, National Planning Department, JBIC, ADB, management \nconsultant, and CSC will continue to coordinate implementation of both the ADB- and JBIC-\nfinanced sections. ", "  17\n \n70.  ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission (SLRM) will continue administering the Project. The \nSLRM will closely monitor the Project's management; participate in monthly project coordinating \ncommittee meetings; and ensure quality control, speedy implementation, and rapid assistance \nto the executing and implementing agencies on procurement, disbursement, and other project \nimplementation matters. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n71.  The civil works will be substantially completed by 31 December 2009, and the loan will \nbe closed on 30 December 2010. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n72.  For the ADB-funded section, procurement of works required under the Project has been  \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The procurement plan \nis in Appendix 6. The expansion of works to add two lanes adjacent to the ongoing works to \nmake four lanes has resulted in technical and operating difficulties for two different contractors \nto work side-by-side. Therefore, the following arrangements have been adopted: \n \n(i)  The existing contract was restructured to include construction of four lanes over a \nreduced  length,  covering  the  first  section  of  the  highway,  which  is  from \nKurundugahahetekma to the Pinnaduwa interchange, and the Galle access road \n(package  1);  and  releasing  the  construction  works  for  the  section  from \nPinnaduwa interchange to Godagama in Matara (package 2). The negotiation for \nrestructuring the civil works contract was conducted by the Sub-committee on \nInvestment Facilitation chaired by the President of Sri Lanka on 16 July 2007 and \napproved  by  Cabinet  on  27  December  2007.  The  existing  contract  is  being \namended to reflect the result of the negotiations. \n \n(ii)  The balance of works in the second section (package 2), from the Pinnaduwa \ninterchange to Godagama in Matara, including construction of four lanes, will be \nprocured  by  the  Government  in  accordance  with  the  national  law  and \nprocedures, or cofinancier\u2019s procurement procedure, if any.  \n \n73.  For the ADB-financed portion, supply contracts for road safety equipment over $500,000 \nwill be procured using international competitive bidding. Contracts below this threshold will be \nprocured using limited international bidding and/or national competitive bidding for contracts of \n$100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  under  the  shopping  method  for  contracts  up  to  $100,000.  Direct \npurchase/contracting  will  be  used  for  procurement  of  road  management  system  software \napplication and training.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n74.  Management Consultant. The existing management consultant, financed by NDF, will \ncontinue  its  service  until  the  end  of  2008.  Thereafter,  an  additional  34  person-months  of \ninternational consultants\u2019 and 218 of national consultants\u2019 inputs will be required under the \nsupplementary  loan.  The  consulting  team  will  be  engaged  following  QCBS  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \n ", "18  \ntime). The terms of reference for the management consultant are outlined in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n  \n75.  Construction  Supervision  Consultant.  The  existing  CSC,  financed  under  the \napproved Project, will continue its service until February 2008. Under the supplementary loan, \nadditional inputs of about 140 person-months of international consultants and 1,040 of national \nconsultants  will  be  required.  The  consultant  will  be  recruited  using  single-source  selection \nprocedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The current CSC is \nresponsible  for  (i)  preparing  the  detailed  design  of  the  four-lane  highway,  \n(ii) assisting RDA in negotiating contract restructuring, (iii) assessing the remaining works of the \nsecond section, and (iv) preparing bidding and contract documents for both the first and second \nsections. The terms of reference for the work to be financed by the supplementary loan are a \nnatural continuation of previous and ongoing work by the existing CSC. Therefore, extending \nthe services of the existing CSC consultant, for supervising the completion of the construction \nworks under the supplementary loan is in the Project\u2019s best interest. This approach will ensure \ntechnical  consistency  and  oversight  continuity,  minimize  required  consulting  inputs,  and \nminimize  liability  risks.  Also,  given  the  historical  issues  of  soil  conditions,  rock  cuts,  and \ncomplexity of the construction contract\u2019s terms and conditions, continuity of the CSC is critical \nand  presents  a  clear  advantage  over  a  new  competitive  selection. The  modified  terms  of \nreference are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n5.  Retroactive Financing \n76.  To ensure continuity of the works and minimize disturbance, the Government may need \nto fund expenditures before the supplementary loan is approved. It has requested retroactive \nfinancing to finance the civil works prior to provision of the proposed supplementary loan. The \nGovernment has agreed that (i) the procurement procedures are to be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; (ii) the expenditures \nto be retroactively financed will not exceed 20% of the proposed supplementary loan and will \nnot be incurred more than 12 months prior to the execution of the loan agreement; and (iii) any \nconcurrence by ADB with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does not \ncommit ADB to finance the project until the Board approves the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n77.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, MOHRD, and RDA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n78.  ADB\u2019s midterm review of the original loan found no indication of any potential fraud or \ncorruption. The Government will continue to ensure that the project funds are utilized effectively \nand efficiently to implement the Project and to achieve its objectives. The Government will \nensure  that  RDA  (i)  discloses  contract  awards  on  its  website,  (ii)  undertakes  necessary ", "  19\nmeasures  to  create  and  sustain  a  corruption-free  environment,  (iii)  ensures  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s Anticorruption Law and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly enforced and are \ncomplied with during project implementation, and (iv) conducts periodic inspections on the \nproject contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. The Government will \ncooperate  with  any  audit  and  investigation,  as  discussed  and  agreed  upon,  and  extend \nnecessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records  as  well  as \nengagement  of  independent  auditors  and  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory \ncompletion of such audits and investigations. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n79.  The supplementary loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil work contracts, consulting services, \nand road safety equipment will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures.  \n \n80.  The original loan was funded from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and therefore, both \nSpecial Funds and OCR resources will be available for the Project. The original loan will be \ndisbursed first until fully committed; the PMU will facilitate this. The original loan will at all times \nand  in  all  respects  be  held,  used,  committed,  invested,  or  otherwise  disposed  of  entirely \nseparate from the OCR loan from ADB.  \n \n81.  The  current  imprest  account  for  the  1999  loan,  which  was  originally  used  for \ndisbursements for black spot improvement and incremental expenditure of the PMU, will be \ncontinued to cover only disbursement of incremental expenditure of the PMU since the road \nsafety  component  of  the  original  loan  has  been  completed.  Once  the  1999  loan  is  fully \ncommitted, a new imprest account for the OCR loan will be established for disbursement of \nincremental expenditure of the PMU. The initial advance to the new imprest account will be 6 \nmonths of the estimated expenditure to be paid through the new imprest account or 10% of the \nOCR loan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure may be used to either \nreimburse or liquidate the imprest advance up to a ceiling of $50,000.  \n  \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n82.  RDA and its PMU will continue to maintain separate project accounts. These statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited reports and financial statements are to be submitted to ADB not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To reach the target, RDA will submit the \nunaudited reports and financial statements to the auditor general within 3 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. The imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will be audited as part \nof the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures will be separate in the auditor\u2019s report. RDA has been made aware of \nADB's policy on delayed submission and of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable \nquality of audited reports.  \n \n83.  The current reporting arrangements will be continued. The management consultant will \nprovide MOHRD, RDA, JBIC, and ADB with brief monthly progress reports based on detailed \nreports prepared by the CSCs of both the ADB- and JBIC-financed sections. When the Project \nis complete, the PMU, assisted by the management consultant and CSCs, will prepare a project \ncompletion report in a format acceptable to MOHRD, JBIC, and ADB.     \n ", "20  \n  \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n84.  Within 3 months of the effectiveness of the supplementary loan, the current benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation system will be improved to a project performance monitoring and \nevaluation system based on the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) in consultation \nwith ADB. Within 6 months of effectiveness of the supplementary loan, the first survey will be \ncarried out in accordance with the new system. RDA will propose key indicators, and data will \nbe compiled in a format developed in consultation with ADB.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n85.  Project  reviews  will  be  conducted  twice  a  year  to  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation.  RDA  will  monitor  project  implementation  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any \nsignificant problems that may result in the schedule not being met. ADB will field a project \ncompletion review mission 1 year after project completion.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n86.  A TA for $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program for \nLand Use Planning of the Southern Highway Corridor. The TA will plan land use and a spatial \npattern  of  development  along  1.5  km  on  each  side  of  the  project  highway.  The  Urban \nDevelopment Authority will implement the TA in close consultation with MOHRD. The overall \nobjectives of TA are to (i) prepare a long-term corridor development plan to guide and regulate \nfuture growth of the Southern Highway Corridor, (ii) set out appropriate strategies to implement \nthe long-term objectives of the Corridor Development Plan and facilitate implementation of \npriority  projects,  (iii)  identify  priority  projects  and  prepare  prototype  project  proposals  for \nintersection area development, and (iv) facilitate implementation of priority projects. Details on \nthe TA and its costs are in Appendix 7.  \n \n87.  A team of consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The TA will be implemented in 12 months starting in June 2008, with input from \nan international urban/regional planner consultant for 6 person-months, and 20 person-months  \nof national consultants comprising an urban/regional planner, to act as deputy team leader; \ninfrastructure engineer; sociologist or socio development specialist; environmental planner; and \neconomist.   \n \n88.  The Government will provide office space, and counterpart staff will be assigned to work \nclosely with the consultant team.    \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Aspects \n89.  The economic analysis was carried out for construction of the four-lane highway. The \napproach follows standard practice of comparing life-cycle road agency and user costs with and \nwithout the Project. The Highway Development and Management Model HDM-4 was used as \nthe basis for the analysis, which focuses on transport cost savings. Value added from better \ntransport links resulting in new industries and employment is not quantified in this analysis but is ", "  21\ncaptured through benefits to generated traffic. The summary of the economic analysis is in \nAppendix 8. \n \n90.  The analysis follows the same approach as was followed when appraising the original \nProject, with updating of the following aspects: (i) traffic growth rate revised upward based on \nthe economic growth outlook, eastward development of Colombo, and past traffic growth trends; \n(ii) vehicle operating costs updated considering the substantial increase in fuel costs compared \nwith other components of vehicle operating costs; and (iii) vehicle operating cost savings to local \ntraffic on A2 considered similar to those for long distance traffic on A2. In addition, incremental \nbenefits of four lanes were taken into account, comparing it with two lanes based on better \nservice,  which  includes  (i)  higher  traffic  diversion,  (ii)  greater  time  saving,  and  (iii)  more \ngenerated traffic for four lanes. The cost estimate is based on the most recent restructuring \nnegotiations for the current contract, including the cost overrun element of the contract. \n \n91.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  as  15.3%.  The  sensitivity  of \neconomic internal rate of return for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit and  cost  streams.  The  following sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  cost \nincreases by 15%, (ii) no benefits to local traffic, (iii) traffic growth rates reduced by 25%,  \n(iv) generated traffic reduced by 50%, (v) accident reduction benefits reduced by 50%, and  \n(vi) overall benefits reduced by 15%. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are \nrobust to various sensitivity tests.  \n \nB.  Financial Sustainability \n92.  RDA will incur maintenance costs comprising operating cost, routine maintenance, and \nperiodic maintenance. The annual maintenance cost without periodic maintenance will amount \nto  $2  million,  or  about  5%  of  the  MOHRD  budget  for  road  maintenance  for  2007.  The \nmaintenance costs will be required after project completion in 2010, and the first periodic \nmaintenance will be required in 2017. Considering the trend in recent years, maintenance funds \nare expected to be available to meet these new costs. \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Aspects \n93.  The review of environmental impacts related to the expansion of the two-lane highway to \nfour lanes indicates that the environmental impacts of the construction will be broadly similar to \nconstruction of a two-lane road. However, an additional construction time of around 2 years will \nbe required, and therefore, the environmental impacts associated with construction such as dust, \nnoise,  water  logging,  disruption  of  access,  etc.  will  continue  until  2009.  The  amount  of \nunsuitable soil that needs to be disposed of will increase by around 400,000 cubic meters. The \nenvironmental impacts related with the operation will include increasing noise and air pollution.    \n \n94.  The mitigation measures recommended by the EIA that have been incorporated in the \nrevised  EMP  need  to  be  properly  enforced  and  monitored.  Requirements  to  implement \nmitigation measures during construction have been incorporated in the civil works contract \naddendum. RDA will continue to be responsible in implementing the overall EMP and monitoring \nthe  implementation of mitigation measures during construction and operation of the highway.  \n \n95.  Although the EIA did not cover the potential environmental impacts associated with \ninduced development along the highway, some environmental impacts could be result from \n ", "22  \nchanging land use. The attached TA will develop a land use plan for the Southern Highway \nCorridor to provide rule and order to, among other things, avoid or minimize environmental \nimpacts associated with changing land use.  \n \n96.  The  recommendations  from  the  social  due  diligence  and  EIA  will  facilitate  project \nimplementation, especially to address environmental and social impacts related to construction \nworks.    \n   \n97.  Since  the  supplementary  loan  does  not  change  the  original  project  objectives,  the \nProject is still expected to contribute to poverty reduction in Southern Province, especially in \nGalle, Hambantota, Kalutara, and Ratnapura districts. The Project will continue to provide equal \nopportunities for women and men. In addition, it will provide measures for preventing the spread \nof sexually transmitted disease and HIV/AIDs. Since this highway will be the first high-speed \nhighway in Sri Lanka, a comprehensive public information campaign on highway use needs to \nbe systematically conducted. In addition, the recommendations from the changes in land use \nstudy need to be adequately disclosed to the public, enabling them to practice appropriate land \nuse control mechanisms along the highway, particularly at interchanges. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n   \nD.  Risks  \n98.  Civil society has been extremely interested in the development and construction of the \nSouthern  Highway.  RIP  implementation  needs  to  be  systematically  implemented  and  any \nunexpected impacts mitigated as quickly as possible. In addition, strict enforcement of EMP \nimplementation  is  necessary  to  avoid  complaints  from  affected  people,  which  could  delay \ncompletion of construction. The contractors will need to strengthen and show their seriousness \nin implementing the EMP and addressing environmental problems associated with its activities. \nPaying  compensation  for  disturbances  due  to  their  activities  will  not  be  adequate;  the \ncontractors need to mitigate environmental impacts from their activities.    \n \n99.  Timely completion of civil works is also at risk if the contractors\u2019 performance is not \nimproved. The work programs need to be monitored systematically and contract obligations \nstrictly enforced.  \n \n100.  All sections of the highway should be completed as it was scheduled, allowing the \nbenefits  to  be  directly  recognized.

The increased cost to complete the original scope of the Project, which is to construct a \ntwo-lane  highway,  is  mainly  due  to  increases  in  construction  works.  Additional  costs  for \nmanaging the Project contribute only 3% of the cost overrun. The increase in supervision \nconsultant costs were covered by reallocating the contingencies from the original project costs. \n \n2.  The approved civil works contract was $87 million. The forecasted project cost for the \noriginal contract is estimated to be $156.6 million, including provisional allowance of $15 million \nfor claims. The summary of the calculation on cost overrun is in Table A3. \n \nTable A3: Summary Calculation of Cost Overrun \n($ million) \n \n    Cost \nOriginal Contract Price  Revised Costs  Overrun \nCost of works (without contingencies  85.40  Cost of works (without  130.40  45.00  \nbut including price escalation of  contingencies but \n$2.50 million, including value-added  including price escalation \ntax of about $7.40 million)  of $2.5 million) \n         \nClaims  0.00  Claims                     15.00  15.00 \n    Value-added tax  14.00  6.60 \nContingencies 3%  1.60  Contingencies  4.50  2.90 \n  87.00    156.50  69.50 \nSource: Roughton International, Monthly Progress Report No. 54, July 2007. \n \nA.  Increased Cost of Works \n \n3.  The  increased  cost  of  works  is  mainly  due  to  undetermined  geological  and  soil \nconditions; and price escalation due to increased prices of bitumen, cement, steel, fuel, and \nhuman resources. \n \n4.  The geological and soil conditions significantly increased the required earth works and \nresulted in unexpected costs for replacing soft soil. The total cost of earth works increased from \n$35.85  million  to  $49.50  million.  This  mainly  reflects  the  increased  amount  of  soil  to  be \nexcavated and preparation of the embankment, including pile embankment; and increased cost \nfor construction of major bridges and concrete underpasses, and for general items such as \noperating vehicles. \n \n5.  The  price  factors  contributing  to  cost  escalation  are  increased  cost  of  construction \nmaterials in the international market resulting in increased prices in the local market, and the \npost-tsunami  construction  boom.  The  data  from  the  Institute  of  Construction  Training \nDevelopment shows that the price of steel increased by 120% during 2001\u20132006, while fuel \nincreased by approximately 100%. Increases in the price of cement have been more moderate, \nat approximately 45%. Labor costs significantly increased over the past 5 years ranging varying \nbetween 50% (skilled labor) and 63% (unskilled labor). \n  \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nB.  Claims \n \n6.  The contractor has submitted 618 claims to date for both time and additional costs; 96 \nhave been converted to variation orders. The total value of claims including additional sums \nclaimed under variations now stands at $11.4 million. Aside from the variation orders, the \nengineer has certified an eligible claim for $1.8 million. The outstanding claims are now being \nprocessed by the Dispute Advisory Board.  \n \nC.  Value-Added Tax  \n \n7.  The original contract was awarded when the value-added tax was 10%. To obtain the \ncontract price, the tax was applied to all pay items in the bills of quantity, except the provisional \nsums. On 1 January 2004, the value-added tax was increased to 15%. The contract permits any \nretrospective increase in taxes to be refunded to the contractor on proof of payment.

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has declared a 3 kilometer (km)-wide corridor \nalong the highway as a special area to be managed under the Urban Development Act. The \nGovernment  has  decided  to  prepare  a  detailed  planning  study  for  the  interchange  of  the \nSouthern  Highway,  to  ensure  that  area  development  can  be  properly  and  transparently \nmanaged. The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to assist UDA in developing guidelines \nunder a development plan for this area, as well as for the 11 interchanges within this corridor to \nsupport  the  development  objectives  of  the  Southern  Highway  and  national  development \nprograms.  \n \n2.  The overall objectives of the proposed study are to (i) prepare a long-term corridor \ndevelopment plan to guide and regulate future growth of the Southern Highway Corridor, (ii) set \nout appropriate strategies to implement the long-term objectives of the corridor development \nplan and to facilitate implementation of priority projects, (iii) identify priority projects and prepare \nprototype  project  proposals  for  intersection  area  development,  and  (iv)  facilitate  the \nimplementation of priority projects.  \n \nB.  Scope  \n \n  1.  Scope of the Study \n \n3.  The study is to help UDA determine the scale and direction of growth of the Southern \nHighway Corridor over the next 20 years. The study will include the following tasks:   \n(i)  Assess the existing situation along the highway and the surrounding towns within \nthe  corridor,  including  demographic  trends,  socioeconomics,  land  use, \ntopographical features, resources, and environmental conditions. \n(ii)  Identify the present transport network within the planning area and its potential \nfor future area development. Identify and locate potential areas for development \nof townships and industrial areas along access roads to the highway. \n(iii)  Develop scenarios of medium- and long-term growth of the corridor taking into \nconsideration the findings of items (i) and (ii).  \n(iv)  Assess a range of realistic standards and standard physical features for future \ncorridor development, including density standards and estimates of the area of \nland required to accommodate future development.  \n(v)  Identify  the  suitability  of  the  area  along  the  corridor  for  various  land  uses, \nincluding  commercial,  industrial,  residential,  agricultural,  tourism,  small-scale \nindustrial villages, and ecological zones with the objective of developing the \ncorridor for efficient land use and functioning of the transport corridor.  \n(vi)  Identify locations for the highway information center, emergency areas, public \ntransport  terminals,  filling  stations,  rest  areas,  and  tourist  information  center \nalong the corridor.  \n(vii)  Identify the impact area of the highway corridor for efficient management of land-\nuse to facilitate operation and management of the highway. \n ", "42  Appendix 7 \n(viii)  Review the adequacy of the corridor at the interchange. \n(ix)  Conduct an initial assessment of the environment and social aspects to provide \nrecommendations for effective land use planning by including the possibility of \nlocal communities to benefit from development of the interchanges. \n(x)  Develop criteria and guidelines for private sector participation. \n  2.  Implementation Strategy \n4.  The consultants have to prepare the implementation strategy by at least covering the \nfollowing tasks: \n(i)  Identify  development  plan  areas  that  are  likely  to  be  a  high  priority  for \ndevelopment purposes, and enumerate key opportunities for land development \nor more profitable land uses, including interchange development plans along the \nhighway. Give special consideration to the proposed Greater Galle Development \nPlan and Greater Matara Development Plan in preparing the future settlement \nplan. \n(ii)  Develop  prioritization  and  sequencing  for  land  development  opportunities \nidentified in (i), and provide a brief profile of each identified area. \n(iii)  Assess resources likely to be available to meet the objectives of the Southern \nHighway Corridor development plan, including public and private investment or \nfinancing resources. \n(iv)  Develop investment promotion plans for industrial estates, tourist destinations, \ncommercial areas, small-scale industrial villages, etc. \n  3.  Priority Projects \n5.  The consultants have to recommend the development plan for priority interchanges in \nclose consultation with the UDA and RDA, and follow the following steps:   \n(i)  Select  at  least  the  three  most  promising  interchanges, and  prepare  detailed \ndevelopment plans for investment decision purposes. The plans should include \nall necessary design aspects including building standards, and ensure smooth \ntraffic movement to and from the highway.  \n(ii)  Prepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each  of  the  interchange  development  areas, \nincluding (a) selection of suitable sites to permit phased development; (b) a \nprofile of the interchange development area, including proposed activities; (c) an \nassessment of infrastructure needs for the proposed development; (d) concept \nplans for the proposed development taking into account a feasible range of \noptions  for  business  and  community  purposes;  (e)  preliminary  design,  cost \nestimates, and benefit-cost analysis; and (f) recommendations for institutional \nand financial arrangements for implementation of the proposals. \n(iii)  Develop an implementation process and schedule. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates \n \n6.  The study will be led by an international urban planner (team leader, 6 person-months), \nassisted by a team of national consultants comprising (i) an urban planner and deputy team \nleader,  6  person-months;  (ii)  an  infrastructure  planner/engineer,  6  person-months;  (iii)  a \nsociologist,  3  person-months;  (iv)  an  environmental  planner,  3  person-months;  and  (v)  an ", "Appendix 7  43 \neconomist, 2 person-months.

The economic analysis was carried out for construction of the four-lane highway. The \nanalysis follows the same approach used for appraisal of the original loan1 for the Southern \nTransport Development Project, and updated the following aspects: \n \n(i)  traffic  growth  rate  revised  upward  based  on  the  economic  growth  outlook, \neastward development of Colombo, and traffic growth trends; \n(ii)  vehicle operating cost (VOC) updated considering the substantial increase in fuel \ncost compared with other components of VOC; and \n(iii)  VOC  savings  to  local  traffic  on  the  existing  coastal  National  Highway  A2 \nconsidered similar to those for long distance traffic on A2. \n \n2.  In addition to these, incremental benefits of four lanes compared with two lanes were \nconsidered based on improved service, such as (i) greater traffic diversion, (ii) increased time \nsaving, and (iii) higher generated traffic for four lanes. \n \nA.  Traffic Volume \n \n  1.  Existing Traffic on A2 and Traffic Growth Rate \n \n3.  The Data Collection Unit of the Planning Division of Road Development Authority (RDA) \ncarried out comprehensive traffic surveys and data verifications during 20 June\u201310 July 2006. \nThe actual growth rates for 1998\u20132006 averaged 6.8% (Table A8.1), while the actual gross \ndomestic product growth per annum was 4.7%.

Economic growth for 2006 was 7.4% and is projected to be 7.2% in 2007. The growth \noutlook for the country\u2019s economy in the coming years is expected to be over 7% with major \nGovernment  initiatives  resulting  in  an  economic  growth  rate  in  the  range  of  7%\u20138%.  The \ndevelopment policy now followed by the Government as outlined in the document Mahinda \nChintana  focuses  on  reducing  poverty,  steering  investment  to  disadvantaged  areas,  and \npromoting agriculture.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Transport Development Project. Manila. ", "Appendix 8  45 \n5.  The traffic growth rate of 6.8% observed during 1998\u20132006 includes local and long \ndistance traffic. The average annual traffic growth rates reported for 1991\u20132006 for all national \nhighways is 8.3% (Road Sector Master Plan Report 2007). With significantly higher economic \ngrowth anticipated for the next 10 years (6%\u20138 %) compared with the last 8 years (4.7%), traffic \nin the southern transport corridor is assumed to grow at least 10%. Therefore, for the present \nanalysis, overall growth of long distance traffic is assumed at 8% for the next 5 years (2008\u2013\n2013), then 6.5% for the next 5 years (2013\u20132018), and 5.5% for the remaining period of \nanalysis. Considering the capacity constraint on A2 as well as likely shifting of development \naway from A2 with the completion of the Project and the observed traffic growth in the last 8 \nyears, the local traffic is assumed to grow at 4% during 2008\u20132013, 3% during 2013\u20132018, and \n2% for the remaining period. These are conservative estimates considering traffic growth trends, \nimproved economic growth outlook, and traffic growth rates considered in the Road Sector \nMaster Plan Report.  \n \n  2.  Traffic Diversion \n \n6.  The average travel speeds on A2 and the project highway estimated from the HDM-4 \nmodel for different traffic volumes indicate higher speed for four lanes in terms of daily average \nspeed. This means that the average speed during peak hours is even lower (by about 20%). \nThe analysis using highway capacity software indicates that A2 is operating at a level of service \nranging from E to F, and the Project with a two-lane standard will fall below service level C when \nthe traffic volume exceeds 15,000 vehicles per day. The average speed on the two-lane-\nstandard project road starts declining beyond 10,000 average daily traffic (ADT) and therefore \nincreased diversion with increased congestion on A2 may not be significant without expanding \nto a four-lane standard.  Additional traffic diversion is considered only with a four-lane standard \nproject highway. \n \n7.  The increased diversion over the analysis period assumes significance when the Project \nis expanded to the four-lane standard, which will maintain a higher speed over the entire range \nof anticipated traffic volumes and the overall perception of the higher speed and safer travel on \na four-lane highway is likely to significantly increase traffic diversion on to the four-lane highway. \nAssuming  at  least  20%  higher  diversion  with  a  four-lane-standard road  is  reasonable;  the \ntransport cost savings to the additional diverted traffic was then calculated.  \n \n  3.  Generated Traffic \n \n8.  The Project is expected to decrease travel times by 24%\u201343% as per the estimates of \nthe 1999 study for long distance traffic. Due to the eastward development of Colombo and the \ndevelopment of outer circular highway (OCH) in continuing the Project, more traffic will have \ngreater  travel  time  savings  and  no  significant  change  in  travel  distance.  Also  the  traffic \ngenerated away from A2 (i.e., interior areas away from the coastal belt) will have little additional \ndistance to travel for using the project highway. The overall VOC saving for long distance traffic \nusing  the  project  highway  will  be  slightly  more  than  21%\u201330%  for  the  analysis  period  as \ncalculated based on the weighted average VOC without considering the additional distance. \nConsidering all these factors, assuming about 25% overall transport cost saving (VOC plus time \nsaving) for long distance traffic is reasonable to assess generated traffic. For the present \nanalysis, a price elasticity of 1.0 is assumed for the four-lane-standard project highway and the \ngenerated traffic resulting from the reduced transport cost thus will be 25% for the project \nhighway. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 8 \n9.  The Hambantota port being developed is likely to induce development in the southern \nregion. Construction has recently started. The traffic estimates in the Hambantota port study in \n2006 indicate significant cargo handling of cement, wheat/flour, fertilizer, vehicles, liquid bulk, \nand containers; and potential for coal transshipment, vehicle handling, petroleum refineries, and \nother port-related activities. The estimates indicate cargo handling at 7 million\u201311 million tons by \n2015 increasing to 23 million\u201326 million tons by 2030. This is likely to generate significant traffic \non  all  links  including  the  project  highway.  Since  this  traffic  is  related  to  production  and \nconsumption in the project influence area as well as reassignment (from Colombo port to \nHambantota) in addition to development-related traffic, it is considered to be part of the traffic \ngrowth, and therefore was not considered for conservative estimates. \n \nB.  Vehicle Operating Cost \n \n10.  The increase in fuel cost, which is a major component of VOC, has been substantially \nhigher than the cost increase of other items and therefore updating the VOC based on the \nconsumer price index alone will result in lower VOC estimates. The economic cost of fuel used \nin the 1999 study is SLRs8.82 for petrol and SLRs8.0 for diesel. The economic cost of fuel as \nper  recent  estimates  used  in  the  2007  master  plan  study  is  SLRs50.56  for  diesel  and \nSLRs54.98 for petrol, an increase of over 5 times; whereas the consumer price index adjusted \nprice increase is only about 1.6 times over the same period. The VOC was updated taking into \naccount the weighting of the fuel component in the VOC and the higher increase in fuel prices. \nA factor of 1.35 for cars and 1.59 for bus and trucks to account for the price increase and \nadditional fuel cost increase were used to update the VOC values from 2007 prices. The \nresultant VOC values for three vehicle types are given in Tables A8.2 and A8.3. \n \nTable A8.2: Economic Vehicle Operating Costs\u2014Rural Roads (2007) \n(6.7 meters, no shoulders, 0.65 side friction) \nVolume of Traffic (vehicles per day) \nFrom  0  11,000  17,000  23,000  29,000  35,000  41,000  47,000 \nTo  11,000  17,000  23,000  29,000  35,000  41,000  47,000  60,000 \nVehicle Type  Vehicle Operating Cost (SLRs/km) \nCar  15.02  15.27  15.51  16.03  16.87  17.29  20.60  21.13 \nBus  27.77  28.77  29.43  30.59  32.92  33.92  41.74  42.40 \nTruck  33.51  33.78  33.87  34.40  35.58  35.93  40.68  41.48 \n SLRs/km: Sri Lanka rupees per kilometer \n Source: Road Development Authority. 2007.

Accident Rates and Costs \n \n12.  Current values for accident rates and costs were obtained from the Planning Division of \nRDA, based on 2005 national statistics. They were compared with the values used in the 1999 \nstudy for the A2 and adjusted accordingly. The assumption used by the 1999 study for the \nimprovement in accident rates for the Project of 40% for two lanes and 50% for four lanes is \nreasonable and is used in this analysis. The improvement is based on the fact that pedestrians \nand cyclists will not be allowed on the project highway (Table A8.5). \n \n13.  During the initial period when the two-lane section funded by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will be complete that, the assumption was that if it were open, no accident savings \nwould be realized. Although the mix of traffic should make the road safer, other factors might \nincrease the risk, particularly as the road would be being widened. \n \nTable A8.5: Accident Rates for A2 and Project \n(per million vehicle-km) \n   Accident Rates \nRDA  RDA  ADB \nAccident  1999 Study Rates \nType  on A2  National Rates  Estimated A2  Estimated Project \nFatal   0.360  1.000  0.360  0.180 \nSerious  2.320  2.320  0.835  0.418 \nMinor     6.715  2.417  1.209 \nDamage only     10.129  3.646  1.823 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, RDA = Road Development Authority. \nSources: Road Development Authority, 1999 study, and consultant. \n   \n                                                 \n2  Beca International Consultants Ltd. in association with Fraser Thomas Partners and Resources Development \nConsultants Ltd.

The 2005 \ndata were inflated to 2006 prices. A comparison was made with the results of the RDA 2002 \nRoad Safety Report and with the values used in 1999 study, bringing all economic costs to 2006 \nprices (Table A8.6). The cost of accidents has increased considerably from the 1999 study, \nparticularly for serious, minor, and damage only. However, a fair degree of consistency exists \nbetween  the  RDA  2002  Road  Safety  Report  and  the  latest  data  provided  for  2005.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nIn Sri Lanka, the recent study shows that poverty reduction has been modest with only about a 3 \npercentage point decrease from 26 in 1990 to 23 in 2002. Poverty reduction has also been uneven, urban \npoverty halved between 1990 and 2002, while rural poverty declined by less than 5 percentage points. A \nnumber of interrelated factors have constrained the poor from assessing opportunities in more dynamic \nsectors of the economy. Lack of infrastructure, especially transport facilities, has caused constraints for \npeople living in rural areas to reach market and growth centers. International experience suggests that \nincreasing transport infrastructure is effective to develop regional growth. Therefore, highway development \nis expected to facilitate improvement, capacity, and efficiency of the road network, especially through \nsegregation of traffic. This will avoid the possibility of the road network becoming a serious impediment to \nnational development. The Southern Highway connecting Matara to Colombo is expected to improve the \ncapacity and efficiency of road utilization and lead to improved movement of good and services to support \nthe country\u2019s regional development through industry, commerce, and tourism. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention\nThe Southern Highway is mainly located in the Southern Province (Galle, Matara districts) and connecting \nto Western Province through Kalutara and touching Colombo District in Kottawa. Two other districts are \ndirectly affected by the Project: (i) Ratnapura District of Sabaragamuwa Province, and (ii) Hambantota \nDistrict of Southern Province.  \n \nThe recent poverty study\u00b9 shows that Southern Province has the highest percentage of the poor compared \nwith other provinces. Except for Kalutara and Colombo, the other districts affected directly and indirectly by \nthe Project rank in the top group of districts with the highest poverty head count. However, the study also \nshows that for Colombo, a large population of the poor live around the border of the city where the Project \nis located. The study also indicates that poor areas are characterized by low connectivity and lack of urban \ncenters other than Colombo. Several factors are associated with a higher probability of being poor; the \nmost important are unemployment including among youth, and underemployment in the informal sector. \n \nThe impacts of the Project will be spread differently over the southern region. The area directly affected by \nthe Project may experience the greatest impacts in terms of creation of direct and indirect employment \nopportunities.  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The  community-based \nassessment carried out during preparation of the original loan shows that the Project will be able to \ncontribute to improvements in economic conditions through (i) improvement of transportation to allow \nfarmers to diversify into higher value crops, such as fruits and green vegetable; (ii) reduction of travel time \nto increase tourist visits, and therefore, seasonal reductions in tourism will be moderate; (iii) improvement \nof access to markets and sources of inputs will lead to expansion of manufacturing; and (iv) development \nof facilities in the interchange will lead to establishment of economic growth centers and formal sector \nemployment. Such improvements are expected to lead to improvements in living standards and quality of \nlife. The following impacts were identified: (i) More remunerative employment and livelihoods will lead to a \nreduction in poverty and unemployment. (ii) The Project will bring long-term solutions to unemployment \namong the youth and females by providing access to education and increasing access to employment in \nnearby centers. (iii) Faster travel will improve quality of life for many families with adult members especially \nhousehold heads working in Colombo. (iv) Buses and transport services will be more frequent and better \nquality. (v) The Project will establish a political momentum leading to improvement in transport and \ncommunication. (vi) Educational institutions will be able to attract better quality staff. (vii) People will be \nable to reach hospitals more quickly.   In addition, the private sector expects  the highway  will significantly \n \n ", "Appendix 9  53 \nimprove attractiveness of the southern region for business and private investment, and contribute to more \nrapid economic growth. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe consultations to disseminate information on the plan for expansion of the Southern Highway from two \nto four lanes and to gather the concerns of people living along the highway were carried out at 20 locations \nin 8 divisional secretariats and attended by around 250 people. Concerns focus more on environmental \nproblems arising from construction works than on social concerns. Among the environmental problems \narising from construction activities are dust, noise, improper cutting of earth that caused damage to \nhouses,  blocked  access,  and  water  logging.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  the \nenvironmental impact assessment study. If these environmental impacts are not mitigated, they could lead \nto  serious  health  problems  and  high  social  costs.  Therefore,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nenvironmental management plan prepared to address these concerns will be implemented and monitored.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Country Gender Assessment Study, 20042 shows that women in Sri Lanka have relatively better \nstatus than women in many other developing countries, but have yet to achieve gender equality. A major \narea of inequality, disadvantage, and gender discrimination is employment. The unemployment rate of \nwomen has been double than that of men for more than three decades, and the quality of employment \navailable to women has been deteriorating as demand for female labor is mainly for casual and low-paid, \nlow-skill jobs in the formal and informal sectors. This problem needs to be addressed from a gender \nperspective  and  incorporated  into  national  development  strategies.  However,  for  direct  employment \nopportunities related to the construction and operation of the highway, the Project will provide employment \nopportunities for both women and men. The Project will ensure that employment opportunities and rates of \nremuneration are determined without gender-biased discrimination and equal remuneration for work of \nequal value.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
