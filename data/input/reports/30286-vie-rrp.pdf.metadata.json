The Project is classified under environmental category B. A \nsummary IEE for the project is presented in Appendix 13.  \n \nThe  Project  involves  water  supply  and  environmental  sanitation \ninfrastructure  development  and  expansion\u2014to  include  water \nsupply, drainage and wastewater, and solid waste management\u2014\nin  the  project  towns:  Phan  Thiet  (Binh  Thuan),  Gia  Nghia  (Dak \nNong), Cam Ranh and Ninh Hoa (Khanh Hoa), Ca Na and Thap \nCham  (Ninh  Thuan),  and  Song  Cau  and  Tuy  Hoa  (Phu  Yen). \nThese  activities  will  be  supplemented  with  public  education  and \nimportance  of  environmental \nawareness  campaigns  on \nhygiene,  its  relation  to  public  health,  and  civic  participation.  The \nProject will help equitize and corporatize public operating entities \n(POEs)  and  improve  their  financial  sustainability  and  operational \nefficiency  through  cost-recovery  mechanisms,  adequate  tariffs, \nand  capacity  building,  as  well  as  suggestions  for  improving  the \nregulatory environment. \n \nfrom  an \nViet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  urbanization  and \nagricultural  to  an  industrialized  economy  has  put  enormous \npressure on already inadequate services, particularly water supply \nand  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure.  Most  recent  infrastructure \ninvestments  are  in  the  northern  and  southern  urban  areas, \nanchored by Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and investments in the \nsmall  and  medium-sized  towns  of  the  Central  Region  have  been \nrelatively  neglected.  The  lack  of  infrastructure  maintenance  and \nflooding, \ninvestment  has  caused  pollution  of  waterways, \nwaterborne diseases, and unhygienic conditions. The region, with \na  poverty  rate  of  38.2%,  is  one  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poorest.  With \nimproved WSS, it is expected that the project towns in the Central \nRegion  will  become  more  productive  and  competitive  and  catch \nup with towns in other regions. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  sustainable  economic \ngrowth  and  improve  the  urban  quality  of  life  in  the  project  towns \nthrough  accessible,  equitable,  and  sustained  WSS  services.

The loan will have a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan agreement. \n \nPart of the loan funds from ADB will be re-lent by the Government \nto POEs to finance water supply development. The detailed terms \nand  conditions  of  the  subsidiary  loans  will  be  further  specified  in \nthe  subsidiary  loan  agreements  upon  terms  and  conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nOverall coordination will be done by a project coordinating unit (PCU) \nestablished  under  the  Management  Board  for  Urban  Technical \nInfrastructure  Projects  of  the  Ministry  of  Construction.  The  PCU, \nwhich  will  be  equipped  with  technical  expertise  provided  by \ninternational  and  national  consultants,  will  liaise  closely  with  ADB \nand  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs)  of  the  five  project \nprovinces.  The  PPCs  will  serve  as  the  executing  agencies  of  the \nProject  and  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  allocating  the  required \ncounterpart \nfor  monitoring  and \nevaluating  project  progress.  A  provincial  project  management  unit \n\nfunding  and  supervising  and \n\n\f(PPMU) will be established under each PPC to manage day-to-day \nproject implementation, prepare withdrawal applications and bidding \ndocuments,  award  contracts,  liaise  with  key  stakeholders,  and \nprepare periodic progress reports. Oversight of project activities will \nbe  done  through  the  provincial  steering  committee,  which  will  be \nchaired  by  the  PPC  vice  chair,  with  representatives  from  relevant \nprovincial  departments  and  key  stakeholders.  The  provincial  Viet \nNam women\u2019s union (VWU) will work with and report to the PPMU to \nimplement public education and awareness campaigns in the project \ncommunities. \n \nThe  PPCs  of  Binh  Thuan,  Dak  Nong,  Khanh  Hoa,  Ninh  Thuan, \nand Phu Yen  \n \nGoods,  works,  and services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2006). \nProcurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PPMUs. \nEquipment  and  selected  materials  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  national  competitive \nbidding  (NCB),  force  account,  and  shopping  procedures,  as \nappropriate. To the extent possible, civil works to be procured will \nbe grouped into packages larger than $2 million to be suitable for \nICB,  while  civil  works  below  $2  million  will \nfollow  NCB. \nProcurement  of  goods  above  $500,000  will  follow  ICB,  while \ngoods from $100,000 to $500,000 will follow NCB. Force accounts \nwill be used for small and scattered water supply and/or drainage \nworks that cannot be defined in advance. Off-the-shelf items and \nstandard  products  costing  the  equivalent  of  less  than  $100,000 \nwill be procured following ADB\u2019s shopping procedures. \n \nConsultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and \ncost-based  selection  procedures \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006).  An  international \nconsulting  firm  in  association  with  a  national  consulting  firm  will  be \nrecruited  by  the  PCU  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedure to assist the PCU and PPMUs in project management and \nimplementation.  Consultancy  services  will  include  project  detailed \ndesign  and  supervision  comprising  engineering,  environmental, \nsanitation, financial, and social aspects; social, poverty, resettlement, \nand  environmental  monitoring;  and  capacity  building  and  training \nprograms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacities  and  improve \noperational efficiencies of POEs and WSS service providers. A total \nof 1,045 person-months of consulting services (93 international and \n952  national)  will  be  required. \nindependent \nresettlement  monitoring  consultant  and  an  auditing  firm  will  be \nengaged using the least-cost selection method and on an intermittent \nbasis throughout the Project. \n \nThe water supply development and expansion works proposed in \nthree  project  towns  will  improve  access  to  safe  water,  increase \ncoverage,  increase  water  distribution  efficiency,  and  reduce  the \nrisk of public exposure to waterborne and water-related pathogens \n\nIn  addition,  an \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nIt  will  also \n\nin  tap  water  in  three  project  towns.  About  13,300  households  or \n58,000 people will benefit from the proposed works. The drainage \nand wastewater treatment works proposed in six project towns will \nbenefit  about  105,000  households  or  461,000  people  through \nsavings  from  reduced  flood  damage  and  losses,  increased  land \nvalues,  and  improved  health,  particularly  reduced  child  mortality \nrates  and  medical  costs  associated  with  waterborne  and  water-\nrelated diseases.  \n \nImproved  solid  waste  management  services  and  facilities  in  three \nproject  towns  will  substantially  clean  up  the  environment,  make \nconditions healthier and safer for waste pickers in landfill sites, and \nsupport  ongoing  private  sector  waste  collection  to  the  benefit  of \n30,700 households. \n \nThe  community  environmental  and  sanitation  awareness \ncomponent will provide targeted, pro-poor interventions to enable \n1,700  households  to  access  water  and  3,000  households  to \naccess  sanitation  services. \nintroduce  good \nenvironmental  hygiene  practices  as  well  as  sustainable \nenvironmental improvements.  \n \nIn  total,  about  114,000  households 1  will  benefit  from  improved \nWSS  and  enhanced  community  health.  The  Project  will  also \nimprove  the  operational  efficiency  and  financial  sustainability  of \ncost-recovery \nPOEs \nmechanisms, \nregulatory \nenvironment.  \n \nThe  Project  identifies  several  risks  to  smooth  implementation, \nincluding  (i)  PPCs\u2019  resistance  to  POEs  becoming  corporate \nentities;  (ii)  unwillingness  of \nimplement \ninstitutional  and  policy  reforms,  including  tariff  adjustments  and \nefforts  toward  greater  transparency  and  accountability;  and  (iii) \nunforeseen  fluctuations  or  macroeconomic  changes  that  raise \nproject costs.  \n \nThe Project will undertake several measures to mitigate the risks: \n(i)  conduct  policy  dialogue  involving  Government,  PPCs,  and \nPOEs on the benefits of a financially-viable and responsive entity, \nand  propose  an  acceptable  timetable  to  corporatize  POEs  and \nadjust  tariffs;  (ii)  identify  and  discuss  incentives  and  options  for \nstakeholders \ninduce  greater  participation  and  sense  of \nownership;  (iii)  conduct  sensitization  workshops  on  project \nobjectives,  scope,  and  activities;  teach  beneficiaries  accounting, \ntechnical,  and  managerial  skills;  and  (iv)  provide  adequate \ncontingencies \nto  anticipate  unforeseen,  adverse  economic \nfluctuations. \n \n\ncorporatization, \ntariff  adjustments,  and \n\nlocal  authorities \n\nimproved \n\nimproved \n\nthrough \n\nto \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n1   Some  households  may  benefit  from  more  than  one  intervention,  e.g.,  water  supply  development,  drainage  and \n\nwastewater, and solid waste management. \n\n\f \n\ntimely \n\nrecruitment \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  success  is  based  on  the  following  assumptions:  (i) \nadequate  and  timely  provision  of  resources  needed  for  project \ncompletion  from  the  Government,  ADB,  and  key  stakeholders, \nparticularly \ntimely \ndisbursements,  and  availability  of counterpart funds  and  qualified \npersonnel; (ii) ability and willingness of the Government and PPCs \nto undertake policy and institutional reforms; (iii) implementation of \nsuggested  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  tariff  adjustments;  (iv) \nproject beneficiaries\u2019 active participation and sense of ownership; \n(v)  support  for  the  Project  from  PPCs,  POEs,  communities,  and \nother key stakeholders; and (vi) implementation of environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement requirements. \n\nconsultants, \n\nof \n\nv \n\n \n\n\fo\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nvii\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nHANOI\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nVIET NAM\nCENTRAL REGION\nSMALL AND MEDIUM TOWNS\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nSOUTH   CHINA\nSEA\n\nSong Cau\n\nTuy Hoa\n\nNinh Hoa\n\nCam Ranh\n\nThap Cham\n\nCa Na\n\nPhan Thiet\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nSOUTH   CHINA\nSEA\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\nCAMBODIA\n\nGia Nghia\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\n06-2034 HR\n\n\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Central  Region  Small  and  Medium  Towns \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2. \nWith a population of 83.2 million and annual urban population growth rate of 3.3%, Viet \nNam is one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in Asia. Despite relatively low urbanization \nof 25%, the high growth rate implies that urban areas will be flooded with 12 million more people \nby the end of the decade. The fundamental aftermath of its transformation from a predominantly \nagricultural  to  an  increasingly  industrial  economy  is  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rise  from  being  one  of  Asia\u2019s \npoorest into one of its fastest-growing countries, where the poverty level of 58.1% in 1993 was \nreduced  to  24.1%  in  2004.1 Economic  growth  has  been  sustained  during  the  past  10  years, \naveraging 7.3% annually, created jobs, and significantly reduced the number of poor. However, \ngrowing  urbanization  has  led  to  higher  population  density,  environmental  deterioration,  and \nincreased demand for infrastructure services, including water supply and sanitation (WSS).  \n \nWater supply production capacity increased from an estimated 1.95 million cubic meters \n3. \n(m3)  per  day  in  1990  to  2.7  million  m3/day  in  2000,  and  over  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  distribution \nnetwork has been constructed within the past 8 years. Still, overall urban water supply coverage \nof the country remains low at 50%,2 ranging from 67% in the larger cities to about 11% in the \nsmaller towns. Low coverage is exacerbated by overinvestment in production capacity, whereby \nutilities operate at 78% capacity and therefore exceed the capacity of the distribution network. \nFinancially,  water  supply  sustainability  has  been  hampered  by  tariffs  that  are  low  relative  to \nincomes and by the lack of substantial investment to expand coverage. The sector analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n4. \nMost urban areas have \"combined\" drainage systems, with coverage ranging from less \nthan 0.1 m/capita in district towns to around 0.2\u20130.4 m/capita in the major cities and provincial \ncapitals, well below the drainage coverage of 1.0\u20132.5m/capita in more developed Asian cities. In \nprovincial and district towns, drains are usually limited to the highways and main roads and are \ngenerally  poor  or  incomplete  as  a  result  of  lack  of  maintenance,  lack  of  investment,  ad  hoc \ndevelopment, and poor design and construction standards. Inadequate drainage systems along \nwith the pollution of waterways poses serious threats to public health and damage to property. \n\n \n5. \nThroughout  Viet  Nam,  about  15  million  tons  of  solid  waste  are  generated  each  year,  with \nmunicipal  waste  accounting  for  80%  and  industrial  waste  nearly  20%,  including  about  1%  of \nhazardous waste. In the next 10 years, the urban population is expected to double, leading to a 50% \nincrease in total solid waste to 22 million tons/year nationwide. Impressive progress has been made \nin collection of waste from urban areas, where 75% on average is collected (70\u201390% in large towns \nand up to 30% in small towns). Of the country\u2019s total of about 100 dump sites and landfills, only 20% \nare of adequate sanitary quality. The rest cause environmental pollution and are a threat to people\u2019s \nhealth and to surface and groundwater systems.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program, 2007\u20132010. Manila. Based on the household living standard \nsurveys, the poverty rate has reduced from about 58% in 1993, to 37% in 1998, to 29% in 2002. The poverty rate \nwas estimated to be about 25% in 2005. \n\n2  USAID, SEAWUN, US-AEP, and OECD. 2005.

Viet Nam: USAID. \n\n\fDuring \n\nthe  past  decade,  Government \n\nDespite considerable gains in indicators for WSS, coverage and quality are not sufficient \n6. \nto  meet  the  growing  demand.  Water  shortages  and  intermittent  service  are  not  uncommon. \nExisting mechanisms for effective delivery have yet to be fully implemented or are impractical, \nand  most  urban  people  have  yet  to  access  the  services.  The  key  problems  that  need  to  be \naddressed in the short to medium term are (i) inadequate investment as only one third of 600 \ndistrict towns have piped water, only a few large and medium-sized towns have sewerage and \nsewage treatment facilities, and cities have no wastewater treatment plants; (ii) public operating \nentities\u2019 (POEs) lack of autonomy, business focus, and customer orientation; (iii) poor operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  infrastructure  systems;  (iv)  lack  of  management  and  technical \ncapacity  of  POEs  and  people\u2019s  committees;  and  (v)  weak  institutional  framework  and  sector \nregulation. \n \ninvestments  and  overseas  development \n7. \nassistance totaled over $1.2 billion to develop new WSS facilities but total investment needs are \nfour times higher. Deteriorating infrastructure and limited Government and people\u2019s committee \nfunds  for  infrastructure  capital  investments  and  maintenance  have  widened  the  gap  in \ninfrastructure  supply  and  demand.  This  is  particularly  evident  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Central  Region, \nwhich contributes the lowest share to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) with a poverty \nrate of 38.2%.  \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  plan  aims  to  accelerate  growth  in  the  Central \n8. \nRegion and make it more dynamic, enabling it to catch up with other regions. Foreign investors \nhave  long  been  attracted  to  the  relatively  established  infrastructure  in  the  Hanoi\u2013Haiphong  and \nthe Ho Chi Minh\u2013Mekong Delta areas. However, in the coastal provinces of Binh Thuan, Khanh \nHoa, Ninh Thuan, and Phu Yen, the small and medium-sized towns are starting to develop and \nhave great growth potential in various sectors such as tourism, fisheries, maritime industries, and \noil refining. The central highland province of Dak Nong has high agriculture and tourism potential. \nTo further develop the region\u2019s potential and ensure sustained economic growth, competitiveness, \nand  livability,  sufficient  investments  must  therefore  be  channeled  to  develop  and  sustain  its \ninfrastructure and make the services available to most, if not all, of the towns\u2019 population.  \n \nA  socioeconomic  household  survey 3 covering  18  candidate  project  towns  in  the  five \n9. \nprovinces  indicated  that  10.4\u201344.9%  of  the  urban  population  is  still  below  the  poverty  line.4 \nPiped  water  is  available  to  up  to  72%  of  the  population  in  the  towns  (compared  with  50% \nnationwide  and  77%  in  urban  areas),  which  confirms  that  demand  for  improved  water  supply \nservices  is  unmet.  Water  shortages  and  intermittent  supply  range  from  6  to  18  hours.  Many \nresidents purchase water from vendors at extremely high prices (5\u201320 times the tariffs for public \nwater  supply).  From  12%  to  60%  of  urban  households  have  sanitary  latrines  (compared  with \n28% nationwide and 72% in urban areas). Urban wastewater discharged into combined storm \nwater  and  sewer  systems  are  completely  untreated,  polluting  nearby  water  courses.  Together \nwith  inadequate  drainage  systems,  this  causes  siltation,  and  with  clogged  drains  causes \nflooding and ponding in the wake of heavy rainfall. \n \n10. \nGovernment sector policy and strategy are set out in separate orientation plans for urban \nwater supply, drainage, and solid waste management, approved by the Prime Minister in 1998 \nand  1999.  The  plans  provide  sector  targets  and  present  Government  reforms  that  aim  to  (i) \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Small and Medium \n\nTowns Development Project. Manila. \n\n4  The  Ministry  of  Labour,  War  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs  (MOLISA)  standard  of  D250,000/capita/month  (2005). \nHowever,  MOLISA  has  raised  the  poverty  line  for  2006\u20132010  to  D200,000  per  month  for  a  rural  resident  and \nD260,000 per month for an urban resident. The overall poverty rate is now estimated at about 26%. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\finstitutions,  (iii) \n\nincrease  cost  recovery \n\ndecentralize responsibility for urban WSS services to provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs), (ii) \nstrengthen  sector \nthrough  user  charges,  and \n(iv) gradually eliminate Government subsidies. The targets of orientation plans for WSS services \nare, by 2010, 95% of the urban population will have access to clean water, 40% of urban areas \nand  70%  of  industrial  zones  will  be  equipped  with  centralized  wastewater  treatment  systems, \n80%  of  solid  waste  will  be  collected,  and  over  60%  of  hazardous  waste  and  100%  of  medical \nwaste  will  be  treated.  However,  the  regulatory  framework  and  mechanisms  to  achieve  these \naims have yet to evolve or be fully implemented.  \n \n11. \n The Government\u2019s sector financing policy aims to (i) adopt full cost-recovery tariffs for \nwater  supply,  (ii)  incorporate  drainage  charges  into  water  tariff  structures,  (iii)  apply  drainage \nand solid waste tariffs sufficient to cover O&M costs, and (iv) gradually increase tariffs to cover \ncapital  investment  requirements  and  reduce  the  need  for  Government  subsidies.  While  the \nauthority to set tariffs continues to be held by the PPCs, the tariff guidelines issued in 1999 and \n2004 (Directive 04/2004) provide the framework and methodology for the PPCs in establishing \nthese tariffs. \n \n12. \nThe key problems that need to be addressed in the short to medium term are inadequate \ninvestment and deteriorating urban infrastructure, low cost recovery for capital expenditures and \nO&M,  lack  of  managerial  autonomy  and  inefficient  WSS  service  provision,  absence  of  a \ntransparent  regulatory  and  monitoring  framework  in  WSS,  and  lack  of  public  awareness  and \ncivic participation in WSS service provision.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n \n\nInadequate and Deteriorating Urban Infrastructure \n\n13.  Most  urban  infrastructure  in  the  small  and  medium-sized  towns  in  the  Central  Region \nwas built decades ago and therefore has not kept up with rapid urbanization and Government \nsectoral  targets.  Existing  piped-water  systems  leak  and  are  in  dire  need  of  repair,  and  many \nresidents,  particularly  the  poor,  do  not  have  access  to  safe  water.  Clogged  drains  and \ninadequate  drainage  have  not  only  caused  loss  of  property  but  also  deteriorating  health. \nLandfills are overburdened, and equipment for collecting, transporting, and disposing of waste is \nlimited.  Despite  substantial  Government  and  overseas  development  assistance  investments  in \nWSS,  the  lack  of  capital  investments  and  maintenance  for  WSS  infrastructure  has  worsened \npoor  services  and  difficulties  in  expanding  service  coverage.  The  lack  of  access  to  WSS \nservices  has  worsened  deteriorating  public  health  and  quality  of  urban  life.  To  ensure  and \nsustain economic competitiveness and livability in small and medium-sized towns, coverage of \nWSS services must be improved and expanded.  \n \n\nLow Cost Recovery for Capital Expenditures and O&M \n\n2. \n  \nGovernment Directive 04/2004 and the 1999 Ministry of Construction (MOC) guidelines \n14. \nfor water supply and drainage provide the framework and methodology for PPCs to achieve full \ncost recovery for water supply and financing that is sufficient to cover O&M costs for drainage \nand solid waste services. However, existing tariff levels do not reflect the cost of production and \nare not sufficient for the long-term financial sustainability needed to generate adequate levels of \nservice. For example, the guideline indicates that drainage charge is to be no lower than 10% of \nthe  total  water  production  cost  but  only  a  few  POEs  apply  the  surcharge.  In  general,  drainage \nfees cover only 30\u201370% of O&M costs while solid waste fees only cover about 30\u201350% of O&M \ncosts  for  waste  collection,  transport,  and  disposal.  The  lack  of  funding  for  capital  investments \nand  O&M  has  led  to  generally  less  sustainable  urban  infrastructure  and  piped-water  supply \nsystems and sanitation services, poor work incentives and capacity of staff, low efficiency and \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\feffectiveness  of  WSS  operations,  and  poor  services.  Although  PPCs  have  the  authority  to  set \ntariffs, there is no specific time frame for applying them, and operational implementation details \nand  a  method  for  calculating  the  required  level  of  cost  recovery  is  lacking.  This  is  a  major \nconstraint on full cost recovery and long-term financial sustainability. Tariffs must therefore be \ncalculated  and  enforced  to  cover  capital  investment  requirements  as  well  as  O&M.  To  make \nservices affordable, targeted subsidies must replace the current blanket subsidies.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLack of Managerial Autonomy and Operational Inefficiencies  \n\nPOEs\u2019  regulating  and  operating  functions  are  bundled  together,  leading  to  conflicts  of \n15. \ninterest  and  little  incentive  for  POEs  to  operate  as  businesses.  The  operational  inefficiencies \nfaced  by  POEs  are  rooted  in  the  lack  of  managerial  autonomy  and  excessive,  centralized \ncontrol,  which  interferes  with  management  and  operating  decisions,  including  the  skills  mix, \nservice  levels,  staff  salary  and  benefits,  and  major  expenditures.  Under  the  2005  Unified \nEnterprise Law, the Government aims to equitize POEs by converting them gradually into joint \nstock companies with 49\u2013100% public ownership or limited liability companies by 2010. This will \ngive  POEs  greater  autonomy  in  business  decisions,  staff  remuneration,  and  raising  capital; \nseparate  them  from  government  administration;  and  allow  for  gradual  reduction  of  subsidies \nfrom  the  state  budget.  However,  operational  guidelines  do  not  exist  and  institutional \narrangements  for  managing  WSS  services  vary  widely  between  provinces,  depending  on \nhistorical,  geographical,  political,  and  other  factors.  Guidelines  based  on  the  2005  Unified \nEnterprise  Law  will  need  to  be  developed,  along  with  capacity-building  requirements  and  a \ntimetable for implementation. To achieve autonomy, gradual efforts must be made to modify the \norganizational  structure,  enhance  managerial  responsibility  and  performance,  and  develop \nindependent business and financial plans.  \n \n\n4.  \n\nAbsence of a Transparent Regulatory and Monitoring Framework \n\nlaxity, \n\ninconsistencies \n\n16. \nPOEs\u2019  poor  performance  and  lack  of  client-oriented  services  result  in  a  general  lack  of \ntrust from residents and a reluctance to pay service fees. Although the direct cause of poor WSS \nservices  is  the  lack  of  money,  the  basic  issues  are  the  lack  of  a  transparent  regulatory  and \nmonitoring framework to improve the performance and financial viability of O&M of WSS service \nprovision.  Outdated  regulations, \nin  enforcing  regulations,  weak \ngovernance,  and  the  absence  of  incentives  for  efficient  service  delivery  will  need  to  be \naddressed when updating existing regulations or issuing new ones.  \n \n17. \nThe development of a regulatory and monitoring framework will need central, provincial, \nand district policy dialogue and reforms. The legislation and monitoring mechanisms need to be \nin place to ensure the sustainability and proper provision and functioning of public services. The \nGovernment  must  also  ensure  that  its  policies  are  mutually  supportive,  resource-efficient,  and \nbring  maximum  benefits,  especially  to  the  poor.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  regulators, \nservice  providers,  and  various  government  agencies  should  be  clearly  delineated  to  reduce \nambiguities.  The  central  planning  and  budgeting  functions  need  to  be  devolved  to  PPCs  but \nregulatory  oversight  and  technical  assistance  capabilities  must  be  retained.  PPCs  need  to \ndelegate  more  autonomy  to  POEs,  which  must  be  transformed  from  subsidized  to  financially \nviable and responsive entities. This will enable POEs to acquire capital investments and O&M \nthrough user charges and be accountable to their customers.  \n \n\nLack of Public Awareness and Civic Participation \n\n5. \n \n18. \nThe  lack  of  public  awareness  and  civic  participation  in  planning  and  managing  urban \nservices  constrains  provision  of  effective  urban  infrastructure  and  WSS.  For  example,  not \nknowing how hygiene practices and health are linked has resulted in deteriorating public health; \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fnot participating in the protection and conservation of infrastructure has led to its deterioration; \nand  not  knowing  the  benefits  of  paying  for  urban  services  and  connecting  to  the  systems  has \ndiscouraged  households  from  connecting  to  and  paying  for  environmental  sanitation  services. \nThe Government and PPCs now realize that their resources alone are not sufficient to provide \nWSS services for all and that public awareness and civic participation are important.  \n \n19. \nImproving  public  health  is  more  related  to  changing  attitudes  toward  investing  in \nhousehold  sanitation  facilities  and  changing  behavior  to  adopt  improved  water  use  and  hygiene \npractices.  For  vulnerable  groups  (the  poor,  female  heads  of  households,  ethnic  minorities  and \nindigenous  peoples,  and  project-affected  people),  accessibility  and  affordability  remain  critical \nissues. Their participation as users of WSS services (through payments, participation in O&M) \nprovides the feedback and support needed to improve WSS.  \n \n20. \nOther  WSS  service  providers  such as  private  water  companies,  water  vendors,  private \ncooperatives, and solid waste management companies constitute another stakeholder category. \nDespite their profit motive, they provide services that POEs cannot. Private sector participation \nwill  relieve  PPCs  of  operational  responsibility  for  utilities,  lower  the  cost  of  services,  and \nincrease access to and improve them. Facilitating a conducive climate for private operators will \ntherefore  expand  and  improve  their  services.  Micro-financing  institutions  could  also  expand \nWSS services. The poor have difficulty accessing micro-credit. Mass social organizations could \nhelp provide them with information on how to do so.  \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n21. \nExternal assistance has been a major source of funding to rehabilitate and expand the \nurban WSS systems. Since the mid-1980s, external funding agencies have lent more than $1.2 \nbillion  to  develop  water  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  projects.  Almost  40%  of \nthis  amount  has  financed  environmental  improvement  projects  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  ($308 \nmillion) and Hanoi ($156 million). In provincial towns, external assistance has focused on water \nsupply  systems,  but  investment  in  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  improvements  in  the \ntowns  has  been  relatively  small,  particularly  in  the  Central  Region.  Besides  ADB,  which  has \nprovided assistance of $330 million, major external funding sources include the governments of \nAustralia, France, and Japan as well as UNICEF and the World Bank (Appendix 3).  \n \n \n \n22. \n \n\nIts experience in the urban and WSS sectors have taught ADB several lessons:  \n\nADB Experience \n\n7. \n\nPolitical  factors  may  hinder  tariff  adjustments  and  the  separation  of  POEs\u2019 \nregulatory and operating functions.  \n\nPolicy dialogue has helped implement institutional and sector policy reforms.  \n\nPeople in unserved areas are willing to pay more than what PPCs or POEs are \nwilling  to  charge,  and  civil-society  support  for  WSS  investments  is  more  likely \nwhen  expanded  service  is  complemented  by  public  education  awareness \nprograms and civic participation.  \n\nThe  provincial  and  town  Viet  Nam  women\u2019s  unions  (VWUs)  play  an  important \nrole  in  implementing  community-based  programs  and  activities  as  they  have \nworked at the grassroots level and possess extensive networking capacity.  \n\nBaseline  surveys  are  valuable  to  assess  the  Project\u2019s  impact  and  should  be \ncarried out during the early stages of implementation.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n23. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSeveral actions are necessary:  \n\nEnsure that the institutional and policy reform agenda is not too ambitious and allows \nfor a reasonable timetable for implementation.  \nImprove POEs\u2019 financial sustainability in two stages: (a) corporatization of POEs; and \n(b)  development  of  an  action  plan  to  enable  profitability,  as  reflected  in  the  entity\u2019s \npositive cash flow.  \nIntegrate  public  awareness  on  environmental  sanitation  into  the  design  of  WSS \ninfrastructure.  \nContinue to involve VWUs in community environmental awareness programs.  \nContinuously build the capacity of local authorities and project personnel throughout \nthe  Project  and  familiarize  them  with  Government  and  ADB  procedures  through \ntraining and workshops.  \nCarry out baseline surveys at the start of the Project.  \n\nTo further ensure project success, the following are imperative:  \n \n\nCentral  and  local  government  and  project  managerial,  technical,  and  administrative \ncapacity should be continuously improved throughout the Project.  \nThe Government should be committed to transparency and accountability.  \nThe Government should show its commitment to the Project by providing adequate \ncounterpart  staff  and  funding  and  approval  processes,  and  by  using  safeguard \ncompliance mechanisms. Unnecessary delays would thus be avoided during project \nstart-up, design, bidding, construction, and conclusion.  \nThe Project should identify the incentives that will increase participation and a sense \nof ownership to ensure better services. The risks and other mitigation measures are \ndiscussed in paras. 73\u201375. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe main project impacts are improved quality of life, sustained urban economic growth, \nand reduced poverty through sustainable WSS improvements. The project area will cover eight \ntowns in the five provinces of Binh Thuan, Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Phu Yen.  \n \n25. \nThe  project  outcomes  are  (i)  improved  access  to  safe  and  sustainable  water  supply, \nadequate  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment,  reduced  flooding  and  ponding,  and  improved \nsolid  waste  management  systems;  (ii)  changed  attitudes  toward  environmental  hygiene  and \nsanitation, particularly increased awareness of the importance of environmental sanitation; and \n(iii) sustainable management and delivery capacities of WSS service providers. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n26. \nThe  Project  will  have  five  major  interrelated  components:  (i)  part  A:  water  supply \ndevelopment  and  expansion,  which  will  construct  headworks,  water  treatment  plants,  and \npumping stations, and expand water distribution networks; (ii) part B: drainage and wastewater \nmanagement,  which  will  construct  interceptor  sewers  and  wastewater  stabilization  ponds  and \nconstruct  and  expand  drainage  networks;  (iii)  part  C:  solid  waste  management,  which  will \nconstruct  and  rehabilitate  landfill  sites,  procure  solid  waste  disposal  equipment,  and  establish \nsolid  waste  management  systems;  (iv)  part  D:  community  environmental  sanitation  and \nawareness,  which  will  promote  public  awareness  of  the  importance  of  good  environmental \n\n \n\n \n\n\fhygiene and sanitation and improve access to sanitation services for the poor; and (v) part E: \nproject management and institutional strengthening (description and outputs in paras. 33\u201335).  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Water Supply Development and Expansion \n\nThis component will expand piped water to the project towns of Ca Na, Gia Nghia, and \n27. \nNinh  Hoa;  increase  combined  water  production  capacity  from  5,000  to  16,000  m3/day;  and \nensure  24-hour  uninterrupted  water  supply  service.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  headworks, \nincluding  10  kilometers  (km)  of  raw-water  pipelines,  construct  three  water  treatment  plants  in \nGia  Nghia  and  Ninh  Hoa,  construct  18  km  of  treated-water  pipelines  to  Ca  Na,  and  provide \npumping  stations  in  the  towns.  Expansion  of  water  distribution  networks  in  the  towns  will  be \nsupported by building 98 km of new transmission and distribution pipes and installing 7,000 new \npiped-water connections. The water supply development and expansion works will (i) increase \naccess  to  improved  drinking  water,  (ii)  reduce  the  risk  of  exposure  to  waterborne  and  water-\nrelated  pathogens  in  tap  water,  and  (iii)  improve  water  distribution  efficiency  by  repairing  and \nreducing pipe leaks and introducing water meters. Baseline surveys at the beginning of project \nimplementation will determine the number of connections needed for inventory and billing.  \n \n28. \nAbout 13,300 households are expected to benefit from expanded water supply services \naside  from  the  improved  services  for  existing  connections.  The  Project  will  ensure  that \naffordability  and  access  for  the  poor  are  adequately  addressed  and  reflected  in  the  proposed \ntariff structure. The Project will also use mechanisms to allow poor households to connect to the \npiped-water system.  \n\n \n2. \n\nPart B: Drainage and Wastewater Management \n\nThis  component  will  improve  drainage,  prevent  flooding,  and  treat  wastewater  in  Cam \n29. \nRanh, Gia Nghia, Phan Thiet, Song Cau, Thap Cham, and Tuy Hoa. It will construct integrated \ncombined drainage systems comprising (i) 112 km of primary and secondary drains; (ii) 92 km \nof  tertiary  drains;  (iii)  5  km  of  pressure  mains;  and  (iv)  20  km  of  wastewater  collection  and \ninterceptor  systems;  and  (v)  four  wastewater  stabilization  ponds  to  temporarily  retain  runoff \nwater from drainage channels in Cam Ranh, Phan Thiet, Thap Cham, and Tuy Hoa. The total \ncapacity of the drainage systems is 17,500 m3/day, with a service area of 23,000 hectares (ha). \nSelection  of  a  combined  drainage  system  with  interceptor  sewers  was  based  on  least-cost \nconsiderations  and  environmental  acceptability.  The  towns  will  benefit  from  the  drainage  and \nwastewater  management  works \nimproved \nenvironmental  hygiene  as  well  as  reduced  medical  expenditures,  (ii)  savings  from  reduced \nflooding  and  property  damage  and  losses,  (iii)  protection  of  infrastructure  and  public  property, \nand (iv) incremental increase in land values. About 105,000 households will benefit. \n \n\n(i)  health  benefits \n\nresulting \n\nthrough \n\nfrom \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Solid Waste Management \n\nThis  component  will  expand  and  reequip  the  waste  collection  and  transport  systems  to \n30. \nincrease collection coverage in Cam Ranh, Gia Nghia, and Song Cau. Three sanitary landfill sites \ntotaling  15  ha  with  a  capacity  of  240  tons/day  will  be  developed,  and  solid  waste  and  landfill \nequipment  will be procured for waste transport and landfill  operations in Cam  Ranh, Gia Nghia, \nand Song Cau. The component mainly involves earthworks for landfill construction, construction of \naccess roads, landfill infrastructure, and small storage stations, together with procurement of solid \nwaste  equipment  for  collection,  transport,  and  O&M.  Solid  waste  management  services  and \nfacilities  will  enable  substantially  cleaner  town  environments.  In  the  landfill  sites,  the  Project  will \nensure  that  WSS  service  providers  introduce  measures  so  that  the  livelihoods  of  waste  pickers \nare  not  adversely  affected  by  the  project  activities.  Male  and  female  waste  pickers  will  equally \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nhave  the  options  of  being  employed  by  the  POEs  or  by  private  solid  waste  companies.  About \n30,700 households are expected to benefit from improved solid waste management. \n \n\n4. \n\nPart D: Community Environmental Sanitation and Awareness \n\nthe \n\nThis  component  aims \n\nto  (i)  promote  public  awareness  of \n\nimportance  of \n31. \nenvironmental  hygiene  and  links  between  good  sanitary  practices  and  health;  and  (ii)  support \ncommunity  activities  to  enable  the  poor  to  access  water,  particularly  sanitation  services,  in  all \nproject towns. The activities will comprise (i) public awareness education campaigns5 for good \nenvironmental  hygiene  practices,  and  (ii)  social  intermediation  and  the  development  of \ninformation, education, and communication initiatives for good environmental hygiene practices \nto  minimize  duplication  of  materials.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  information  materials  are \ngender-sensitive and culturally appropriate, and seek partnerships with other funding agencies \nsuch as UN-HABITAT to enable poor households to access low-cost technology improvements \nin sanitation such as installment of septic tanks, latrines, and household sewer connections. The \nVWU,  with  its  experience  in  working  effectively  at  the  community  level,  will  be  responsible  for \ndesigning  and  implementing  this  component  and  will  report  to  the  provincial  project \nmanagement unit (PPMU). Implementation arrangements and engagement of VWUs are further \ndiscussed in paras. 46 and 51. \n \n32. \npiped water, and 3,000 households will have improved sanitation.  \n\nUpon project completion, about 1,700 poor households are expected to have access to \n\n \n5. \n\nPart E: Project Management and Institutional Strengthening \n\nThis  component  will  have  two  subcomponents:  institutional  strengthening  and  project \n33. \nmanagement. The institutional strengthening subcomponent will provide consultancy services to \ndevelop a time-bound action plan to ensure improved and sustained delivery of WSS services in \nthe  project  towns.  The  Project  will  strengthen  national  tariff  policies  by  preparing  affordability \nand  tariff  guidelines  and  cost-recovery  mechanisms  to  reduce  the  need  for  Government \nsubsidies,  supporting  performance  benchmarking  activities,  and  strengthening  utility  networks \nsuch  as  the  ADB-supported  Southeast  Asia  Water  Utilities  Network.  The  Project  will  help  (i) \ntransform  POEs  into  financially  viable  and  responsive  entities;  (ii)  develop  action  plans  to \nimprove  POE  efficiency  and  implement  them;  (iii)  strengthen  POE  planning  and  management \ncapacities; (iv) prepare standard contracts and guidelines for service contracts and other forms \nof  private  involvement  and  partnerships;  (v)  introduce  measures  to  improve  operational \nefficiency  through  cost  reductions,  decreased  levels  of  unaccounted-for  water,  improved  bill \ncollection,  and  improved  accounting  procedures;  and  (vi)  train  management  and  staff.  The \ninstitutional and policy reform agenda is in Appendix 4. \n \n34. \nThis subcomponent will provide running costs for day-to-day administration, consultancy \nservices  to  help  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  and  PPMUs,6 and  surveys  to  develop  a \ndetailed project design. The subcomponent will also build technical and managerial capacity for \nPCU  and  PPMU  staff  through  skill  training  and  workshops  on  (i)  bidding  procedures  and \nguidelines for procurement of goods and services; (ii) project management, including planning, \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (iii)  financial  management  and  accounting;  (iv) \nenvironmental  sanitation  and  awareness;  (v)  gender  awareness;  (vi)  quality  management  and \nreport  writing;  and  (vii)  technical  aspects  of  sanitary  engineering.  This  subcomponent  is \ndiscussed in paras. 44\u201347. \n\n                                                 \n5   The  environmental  awareness  campaigns  could  target,  among  other  groups,  primary-school  children,  waste \n\npickers, women\u2019s groups, and the youth. \n\n6   The roles and functions of PCU and PPMUs are discussed in paras. 44\u201345. \n\n\f \n35. \nThe Project, together with MOC, will engage in policy dialogue with PPCs and civil society \nto ensure PPC support and greater civic participation. The dialogue will involve discussions on (i) \ndevelopment of action plans for government reform programs and targets set out in the orientation \nplans;  (ii)  relationships  between  people\u2019s  committees  and  POEs,  particularly  with  regard  to \nregulatory  and  operating  functions;  (iii)  the  importance  of  increasing  the  role  of  women  and \nincluding  vulnerable  groups and assurance of  women\u2019s participation in project planning,  design, \nand  implementation,  including  greater  representation  of  women  in  POE  management  positions; \nand (iv) measures to protect the livelihoods, health, and safety of waste pickers.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nCorporatization of Public Operating Entities \n\n36. \nThe Project will support the Government\u2019s State Enterprise Reform Program, which aims \nto equitize POEs by converting them gradually into joint-stock shareholding companies with 49\u2013\n100%  public  ownership.  For  POEs  that  cannot  be  equitized  in  the  short  term,  the  Project  will \nhelp convert them into one-member limited liability companies. This will allow the entity greater \nautonomy  in  business  decisions,  staff  remuneration,  capital  raising,  and  retention  of  earnings \ncollected from customers for O&M expenses. By the end of the Project, POEs are expected to \nbe  financially  viable  as  indicated  by  positive  cash  flows,  allowance  for  gradual  reduction  of \nGovernment subsidies, and selling of shares to the public. As companies are corporatized and \nsubsequently  equitized,  economies  of  scale  and  service  demand  will  be  major  factors  in \ndetermining  POEs\u2019  direction.  The  Project  will  help  restructure  POEs  into  autonomous  entities, \ndevelop  business  plans,  prepare  standard  contracts  and  guidelines,  and  introduce  efficiency \nmeasures in accordance with the 2005 Unified Enterprise Law, with new employment practices, \nperformance-based  staff  incentives,  commercial  focus,  financial  autonomy,  and  improved \nfinancial management systems.  \n \n\nCost Recovery and Financial Sustainability \n\n2. \n \n37. \nTo  enable  full  cost  recovery  and  long-term  financial  sustainability,  the  Project  will  help \nPPCs  develop  and  implement  action  plans  to  improve  sustainability  of  POEs  by  expanding \ncoverage  of  services,  reducing  operating  costs,  and  adopting  tariffs  that  will  enable  full  cost \nrecovery  for  water  supply  and  recover  sufficient  costs  to  cover  O&M  costs  for  drainage, \nwastewater, and solid waste management services. The Project will also help poor households \nconnect to the piped-water supply system, including through deferred payment systems for new \nwater connections and facilitation of grants for building septic tanks and connecting to municipal \ndrainage systems. \n \n38. \nThe Project will provide time-bound suggestions to operationalize national tariff policies. \nIt  will  also  develop  mechanisms  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  function  for  tariff  revision,  which \nincludes  public  participation  by  calculating  fees  for  water  supply,  drainage,  wastewater,  and \nsolid  waste  and  recommending  and  justifying  them  to  clients  and  people\u2019s  councils,  and \nagreeing on service levels with provincial and town people\u2019s committees. \n \n\n3. \n\nParticipation for Improved Management of WSS Services \n\n \n39. \nThe  Project  emphasizes  the  importance  of  community  awareness  and  civil-society \nparticipation in planning and managing urban services and in providing greater access to poor \nhouseholds. The Project will (i) involve VWUs in implementing the public awareness component \nand  ensure  timely  disbursement  of  funds  from  the  PPMUs  to  the  VWUs;  and  (ii)  mobilize \ncommunities  and  introduce  measures  to  help  poor  households  connect  to  the  piped-water \nsupply  system,  including  through  deferred  payment  systems  for  new  water  connections. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThrough  participation  and  sense  of  ownership,  PPCs  will  be  able  to  better  formulate  and \nimplement  improved  sanitation  regulations  and  policies  which,  among  others,  mandate \nwastewater connection to municipal drains and impose penalties on people who do not pay for \nservices  received,  cause  environmental  pollution,  or  impinge  on  urban  infrastructure.  To \nincrease  private  sector  participation,  the  Project  will  also  involve  private  groups,  private \ncooperatives,  and  private  companies  involved  in  solid  waste  management  by  developing \nsimplified  service  contracts.  Through  feedback  from  customers  or  beneficiaries  of  WSS \nservices, the Project will support an independent regulatory body such as the Viet Nam Water \nSupply  Authority  to  evaluate  tariffs  and  recommend  tariff  increases.  The  Project  will  also \ndevelop benchmarking and key performance indicators, which will be monitored throughout the \nProject.  \n \nD. \n \n40. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $66.72 million, of which ADB will provide up \nto $53.22 million equivalent. The remaining amount, to include duties and taxes, will be provided \nby the central Government, PPCs, and project beneficiaries.

The PCU will (i) provide technical support for Project implementation, supervision \nand  training  to  the  Project  provinces  through  Project  consultants,  (ii)  monitor  withdrawal \napplications for disbursement of the Loan proceeds, (iii) monitor the preparation and submission \nof Project financial reports at the provincial level, (iv) recruit an independent auditor and ensure \nthat  periodic  Project  audits  are  properly  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner,  (v)  coordinate  all \nreporting  activities  of  the  PPMUs,  consolidate  reports  and  ensure  timely  submission  of  semi-\nannual reports to MOC and ADB, (vi) monitor and coordinate all Project-related procurement to \nensure  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  (vii)  prepare  and \nimplement training programs for the PPMUs, and (viii) act as liaison between the Government \nand  ADB  with  respect  to  the  Project.  MOC  shall  be  responsible  at  the  central  level  for \ncoordinating  the  Project  implementation,  including  recruiting  and  managing  the consultants  for \nthe  Project,  except  for  Part  D:  Public  Awareness  component  of  the  Project,  through  the  PCU \nunder MABUTIP. \n \nIn accordance with the Government\u2019s decentralization policy, PPCs of Binh Thuan, Dak \n45. \nNong,  Khanh  Hoa,  Ninh  Thuan,  and  Phu  Yen  will  be  the  executing  agencies.  The  PPC  will \nallocate  the  counterpart  funding,  provide  policy  guidance,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  project \nactivities. Within 2 months after the loan effectiveness, each PPC will set up a PPMU under a \ndesignated POE as the implementing agency, which will (i) directly manage day-to-day Project \nimplementation  in  the  Project  towns,  (ii)  supervise  the  Project  consultants  in  designing, \npreparing  bid  documents,  and  construction  activities,  (iii)  manage  the  acquired  land, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard  compliance,  (iv)  implement  the  Gender \nAction  Plan  prepared  for  the  Project,  (v)  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and  financial \ndocuments,  and  (vi)  submit  periodic  progress  reports  with  assistance  from  the  Project \nconsultants  for  submission  to  the  PCU  and  the  respective  PPC.  The  PPMUs  shall  establish \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fresettlement working groups and environmental monitoring units which shall monitor and update \ninformation in their relevant areas of expertise. At least 30% of the PPMU staff will be female.  \n \n46. \nThe  provincial  VWU  will  work  with  the  PPMU  to  design  and  implement  part  D \n(community environment sanitation and awareness). It will report to the PPMU and coordinate \nwith other agencies. At least one person from the PPMU will be assigned to work with the VWU \nto  ensure  timely  implementation  of  activities  under  part  D.  The  VWU  will  be  recruited  by  the \nPPMU through the single-source selection procedure. \n \n47.  Within 2 months after the loan effectiveness, a project steering committee (PSC) will be \nestablished  in  each  Project  province  to  resolve  matters  that  require  interdepartmental \ncoordination  at  the  provincial  level.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  in \neach  province  to  resolve  matters  that  require  interdepartmental  coordination  at  the  provincial \nlevel. The PSC will be chaired by a PPC vice chair, and members will represent stakeholders, \nincluding,  but  not  necessarily  limited  to,  the  provincial  departments  of  finance,  planning  and \ninvestment,  health,  environment  and  natural  resources,  and  construction  and/or  public  works; \nand  women\u2019s  unions.  The  provincial  VWU  will  have  at  least  one  representative  in  the  PSC. \nWhere  relevant,  the  PSC  will  include  a  representative  from  the  provincial  department  of  the \nCommittee \nimplementation \narrangements are in Appendix 6. \n \n\nin  Mountainous  Areas.  The  project \n\nfor  Ethnic  Minorities \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n48. \nIt is estimated that the Project will be implemented over 5 years, commencing in the first \nhalf  of  2007.  To  minimize  delays,  PPMUs  need  to  be  established  and  project  consultants \nrecruited  by  early  2007.  Detailed  design  is  scheduled  for  completion  by  mid-2008,  and \nconstruction  is  expected  to  commence  in  the  second  half  of  2008.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  will  be  conducted  before  construction.  The  water  supply,  small-scale  drainage \nschemes, and the solid waste management components are scheduled for completion in 2010. \nThe large, complete drainage and wastewater schemes with wastewater treatment in Tuy Hoa, \nCam  Ranh,  Phan  Thiet,  and  Gia  Nghia  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  early  2011.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nGoods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006). All procurement contracts will contain anticorruption provisions \nas  specified  by  ADB.  Procurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PPMUs  under  the \nguidance of the PCU. Civil works above $2,000,000 or goods above $500,000 will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and  civil  works  below  $2,000,000,  through \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). Equipment and selected material packages worth $100,000 \nto  $500,000  will  be  procured  using  NCB,  while  packages  under  $100,000  will  be  procured \nthrough  shopping.  Force  accounts  will  be  used  for  small  and  scattered  water  supply  and/or \ndrainage  works  that  cannot  be  defined  in  advance.  Before  commencement  of  NCB \nprocurement, ADB and the Government will review the Government\u2019s procurement procedures \nto  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications \nwill be documented in the procurement plan (Appendix 8). \n \n50. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  to  recruit  consultants \nand  to  procure  goods  and  civil  works.  Advance  action  is  necessary  to  expedite  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action \ndoes not constitute a commitment to finance the Project. \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n51. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006).  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  in  association  with  one  or  more  national  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited by the PCU using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure and will assist the \nPCU  in  overall  project  management.  Consultancy  services  will  include  project  detailed  design \nand  supervision,  comprising  engineering,  environmental,  sanitation,  financial,  and  social \naspects;  social,  poverty,  resettlement,  and  environmental  monitoring;  capacity  building  and \ntraining programs to strengthen the institutional capacities and improve operational efficiencies \nof POEs and WSS service providers. A total of 1,045 person-months of consulting services (93 \ninternational  and  952  national)  will  be  required.  In  addition,  (i)  an  independent  resettlement \nmonitoring  consultant  will  be  engaged,  on  an  intermittent  basis,  using  the  least-cost  selection \nmethod;  and  (ii)  VWUs  will  be  engaged  through  single-source  selection  to  implement  part  D \n(community  environmental  and  sanitation  awareness).  The  least-cost  selection  method  is \njustified because the assignment is relatively small, and practices and standards for conducting \npoverty  impact  assessments  are  well  established.  Single-source  selection,  despite  not  having \nthe  benefits  of  competition  for  quality  and  cost,  is  proposed  because  the  VWUs  engage  in \ngrassroots  activities  and  have  exceptionally  extensive  networks.  The  estimated  staffing \nrequirement is in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nThe  Government  shall  comply  with,  and  shall  cause  the  PPCs  and  the  POEs,  as \napplicable,  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy.  7 The  Government  (i)  acknowledges \nADB\u2019s  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Project; and (ii) agrees to cooperate fully with, and \nto cause the PPCs and POEs, as applicable, to cooperate fully with any such investigation and \nto extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all relevant books and records, \nas may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation.  \n \n53. \nIn  addition  to  these  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  the \nGovernment  shall  maintain  the  procurement  website  to  disclose  information  about  public \nprocurements,  including  those  related  to  the  Project.  For  each  contract,  the  website  shall \ninclude  information  on,  among  others,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of \ngoods/services procured. In addition to the web-based disclosure, stakeholders, which include \ncivil society and non-governmental organizations, shall be provided detailed information on each \nPPMU-level procurement on public notice boards in their respective provinces. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n54. \nHandbook. Six imprest accounts\u2014one for the PCU and five for the PPMUs of Binh Thuan, Dak \nNong,  Khanh  Hoa,  Ninh  Thuan,  and  Phu  Yen\u2014will  be  established  in  non-interest-bearing \ncurrent  accounts  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to  expedite  project  implementation \nthrough  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds.  The  advance  to  each  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed 10% of the allocation for the PCU or the 6-month forecast expenditure for each PPMU. \nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and \nADB;  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 1998.

The procedure will apply \nto contracts not exceeding $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nDetailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PCU and PPMUs, \n55. \nwill be audited by qualified and independent auditors acceptable to ADB and will be submitted to \nADB,  in  English,  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  annual  audit  report  will \ninclude the audit of the imprest accounts and the statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n56. \nThe  PCU  will  consolidate  quarterly  implementation  reports  sent  by  PPMUs  and  submit \nsemiannual  progress  reports  to  ADB.  The  PCU  will  ensure  that  the  PPMUs  conduct  timely \nbaseline physical and socioeconomic surveys. A baseline survey will be undertaken early during \nimplementation  to  collect  and  analyze  data  on  the  relevant  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nreporting  purposes  and  will  be  compared  against  the  targets  achieved  during  project \ncompletion. The performance indicators will include but not be limited to (i) service coverage, (ii) \nunaccounted-for water, (iii) production capacity, (iv) staff and working ratios, and (v) billing and \ncollection efficiency. Semiannual progress reports will describe physical progress, details of any \nchange  in  schedule,  implementation,  progress  against  the  gender  action  plan,  updates  on \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  and  resettlement  plans,  use  of  loan  proceeds,  and  an \noutline of the work for the next 6 months. The report will provide summary financial accounts of \nthe  Project,  including  expenditure  during  the  period,  year-to-date  expenditure,  and  total \nexpenditure  to  date.  The  PCU  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  physical  project \ncompletion, a project completion report covering the details of implementation, costs, monitoring \nand evaluation, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n57. \nThe  PCU  will  ensure  that  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  is  established \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. It will track project implementation activities, target dates, \nexpected  outcomes,  and  assigned  responsibilities.  A  post-resettlement  evaluation,  by  an \nindependent  consultant,  will  be  undertaken  once  all  project  resettlement  activities  have  been \ncompleted. The indicators to be monitored will be formulated, discussed, and agreed by ADB, \nPPCs, and municipal corporations. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the PCU will conduct \ninitial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan \nfor benchmarking information and monitoring performance. This will be subject to ADB\u2019s review \nand  concurrence.  The  PCU  will  submit  annual  reports \nthroughout  project \nimplementation. \n \n\nto  ADB \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nProject performance will be reviewed by the PCU, PPCs and ADB. The first-level review \nwill be conducted every quarter by the PCU. It will be based on performance reports prepared \nby  the  PPMUs.  The  monthly  reports  on  project  performance,  major  policy  issues,  and  actions \nrequired or taken by the respective authorities will be reviewed. The report will be sent to MOC \nand  the  PPCs  for  their  action.  The  second-level  review  will  be  conducted  by  ADB  review \nmissions  every  6  months  throughout  the  Project.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be \ncarried out 36 months after the date of loan effectiveness to identify problems or weaknesses in \nimplementation arrangements and to agree on  any corrective  measures. A final review will be \nconducted by an ADB mission towards the end of the project. \n \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  eight  towns  by  providing  piped  water  and \nimproving  environmental  conditions.  By  2011,  it  will  benefit  about  105,000  households  or \n501,000 people, of whom 10,400 households or 45,300 people are poor. Safe and reliable piped \nwater  will  help  lower  water  costs,  save  time,  and  improve  health.  Better  drainage  and  solid \nwaste collection systems will help eliminate standing rain and storm water and unsanitary solid \nand  liquid  waste  disposal.  Hygiene  awareness  and  promotion  will  complement  the  Project\u2019s \nphysical investments. Infants, women, and the elderly, who are more susceptible to waterborne \ndisease and environment-related illness, will benefit the most.  \n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  the  risk  of  increased  impoverishment  associated  with  the \nhigh  cost  of  health  care.  The  poor  and  near-poor  suffer  most  because  of  weak  urban \ninfrastructure  and  unsanitary  conditions.  They  are  often  forced  to  sell  their  income-generating \nassets  and  lose  work  days  because  of  sickness\u2014their  own  or  a  family  member\u2019s.  Part  D \nsupports poor households that cannot afford the connection fee to a water supply and drainage \nsystem and have poor toilet facilities. These interventions aim to facilitate access by the poor to \nsafe  water  and  improved  sanitation  facilities.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nGender Impact \n\n61.  Women are responsible for a variety of household and community WSS tasks. They are \nresponsible  for  household  water  supply  and  use,  including  family  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and \nmake up most solid waste collectors. Distance to the nearest water source is less of a problem \nfor  urban  than  rural  women  as  many  households  in  the  project  towns  purchase  water  from \nvendors and/or use rain-harvesting systems. Women will benefit mainly from increased cost and \ntime  savings  and  improved  family  health  and  hygiene.  Women  represent  about  one  third  of \nemployees  in  the  public  utility  companies  surveyed  and  are  often  underrepresented  in \nmanagement  positions.  The  Project  will  help  public  utility  companies  in  the  project  towns \ndevelop and implement steps (providing access to training and posting job announcements) to \nincrease the number of female employees, especially in management. The PPMU will contract \nthe provincial VWU to implement part D. VWUs will be represented in the PSCs and help deliver \ngender awareness training in the provincial PSC and POE and the PPMU. At least 30% of the \nPPMU staff will be female. A gender analysis and action plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities \n\n62.  Most people in the project area are Kinh. Ethnic minorities live in Thap Cham (1.2%) and \nGia  Nghia  (35.3%)  but  rarely  in  urban  areas.  Specific  actions  have  been  integrated  into  the \nproject  design  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  have  equal  access  to  project  benefits,  have \nculturally appropriate awareness and education materials, and are safeguarded against adverse \nproject  impacts.  Under  part  D,  public  awareness  campaigns  on  water  use  and  hygiene  will \nreflect ethnic differences in knowledge and practice. Ethnic minorities will be equally eligible for \nassistance to household water supply connection and sanitation facilities. The PSC established \nin Gia Nghia will include a representative from the provincial department of the Committee for \nEthnic Minorities in Mountainous Areas. Provisions have been included in resettlement plans to \nensure  that  ethnic  minorities  receive  equal  compensation,  additional  support  for  rehabilitation, \nand asset transfers that help retain the high status of Ma and Edde women. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n4. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n63. \nThe  Project  will  require  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  people  in  eight  project \ntowns. Impact on private households and agricultural land will be minimal. An estimated 59 ha \nwill  be  lost  because  of  improvements  in  drainage  and  flood  protection,  wastewater  and \nsanitation,  and  solid  waste  infrastructure;  154  households  will  be  severely  affected  either  by \ndisplacement of housing or shops or loss of 10% or more of productive land, and 48 households \nwill  be  marginally  affected  (a  total  of  202  households  or  894  people).  Involuntary  resettlement \neffects  will  be  most  severe  in  or  near  landfill  areas,  wastewater  treatment  plants,  and \nwastewater  stabilization  ponds.  During  project  design,  efforts  were  made  to  avoid  and,  where \npossible,  minimize  the  impact  through  consultations  with  local  authorities.  Some  households \nand businesses may be temporarily affected during construction by pipe laying.  \n \nResettlement  plans  for  each  province  were  prepared  according  to  Government \n64. \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement 8  and  in  consultation  with  local \ncommunities  and  authorities.  The  plans  cover  project  components  able  to  do  the  basic \nresettlement-planning  activities  of  census,  inventory  of  losses,  and  socioeconomic  surveys. \nSome  provincial  components  are  unable  to  do  these  at  this  stage  and  so  a  resettlement \nframework has been prepared to guide resettlement planning and implementation after detailed \ndesign.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  and  framework  are  in  Appendix  12.  The  resettlement \nframework and five resettlement plans are supplementary appendixes. A total of $2.11 million is \nestimated for all project resettlement costs, including implementation costs and contingencies. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nInitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  undertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy \n65.  \nand  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  reports  prepared  for  each  province  to \nscreen  the  environment,  assess  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  investments,  and  propose \nmitigation measures and institutional arrangements. All IEEs concluded that the Project may lead \nto  temporary  and  reversible  localized  negative  impacts  but  foresaw  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  To  minimize  adverse  impacts,  if  any,  the  Project  will  involve \ncommunities  and  other  stakeholders  in  project  planning,  design,  and  implementation.  For  the \nproposed  landfill  sites  for  Gia  Nghia  and  Cam  Ranh,  buffer  areas  will  be  provided  to  ensure \nsufficient soil cover. Periodic monitoring and inspection will be conducted to maintain daily soil \ncover after disposal of wastes. Waste pickers will be allowed to recover recyclable wastes at the \nseparation area adjacent to the landfill site and participate in income-generating opportunities. \nPotential  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are  generation  of  dust  and  noise;  soil \nerosion  caused  by  excavation;  and  surface  and  groundwater  contamination  by  spoil,  oil  and \ngrease,  and  wastes.  Mitigating  measures  can  be  instituted  without  difficulty  through  careful \nmonitoring by PPMU and involving communities. Therefore, no further study or detailed EIA is \nneeded.  \n \n66. \nIntegrated WSS management will provide sustainable prospects for reducing waterborne \ndiseases,  improving  water  quality  and  hygiene,  reducing  incidence  of  flooding,  and  improving \nliving  conditions,  which  far  outweigh  negative  impacts.  The  environmental  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 13. A summary IEE describing the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and \nmonitoring plans is in Supplementary Appendix F, while subproject IEEs are in Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n \n \n\n \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n67. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply \nProjects. The analysis comprises least-cost and cost\u2013benefit analyses for the water supply and \ndrainage  and  wastewater  components,  while  the  solid  waste  and  community  environmental \nsanitation  and  awareness  components  were  examined  using  the  cost-effectiveness  criteria. \nApproaches are combined because of the uncertainties and difficulties of quantifying health and \nenvironmental benefits.  \n \n68. \nThe major economic benefits arising from improved WSS are (i) time and cost savings in \nobtaining  water,  and  health  benefits  accruing  to  the  residents  because  of  improved  and \nexpanded  coverage  of  water  supply;  and  (ii)  health  benefits  accruing  to  the  residents,  cost \nsavings because of reduced flood damage and losses, and annualized incremental increase in \nthe  values  of  affected  land  because  of  improved  drainage  and  wastewater  management.  The \ncommunity  environmental  sanitation  and  awareness  component  is  expected  to  generate \nsignificant  pro-poor  benefits  in  the  form  of  improved  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices  through \nbetter awareness of and access to WSS facilities.  \n \n69. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  has  been  calculated  for  the  water  supply \nand  drainage  components  of  each  project  town.  The  results  of  the  overall  economic  analysis \nindicate that the base case for the project EIRRs is calculated at 20.87%, where the EIRR for \nwater supply is 15.56% and for drainage 22.49%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the overall \nEIRR is most sensitive to the actual values of the realized benefits and to delays in the receipt \nof such benefits. The poverty impact ratio is calculated at 29.92%, which is above the 12.60% \nestimated  average  share  of  the  poor  in  GDP  for  Viet  Nam,  reflecting  the  Project\u2019s  pro-poor \nthrust. The economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nThe  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \n70. \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects. It is based on the estimated required average \ntariffs to achieve full cost recovery for all components. This is achieved by calculating the average \nincremental  financial  cost:  (i)  the  present  values  of  capital  and  O&M  costs  at  financial  prices \ndivided by the present value of the volume of water sold for the water supply component, (ii) water \nsales equivalent as a proxy for the drainage and wastewater treatment component, and (iii) solid \nwaste collected for each year over the life of the components. A recommended tariff structure was \nthen devised and incorporated further affordabilities, segmenting different user groups. \n \n71. \nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  calculated  for  the  water  supply  and \nsolid waste components and compared with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The \nFIRRs  are  3.9\u20137.0%  (water  supply)  and  7.8\u201311.7%  (solid  waste  management),  all  above  the \nestimated project WACC of 2.0%. The drainage and wastewater component is not considered to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenue  to  have  positive  FIRRs  and  needs  to  be  subsidized  by  the \nGovernment. Even so, a 10% surcharge on water bills is proposed to help recover O&M costs, \nnot capital expenditures. \n \n72. \nThe  financial  estimations  were  based  on  payments  of  5%  of  household  incomes,  cross \nsubsidies, and a willingness to pay of 6.5%. The financial projections prepared for all eight towns \nindicate that the financial performance will improve over the 2009\u20132020 forecast period as tariffs \nfor  the  services  increase.  The  Government\u2019s  budget  to  support  the  services  will  be  gradually \nreduced and finally eliminated in 2014. The summary financial analysis is in Appendix 15.  \n \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n73. \nSeveral  risks  were  identified:  (i)  resistance  of  existing  PPCs  to  POEs\u2019  becoming \ncorporate entities; (ii) lack of willingness of local authorities to implement institutional and policy \nreforms, including tariff adjustments and efforts toward greater transparency and accountability; \nand  (iii)  unforeseen  macroeconomic  fluctuations  or  change,  which  will  raise  project  costs. \nSeveral challenges face the project: (i) lack of stakeholders\u2019 understanding of project objectives; \n(ii)  lack  of  capacity  of  people\u2019s  committees  and  WSS  service  providers;  (iii)  the  PPCs\u2019  and \nPOE\u2019s lack of familiarity with ADB and Government procurement and disbursement procedures, \ndelaying  project  implementation;  and  (iv)  poor  households\u2019  inability  to  benefit  from  the  project \ninvestments.  \n \n74.  \nTo  mitigate  the  risks  and  challenges,  several  measures  are  proposed:  (i)  undertake \npolicy  dialogue  involving  the  Government,  PPCs,  and  POEs  on  the  benefits  of  a  financially \nviable  and  responsive  entity;  (ii)  propose  a  timetable  for  corporatizing  POEs  and  adjusting \ntariffs;  (iii)  identify  and  discuss  incentives  and  options  for  stakeholders  to  induce  greater \nparticipation and sense of ownership; (iv) conduct sensitization workshops on project objectives, \nscope,  and  activities;  (v)  provide  contingencies  to  anticipate  unforeseen,  adverse  economic \nfluctuations;  (vi)  provide  training  in  accounting,  technical,  and  managerial  skills,  and  in \nGovernment and ADB guidelines on procurement, disbursements, and project management for \nproject  staff;  and  (vii)  devise  mechanisms  such  as  deferred  payment  schemes  to  enable  the \npoor to connect with the water supply system and sanitation services. \n \n75. \nThe  costs  are  expected  to  be  outweighed  by  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts:  (i) \nenhanced  environmental  sanitation  and  public  health  (particularly  reduced  water-related  and \nwaterborne diseases); (ii) reduced or eliminated flooding; and (iii) socioeconomic growth, which is \nexpected to pressure local authorities to meet rising demand for basic infrastructure services. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  PPCs  have  given  the \n\n \n76. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  shall:  (a)  establish  the  PCU  within  MABUTIP  within  1  month \nafter the effective date, (b) cause the PPCs to set up a PPMU within each Project \nprovince  within  2  months  after  the  effective  date,  and  (c)  cause  the  PPCs  to \nestablish a PSC in each Project province within 2 months after the effective date. \n\nThe Government shall ensure that (a) implementation regulations for the Unified \nEnterprise Law (2005) are prepared and adopted by the relevant agencies of the \nGovernment in a timely manner in order to facilitate effective corporatization and \nequitization of the POEs;

(b) training programs to improve staff capabilities; \n(c) improved accounting procedures; and (d) O&M plans and procedures.  \n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  PPCs  adopt  tariffs,  immediately  upon \ncommissioning of the Project facilities that provide full cost recovery in the case \nof water supply, and recover sufficient costs to cover full O&M costs in the case \nof drainage, wastewater and solid waste management services. \n\nThe Government shall cause the PPCs to allocate the counterpart funds, at the \nprovincial level, required for the Project from the respective PPCs\u2019 annual budget \nin a timely manner and in accordance with the Government\u2019s Budget Law (2002). \n\nThe  Government  shall  cause  the  PPCs  to  (a)  carry  out  the  resettlement  plans \nprepared for the Project provinces in an effective and timely manner; (b) update \nthe resettlement plans based on the final technical design, in accordance with the \nresettlement framework prepared for the Project and with prior approval of ADB; \nand  (c)  prepare,  revise,  implement  and  monitor  the  resettlement  plans  in \naccordance with the related regulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  (1995)  and  other  related  requirements.  Provisions  and \nprinciples adopted in the resettlement framework and the resettlement plans shall \nsupersede  the  provisions  of  Government\u2019s  regulations  wherever  there  is  a \nconflict or gap. \n\nThe  Government  shall  cause  the  PPCs  to  ensure  that  the  gender  action  plan \nprepared  for  the  Project  is  fully  implemented  and  monitored  in  accordance  with \nits  terms,  related  Government  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment  (2003)  in  a  timely  manner,  and  adequate  resources  are  allocated \nfor  this  purpose.  In  particular,  the  Government  shall  ensure  that  (a)  female-\nheaded  households  are  eligible  for  equal  compensation  and  additional  support \nmeasures  for  rehabilitation;  (b)  in  ethnic  minority  groups  where  women  hold \nhigher  status  than  men,  such  status  is  maintained  where  asset  transfers  are \nconcerned; (c) at least 30% of each PPMU staff are female; and (d) at least one \nmember of the PSC in each Project province is a member of the provincial VWU.  \n\n \n\n(viii)   The Government shall cause the PPCs to ensure that (a) ethnic minorities have \nequal access to the Project benefits, have culturally appropriate awareness and \neducation  materials,  and  are  safeguarded  against  adverse  impacts;  (b)  the \nspecific actions indicated in the resettlement plans for ethnic minorities, including \ntheir  customary  rights  to  forest  products,  are  fully  implemented  in  accordance \nwith the relevant terms of the respective resettlement plans, related Government \nregulations and ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples (1998) in a timely manner, \nand  that  adequate  resources  are  allocated  for  this  purpose;  and  (c)  where \nrelevant,  the  PSC  concerned  includes  a  representative  from  the  provincial \ndepartment of community for ethnic minorities in mountainous areas (CEMMA). \n\n \n\n(ix)  \n\nThe  Government  shall  cause  the  PPCs  to  ensure  timely  flow  of  funds  from  the \nPPMUs  to  the  VWUs  allocated  for  the  Project  activities  under  Part  D.  The \nGovernment  shall  also  ensure  that  (a)  the  VWUs  work  effectively  with  the \nrespective  PPMUs  to  implement  the  community  environmental  sanitation  and \npublic  awareness  campaigns  under  Part  D,  (b)  at  least  50%  of  the  motivators \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(x)  \n\nselected for the public awareness campaign are female, and (c) at least 30% of \nthe  teams  formed  to  discuss  the  Project  with  communities  are  composed  of \nfemale members. \n\nThe Borrower shall ensure that adverse environmental impacts of the Project are \nminimized.  In  particular,  the  Borrower  shall,  through  the  PPCs,  cause  (a)  the \nPPMUs  and  the  relevant  authorities  to  monitor  and  supervise  the  construction \nactivities  to  minimize  short-term  adverse  impacts  by  adopting  appropriate \nmitigation measures and good engineering and construction practices, including \nreplanting  of  trees,  ensuring  working  safety,  sanitation  and  health  care  of \nworkers;  (b)  the  existing  O&M  manual  and  emergency/inspection  plans  to  be \nreviewed  and  revised,  as  needed,  to  improve  the  operation  performance  for \ndelivery of safe drinking water and minimize a potential risk overflow and flooding \nof  raw  sewage;  (c)  surface  and  ground  water  quality  testing  to  be  conducted \nregularly  to  ensure  compliance  with  drinking  water  quality  and  wastewater \nstandards,  and  detect  any  sign  of  ground  water  contamination;  (d)  periodic \nmonitoring and inspection to be conducted to maintain daily soil cover of landfill \nsites;  (e)  waste  pickers  to  be  employed  to  recover  recyclable  wastes  at  the \nseparation  area  adjacent  to  the  landfill  sites  and  to  provide  income  generation \nopportunities; and (f) an EMU to be set up within each PPMU to be responsible \nfor implementation of environmental mitigation measures and monitoring.  \n\n(xi) \n\nThe Government shall comply with, and shall cause the PPCs and the POEs, as \napplicable,  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  (1998).

Over  the  past  decade,  the  Government,  with  Official  Development \nAssistance, has invested over $1 billion to develop new water production and distribution facilities. \nProduction capacity increased from an estimated 1.95 million m3/day in 1990 to 2.7 million m3/day \nin 2000, and over 50% of the country\u2019s distribution network has been constructed within the past 8 \nyears. Yet, overall urban water supply coverage of the country remains low at 50%,1 ranging from \n67%  in  the  larger  cities  to  about  11%  in  the  smaller  towns.  Low  coverage  is  exacerbated  by \noverinvestment  in  production  capacity,  whereby  utilities  operate  at  78%  capacity  and  therefore \nexceed the capacity of the distribution network. Financially, water supply sustainability has been \nhampered  by  low  tariffs  relative  to  incomes  and  the  need  for  substantial  investment  to  expand \ncoverage.  Most  water  supply  companies  recover  at  least  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \ncosts, with an average working ratio close to 0.7. However, few if any companies achieve full cost \nrecovery, based on properly calculated depreciation levels. The average collection period of less \nthan  30  days  and  metering  practices  of  95%  are  very  good.  However,  much  of  the  distribution \nsystem  is  in  poor  condition;  low  water  tariffs  and  lack  of  accountability  have  provided  little \nincentive  to  maintain  the  distribution  network.  A  concerted  program  has  succeeded  in  reducing \nunaccounted-for water from 38.5% in 2000 to 34.0% in 2004. Many small water supply systems \nprovide intermittent supply, averaging 17 hours of service per day. \n \n2.  Drainage  and  Wastewater. External assistance for the sector over the past decade has \nfocused  on  water  supply,  covering  59  cities  and  provincial  towns  in  the  61  provinces,  while \ninvestments in drainage, sanitation, and solid waste improvement in provincial and district towns \nhas  been  relatively  small.  Most  urban  areas  in  Viet  Nam  have  \"combined\"  drainage  systems, \nwith coverage ranging from less than 0.1 m/capita in district towns to around 0.2\u20130.4 m/capita in \nthe major cities and provincial capitals, well below the drainage coverage of 1.0\u20132.5 m/capita in \nmore  developed  Asian  cities.  In  provincial  and  district  towns,  drains  are  usually  limited  to  the \nhighways  and  main  roads,  and  where  drains  exist  they  are  generally  poor  or  incomplete  as  a \nresult  of  lack  of  maintenance,  lack  of  investment,  ad  hoc  development,  and  poor  design  and \nconstruction. About 75% of households in provincial towns and 25\u201350% in district towns have \nseptic tanks, but only a small portion are connected to sewers or drains. In many urban areas, \nseptic  tanks  provide  only  partial  treatment  of  wastewater  because  they  are  not  constructed  to \nsuitable  standards,  causing  septic  tank  effluent  or  seepage,  which  pollutes  surface  water  and \ngroundwater in populated areas.  \n \nSolid Waste Management. Throughout Viet Nam, about 15 million tons of solid waste are  \n3. \ngenerated each year, with municipal waste accounting for 80% and industrial waste nearly 20%, \nincluding about 1% of hazardous waste. In the next 10 years, the urban population is expected \nto  double,  leading  to  a  50%  increase  in  the  national  total  solid  waste  to  22  million  tons/year. \nImpressive progress has been made in collection of waste from urban areas, where on average \n75%  is  collected,  with  a  range  of  70\u201390%  in  large  towns  and  up  to  30%  in  small  towns. \nHowever,  solid  waste  is  threatening  the  environment  despite  some  improvement  in  waste \ntreatment.  Of  the  country\u2019s  total  of  about  100  dumps  and  landfills,  only  20%  are  of  adequate \nsanitary quality. The rest cause environmental pollution and are a threat to people\u2019s health and \nto  surface  and  groundwater  systems.  Hazardous  waste  incineration  systems  are  lacking  and \nhazardous wastes generated by industry are usually disposed of with other general wastes.  \n\n                                                 \n1  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  Southeast  Asia  Water  Utilities  Network,  United  States\u2013Asia \nEnvironmental  Partnership,  and  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  2005.

Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n4. \nOverall  Sector  Performance.  Despite  considerable  gains  in  indicators  in  the  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sector,  the  coverage  and  quality  of  services  is  not  sufficient  to \nmeet  the  growing  demand.  Shortages  of  piped  water  and  intermittent  services  are  common. \nMechanisms for effective delivery have yet to be fully implemented or are impractical. The key \nproblems that need to be addressed in the short to medium term are (i) inadequate investment \nin the sector whereby only one third of 600 district towns have piped water, only a few large and \nmedium-sized  towns  have  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment  facilities,  and  cities  have  no \nwastewater  treatment  plants;  (ii)  public  operating  entities\u2019  (POEs)  lack  of  autonomy  and \nbusiness  focus  because  of  unsustainable  tariffs;  (iii)  poor  O&M  of  infrastructure  systems  as \nindicated by high unaccounted-for water figures; (iv) lack of management and technical capacity \nof POE and people\u2019s committees; and (v) weak institutional framework and sector regulation. \n \nB. \n\nSector Institutions.  \n\n5. \nThe Ministry of Construction is the line ministry  responsible for providing guidelines for \nsectoral development at the central level. Other related ministries include the ministries of rural \ndevelopment and agriculture (water resources); natural resources and environment (water use, \npollution,  and  hydrology);  and  health  (drinking  water  and  sanitation  quality  and  environmental \nhealth education). The provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) oversees urban WSS operations of \nthe  provincial  department  of  construction.  The  service  providers  include  water  supply  and \ndrainage companies, town or district water supply companies, or urban environment companies, \nwhich  operate  at  district  and  town  levels.  The  setup  for  managing  sewerage,  drainage,  and \nsanitation is sometimes not clear and could be different from town to town. \n\nTable A2: Existing Management of Urban Services in the Project Towns \n\nProvince \n\nCity or Town \n\nClass \n\nPhu Yen  \n\nTuy Hoa \n\nSong Cau \n \nCam Ranh \n\nNinh Hoa \n \n\nCa Na \n \nPhan Thiet \n \nGia Nghia \n\nIII \n\nV \n\nIV \n\nV \n\nIII \n\nV \n\nIII \n\nIV \n\nWater Supply \n\nPhu Yen WSDCa \n\nExisting POE/WSSP \nDrainage/ \nWastewater \nPhu Yen WSDCa \n\nPhu Yen WSDCa \n\nNone \n\nCam Ranh Urban \nWorksb \n\nCam Ranh Urban \nWorksb \n\nNinh Hoa Urban \nCompanyb \n\nNinh Hoa Urban \nCompanyb \n\nNinh Thuan Water \nSupply Co \n\nNone \n\nNinh Thuan Water \nSupply Co \n \nNone \n\nBinh Thuan WSDC \n\nBinh Thuan WSDC \n\nDak Nong \nWSD&UW \n\nDak Nong \nWSD&UW \n \n\nSolid Waste \n\nURENCO under \nCPC \nUnit under TPC \n\nCam Ranh Urban \nWorksb \n/Cooperatives \nNinh Hoa Urban \nCompanyb \n \nWard Cooperatives \n\nNone \n\nUnit under CPC \n \nCooperatives \n\nNinh Thuan  \n\nThap Cham \n\nCPC  =  city  people\u2019s  committee;  POE  =  public  operating  entity;  TPC  =  town  people\u2019s  committee;  WSDC  =  water \nsupply and drainage company; URENCO = Urban Environmental Company; WSD&UW = water supply, drainage, and \nurban works company; WSSP = water supply and sanitation provider. \na   OMLLC = one member limited liability company. \nb  JSC = joint stock company. \nSource: PPTA consultant report. \n \n\nKhanh Hoa  \n\nBinh Thuan  \n\nDak Nong  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\n6. \n \n\nSector Issues and Challenges \n\nThe WSS sector faces four main challenges:  \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\nLack  of  managerial  autonomy  and  accountability  of  POEs. PPC approval is \nrequired  for  most  key  management  and  operating  decisions,  including  service \nlevels, staff salary and benefits, and major expenditures. Excessive dependence \non PPCs decisions limits the capacity of POEs to efficiently deliver services.  \n\nLack  of  capacity  and  human  skills  of  POEs.  Although  sufficient  staff  is \nallocated,  WSS  service  providers  lack  capital,  equipment,  and  training.  Many \nmanagers  are  engineers  and  often  lack  business  and  management  skills, \nresulting  in  poor  attention  to  financial  management,  markets,  and  customers\u2019 \nneeds. \n\nLow  tariffs and  cost  recovery  arising  from  poor  quality  services. While the \nauthority  to  set  tariffs  continues  to  be  held  by  the  PPCs,  the  tariff  guidelines \nissued  in  1999  and  2004  do  not  provide  a  specific  method  for  calculating  the \nrequired level of cost recovery, and lack suitable mechanisms for valuing assets \nand  calculating  depreciation,  constraining  full  cost  recovery  and  eventual  WSS \ncompany equitization. \n\n(iv)  \n\nLack  of  a  sound  regulatory  framework.  Outdated  regulations  and  weak \nenforcement of regulations provide disincentives for efficient service delivery. \n\n \nD. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Reforms \n\nGovernment sector policy and strategy are set out in separate orientation plans for urban \n7. \nwater supply, drainage, and solid waste management, approved by the Prime Minister in 1998 \nand  1999.  The  orientation  plans  provide  sector  targets  and  present  Government  reforms  that \naim to decentralize responsibility for urban WSS services to provincial governments, strengthen \nsector  institutions,  increase  cost  recovery  through  user  charges,  and  gradually  eliminate \ngovernment subsidies. By 2020, all urban areas are expected to be covered and have suitable \ndrainage and wastewater treatment facilities. This will be accompanied by sector and financial \nreform, modernization of technology and human resources, and mobilization of resources from \ncivil society.  \n \n8. \nAdministrative  arrangements  for  urban  WSS  are  gradually  changing  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Unified  Enterprise  Law,  which  aims  to  separate  POEs  from  government \nadministration  by  equitizing  POEs  by  converting  them  gradually  into  shareholding  companies \nwith  49\u2013100%  public  ownership.  Under  the  2005  Enterprise  Law,  all  POEs  will  be  converted \ngradually into limited liability companies or joint stock companies by 2010. POEs that cannot be \nequitized  in  the  short  term  will  first  be  converted  into  one-member  limited  liability  companies, \nwhich  gives  them  greater  autonomy  in  business  decisions,  staff  remuneration,  and  capital \nraising,  allowing  for  gradual  reduction  of  subsidies  from  the  state  budget.  When  the  limited \nliability  become  profitable  and  financially  capable,  they  will  be  gradually  equitized  by  selling \nshares to the public.  \n \nIn sector financing, Government policy aims to (i) adopt full cost-recovery tariffs for water \n9. \nsupply;  (ii)  introduce  drainage  charges,  incorporated  into  water  tariff  structures;  (iii)  apply \ndrainage  and  solid  waste  tariffs  that  are  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  costs;  and  (iv)  gradually \nincrease tariffs to cover capital investment requirements, and reduce the need for government \nsubsidies.  \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\n28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nProject \n\n \nA.

This constrains \nfull cost recovery and eventual \nPOE equitization. \n\nMost POEs have limited \nautonomy and accountability \nas well as capital and \nequipment for their operations, \nand asset management \ncapacities are weak.

Gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) maintained an average annual growth of about 7% and the urban population ratio has increased from 20% in \n1990  to  about  25%  in  2005.  Annual  average  GDP  growth  rate  for  2006\u20132010  is  targeted  at  7.5%\u20138.0%.  The  urban \npopulation in the Central Region totaled close to 4.5 million in 2003 and is growing at 4.7% per annum. Since the last \ndecade,  urban  infrastructure  has  been  unable  to  meet  the  increasing  demands  of  the  growing  urban  population \nbecause of (i) continued rural\u2013urban migration caused by greater farm mechanization in the rural areas and perceived \nhigher incomes in urban growth centers; (ii) insufficient funds to expand urban infrastructure; and (iii) weak institutional \narrangements  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  systems  for  long-term  sustainability.  This  imbalance  heightens \nenvironmental and health risks, and inhibits urban social and economic development in the Central Region. \n \nThe Project aims to alleviate the pressure of rapid urbanization in provincial and medium-sized towns in the Central \nRegion  and  improve  environmental  conditions  for  better  health  and  hygiene.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s master plans for urban development in eight towns in five provinces: (i) Gia Nghia (Dak Nong); (ii) Phan \nTiet (Binh Thuan); (iii) Thap Cham and Ca Na (Ninh Thuan); (iv) Cam Ranh and Ninh Hoa (Khanh Hoa); and (v) Tuy \nHoa  and  Song  Cau  (Phu  Yen).  The  Project  will  help  achieve  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Millennium  Development  Goal  7  on \nenvironmental sustainability. A community environmental improvement program provides awareness information and \nassistance for household and community improvements. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe Central Region is one of the poorest in Viet Nam, accounting for about 38% of the total poor. Living standards are \noften  lower,  with  poverty  levels  higher  than  the  national  average.  Poor  and  near-poor  households  are  the  most \nvulnerable  to  weak  urban  infrastructure  and  unsanitary  conditions.  The  urban  poor  in  the  project  towns  live  in \nunderserved  areas  with  inadequate  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  dysfunctional  or  nonexistent  drainage, \nfrequent  flooding,  and  limited  access  to  solid  waste  collection.  For  instance,  poor  and  low-income  households  are \nfishing  households  along  the  coastal  areas  in  Phu  Yen,  Khanh  Hoa,  and  Ninh  Thuan.  Poor  toilet  and  septic  tank \nfacilities add to unsanitary conditions and environmental pollution. Improving environmental conditions will reduce high \nhealth care expenditures related to waterborne and environmental illness.  \n \nA  poverty  analysis  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation.  Socioeconomic  surveys  of  100  households  in  each \nproject town were conducted. The survey also showed the wide gaps between low- and high-income households. The \nincome per capita of the household head from the highest income stratum is D682,000 or almost seven times more \nthan  that  of  the  lowest  stratum  (D97,000).  A  profile  was  created  for  each  project  town  based  on  these  surveys  and \nsecondary  town  data.  An  affordability  analysis  was  also  done  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  tariffs  under  the \nProject for the poor and vulnerable households.  \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation  to  identify  key  project  stakeholders,  their  project-\nrelated  interests,  and  their  potential  roles  in  project  implementation.  Primary  stakeholders  include  town  residents; \nhouseholds, especially female-headed households, affected by land acquisition and resettlement; Management Board \nfor  Urban  Technical  Infrastructure  Projects  and  MOC;  PPCs;  public  utility  companies;  and  provincial  Viet  Nam \nWomen\u2019s Union (VWU). Secondary stakeholders include relevant line agencies and mass organizations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation strategy has been streamlined into the project design and social safeguard documents to ensure that \ndifferent stakeholders continue to participate during implementation. Consultations with local government officials and \nresidents will be important, especially if the scope of any component changes. Continued discussions and subsequent \ndisclosure  of  social  safeguard  documents  will  also  be  important  to  ensure  affected  people,  especially  vulnerable \ngroups, are aware of proposed mitigation and rehabilitation measures. The involvement of the provincial VWU in the \ncommunity environmental improvement program is critical to the Project\u2019s complementing physical infrastructure with \nawareness  and  community  and  household  programs.  The  following  actions  are  also  important  for  implementing  the \ncommunity component: (i) timely disbursement of funds to the provincial VWU, and (ii) a designated focal point in the \nGovernment and one in the public utility companies to work directly with the provincial VWU.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn  Viet  Nam,  females  are  generally  responsible  for  a  conducting  a  variety  of  tasks  related  to  household  water  and \nsanitation and community environmental improvements. Women are responsible for ensuring sufficient supply of clean \nwater for family consumption (drinking and cooking). However, associated tasks differ for females living in urban and \nrural areas. Unlike in rural areas, distance to the nearest water source is not an issue in urban areas. In urban areas, \nimproved access to safe water supply benefits women in terms of increased cost-savings and time. Improved drainage \n\n Yes  \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n No \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nand enhanced solid  waste collection helps to eliminate standing rain and storm water and unsanitary wastes. Better \naccess  to  water  supply,  improved  drainage,  and  systematic  solid  waste  collection  help  reduce  health  care \nexpenditures for households and improve individuals\u2019 well-being. \n \nImprovements  in  water  supply  and  sanitation-related  services  may  ease  women\u2019s  physical  burden  but  might  also \nincrease their burden in managing scarce resources. Most women are willing to pay for improvements in water supply \nservices but some said they were not, as in Cam Ranh (25%), Ninh Hoa (45%), Phan Tiet (56%), and Tuy Hoa (44%). \nMost are willing to pay from D5,000 to D 8,000. \n \nA  relatively  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women  reside  in  the  project  area  because  of  high  labor \nmigration among males to urban centers to supplement their rural livelihoods. Female heads of households earn lower \nincome per capita per month (D298,000) than male heads (D326,000). Highland towns (e.g., Gia Nghia) have a high \npercentage of ethnic minority groups such as the Ma and Edde, whose women are of slightly higher status than their \ncoastal or lowland counterparts. A gender action plan is in Appendix 11. \nHas an output been prepared? \nE.

In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nOperations  Manual  (OM)  F2,  a  resettlement  plan  for  each \nprovince  has  been  prepared  for  the  subcomponents  that  are \nfully defined. A resettlement framework has been prepared also \nto  guide  in  preparation  during  project  implementation  of \nResettlement  plans  for  complementary  small,  scattered,  or \nnetworked  components  entailing  minor  impacts  that  can  be \nidentified  only  in  connection  with  detailed  engineering  and \ntechnical design.  \nAn affordability analysis was undertaken for the Project. It found \nthat  tariffs  are  affordable  for  most  households  above  the \npoverty  line  (tariffs  are  within  the  targeted  percentage  of  the \naverage  monthly  household  income  of  6.5%).  However,  the \nanalysis  showed  that  households  living  below  the  poverty  line \n(D800,000/household/month) find the tariffs 2% higher than the \nmaximum  affordability  benchmarks.  Specific  actions  and  steps \nwill  help  poor  households  that  cannot  afford  to  pay  connection \nfees (deferred payment schemes, household grants). \nConstruction,  operation  and  maintenance  of  water  supply, \ndrainage, and solid waste systems will create jobs by upgrading \nand  expanding  urban  services.  Job  or  income  losses  are \nexpected because of land acquisition and resettlement. However, \nwage labor in the area is sufficient. Income-generating provisions \nfor  those  losing  land  will  be  required  for  inclusion  in  the \nresettlement  plans. \ntowns  with  a  solid  waste \ncomponent,  waste  pickers  will  (i)  be  employed  by  the  public \nworks  company  or  (ii)  work  at  the  new  landfill  sites.  A  capacity-\nbuilding  program  will  improve  human  resource  development  for \nproject staff, public works employees, and the VWU. \nMost  people  in  the  project  area  are  Kinh.  Ethnic  minorities  are \nfound in Thap Cham (1.2%) and Gia Nghia (35.3%). Urban areas \nhave few ethnic minority households.

The  gender  action  plan  is \nbased on (i) a gender analysis that was conducted during project preparation; (ii) socioeconomic \nsurveys  completed  in  eight  project  towns;  (iii)  consultations  with  women  of  different  ages  and \nethnic  groups,  government  officials,  and  the  Viet  Nam  women\u2019s  unions;  and  (iv)  Asian \nfor  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  urban \nDevelopment  Bank \ndevelopment.  The  gender  action  plan  is  based  on  Viet  Nam  regulations  and  ADB  policy  on \ngender and development.1  \n \nIn  Viet  Nam,  females  are  generally  responsible  for  a  variety  of  tasks  related  to \n2. \nhousehold  water  and  sanitation  and  community  environment  improvements.  They  are  key \nactors  in  collecting,  using,  and  managing  water  in  the  household  and  in  the  community.  Their \naccess, use, and control of water and sanitation are invariably related to their status or position \nin  their  families,  ethnic  groups,  and  communities.  In  turn,  the  status  or  position  of  women  is \nrelated to their access and control of resources such as education, employment, land, and other \nlivelihood assets.  \n \nB. \n\nGender Analysis \n\n1. \n\nGeneral Socioeconomic Information \n\n3. \nHouseholds Headed by Women. A high percentage of households headed by women \nreside  in  the  project  area  because  of  high  labor  migration  among  males  to  urban  centers  to \nsupplement their rural livelihoods. About 25% of households in the project towns are headed by \nfemales,  except  in  Phan  Tiet  (45%),  Tap  Cham  (41%),  and  Ca  Na  (39%).  In  Gia  Nghia,  only \n19%  of  households  are  headed  by  women.  Female  heads  of  households  earn,  on  average, \nlower  income  per  capita  per  month  (D298,000)  than  male  heads  (D326,000)  except  in  Gia \nNghia. Most households belong to the majority Kinh ethnic group. However, in Gia Nghia, about \n9%  of  ethnic  households  come  from  Ma  and  Edde  ethnic  groups,  where  women  hold  slightly \nhigher status positions.  \n \nEducational Attainment and Employment. More women (about 78%) than men (71%) \n4. \nin  these  project  towns  have  some  secondary  education.  Some  project  towns,  however,  have \nhigh percentage of women with lower education, such as Ca Na (92%), Ninh Hoa (89%), and \nNinh  Tuan  (88%).  About  one  third  of  households  depend  on  agriculture  and  fishing  for  their \nlivelihoods.  The  rest  rely  on  employment  in  government,  businesses,  and  the  formal  and \ninformal  labor  market.  Surveys  show  that  a  high  percentage  of  women  are  employed  in  the \nbusiness  and  service  and  domestic  sectors.  Women  are  also  employed  in  solid  waste \nmanagement companies as waste collectors and street sweepers, but few are in management \npositions. \n \n5. \nLand  Ownership.  Most  land  ownership  certificates  are  still  in  the  name  of  the  male \nhead  of  the  household.  In  most  cases,  properties  acquired  after  1999  have  the  names  of  the \nhusband and wife reflected in the certificate. The resettlement compensation package will need \nto ensure that women\u2019s rights to compensation and proper assets transfers are recognized.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRelationship with Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management  \n\nWomen  are  responsible  for  ensuring  sufficient  clean  water  for  family  consumption \n6. \n(drinking and cooking). However, associated tasks differ for urban and rural females. Unlike in \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nrural  areas,  the  distance  to  the  nearest  water  source  is  not  an  issue  in  urban  areas.  In  urban \nareas, improved access to safe water supply benefits women in terms of increased cost savings \nand  time.  Improved  drainage  and  enhanced  solid  waste  collection  helps  to  eliminate  standing \nrain and storm water and unsanitary wastes. Better access to water supply, improved drainage \nand  systematic  solid  waste  collection  help  to  reduce  health  care  expenditures  for  households \nand improve individual well-being. \n \n7. \nWomen,  especially  from  the  low-income  households,  have  a  hard  time  meeting  their \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  needs.  About  96%  of  women  from  Ca  Na  and  50%  of \nwomen  from  Cam  Ranh  purchase  drinking  water  from  vendors.  Most  households  surveyed \nindicated that they obtain water from stand posts, boreholes, open dug wells, rainwater, ponds, \nrivers,  and  open  canals.  Some  women,  especially  in  Ca  Na  and  Cam  Ranh,  also  purchase \nwater for washing, particularly during the dry season. The exception was Phan Tiet, which has a \nhigh percentage of households with indoor connections. \n \n8. \nThe  socioeconomic  survey  shows  that  women  and  men  from  low-income  households \nspend  more  time  (20  minutes  or  more  daily)  collecting  water  than  those  from  higher-income \nhouseholds (16 minutes or less). Higher-income households consume more water and pay an \naverage  of  D34,000  per  month  for  water  compared  with  lower-income  households  (D17,000). \nThe cost of water is particularly high in Ca Na and Cam Ranh. \n \n9. \nWhile  most  women  are  willing  to  pay  for  improvements  in  water  supply  services,  a \nsignificant number were not: Cam Ranh (25%), Ninh Hoa (45%), Phan Tiet (56%), and Tuy Hoa \n(44%).  This  unwillingness  to  pay  could  increase  women\u2019s  burden  of  managing  scarce \nhousehold  resources.  Nevertheless,  an  overwhelming  majority  (95%)  indicated  that  they  were \nwilling to pay D5,000\u2013D7,000 per cubic meter (m3). Some households in Ca Na, Cam Ranh, Gia \nNghia, and Ninh Hoa said they were willing to pay up to D8,000/m3, as water there is expensive, \nespecially in the dry season.  \n \n10.  Most  households  (60%)  from  the  lowest  income  stratum  do  not  have  toilets,  almost \ndouble  those  (37%)  in  the  project  towns.  Women  in  about  two  thirds  of  the  households  are \nresponsible for disposing of human excreta in buckets to farmers and fishpond owners, or into \nthe nearest stream, pond, or canal. Only a third of the households have their trash collected by \na  waste  management  company  while  the  rest  dispose  of  waste  by  other  means  (burning, \nburying,  or  scattering  into  canals,  ponds,  and  rivers).  About  58%  also  dispose  of  wastewater \ninto their garden, empty lots, and open canals. The same proportion of the households do not \nwant to connect waste water pipes to the public drainage system but most are willing to pay a \none-time fee for water connection.  \n \n11.  Most  waste  pickers  at  landfill  sites  are  women.  They  often  work  long  hours  (10\u201312 \nhours)  and  earn  less  than  men.  They  are  exposed  to  pollution  and  unhygienic  conditions  and \npractices, and lack access to proper equipment and tools (e.g., push carts, disposal containers, \nhygienic  masks,  gloves,  boots,  and  facilities  for  washing).  The  income  earned  through  waste \npicking helps to supplement household income in times of scarcity.  \n \n\n3. \n\nParticipation in Community Activities \n\nFewer  than  one  fifth  (16%)  of  women  decide  on  their  own  whether  to  participate  in \n12. \ncommunity  activities.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  community  activities  and  membership  in  mass \norganizations such as the VWU are influenced by income, education attainment, and the ability \nto  make  alternative  arrangements  for  completing  domestic  tasks.  Women  have  a  large \nmembership  base  in  the  VWU  and  are  influential  players  in  decision  making  related  to  WSS \nactivities\u2014both at the community and household levels.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nGender Action Plan  \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n43 \n\nThe gender action plan has been prepared to highlight the project benefits for both men \n13. \nand women and how the Project addresses gender disparities in the WSS sector. The following \nare considered and highlighted as actions in the gender action plan (Table A11): \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nWomen\u2019s  participation  will  be  enhanced  during  the  Project.  Consultations  with \nwomen  of  all  income  and  ethnic  groups  will  take  into  account  differences  in \naccess  to  resource  and  livelihood  bases.  Attention  will  be  paid  to  the  special \nneeds of the poor, ethnic minority women, and members of households headed \nby  females.  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  barriers  to  their  participation  in  related \nactivities  and  decision  making.  Efforts  are  also  included  to  increase  the \nparticipation  and  representation  of  women  in  decision-making  structures  and \nprocesses  in  public  utility  companies  and  the  provincial  project  management \nunits (PPMUs).  \n\nThe Project focuses attention on building government and institutional capacity in \ngender  awareness.  Gender  training  for  project  staff  and  technical  staff  will  help \nincrease awareness and their responsiveness to the different WSS needs of both \nmen and women. \n\nThe  Project  ensures  that  participation  and  consultation strategies  are geared  to \nencourage the involvement of women, ethnic minorities, and poor households in \nresettlement  planning  and  implementation.  The  Project  includes  measures  that \ngive special attention to women in severely affected households (those that are \nphysically  displaced  or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  income-generating \nassets).  Consultations  with  and  assistance  to  severely  affected  women  will  be \norganized in close consultation with local branches of the women\u2019s union.  \n\n \n14. \nImplementation arrangements and estimated costs of the gender action plan have been \nintegrated  into  the  overall  arrangements  and  total  budget  of  the  Project.  Each  PPMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  gender  action  plan.  An  international  community \nenvironmental  sanitation  and  gender  specialist  and  a  community  development  specialist  will \nhelp  conduct  gender  awareness  trainings  for  project  units,  establish  sex-disaggregated \nindicators  for  a  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  and  coordinate  with \nother specialists.  \n \n15. \nResettlement  plans  will  pay  special  attention  to  (i)  the  role  of  women\u2019s  economic \nactivities in restoring living standards; (ii) access to existing credit and agricultural extension for \nwomen,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households;  (iii)  joint  registration  of  land  use  rights  in  the \nnames  of  husband  and  wife,  where  households  are  allocated  alternative  agricultural  and/or \nresidential land; (iv) participation and consultation strategies that encourage the involvement of \nwomen, ethnic minorities, and poor households in resettlement planning and implementation; (v) \nattention to complaints and grievances by women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; and \n(vi) data disaggregated by sex and ethnicity to support resettlement planning and monitoring.  \n \n16. \nThe  PPMU  will  include  information  on  the  progress  of  gender  action  plan  activities  in \nquarterly  progress  reports  prepared  and  submitted  to  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  for \nconsolidation.  The  PCU  will  consolidate  the  information  and  ensure  that  an  update  on  the \ngender action plan is provided to ADB in its semiannual progress reports. The midterm review \nwill review updates and make adjustments. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nProject \nComponent \n\nPart A: Water Supply Development \n \n\n\u2022 \n\nTable A11: Gender Action Plan \n\nActions Proposed \n\nIssues of affordability and access for male and female-headed households will be considered \nand addressed (e.g., water supply system tariffs). \n\n\u2022  Households  headed  by  females  are  eligible  for  equal  compensation,  additional  support \nmeasures  for  rehabilitation,  and  asset  transfers  that  help  retain  the  higher  status  of  ethnic \nwomen from Ma and Edde groups. \n\nPart B: Drainage and Wastewater Management \n \n\n\u2022  Men and women will provide inputs on subcomponents before finalizing the details of larger \n\nsubcomponents (e.g., open drains vs. covered ones). \n\n\u2022  Households  headed  by  females  are  eligible  for  equal  compensation,  additional  support \nmeasures  for  rehabilitation,  and  asset  transfers  that  help  retain  the  higher  status  of  ethnic \nwomen from the Ma and Edde. \n\nPart C: Solid Waste Management \n \n\n\u2022  Both male and female waste pickers will have the option of (i) being employed by the public \n\nworks company or (ii) continuing to work at the new landfill sites. \n\n\u2022  Households  headed  by  females  are  eligible  for  equal  compensation,  additional  support \nmeasures for rehabilitation, and asset transfers that help retain the higher status of women \nfrom the Ma and Edde. \n\nPart D: Community Environmental Sanitation and Awareness \nD.1.

The RPs cover project components \nsufficiently designed to conduct the basic resettlement planning activities of census, inventory of \nlosses, and a socioeconomic survey. \n \n2. \nEach  provincial  Project  has  subcomponents  as  yet  not  designed,  so  resettlement \nplanning cannot be undertaken. For components for which assessments were able to be made, \nthe  results  were  incorporated  in  the  RP.  For  those  which  could  not  be  assessed  during  the \nproject  preparation  stage,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  in  their \nresettlement planning and implementation after detailed design.  \n \n3. \nThe RF and RPs were prepared for all 13 candidate project towns, which were selected \nfrom  18  towns.  Because  the  budget  was  limited,  however,  the  Project  will  cover  only  eight \ntowns:  Phan  Thiet,  Gia  Ngia,  Cam  Ranh,  Ninh  Hoa,  Thap  Cham,  Cana,  Phu  Yen,  and  Song \nCau. \n \n4. \nThe  RF  and  RPs  have  been  built  upon  the  laws  of  the  Government,  principally  the \nrevised  2003  Land  Law,  Decree  197  (2004),  and  Decree  17  (2006),  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement,1 Operations Manual (OM) F2, and the public communications policy.2. \nProvisions and principles adopted in the RF and RPs will supersede the provisions of relevant \ndecrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists,  as  per  Decree  17/2001/ND-CP \n(2001). \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAbout  59  ha  will  be  lost  because  of  improvements  in  drainage,  flood  protection, \nwastewater, sanitation, and solid waste infrastructure for the main project components described \nin the five RPs. For these main components, 154 households will be severely affected either by \ndisplacement of housing or loss of more than 10% of productive land, and 48 households will be \nmarginally  affected,  for  a  total  of  202  households  (894  people).  Involuntary  resettlement  effects \nwill  be  most  severe  in  or  near  landfill  areas,  wastewater  treatment  plants,  and  wastewater \nstabilization ponds.  \n \n6. \nTable  A12  summarizes  the  known  impacts  and  their  estimated  resettlement  costs.  The \nremaining  subcomponents  are  expected  to  cause  minimal  impacts,  but  this  is  to  be  confirmed \nafter detailed design, when priority will be given to avoiding or minimizing impacts. \n \n7. \nPart  D  (community  environmental  sanitation  and  awareness)  may  require  only  minor \nland  acquisition,  if  any,  for  building  drains,  footpaths,  and  solid  waste  collection  units. \nCommunity  proposals  will  be  evaluated  at  the  time  of  submission.  The  RF  will  guide  any \nunforeseen land acquisition and resettlement planning during the Project. RPs for each project \ntown will be prepared or revised for the ADB approval as needed. \n \n \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995.

Those without legal title to land \nand/or structures occupied or used by them (e.g., non-titled affected people) will \nbe entitled to various options of resettlement assistance, provided they cultivated \nor  otherwise  occupied  the  land  before  the  eligibility  cut-off  date.  Resettlement \nassistance to non-titled affected people will include compensation for lost assets \nand restoration of income and living standards.  \nIn cases where relocation or displacement is required, all possible efforts will be \nmade  to  maintain  the  social  and  cultural  institutions  of  the  resettled  people  and \nthe host community.  \nRPs  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  with  participation  and  consultation  of \naffected  people.  The  comments  and  suggestions  of  affected  people  and \ncommunities will be taken into account during the design and implementation of \nresettlement activities. \nADB  will  not  approve  any  civil  works  contract  for  any  subcomponent  to  be \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds  unless  the  Government  has  satisfactorily \ncompleted  payment  of  compensation  for  affected  assets  and  any  relocation  to \nnew  sites,  in  accordance  with  the  approved  RP  for  the  subcomponent. \nRehabilitation measures must also be in place but not necessarily completed, as \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nthese may be ongoing activities. Vulnerable households (households headed by \nfemales  with  dependents,  disabled  household  heads,  poor  households,  the \nlandless,  the  elderly  with  no  means  of  support,  households  without  security  of \ntenure, and ethnic minorities) will be compensated with respect for their cultural \nvalues  and  specific  needs.  Assistance  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  will  include \nmeasures to help them improve their socioeconomic status. \nAffected people who lose only part of their physical assets will not be left with a \nportion  that  will  be  inadequate  to  sustain  their  current  standard  of  living.  The \nminimum  size  of  remaining  land  and  structures  will  be  agreed  during  the \nresettlement planning in consultation with affected people. \n\n(vii) \n\n(x) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  As a priority, loss of agricultural land will be compensated with alternative land of \nequal size and productive capacity. If suitable replacement land is not available, \nat the \u201cinformed request\u201d of affected people, compensation will be paid in cash at \nreplacement  value  based  on  current  market  prices  for  agricultural  land  of  the \nsame category (productive capacity) as the affected land. \nReplacement  land  for  agriculture,  residential  purposes  and  businesses  will  be \nprovided  with  secure  tenure  status;  all  fees,  sales  taxes,  or  other  surcharges \nassociated with transfer of land title will be waived. \nCompensation  for  houses  and  other  structures  will  be  determined  according  to \nreplacement value for materials and labor to rebuild similar structures, at current \nmarket  prices  in  the  locality.  In  determining  replacement  costs,  depreciation  of \nassets and salvage value of materials will not be taken into account. \nIn  case  of  the  relocation  of  affected  people,  replacement  houses  and/or \nagricultural land will be located as close as possible to the assets that were lost, \nand  at  locations  acceptable  to  affected  people.  Relocated  affected  people  will \nreceive relocation and transition subsistence allowances. \nAdequate  resources  will  be  identified  and  committed  during  resettlement \nplanning for each subcomponent and the overall Project. This includes adequate \nbudgetary support fully committed for each subcomponent and made available to \nresettlement,  and \ncover \nrehabilitation within the agreed implementation period for the subcomponent; and \nadequate  human  resources  for  supervision,  liaison  and  monitoring  of  land \nacquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation activities. \n\nland  acquisition,  compensation, \n\nthe  costs  of \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xiii)  Reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified  and  set  in \nplace as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and evaluation \nof  the  land  acquisition,  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  processes,  and  the  final \noutcomes will be conducted by an independent monitoring agency. \n\n(xiv)  RPs will be translated into Vietnamese, or where necessary, the local language, \nand  placed  in  commune  offices  for  the  reference  of  affected  people  as  well  as \nother interested groups. \n\n \nThe  project  entitlements  are  designed  to  cover  compensation,  resettlement,  and \n9. \nrehabilitation for lost assets and incomes and restore or enhance the livelihoods of all affected \npeople. Affected people will not only receive compensation in cash or in kind (e.g., replacement \nland  or  materials)  at  replacement  cost  for  affected  assets  and  income  losses,  but  various \nrehabilitation measures will also be provided to help them restore their livelihoods and income \nlevels.  Special  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  vulnerable  affected  people  to  help  them \nimprove their socioeconomic status.  \n \nD. \n\nConsultation, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure \n\n10. \nPeople  potentially  affected  by  the  main  subcomponents  have  been  informed  about  the \nproject scope and impacts and that they are eligible for compensation and assistance. A specific \npublic consultation and disclosure plan has been prepared for each RP and entails consultation \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nto  be  undertaken  during  detailed  resettlement  planning  and \n\nand  disclosure  activities \nimplementation. \n \n11. \nThe RF and RPs will be translated into Vietnamese. Copies of the RF and RPs, in both \nEnglish  and  Vietnamese,  will  be  distributed  to  the  provinces.  The  public  information  booklets \nprepared for the five provinces have been translated into Vietnamese and will be distributed to \nall affected people before loan appraisal, while copies of the RPs will be placed in the respective \ndistrict and commune offices. The draft RF and RPs submitted to ADB for review and approval \nwill  be  uploaded  on  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  website  before  loan  appraisal;  the  final  RPs  and  RF \nagreed by Government and ADB will also be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The updated and new \nsubcomponent RPs prepared after detailed design will also be disclosed to affected people and \nuploaded on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n12. \nA well-defined grievance redress and resolution mechanism will be established consistent \nwith  the  legal  process  for  resolution  of  disputes  in  Viet  Nam.  However,  since  the  system  is \noriented  primarily  toward  disputes  between  people,  as  opposed  to  between  people  and  the \ngovernment, it will be strengthened. Provincial resettlement committees will record all grievances \nand  complaints  as  well  as  their  final  resolution.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \nresponsible  for  checking  the  procedures  for  and  resolutions  of  grievances  and  complaints,  and \nmay recommend further measures to be taken to redress unresolved grievances. \n \n13. \nAll affected people will be made fully aware of their rights and the detailed procedures for \nfiling  grievances  through  the  public  information  booklet.  All  affected  people  who  present \ncomplaints will be exempt from all administrative fees incurred and will be provided with free legal \nrepresentation should they lodge appeals to the courts.  \n \nE. \n\nGender and Ethnicity Issues \n\n14. \nHighland towns such as Gia Nghia have a high percentage of ethnic households, where \nwomen  come  from  ethnic  minority  groups  such  as  the  Ma  and  Edde  and  hold  slightly  higher \nstatus  positions  than  their  coastal  or  lowland  counterparts.  Four  affected  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds  were  found  in  Gia  Nghia  but  none  in  the  other  areas  for  which  RPs  have  been \nprepared.  Specific  actions  have  been  integrated  into  the  project  design  to  ensure  that  ethnic \nminorities  have  equal  access  to  project  benefits,  have  culturally  appropriate  awareness  and \neducation materials, and are safeguarded against adverse impacts. In RPs and the RF, ethnic \nminorities  are  entitled  to  equal  compensation,  resettlement,  and  allowances,  and  additional \nsupport measures to help them improve their socioeconomic status, and help retain the higher \nstatus of women from the Ma and Edde. \n \nRP preparation and implementation will pay special attention to the following issues: (i) \n15. \nrole  of  women\u2019s  economic  activities  in  restoring  living  standards;  (ii)  access  to  existing  credit \nand  agricultural  extension  for  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households;  (iii)  joint \nregistration of land use rights in the names of husband and wife in instances where households \nare  allocated  alternative  agricultural  and/or  residential  land;  (iv)  participation  and  consultation \nstrategies that encourage the involvement of women, ethnic minorities, and poor households in \nresettlement planning and implementation; (v) attention to complaints and grievances lodged by \nwomen,  ethnic  minorities,  and  poor  households;  and  (vi)  disaggregated  data  collection  on \ngender and ethnic minorities to support resettlement planning and monitoring. Special attention \nwill  be  given  to  women  in  severely  affected  households  (households  that  are  physically \ndisplaced  or  who  will  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  income-generating  assets). \nConsultations  with  and  assistance  to  severely  affected  women  will  be  organized  in  close \nconsultation  with  local  branches  of  the  Women\u2019s  Union.  A  project-specific  gender  action  plan \nhas been developed and is included as Appendix 11. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule \n\nincluding \n\nimplementation  activities, \n\nEach provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) will be the executing agency for its respective \n16. \nproject component and will have overall responsibility for it. Each PPC will establish a provincial \nresettlement committee with overall responsibility for approval and implementation of the project \nRPs,  approving  resettlement  budgets,  and  issuing  decisions  on  land  acquisition.  A  provincial \nproject management unit (PPMU) will be established in each province to manage and monitor \nall  day-to-day  project \nresettlement  planning  and \nimplementation.  PPMU  functions  will  include  preparation  and  implementation  of  new  and \nupdated RPs, establishing and maintaining an affected person database for internal monitoring \nand making this available to the independent monitoring agency, and integrating civil works with \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  PPMU  will  establish  a  resettlement  working \ngroup (RWG) staffed mainly by members of the Land Administration Department to undertake \nthe resettlement-related functions of the PPMU. The RWG will coordinate implementation of the \nconsultation program and income restoration measures with the mass organizations, including \nthe women\u2019s union, NGOs, and other community organizations and government departments. \n \n17. \nProject consultant resettlement specialists will provide technical expertise to the project \ncoordination unit (PCU) established under Management Board for Urban Technical Infrastructure \nProjects. One international consultant with periodic input and a one full-time national consultant \nwill  help  PPMUs  prepare  new  and  updated  RPs  and  detailed  resettlement  planning, \nimplementation,  and  internal  monitoring  and  reporting  procedures,  and  will  provide  formal  and \non-the-job training in all aspects of resettlement planning and implementation. \n \n18. \nThe  overall  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  starting  in  2007.  Resettlement \nactivities  will  commence  only  after  the  project  supervision  consultants  and  the  independent \nmonitoring agency have mobilized. ADB will not approve award of a civil works contract for any \nsubproject  or  subcomponent  unless  the  PPMU  has  (i)  satisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance \nwith  the  approved  relevant  RP  for  that  Project  or  subcomponent,  compensation  payment  and \nrelocation  to  new  sites;  and  (ii)  ensured  that  the  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place  and  the \narea required for civil works is free of all encumbrances.  \n \nG. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n19. \nRP  implementation  will  be  regularly  monitored  by  the  PPMUs  and  RWGs.  Quarterly \nmonitoring reports will be submitted to ADB. An independent monitoring agency will be engaged \nby the PCU to conduct external monitoring and evaluation, focusing on the social impacts of the \nProject  and  whether  affected  people  are  able  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project \nliving standards, incomes, and productive capacity. Two monitoring activities will be undertaken \neach year until all resettlement activities have been completed. A post-resettlement evaluation \nwill also be conducted. Independent monitoring reports will be submitted to the EA and to ADB.  \n \nH. \n\nResettlement Budget and Flow of Funds \n\n20. \nThe  Project\u2019s  estimated  resettlement  cost  is  around  $2.11  million.  Adequate  budgetary \nsupport will be committed and made available to cover all resettlement-related costs within the \nagreed  implementation  period.  The  funds  will  come  from  the  loan.  Each  PPMU  will  be \nresponsible for channeling funds to compensate land acquisition and resettlement to the RWGs. \nThe PPMUs and RWGs will be responsible for payment directly to affected people with respect \nto  land,  crops,  trees,  houses,  other  structures  and  any  allowances,  and  for  delivery  of \nrehabilitation measures.  \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThis summary initial environment examination (IEE) aims to briefly describe the Project\u2019s \npotential  adverse  impacts,  proposed  mitigation  measures,  and  environmental  management \nplans.  It  is  based  on  preliminary  environmental  examinations  undertaken  during  project \npreparation to (i) identify the environmental impacts of project components and (ii) recommend \nmeasures  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  and  enhance  positive  impacts  arising  from  its \nimplementation. \n \n2. \nThe Project is classified under category B, according to ADB\u2019s Policy and Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). The IEEs were prepared following ADB\u2019s environmental policy,1 \nOperations  Manual,  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  and  the  relevant  Government \nof  Viet  Nam  environmental  policies  and  guidelines,  specifically  Circular  490/1998-BICHCNMT \n(29  April  1998),  Guiding  the  Making  and  Evaluation  of  Reports  on  the  Assessment  of \nEnvironmental Impacts of Investment Projects. The IEEs will be approved by the Department of \nNatural Resources and Environment (DONRE) or provincial people\u2019s committees. \n \nB. \n\nProject Description  \n\n3. \nThe Central Region is among the least developed areas of Viet Nam and home to many \nethnic minority groups, especially in the highland areas. Many of the urban areas in this region \nsuffer  from  water  shortages  in  the  dry  season;  the  wet  season  floods  have  adverse \nenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts. The Project will develop, expand or improve water \nsupply,  drainage,  wastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  management  systems  in  eight \ntowns in the provinces of Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan, and Dak Nong. The \nProject has five main components: (i) part A: water supply development and expansion; (ii) part \nB:  drainage  and  wastewater  management;  (iii)  part  C:  solid  waste  management;  (iv)  part  D: \ncommunity  environmental  sanitation  and  awareness;  and  (v)  part  E:  project  management  and \ninstitutional strengthening. The Project will be implemented over 5 years commencing from the \nfirst  half  of  2007.  Detailed  engineering  designs  are  targeted  for  completion  by  mid-2008. \nProjects are scheduled for completion in 2010\u20132011.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n\n4. \nClimate.  Binh  Thuan,  Khanh  Hoa,  Ninh  Thuan,  and  Phu  Yen  are  coastal  provinces  in \nthe  southern  Central  Region,  in  the  monsoon  tropical  zone,  affected  by  sea  climate,  with  3\u20134 \nmonths  of  rainy  season  from  September  to  December  that  accounts  for  75\u201380%  of  the  total \nannual rainfall. Dak Nong is a high mountain province in the highland Central Region, affected \nby  temperate  climate.  It  experiences  3  months  of  rainy  season  from  August  to  October, \naccounting for 76% of the total annual rainfall.  \n \nAir Quality and Noise. Based on available data, dust concentration in project towns, as \n5. \nof 2004, ranged from 0.40 (Gia Nghia) to 0.58 mg/m3 (Cam Ranh), exceeding at least 1.3 times, \nat most twice, the Viet Nam (VN) standard. Concentration of CO, SO2, NO2 in Project cities/town \nwere  within  VN  standard.  Noise  levels  ranged  from  60  (Phan  Thiet)  to  80  dBA  (Thap  Cham). \nOnly two of the six towns with data met the VN standard.  \n \n6. \nTopography and Soils. There are seven main soil groups in the provinces of Phu Yen, \nKhanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Thuan. Sandy soil is found in the coastal plains; alluvial soil \nin  downstream  areas  of  rivers;  grey  soil  in  semi-dough  mound  areas;  yellow-red  soil  in \nhill/mountain areas with high slopes; yellow-red humus soil in mountains of elevation 900\u20131,000 \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nm; valley soil in river valleys; and gravely-eroded soil in slope terrain. Dak Nong has three main \nsoil  groups.  Grey  soil  and  soil  that  is  formed  by  weathered  basalt  stone  largely  make  up  the \nProvince. Alluvial soil is concentrated in areas near rivers.  \n \n7. \nSurface Water. In Phu Yen, two rivers traverse the project towns of Song Cau and Tuy \nHoa. Cau river, a small river in the north, has a catchment area of 146 km2, length of 28 km, and \nan annual average discharge of 4.1 m3/s. Da Rang river, located downstream, drains Tuy Hoa \ntown.  In  Khanh  Hoa,  the  two  main  rivers  are  Cai  Nha  Trang,  which  has  an  annual  average \ndischarge  flow  of  55.7  m3/s,  and  a  dry  monthly  average  discharge  of 7.32  m3/s,  and  Cai  Ninh \nHoa, which has an annual average discharge of 23.9 m3/s and a dry monthly average discharge \nis 0.6 m3/s. In Ninh Thuan the Cai Phan Rang river has a catchment area of 1,929 km2 and a \ntotal length of 246 km. Hydraulic works, e.g., weirs and dams, have been constructed to supply \nwater for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. In Binh Thuan, the Ca Ty river discharges \ndirectly to the sea and is affected by the rise and fall of the tides. It has a catchment area of 820 \nkm2, length of 65 km, annual average discharge of 10.9 m3/s, and peak flood discharge at 5% \nprobability  of  1,030  m3/s.  The  Cai  Phan  Thiet  river  has  a  catchment  area  of  1,050  km2  and \nlength  of  87  km.  In  Dak  Nong  two  main  river  systems,  the  Serepok  and  Dong  Nai,  have  high \nhydropower potentials. The Dak Tik river, a tributary of Da Dang\u2013Dong Nai river system, runs \nthrough Gia Nghia. \n \n8. \nWater quality analyses done by Pasteur Institute in October 2005 show that, in general, \nexcluding TSS and bacteria counts, water quality of rivers and streams that run through project \ntown  still  meet  surface  water  class-A  standards  for  domestic  water  supply.  Meanwhile,  water \nbodies  that  will  be  receiving  effluents  from  wastewater  stabilization  ponds  have  coliform \nconcentrations exceeding VN standards by 140-1,100,000 times. Those in Tuy Hoa and Phan \nThiet have high levels of TSS. \n \n9. \nGroundwater.  Groundwater  potentials  in  Ninh  Thuan,  Bunh  Thuan  and  Dak  Nong \nProvinces are not abundant compared with Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa. Total potential exploitation \nvolume in Phu Yen is 1,210,000 m3/day, but Ninh Thuan is only 205,640 m3/day, Dak Nong is \n260,000  m3/day.  Groundwater  quality  in  Binh  Thuan  and  Phu  Yen  Provinces  is  still  good.  In \nCam Ranh Town of Khanh Hoa, groundwater is polluted by NO3, SO4. In Ninh Thuan and Dak \nNong Provinces, groundwater has high levels of coliform counts. \n  \nD. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nIssues and Concerns Relative to Siting and Design \n\nThe proposed sites and design of subcomponents are confronted with minimal degree of \n10. \nenvironmental  issues  and  concerns.  There  are  national  parks  and  protected  areas  within  the \nproject provinces. However, they are quite far (20\u201350 km) from the project towns and significant \nadverse impacts on biodiversity in those protected areas will not be expected.  \n \n11.  Water  Supply. Raw water sources for Gia Nghia, Can Na and Ninh Hoa towns will be \nsupplied from Dak Tik River,2 Dinh River and Ban Da Lake respectively. The IEEs and the site \nvisits  confirm  adequate  capacity  of  the  water sources.  The  catchment areas  for  the  raw  water \nsources  are  predominantly  shrub,  crop  and  some  secondary  forests.  No  adverse  industrial  or \nagricultural  runoff  to  surface  water  is  expected.  While  specific  mitigation  measures  to  protect \nraw  water  sources  are not  needed at  this  stage,  need  for specific  protection  measures  will  be \nreviewed  during  implementation.  The  proposed  raw  water  treatment  process\u2014coagulation, \n\n                                                 \n2   The Dak Nong hydroelectric scheme is under construction and is expected to complete construction by 2010. If the \nreservoir for the multipurpose dam is not completed by the commencement of the Gia Nghia water supply system, \nthe  existing  partly  constructed  water  treatment  plant  will  be  completed  and  the  Dak  Tik  river  in  Nghia  Binh \ncommune will be used as a raw water source.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nmixing,  sedimentation,  filtration,  and  chlorination\u2014will  ensure  compliance  with  the  national \ndrinking water quality standards, and that sludge from the water treatment process will also be \ntreated in a sludge lagoon or settling basin before discharge into the receiving rivers. \n \n12. \nDrainage  and  Wastewater  Management.  Main  environmental  concerns  are  odor  and \npollution of water bodies from the  wastewater stabilization ponds. Given the projected level of \neconomic development, waste stabilization ponds were chosen as the best method of treatment \nto  achieve  the  required  effluent  standards.3 The  inlet  works  will  be  covered  with  removable \ncovers to minimize odors. Sludge accumulation in the ponds is expected to be slow. After 3\u20136 \nyears, sludge will be covered and retained on site at the treatment facility for 6\u201312 months until \nall pathogens have been destroyed. After testing, final disposal may be on agricultural land as \nfertilizer  or  at  the  landfill.  The  targeted  towns  for  this  component  have  existing  or  proposed \nlandfills within a reasonable distance.  \n \n13. \nSolid  Waste  Management. The proposed sanitary landfill is small in scale (60 ton/day \nfor  Gia  Nghia  and  100/day  for  Cam  Ranh).  Hospitals  and  clinics  are  required  to  have  on-site \ntreatment  facilities.  Interviews  and  site  visits  to  the  existing  dumpsites  confirm  a  low  risk  of \nmixed  disposal  of  solid  and  medical  wastes.  Leachate  will  be  collected  and  treated  in  a \nbiological pond with provision for pumped recirculation. Septic tank sludge will be dewatered in \nseparate ponds located at the landfills and the sludge will be disposed to the landfill. The waste \ncells, leachate and septage ponds will be lined with a compacted clay layer and base cells and \nponds will be at least 1 m above the wet season water table. Because of low groundwater level \nin the proposed site and the proposed measures, potential risk of groundwater contamination is \nlow.  There  are  no  residential  areas  within  1  km.  A  fenced  landfill  with  a  25  m  buffer  zone  will \nprevent unauthorized access and minimize odor.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Impacts \n\nDuring  Construction.  Potential  environmental \n\n14. \nimpacts  during  construction  are \ngeneration  of  dust  and  noise,  soil  erosion  caused  by  excavation,  surface  and  groundwater \ncontamination  by  spoil,  oil  and  grease,  and  wastes.  Those  impacts  are  short  term  and  will  be \nminimized by proposed mitigation measures and good engineering and construction practices. \nPPMU  and  other  relevant  authorities  will  monitor  and  supervise  the  construction  activities \nincluding replanting of trees, working safety, sanitation, and health care of workers.  \n \n15. \nDuring  Operation.  Existing  O&M  manual  and  emergency  and  inspection  plans  will  be \nreviewed  and  revised  as  needed  to  improve  the  operation  performance  to  ensure  delivery  of \nsafe  drinking  water  and  minimize  potential  risk  overflow  and  flooding  of  raw  sewage.  Surface \nand  groundwater  water  quality  testing  will  be  conducted  regularly  to  ensure  compliance  with \ndrinking  water  quality  and  wastewater  standards,  and  to  detect  any  sign  of  groundwater \ncontamination  caused  by  leachate.  Proposed  landfill  sites  for  Gia  Nghia  and  Cam  Ranh  have \nadequate areas to ensure availability of sufficient soil cover. Periodic monitoring and inspection \nwill  be  conducted  to  maintain  daily  soil  cover  after  disposal  of  wastes.  Waste  pickers  will  be \nemployed to recover recyclable wastes at the separation area adjacent to the landfill site and to \nprovide income-generating opportunities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n16. \nThe  Project  will  bring  about  the  following  benefits  that  far  outweigh  all  aforementioned \nadverse  impacts:  (i)  enhanced  environmental  sanitation  and  public  health  (particularly  reduced \nincidence  of  water-related  and  waterborne  diseases);  (ii)  reduced  incidence  of  flooding;  and  (iii) \ninduced  socioeconomic  growth,  which  is  expected  to  pressure  local  authorities  to  meet  rising \n                                                 \n3   The key parameters for discharge to river are BOD 50 mg/L and 10,000 FC/10mL in accordance with TCVN 5945: \n\n1995. Industrial Wastewater Discharge Standards. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\ndemand  for  basic  infrastructure  services.  Part  A  (community  environmental  sanitation  and \nawareness)  will  complement  the  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan  by  increasing \nawareness  of  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  practices  and  by  implementing  community-level \nenvironmental  improvement  activities,  which  will  contribute  to  the  overall  sustainability  of  the \nimproved water supply and environment sanitation in the project towns.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n17. \nThe PPC in each of the five provinces will be the executing agency and will be primarily \nresponsible  for  allocating  the  required  counterpart  funding  and  providing  policy  directions \nthrough the provincial steering committee (PSC), which will be chaired by the provincial people\u2019s \ncommittee (PPC) vice chair and be represented by the members of Department of Construction \n(DOC), Department of Planning and Investment (DPI), Department of Finance (DOF), DONRE, \nViet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  and  other  relevant  institutions  recommended  by  the  PPC. \nThe project steering committee (PSC) will report to the PPC. \n \n18. \nA  PPMU  will  be  established  in  each  province  to  manage  and  monitor  day-to-day \nimplementation  activities,  and  comprise  representatives  of  provincial  water  supply  company, \nurban  environmental  company,  VWU,  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  and  other  relevant \ninstitutions.  An  environmental  management  unit  (EMU)  will  be  set  up  within  the  PPMU  to  be \nresponsible for implementation of environmental mitigation measures and monitoring. The EMU \nwill be headed by a full-time technical staff member and one administrative staff member.  \n\n \n19. \nThe  Project  will  collaborate  with  the  Pasteur  Institute,  Department  of  Science  and \nTechnology,  and  DOH  and  to  test  water  quality.  Environmental  monitoring  results  will  be \ndocumented  to  ensure  that  signs  of  adverse  impacts  are  detected  at  the  earliest  possible  time. \nMonitoring  results  before  and  during  construction  will  be  reported  monthly  by  the  designated \nenvironment specialist in each PPMU. An annual monitoring report will be prepared by the EMU \nand submitted to the PPMU head, who will in turn submit to DONRE for endorsement to the PPC, \nwhich will submit annual reports to ADB.  \n \n20. \nAbout  0.6%  of  the  total  project  costs  will  be  allocated  for  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring. An international environmental monitoring and resettlement specialist \nand  national  environment  monitoring  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  ensure  (i)  update  of \nenvironmental monitoring plan based on detail design, (ii) provision of adequate environmental \nrequirements in the bidding documents and contracts, (iii) conduct of environmental monitoring, \nand (iv) preparation of environmental monitoring reports.  \n  \nF.  Conclusion and Recommendation  \n\n21. \nThe  preliminary  environmental  assessment  indicates  that  the  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  of  the  Project,  as  a  whole,  will  be  minor.  Mitigation  measures  can  be  undertaken \nwithout  difficulty  through  proper  engineering  design,  incorporation  of  recommended  mitigation \nmeasures,  and  community  participation.  The  adverse  impacts  will  be  greatly  offset  by \nimprovements in health, sanitation, and environmental conditions for the urban residents of the \neight project towns.  \n \nThe preliminary environmental assessment confirmed that the Project is under category \n22. \nB according to ADB\u2019s guidelines. No further study or detailed environmental impact assessment \nneeds to be undertaken.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe economic analysis has been undertaken in accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,  Handbook  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects,  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of \nUrban  Development  Sector  Projects,  Handbook  for  Integrating  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  in \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.  \n \n2. \nThe  estimated  costs  and  benefits  of  major  subprojects  were  valued  at  their  economic \nprices using the domestic price numeraire, which adjusts border price equivalent values to their \nequivalent  domestic  prices  and  entails  the  application  of  shadow  price  adjustments  to  convert \nthe estimated financial costs to their equivalent. The shadow price adjustment factors used were \n(i)  foreign  costs,  1.10;  (ii)  unskilled labor,  0.60;  (iii)  skilled  labor,  2.00;  and  (iv)  local  materials, \n1.00.  Capital  and  recurrent  costs,  inclusive  of  physical  contingencies,  in  constant  2006  prices \nwere  converted  into  economic  costs  by  subtracting  all  transfer  payments,  including  taxes  and \nduties, and applying the appropriate shadow price adjustment factors. \n \n3. \nThe  economic  valuation  of  the  water  supply  and  drainage  project  components  were \nbased on the capital and O&M costs of the least-cost alternative as indicated by the calculated \naverage  incremental  costs.  Small  project  components  scattered  throughout  the  participating \nproject  towns  such  as  solid  waste  management  and  community  environmental  sanitation  and \nawareness were examined using the cost-effectiveness criteria.  \n \nB. \n\nBenefits \n\n4. \nWater Supply Development and Expansion. The capacity of the existing water supply \nsystems in Ninh Hoa and Gia Nghia will be expanded from a combined 3,000 m3/day to 17,500 \nm3/day in response to the projected additional demand in these towns as a result of accelerated \neconomic growth by 2015. A new water supply system with a capacity of 2,000 m3/day will be \ndeveloped in Ca Na. A total of about 98 km of new transmission and distribution pipes will be \ninstalled  and  an  estimated  18,000  new  connections  will  be  added.  More  than  6,800  ha  of \nservice area will be involved with about 13,200 households benefiting from the proposed works. \nThe  major  benefits  quantified  include  (i)  resource  cost  savings  on  the  non-incremental  water \nconsumed due to the switch from alternative sources such as tube wells, surface wells, rivers, \nwater  vendors  or  even  households  with  piped  supply  to  the  new  water  supply;  and  (ii)  the \nhousehold\u2019s valuation or willingness to pay for incremental water supply. Non-quantified benefits \ninclude (i) increase the security of uninterrupted access to improved drinking water quality, (ii) \nreduced the risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens in delivered tap water, (iii) improve water \ndistribution efficiency, and (iv) reduce losses from nonrevenue water. \n \nDrainage and Wastewater Management. The Project will develop complete, integrated \n5. \nstormwater drainage, wastewater collection and wastewater treatment systems in the five cities \nor towns of Song Cau, Tuy Hoa, Gia Nghia, Cam Ranh, Thap Cham, and Phan Thiet. Drainage \nand  wastewater  works  constitute  approximately  40%  of  the  estimated  project  cost.  More  than \n23,000  ha  of  service  area  will  be  involved.  About  105,000  households  in  the  40  wards \ncomprising  nine  project  towns  will  benefit  from  the  proposed  works.  The  drainage  and \nwastewater management subcomponents in each town will significantly improve the residents\u2019 \neconomic  welfare.  Anticipated  economic  benefits  were  quantified  by  estimating  (i)  the  health \nbenefits accruing to the residents, (ii) savings resulting from reduced flood damage and losses, \nand (iii) annualized incremental increase in the values of affected land. Health benefits results \nfrom the residents\u2019 improved personal hygiene, public health, and environmental conditions, and \nreduced  medical  expenses  associated  with  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  These \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nhealth  benefits  are  particularly  critical  for  infants,  women,  and  the  elderly  who  spend  most  of \ntheir  time  at  home.  Valuation  of  these  health  benefits  was  based  on  discussions  with \nrepresentatives from each town and the results of the socioeconomic surveys.  \n \n6. \nThe  capacity  of  the  existing  water  supply  systems  in  Ninh  Hoa  and  Gia  Nghia  will  be \nexpanded  from  a  combined  3,000  m3/day  to  17,500m3/day  in  response  to  the  projected \nadditional demand in these towns as a result of accelerated economic growth by 2015. A new \nwater supply system with a capacity of 2,000 m3/day will be developed in Ca Na (Table A14.1).  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Water Supply and Demand Analysis in Project Towns \n\nTown \n\nNinh Hoa \nCa Na \nGia Nghia \n\nTotal \n\nExisting Water Supply \n\nPopulation  Coverage \n\nCapacitya \n\n23,000 \n18,000 \n35,000 \n76,000 \n\n(% HH) \n60 \n0 \n20 \n \n\n1,500 \n0 \n1,500 \n3,000 \n\nProjected Demand by 2015 \n\nPopulation \n\n43,750 \n25,000 \n81,175 \n149,925 \n\nCoverage \n(% HH) \n80 \n80 \n85 \n \n\nAdded \nCapacitya \n4,000 \n2,000 \n12,000 \n16,500 \n\nTotal \nCapacitya \n4,000 \n2,000 \n13,500 \n19,500 \n\nHH = household. \na   m3/day. \nSource: PPTA consultant report. \n \nFor the drainage and wastewater management component, the Project was designed to \n7. \nincrease existing coverage and to service the requirements of the projected urban population in \nthe  project  towns  by  2015  at  rates  ranging  from  40%  to  70%  of  the  total  households  (Table \nA14.2).  \n\n \nTable A14.2: Drainage and Wastewater Management: Existing and Proposed Coverage \n\nTown \n\nTuy Hoa \nSong Cau \nCam Ranh \nThap Cham \nPhan Thiet \nGia Nghia \n\nTotal \n\nCapacity in 2005 \n\nCapacity by 2015 \n\nPopulation \n\n135,000 \n19,000 \n90,000 \n36,000 \n158,000 \n25,000 \n463,000 \n\nCoverage \n(m/capita) \n0.20 \n0.20 \n0.20 \n0.60 \n0.40 \n0.20 \n \n\nProjected \nPopulation \n\n158,000 \n35,000 \n106,000 \n52,000 \n162,000 \n84,000 \n597,000 \n\nCoverage \n(m/capita) \n0.60 \n0.40 \n0.60 \n1.10 \n1.00 \n0.60 \n \n\nCoverage after \nProject (%) \n\n70 \n40 \n45 \n65 \n70 \n60 \n \n\nm = meter. \nSource: PPTA consultant report. \n \nOther Benefits. The Project will generate considerable economic benefits that have not \n8. \ntechnical  constraints.  The  community \nbeen  quantified  mainly  because  of  data  and \nenvironmental  and  sanitation  awareness  provides  targeted  pro-poor  interventions  to  improve \nhealth  conditions  in  the  towns  in  a  more  sustainable  manner  and  is  expected  to  generate \nsignificant  pro-poor  benefits  in  the  form  of  improved  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices  through \nbetter awareness of, and access to, water supply and sanitation facilities. The introduction of a \nsolid waste management services and facilities will pave the way for substantially cleaner town \nenvironments. The Project will provide some of the critical urban\u2013rural links required to ensure \nthat  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  permeate  all  sectors  of  the  participating  provinces, \nparticularly the urban poor who remain isolated by physical and social barriers. As the Viet Nam \neconomy  continues  to  grow  at  an  accelerated  pace,  the  urban  centers  in  the  central  region \nincluding  those  in  the  Project\u2019s  participating  towns  will  play  an  increasingly  pivotal  role  in \nsupporting the economic development of the entire region. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nResults of the Economic Analysis \n\n9. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  water  supply  project  components  was  based  on  the \ncapital  and  O&M  costs  of  the  least-cost  alternative  as  indicated  by  the  calculated  average \nincremental economic costs which range from D2,669/m3 to D5,767/m3. Increasing the supply of \nwater  in  the  project  towns  will  greatly  enhance  the  economic  well-being  of  the  residents. \nValuation  of  the  non-incremental  benefits  accruing  to  the  town  residents  was  estimated  using \nthe average supply price of all alternative sources in the without-project situation. The average \nsupply  price  was  used  as  the  proxy  for  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay,  which  is  difficult  to \nquantify and tends to be understated by residents when surveys are conducted. The prices for \ntube well supplies, surface wells, and river sources, as well as water purchased year-round or \nduring  the  dry  season  from  water  vendors  or  other  households  with  piped  supply  were \nconsidered  in  estimating  the  average  supply  price.  Incremental  sales  were  valued  at  the \nproposed  financial  tariffs.  The  major  indicators  of  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  water \nsupply works in the selected project towns are summarized in Table A14.3. \n \n\nTable A14.3: Economic Evaluation of Water Supply Development and Expansion \n\nTown \n\nBase Case \nEIRR \n\nCapital \n+ 10% \n\nO&M \n+10% \n\nBenefits \n-10% \n\nAll \n-10% \n\nDelay \nBenefits \n\n14.16% \n13.97% \n11.78% \n\n15.52% \n15.36% \n12.90% \n\n14.42% \n14.38% \n12.27% \n\n15.84% \n15.66% \n13.13% \n\n17.08% \n16.96% \n14.17% \n\n16.90% \n16.81% \n14.06% \n\nNinh Hoa \nCa Na \nGia Nghia \nSource: PPTA consultant report. \n \n10. \nAll  base-case  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  exceeded  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital,  which  was  assumed  at  12%,  ranging  from  14.17%  to  17.08%, \nconfirming  the  economic  robustness  of  the  proposed  project  town  components.  Sensitivity \nanalysis  conducted  on  parameters\u2014including  a  10%  increase  in  costs  (likely  to  result  from \ndelayed  or  prolonged  implementation  and  inflationary  factors),  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits \n(likely  to  result  from  poor  quality  implementation  causing  a  deterioration  in  willingness  to  pay \nwhich  can  be  measured  by  a  stronger  reluctance  to  pay  increased  tariffs),  and  delays  in  the \nrealization of benefits (likely to be caused by failure to establish efficiently-functioning provincial \nproject management units [PPMUs] on time)\u2015showed that the EIRRs will be most vulnerable to \nchanges or delays in the realization of anticipated benefits.  \n \n11. \nThe  major  indicators  of  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  drainage  and  wastewater \nmanagement  works  in  the  participating  towns  are  summarized  in  Table  A14.4.

Distribution  and  Poverty  Impact  Analysis. The quantified benefits of the Project were \ndistributed  among  the  following:  (i)  the  consumers,  who  will  benefit  from  the  increased  water \nsupply  and  improved  drainage  and  wastewater  management  in  the  project  towns;  (ii)  the \nGovernment and the economy, who will lose when the economic costs exceed the financial costs; \n(iii) the labor sector, which stands to gain when the financial cost of labor exceeds its opportunity \ncost;  and  (iv)  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  providers,  who  could  lose  because  the  proposed \ntariffs are less than the economic benefits. The distribution of net economic benefits of the Project, \ncalculated at the discount rate of 12%, is shown in Table A14.6. The poverty impact ratio (PIR), \ndefined  as  the  proportion  of  the  total  net  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  accruing  to  poor  and \ncalculated  at 29.92%,  indicates the  pro-poor thrust of  the Project. The  PIR is above 12.6%, the \nestimated average share of the poor in GDP for Viet Nam. \n \n\nTable A14.6.

The  financial \nanalysis  is  conducted  on  the  basis  of  with  and  without  the  Project  to  arrive  at  incremental \nbenefits and costs and undertaken for three components proposed for project provinces: (i) part \nA: water supply development and expansion; (ii) part B: drainage and wastewater management; \nand (iii) part C: solid waste management. The sustainability objective of the financial analysis is \nto assess the ability of the project components to generate revenues sufficient to cover capital \nand operating costs as measured by financial rates of return (FIRRs) that meet or exceed the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to finance the projects.  \n \nA. \n\nKey Assumptions \n\n2. \nKey assumptions applied in the financial analyses are (i) the financial analysis on project \nentities incorporates recommendations for institutional development including tariff reforms, and \nconsiders  only  the  incremental  revenues  and  costs  (capital  expenditures  and  operation  and \nmaintenance [O&M]) directly associated with individual components; (ii) the FIRR and average \nincremental  financial  cost  (AIFC)  are  calculated  over  the  14  year  period,  from  2007  to  2020, \nwhich  incorporates  the  preparation,  construction,  and  operating  periods  of  the  respective \ncomponents;  (iii)  all  revenues  and  costs  are  expressed  in  dong  on  an  incremental  basis  in \nconstant  2006  prices,  with  exchange  rate  of  D15,900/$1.0;  and  (iv)  incremental  revenues  are \nequal to, the projected incremental volume of water sold multiplied by the recommended water \ntariffs (by user group) for water supply; the projected incremental revenue of water sales (as a \nproxy  indicator)  multiplied  by  surcharge  tariffs  (by  user  group)  in  case  of  drainage  and \nwastewater management; and the incremental volume of solid waste collected multiplied by the \nrecommended solid waste tariffs (by user group).  \n \n3. \nAnother key assumption is the estimation of required average tariffs to fully recover all \ncomponent financial costs. This has been done by calculating the AIFC for all projects, i.e., the \npresent values of capital expenditures and O&M costs at financial prices divided by the present \nvalue of the volume of (i) water sold, (ii) water sales equivalent as a proxy, and (iii) solid waste \ncollected  for  each  year  over  the  life  of  the  respective  components.  The  present  values  are \ncalculated  by  discounting  all  cash  flows  at  the  WACC.  The  AIFCs  are  the  minimum  tariff \nrequired for full cost recovery. These are then compared with willingness-to-pay and affordability \nstudies per the socioeconomic and city-specific surveys, and a recommended tariff structure is \nproposed.  These  tariffs  have  been  used  in  the  financial  analysis,  segmented  per  user  group \n(domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial)  based  on  usage  and  affordability. 1 Where  AIFCs  are \nhigher than the recommended tariffs, the difference represents a required financial subsidy from \nlocal authorities.  \n \nThe proposed phased tariffs are summarized in Tables A15.1 to A15.3. For the drainage \n4. \nand  wastewater  component,  a  full  10%  surcharge  on  water  tariffs  is  recommended  to  be  in \nplace by 12 months after loan effectiveness. It is, however, noted that the tariff schedule should \nbe  reexamined  during  the  implementation  period  to  reflect  changes  between  the  dates  of  this \nreport  and  actual  construction  of  the  civil  works.  The  detailed  recommended  tariffs,  full \ncalculations for AIFC and cost-recovery proposals are in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n                                                 \n1   Domestic users are households while commercial users are business premises (registered and unregistered), and \nestablished  institutions  include  schools,  hospitals,  and  Government  administrative  offices.  Industrial  users  are \ndefined as those involved in medium- and large-scale production of commercial commodities, and not sole service \nuser groups.

See Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC. \n\nCosts  have  been  provided  for  O&M  including  depreciation  for  all  projects  and  include \n\nAffordability Analysis \n\n7. \nAIFC  levels  for  collecting  tariffs  were  assessed  with  monthly  household  income  levels \nand monthly bills for water supply, wastewater and drainage, and solid waste were estimated at \nan  average  of  around  4.8%  of  household  incomes  across  project  towns  and  household \nsegments.  Poor  user  groups  will  suffer  greater  impact  from  the  tariffs  and  so,  to  achieve  a \ndomestic below-poverty-level positive poverty impact and affordability levels of 5%, tariffs have \nbeen  adjusted  to  provide  some  cross  subsidy  with  other  user  groups.  For  instance,  10%  of \nmonthly average revenues are considered suitable for calculating tariff levels for industrial and \ncommercial  users  and  typical  payment  patterns  at  present  and  in  line  with  willingness-to-pay \nstudies. It is not recommended, at least in the short run, to increase tariffs for these user groups \nuntil commercial and industrial activities are better developed in all project towns. \n \n8. \nThe  affordability  analysis  for  water  supply,  drainage  and  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \ncollection  services  by  user  groups  is  outlined  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  For  the  domestic \nusers, households in all project towns (even those with income at the poverty line of D1,024,000 \nper month) are willing to pay up to 6.5% of monthly household income. One of the measures to \nsupport  poor  groups  could  be  that  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  and/or  town  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPCs/TPCs) pay for the nonrevenue and public-use through-puts at higher tariffs \nto better able the POEs to recover the tariff revenue as scheduled.  \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nD. \n\nPPC and/or TPC Community Services Obligation Payments (Transparent Subsidies) \n\nWSS  services  normally \n\ninclude  nonrevenue  and  public  use \n\n9. \nthroughputs.  The \nnonrevenue  water,  drainage/wastewater  and  solid  waste  generated  by  public  premises  are \nrecommended to be paid for by the PPCs/TPCs to cover costs of processing these throughputs. \nPayments  should  be  made  through  community  service  obligation  payments  factors  to  be \ndetermined  by  the  specific  tariff study  during  and  after  the  implementation  phrase.  It is  further \nrecommended that the PPCs/TPCs in all towns should enter into service agreements with POEs \nfor  the  annual  transfers  of  such  payments  direct  to  these  accounts  to  ensure  their  financial \nsustainability. For drainage and wastewater components, PPCs/TPCs are recommended to pay \nfor the capital costs by way of transparent subsidies. \n \nF. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n10. \nThe  FIRR  of  the  water  supply  development  and  solid  waste  management  components \nare  estimated  on  the  basis  of  tariffs  outlined  above  and  their  projections  for  water  supply  and \nsolid  waste  collection  based  on  project  components.  For  drainage,  the  AIFC  versus \nrecommended tariff comparisons show the difficulties of cost recovery. Subsidies required have \nbeen estimated and Government will be required to provide for these. Table A15.4 and A15.5 \noutline the FIRRs and sensitivity analyses for WSD and solid waste management components. \nThe base-case and case-sensitive FIRRs are all higher than the WACC of 2.0%. \n \n11. \nThe sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the model. The FIRRs are \nidentified  to  be  most  sensitive  to  the  revenue  reduction  of  10%  and  revenue  delay  (1  year).  As \nsuch, it is recommended that the PPCs and/or TPCs and POEs strictly follow the recommended \ntariffs  and  implementation  schedules.  It  further  implies  that  the  factors  delaying  project \nimplementation should be well under control and minimized to ensure the project financial viability. \n \n12.   Drainage  is  considered  to  be  financially  unsustainable  because  of  largely  nonrevenue-\ngenerating  services.  Hence,  subsidies  will  be  needed  to  cover  O&M  costs  that  have  been \nprojected, and will be provided by the Government.  \n\n \nTable A15.4: FIRRs for Water Supply Development and Expansion \n\nTown \n\nBase Case \nFIRR \n\nCapital \n+ 10% \n\nO&M \n+10% \n\nBenefits \n-10% \n\nNinh Hoa \nCa Na \nGia Nghia \nAll Towns \nFIRR = financial rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Financial analyst estimates. \n\n3.9% \n4.5% \n7.0% \n5.9% \n\n3.2% \n3.6% \n6.0% \n4.9% \n\n3.8% \n4.3% \n6.8% \n5.5% \n\nDelay \nBenefits \n2.8% \n3.0% \n4.7% \n3.9% \n\n2.9% \n3.4% \n4.6% \n4.6% \n\nTable A15.5:FIRRs for Solid Waste Management \n\nBase Case \nFIRR \n\n7.8% \n11.7% \n9.1% \n9.8% \n\nCapital \n+ 10% \n6.5% \n10.2% \n7.6% \n8.3% \n\nO&M \n+10% \n6.6% \n9.7% \n6.4% \n8.0% \n\nBenefits \n-10% \n\n5.0% \n8.1% \n4.6% \n6.4% \n\nDelay \nBenefits \n4.9% \n7.1% \n3.8% \n5.8% \n\nFIRR = financial rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Financial analyst estimates. \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nTown \n\nGia Nghia \nCam Ranh \nSong Cau \nAll Towns \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 11 October 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "dong (D)  \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", "D1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "$0.00006229 \nD16,055.00 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ADB \nAIFC \nDONRE \nEIRR \nFIRR \nIEE \nMOC \nO&M \nPCU \nPOE \nPPC \nPPMU \nPSC \nRF \nRP \nRWG \nTPC \nVWU \nWACC \nWSS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \naverage incremental financial cost \ndepartment of natural resources and the environment \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \ninitial environmental examination \nMinistry of Construction \noperation and maintenance \nproject coordinating unit \npublic operating entity \nprovincial people\u2019s committee \nprovincial project management unit \nprovincial steering committee \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nresettlement working group \ntown people\u2019s committee \nViet Nam women\u2019s union \nweighted average cost of capital \nwater supply and sanitation  \n \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", "C.
