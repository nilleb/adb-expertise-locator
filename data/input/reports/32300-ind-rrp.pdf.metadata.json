An environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF)  for  local  government  infrastructure  development  was \nprepared and is contained in Supplementary Appendix R. \n   \nProject Description  The Project involves the improvement, upgrading and expansion \nof  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  basic  urban \nenvironmental services (water supply, sewerage and sanitation, \nurban drainage, solid waste management, and urban roads and \ntransport)  in  five  municipal  corporations  and  53  urban \nmunicipalities of the State of Kerala. The project also involves \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  state  and \nmunicipal  agencies  in  urban  management  and  urban  services \nprovision,  as  well  as  poverty  reduction  initiatives  developed \nthrough  stakeholder  participation.  Such  initiatives  will  finance \ncommunity-based  infrastructure,  slum  improvement,  and  other \nsocial programs for the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n   \nRationale  Kerala\u2019s  prospects  for  economic  development  are  adversely \naffected by deficiencies in its existing urban infrastructure, which \nhave not kept pace with increasing urbanization. Although water \nsupply coverage is high, water availability is low, ranging from 2\u20133 \nhours  in  Kochi,  Kollam,  and  Thrissur,  to  8-10  hours  in \nThiruvananthapuram.  Water  supply  systems  have  high \nunaccounted-for-water (UFW) and actual average supply is only \nabout 40\u201390 liters per capita per day for people with access to the \nwater  distribution  networks.  Although  most  households  have \naccess to toilets, sewerage and sanitation facilities are generally \ninadequate or nonexistent. On-site sanitation facilities are poorly \nmaintained.  \n \nUrban drainage systems and channels are not properly designed \nor  interconnected  and  are  poorly  maintained.  Wastes  and \nencroachment along drainage channels cause localized flooding \nduring  monsoon  season  and  other  periods  of  high-intensity \nrainfall. Waste burning is common among 40% of the households; \nthe rest throw waste directly into the streets, vacant lots, and open \ncanals.  There  is  no  effective  waste  collection  system  in  the \nmunicipal corporations, except for localized and limited door-to-\ndoor  collection  by  the  Kudumbashree  (Kerala  State  Poverty \nEradication Mission). The urban road network in the municipal \ncorporations,  especially  in  the  old  town  areas,  is  poorly \nengineered and managed. Most urban roads are poorly lit and \n ", "ii   \nhave no pedestrian lanes.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Kerala's  (GoK)  decentralization  policy \ndelegated most urban functions and responsibilities to urban local \nbodies  (ULBs).  However,  ULB's  operation,  management  and \nmaintenance  of  existing  facilities  is  inadequate  and  new \ninvestments  for  infrastructure  development  are  not  being \nundertaken because of (i) lack of revenue causing inadequate \nfunding,  (ii)  lack  of  trained  technical  personnel,  and  (iv)  poor \nplanning and weak implementation capacities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected increase to the growth potential of the \nProject cities and to reduce poverty. The expected outcome of the \nProject is improved quality of life of the urban residents, including \nthe  poor  and  other  disadvantaged  people,  and  greater  urban \nproductivity in the five Project cities.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  is  estimated  at  $316.1  million  equivalent.  The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $107.7 million (34%) and \nlocal currency cost at $208.4 million (66%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  107.7  113.5  221.2  70 \nGovernment of Kerala  0.0  59.8  59.8  19 \nMunicipal Corporations  0.0  35.1  35.1  11 \n Total  107.7  208.4  316.1  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $221.2 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject  agreements.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Government  of \nIndia. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of India will relend the ADB loan proceeds on \nTerms  the same terms as the ADB loan, on back-to-back arrangements. \nGoK will relend the total proceeds in local currency to the five \nmunicipal corporations, on the same terms as the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  The Local Self Government (Urban) Department (LSGUD) will be \nArrangements  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project.  A  state-level  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), headed by a full-time project director, \nwill be responsible for overall project implementation, monitoring \nand supervision, and will report directly to the secretary, LSGUD. \nA state-level empowered committee (EC), will be established with \nfull powers to decide on matters related to the Project. Project \nimplementation units (PIU) will be established in each municipal \ncorporation and will be headed by a project manager. Staff will be \nsourced from state line departments or other offices. A steering \ncommittee will be established in each municipal corporation to \nprovide  overall  monitoring  and  guidance  to  the  PIUs.  The \nmunicipal corporations, in close coordination with Kudumbashree, \nwill  oversee  the  implementation  of  community  infrastructure \nservices and livelihood promotion. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Local Self Government (Urban) Department (LSGUD) of the State \nGoK. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement \nwill generally be carried out by the PIUs, except for equipment and \nvehicles  common  to  all  municipal  corporations,  which  will  be \nprocured  by  the  PMU.  To  the  extent  possible,  goods  to  be \nprocured will be grouped into packages larger than $1 million to \nbe suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nMiscellaneous goods for immediate use that cannot be grouped \ninto a larger contract and that will cost $1 million or less per \ncontract will be procured through international shopping (IS) or \nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures.  Off-the-shelf  items \nand standard products costing $100,000 or less will be procured \nfollowing ADB\u2019s direct purchase procedure. \n \nCivil works contracts over $10 million will be procured through \nICB. Given the nature of the works, civil works contracts costing \n$10  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  LCB  procedures. \nSome  civil  works  such  as  sewage  treatment  plants,  road \nimprovements, and solid waste treatment and disposal sites will \nbe undertaken on a turnkey basis. Equipment, materials or civil \nworks  costing  $100,000  or  less,  including  those  for  use  by \ncommunity-based  organizations,  for  the  poverty  reduction \nactivities related to the funds for community infrastructure services \nand livelihood promotion will be procured following ADB\u2019s direct \npurchase procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- \nand cost-based selection (QCBS) procedures and in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. A total of 2,964 person-months of consulting services \n(78  international  and  2,886  domestic)  will  be  required.  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsulting  firms  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PMU  in  overall \nproject  administration,  management,  and  monitoring.  The \n ", "iv   \nestimated  consulting  requirement  for  the  project  management \nconsultant (PMC) is 396 person-months (78 international and 318 \ndomestic).  Two  domestic  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  as \ndesign and supervision consultants (DSCs) to help the PIUs in \ndaily project implementation activities. A total of 2,688 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be required for the two DSCs \n(1,176 person-months for the southern region and 1,512 for the \nnorthern region). The PMU will also engage a domestic project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) consultant to monitor and \nassess the impacts of the project (45 person-months). \n   \nProject Benefits and  A socioeconomic survey indicates that the top priority of urban \nBeneficiaries  residents is improved sanitation and water supply services. Upon \ncompletion of the Project, the improved water supply system will \nprovide 97,000 new connections that will directly benefit about \n960,000 people in three of the five municipal corporations (Kochi, \nKollam,  and  Thrissur). Improvements  in  the  sewerage  system, \nprovision of sanitation facilities and latrines, storm drainage, and \nsolid waste collection and disposal services will benefit everyone \nin the municipal corporations. Improvements in the urban road \nnetwork will ease traffic movement within the areas of the Project. \nThe integrated improvement of the existing urban infrastructure \nfacilities  and  services  will  provide  significantly  better  living \nconditions  and  enhance  the  surrounding  environment  in  the \nproject cities, especially in poor areas, which will benefit from the \npoverty reduction component. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The potential risks associated with the Project include (i) lack of  \ncommitment  by  the  municipal  corporations  to  undertake  the \nreforms that are needed in urban planning, management, and \nfinance; (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the PIUs, which \nmay  eventually  lead  to  weak  implementation  of  individual \ninvestment  components  in  each  municipal  corporation; \n(iii) implementation delays because of slow progress in start-up \nactivities  (recruiting  consultants  and  setting  up  the  project \nmanagement structure); (iv) lack of funding from the participating \nmunicipalities and the state; (v) lack of fund and personnel to \nsustain  the  facilities  and  services  provided  under  the  project. \nThese  risks  can  be  mitigated  through  action  plans  and \nundertakings by the municipal corporations and GoK. \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Urban Sector in Kerala  \n \n2.  Kerala, located in the southwest of India, is one of the smallest states in terms of area, \ncovering only 1.1% of India\u2019s total land area. The urban local bodies (ULBs) in Kerala consist of \nfive municipal corporations and 53 municipalities. The urban population of Kerala is about 8.3 \nmillion, or about 26% of the state\u2019s total population of 31.8 million (2001 census). Kerala has \nIndia\u2019s best social indicators for literacy (90.9%), life expectancy (73 years, the highest level in \nIndia), and infant mortality (an infant mortality rate of 11 per 1,000 live births, the lowest level in \nIndia).2 \n \n3.  Although Kerala has performed considerably better than most other Indian states in terms \nof social development, urban poverty remains a threat to its future economic growth. In 1974, \nKerala was among the five poorest states in India with 62% of its urban population living below \nthe poverty line. However, Kerala achieved tremendous reductions in poverty during the period \n1983\u20132000, with poverty levels dropping to 9.4% in rural areas and 20.3% in urban areas in 2000.  \n \n4.  Unlike most parts of India, Kerala\u2019s population is fairly uniformly scattered throughout the \nstate. Kerala\u2019s urbanization pattern differs from those in other states; apart from a few panchayats \n(village councils) in the hilly and forested areas, the entire state is an urban\u2013rural continuum, \ncharacterized by dispersed urban settlement patterns. This has been partly responsible for the \nlack of effectiveness of infrastructure investments, which have been spread thinly. \n \n5.  Urban unemployment (10% in 2000) in Kerala is the second highest in India3 and is \nsteadily increasing because of the stagnation of the local manufacturing industry. Employment is \nstill largely generated by traditional handloom and coir industries. Trends in the net domestic \nproduct of the districts containing the five municipal corporations4 show a substantial decline in \nthe primary sector and a slight average annual growth rate in the secondary sector during the \nperiod 1999\u20132003. The growth rate of registered factories and small-scale industries has ranged \nfrom marginal to nonexistent. However, there has been significant growth in the tertiary sector, \nwhich now represents an average of 60% of the economy of the districts. \n \n2.  Municipal Corporations: Performance and Challenges \n \na.  Socioeconomic and Demographic Context  \n \n6.  There  are  five  municipal  corporations  in  Kerala:  Kochi,  Kollam,  Kozhikode, \nThiruvananthapuram  (the  state  capital),  and  Thrissur.  The  combined  population  of  these \nmunicipal  corporations  is  2.5  million.  Kochi  and  Thiruvananthapuram  are  the  most  densely \npopulated and have over 500,000 inhabitants each. The populations of the other three municipal \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) summarizes the impact, outcome, outputs, and activities of the \nProject. \n2  State Planning Board. 2003. Economic Review. Thiruvananthapuram. \n3  Planning Commission. 2001. National Human Development Report. Government of India. \n4  State Planning Board. 2003. Economic Review. India. \n ", "2   \ncorporations range from 300,000 to 450,000. It is projected that the total population of the five \ncities will be about 3.6 million by the completion of the Project (2011) and 6.2 million by 2021. \n \n7.  The five municipal corporations have diverse historical origins, roles and functions within \nthe state (Supplementary Appendix A). The districts where the five cities are located contribute \n51% of the net state domestic product. Trade and commerce and tourism are the major economic \nactivities. Other significant industries include construction, manufacturing, banking and insurance, \ntransport,  community  and  public  services,  and  electricity  supply.  Kochi,  the  second  largest \nmunicipal corporation in Kerala, is host to one of the largest ports in India. Prospects for growth in \nthe five project cities are good. The Tenth 5-Year Plan (2002\u20132007)5 anticipates an annual \neconomic growth of 6.5%, with expected annual growth rates of 5.9% for the secondary sector \nand 8.2% for the tertiary sector. Tourism and industrial development are the sectors with the \ngreatest potential for income and employment generation.  \n \nb.  Urban Poverty \n \n8.  While significant poverty reductions have been made, it is still a significant urban issue. \nThere are much higher levels of poverty in urban areas than in rural areas. Kerala has the third \nhighest  population  density  (819  persons  per  square  kilometer  [km2])  in  India  and  its  urban \nsettlements and slums are overcrowded. The population of slums increased to 1.7 million in 2001 \nfrom about 1.2 million in 1991. About 16% of the urban population in Kerala lives in slums. \n \n9.  A socioeconomic survey6 covering 5,500 households was conducted in the five municipal \ncorporations. While 82% of the nonpoor had direct access to water supply, only 18% of the poor \nhad  their  own  water  facility,  with  54%  depending  on  public  water  facilities,  and  28%  on \nneighborhood facilities. The survey found that 79% of households had access to toilets, although \nthe poor often resort to open defecation. Solid waste is disposed of through burning by 43% of \nhouseholds. Drainage is inadequate and only 24% of respondents expressed satisfaction with \ncurrent facilities. Dissatisfaction with road conditions and the road network was expressed by 47% \nof respondents. \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Inadequate Urban Infrastructure and Services \n \n10.  The provision of basic urban services in Kerala is inadequate and does not meet the \nGovernment of Kerala's (GoK) targets. The poor condition of the existing urban infrastructure and \nfacilities  is  mainly  because  of  physical,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  financial \nconstraints. Although in theory the water supply system covers 90\u201398% of the population in the \nfive municipal corporations, water availability is uneven, ranging from 2 to 3 hours in Kochi, \nKollam, and Thrissur to 8 to 10 hours in Thiruvananthapuram. Nonrevenue water (NRW) ranges \nfrom 55% to 60%.  Water pressure is low, 0 to 3 meters head. The actual average supply is 40 to \n90 liters per capita per day for people with access to the water distribution networks. All of the \nwater supply systems have inadequate and deteriorated transmission and distribution facilities, \nwhich lead to low water pressure and leaks. \n \n11.  Although most households have access to sanitation facilities, sewerage and sanitation \nfacilities are generally poor in all the project cities. Kollam, Kozhikode, and Thrissur have no \nsewerage  systems  while  the  facilities  in  Kochi  and  Thiruvananthapuram  are  not  functioning \nproperly or cover a very limited area. On-site sanitation and septic tanks are not maintained.  \n \n                                                 \n5 State Planning Board. 2002. Tenth 5-Year Plan 2002-2007. Thiruvananthapuram.  \n6 ADB. 2005. Final Report on Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. Manila. ", "3 \n12.  Drainage is poorly maintained and plagued by heavy siltation and clogging, which causes \nlocalized flooding and water logging during the monsoon season and other periods of high-\nintensity  rainfall.  In  most  municipal  corporations,  there  is  a  lack  of  properly  designed  and \ninterconnected drainage channels and networks. Wastes are often dumped in channels and this, \ncombined with encroachment along drainage channels, causes clogging.  \n \n13.  Solid waste management planning has not been systematic because of an absence of \nclear  institutional  responsibilities  for  solid  waste  management,  a  lack  of  skilled  staff  and \nequipment, and funding constraints. There is no effective waste collection system in the municipal \ncorporations, apart from local and limited door-to-door collection by the Kudumbashree (Kerala \nState Poverty Eradication Mission). There are not enough wastebins and they are badly located. \nCollection vehicles are small in number, old, and poorly maintained. Waste is generally thrown \ninto the streets, vacant lots, and drains, or burned at household and disposal sites. Wastes that \nare collected are disposed of in open dumps. Manual loading and unloading of waste is very \ncommon and there is usually no protection for workers. \n \n14.  The urban road network in the cities, and particularly in the old town areas, is congested \nbecause  of  poor  traffic  engineering  and  management.  Narrow  road  widths  and  encroaching \nroadsides affect traffic flow. Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the urban sector in Kerala.  \n \n2.  Urban Institutional Issues \n15.  An inadequate institutional framework and limited local capacities for urban management \nare the major causes of poor urban infrastructure and services. In Kerala, while most of the \ndecentralization recommendations of the First and Second Finance Commissions have been \nimplemented, devolution of authority for some functions and responsibilities has been slow. For \nexample, despite the Kerala Municipalities Act, 1994, and the Decentralization of Powers Act, \n2000, empowering ULBs to undertake future water supply and sewerage service provision within \ntheir jurisdictions, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) continues to own the water supply system \nassets and does most of the maintenance on the water systems in Kerala. GoK has yet to clearly \ndefine the role of KWA or the responsible authority for water supply. Similarly, responsibility for \nurban planning remains with GoK despite the provisions of the 74th Constitutional Amendment in \n1992, which defines new tasks in the functional domain of ULBs.  \n \n16.  On the other hand, ULBs continue to be inefficient. They suffer from weak technical and \nmanagerial capacity and lack skills for effective urban planning and O&M. It is unlikely that they \ncan  undertake  their  newly  delegated  responsibilities  effectively.  While  fiscal  decentralization \nincreased  the  state  allocations  according  to  a  formula  and  enabled  a  high  degree  of  local \nautonomy, ULBs do not have enough resources to discharge their new responsibilities. Most \nurban infrastructure and urban facilities are in a poor condition because of insufficient financial \nrevenue causing insufficient funding. Tariff reforms are needed to mobilize revenues and expand \nthe revenue base. Most ULBs continue to rely on GoK to fund their infrastructure needs, although \nsuch funding is constrained by the state\u2019s fiscal deficit. This vicious cycle of low service provision \nlevels,  low  use  of  services,  and  low  financing  will  require  comprehensive  local  revenue \nmobilization and innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms. Supplementary Appendix B \npresents the current institutional arrangements, which rely heavily on GoK departments for O&M \nof infrastructure investments. \n \n3.  Sustainable Urban Development Financing  \n \n17.  According to an assessment7 of urban services provision in Kerala, the total urban capital \ninvestment requirement is Rs37.8 billion ($840 million) in the medium term and Rs56.0 billion \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005. Urban Sector Review and Strategy for Establishing Kerala Local Government Development Fund. Manila. \n ", "4   \n($1.2 billion) in the long term. A financial assessment (footnote 6) of sample ULBs showed that \nthe average debt\u2013servicing ratio is only 5.3%. The results indicate that there is a considerable \nscope for ULBs to explore nonbudgetary financing sources to enable them to meet urban capital \ninvestment requirements. \n \n18.  Kerala was one of the first states in India to set up a specialized financial intermediary for \nurban development financing, the Kerala Urban Development Finance Corporation (KUDFC). \nHowever, the absence of a project development facility at KUDFC has limited its capacity to \nundertake project preparation. The fact that KUDFC is a public sector organization also limits its \nability to manage its staffing needs effectively and efficiently. As a result, KUDFC has been \nunable to respond to the demands of local governments. Recent decentralization reforms in the \nstate have motivated GoK to improve the institutional and financial capacities of ULBs and it plans \nto transform KUDFC into a viable institution for urban financing. However, the legislative and \norganizational  reforms  will  take  some  time  to  be  completed,  which  may  jeopardize  the \nmomentum. GoK has been exploring an interim arrangement to meet the medium-term financial \ndemands of ULBs.   \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n19.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided 31 technical assistance (TA) grants \ntotaling $17.0 million to India\u2019s urban sector since 1993, and has approved loans for 11 projects in \nthe urban sector totaling $2.6 billion. It has provided TA to Kerala amounting to $3.8 million and \nhas provided assistance through the Cities Alliance for the preparation of a city development \nstrategy for Kozhikode. ADB also approved a loan for the Modernizing Government and Fiscal \nReform in Kerala Program8 in 2002. Appendix 3 summarizes external assistance to India and \nKerala. The proposed project is the first ADB urban sector loan assistance to Kerala. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Urban Development Projects \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s experience of implementing urban development projects in India has provided a \nnumber of critical lessons. Integrated and multisectoral urban development projects are inherently \ncomplex and call for (i) greater coordination of government executing agencies and concerned \nlocal  institutions;  (ii)  stronger  technical,  institutional,  and  administrative  capacities  at  these \ninstitutions; and (iii) the active support and participation of project stakeholders and beneficiaries.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s review of its urban sector operations9 indicated that projects had tended to be \nplagued by start-up delays and slow disbursements in the initial years of implementation. Early \ncapacity building of the project\u2019s executing and implementing agencies is needed to: (i) develop \nan  efficient  management  system  within  the  executing  agency  to  monitor  and  supervise  all \nactivities under the project; (ii) train key project stakeholders on implementation arrangements, \nADB policies and procedures, and urban sector issues in the concerned state; (iii) provide public \nconsultations  and  a  participation  program  to  involve  project  beneficiaries  in  identifying  and \ndeveloping investment components. The use of bridging TA for this purpose under the recently \napproved urban project in Madhya Pradesh10 proved very effective. The loan was made effective \n2  months  after  loan  signing,  compared  with  a  previous  average  of  12  to  18  months.  ADB \napproved a similar TA11  for Kerala in December 2004 to eliminate the risk of start-up delays.  \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

The Project is expected to increase the growth potential of and reduce poverty in the five \nproject cities. The expected outcome of the Project is a better environment, a stronger economy, \nand improved living conditions for the 2.6 million people living in the Project cities and ULBs under \nthe Project. To this end, the Project will (i) improve and expand urban infrastructure and services, \n(ii) enhance livelihoods, and (iii) strengthen urban management, planning, and the financing \ncapacity of institutions, especially the municipal corporations, for sustainable provision of urban \ninfrastructure and services.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The Project will consist of four parts. Part A covers urban infrastructure and services \nimprovement, including the rehabilitation, improvement, and expansion of (i) the urban water \nsupply,  (ii)  sewerage  and  sanitation,  (iii)  urban  drainage,  (iv)  solid  waste  management,  and \n(v) roads  and  transportation.  Part  B  will  directly  target  poor  communities  through  integrated \ninterventions for basic infrastructure and services improvements and livelihood enhancement. \nPart C will provide the ULBs with assistance for urban infrastructure subprojects that contributes \nto an improvement of the living standards of urban populations. Part D is designed to improve \nurban management and institutional development through capacity building activities that will help \nfacilitate sustainability of investments under Part A. Part D will also support project management \nand implementation activities at the project management unit (PMU) at the state level and at the \nproject implementation units (PIUs) at the city level.   \n \n1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure and Services Improvement \n \na.  Water Supply \n \n24.  This component will include (i) improvements to water treatment plants and rehabilitation \nof existing transmission mains and pumping machinery in Kollam, (ii) rehabilitation of the trunk \nwater transmissions in Kochi, (iii) rehabilitation of transmission mains and pumping machinery in \nThrissur,  (iv)  a  leak  detection  program  with  rehabilitation  and  strengthening  of  the  existing \ndistribution network in Kochi, Kollam, and Thrissur, and (v) an increase in and metering of house \nservice connections (including repairs to damaged meters) and installation of bulk water meters.  \n \nb.  Sewerage and Sanitation \n \n25.  In all the municipal corporations except Thrissur, sewerage networks will be rehabilitated \nand expanded and sewage treatment plants constructed. Equipment for sewer maintenance will \nbe supplied. For lower density areas where septic tanks will generally be used, the Project will \nsupply emptying equipment. In Thrissur, where it would not be economic to develop a sewerage \nsystem, the Project will provide facilities for drying and digestion of septic tank sludge.  \n \nc.  Drainage \n \n26.  In all municipal corporations, drainage systems will be improved through (i) rehabilitation \nof existing culverts and construction of new ones, (ii) improvements to main drains and secondary \ndrains, and (iii) construction of new drains to improve the storm water drainage network. \n \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n \n27.  In all municipal corporations, except Thiruvananthapuram, the solid waste collection and \ntreatment  capacity  will  be  increased.  This  will  include  (i)  the  provision  of  dumpers,  refuse \n ", "6   \ncollectors and compactors; (ii) provision of community waste collection containers; and (iii) civil \nworks to develop sanitary landfill sites in Kochi, Kollam, Kozhikode, and Thrissur. Compost plants \nwill be installed by the municipal corporations in Kochi and Kollam.  \n \ne.  Roads and Transport \n \n28.  In all municipal corporations, traffic congestion will be reduced and road safety improved \nthrough (i) improvements to critical roads and junctions by providing pedestrian footpaths, off-\nstreet parking, and bus-bays; (ii) improvements to street lighting on major roads in all cities except \nThiruvananthapuram; (iii) road safety improvements in Kochi and Thrissur through construction of \nfootpaths, traffic islands, and signals; (iv) construction of an underpass in Kollam; (v) construction \nof  pedestrian  subways  under  busy  roads  in  Thrissur,  and  (vi) construction  of  a  flyover  in \nKozhikode  to  enable  effective  and  smooth  traffic  interchange.  Supplementary  Appendix  C \ncontains a summary of the infrastructure components.  \n \n2.  Part B: Urban Community Upgrading \n \n29.  The component will target the poor by combining improvements to the basic infrastructure \nand services with livelihood promotion. It will be implemented in close partnership of civil society \ncommittees. The outline poverty reduction investment plan developed as part of the feasibility \nstudy will be refined during project implementation to provide a systematic basis for interventions. \n \na.  Community Infrastructure and Services \n \n30.  Funds  will  be  available  to  poor  communities  in  the  five  municipal  corporations  for \nimprovements to basic infrastructure (including water supply, sanitation, local drainage, narrow \nroad  paving,  street  lighting)  and  services  for  women  and  children  slum  dwellers  (including \ncommunity halls, day care centers, physical infrastructure for primary health care and education, \nand scaling up of innovative government social programs).  \n \nb.  Livelihood Promotion \n \n31.  Funds will be available to finance programs for income generation, for confederations of \nself-help groups, and for micro-enterprise development. Supplementary Appendix D contains \ndetails of the community infrastructure service and livelihood promotion. \n \n3.  Part C: Local Government Infrastructure Development \n \n32.  The  component  will  help  ULBs  to  develop  and  finance  subprojects  on  water  supply, \nsanitation, solid waste management, roads (including street lighting), transportation, sites and \nservices, area development, and other urban infrastructure. The Local Self Government (Urban) \nDepartment  (LSGUD)  of  GoK  will  provide  the  ULBs  with  technical  assistance  to  develop \nsubprojects and select subprojects for financing.  \n \n33.  GoK  plans  to  establish  a  specialized  financial  intermediary  for  local  government \ninfrastructure financing. Under the Kerala Urban Policy and Action Plan, KUDFC will be reformed \nto make it a more efficient financial intermediary. Once this has been done, ADB may conduct in-\ndepth financial due diligence to assess the capacity of the new financial intermediary to delegate \nthe implementation of the component. Appendix 4 contains details of the Local Government \nInfrastructure Development. \n \n ", "7 \n4.  Part D: Support for Capacity Building and Project Management   \n \na.  Capacity Building for Improved Urban Management  \n \n34.  Capacity building activities will be designed to improve the sustainability of investments \nmade under the Project. At the state level, these activities will be directed at institutionalizing \nsystems to enable the LSGUD to monitor the performance of and oversee service delivery by \nULBs and municipal corporations through databases for municipal services and assets and for \nhuman resources. Also at the state level, staff will be trained in how to establish guidelines for \nuser charges and prepare budget manuals to help LSGUD to develop the financial management \nand revenue capacity of ULBs and municipal corporations.12 At the municipal level, the capacity of \nmunicipal corporations and ULBs to conduct urban planning, asset inventory, prudent financial \nmanagement, revenue mobilization, and explore private sector participation in urban infrastructure \nand services will be improved. In municipal corporations and ULBs, staff will be trained in project \ndevelopment, design, and implementation. Supplementary Appendix E contains details of the \ncapacity building program. \n \nb.  Support for Project Management and Implementation \n \n35.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  help  the  PMU  and  PIUs  in  each  municipal \ncorporation  to  (i)  strengthen  their  project  management  and  implementation  capabilities, \n(ii) prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the  investment  components  of  each  municipal \ncorporation, (iii) support construction supervision and quality control of the civil works under the \nProject,  (iv)  help  in  the  appraisal,  implementation  and  monitoring  of  ULB  subprojects,  and \n(v) contribute to benefit monitoring and evaluation by generating baseline data and assessing the \nimpact of the Project and by providing feedback to the PMU to enable adjustments to be made. \n \nc.  Community Awareness and Participation  \n \n36.  PMU  will  assist  GoK  to  promote  community  awareness  of  the  Project,  including  an \nunderstanding of its long-term benefits. This will strengthen the support of the project beneficiaries \nand stimulate demand for better urban infrastructure and services. Beneficiaries will also be made \naware  of  issues  such  as  water  rates,  user  charges,  and  property  tax  reform.  In  addition, \nbeneficiaries will be informed about how to prevent environmental health-related hazards and \ntheir responsibilities for reducing and avoiding inefficient use of water.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n37.  The  design  of  the  Project  reflects  the  diverse  urbanization  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  levels  of  the  urban  areas  of  Kerala.  Under  part  A,  there  will  be  large  direct \ninvestments in highly urbanized municipal corporations. Under part C, access will be provided to \nfinancial  assistance  to  smaller  less  urbanized  ULBs.  During  project  implementation,  if  GoK \nsuccessfully establishes a specialized financial intermediary for urban development, part C may \nbe implemented by this new financial intermediary, following ADB's due diligence and approval. \nWhile the social and economic benefits of part A and part C will be broadly shared by the general \npopulation, part B will target the poor and disadvantaged in slum areas. Kerala has developed an \neffective way of identifying and targeting the poor under the Kudumbashree framework. Part B will \ntherefore  support  the  poverty  reduction  activities  under  Kudumbashree.  To  ensure  the \nsustainability of project investments, each activity will be implemented by municipal corporations \nand ULBs, instead of by the centralized state agencies, so that maintenance and operation of the \nnew infrastructure will be carried out by those who built it. \n                                                 \n12  Initiatives related to administrative and financial decentralization, financial management and revenue capacity are \ncontained in GoK\u2019s Urban Policy and Action Plan (2002) and State Finance Commission recommendations. The \nsubcomponent on capacity building for improved urban management is designed to support the initiatives. \n ", "8   \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n38.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $316.1 million equivalent (including taxes and \nduties of $21.0 million equivalent), of which $107.7 million (34.1%) is foreign exchange cost, \nincluding $29.3 million earned in interest during construction and other charges, and $208.4 \nmillion equivalent (65.9%) is local currency cost (Table 1 Appendix 5). \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nComponent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  To help finance the Project, the Government of India has requested a loan of $221.2 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, conversion options in accordance with ADB\u2019s conversion \nguidelines, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Borrower will be India. The Government of \nIndia will relend the ADB loan proceeds on the same terms as the ADB loan, with repayments \nover 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years to GoK. The foreign exchange risk will be borne \nby GoK. The Government of India provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were the Governments\u2019 own independent decision and not made \nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n40.  The ADB loan of $221.2 million will finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost, including \ninterest and other charges on the loan during construction, and $113.5 million equivalent, or 54.5%, \nof the local currency cost.13 Local cost financing covers part of the cost of civil works, equipment, \nconsulting  services,  project  management  support,  and  incremental  administration  costs,  but \n                                                 \n13 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in dollar equivalents, with reference only to \ntotal expenditure, in accordance with the policy on cost sharing (ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures \nfor Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Manila). ", "9 \nexcludes land, and duties and taxes. ADB\u2019s financing of the local currency cost is justified given the \nneed for financing for basic urban infrastructure. \n \n41.  In line with the current policy on externally financed projects in India, the Government of \nIndia will make available to GoK the ADB loan proceeds on the same terms as the ADB loan.  GoK \nwill also provide $59.8 million equivalent (19% of the Project cost) as its contribution, part of which \nwill be spent on state level activities (such as the PMU and subprojects). The five municipal \ncorporations will also provide $35.1 million equivalent (11% of the project cost) to finance land \nacquisition, equipment and materials, civil works, consulting services, and the cost of counterpart \nstaff for the proposed PIUs. The financial positions of the municipal corporations and GoK have \nbeen  assessed  and  sufficient  resources  will  be  available  to  meet  counterpart  financing \narrangements.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n42.  LSGUD of GoK will be the Executing Agency of the Project and will be responsible for \noverall  strategic  guidance,  technical  supervision,  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  and  for \nensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s loan covenants. A state-level PMU, led by a full-time project \ndirector, will be responsible for overall project implementation, monitoring and supervision, and will \nreport directly to the secretary of LSGUD. The project director will be assisted by three deputy \nproject  directors:  (i)  technical  (for  components  A,  B[a]  and  C);  (ii) social  and  institutional \ndevelopment (for components B[b] and D[a]); and (iii) finance. The PMU will be staffed by experts in \nurban  planning,  water  and  wastewater  engineering,  urban  roads  and  municipal  engineering, \nprocurement,  environment,  finance  and  accounting,  social  and  community  development, \ninstitutional development and law. The project management organization structure is in Appendix 6. \nA financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted, and weaknesses in the municipal \ncorporations  identified  during  FMA  will  be  rectified  by  the  Project  and  two  TA  projects  (see \nSupplementary Appendix M). The PMU and the PIUs will establish and maintain separate accounts \nand records adequate to identify the incomes and expenditures related to the project. They will be \nassisted by a sufficient number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including an accounts officer. \n \n43.  A state-level empowered committee (EC) will be set up within 1 month of loan effectiveness, \nwith full powers to decide on matters related to the Project. The EC will comprise the state chief \nsecretary, secretaries of LSGUD, Finance, Planning, Water Resources, Minor Irrigation, and Public \nWorks; the executive director of Kudumbashree; mayors of the project municipal corporations; and \nthe project director, as member secretary. After loan effectiveness, the EC will meet regularly to \nreview  project  performance  and  decide  on  major  issues,  such  as  counterpart  funding, \nimplementation bottlenecks, land disputes, procurement, and policy reforms.  \n \n44.  The PMU will be set up by loan effectiveness and will be responsible for (i) appointing \nproject  management  consultants  (PMCs),  two  detailed  design  and  supervision  consultants \n(DSCs), one for Thiruvanantapuram and Kollam, and another for Kozhikode, Kochi and Thrissur,  \n ", "10   \nproject performance monitoring system (PPMS) consultants, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs);  (ii) approving  the  design  of  the  investment  components  prepared  by  the  PIUs;  (iii) \nselecting subprojects of ULBs, obtaining ADB approvals for subproject finance, assisting and \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  subprojects;  (iv)  prequalifying  contractors;  (v)  preparing \nstandard bid documents that comply with ADB guidelines; (vi) monitoring the tendering process, \nreviewing the bid evaluation, and preparing bid evaluation reports for approval by ADB; (vii) \nprocuring equipment and services at the state level; (viii) reviewing community awareness and \nparticipation programs; (ix) ensuring project compliance with loan covenants; (x) coordinating with \nADB on matters related to disbursements; (xi) undertaking institutional development assistance \nand capacity building programs; and (xii) maintaining project documents and submitting timely \nreports to ADB and GoK, including audit reports. The terms of reference of the PMU are in \nSupplementary Appendix F.14 \n \n45.  Municipal corporations will be the implementing agencies for the Project. In each municipal \ncorporation, a PIU will be established by loan effectiveness, headed by a project manager, and \nsupported by specialists in water supply, sewerage, civil engineering, solid waste management, \nurban planning, procurement, environment, finance and accounting, and social and community \ndevelopment. A member of staff seconded to the PIU from the revenue department will handle all \nland acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation issues, including coordination with different \nline agencies involved in the shifting of utility lines, if necessary. Each PIU will comprise about \nseven professional members of staff and the required support staff. The PIU will be assisted by \nthe two DSCs. \n \n46.  In each municipal corporation, PIUs will be guided by a city-level steering committee (SC). \nThe SC will comprise of the mayor, the corporation secretary, the district collector, representatives \nof state-level departments in the municipal corporation (such as the Public Works Department, the \nElectricity Board, KWA, and the Pollution Control Board), standing committee chairpersons of \nhealth,  welfare,  works,  and  finance,  and  representatives  of  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs). PIUs will review project progress, resolve local issues, and provide guidance on policy \nmatters. \n \n47.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for (i)  carrying  out  detailed  surveys,  investigations  and \nengineering designs of investment components; (ii) inviting tenders, evaluating bids and awarding \nworks, and performing contract administration, supervision and quality control; (iii) evaluating work \ndone by contractors and certifying payments; (iv) conducting public awareness campaigns and \nparticipation  programs;  (v)  carrying  out  PPMS  surveys;  (vi)  carrying  out  environmental \nassessments; (vii) ensuring municipal corporations comply with ADB loan covenants; and (viii) \npreparing monthly reports. For the water supply component, the PIU will prepare detailed designs \nof the project with assistance from the DSCs, and will obtain clearance or no objection from KWA \nbefore inviting tenders for the works (as in the case of the Capital City Development Project \nfunded by GoK). Supplementary Appendix G contains the terms of reference of the PIU.  \n \n48.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  detailed  engineering,  procurement,  construction \nsupervision and quality control for the community infrastructure and livelihood promotion activities \nin part B. A committee will be formed in each municipal corporation, consisting of representatives \nfrom  the  municipal  corporation,  NGOs,  and  the  Kudumbashree.  This  will  facilitate  the \nestablishment  of  a  consensus  on  the  proposed  community  upgrading  subcomponents. \nSubcomponents proposed by community development societies, area development societies, and \nNGOs will be reviewed and endorsed by the committee. They will then be submitted to the PIU, \n                                                 \n14  The PMU consists of LSGUD staff and staff seconded from other line departments. Once the project is completed, \nPMU staff members belonging to LSGUD will remain with LSGUD; staff seconded from other line departments will go \nback to their parent departments or may be absorbed in the LSGUD or municipal corporations. ", "11 \nwhich will obtain approval for implementation from the city-level SC. Kudumbashree will continue \nto play an active role in advising and monitoring activities facilitating poverty reduction. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n49.  The Project is expected to be implemented over a period of 5 years. Lessons learned from \nother  ADB  urban  projects  in  India  indicate  there  is  a  risk  of  start-up  delays  and  slow \ndisbursements in the initial years, brought about by (i) delays in recruiting consultants, and (ii) the \ntime taken to complete preparatory work before contracts are awarded. The TA project Capacity \nBuilding  for  Kerala  Sustainable  Urban  Development15 will  help  GoK  to  develop  preliminary \ncapacity  at  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  so  they  can  (i)  develop  an  efficient \nmanagement system within the LSGUD to monitor and supervise all the project  activities; (ii) train \nkey project stakeholders on implementation arrangements, ADB policies and procedures, and \nurban sector issues in Kerala; and (iii) provide public consultations and a participation program to \ninvolve project beneficiaries in investment component identification and development. Appendix 7 \nsummarizes the implementation schedule for the Project. \n \n3.  Procurement \na.  Civil Works, Equipment and Materials \n50.  Goods, works and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. All procurement contracts will contain anticorruption provisions as \nspecified by ADB. Procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the guidance of the \nPMU, except for equipment and vehicles common to all project cities, which will be procured by \nthe PMU. Equipment and selected materials will be procured using international competitive \nbidding (ICB), international shopping (IS), and local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures as \nappropriate. To the extent possible, goods to be procured will be grouped into packages larger \nthan $1 million to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous goods for immediate use that \ncost $1 million equivalent or less and cannot be grouped into a larger package will be procured \nthrough IS or LCB procedures. Off-the-shelf items and standard products costing the equivalent of \n$100,000 or less will be procured following ADB\u2019s direct purchase procedures. \n \n51.  Civil works will be packaged according to the type of work, experience available in and \nlikely interest by local or international contractors, time required for detailed engineering designs, \npreparation of bidding documents, and other relevant factors. These factors will be considered \nwhen deciding whether civil works should be procured through ICB or LCB procedures. However, \ncontracts over $10 million will invariably be procured through ICB, while those of $10 million or \nless will be procured following either LCB or ICB procedures. Some civil works, such as sewage \ntreatment plants, solid waste treatment and disposal, will be undertaken on a turnkey basis. \nCertain items costing the equivalent of $100,000 or less (including community infrastructure works \nand items that are part of poverty reduction activities) will be procured through ADB\u2019s direct \npurchase procedures. Indicative procurement packages are presented in Appendix 8. \n \nb.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n52.  The Government of India and GoK have requested ADB to approve (i) advance action to \nrecruit  consultants  and  to  procure  goods  and  civil  works,  and  (ii) retroactive  financing  of \nreasonable expenditures incurred under the Project, including consultants, civil works and goods. \nAdvance action is necessary to expedite project implementation and retroactive financing will \nease the Government\u2019s budgetary constraints. Retroactive financing will be made available to a \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for the Capacity Building for Kerala Sustainable Urban Development. \nManila. \n ", "12   \nmaximum  of  $33.2 million  equivalent  (15%  of  the  proposed  loan  amount)  for  reasonable \nexpenditures incurred under the Project. Expenditures should have been made not earlier than a \nmaximum of 12 months before the date of the Loan Agreement through to the effective date. The \nGovernment of India and GoK have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action and \nretroactive financing does not constitute a commitment to finance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n53.  Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants and CBOs.  \n \n54.  Consulting services will be provided in three packages. An international consulting firm will \nbe the PMC. In association with domestic consulting firms, it will help the PMU in overall project \nmanagement. The PMC will also assist the PMU and PIUs in project formulation, management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, financial and environmental management, implementation of poverty \nreduction programs, and the selection of subprojects by ULBs. The PMC will review the inputs of \nthe DSCs, and the PPMS consultants and advise the PMU and PIUs accordingly. The estimated \nstaffing requirement for the PMC is 396 person-months (78 international and 318 domestic), \ndivided among three international professionals and nine domestic professionals.  \n \n55.  Two domestic consulting firms will be engaged as DSCs to assist the PIUs located in the \nmunicipal  corporations  to  carry  out  detailed  engineering  design,  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices, construction supervision, quality control, community awareness, and poverty reduction \nprograms.  One  DSC  will  assist  the  PIUs  in  the  southern  region  (covering  Kollam  and \nThiruvananthapuram), and another will assist the PIUs in the northern region (covering Kochi, \nKozhikode, and Thrissur). The estimated staffing requirement for the DSCs is 2,688 person-\nmonths  (1,176  person-months  for  the  southern  region  and  1,512  for  the  northern  region). \nDomestic firms bidding for the DSC consulting packages will not be eligible to associate with any \ninternational firm bidding for the PMC consulting package. Domestic firms may bid for both DSC \nconsulting packages but can be selected for only one. A full technical proposal will be required for \nfirms bidding for PMC and DSC packages.  \n \n56.  The PMU will also engage a domestic PPMS consultant to help the PMU to generate \nbaseline data, provide guidance for mid-course correction, and assess the project benefits after \nfull implementation. The estimated staffing requirement for the PPMS consultants it is 45 person-\nmonths. Simplified technical or biodata proposals will be used to recruit PPMS consultants. The \nterms of references for the consulting service packages are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n5.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n57.  The physical components included under the Project were selected in order to minimize \nland  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  relocation.  Most  of  the  proposed  improvements  and \nconstruction  will  be  on  land  owned  by  the  municipal  corporation  or  by  another  government \nagency.16 The  total  land  acquisition  requirement  is  about  1.55  hectares  (0.09  hectares  for \noverhead water tanks and 1.46 hectares for sewage pumping stations). There may be a need to \ntemporarily displace or relocate hawkers and vendors during road improvements and pipe laying \nfor water, sewerage and sanitation, and drainage. If necessary, alternative temporary spaces will \n                                                 \n16 For the proposed sewerage treatment plant in Kollam, Kollam municipal corporation has been acquiring the land. Due \ndiligence was conducted on the resettlement activities at the proposed sewage treatment plant site in October 2005. \nNecessary  procedures,  government  orders,  plans  and  budget  were  set  by  the  municipal  corporation.  The \ncompensation package conforms to the basic principles of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and there is no \noutstanding issue on the resettlement between the municipal corporation and the affected people. ", "13 \nbe provided nearby to minimize the disruption to the economic activities of the hawkers and \nvendors.  The  total  number  of  people  affected  by  the  Project,  and  the  significance  of  the \nresettlement impacts, if any, can only be estimated after the detailed design of the components. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement requirements are summarized in Supplementary Appendix \nI.  A  resettlement  framework  providing  guidelines  on  preparing  resettlement  plans  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. A resettlement plan will be formulated for each subproject which will \nhave any resettlement impacts. A short resettlement plan for Kollam roads is in Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n6.  Indigenous Peoples  \n58.  The Project is unlikely to have any impacts on indigenous peoples in Kerala, as activities \nwill be concentrated in urban areas where few indigenous peoples are to be found. However, \nbecause of the approach to be followed in Part C (see para. 32), there is a slight possibility that \nindigenous peoples may be directly or indirectly affected by some subprojects. The indigenous \npeoples development framework (IPDF) in Supplementary Appendix L provides guidelines on \nformulating  appropriate  development  planning  instruments  such  as  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plans or \"specific actions\u201d to address such impacts. \n \n7.  Operation and Maintenance \n59.  The Project will be implemented by the PIU. O&M of the investments under the Project will \nbe funded by municipal corporations through the introduction and revision of user charges and \ntaxes when components have been completed.17 \n \n60.  As municipal corporations are not currently equipped to plan, implement, operate and \nmaintain  the  proposed  investments  under  the  Project,  capacity  building  and  training  will  be \nundertaken.  During  project  implementation,  the  PIUs  will  receive  hands-on  experience,  in \ncollaboration  with  the  DSCs,  and  will  participate  in  procurement,  contract  management, \nconstruction  supervision,  and  other  activities.  The  use  of  turnkey  contracts  with  a  sufficient \ncommissioning period will provide PIUs an opportunity to learn proper O&M techniques. PIUs will \nacquire technical and operational skills throughout the project implementation period which they \ncan use for long-term asset creation, asset management, and service provision.18  \n \n61.  There has been limited private sector participation in urban service delivery in Kerala. \nAlthough there is potential for private sector participation (especially in O&M), inadequate capacity \nof municipal corporations will constrain outsourcing to the private sector in the near future. The \nstrategy for private sector participation in the delivery of urban services requires a multifaceted \napproach involving (i) an enabling regulatory framework; (ii) technical and managerial skills within \nmunicipal  corporations  to  formulate  and  manage  private  operations;  (iii)  transparent \nprequalification, tendering, and contracting processes; and (iv) implementation of charges and \nfees at reasonable levels. The capacity building component will explore the scope for private \nsector participation in O&M activities in the short term. It is envisaged that there will be private \nsector participation in the solid waste composting component.   \n \n                                                 \n17 Existing water supply systems owned by KWA will continue to be owned, operated, and maintained by KWA. \nImproved facilities under the Project will be transferred to KWA. However, new and/or extended water supply \nsystems will remain with the municipal corporations. In the case of the Thrissur municipal corporation, improvements \nto and expansion of the distribution network will be retained by Thrissur municipal corporation, in line with the \ndevolution and with ownership of the distribution system by the municipal corporation. \n18  Following completion of the Project, the PIU will be merged with the municipal corporations\u2019 engineering departments \nto establish a strengthened city planning and engineering department, responsible for overseeing spatial planning, \ninfrastructure development and construction, and provision of sewerage, sanitation, and solid waste management. \n ", "14   \n8.  Anticorruption Policy \n62.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nof India/GoK and LSGUD. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n63.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook19   and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations  for  LIBOR-based  Loan \nProducts.20 An imprest account will be established at the Reserve Bank of India to expedite \nimplementation of the Project through the timely release of loan proceeds. A second generation \nimprest account (SGIA) will be opened by GoK in a non-interest-bearing current account with a \ncommercial bank. The amount to be maintained in the imprest account and the SGIA at any time \nwill not exceed 10% of the Loan or estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, whichever is \nlower.  The  imprest  account  and  the  SGIA  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement \nOperation for LIBOR-Based Loan Products as sated as one, and detailed arrangements agreed to \nby GoK and ADB; ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used to reimburse \neligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account. Any individual \npayments of to be so liquidated or reimbursed shall not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n64.  Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the PMU, will be audited \nby duly qualified  and independent auditors and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the \nclose of each fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, the \nSGIA, and the SOE procedure, and a separate audit opinion on the use of the SGIA and SOE \nprocedures. \n \n11.  Reporting Requirements \n65.  GoK, through the Government of India, will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on \nproject implementation, consolidated by the PMU from the PIUs. These progress reports will \ndescribe physical progress, details of any modifications required to the schedule, implementation, \nutilization of loan proceeds (particularly under component B), and an outline of the work for the \nnext quarter. The report will also provide summary financial accounts of the Project, including \nexpenditure during the quarter, year-to-date expenditure, and total expenditure to date. The PMU \nwill also submit to ADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project \ncompletion report that will cover the details of implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation \nactivities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001.

Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) \n66.  The PMU will be responsible for ensuring that the project performance monitoring system \n(PPMS)  is  established  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  will  track  project \nimplementation activities, target dates, expected outcomes, and assigned responsibilities. Some \ntasks will be outsourced to external contractors, others will form part of routine reporting from the \nPIUs to the PMU. The indicators to be monitored will be formulated, discussed and agreed by \nADB, GoK and municipal corporations (see Supplementary Appendix N for details on the project \nperformance monitoring system). Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the PMU will conduct \ninitial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for \nbenchmarking information and monitoring performance. This will be subject to ADB\u2019s review and \nconcurrence. The PMU will submit annual reports to ADB throughout project implementation.  \n \n13.  Project Review \n67.  Project performance will be reviewed first by the PMU, second by the EC, and third by \nADB. The first-level review will be conducted every month by the PMU. It will be based on monthly \nperformance reports prepared by the DSC for each project city. The report will be sent to ADB, \nthe EC, the LSGUD, and the city-level SCs for their action. The second-level review will be \nconducted every quarter by the EC. The monthly reports on project performance, major policy \nissues, and actions required or taken by the respective authorities will be reviewed. The results \nwill be circulated to ADB, LSGUD, and the SCs. The third-level review will be conducted by ADB \nevery 6 months throughout the project implementation period. A comprehensive midterm review \nwill  be  carried  out  24  months  after  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness  to  identify  problems  or \nweaknesses in implementation arrangements, and to agree on any corrective measures. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Major Benefits and Impacts \n \n  1.  Social and Poverty Impact \n \n68.  Basic urban services in the municipal corporations are in urgent need of upgrading and \nimprovement. Although water supply coverage is at least 90% in all municipal corporations, \navailability and water pressure are low, enabling residents to consume only 40\u201390 liters per capita \nper day, well below the minimum standard of 135 liters per capita per day prescribed by the \nGovernment of India for urban areas. A socioeconomic survey21 of 5,500 households in the five \nmunicipal corporations (with 65% of the households coming from poor and low-income groups), \nrevealed that 54% of poor households depend on public water facilities (stand posts and open \nbore hole wells) while 28% of the poor households depend on neighborhood facilities. In the five \nmunicipal  corporations,  8%  of  the  households  surveyed  used  public  toilets  while  7%  of  the \nhouseholds practice open defecation. Open defecation is reported mainly in poor households. \nAbout 40% of households burn their waste, 20% compost their waste, and 9% throw their waste \non the streets and in open areas. Most poor households experience frequent flooding, and road \nand  traffic  conditions  also  affect  poor  and  low-income  commuters,  making  them  prone  to \naccidents or security problems.  \n \n69.  The proposed improvements in water supply will provide about 97,000 new connections, \nwhich will benefit the majority of poor and low-income households. About 25% of the population \nliving below the poverty line will directly benefit from new sewerage facilities and about 23% of \nthem will directly benefit from improved sanitation, which will be provided in densely built-up \nareas. The sanitation component will improve access to toilets in poor areas. Efficient solid waste \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2005. Final Report on Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. Manila. \n ", "16   \ncollection or disposal and improved drainage will reduce flooding and will indirectly benefit all \ncommunities by leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. Road improvements will improve \nthe quality of urban living by providing easier and faster access to and from the city to the urban \nfringes, where most of the poor live. The time savings and health benefits from improved access \nto urban infrastructure services will provide time and resources for the beneficiaries to engage in \nmore productive activities and to pursue better economic opportunities. The beneficiaries among \nthe urban poor of the improvements in each infrastructure component are estimated as follows: \nwater supply, 281,000; sewerage and sanitation, 244,500; storm drainage, 119,500; solid waste \nmanagement,  118,100;  and  roads  and  transportation,  62,600.  Appendix  9  summarizes  the \npoverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \n70.  The urban management and institutional development component aims to strengthen the \ncapacity of all stakeholders to engage in participatory planning. This will enable them to respond \nto the needs of local communities, especially the poor, to ensure smooth implementation of the \nproject components. The community infrastructure and livelihood promotion subcomponents will \ncomplement direct project benefits and the positive impact of the project on the poor. \n \n  2.  Gender Impact \n \n71.  The Project will aim to improve the income, employment, and access to entrepreneurial \nactivities of women in Kerala, who will be the primary focus of the poverty reduction initiatives.  \nThe Project will provide assistance to enable women to become self-sufficient and raise their \nposition  in  society.  Community  development  societies,  area  development  societies,  and \nneighborhood groups consisting mainly of women are well-organized in slum areas and interact \nregularly with the urban poverty alleviation cell in each municipal corporation. Mechanisms to \naccess  these  groups  are  already  in  place  at  municipal  corporations.  These  groups  will  be \nencouraged to participate in the planning, design and implementation of the poverty reduction \ncomponents. \n \n72.  During  project  implementation,  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  involving  women  in  the \nmainstream of project planning and implementation will be developed. The gender action plan \nincludes  intensive  awareness  programs  and  community  infrastructure  planning  and \nimplementation with the full involvement of women. The urban management and institutional \ndevelopment component will train local government officers in gender awareness and gender \ndevelopment. There will be equal opportunities for qualified women in the hiring of personnel for \nthe project. The gender action plan, which covers project preparation, project implementation, and \nproject monitoring and evaluation was prepared with specific objectives and target activities.  It is \ndesigned to mainstream gender considerations in the project cycle, to encourage women to \nbecome involved, and to ensure tangible benefits accrue to women (see Supplementary Appendix \nO).  \n \n3.  Economic Analysis \n \n73.  All  the  project  components  have  a  strong  economic  rationale,  since  they  provide \nacceptable minimum standards for basic living conditions, and help to remove constraints on \nsocial development and economic growth. All components have been based on sound principles \nof priority and need, they incorporate demand forecasts, and they represent least-cost technically \nfeasible options, with an emphasis on rehabilitation. All project components are economically \nviable, with the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) values exceeding the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  in  all  cases.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  most \nsensitive to the extent to which the new urban services attract and retain the targeted number of \nusers and beneficiaries. See Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix P for the economic \nanalysis.  \n ", "17 \n74.  The project cities cannot afford to continue system improvements or to increase service \ncoverage. Current taxes and fees are low and GoK has not increased the tariff for 10 years. The \ncities need to improve their ability to raise resources. The socioeconomic survey showed that \nthere was a willingness to pay more for the municipal services, but active public relations and \nsocial marketing activities will be needed to confirm this willingness to pay. Affordability was \nassessed, based on proposed tariffs, household incomes, and subsistence level of consumption \nThe  results  showed  that  the  proposed  tariffs  for  water  supply,  sewerage  and  solid  waste \nmanagement are within the generally acceptable limit of not more than 5% of average household \nincome.  \n \n4.  Financial Analysis \n \n75.  An indicative financial improvement action plan has been formulated to ensure sufficient \nfunds  are  available  at  each  municipal  corporation  so  they  can  operate  and  maintain  the \ninvestments under the Project. Currently, water tariffs are low and are insufficient to sustain the \nrequired O&M of the water supply and distribution network. Property taxes have not been revised \nsince 1999, and tax collection efficiency in the five municipal corporations ranges from 45% in \nThiruvananthapuram  to  84%  in  Thrissur.  Appendix  11  summarizes  the  indicative  financial \nimprovement action plan. \n \n76.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental \ncosts and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of the implementing agencies \nwith and without project scenarios. The financial internal rates of return (FIRR) for the water \nsupply and solid waste management schemes, computed on an after-tax basis, range from 5% to \n18%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed on an \nafter-tax basis, of 4%. The water supply and solid waste management schemes are considered to \nbe both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for \neach component and the project overall are robust under most conditions. With respect to the \nsewerage schemes, the proposed tariffs are not sufficient to cover full costs, but are sufficient to \ncover operating and maintenance costs in the future. GoK and the municipal corporations have \nagreed to subsidize the capital requirements for the project and, given the positive cash flows \nduring operations, these components are considered to be financially sustainable. The detailed \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n5.  Policy and Institutional Action Plan \n \n77.  A policy and institutional action plan has been drafted to ensure that policies are in place \nto (i) enable municipal corporations to assume responsibility for urban planning and undertake \npreparation of citywide development plans; (ii) increase accountability in service provision and \nstreamline  municipal  systems  and  procedures;  and  (iii)  improve  financial  management  and \naccounting reforms in the five municipal corporations. A summary of the policy and institutional \naction plans is in Appendix 13. \n \n6.  Environmental Aspects \n \n78.  The Project has been classified as environmental category B. As part of the project \npreparatory  TA,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  project \nsubcomponents in all five municipal corporations covered by the Project. The IEEs showed that \nnone of the proposed components would have significant adverse environmental impacts. The \nsummary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix Q. Anticipated minor environmental impacts include \nsome loss of on-site ecology and the conversion of small amounts of rural agricultural land; dust \ngeneration due to excavation activities; and increased vibration, noise, fumes and traffic during \n ", "18   \nconstruction. Mitigation measures have been proposed to minimize impacts from inadequate \nmaintenance of sewerage systems and/or gases generated during the decomposition of solid \nwaste. Significant environmental benefits resulting from the Project include improved hygiene and \nsanitary conditions in all municipal corporations; better waste handling, treatment and disposal; a \nhealthier ecosystem because of the reduction in the waste discharged into protected areas; a \ndecrease in water losses resulting from the currently defective water distribution system; and \nbetter  air  quality  as  a  result  of  improvements  to  traffic  and  road  conditions.  Environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs) were drawn up for sanitary landfill sites and sewage treatment plants \nto be financed by the Project. \n \n79.  As  subprojects  will  be  identified  during  implementation  of  Part  C,  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) (Supplementary Appendix R) was prepared. This puts \nin place the procedures for environmental assessment and review of future subprojects. \n \nB.  Major Risks and Safeguards \n \n80.  While no unusual risks are foreseen during implementation, the potential risks associated \nwith the Project include, (i) lack of commitment by municipal corporations to undertake reforms in \nurban planning, management, and finance, (ii) lack of suitably qualified personnel in the PIUs, \nwhich may eventually lead to weak implementation of investment components; (iii) implementation \ndelays because of slow progress in start-up activities (e.g., in recruiting consultants and setting up \nthe project management structure); (iv) lack of funding from the participating municipalities and \nthe state, and (v) lack of fund and personnel to sustain the facilities and services provided under \nthe project.  \n \n81.  Most of these potential risks can be mitigated through a financial improvement action plan \nand a policy and institutional action plan. Several reforms are covered by the recommendations of \nthe State Finance Commission. The ADB Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala \nProgram22 will help improve the overall governance of state and local governments. These reform \ninitiatives will require broad consultation with different segments of Kerala society, given the \nstate's highly participatory political system. Given the high level of educational achievement, it \nshould not be difficult to find technical expertise within the state, but advance actions supported \nby ADB TA are required to ensure that skills are available to PIUs.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n82.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of India and GoK have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  GoK  will  allocate,  and  ensure  that  municipal  corporations  allocate  counterpart \nfunds  from  their  annual  budget  in  order  to  meet  the  counterpart  funding \nrequirements of the Project. GoK will also ensure that each municipal corporation \nwill make available all necessary land, staffing and facilities as required for timely \ncompletion of subprojects.  \n(ii)  By midterm review of the Project, GoK will develop a road map on the role of KWA \nand relevant statutory authorities/ULBs for water supply in the area covered by the \nProject to ensure empowering these with related services and cost recovery in \naccordance with the Kerala Municipalities Act 1994 and Decentralization of Powers \nAct, 2000. \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002.

The Urban Sector in Kerala. Kerala, located in the southwest of India, is one of the \nsmallest states in terms of area covering only 1.1% of India\u2019s total land area. Based on the 2001 \ncensus, the total population of Kerala is about 31.8 million, which is about 3.1% of India\u2019s total \npopulation. The urban population of Kerala is about 8.3 million, or about 26% of the state\u2019s total \npopulation.  The  urban  sector  in  Kerala  consists  of  five  municipal  corporations  and  53 \nmunicipalities. The total population in the five municipal corporations was 2.5 million in 2001.  \n \n2.  The urban population in Kerala increased steadily from 16.3% in 1971 to 26.0% in 2001. \nThe urban population growth rate declined from 26.4% in 1991 to 26.0% in 2001 and the annual \npopulation growth rate of 0.9% is lower than the national average (2%). It has been estimated that \nthe population in Kerala will increase by 15% in absolute terms over a 20-year period (2001\u2013\n2021)1. The urban population is expected to reach 9.5 million by the end of the project design \nyear, 2021. Kerala has the third highest population density (819 persons per square kilometer \n[km2]) in India, behind West Bengal (904 persons per km2) and Bihar (880 persons per km2). High \npopulation  density  and  significant  urban  poverty  has  led  to  overcrowding  in  Kerala\u2019s  urban \nsettlements and slums. The 2001 census showed that the population living in slum areas had \nincreased to 1.65 million in 2001 from about 1.22 million in 1991. About 18% of the urban \npopulation in Kerala lives in slums2. \n \n3.  In 2001, the sex ratio in Kerala urban areas was 48.6% males and 51.4% females. The \nliteracy rate is 90.9%, very high compared with the national average of 65.3%. The urban literacy \nrate is about 93.4%. Life expectancy in Kerala is 73 years, compared with the national life \nexpectancy of 61 years. Kerala had the lowest total fertility rate (TFR) in India in 1998 at 1.8 and \nthe lowest infant mortality rate (IMR) in 2001, estimated at 16. The National Human Development \nReport3 of the Planning Commission estimated the human development index for Kerala to be \n0.638, which is higher than the HDI of 0.472 for India as a whole.  \n \n4.  Although Kerala has performed considerably better than most other Indian states in terms \nof social development, urban poverty remains a threat to its future economic growth. In 1974, \nKerala was among the five poorest states in India, with 62% of its urban population living below \nthe poverty line. Kerala achieved tremendous reductions in poverty during the period 1983\u20132000, \nwith poverty levels in Kerala dropping to 9.4% in rural areas and 20.3% in urban areas in 2000. \nWhile these figures are lower than the national poverty levels of 27.1% in rural areas and 23.6% \nin urban areas, urban poverty in Kerala remains significant.  \n \n5.  Unlike most parts of India, Kerala\u2019s population is uniformly scattered throughout the state. \nKerala\u2019s urbanization pattern differs from those in other states; apart from a few panchayats in \nhilly and forested areas, the entire state is an urban\u2013rural continuum characterized by dispersed \nurban settlement patterns. This has been partly responsible for the reduction in the effectiveness \nof infrastructure investments, which have been spread too thinly over Kerala. High population \ndensity in urban areas has compounded urban poverty. Urban unemployment (10% in 2000) in \nKerala is the second highest in India (footnote 3) and is steadily increasing because of the \nstagnation of the local manufacturing industry. High costs of construction materials, increases in \nland values, high unemployment, and lack of economic opportunities mean that more urban poor \nfamilies are forced to live in slum areas, where living conditions are poor and drinking water and \nsanitation facilities are completely inadequate. Based on a survey by the Town and Country \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Final Report on Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. Manila. \n2  Based on the sample of seven towns covered in the Census of India 2001. \n3  Planning Commission. 2001. National Human Development Report. India. \n4  Census of India 2001. ", "Appendix 2  27 \nPlanning  Department  (TCPD)  in  1996,  there  were  354  slum  settlements,  with  a  combined \npopulation of about 185,900 in the 5 municipal corporations. \n \n6.  Urban Infrastructure and Services in Kerala. About 32% of households in Kerala live in \nsemi-pucca and kutcha (half-cement and/or mud made) dwelling structures, with about 10.9% of \nhouseholds living in one-room dwelling units. About 71.6% of households have access to drinking \nwater  within  their  premises,  70.2%  of  households  have  access  to  electricity,  and  65.2%  of \nhouseholds  have  access  to  water  closet  type  latrines.  Except  for  the  low  and  inadequate \nsewerage coverage in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi, sewerage is almost nonexistent in Kerala. \nOnly 11.7% of households have access to open drainage for wastewater outlets, while about \n77.5% of households still use firewood as fuel for cooking.4 Solid waste collection is poor across \nall cities in the state, involving open, unhygienic street collection points and considerable double \nhandling. Most cities operate composting plants but surplus waste is disposed of in open dumps.  \n \n7.  Basic Urban Infrastructure and Services in the Five Project Cities. The assessment of \nthe existing situation of urban infrastructure in the project cities identified several deficiencies in \nthe provision of basic urban services, which fall below GoK's own targets. The deficiencies are \nmainly due to physical, operational, maintenance, and financial constraints. \n \n8.  Water Supply. More than 90% of the population in the project cities has access to city \nwater supply systems. However, because of operational deficiencies, the actual average supply is \nonly  about  40\u201395  liters  per  capita  per  day  for  people  with  access  to  the  water  distribution \nnetworks. Unaccounted-for-water in the project cities is very high, ranging from 55% to 60% of \ntotal water production. Water is available from 2\u20133 hours, to 8\u201310 hours in the cities at low water \npressures of 0\u20133 meters head. All of the water supply systems have inadequate and deteriorated \ntransmission and distribution facilities, which result in low water pressure and leaks. Unauthorized \ntapping into water mains further aggravates losses and leads to contamination. More than 50% of \nthe households surveyed are not connected to piped water supply and water tariff collection is \nlow, with many customers not being charged at all. Existing ground and surface water sources are \ntheoretically still adequate to meet current water demand. Alternative sources of water are usually \nshallow open wells or tube wells. Water quality is generally acceptable, except for occasional \ncases  of  bacteriological  contamination  in  areas  with  unsanitary  environments  and  illegal \nconnections.  \n \n9.  Sewerage and Sanitation. Although most households have access to sanitary facilities, \nsewerage and sanitation facilities are generally poor. Kollam, Thrissur and Kozhikode have no \nsewerage  systems,  while  the  sewerage  facilities  in  Thiruvananthapuram  and  Kochi  are  not \nfunctioning adequately and cover very limited areas. No sewerage systems have been completed \nsince the 1980s because of the huge investment required and the inadequate revenues. On-site \nsanitation and septic tanks are not maintained, which contributes to pollution and threatens public \nhealth. Data from the Kerala Urban Development Project (footnote 1) show that 43\u201360% of slum \nhouseholds have no latrines within their premises.  \n \n10.  Urban Drainage. Localized flooding and water logging during monsoon season and other \nperiod of high-intensity rainfall is common in all project cities because of the lack of properly \ndesigned  and  interconnected  drainage  channels  and  networks.  Most  existing  canals  have \ninadequate carrying capacity. Urban drainage systems and canals are poorly maintained and  \nsolid wastes are dumped in the canals, causing clogging. Uncontrolled encroachment along \ndrainage channels has also affected the efficiency of the existing drainage systems.  \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n11.  Solid Waste Management. Waste generation rates in the project cities range from 0.2\u2013\n0.73 kg per person per day. Of the waste generated, 60\u201385% is collected and disposed of. Waste \nis generally thrown directly at collection points, in open dumps, on the streets, and on vacant lots \nbefore collection, while the rest is burned at household premises or dumped in open canals. Solid \nwaste management has not been systematic because of the absence of a clear organization \nresponsible for solid waste management, lack of skilled staff, and funding constraints. There is no \neffective waste collection system in the project cities, except for localized and limited door-to-door \ncollection by the Kudumbashree. There are not enough wastebins and they are badly located. \nCollection  vehicles  are  small  in  number,  old,  and  badly  maintained.  Waste-pickers  collect \nrecyclable wastes such as paper, cans, bottles, and metals. There are no disposal facilities for \ninfectious and hazardous wastes. Manual loading and unloading of waste is very common and \nthere is usually no protection for workers.  \n \n12.  Roads and Transportation. Deficiencies in the road network (especially in the old town \nareas), inadequate traffic engineering and management, too little parking, and inadequate and \ninefficient public transport facilities are common problems in all project cities. Narrow roads and \nencroachment of roadsides affect traffic flow. The absence of bus bays and pedestrian lanes \nslows vehicular traffic. Expansion, road widening, and construction of new road infrastructure will \nprobably be constrained by right-of-way, land acquisition, and resettlement issues.  \n \n13.  A socioeconomic survey covering 5,473 households in the five project cities revealed that \nonly 18% of the poor have their own water facilities, 54% depend on public water facilities, and  \n28% on neighborhood facilities. On average, 79% of households in the five cities have their own \ntoilets,  8% use  public toilets,  6% share  toilets  with  their  neighbors,  and  7%  resort  to  open \ndefecation. Solid waste is disposed of on the street and in open areas by 9% of households, while \nabout 43% burn their waste. Collection of solid waste is done by Kudumbashree in 9% of the \nhouseholds, while a few NGOs collect solid waste in 10% of households. The survey showed that \nthe community priority is water supply (first priority), sewerage and sanitation (second priority), \nand urban drainage (third priority), and solid waste management (fourth priority).  \n \n14.  Urban  Sector  Issues  and  Challenges.  While  Kerala  ranked  third  in  India  in  the \ninfrastructure  index  at  178.68,5  and  has  an  outstanding  record  in  social  developments,  its \nprospects for economic development have been adversely affected by deficiencies in its urban \ninfrastructure, which have not kept pace with increasing urbanization. With GoK's decentralization \npolicy, most urban functions and responsibilities were delegated to local governments. However, \ngrowing fiscal deficits and inadequate funding for new infrastructure development, combined with \npoor planning, weak implementation capacities, and poor operation and maintenance capacities \nof local governments have led to a deterioration of most urban infrastructure and facilities.  \n \n15.  Appropriate, efficient and effective urban development strategies must be developed for \nKerala. Such strategies must address the needs of the urban population and improve accessibility \nto  and  affordability  of  basic  urban  services,  especially  by  the  urban  poor,  and  ensure  the \nsustainability of urban infrastructure facilities and the delivery of basic urban services. A concerted \nand participatory approach to urban development and implementation will improve basic urban \nservices and environmental conditions.  \n \n16.  Current external assistance in the urban sector in Kerala is limited. Apart from ADB, only \nthe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) of the United Kingdom are involved in urban development. JBIC is assisting \nimprovements to water supply and sanitation, while DFID is involved in slum upgrading in Cochin. \nADB is currently providing assistance under the Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in \n                                                 \n5  Tenth Five-Year Plan 2002\u20132007.

Urban Sector Development by Urban Local Bodies \n \n1.  Urban Sector Development Policy. The Government of Kerala (GoK) is committed to \nurban sector development through decentralized administrative, legal and institutional reforms. \nBy the Kerala Municipalities Act, 1994, functions were transferred from the state to urban local \nbodies (ULBs), which consist of five municipal corporations and 53 municipalities. Following the \n1996 decentralization planning campaign, almost 40% of the state's development expenditures \nhave  been  transferred  to  ULBs  and  most  urban  functions  have  been  delegated  to  ULBs. \nHowever, because of insufficient experience of project planning, implementation, and resource \nmanagement in ULBs, the gap between the demand and supply of basic urban services has not \nbeen narrowed. As a result, the existing urban infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating as operation \nand maintenance is inadequate, while the fast pace of urbanization continues. \n \n2.  GoK  is  trying  to  sustain  the  momentum  of  reform  by  introducing  changes  in \nadministrative, legal, and institutional frameworks to meet the urgent investment requirements \nfor basic urban infrastructure. Recent reform initiatives include (i) the Kerala Municipality Act, \n1994, which made the ULBs key local institutions; (ii) the Kerala Urban Policy and Action Plan, \nwhich  provided  a  policy  framework  and  urban  planning  strategy  for  development  and \nmanagement in the state; and (iii) the Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala \nProgram,1 which is decentralizing powers as an integral component of good governance. \n \n3.  Constraints on Urban Sector Development. Despite these decentralization efforts, \nmost ULBs are unable to provide better public services. This is due to (i) insufficient access to \nfinancial resources, and (ii) lack of project preparation and implementation capacities. With the \nGrants from the State to ULBs and the current cap on the provision of state-level guarantees, \nULBs are unable to access nonbudgetary sources of financing. This results in a vicious cycle of \nlow service provision, low use of services, and low tax and revenue collection. Ultimately this \nmeans there is not enough money for sustained investments and upgrading, operation and \nmaintenance  of  existing  services.  ULBs  need  better  access  to  finance  and  need  to  build \ncapacity building to break this vicious cycle. \n \n4.  Urban Infrastructure and Services in Kerala. About 32% of the households in Kerala \nlive in semi-pucca and kutcha (half-cement and/or mud made) dwelling structures with about \n10.9% of the households living in one-room dwellings. About 71.6% of households have access \nto drinking water within their premises, 70.2% have access to electricity, and 65.19% have \naccess to water closet type latrines. Except for the low and inadequate sewerage coverage in \nThiruvananthapuram and Kochi, sewerage is almost nonexistent in Kerala. Only 11.7% of the \nhouseholds have access to open drainage for wastewater outlets, while about 77.5% of the \nhouseholds still use firewood as fuel for cooking. Solid waste collection is poor across all cities \nand involves unhygienic street collection points and considerable double handling. Most cities \noperate composting plants, but surplus waste is disposed of in open dumps.  \n \n5.  Needs for Urban Sector Development Finance. Financial projections indicate that \nmore than $1 billion investments is needed for urban sector development over the next 15 \nyears. A pilot assessment of public services provision and financial status conducted in four out \nof the 53 municipalities in Kerala (Chenganassery, Neyattinkara, Palakkad, and Payyanur), \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Cluster \nof Loans to India for the Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala Program. Manila. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nestimated that the per capita investment requirement for basic urban services (including water \nsupply, sewerage and sanitation, drainage, roads, transport infrastructure) is Rs13,840 in the \nmedium term (2006\u20132010) or Rs20,506 in the long term (2006\u20132020). Using the estimated per \ncapita investment requirement and the total urban population (2001 census) in the 53 ULBs, it is \nprojected that the total urban capital investment requirement is Rs38 billion ($840 million) in the \nmedium term or Rs56 billion ($1.24 billion) in the long term. \n \n6.  Financial Position of ULBs. An analysis of the past financial performance of the four \nsample municipalities showed that the average debt-servicing ratio was only 5.3%, indicating \nconsiderable scope for accessing borrowings. In the short term, the total borrowing capacity is \nestimated at Rs2.09 billion ($46 million), while the investment capacity is Rs3.48 billion ($77 \nmillion). In the long term, the borrowing capacity is about Rs21.84 billion ($485 million), while \nthe investment capacity is Rs36.4 billion ($809 million). The pilot assessment shows that there \nis  a  huge  potential  for  municipalities  to  explore  nonbudgetary  financing  sources  such  as \nborrowings and capital markets.  \n \n7.  Financial Intermediary for ULBs. Kelara has a financial intermediary for ULBs but it is \nunable  to meet  the  growing  financial needs  of  ULBs. Kerala  Urban  Development  Finance \nCorporation (KUDFC) is a public sector financial intermediary, intended to assist small-scale \nurban  development  projects  of  ULBs.  It  owns  and  manages  its  assets,  but  has  limited \nindependence to, for example, recruit or dismiss professional staff, put in place flexible pay \npackages, or offer performance incentives. Since the performance in asset management is not \nrewarded, KUDFC has little incentive to promote its financial products or to create new products \nand services. As a result, despite the demand, KUDFC is not able to support the larger urban \ndevelopment projects of ULBs, which include water supply, sewerage, sanitation, drainage, and \nsurfaced road projects. KUDFC\u2019s project and technical appraisal capacity is also limited. There \nis no facility for project development and advisory services, which would help ULBs to design \nappropriately sized projects with sound financial and accounting practices. \n \n8.  As noted in the Kerala urban policy and action plan, GoK plans to reform KUDFC into a \nmore efficient organization. It will be separated into an asset owner and an asset management \ncompany.  However,  the  legislative  and  organizational  reform  will  take  sometime  to  be \ncompleted  and  this  may  jeopardize  the  momentum  of  urban  sector  development  through \ndecentralization. To meet the immediate needs of ULBs, the Local Self Government Urban \nDepartment (LSGUD) of GoK will help them tpo develop and finance subprojects on a demand \nbasis through Component C of the Project.   \n \nB.  Local Government Infrastructure Development \n \n9.  ULBs will be helped to develop and finance subprojects on water supply, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, roads (including street lighting), transportation, sites and services, area \ndevelopment, and other urban infrastructure. The LSGUD will provide the ULBs with technical \nassistance so they can develop subprojects. It will select subprojects for financing based on the \neligibility criteria and its own assessments. The total amount of $21.4 million will be allocated for \nsubproject financing as a part of  Part C; Local Government Infrastructure Development of \nwhich $15 million will be sourced from the ADB Loan. \n \n10.  Under the Kerala urban policy and action plan, KUDFC will be reformed into a more \nefficient financial intermediary. Once the new financial intermediary is established, ADB may \nconduct in-depth financial due diligence to assess the capacity of the new financial intermediary \nto support implementation of the component. \n ", "Appendix 4  35 \nC.  Institutional Analysis \n \n11.  LSGUD is in charge of urban development in the state of Kerala. It has experience of \nfinancing projects in ULBs, including Rs850,000 for recycling of solid waste in Changanassery \nmunicipality. LSGUD oversees the functioning of the urban ULBs through the Directorate of \nUrban Affairs (DUA) and three regional offices at Kollam, Kochi and Kozhikode. Secretaries of \nthe ULBs report to the secretary of LSGUD through the director of DUA.  \n  \n12.  The Director of DUA is responsible for administrative and financial management of \nULBs, including (i) appointing staff in ULBs and undertaking disciplinary actions if required; \n(ii) transferring state funds to ULBs and budget control; (iii) administering the pensions and \nprovident funds of municipal staff; (iv) providing the LSGUD with support for policy matters and \nreforms; (v) allowing ULBs to borrow from KUDFC; (vi) undertaking overall supervision and \ncontrol of activities in the ULBs; and (vii) overseeing the functions and decisions of the three \nmissions, namely, the Information Kerala Mission, the Clean Kerala Mission and the State \nPoverty Eradication Mission. \n \n13.  The  regional  directors  supervise  the  ULBs,  including  (i)  conducting  inspections; \n(ii) carrying out performance audits every 3 months, on behalf of the State Performance Audit; \n(iii) undertaking grievance redress; (iv) undertaking performance appraisal of ULBs with regard \nto resource mobilization; (v) reviewing no-confidence motions against municipal chairpersons; \n(vi) preparing reports on plan fund utilization for submission to the Minister for LSGUD; and (vii) \nreviewing compliance of ULBs with the local fund audit report and submitting the local fund audit \nreport to the Director of DUA. \n \nD.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria \n \n14.  Subprojects. Projects financed under this component may be (i) revenue-generating or \nself-financing projects, (ii) non-revenue-generating projects, or (iii) social and environmental \nprojects where limited user charges may be collected. Eligible subprojects should be given high \npriority in the ULBs\u2019 capital expenditure program and may be part of the following sectors or \nsubsectors: water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, roads (including street lighting), \ntransportation,  sites  and  services,  area  development,  and  other  urban  infrastructure  that \ncontributes to the improvement of living standards of urban populations. The subprojects must \nmeet  the  eligibility  criteria  on  economics,  finance,  administrative  procedures,  procurement, \ndisbursement,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards.

No \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Kerala:  Improvements to the delivery of basic urban \ninfrastructure and services in urban areas, especially to low-income and poor households and settlements, is crucial to \nenhancing the quality of life and the environment of these areas. Access to basic urban services, such as adequate \nand potable water supply, sanitation and solid waste disposal facilities, adequate drainage, and other basic services \nhas a direct impact on poverty reduction, by improving health, living conditions, and the environment. Better basic \nurban  services  help  to  improve  peace  and  order  as  well  as  in  stimulating  economic  activity  and  generating \nemployment in urban areas. \n \nAlthough Kerala has notable social development indicators, urban poverty continues to be a threat to its future \neconomic growth. The unemployment rate (about 10% in 2000) is the second highest in India and local manufacturing \nindustry has stagnated. High urban population density has aggravated the problems associated with the inadequate \ndelivery of urban services. Most of urban infrastructure and services have deteriorated and have not kept pace with \nurbanization, partly because of budgetary constraints, poor operation and maintenance, and weak technical and \ninstitutional capacities of the implementing agencies.  \n \nUrbanization in Kerala is unlike that in other states, since its population is uniformly scattered throughout the state and \nurbanization is not concentrated in specific areas. Except for a few rural settlements in forested and hilly areas, Kerala \nis as an urban\u2013rural continuum, with a dispersed urban settlement pattern. This urbanization pattern has limited the \neffectiveness of the infrastructure investments because of the wide area of coverage.  \n \nThe Project is expected to catalyze economic development and address urban poverty through improvements to \nurban infrastructure facilities and services, urban management, and institutional development. About 2.46 million \nurban residents in the five Municipal Corporation stand to benefit directly from the Project. It is estimated that \nimprovements in water supply will directly benefit 281,000 urban poor residents; sewerage and sanitation, 238,600; \nstorm drainage, 119,500; solid waste management, 118,300; and roads and transportation, 62,600. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nKerala used to be among the five poorest states in India. However, from 1974 to 1994, poverty declined remarkably,  \nfrom 40.4% to 25.4%, which is the second highest decline of all Indian states and reduced the poverty level to less \nthan the national average of 26.3%. The decline in poverty from 1994, however, was largely attributed to poverty \nreduction in rural areas, which declined from 25.8% in 1994 to 9.4% in 2000. The reduction in urban poverty was \nmarginal, from 25.43% in 1994 to 20.27% in 2000. To date, urban poverty in Kerala is more than double that in rural \nareas, and may increase further if unemployment and lack of economic opportunities in urban areas are not \naddressed immediately.      \n \nKerala is one of the smallest states in India in terms of, covering only 1.1% of India\u2019s total land area. It has the third \nhighest population density, 819 persons per km2 based on the 2001 census. The population living in slum areas \nincreased from 1.22 million in 1991 to 1.65 million in 2001 because of high unemployment and the high cost of \nconstruction materials. About 32% of the households in Kerala live in semi-cemented/mud dwellings made essentially \nfrom mud and cement, with about 10.9% of households living in one-room dwellings. About 71.6% of households have \naccess to drinking water within their premises, 70.2% have access to electricity, and 65.19% have access to water \ncloset type latrines. Only 11.7% of households have open drainage for wastewater outlets while about 77.5% still use \nfirewood as fuel for cooking. \n \nBased on the baseline survey conducted for the five municipal corporations, only 18% of the poor have their own \nwater facility. 54% depend on public water facilities, while 28% depend on neighborhood facilities. On average, 79% of \nhouseholds in the five cities have their own toilets while 8% use public toilets, 6% share toilets with their neighbors, \nand 7% resort to open defecation. Solid waste is disposed of on the streets and in open areas by 9% of the \nhouseholds, while about 43% burn their wastes. Collection of solid waste is done by Kudumbashree (Kerala State \nPoverty Eradication Mission) in 9% of households while a few NGOs collect solid waste in 10% of households. \nDrainage is inadequate and is the second priority of the respondents in terms of other urban services. Diarrhea and \ntyphoid affect at least 3% of poor households. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 9pendix 4 \nMost of the poor (64%) depend heavily on daily wages as their source of income.  Unemployment among the poor is \n14%. While the state has provided some basic urban services, these services are inadequate and do not reach the \npoor or most economically vulnerable households.   \n \nThe proposed Project will directly improve the quality of life and increase the economic opportunities of the urban \npoor, especially women and children. The community infrastructure and services and livelihood promotion component \nwill help the municipal corporations to implement urban poverty reduction programs. \n \nUrban Management Improvement \n \nProject preparation will include capacity building for local governments so they can integrate poverty reduction into \ntheir programs. Participatory planning and community involvement in project identification and priority setting will \nensure that the needs of the poor are taken into consideration.  \nThe poor will be empowered through networking and community development, livelihood initiatives and income \ngeneration, and an education and information campaign on health and sanitation.  \n \nWomen will be targeted by consultations, community development activities, and training on income generation. \n \nProject staff and consultants will be trained on gender sensitivity analysis to ensure that gender concerns are taken \ninto consideration in project design and implementation. \n C. Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nMany  consultations  were  held  with  officials,  senior  executives,  and  technical  staff  of  the  state  and  municipal \ncorporations. Target beneficiaries and households were consulted and surveyed (approximately 5,470 households, \nabout 1% of the total, were surveyed) in each of the five municipal corporations.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA sustained participatory approach has been followed throughout to ensure that the Project meets the needs of the \nbeneficiaries and communities, and that anticipated benefits are achieved and maximized. Stakeholder consultation \nand participation will be conducted throughout implementation in coordination with municipal corporation officials, \nNGOs, and other stakeholder groups. Monitoring of achievements and benefits will also be undertaken with the \nassistance of all concerned groups.  \n \nPublic relations and community awareness programs, training, capacity building, and institutional strengthening, \nmonitoring and evaluation are included in the project scope.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen and children will directly benefit from improved urban services. They will find it easier to access water. \nWomen\u2019s health and the environment in which they live will be improved by better sanitation, solid waste collection, a \nreduction in flooding, safer roads, and more lighting.  \n \nPoverty reduction programs will provide women with greater economic opportunities that will complement the savings \nin time from better and more efficient urban services. \n \nThe gender action plan provides for the employment of women under the Project and for their remuneration to be \ncomparable to that for men for the same work.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Economy and Urban Sector \n \n1.  Economy in Kerala. Despite the growing state economy, the Government of Kerala \n(GoK) has continual revenue and fiscal deficits. The fiscal deficits as a percentage of gross \nstate domestic product (GSDP) ranged from 4.1% to 5.6% between FY2000 and FY2002. \nIncreasing  deficits  and  reductions  in  non-wage  and  non-interest  expenditures  have  led  to \ninadequate public investment in infrastructure and a decline in operation and maintenance. \nRecent investor surveys and low levels of foreign direct and private investment indicate a weak \ninvestment climate. \n \n2.  Urban  Infrastructure  in  Kerala.  The  urban  infrastructure  in  the  five  municipal \ncorporations of Kochi, Kollam, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram, and Thrissur is inefficient and \ninsufficient. It fails to distribute social goods equitably to the entire population. The water supply \nsuffers large operational losses and its coverage is limited. Public provision of sewerage and \nsanitation and solid waste management is either nonexistent or inadequate. This has increased \nillegal or improper disposal, leading to greater public heath risks, blockages of the drainage \nsystem, and deterioration of the living environment. Economic activity and urbanization have \nincreased traffic volumes, but the existing road network cannot cope with the increased traffic \nflow, jeopardizing the safety of pedestrians and residents near roads. Unfortunately, however, \nthe  poor  situation  of  state  finances  has  resulted  in  inadequate  public  investment  in \ninfrastructure, which in turn creates inefficiencies in the urban economy. \n \nB.  Demand and Needs for Urban Infrastructure \n \n3.  Water Supply. The three project municipal corporations has been suffering from high \nunaccounted-for-water (UFW), ranging from 55% to 60% of total water production. There are \nthree  major  reasons  for  this.  First,  all  water  supply  systems  have  poor  transmission  and \ndistribution facilities and therefore high operational losses. Second, unauthorized tapping into \nwater  mains  causes  further  losses  and  contamination.  Third,  lack  of  water  metering  and \ndefective meters makes it difficult to collect user charges. Income from tariff collection covers \nonly 53% of operation and maintenance costs. \n \n4.  As a result of the high UFW, water is available for limited periods (2\u201310 hours) at low \nwater pressures of 0\u20133 meters head, and consumers receive only 40\u201388 liters per capita per \nday (lpcd) on average. The intermittent supply has caused significant wastage, since consumers \ngenerally rely on stored piped water, which will be thrown away at the end of the day and refilled \ndaily. To cover the supply deficiency, people have to rely on other sources, such as rainwater, \ntube wells, and bottled water, to meet the shortfall in supply. In other words, consumption is \ndetermined by server supply constraints rather than demand.  \n \n5.  There are two implications of the current limited supply of piped water. First, the water \nsupply needs to be expanded if the national standard of 135 lpcd, established by the Central \nPublic Health Environmental Engineering Organization (CPHEEO), is to be reached. Second, \nwater supply needs to be increased to serve the expanding urban population, projected to grow \nat 4.5% to 7.5% per decade for the next 25 years.  Supplementary Appendix O contains a \ndetailed analysis. \n \n6.  Sewerage and Sanitation. As water consumption increases, the volume of wastewater \nalso increases. Three of the five municipal corporations do not have underground sewerage \nsystems and rely on septic tanks at each premises. De-sludging, maintenance and proper \n ", "Appendix 10  47 \ndischarge of effluent have not been carried out regularly because there is no provision for \nintegrated  wastewater  management.  The  other  two  municipal  corporations  have  sewerage \nsystems, but coverage and treatment capacities are limited, which means that most sewage is \ndischarged into open road drains which flow into canals. As a result, the Biochemical Oxygen \nDemand (BOD) level in the canals is estimated at more than 200 grams per cubic meter (g/m3) \nand the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) level is estimated at 300 g/m3. Contamination of the \ncanals has a long-term effect on the lives of people who use them as a source of water, as well \nas on the ecology of the canals and on tourism. Sewage discharge needs to be treated so BOD \nlevels are reduced to less than 30 g/m3 and TSS levels to less than 50 g/m3 before it flows into \nthe canals, in order to meet the national standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control \nBoard. Supplementary Appendix O contains a detailed analysis. \n \n7.  Storm Drainage. A large proportion of the population would benefit from a proper \ndrainage system during heavy rains. The five municipal corporations have average annual \nrainfalls of 1,800 mm to 2,300 mm, and Kochi municipal corporation in particular suffers from \nregular flooding. The absence of an interconnected network of drainage channels, clear outlets \nand regular maintenance causes water logging and flooding in many congested areas of the \ncities.  A  household  survey  in  the  five  municipal  corporations  showed  that  only  24%  of \nhouseholds are satisfied with current drainage facilities and that the five municipal corporations \nregard improvements to drainage as either their first or their second priorities. Supplementary \nAppendix O contains a detailed analysis. \n \n8.  Solid Waste Management. Projections1 of solid waste generation in each municipal \ncorporation in indicate that the situation will be unmanageable by 2031 unless there is effective \ntreatment  and  disposal  of  solid  waste.  Further  economic  development  and  urbanization  in \nKerala will increase the amount of waste generated in the municipal corporations. Per capita \nwaste generation growth is estimated at 1.4% per year, and the urban population in the five \nmunicipal corporations will increase by 5% to 7.5% per decade for the next 25 years. Domestic \nsolid waste collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal are inadequately implemented in the five \nmunicipal corporations, because of the absence of dedicated public waste management bodies, \nand the lack of collection, transfer and treatment equipment. As the amount of waste grows, \nmunicipal corporations will have to improve collection and transfer efficiency through additional \nwaste treatment facilities and landfill sties. Supplementary Appendix O contains a detailed \nanalysis. \n \n9.  Road  and  Transportation.  The  growth  in  the  urban  population  and  in  economic \nactivity  has  increased  the  volume  of  traffic,  and  further  increases  are  projected  by  2014 \n(footnote 1). A traffic survey (footnote 1) has projected an increasing volume of traffic in the \nmajor roads, which will lead to heavy congestion. \n \nC.   Project Rationale \n \n10.  The long-term forecast for population growth and delivery of urban services up to 2030 \n(footnote 1) showed that demand for urban services and infrastructure exceeds supply (see \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Final Report on Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. Manila. \n1  Reduction in non-revenue water will achieve through (i) reduction in leakage in distribution networks and (ii) \nencouraging users to shift from stand post to piped water which results in reduction in consumption from stand \npost. \n ", "48  Appendix 10pendix 4 \nSupplementary  Appendix  O  for  details).  However,  there  are  indications  that  a  portion  of \npopulation is willing to pay additional fees for improvements, which could cover the investment \nand maintenance costs. \n \n11.  Improvements to urban infrastructure will ultimately lead to greater economic growth in \nKerala.  About  50%  of  GDP  in  India  is  generated  in  the  urban  areas,  where  28%  of  the \npopulation lives, and the estimated per capita productivity ratio between the urban and rural \npopulations is 7:2. This suggests that further economic growth will be dependent on urban areas \nand their ability to attract investment and increase productivity. This, in turn, depends on the \ncapacity of cities to deliver proper urban infrastructure services and to provide an adequate \nurban  environment,  amenities,  and  quality  of  life.  However,  GOK  does  not  have  enough \nfinancial resources to invest in the urban infrastructure, so the most cost-effective approach \nmust be followed.  \n \nD.  Consideration for Alternative Design \n \n12.  Water Supply. Improvements to the water supply will be achieved primarily by reducing \nUFW, which will allow (i) the metered connection to be expanded to meet current and future \ndemand without increasing production capacity, and (ii) the supply per person to be increased to \nCPHEEO standards, which will enable them to obtain water when the need arises, without \nrelying on expensive alternative sources.  \n \n13.  Rehabilitation  of  the  existing  water  supply  system,  including  treatment  plants, \ntransmission and distribution networks, will be the first priority. It has been estimated that the \ncapacity of the existing water treatment plant will be until at least 2031; the major problem is not \nproduction capacity but the wastage in transmission and distribution, estimated at up to 60% of \nthe  volume  produced.  Increasing  the  supply  capacity  would,  therefore,  be  economically \ninefficient and technically impractical. As a result, rehabilitation of existing transmission mains \nand distribution networks is proposed in the three municipal corporations. \n \n14.  Sewerage and Sanitation. Sewerage and sanitation improvement will be achieved by \nreducing the load on the natural environment by preventing illegal discharges into rivers and \ncanals.  This  will  require  (i)  expanding  catchment  areas,  (ii)  increasing  the  number  of \nconnections,  and  (iii)  building  sewage  treatment  plants  with  the  capacity  to  meet  Central \nPollution Control Board standards. \n \n15.  Sewerage systems are not the cheapest option, but they are the only choice for high-\ndensity urban areas, since the amount of space for septic tanks and access roads to each \nhousehold  for  de-sludging  is  restricted.  As  part  of  least-cost  analysis,  per  capita  costs  of \ninvestment, and operation and maintenance of a sewerage system, septic tanks, and twin pit \npour flush latrine systems in different population density areas were compared. The capital \ninvestment analysis indicates that a sewerage system is more economical than septic tanks \nwhen the area has a population density of more than 80 people per hectare. On the other hand, \noperation and maintenance costs are four to nine times higher for a sewerage system than for \nseptic tanks. Technically, however, septic tanks and twin pit pour flush latrine are not suitable \nfor areas with population densities of more than 60 people per hectare, since it is hard to secure \nspace for construction and for access for de-sludging. \n \n16.  In order to select the most suitable sewage treatment plants, the capital, operation, and \nmaintenance costs of four different methods of treatment were considered. The results indicate \nthat  the  size  of  the  land  area  is  the  major  cost  factor  and  any  economic  advantages  in \ntechnology, operation and maintenance are overridden by the high price of land. The method \nwith the minimum land requirement is therefore the least-cost solution, namely, fluidized aerobic \n ", "Appendix 10  49 \nbed reactors. For the network, the design in each municipal corporation will depend on the \nroutes that maximize gravity in order to minimize pumping. \n \n17.  Storm Drainage. Rehabilitation of existing drainage and canals is the first priority. For \ndisconnected drainage networks and underserved central urban areas, construction of new \ndrainage is proposed, The new drainage will connect with other networks along existing roads, \nwhich has minimum social impact. \n \n18.  Solid Waste Management. Improvement in solid water management will be achieved \nby reducing the load on the natural environment by preventing illegal dumping. This will require \n(i)  expanding  catchment  areas,  (ii)  increasing  the  number  of  people  receiving  services, \n(iii) installing solid waste treatment plants in order to reduce the volume of the collected solid \nwaste, and (iv) establishing sanitary landfill sites with the capacity to meet Central Pollution \nControl Board standards. \n \n19.  The most economical combination of waste treatment and disposal, taking capital and \noperational  costs  into  consideration,  is  composting  and  disposal  to  sanitary  landfills.  This \ncombination generates revenue through the sale of compost and helps to prolong the life of \nlandfill sites by reducing waste at compost plants. \n \n20.  Alternative options for waste treatment have been identified for each city, based on the \ncomposition of the solid waste. In all municipal corporations, 40% of solid waste wet is organic \nsubstance, characterized as low combustible quality with a high degree of moisture. Incineration \nis  technically  feasible,  but  it  is  expensive  to  incinerate  low  combustible  wastes  at  high \ntemperature and specialized skills are needed to minimize the environmental risks associated \nwith endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Composting, on the other hand, is an economical and \ntechnically feasible option. Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur municipal corporations \nalready rely on compost plants and have developed a market for compost. Wastes with high \norganic content are suitable for composting, so organic, inorganic, and hazardous wastes are \nalready being separated at source and collection in some municipal corporations on a pilot \nbasis. These initiatives will be extended and improved during the project period. Composting will \nreduce the volume of organic waste to a third of its original volume, which will prolong the life of \nlandfill sites.  \n \n21.  Sanitary landfill is the most economical way of minimizing the risks to the environment. \nImproved waste segregation will prevent hazardous wastes from entering the sanitary landfill. \nThe location of the sites will depend on the availability of land, its price, the distance from \ncentral urban areas, geographical characteristics, and environmental impacts on the vicinity and \nthe access roads. \n \n22.  Road and Transportation. Improving existing roads will be the first priority, in order to \navoid the major resettlement associated with constructing new roads. Construction of pedestrian \nways, streetlights and bus terminal will increase the traffic safety of pedestrians and nearby \nresidents on busy roads. \n \nE.   Economic Costs and Benefits Analysis \n \n23.  In order to assess the economic efficiency of project investments, the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) in 20 years has been estimated. Prices were adjusted to economic price by \nusing a standard conversion factor of 0.91, estimated from export, import and tax data. The \nshadow wage rate was estimated at 0.75, to reflect unemployment and underemployment, \nwhich  indicates  a  lower  opportunity  cost  for  unskilled  labor.  Detailed  assumptions  will  be \nprovided upon request and Supplementary Appendix O contains a detailed analysis. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 10pendix 4 \n24.  Costs  Across  Sectors.  Three  types  of  economic  costs  were  identified:  (i)  project \ninvestment  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  (ii)  user-charge  expenditure  by  the \nhousehold, and (iii) the effects of loss of access and other types of disruption to residents due to \nworks during the construction phase. The cost of investment is approximately Rs5.0 billion at \npresent value for all sectors. It is estimated that operation and maintenance for all sectors for 20 \nyears will amount to Rs2.7 billion at present value. The user charges are cost to the households \nbut income to the KWA and municipal corporations. Since by its nature costs are transferred, \nhousehold  expenditure  on  user  charges  is  excluded  from  the  EIRR  analysis.  There  were \ndifficulties in measuring the effects of loss of access disruption to residents because of the \nproject.  However,  allowance  has  been  made  for  the  costs  of  the  temporary  relocation  of \nhawkers and vendors. \n \n25.  Water Supply Improvements. It is projected that the percentage of unaccounted for \nwater (UFW) will decline to 32% upon the completion of the Project and continue to decline to \n15% by 2021, by reducing wastage at stand posts and transmission and distribution leaks, and \nby practicing greater operational efficiency at treatment plants. This will lead to substantial \nincrease in the volume of additional water supplies to households. To show the impact of the \nProject, it is assumed in the without-project scenario that the percentage of UFW is currently \n60% and will gradually deteriorate to 70% by 2021, mainly because of an unchanged number of \nstandpipe users and more leaks during the transmission and distribution. Three major streams \nof economic benefits of the water supply component are identified: (i) production and supply \nefficiencies, (ii) increased access to piped water, and (iii) a greater volume of accessible piped \nwater. \n \n26.  Environment and Sanitation Improvements. Improvements in sewerage, sanitation, \nstorm drainage, and solid waste management will improve the environment, living conditions,  \nand public health. However, it is hard to establish how much each investment activity will \ncontribute to these impacts. The environment and sanitation improvement components will have \ntwo major economic benefits: (i) the value of residential property will increase as a result of \nbetter  amenities,  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  coping  with  inadequate  sewerage,  sanitation,  storm \ndrainage and solid waste management will be avoided. \n \n27.  Road  and  Transportation  Improvements.  Improving  roads  and  constructing  bus \nterminals  will  be  improve  accessibility  and  reduce  traffic  congestion.  The  road  and \ntransportation  improvement  components  will  have  two  major  economic  benefits: (i)  vehicle \nowners will save on vehicle operating costs, and (ii) travelers will save on travel time.  \n \nTable A10.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis \nAll \nItem  Thiruvananthapuram Kollam  Kochi  Kozhikode  Thrissur\nCities \nWater Supply             \nNPV (Rs million)  \u2014  194  418  \u2014  292  904 \nEIRR (%)  \u2014  19  25  \u2014  20  21 \nSensitivity Test  \u2014      \u2014     \nCapital cost overrun (%)  \u2014  17  23  \u2014  19  20 \nSwitching value (%)  \u2014  62  134  \u2014  84  92 \nLower time valuation (%)  \u2014  16  21  \u2014  18  18 \nSwitching value (%)  \u2014  (40)  (54)  \u2014  (46)  (48) \nLower willingness to pay (%)  \u2014  17  24  \u2014  20  20 \nSwitching value (%)  \u2014  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \u2014   \u2014  \nLower supply and connection (%)  \u2014  6  9  \u2014  10   8 \nSwitching value (%)  \u2014  (30)  (42)  \u2014  (42)  (38) \n ", "Appendix 10  51 \nAll \nItem  Thiruvananthapuram Kollam  Kochi  Kozhikode  Thrissur\nCities \nEnvironment Improvements             \nNPV (Rs million)  222  392  295  377  388  1673 \nEIRR (%)  18  31  18  27  24  22 \nSensitivity Test             \nCapital cost overrun (%)  17  24  14  24  18  18 \nSwitching value (%)  37  85  33  142  56  57 \nReduced benefits (%)  12  21  11  20  16  15 \nSwitching value (%)  (19)  (36)  (19)  (42)  (26)  (27) \nReduced beneficiaries (%)  negative  6% negative  7%  negative  negative \nSwitching value (%)  (19)  (36)  (19)  (42)  (26)  (27) \nRoad and Transport             \nNPV (Rs million)  735  504  592  55  172  2,057 \nEIRR (%)  47  57  42  15  20  34 \nSensitivity Test             \nCapital cost overrun (%)  43  52  39  14  19  32 \nSwitching value (%)  395  522  338  28  82  239 \nNo road surface (%)  42  39  37  13  25  31 \nSwitching value (%)  (u/e)  (u/e)  (u/e)  (30)  (93)  (u/e) \nLower reduction in travel time (%)  39  45  33  11  14  27 \nSwitching value (%)  (u/e)  (u/e)  (u/e)  (39)  (65)  (u/e) \nReduced beneficiaries (%)  25  30  22  5  9  18 \nSwitching value (%)  (75)  (79)  (70)  (17)  (38)  (64) \n\u2014 = not available, NPV = net present value, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, u/e = unable to estimate. \nSource:  Economic  Analysis  Report,  TA  4106-IND  (ADB.  2003.

The \nEIRR for each sector will be from 19% to 35%.  The EIRR for each city will be from 14% to 40%. \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of the economic results to changes in \nproject parameters, assumptions, and outputs. The results indicate that EIRRs in all sectors are \nmost sensitive to the number of beneficiaries.

Financial projections for Kerala Water Authority (KWA) in three service areas and the \nfive  municipal  corporations  have  been  prepared,  on  the  basis  of  projected  receipts  and \nexpenditures in Indian rupees. The projections were based on the new tariff schedule and tax \nrates adopted by KWA and municipal corporations, and new expenditure patterns resulting from \nnew investment and rehabilitation by the Project \n \n2.  Cost Recovery. According to the Government of Kerala (GoK), it would not be socially \nor politically feasible to pursue full cost recovery, which would require a steep increase in tariffs. \nFor the water supply, GoK expressed a preference for a new water tariff that was just enough to \ncover  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  new \ninvestments. For sewerage services, GoK favored a sewerage tariff that was sufficient to cover \nthe O&M costs of new infrastructure. If the tariff was based on full cost recovery, households \nwould  spend  more  every  month  on  sewerage  than  on  water,  because  of  the  high  capital \ninvestment. For solid waste management, as the sizes of investment and O&M costs are \nrelatively small, the new tariff will cover capital investment and O&M costs. \n \n3.  KWA Finance. The projected revenue receipts in the three KWA service areas assume \nthat (i) non-revenue water will be reduced from 60% of the total to 30% by the end of the project \nimplementation,1 (ii) per capita per day water consumption will be increased to government \nstandards,2 (iii) tariff collection efficiency will be increased from 30% to 80% by the end of the \nproject  implementation,  and  (iv)  the  tariff  will  be  increased  twice  during  the  project \nimplementation period to a level which is sufficient to cover the O&M costs of new and existing \ninfrastructure. It is assumed that the current connection fee will remain the same to make it \naffordable and to encourage households to connect. \n \n4.  For the projection of revenue expenditure, projected salaries, establishment costs, and \nO&M costs of the existing water supply system are based on actual financial data. The O&M \ncosts for the new investments are based on engineering estimates, taking into account the \ngreater  water  supply  and  the  number  of  people  served.  Both  existing  and  new  costs  are \nassumed to increase by the inflation rate of 6% over the forecast period. \n \n5.  Municipal Corporation Finance. The revenue projections assume that (i) municipal \ncorporations will increase property tax rates and coverage, and implement new user charges \nwhich are set at a level sufficient to cover the O&M costs of new infrastructure, (ii) collection \nefficiency of property tax and new user charges will be raised from an average of 75% to 85% \nby the end of project implementation and will be sustained, (iii) there will be a 6% annual \nincrease in non-tax receipts and assigned tax, and 2% in grant-in-aid from GoK, and (iv) GoK \nwill provide grants to municipal corporations so they can repay the principal and debt service in \neach year after the grace period. For the revenue from water supply in Thrissur municipal \ncorporation, the same assumptions are made as for revenue receipts of KWA finance. \n \n6.  The expenditure projections are based on salaries, establishment costs, O&M costs of \nexisting municipal services and facilities. The incremental O&M costs for the new investment \nare based on engineering estimates and the number of population served. Both existing and \n                                                 \n2  Central Public Health Environmental Engineering Organization (CPHEEO) provides  per capita  water supply \nstandards of 135 litters per capita per day (lpcd) for areas covered by sewage networks, and of 70 lpcd for other \nareas. For the industrialized and commercial areas, 200 lpcd is used to make allowance for greater consumption. \n ", "Appendix 12  55 \nnew costs are assumed to increase by the estimated inflation rate of 6% over the forecast \nperiod. \n \nB.   Analysis of Financial Viability and Sustainability \n \n7.  Based on these assumptions, the financial viability and sustainability of a Project is \nassessed by comparing the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the proposed projects in 25 \nyears with the financial opportunity cost of capital (FOCC). As a proxy for the FOCC, the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the Project in real terms is used (Table A12.1). \nFIRR is the discount rate that equalizes the present values of costs and revenues over the \nproject life while the WACC of 4% represents the estimated cost incurred by the municipal \ncorporations  to  implement  the  subprojects.  All  revenues  and  costs  are  calculated  on  an \nincremental basis, reflecting the difference between \u2018with\u2019 and \u2018without\u2019 project scenarios. \n \nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nItems  Grant  Equity  Total \n(%)  (%)  (%) \nNominal cost  70.0  30.0  100.0 \nTax rate  0.0  10.0   \nTax adjusted nominal cost  0.0  0.0   \nInflation rate  6.0  6.0   \nReal cost  0.0  3.8   \nMinimum test  4.0  4.0   \nWeighted component of WACC  2.8  1.2  4.0 \nWeighted average cost of capital      4.0 \nSource: TA 4106-IND (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Kerala \nSustainable Urban Development Project.  Manila). \n \n8.  FIRR is calculated for each of the revenue-generating Projects. The results in Table \nA12.2 indicate that the water supply and solid waste management projects are financially viable, \nhave FIRRs higher than the WACC, and are sustainable with positive financial net present \nvalue. The sewerage projects, however, have negative FIRRs because of high investment costs \nand social and political constraints on setting sewerage user charges higher than the water \nexpenditure of a household. \n \nTable A12.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return by Sectors and Municipal Corporations  \nItem  Thiruvananthapuram  Kollam  Kochi  Kozhikode  Thrissur \nWater Supply           \nNPV (Rs in million)  \u2014  93.7  835.6  \u2014  158.9 \nFIRR  \u2014  8.7  12.9  \u2014  5.9 \nSensitivity Analysis           \nCapital costs overrun  \u2014  7.8  11.9  \u2014  5.1 \nO&M costs increase  \u2014  8.5  12.7  \u2014  5.7 \nDecreased revenues growth  \u2014  7.5  11.6  \u2014  4.8 \nDelay in benefits  \u2014  7.6  11.4  \u2014  5.0 \nHigher non-revenue water  \u2014  7.7  12.0  \u2014  4.7 \nLower water demand  \u2014  7.2  9.4  \u2014  4.2 \nLower tariff increase  \u2014  1.5  4.6  \u2014  negative \nSewerage and Sanitation           \nNPV (Rs in million)  (924.7)  (540.7)  (997.9)  (616.3)  13.9 \nFIRR  (6.4)  (13.4)  (14.8)  (5.6)  13.1 \nSensitivity Analysis           \nCapital costs overrun  (6.8)  (13.9)  (15.5)  (6.0)  10.8 \nO&M costs increase  (7.1)  (16.5)  (19.4)  (6.4)  10.2 \nDecreased revenues growth  (7.6)  (17.5)  (21.2)  (6.9)  7.6 \nDelay in benefits  (7.5)  (14.4)  (18.1)  (6.8)  8.1 \nSolid Waste Management           \nNPV (Rs in million)  \u2014  32.1  24.8  35.9  142.1 \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \nItem  Thiruvananthapuram  Kollam  Kochi  Kozhikode  Thrissur \nFIRR  \u2014  6.9%  5.2%  7.1%  18.1% \nSensitivity Analysis           \nCapital costs overrun  \u2014  5.6  4.0  5.7  16.0 \nO&M costs increase  \u2014  5.5  3.7  5.6  16.8 \nDecreased revenues growth  \u2014  4.0  2.4  4.0  14.5 \nDelay in benefits  \u2014  4.9  3.5  5.0  13.6 \n\u2014 = not available as no project is implemented, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: TA 4106-IND (ADB. 2003.

Sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out  to  determine  the  possible  effects  of  adverse \nchanges on the subprojects. The adverse changes were (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, \n(ii)) a 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-year delay in \nbenefits.  For  water  supply  subprojects,  additional  sensitivity  analyses  we)re  done  for  the \nfollowing adverse conditions: (i) NRW assumption higher by 10%, (ii) water demand assumption \nlower by 10%, and (iii) tariff increase assumption lower by 50%. The results in Table A12.2 \nindicate that the financial viability of the proposed projects is most sensitive to the extent of the \ntariff increase. In other words, implementation of the tariff increases is vital for the expected \nfinancial return. \n \nC.   Analysis of Fair Pricing and Distributive Justice  \n \n10.  Average Incremental Financial Cost. The appropriate tariff level for full cost recovery \nis  the  long-run  marginal  cost  (LMC)  of  urban  service  delivery,  which  includes  incremental \ninvestment and O&M costs. Assuming that urban services are provided at minimum cost in the \nlong run and hence that the LMC equates to the long-run average cost, the average incremental \nfinancial cost (AIFC) is regarded as an approximation of the LMC. The average incremental \nfinancial cost (AIFC) for each subproject is calculated by dividing the present value of the \nincremental subproject cost streams by the present value of the incremental quantity streams. \nThe costs and quantity streams were both discounted at the WACC of 4%. Table A12.3 shows \nthat  the  average  tariffs  for  water  supply,  on-site  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management \ncomponents will fully cover their incremental investments and O&M costs, as their average \ntariffs are higher than their respective AIFCs. \n \nTable A12.3: Average Incremental Financial Cost and Average Tariff \nItem  Thiruvananthapuram  Kollam  Kochi  Kozhikode Thrissur \nWater Supply (Rs per kiloliter)           \nAIFC of capital investment and O&M  \u2014  3.5  2.3  \u2014  6.6 \nAverage Tariff  \u2014  5.3  5.1  \u2014  7.8 \nSewerage and Sanitation (Rs per kiloliter)           \nAIFC of capital investment and O&M  13.2  9.7  11.7  7.6     481.8a \nAIFC of O&M  3.21  3.1  3.8  3.2  \u2014 \nAverage Tariff  3.21  3.2  3.8  3.2     623.2a \nSolid Waste (Rs per metric ton)           \nAIFC of capital investment and O&M  \u2014     986.1  1,123.7  907.3     819.6 \nAverage Tariff  \u2014  1,094.1  1,175.0  1,007.9  1,294.9 \nAIFC = average incremental financial cost, O&M = operation and maintenance, \u2014 = not available. \na  Figure represents rupees per septic tank under on-site sanitation scheme. \nSource: TA 4106-IND (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development \nProject. Manila). \n \n \n11.  The sewerage component, however, cannot recover its full cost through the tariff, and \nrequires a subsidy of Rs4 to Rs8 for every kiloliter of sewage. Despite the difficulty in achieving \nfull cost recovery for sewerage services, a comparison between the average tariff and the AIFC \n ", "Appendix 12  57 \nof O&M reveals that the proposed tariff level is just sufficient to cover the incremental O&M \ncosts. In other words, a subsidy is needed to cover the new capital investment. In the light of \nurgent  needs  for  improvement  in  environmental  sanitation,  the  municipal  corporations  are \nfinancially committed to improving sewerage provision by subsidizing the sector, despite the \nunfavorable FIRR and insufficient levels of tariff to cover full incremental costs. \n \n12.  Affordability.  In  order  to  distribute  urban  services  fairly,  the  new  tariffs  for  water, \nsewerage and solid waste management were assessed for each socioeconomic group. The \nproportion of the monthly household expenses spent on urban services each month is estimated \nfor each socio-economic category. The results indicate that people above the poverty line are \nlikely to be able to afford the new user charges, which will represent less than 5% of their \nhousehold income. \n \n13.  On the other hand, the impact of the new user charges on people living below the \npoverty line varies from one municipal corporation to another, and the charges represent from \n2% to 7% of their household incomes. However, the figures are only for analytical purposes and \ndo not reflect reality. Those below poverty line are likely to rely on street taps for the day-to-day \nsource of water, which are, and will continue to be in a scaled down version, provided free to the \npublic. Without any expenditure for water, the expenditure of the poor on improved urban \nservices is less than 5% of household income. \n \n14.  Subsistence. Expenditure on water was estimated, based on projected consumption \nper household in 2010. A poor household will consume 8 to 13 kiloliters per month, depending \non the city corporation. The daily per capita equivalent will be between 90 and 108 liters, which \nfalls in the per capita water supply standard for the areas with sewerage and without sewerage. \ndefined by the Central Public Health Environmental Engineering Organization (CPHEEO).   \n \nD.  Assessment of Project Sustainability \n \n15.  Financial projections for each city corporation show that revenue enhancement and new \ncost recovery measures will ensure the proposed projects are sustainable. Since GOK will \nprovide grants to municipal corporations, which will cover all repayment of principal and debt \nservicing to GOK each year. In other words, although municipal corporations will be legally \nobliged to repay and service their debt, they will not have to use their own financial resources. In \nlong run, municipal corporations will be required to finance only O&M. In the water supply, \nsewerage management, and solid waste management sectors, O&M costs will be covered by \nrevenues from user charges and/or other recourse mobilization measures, and, therefore, the \nProject should not have a financial impact on the municipal corporations\u2019 annual budgets. \n \n16.  The road and drainage sectors, however, will require continuing financing for O&M from \nthe municipal corporations, as there is no scope for cost recovery and the sectors benefit the \ngeneral public. The finances of the municipal corporations between FY2012 and FY2017 were \nprojected, assuming that revenue and expenditure will grow in line with inflation rates, i.e., 6% \nannually. The result indicates that the revenue surplus will be enough to cover the cost of O&M; \ntherefore, the urban infrastructure developed under the Project will be sustainable. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nPOLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL ACTION PLAN \n \nObjectives  GoK Actions  KSUDP Actions  Responsible \n  Agencies / Time \n  frames \nA.
