I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Second Vocational Education \nand Skills Development Project.1 \n2.  The project seeks to improve the quality and relevance of, and equitable access to and \neffectiveness of, the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system in the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  Quality  and  relevance  of  the  TVET  system  will  be  improved  through \nmodernization of the training methodology, teaching and learning environments, and training \ndelivery. Equitable access will be improved through the introduction of an innovative skills \ndevelopment fund to provide training in response to urgent labor market needs, and for targeting \nspecific geographic areas or specific groups to provide them with employable skills, such as out-\nof-school youths, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. The project also includes support to rural \nprimary  vocational  schools  outside  of  Bishkek  and  Osh,  and  better  access  for  physically \ndisabled students and for women. The effectiveness of the TVET system will be improved by \nstrengthening TVET governance and management nationally and within the schools. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  recently  approved  its  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Program,  2012\u20132014,  aiming  for  an  average  growth  rate  of  6%  per  annum \nanchored on the robust expansion of seven priority sectors2 that are expected to drive the \neconomy and create jobs for the growing number of unemployed, particularly among youths (in \n2010, 17.1% of female youths and 12.2% of male youths were unemployed). However, many \nenterprises experience difficulties in finding skilled workers, underscoring the mismatch between \nthe outputs of the education and training sector and labor market needs. This shortage of skilled \nlabor is a binding constraint on economic growth. \n4.  The project will help remove this constraint by supporting the modernization of the TVET \nsystem in rural and urban areas. It will focus on the seven priority sectors (footnote 2) and \ninvolve employers in selecting the key occupations and determining the skills required for these \noccupations. It will help meet the needs of the labor market. \n5.  The TVET system is composed of primary TVET, designed to develop skilled workers \nand craftsmen, and secondary TVET, designed to develop technicians and middle-level staff. \nThe enrollment size in the TVET system is small, resulting in significant underutilization of \nexisting capacity. Other key issues include the lack of quality and relevance of the TVET system \ndue  to  outdated  curriculum  structure  and  contents,  aging  teachers  and  outdated  training, \ninadequate and obsolete equipment, weak institutional management, insufficient funding, and \nweak links with industry. In addition, there is limited coordination between the different types of \nTVET providers and between managing organizations in terms of planning and programs, which \ncontributes to a fragmented TVET system. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The seven priority sectors (construction, mining, energy, tourism, textiles and garment, land transport, and \nagriculture/agro-processing) jointly constitute 54% of gross domestic product and 63% of formal employment. ", "2 \n6.  The project will build on the achievements under the first Vocational Education and Skills \nDevelopment Project (VESDP), which is supporting reforms to the primary TVET system.3 A key \nachievement  under  VESDP  is  the  introduction  of  the  competency-based  training  (CBT) \nmethodology  in  25  assisted  vocational  schools for  18  priority occupations,4 along  with  the \nimprovement of the teaching and learning environment. The VESDP successfully introduced the \nfull cycle of the CBT methodology.5 In May 2012, training for the pilot occupation \u201cseamstress\u201d \nwas completed in 9 vocational schools with a total of 211 trainees, of which 185 were assessed \nand 174 passed the independent assessment conducted by accredited competency assessors \nfrom the textile and garment industry. The industry hired 85% of the graduates immediately. The \ninitial offering of modular CBT courses for all 18 occupations in 25 vocational schools started in \nJuly 2012, after installation and training on the use of the new training equipment. In addition, \nthe  VESDP  supported  the  first  step  in  the  rationalization  of  the  primary  TVET  system, \nconsolidating 32 of 110 vocational schools in urban areas into 25 regional resource centers, \nfocusing on the development of skills needed by local industries and overseas markets. It also \nsupported the rehabilitation of these regional resource centers and the provision of new training \nequipment in 158 workshops. \n7.  The project will build on these achievements, and the strong foundation established in \ndelivering demand-driven and relevant training programs. Support will expand to primary TVET \nin rural areas and include secondary TVET, training middle-level skilled labor for the seven \npriority  sectors,  including  information  communication  technology  as  a  cross-cutting  priority \namongst these sectors. The project will sustain momentum among the assisted  vocational \nschools toward greater financial autonomy and sustainability by increasing their capacity to \ngenerate non-state-budget revenues, particularly through training fees. \n8.  The project will complement the ongoing Investment Climate Improvement Program of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB),6 which includes policy actions to leverage TVET reforms. \nOn  26  March  2012,  the  Decree  on  the  National  Professional  Skills  Development  Council \n(NPSDC) was approved under subprogram 2 of the Investment Climate Improvement Program. \nNPSDC provides a framework for policymakers, employers, and key stakeholders to ensure that \nskills development efforts in the country are coordinated and responsive to labor market needs. \nThe Agency for Vocational Education (AVE) in the Ministry of Youth, Labor, and Employment \nserves as NPSDC Secretariat. \n9.  The  project  is  consistent  with  national  priorities  (para.  3)  and  with  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy.7 Lessons learned from the VESDP will be acted on, including the need to mainstream \n                                                \n3  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendations  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Vocational Education and Skills Development Project. \nManila ($10 million, closing on 31 December 2012). \n4  The 18 priority occupations chosen in collaboration with industry are: (i) electric and gas welder; (ii) electrician \n(electric  equipment);  (iii)  electrician  (household  equipment);  (iv)  electrician  (power  stations  and  network \nmaintenance);  (v)  motor  mechanic;  (vi)  plumber;  (vii)  plasterer,  paver;  (viii)  master  gypsum  plasterboard \nconstruction; (ix) master finisher; (x) joiner\u2013carpenter; (xi) junior veterinary assistant; (xii) farmer; (xiii) operator of \nagricultural  products  processing;  (xiv)  hotel  industry  worker;  (xv)  cook;  (xvi)  tailor;  (xvii)  cutter;  and \n(xviii) hairdresser. Women dominate the last five occupations.  \n5  The  full cycle  of  CBT  methodology  consists  of  (i)  industry  experts  developing  internationally  benchmarked \ncompetency standards and assessment tools, (ii) trained teachers developing modular CBT curriculum and training \nmaterials,  (iii)  training  of  teachers  to  deliver  CBT  modules,  (iv)  training  and  accreditation  of  independent \ncompetency assessors from among industry experts, and (v) competency assessments by accredited assessors. \n6  ADB.  2008.

The project is included in the draft country \noperations business plan 2012-2013 (scheduled for approval in October 2012). ", "  3 \nproject activities into AVE, to introduce competitive selection to support teaching and learning \nenvironments,  and  to  factor  in  the  characteristics  of  internal  and  external  migration  when \ndeveloping TVET interventions. Under the project, ADB will work closely with other donors \nunder the Education Sector-Wide Approach Program,8 and serve as the lead agency for TVET \nreform. \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  inclusive  growth  through  greater  employment \nopportunities  for  TVET  graduates.  The  outcome  will  be  stronger  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency of and more equitable access to TVET. The project has four outputs; (i) primary TVET \nsystem  rationalized  and  TVET  system  modernized;  (ii)  TVET  teaching  and  learning \nenvironments  improved;  (iii)  curriculum,  and  teaching  and  learning  materials  for  TVET \ndeveloped; and (iv) quality of TVET delivery strengthened. \n1.  Primary TVET System Rationalized and TVET System Modernized \n11.  The project will support the finalization of the primary TVET rationalization strategy \nbased on a school-mapping exercise. The rationalization strategy will be implemented under the \nproject. The project will support the modernization of the TVET system by making it more \nresponsive  to  labor  market  needs.  The  newly  established  NPSDC  will  be  supported  by \nstrengthening  AVE  as  its  secretariat  and  by  establishing  sector  councils  that  represent \nemployers in the seven priority sectors. School advisory boards will be strengthened in both \nprimary and secondary vocational schools to help institutionalize engagement with the private \nsector in policy formulation and help foster the entrepreneurial spirit of school management. The \nproject  will  support  further  development  and  institutionalization  of  the  school  management \nsystem for primary vocational schools, and the publication of an annual TVET Statistical Bulletin \nand an annual tracer study of graduates. These publications will provide an analysis on the \nskills mismatches in the economy and on the disparities in employment opportunities between \nmale\u2013female and urban\u2013rural graduates. A skills development fund will be set up to provide a \ndemand-driven funding mechanism. Training needs will be identified, packaged, and awarded to \ntraining providers through open tender. The project will also support gender-sensitive social \nmarketing campaigns intended to increase enrollment and improve the image of TVET as a \nviable educational provider for a future career. All incoming and graduating students will receive \ngender-sensitive career guidance materials. \n2.  TVET Teaching and Learning Environments Improved \n12.  The improvement of teaching and learning environments will include minor civil works9 \nfor rehabilitation of workshops, computer classrooms, and dormitories in vocational schools, and \nthe  procurement  of  training  equipment,  furniture  and  consumables  required  for  the  newly \ndeveloped learning materials using the CBT methodology. Support to vocational schools will be \nprovided on a competitive basis. It is envisioned that 70% of the support to primary vocational \nschools will go to areas outside Bishkek and Osh. This share will be decided based on the \nschool-mapping results. \n \n                                                \n8  The Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), European Union delegation, the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. \n9  Rehabilitation works include the provision of facilities to improve access for disabled students. \n ", "4 \n3.  Curriculum, Teaching and Learning Materials for TVET Developed \n13.  The project will support the expansion of the CBT methodology in terms of the number of \ninstitutions and number of occupations, and institutionalize its adoption in the TVET system. \nBased on sector maps for the seven priority sectors (footnote 2), 45 priority occupations will be \nspecified in close coordination with the private sector, and learning materials using the CBT \nmethodology will be developed both in printed and electronic versions. The project will help \ninstitutionalize  TVET  reforms  through  the  development  of  national  systems  for  (i)  national \ncompetency standards and assessment tools, (ii) CBT curriculum and learning materials, and \n(iii) competency assessment and certification, to be adopted by AVE after review by NPSDC. \n4.  Quality of TVET Delivery Strengthened \n14.  Strengthening TVET delivery will support teacher capacity building. A TVET teaching \nqualification framework will be developed, establishing minimum requirements for teachers. \nBased  on  a  TVET  teachers'  development  program,  teachers  will  receive  national  and \ninternational training. The former Retraining Center under AVE will be upgraded to a Resource \nCenter and will function as the training arm for continuing staff development of teachers and \nmanagement of the TVET system. It will also undertake research on new training approaches \nand  methodologies  and  help  develop  learning  materials  for  different  TVET  programs.  In \naddition, it will serve as venue for meetings of the sector councils. \nC.  Investment and Financing Plans \n15.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  AVE will be the executing agency of the project. AVE will appoint the project director \nwho will coordinate the overall implementation of project activities. NPSDC will serve as the \nproject steering committee and provide strategic guidance and monitor project implementation. \nNPSDC is chaired by the vice prime minister (social affairs) and consists of representatives from \nthe government, employers, and employees. The project steering committee will meet quarterly, \nor as often as required. \n \n19.  The project will be implemented through a project implementation unit (PIU), headed by \na  project manager  who  will  be  responsible for  overall  implementation.  A  secondary TVET \nspecialist at the PIU will serve as a liaison officer with the Professional Education Department in \nthe Ministry of Education and Science, and the secondary vocational schools, and will facilitate \nsecondary TVET support activities that start from the second year. AVE will provide office space \nfor the PIU. The PIU will report to the project director and submit quarterly progress reports to \nthe project steering committee, AVE, and ADB. Project consultants supporting AVE and the \nResource Center\u2019s activities will be housed in their respective offices, and AVE staff will be \nassigned as counterparts to ensure knowledge transfer. \n \n20.  Staffing at AVE and the Resource Center will be realigned following the endorsement of \nthe revised organizational structure of both organizations by the Ministry of Youth, Labor, and \nEmployment. Following realignment, the project will support a capacity assessment and provide \ntraining to fill capacity gaps. Staff of AVE and the Resource Center will receive additional \ncompensation for fulfillment of specific tasks in accordance with the Kyrgyz Republic legislation \nto attract and retain qualified professionals. \n \n                                                \n10 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Kyrgyz Republic had a \nmoderate risk of debt distress and was eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n ", "6 \n21.

", "  7 \n \n22.  To retain momentum and reduce the time for consultant recruitment, AVE will initiate the \nrecruitment of the international consulting firm upon endorsement of the project procurement \nplan for recruiting consultants by ADB. The contract should not be signed until the project \nbecomes effective. Project PIU staff will be recruited through advanced contracting to allow a \nsmooth transition between the ongoing and proposed projects. PIU staff of the ongoing project \ncan apply for new PIU positions. PIU positions will be advertised upon approval of the project by \nthe ADB Board of Directors. The new PIU will start its assignment upon project effectiveness. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  Sector maps for the seven priority sectors (footnote 2) were prepared to identify new \npriority occupations to be supported under the project. An occupational mapping exercise and \nsurvey was conducted to establish a comprehensive list of technical occupations in each of the \nseven sectors. Under the survey, employers working in priority sectors were asked to select the \nmost critical occupations and skills needed for their operations, number of skilled workers \nrequired, difficulty in filling vacancies, and length of time needed to train new hires before they \nbecome  productive. This  list  of occupations  and  skills  was  then  discussed  with groups of \nexperts from each sector during focus group discussions to determine the priority level of each \noccupation and related skills. The experts established a list of 78 priority occupations. As the \nproject will not be able to support all priority occupations, sector councils under NPSDC will be \nrequested to select the 45 most critical occupations and skills. This activity will be supported by \nthe PIU as part of project preparations. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The direct economic benefits from the project are derived mainly from greater access to \nshort-term  and  long-term  skills  training,  better  domestic  and  overseas  employment \nopportunities, and higher labor market outcomes for TVET graduates thanks to more relevant \nskills  training.  The  project  will  support  skills  development,  producing  graduates  with  the \ntechnical skills required by the seven priority sectors, and expanding their income-generating \nactivities.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  20.8%.  The \ngovernment\u2019s contribution to the project is included in the budget and estimated at $19 million \n(Som984 million) for the primary TVET system and at $4.4 million (Som205 million) for the \nsecondary  TVET  system.  Project  activities  should  be  sustainable,  taking  into  account  the \nanticipated increased proceeds through income-generating activities from vocational schools, \nwhich are expected to increase from 10% to 25% of total revenue, and efficiency improvements \nof the primary TVET system through rationalization. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Project-specific  governance  risks  have  been  analyzed  by  carrying  out  financial \nmanagement and procurement capacity assessments of AVE and the PIU. The result of the \nfinancial management assessment shows that AVE has the capacity to record its financial \ntransactions  and  balances,  and  to  provide  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and \nmonitoring reports to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with government regulations. The \nPIU financial management system satisfies the financial management requirements of ADB. \nSince AVE is complying with government accounting regulations, which are different from ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management requirements, the project\u2019s financial management will not be integrated in \n ", "8 \nAVE, but will remain with the PIU. In the PIU, the accounting function will remain separate from \nthe  cashier  function,  to  allow  for  internal  control.  Based  on  the  procurement  capacity \nassessment, the following recommendations are made to mitigate procurement risks: (i) provide \nconsulting inputs to the PIU to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and services; \n(ii) the person signing the contracts should not be part of the bid evaluation committee; and \n(iii) at least one member of the bid evaluation committee should be certified in procurement, \neither by the former State Agency for Procurement or the Procurement Unit in the Ministry of \nFinance. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and AVE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The close link between educational development and reduction in poverty incidence, \nproductivity gain, economic growth, and the improvement of general living conditions is well \nestablished. In the case of TVET, access to quality training will expand the income-generating \nopportunities of the graduates. About 125,000 students, of which at least 30% are targeted to be \nfemale, will benefit from the long-term skills training, and approximately 145,000 adults and out-\nof-school youths, of which at least 30% are targeted to be female, will benefit from short-term \nskills training courses during the project. New demand-driven curriculum modules, rehabilitated \nand upgraded training workshops, and practice-oriented training programs will improve income-\nearning opportunities after graduation. In addition, an estimated 15,000 disadvantaged youths \nand adults, of which at least 30% are targeted to be female, will be trained under the skills \ndevelopment fund. Considering that more than 50% of youths and adults participating in training \nprograms are from low-income families, the project will contribute to the enhancement of income \nopportunities for the poor. Vocational schools will benefit from increased training income, which \nwill enable them to supplement the state budget, and to pay for training consumables and \nadditional income for teachers. Local enterprises will benefit through increased productivity \nbecause of a better-skilled workforce, which in turn will contribute to the country\u2019s economic \ncompetitiveness and growth. \n \n28.  The project includes a gender action plan to improve gender responsiveness. Sex-\ndisaggregated data will be collected on both primary and secondary TVET. Research activities \nunder the project will include a separate analysis to study and report on the disparities in job \nopportunities between male and female graduates. Gender-sensitive career guidance materials \nand social marketing campaigns will be supported. At least 30% of the rehabilitated dormitories \nwill be allocated to female students. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  No  land  acquisition  will  be  required,  and  there  are  no  negative  environmental  or \nresettlement impacts, since the project will carry out only minor rehabilitation and repairs of \nexisting school buildings and facilities. Some school rehabilitation works will improve water \nsupply  and  sanitation, which  will  promote good  health.  Any  activities  that  may  cause  any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be  eligible for  project financing. No  impacts from \nproject activities are expected on the ethnic minorities in the country. \n ", "  9 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSustainability of NPSDC  The key strategy to mitigate this risk is to ensure that NPSDC, a \nthreatened in case of change in  high-level multisector body, can show performance through \npolitical leadership  endorsement and approval of well-crafted policies, plans, and \nprograms on skills development. The project will support the \nsecretariat of NPSDC and the sector councils, which represent \nemployers in the seven priority sectors, in preparing these \npolicies, plans, and programs for NPSDC approval. \n \nLimited capacity of AVE as NPSDC  The project will mitigate this risk by the ongoing review of AVE\u2019s \nSecretariat  organizational structure and staffing to ensure that activities \ninitiated under the project are mainstreamed into its regular \nfunctions. The competencies of AVE staff will be assessed, and \ntraining will be provided to fill gaps. \n \nEmployers to partner slower than  The strategy to mitigate this risk is to institutionalize the \nexpected with government  participation of employers in TVET, rather than doing it on an ad \nhoc basis, a lesson learned from the positive response of those \ninvolved in ADB\u2019s first Vocational Education and Skills \nDevelopment Project.a This includes establishing mechanisms \nwhere employers can participate in policy formulation nationally \n(NPSDC and sector councils), on operational matters in the \nschools (school advisory board), and in project-specific activities \n(e.g., MOUs with particular schools). \n \nAdaptation to reforms by school  The strategy to mitigate this risk is to manage the change \nmanagement and staff slower than  process through (i) thorough orientation to ensure the school \nexpected due to limited absorptive  management understands why changes are needed and the \ncapacity  benefits that will accrue from them; and (ii) intensive training that \nprovides them with knowledge and skills to be able to cope with \nthe changes. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AVE  =  Agency  for  Vocational  Education,  MOU  =  memorandum  of \nunderstanding, NPSDC = National Professional Skills Development Council, TVET = technical and vocational \neducation and training. \na ADB.  2007.
