The \n\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Transport and communication \nSubsector: Roads and highways \nTheme: Economic growth \nSubtheme: Fostering physical infrastructure development \n \nCategory B \nAn \nsummary is attached as an appendix. \n \nThe Project is to (i) reconstruct and improve the Andkhoy-Qaisar \nsection  (210  kilometers)  of  the  national  primary  ring  road,  (ii) \ninstall toll facilities including toll plazas and weighing machines for \nnewly  improved  primary  roads  in  Afghanistan,  and  (iii)  provide \nproject  management  support  to  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works \n(MPW).  \n \nMuch  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  infrastructure  has  been  destroyed  or \ndamaged  in  more  than  two  decades  of  conflict.  Damaged  roads \nbecame  bottlenecks  to  the  movement  of  people  and  goods. \nthe  division  and \nRestricted  movement  has  aggravated \ndisintegration of the country, as travel time and vehicle operating \ncost on roads significantly increased. The result is a virtual loss of \nefficient means of transport connecting Kabul to regional centers, \nand regional centers to remote villages. \n \nThe  Andkhoy-Qaisar  road  forms  part  of  the  Herat-Andkhoy  road, \nwhich is the last unpaved section of the national primary ring road. \nThe project area is one of the least developed areas that the ring \nroad  touches.  Due  to  its  remoteness  and  extreme  weather  in \nwinter  and  summer,  the  project  area  is  still  in  need  of  continued \nhumanitarian  aid  and  assistance \nin  basic  social  services. \nImprovement to the road will facilitate provision of such services.  \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  coordinated  international  assistance  to \nimprove the road connecting Herat to Andkhoy, which will become \na  major  north-south  link  across  the  central  mountains,  and \nsignificantly  improve  the  stability  and  reliability  of  the  transport \nsystem  in  Afghanistan.  The  improved  road  will  also  change \ntransport  in  the  subregion.  Together  with  the  international  links \ncurrently being improved to the Central Asian republics, Iran, and \nPakistan,  the  road  will  form  a  major  road  transport  corridor  from \nCentral Asia to the warm water ports in the south. This will reduce \ntransport  costs,  and  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction in the subregion.  \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote \neconomic  and  social  development  through  continued  support  to \nthe Government in reestablishing the primary road network.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80  million,  inclusive  of \ncontingencies and the interest during the 10-year grace period.  \n \nADB will finance 100% of the total project cost.  \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n53,087,000  ($80  million  equivalent)  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe loan  will have a 40-year term including a grace period of 10 \nyears, and an interest rate of 1% per annum. In addition, the total \namount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be \ncapitalized and charged to the loan account. \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \nMPW  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  project  management  unit \nestablished within MPW.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed \nunder  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  with  flexible  interpretation,  wherever \nessential. Civil works will be carried out in two phases: (i) use, on \na  force  account  basis,  of  MPW\u2019s  existing  construction  plant, \nequipment, and labor force for the preliminary works, such as site \nclearance, leveling, grading, and compacting of the existing road; \nand (ii) the remaining works to rehabilitate damaged embankment \nand  provide  asphalt-surfaced  pavement,  bridges,  and  other \nstructures,  packaged  under  civil  works  contracts  to  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding procedures.  \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  to  help  MPW  implement  the \nProject.  They  will  involve  (i)  certification  of  the  force  account \nworks, (ii) supervision of the design-build civil works contracts, (iii) \nsupervision  of  supply  and  installation  of  weighing  machines  and \ntoll equipment, and (iv) project performance monitoring.  \n \nThe consultants to be financed under the Project will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  recruitment  of  domestic \nconsultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method will be used in selecting consultants. \n \n\n\fiv \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\nThe Project will dramatically decrease the vehicle operating costs \nand passenger time on the project road. The primary beneficiaries \nwill  be  the  approximately  800,000  residents  of  the  project  area, \nwho are mostly engaged in agriculture; 50% live below the poverty \nline. They will benefit from improved access to health, education, \nand  other  social  services;  and  increased  prices  of  agricultural \nproducts.  \n \nThe Project, with other funding agencies\u2019 support to improve road \nsections  adjacent  to  the  project  road,  will  improve  access  of \nresidents  in  the  project  area  to  the  two  major  regional  centers, \nHerat  and  Mazar-e-Sharif,  where  higher  levels  of  social  services \nand  a  wider  range  of  economic  opportunities  are  available.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be  19.1%.  The \npoverty impact ratio is estimated to be 0.69. \n \nIncreased  trade  and  transit  through  the  improved  transport \ncorridor  from  Central  Asia  through  Afghanistan  to  Iran  and \nPakistan,  which  includes  the  project  road,  will  benefit  a  broad \nrange of the population, including consumers, manufacturers, and \ntransport  operators  who  will  directly  or  indirectly  use  goods  and \nservices  transported  on  the  project  road.  Increased  trade  and \ntransit will improve the central Government\u2019s financial position by \nincreasing  customs  revenue,  which  accounts  for  40%  of  the \nnational domestic revenue. \n \nThe Project will also contribute to increased social stability as the \nimproved  road  will  provide  the  project  area  with  a  vital  physical \nconnectivity to the rest of the country, and extend the reach of the \ncentral government to the project area.  \n \nThe  risks  to  the  Project  are  related  to  (i)  the  overall  political  and \nsecurity  situation  and  possible  interference  by  the  regional \nwarlords/militia leaders, (ii) trafficking of opium along the improved \nroads,  (iii)  the  Government\u2019s  weak  implementation  capacity,  and \n(iv) timely provision of counterpart resources. \n \nThe  risks  will  be  mitigated  through (i)  continued  close  monitoring \nand  coordination  with  local  and  central  authorities  and  United \nNations agencies to ensure adequate protection, (ii) improvement \nof border procedures to contain movement of opium, (iii) allocation \nof resources under the Project for consulting services to help with \nproject management and implementation, and continued technical \nassistance  to  MPW  through  the  ongoing  technical  assistance \ncluster,  and  (iv)  use  of  the  existing  MPW  project  management \narrangement \nInfrastructure \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Project.  \n\nthe  ongoing  Emergency \n\nfor \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Andkhoy-Qaisar  Road  Project.  The  project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nAfghanistan is a landlocked country. With a large area (about 652,000 square kilometers \n[km2]) and an estimated population of 22.8 million widely spread across the largely mountainous \nterrain, roads are the principal means of transport.1 Its road network comprises about 6,100 km \nof  national  roads  and  15,000  km  of  provincial  roads.  Of  the  national  roads,  3,300  km  are \nnational primary roads including 2,400 km that were originally paved. The national primary road \nnetwork  consists  largely  of  the  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects  Afghanistan\u2019s  major  regional \ncenters  (Herat,  Kandahar,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Maimana,  and  Sheberghan)  with  Kabul,  and  the \nroads linking to neighboring countries.2 The remaining 2,800 km of national roads are secondary \nroads with gravel or earthen surface. The 15,000 km of provincial roads are gravel or earthen \nand comprise 5,400 km of provincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial secondary roads. \nA tertiary road network consists of rural roads3 and substantial lengths of urban roads.4  \n \n3. \nMuch  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  infrastructure  was  destroyed  or  damaged  during  the  more \nthan two decades of conflict. Lack of resources and capacity prevented maintenance, and has \nled  to  major  deterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  The  effects  of  military  actions  are  more \npronounced\u2014damaged  bridges  and  tunnels  have  become  bottlenecks  to  the  movement  of \npeople and goods. Restricted movement has aggravated the division and disintegration of the \ncountry, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads significantly increased.5 \n \n4. \nA comprehensive needs assessment of the Afghanistan transport sector, during March-\nMay  2002  by  major  external  funding  agencies  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nrevealed that 54% of national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, and only 20% in \ngood condition. It urged the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a priority basis.6 \n  \n5. \nAfghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road density \nof 0.03 km per km2 is far lower than that of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, which also have \nlargely  mountainous  terrain  and  similar  population  density,  and  even  lower  than  that  of \nBalochistan  in  Pakistan,  where  population  density  is  about  half  that  of  Afghanistan.7  Even \nwithout  the  damage  inflicted  during  the  conflict  period,  Afghanistan\u2019s  road  network  needs \nsubstantial improvement to provide basic connectivity available elsewhere in the subregion.  \n\n                                                 \n1   With  only  short  lengths  near  the  border  with  Uzbekistan  and  Turkmenistan,  railways  play  a  marginal  role  in \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s transport sector. \n\n2  The international links are to Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n3   Roughly estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 km. \n4   Roughly estimated to be 3,000 km, including 1,060 km in Kabul. \n5   Before  the  conflict,  travel  from  Kabul  to  Kandahar  (1,066  km)  took  less  than  12  hours.  Soon  after  the  conflict,  it \n\ntook about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n\n6   A preliminary needs assessment conducted in December 2001 by ADB, United Nations Development Programme, \nand  World  Bank  was  presented  at  the  ministerial  meeting  in  Tokyo  in  January  2002,  where  external  funding \nagencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance. \n\n7   Road  densities  are  0.18  km/km2  in  Tajikistan,  0.17  km/km2  in  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  0.07  km/km2  in  Balochistan \n\nProvince of Pakistan.  \n\n\f 2\n\nThe Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been responsible for development, operation, \n6. \nand maintenance of the primary and secondary road network in the  country. Its mandate also \ncovers collection of road tolls.8 It had an institutional setup of a large engineering organization9 \nwith  staff  stationed  in  every  major  provincial  capital  and  carrying  out  work  through  force \naccount. Over the course of the conflict, MPW lost a majority of its trained staff. The current staff \nof 2,900 require substantial skills enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n7. \n \nB. \n\nAppendix 2 presents an analysis of the road subsector in Afghanistan. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nOverview of Reconstruction and Economic Situation \n\n8. \nThe result of the more than two decades of conflict and civil strife is utter devastation of \nthe  economy  and  infrastructure,  coupled  with  ravaged  social,  political,  and  ethnic  fabric.  The \nreconstruction  of  Afghanistan  was  a  daunting  task  for  the  transitional  Government  installed  in \n2002. The Government has made significant progress on many fronts. The adoption of a new \nconstitution  in  January  2004  designating  Afghanistan  as  an  Islamic  republic  and  including  a \nstrong  centralized  presidency,  a  bicameral  legislature,  and  gender  equality  in  principle;  the \napproval of an electoral law in May 2004; the presidential elections under universal suffrage in \nOctober  2004;  and  the  prospect  of  parliamentary  elections  in  April  2005  constitute  a  strong \nframework  for  recovery  and  development.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment \nto  political,  economic,  and  social  reform,  and  to  developing  a  free  and  competitive  economic \nsystem  and  private  sector-driven  growth.  It  has  shown  strong  ownership  of  the  reconstruction \neffort, working closely with development agencies to rebuild critical physical infrastructure and to \nreorient Soviet-style public sector institutions to promote market-led development.  \n \n9. \nThe  private  sector  responded  favorably  to  the  Government\u2019s  efforts.  The  International \nMonetary  Fund  estimates  that  real  gross  domestic  product,  excluding  opium  production,  grew \nby about 30% in 2002/03 and 23% in 2003/04. The growth resulted from recovered agricultural \nproduction  after  years  of  drought,  an  urban  construction  boom,  and  increased  service \nestablishments  driven  by  the  international  community\u2019s  spending  and  emergency  assistance \nefforts. Continued strong growth in agriculture, services, and construction is expected in 2004. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy and External Assistance \n\nThe  transitional  Government  declared  that  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the  road \n10. \nsystem, especially of national primary roads, is the country\u2019s top priority in reconstruction. Since \n2002, with external assistance, the Government has been making massive efforts to reestablish \nthe road network, in order to facilitate provision of basic social services to remote provinces, to \nprovide security, and to involve all the population in undertaking nation-building activities.  \n \n11. \nThe national primary roads are being rehabilitated with financial and technical assistance \n(TA) from bilateral and multilateral funding agencies. ADB is financing rehabilitation of the road \nfrom Pul-e Khumri via Mazar-e Sharif to Andkhoy under the $150 million loan for the Emergency  \n\n                                                 \n8   Toll collection has been suspended since September 2002 to prevent abuse of the toll collection system.   \n9   Before 1992, a single department within MPW, the Road Construction and Development Department, had a staff of \n\nmore than 5,000. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nInfrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  (EIRRP).10  The  road  linking  the  ring \nroad  to  Uzbekistan  (Naibabad-Hairatan  road)  is  also  under  the  EIRRP.  The  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty Reduction-financed road rehabilitation from Kandahar to Spin Boldak11 (103.5 km) has \nbeen substantially completed. By early 2005, rehabilitation of 670 km12 of the national roads is \nexpected  to  be  completed.  This  would  double  the  length  of  national  roads  that  are  in  good \ncondition. A list of TA and externally-financed national primary road projects is in Appendix 3. \n \n12. \nAlthough  the  primary  road  network  touches  most  of  the  major  population  centers,  a \nsingle road often connects one population center to another and to the nearest regional center, \nand a regional center to Kabul. Failure of a single road link will have severe impacts not only on \nthe population that it directly serves but also on the population in other parts of the country. A \npronounced  example  is  the  Salang  tunnel\u2014the  only  reliable  transport  connection  between \nKabul  and  the  northern  provinces.  Closure  of  the  Salang  tunnel  virtually  cuts  the  connection \nbetween the north and the south of the country. This vulnerability and lack of redundancy in the \ntransport  system  often  exacerbated  the  division  of  the  country  during  the  conflict  period.  To \nbecome  an  effective  state  with  central  Government  authority  across  the  country,  connectivity \nmust be improved to places and people and thereby integrate all parts of the country. Improving \nthe road network, and in particular strengthening the primary road network, will continue to be \nthe Government\u2019s top priority. Given the country\u2019s resource constraints, continued assistance by \nthe international community will be needed to establish a reliable and robust transport system. \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  weak  capability  to  mobilize  its  own  financial  resources  has  been  a \nmajor  constraint  for  reconstruction  of  Afghanistan.  For  the  fiscal  year  2003/04,  the  central \nGovernment relied on customs duties for 40% of its domestic revenue. This share could have \nbeen  much  higher  if  the  central  Government  had  full  access  to  the  duties  and  charges  being \ncollected  at  border  provinces.  Provincial  governments  still  exert  influence  over  border  and \ncustoms  procedures.  Inadequate  infrastructure  and  outdated  cumbersome  procedures  are \ncausing  enormous  delays  in  moving  things  across  the  border.  Lack  of  proper  control  and \noversight  has  resulted  in  corruption,  smuggling,  and  other  illegal  activities.  To  counter  these \nproblems and broaden the revenue base, the Government prepared a 5-year plan to reform and \nmodernize  customs,  and  is  vigorously  implementing  the  plan  with  assistance  from  the  World \nBank  and  other  funding  agencies.  The  Government  expects  customs  revenue,  and  hence  its \nfinancial  position  to  improve  as  primary  roads  forming  part  of  major  subregional  transport \ncorridors  are  upgraded.  Thus  improvement  of  primary  roads  is  a  strategic  focus  of  the \nGovernment.  \n \nDuring the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \n14. \nfor assistance to quickly improve the Herat-Andkhoy road, which is the last unpaved section of \nthe national primary ring road. ADB provided TA for a feasibility study for the improvement.13 In \nthe  course of  the  study,  the  $80  million  programmed  in  2004  for  the  Herat-Andkhoy  road  was \nidentified as covering at best only the cost to improve about one third of the entire length. During \nthe Fact-Finding Mission in May 2004, the Government asked ADB to reallocate the $55 million \nloan  in  2005,  which  had  originally  been  programmed  for  other  national  roads,  to  cover  part  of \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

Iran  will  finance  the  improvement  of  the  first  60  km  section  from  Herat.  Saudi \nArabia  has  committed  $100  million  for  improving  the  rest  of  the  road.  The  Government  is \nseeking additional external assistance to narrow the financing gap.       \n  \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building and Sector Reform \n\n15. \nTo  counter  the  lack  of  capacity  in  line  ministries  to  plan  and  prepare  projects,  the \nGovernment  established  a  dedicated  agency,  the  Afghanistan  Assistance  Coordination \nAuthority, \nto  handle  planning,  coordination,  preparation,  and  procurement  of  major \nreconstruction projects. The authority was later reorganized into the Afghanistan Reconstruction \nand  Development  Services  (ARDS).  ARDS\u2019s  Procurement  Unit  handles  procurement  for  most \nexternally financed projects. For project implementation, the comprehensive needs assessment \nrecommended  provision  of  assistance  to  MPW  through  a  team  of  international  and  capable \ndomestic  experts  to  compensate  for  the  lack  of  capacity  to  implement  large-scale  projects. \nUnder the ongoing TA cluster for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development,15 ADB \nis  providing  assistance  to  MPW  for  project  planning  and  management.  Under  the  EIRRP,  the \nproject  implementation  unit  established  within  MPW  is  coordinating  with  ARDS  and  gradually \nbuilding  capacity  to  handle  day-to-day  project  implementation.  Several  MPW  staff  have  been \nattached to the contractor and the supervision consultants under the EIRRP to receive on-the-\njob training in project administration and implementation.  \n \nPolicy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  transport  sector  have  been  addressed  by  the \n16. \nPostconflict Multisector Program loan.16 The policy objectives included (i) creating an enabling \nframework  for  market-based  competition  and  efficiency,  (ii)  establishing  safe  and  reliable \ntransport services, (iii) improving institutional efficiency, (iv) establishing a regulatory framework, \n(v)  improving  transparency  and  accountability,  (vi)  instituting  a  mechanism  for  cost  recovery, \n(vii)  encouraging  private  sector  participation,  and  (viii)  establishing  a  system  for  national  road \nimprovement and maintenance.  \n \nThe  Transport  Sector  Review17  studied  these  aspects  and  recommended  major  policy \n17. \nand institutional reforms. The Policy Statement for the Transport Sector, prepared as part of the \nreview exercise, sets out the guiding principles of the recommended reforms and provides the \nframework  for  reform  implementation  (Appendix  4).18  Implementation  of  the  review\u2019s  key \nrecommendations is under way. The restructuring and capacity building of MPW is in progress, \nin  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  reforms  and  restructuring.19  MPW\u2019s  restructuring  will \n\n                                                 \n14   ADB. 2004.

The  intent  of  the \nscheme  is  to  promote  the  reform  and  restructuring  of  ministries  and  Government  agencies.  Ministries  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nchange the ministry into a lean organization that focuses on road network planning and design, \nroad asset management, and regulatory/supervisory functions. Construction work will be mostly \ncontracted out  to  the  private  sector  and  MPW  will  supervise  the  work of  contractors.  For  road \nmaintenance,  MPW  may  have  its  own  construction  units  for  routine  maintenance  and \nemergency  repair,  but  periodic  maintenance  will  be  contracted  out.  For  recovering  the  road \nmaintenance  cost,  the  Government  is  currently  considering  reinstating  toll  collection  on \nimproved road sections. With ADB support, the Government has conducted a preliminary study \non toll rates and is preparing a tolling scheme for the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak road. ADB \nwill continuously support these reform initiatives in the road subsector through the ongoing TA \ncluster and TA programmed in the assistance pipeline.20  \n \n\n4. \n\nSubregional Cooperation for Transport Corridor Development \n\n18. \nThe  efforts  by  Afghanistan  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  its  shattered  road  network \nhave  drawn  much  attention  of  the  neighboring  countries.  An  improved  road  network  in \nAfghanistan  will  result  in  an  improved  transport  network  in  the  subregion.  Landlocked  Central \nAsian  republics  have  shown  a  great  interest  in  establishing  transport  corridors  through \nAfghanistan to warm-water ports on the Arabian Sea and the Gulf. Iran and Pakistan are rapidly \ndeveloping their ports and improving roads connecting to the ports in expectation of increased \nimport/export and transit shipment of goods through their ports.  \n \n19. \nADB  has  been  actively  involved  in  this  subregional  initiative  to  develop  effective \ntransport corridors. Under the TA cluster, ADB provided assistance to develop a framework and \nlegislation  to  facilitate  cross-border  trade.  This  has  evolved  into  the  initiative  to  establish  the \nCentral and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum.21 Under this initiative, meetings have been \nheld to discuss customs harmonization; coordinated border infrastructure development; and law \nenforcement on drug and human trafficking, and money laundering.22   \n \nOn  the  infrastructure  side,  ADB  has  been  financing  two  key  international  links  in \n20. \nAfghanistan:  the  road  from  Kandahar  to  Spin  Boldak  on  the  border  of  Pakistan,  and  the  road \nfrom  Naibabad  to  Hairatan  on  the  Uzbekistan  border.  In  Pakistan,  ADB  is  financing  the \nBalochistan Road Development Sector Project to rehabilitate and widen the Kalat-Quetta (130 \nkm)  and  Quetta  to  Chamman  (117  km)  sections  of  N25  linking  Karachi  through  Chamman  to \nAfghanistan,  and  improve  the  cross-border  facility  and  procedures  at  Chamman.  In  Pakistan, \nADB  will  also  finance  improvement  to  the  road  network  in  the  North-West  Frontier  Province, \nincluding  the  Peshawar-Torkham  (46  km)  and  N55-Ghulam  Khan  (118  km)  sections,  and  the \ncross-border facilities at Torkham and Ghulam Khan. In Central Asia, ADB supports subregional \n\n                                                 \n\nGovernment agencies can apply for PRR status in two stages by submitting preliminary institutional reform plans \nfor stage 1 and by submitting detailed action plans to implement the reforms for stage 2. Once they have obtained \nPRR  status,  employees  who  fill  new  posts  under  the  restructured  organization  are  compensated  with  additional \nsalary  in  the  form  of  an  interim  additional  allowance.  MPW\u2019s  maintenance  department  has  obtained  a  stage-2 \nstatus.  The  survey  and  project  design  department  has  applied  for  the  same  status.  The  planning  department  is \nfollowing suit.   \n\n20   ADB. 2004. Master Plan for Road Network Improvement Project.

Another advisory TA is programmed for the road subsector in 2005 to support institutional reform. \n\n21   The  Central  and  South  Asia  Transport  and  Trade  Forum  comprises  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Iran as an observer. Establishment of the forum was broadly endorsed at the \n1st Ministerial Conference on Transport and Trade in Central and South Asia, 31 July\u20131 August 2003 in Manila. \n22  A working level meeting was held in March 2004, and a working group meeting focusing on trade and customs in \nOctober 2004. A second Ministerial Conference is scheduled for February 2005 to discuss measures to facilitate \nmovement of goods and people in the subregion.  \n\n\f 6\n\ncooperation  and  removal  of  impediments  to  cross-border  road  transport  through  regional  TA \nand road rehabilitation projects in Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSecurity Situation \n\n21. \nAlthough the recent developments in reconstruction, notably the successful presidential \nelection,  are  encouraging,  the  country  still  faces  several  problems  that  could  undermine  the \nprogress  and  hamper  development.  In  a  recent  report  of  the  United  Nations  (UN)  secretary \ngeneral to the UN Security Council, extremist violence, factionalism, and the narcotics industry \nare highlighted as threats to the consolidation of peace and stability in Afghanistan.23 On these \nfronts,  the  Government  has  made  significant  achievements  in  the  past  2  years.  They  include \ninauguration  of  the  Afghan  National  Army  and  national  police  force;  commencement  of  major \nreform in the Ministry of Defense; initial implementation of a disarmament, demobilization, and \nreintegration  program;  formulation  of  a  national  drug  control  strategy;  and  steady  progress  in \nremoving land mines. The internationally sponsored security arrangements for Kabul, based on \nthe  International  Security  Assistance  Forces  in  cooperation  with  Afghan  security  forces,  have \nworked  reasonably  well.  Security  on  the  main  intercity  roads  has  improved  significantly \ncompared with the situation 2 years ago.  \n \n22. \nHowever,  the  security  situation  outside  Kabul  still  largely  depends  on  a  delicate  power \nbalance between local warlords and the central Government in Kabul. In the country\u2019s southern, \nsoutheastern,  and  eastern  provinces,  activity  of  international  development  agencies  and \nnongovernment  organizations  has  been  disrupted  by  the  revival  of  Taliban  elements.  The \nGovernment has been making every effort to curtail the influence of the warlords and factional \nleaders  in  the  reconstruction  activity.  The  disarmament,  demobilization,  and  reintegration \nprogram is the key instrument to reduce the number and size of private militias and undercut the \nmilitary  strength  of  the  regional  governors.  Progress  has  been  slow.  By  the  end  of  July  2004, \nonly a little over 12% of the militia forces are estimated to have turned in their weapons. In the \npolitical  arena,  the  Government  has  made  some  gain  in  decreasing  the  influence  of  warlords \nand factional leaders by both inclusive and confrontational measures. The central Government \nbanned local warlords from assuming political and military posts in a provincial government, and \noffered them posts in the central Government. Some warlords accepted the offer. Vacated posts \nin  the  provincial  governments  were  filled  with  officials  from  Kabul.  Still  in  many  parts  of  the \ncountry, quasi-autonomy continues to exist under the rule of local leaders with different scales. \nThey  collect  taxes  and  customs  duties  in  the  case  of  border  provinces  and  support  their \noperations.  This  significantly  reduces  the  central  Government\u2019s  ability  to  collect  revenues  to \nprovide  for  basic  central  government  functions.  This  situation  enables  regional  warlords  to \nmaintain  their  military  strength  and  keep  their  influence  over  regional  politics  far  off  from  the \ncentral  Government.  This  leads  to  fragile  security  over  the  country.  The  security  situation  will \ncontinue  to  constrain  the  progress  of  reconstruction,  and  security  concerns  may  continue  to \ndiscourage foreign and large-scale domestic investment.  \n \n23. \nThis  fragile  security  situation,  exacerbated  by  the  influence  of  local  warlords  and \nfactional leaders, will adversely affect the implementation of ADB-financed projects because (i) \nthe  security  hazard  around  project  locations  may  disrupt  and  delay  construction  work;  (ii)  the \nsupply of raw materials, which will have to be transported through areas under the influence of \nregional  warlords,  may  be  hampered;  and  (iii)  the  supervision  of  construction  work  by \n\n                                                 \n23  United Nations Security Council. 2004.

Implementation of the Japan Fund For Poverty \nReduction-financed  project  to  rehabilitate  the  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  road\u2014the  first  ADB \nintervention  in  the  road  subsector\u2014has  been  seriously  hampered  by  the  interference  of \nfactional  leaders  and  the  deteriorating  security  situation.  Mobilization  of  machinery  and  plants \nexperienced  inordinate  delays  due  to  longer  time  required  for  transportation  across  warlord-\ncontrolled provinces. Repeated threats to the construction workers and security incidents in and \naround  Kandahar  demoralized  the employees  of  the  contractor  and  consultants. To  overcome \nthese  problems,  efforts  have  been  made  to  win  the  support  of  communities  near  the \nconstruction  site  through  grassroots  outreach.  The  collaboration  of  local  government  officials \nand village leaders was also sought. ADB is devising security arrangements under TA24 to help \nprovide  a  safe  work  environment  for  on-site  personnel  assigned  by  the  contractors  and \nconsulting firms through close cooperation with provincial authorities. \n \n\n6. \n\nOpium-Related Problems \n\n24. \nAfghanistan is the world\u2019s largest producer of illicit opium. The current ban on cultivation \nhas  had  an  extremely  limited  effect.  Opium  is  a  major  source  of  cash  income  for  farmers \nbecause of its ready profitability, and their lack of other livelihood alternatives. According to the \nUN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium was cultivated on 80,000 hectares in 2003, an increase \nof 8% over 2002, and production increased by 6% to 3,600 tons, 20 times more than in 2001, \nthe last year of Taliban rule. Farmers grew poppies in 28 of the country\u2019s 32 provinces in 2003, \nup  from  18  in  1999.  About  264,000  families,  or  about  7%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  population,  are \nestimated to be producing poppies, each cultivating an average of 0.3 hectares. The UN Office \non Drugs and Crime estimates average yearly earnings at $3,900 per opium-growing family, or \n$594 per capita, in a country where per capita gross domestic product is only $207.25 The share \nof  poppy  production  in  the  economy  is  large.  If  opium  exports  were  included,  total  gross \ndomestic product would be 40% greater.  \n \nPoppy  cultivation,  and  narcotics  production  and  trade  constitute  a  major  threat  to \n25. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  security  and  political  normalization,  and  tie  the  poor  rural  population  to  regional \nwarlords  and  international  crime  syndicates.  To  combat  this  problem,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped a national counternarcotics strategy, and is working with aid agencies involved in the \nsecurity  sector  to  contain  and  eradicate  poppy  cultivation  and  provide  support  for  alternative \nlivelihoods. ADB support focuses on helping farm households develop livelihood alternatives to \npoppy cultivation. ADB activities include creating an enabling environment for commercializing \nand  diversifying  agricultural  production,  and  rehabilitating  irrigation  systems.  ADB  is  using  a \ndemand-driven,  participatory,  and  community-based  approach.  ADB,  through  some  of  its \nsubregional  activities,  is  supporting  measures  to  contain  the  flow  of  narcotics  across  borders. \nThese include building capacity and strengthening customs and immigration departments in the \nregion.  Under  the  Central  And  South  Asia  Transport  And  Trade  Forum,  Afghanistan  and  its \nneighboring countries are discussing ways to contain drug trafficking across borders. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nA  number  of  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  past  emergency  assistance  projects,  best \n26. \npractices, and initial lending and nonlending operations of ADB in Afghanistan since 2002. First, \ncontinued emphasis has to be given to capacity building to improve planning, project design and \n\n                                                 \n24  ADB. 2004.

Third,  aid  groups  must \nwork  closely  with  a  country\u2019s  ministry  of  finance  and  central  bank  to  develop  a  viable  and \nworking payment system, without which maintaining a flow of funds is difficult. Fourth, capacity \nbuilding  in  executing  agencies  is  vital,  and  consulting  services  for  project  design  and \nimplementation  should  provide  for  the  training  of  executing  agency  staff  in  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  rehabilitated  facilities.  Fifth,  the  number  of  procurement  packages  should  be \nminimized,  given  the  limited  implementation  capacity  of  executing  agencies.  Sixth,  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement  guidelines  should  be  applied  flexibly  for  emergency  assistance  projects  to  allow \nreduced procurement periods for the urgent delivery of project components. Seventh, extensive \nsecurity plans should be in place to address possible security hazards in project locations that \ncould hamper smooth project implementation. All these lessons are incorporated in the design \nof the Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n27. \nThe main objective of the Project is to reduce poverty and promote economic and social \ndevelopment  through  continued  support  to  the  Government  to  (i)  reestablish  the  primary  road \nnetwork  damaged  during  two  decades  of  conflict  and  neglect,  and  (ii)  help  implement  cost-\nrecovery measures. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s assistance strategy outlined in the country \nstrategy  and  program  update  (footnote  14),  which  includes  focusing  on  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure.  While  the  Project  involves  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  an  important \nsection of the primary road network, the related policy and institutional reforms in the transport \nsector  have  been  addressed  by  the  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  (footnote  16)  and  the \nTransport  Sector  Review.  The  cost-recovery  measures  for  road  maintenance  will  be  studied \nunder  a  separate  TA  to  prepare  a  road  subsector  master  plan.27  The  Project  will  finance  the \npurchase and installation of the facilities required for road tolling. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImprovement to Key Primary Road Section \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  finance  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  Andkhoy-Qaisar  road \n(210 km). The Project will improve the project road to an asphalt-paved standard that will allow \nsmooth  passage  of  heavy  vehicles.  The  current  condition  of  the  project  road  and  proposed \ndesign standards are in Appendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nProvision of Road Tolling Facility  \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  also  finance  installation  of  road  tolling  facilities  including  toll  plazas, \ncomputers  and  communications  equipment,  and  weighing  machines  for  the  project  road  and \nother primary roads being improved with external financial assistance. The installation will be in \nthree phases: (i) the first phase will be the Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak corridor; (ii) the second \nphase will cover the northern roads currently being rehabilitated under the EIRRP, and (iii) the \n\n                                                 \n26  ADB  is  a  co-focal  point  of  the  Afghanistan\u2019s  Transport  Consultative  Group,  which  has  been  a  forum  for  \ncoordination and information sharing among funding agencies, and providing support to the Government including \npreparation of development budgets. \n\n27 ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nthird  phase  will  be  the  project  road.  The  Government  is  now  preparing  road  tolling \nimplementation  plans  for  the  first  phase  installation.  These  will  be  finalized  by  the  end  of  the \ncurrent  fiscal  year.  For  the  remaining  roads  to  be  tolled,  tolling  strategy  and  implementation \nplans will be developed under the road subsector master plan TA.      \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nIn view of the exceptionally difficult postconflict circumstances that continue to prevail in \nAfghanistan,  the  Government  has  requested  the  softer  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  terms \nprovided under the previous four loans from ADB to Afghanistan. The request is supported by \nrecent  analysis  on  Afghanistan\u2019s  debt  sustainability  by  ADB  and  the  International  Monetary \nFund,  which  concludes  that  funding  for  development  projects  in  Afghanistan  should  be  on  a \ngrant basis, or under highly concessional terms for key projects and reforms for which no grant \nfunding can be mobilized. Afghanistan is eligible for grant funding under the recently concluded \nADF  IX  replenishment.  This  will  result  in  softer  lending  terms  for  Afghanistan.  Until  ADF  IX \nbecomes effective in 2005, special lending terms are proposed as follows: (i) grandfathering the \npre-1999  ADF  lending  terms  so  that  the  loan  has  40-year  maturity  including  a  10-year  grace \nperiod,  with  1%  interest  charge  throughout  its  term,  and  (ii)  capitalizing  and  charging  the  total \namount of the interest charge during the grace period to the loan account. These special lending \nterms  were  applied  for  other  projects  approved  for  Afghanistan  since  ADB  lending  operations \nresumed in late 2002. Further, the waiver of cost-sharing limit that has been approved for loans \nand TA operations for Afghanistan28 is applied to the Project.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n31. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $80  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  the  10-year  grace  period.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated at $60.7 million, representing about 76% of the total cost. The local currency cost is \nestimated at $19.3 million equivalent, or about 24% of the total cost. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 6. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n32. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $80  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  ADB \nloan will finance 100% of the total project cost. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n33.  MPW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  existing \nProject  Management  Unit  (PMU),  which  handles  the  ongoing  Kandahar-Spin  Boldak  Road \nProject and the EIRRP road component (Appendix 7). The PMU will (i) monitor the progress of \nday-to-day  project  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project \nprogress  reports,  and  (iv)  maintain  project  accounts  and  complete  loan  financial  records  for \nauditing. The deputy minister of MPW will have overall responsibility for project management as \nproject  director  of  the  PMU.  The  Project  will  augment  the  capacity  of  the  PMU  by  funding  a \n\n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2002.

The  engineers  will  be \nstationed in the field to handle day-to-day project implementation. The PMU will be assisted by \nconsultants  engaged  under  the  TA  cluster  (footnote  15).  The  project  management  and  TA \ncoordination  specialist  will  continue  to  assist  the  PMU  with  overall  project  management.  The \nfinancial management and auditing specialist will assist the PMU with financial management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n34. \nThe Project is of an emergency nature and will be implemented over 36 months starting \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. By employing design-build contract modality, the lead-time \nrequired for project preparation has been reduced. The consulting services contract is expected \nto be awarded at the beginning of the first quarter of 2005, and the civil works by the end of the \nfirst quarter of 2005. Civil works will be completed in the third quarter of 2007 (Appendix 8).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n35. \nProcurement of goods, services, and civil works to be financed under the ADB loan will \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Due  to  the  emergency \nnature  of  project  implementation,  the  Government  requested  flexible  application  of  such \nguidelines.  This  includes  shorter  bidding  period  for  international  procurement.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  A  single-stage  two-\nenvelope  procedure  with  no  separate  prequalification,  which  has  been  used  in  the  two \npreceding ADB-financed road projects in Afghanistan and has proven to be effective in reducing \ntime  required  for  procurement,  will  be  used.  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  ICB  for  contracts \nwith an estimated value of more than $500,000, international shopping for contracts estimated \nat  $100,000\u2013500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangement  for  contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 9. All international procurements will be \nundertaken by the Government Procurement Unit operating under ARDS.  \n \n36. \nTaking account of the urgent need expressed by the Government to commence the road \nimprovement works, a two-pronged approach will be used: (i) use on a force account basis, of \nMPW\u2019s  existing  construction  plant,  equipment,  and  labor  force  for  the  preliminary  works,  such \nas  site  clearing,  leveling,  grading,  and  compacting  of  the  existing  road;  and  (ii)  packaging  the \nremaining works to rehabilitate damaged embankment and provide asphalt-surfaced pavement \nunder civil works contracts, to be undertaken by international contractors selected through ICB \nprocedures.  \n \n37. \nThe  project area  is  located  in  the  western  part of  the country,  where  ADB  nonmember \ncountries,  particularly  those  in  the  Gulf  region,  provide  competitive  sources  of  materials, \nespecially bitumen required for road pavement. Explicit procurement restrictions may preclude \ncivil works contractors under the Project from seeking the best business terms, and ultimately \nerode  economic  efficiency.  To  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  development  impact  and  economic \nefficiency, it is proposed that civil works contractors under the Project be allowed to procure the \nbitumen  required  for  road  pavement  from  all  countries,  including  from  countries  that  are  not \nADB members.29 \n \n\n                                                 \n29  This is pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB Charter, which provides that the Board may, by a vote of the directors \nrepresenting  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of  the  members,  agree  to  permit  in  special \ncircumstances procurement from non-ADB member countries \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n38. \nConsulting services will be required to help MPW implement the Project. The consulting \nservices  will  involve  (i)  certification  of  the  force  account  works,  (ii)  supervision  of  the  design-\nbuild  civil  works  contracts,  (iii)  supervision  of  supply  and  installation  of  tolling  equipment,  and \n(iv)  project  performance  monitoring.  An  international  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants will provide the consulting services and on-the-job training to counterpart staff. \n \nAll consultants financed from the ADB loan will be selected and engaged in accordance \n39. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  recruitment  of \ndomestic  consultants  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  consulting  firm  for  construction  supervision  and \nmonitoring  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  for \nrecruiting  firms  under  full  technical  proposals.  The  consulting  services  will  require  about  100 \nperson-months of international consulting and about 500 person-months of domestic consulting. \nThe outline terms of reference for consulting services are provided in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n40. \nIn view of the high priority accorded to the Project by the Government, and to minimize \nimplementation delays and ensure timely completion of the Project, the Government requested \nADB  approval  for  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  packages  and  advance \nrecruitment  action  for  consultants.  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  commencing  recruitment \nof consultants and procurement of ICB civil works contracts. The Government was informed that \nthe approval of advance actions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n \n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n41. \nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nAn  imprest  account,  primarily  for  incremental  expenditures  related  to  project  management \nsupport for MPW, will be established under the Ministry of Finance at the Da Afghanistan Bank \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited to \nthe imprest account will be the lesser of the estimated 6-month expenditure or 10% of the loan \namount.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \nand liquidate the imprest advance for any individual payment not exceeding $50,000 equivalent. \n  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n42. \nThe overall institutional setup and procedure for accounting, auditing, and reporting will \nfollow what is currently being established for the ongoing EIRRP. MPW will maintain separate \naccounts and records for the Project in accordance with sound accounting principles, adequate \nto  identify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources, \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  These  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB no later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year. The \nannual audits will include an audit of the imprest account and statement of expenditure records, \nand  a  separate  opinion  on  the  audit.  The  unaudited  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. The \nGovernment will facilitate ADB representatives\u2019 conduct of spot and random checks on the flow \nof funds and their use for the Project and work in progress.  \n \n\n\f 12\n\n43.  MPW  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  performance  monitoring,  issues \nresolution, and periodic action plans. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback to update and \nimprove procedures and project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MPW will submit a project completion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n44.  MPW will undertake quantitative and qualitative performance monitoring to evaluate the \ndelivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  project  benefits  accrued.  Within  6  months  of  the \neffective date of the Loan Agreement, MPW, with the assistance of loan-financed consultants, \nwill develop a comprehensive project performance monitoring system in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management System Handbook. ADB will review and approve the system. \nWithin  3  months  of  the  effective  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will \nagree on the performance parameters to be monitored during implementation of the Project.  \n \n\n \n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n45. \nADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased  on  the  project  schedule,  a  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  about  18  months  after \nproject  commencement,  around  September  2006.  The  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a \ndetailed progress report on the Project\u2019s implementation and achievements prior to the midterm \nreview. Terms of reference for the midterm review will be included in the project administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n46. \nThe  Andkhoy-Qaisar  road  is  one  of  the  last  unpaved  sections  of  the  national  primary \nroad network. The Project will dramatically decrease the vehicle operating costs and passenger \ntime  on  the  project  road.  The  primary  beneficiaries  will  be  the  residents  in  the  project  area, \nestimated at about 800,000 and mostly engaged in agriculture; 50% live under the poverty line. \nThe residents will benefit from improved access to health, education, and other social services. \nBenefits will also arise from the increased prices of agricultural products, for which the project \narea is endowed with a significant resource base. The project road will form part of the second \npaved road corridor linking the north and south of the country across the central mountains, will \nadd  to  the  country\u2019s  road  network,  and  significantly  improve  the  reliability  of  road  transport. \nIncreased  trade  and  transit  through  the  improved  transport  corridor  from  Central  Asia  through \nAfghanistan  to  Iran  and  Pakistan,  including  the  project  road,  will  benefit  a  broad  range  of \npopulation  including  consumers,  manufacturers,  and  transport  operators  who  will  directly  or \nindirectly use goods and services transported on the project road \n \nA. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n47. \nThe  prolonged  war  in  the  country  exacerbated  by  drought  has  severely  affected  the \nlivelihoods of the local population. About 53% of the population are classified as poor and live \non  less  than  $1  a  day  (footnote  14).  Decline  in  farm  productivity  and  loss  of  seasonal \nopportunities for agriculture labor are the main determinants of poverty. An estimate of poverty \nincidence  through  proxy  measures  in  the  project  influence  area  indicates  that  about  35\u201350% \nhouseholds  are  poor,  and  among  the  poor  households  50\u201380%  live  in  absolute  poverty.  The \naverage  monthly  income  of  the  poor  households  was  as  low  as  AF3,700.  Most  villages  in  the \nproject influence area lack primary health care facilities or are located at least 10 km away from \nthe nearest basic health care clinic. Due to the absence of primary health care facilities coupled \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nwith poor condition of roads and lack of transportation facilities, the mortality rate was observed \nto  be  high  among  women  and  children  from  simple  complications  of  childbirth,  lack  of  proper \nimmunization, and preventable childhood illnesses.  \n \nThe  direct  poverty  impact  would  be  from  income  generation  and  demand  for  unskilled \n48. \nlabor  resulting  directly  from  road  construction.  The  improved  road  will  significantly  reduce \ntransport  cost  and  travel  time.  This  will  translate  into  improved  access  to  schools,  medical \nclinics,  and  employment  centers.  The  improved  road  will  decrease  the  chances  of  accident \ndeaths  and  disabilities  that  have  resulted  from  extremely  poor  road  conditions.  The  poverty \nimpact  ratio  (0.69)  indicates  that  the  poor  will  receive  a  high  proportion  of  these  benefits.  The \nindirect,  but  important  impact  will  be  the  growth  of  local  trade  and  production  activities,  and \nreduced  prices  of  commodities  facilitated  by  improved  access  to  local,  national,  and \ninternational  markets.  The  road  improvement  is  also  expected  to  mainstream  local economies \nwith the overall national economy, and facilitate exploitation of available natural resources, such \nas  minerals,  gas,  and  other  resources.  These  benefits  are  expected  to  significantly  increase \nhousehold incomes and quality of life, and reduce the overall poverty incidence. The economic \nassessment and distributional analysis are provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n  \n49. \nIncidence of poverty among women is higher than among men and is characterized by \nlow  endowment  of  land  and  productive  assets,  unemployment,  discrimination  in  the  labor \nmarket, and limited access to economic options and political processes. Women in Afghanistan \nare  generally  denied  inheritance  rights,  adequate  food  and  nutrition,  choice  of  education,  and \nparticipation  in  the  decision-making  process  of  household  economic  activities.  In  the  project \narea, the level of attainment in elementary education ranges between 12\u201336% for women and is \nmuch  lower  than  that  for  men,  which  ranges  between  62\u201377%.  However,  with  the  recent \nappreciation  for  education  for  women  and  changing  socioeconomic  realities,  especially  due  to \nthe increased number of households headed by women, consequent to loss of male members, \nthe involvement of women in economic activities is slowly beginning to be acceptable. Although \nwomen will not benefit from direct employment opportunities to be provided under the Project, \nthey  will  benefit  from  reduced  travel  times  and  transport  costs.  With  the  improved  road, \ncombined  with  increased  availability  of  transport  services,  women  will  find  it  easier  to  reach \nschools, clinics, hospitals, other market centers, and district and provincial capitals.  \n \n50.  While  the  project  area  is  ethnically  heterogeneous,  different  ethnic  groups  are \nsegregated by functions, and sometimes by district. The social assessment did not identify the \npresence of any indigenous population.  \n \n51. \nAfghanistan  is  considered  to  have  a  low  prevalence  of  human  immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  prevalence  but  to  be  at  high  risk  for \nspread  of  HIV  infection.  The  reasons  behind  this  include  (i)  over  two  decades  of  protracted \narmed  conflicts,  (ii)  low  sociopolitical  and  economic  status  of  women,  (iii)  huge  numbers  of \npeople  displaced  internally  and  externally,  (iv)  the  extremely  poor  social  and  public  health \ninfrastructure,  (v)  drug  trafficking,  (vi)  use  of  injecting  drugs,  and  (vii)  lack  of  blood  safety \npractices.  Only  11  cases  of  HIV  have  been  reported  to  the  World  Health  Organization  for \nAfghanistan, although many more cases may be undetected and unreported.  \n \n52. \nNongovernment organizations and UN agencies, such as the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund  and  the  World  Health  Organization,  are  already  active  in  the  area  of  HIV/AIDS  in \nAfghanistan. The Government is working on the National Plan of Action against HIV/AIDS and \nSexually Transmitted Diseases. The national program (2004\u20132010) focuses on surveillance and \nresearch;  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  through  information,  education  and  communication  and \n\n\f 14\n\nbehavioral  change  communication;  prevention  and  effective  management  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections; blood safety and voluntary counselling and testing; and care, treatment, \nand support. The national program targets to achieve coverage of 100% district hospitals with \nblood screening services and safe blood supply; establishment of voluntary counselling centers \ntransmitted \nin  Kabul  and  several  major  cities;  and  80%  of  provinces  with  sexually \ndisease/HIV/AIDS control, care, and support service systems by the end of 2010. In order to link \nwith the national program, a suitable clause requiring the contractors to conduct education and \ncommunication  activities  for  their  employees  with  support  of  qualified  nongovernment \norganizations will be included in the civil works contracts.  \n \n53. \nThe  road  improvement  will  be  carried  out  along  the  existing  alignment  and  on  the \nexisting  embankment.  In  places  were  the  existing  embankment  is  not  wide  enough  to \naccommodate  the  design  width,  the  shoulder  width  has  been  reduced  to  avoid  resettlement \nimpacts.  However,  after  finalization  of  detailed  design  during  implementation,  if  resettlement \nimpacts  are  identified,  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement.  This  is  addressed  in  the  loan  assurances.  A  summary  of  the  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\nThe  economic  assessment  (Appendix  12)  was  conducted  for  the  entire  stretch  of  the \n54. \nHerat-Andkhoy  road  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects.  The  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  was  used  to  calculate  vehicle \noperating costs and time costs with modification for conditions in Afghanistan. The major inputs \ninclude vehicle characteristics and related costs, and construction and maintenance costs. The \nmajor  benefits  are  derived  from  savings  of  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  due  to \nrehabilitation of the project road, which will provide a stimulus for economic growth in the project \narea. The time required for traveling from Andkhoy to Qaisar is currently more than 8 hours. The \nProject  will  reduce  this  to  2.5  hours.  The  travel  time  on  the  entire  Herat-Andkhoy  road  is \ncurrently  more  than  24  hours  with  an  average  travel  speed  of  slightly  more  than  20  km/hour. \nTogether with the planned improvement to other road sections of the Herat-Andkhoy road, the \nProject will contribute to significant reduction in travel time and cost, turning the painful road trip \nalong the Herat-Andkhoy road into a safe single-day daylight trip. \n \n55. \nThe current traffic level is low due to the very poor condition of the road and the overall \nreduced economic activity due to many years of war and the recent severe draught. Considering \nthat a strong economic recovery is anticipated in the short term, a high level of generated and \ninduced  traffic  is  expected.  Based  on  this  development  prospect,  the  generated  and  induced \ntraffic  was  estimated  in absolute  numbers  assuming  expected  growth  of  outputs  and  activities \nand trip rates, considered to be realized 3 years after the project road becomes operational. \n \n56. \nAn economic evaluation resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 19.1% for the \noverall  project  road.  The  project  road  was  evaluated  up  to  and  including  2027,  providing  a \nbenefit period of 20 years; a residual value of 10% was applied in 2027. The traffic estimate is \nstill  conservative,  as  it  does  not  include  international  transit  traffic  from  the  three  neighboring \ncountries (Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) adjacent to the northwest region.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact  \n\n57. \nThe Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines (2003).  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nthe  summary  is  attached  as  Appendix  13.  The  IEE  found  that  the  environmental  impacts \nassociated  with  the  Project  would  mostly  occur  during  construction.  The  potential  adverse \nimpacts  are  temporary  and  manageable.  Mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the \ncontract document. The IEE recommends that no environmental assessment study is required. \n  \nD. \n\nRisks \n\nImplementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n\n58. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile.  ADB  will  need  to \nclosely monitor the situation and coordinate with local and central authorities and \nthe  UN  to  ensure  adequate  protection.30  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  the  Security  of  ADB-\nFinanced  Projects  in  Afghanistan  will  provide  advice  on  how  to  ensure  a  safe \nwork  environment \nthe  contractors, \nsubcontractors,  and  consulting  firms.  Under  the  prevailing  conditions,  however, \nthis  security  risk  cannot  be  mitigated  completely,  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation,  if  security  hazards  occur  in  project  locations,  will  be  inevitable \ndespite measures put in place to control the risk. \n\nfor  on-site  personnel  assigned  by \n\nThe regional warlords and militia leaders maintain their military strength and their \ninfluence in regional politics. This political instability could hamper smooth supply \nof  raw  materials  and  equipment,  which  would  be  transported  through  areas \ncontrolled  by  regional  warlords  and  militia  leaders,  and  constrain  supervision  of \nconstruction works by the consultants and ADB staff.   \n\nImproved roads can be used as a route to transport opium. The Government will \nimprove, as part of the national counternarcotics strategy, border procedures to \ncontain  the  movement  of  opium.  However,  the  trafficking  of  opium  cannot  be \ncompletely contained unless cultivation of opium is eradicated.  \n\nBecause  Government  implementation  capacity  is  very  weak,  implementation  of \nkey activities may be delayed. Also the lack of accounting and auditing capacity \nimplies a risk of corruption. Resources will be allocated for consulting services to \nhelp  with  project  management  and  implementation.  Additional  capacity-building \ninitiatives  focused  on  financial  management  have  been  provided  under  the  TA \ncluster.  The  Government  will  establish  a  strong  coordination  and  monitoring \nmechanism. ADB will also field review missions as frequent as necessary. \n\nThe Government may have difficulty providing required counterpart resources, in \na timely manner. ADB will work closely with MPW to address this issue. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n59. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nSecurity. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security \narrangements for smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. \n\n                                                 \n30  Coordination  with  the  provincial  reconstruction  teams  providing  security  for  development  activities  in  the  project \n\narea may also be explored.  \n\n\f 16\n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nDrug  trafficking.  The  Government  will  undertake  concrete  measures  to  detect \nand  prevent  opium  smuggling  by  land  transport,  including  by  improving  border \nprocedures. \n\nRoad  maintenance  financing.  The  Government  will  allocate  and  make \navailable, in a timely manner, sufficient funds from its budget for each fiscal year \nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities,  and  will  ensure  that \nsuch facilities are operated and maintained in accordance with sound practices in \nthe  transport  sector.  For  the  maintenance  of  the  project  road,  the  Government \nwill ensure implementation of a toll collection system on improved roads. In doing \nthis,  the  Government  will  adopt  adequate  procedures  to  promote  transparency \nand accountability in the collection of the proceeds from the toll collection system \nand other means of revenue generation, and install proper procedures including \nspot audits to track any abuse in the collection and utilization of these proceeds. \n\nRoad  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  road  safety  measures  are \nincorporated in the design of the Project and public awareness campaign of such \nmeasures will be conducted on a periodic basis.  \n\nDuties  and  levies.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  duties  or  other  similar \nlevies  will  be  imposed  on  any  equipment,  material,  or  services  required  for  the \nProject,  and  if  such  duties  and  levies  are  imposed,  they  will  be  paid  by  the \nGovernment promptly to ensure timely project implementation. \n\nSpot  audits.  The  Government  will  allow  and  facilitate  ADB's  representatives  to \ncarry  out  spot  and  random  checks  on  (i)  flow  of  funds  and  their  use  for  the \nProject; and (ii) work in progress.  \n\n \n(vii)  Anticorruption.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or \nmanagerial impropriety in the conduct of the Project. The Government and each \nof  its  relevant  agencies  will  fully  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such investigations.  \n\n \n(viii)  Land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people.  To  the  extent \nfeasible, the Government will ensure that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nthe project road will be carried out on land already acquired and/or owned by the \nGovernment.  If  adjustments  to  the  rights-of-way  necessitate  land  acquisition,  a \nresettlement plan will be prepared by the Government and submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval to ensure that the social and economic base of the affected \npersons,  regardless  of  the  land  title,  will  be  restored  and/or  enhanced  through \nmitigating  measures.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities will be carried out in accordance with the relevant laws and \npolicies  of  the  Government,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995) \nand  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  which  will  be  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  plan.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-\nway  required  for  project  implementation  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely \nmanner.  If  any  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  identified  during \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  prepare  an  indigenous  peoples \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\ndevelopment  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). \n\nEnvironmental  protection.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  adequate \nenvironmental  protection  and  safety  measures  as  described  in  the  IEE  and \nsummary  IEE  are  included  in  the  design  of  the  project  facilities;  and  that  the \nProject  is  implemented,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  the \nrelevant laws and policies of the Government, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), \nthe IEE, and summary IEE including the environment monitoring plan. \n\nLocal  consultation  and  gender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  specific \nplan  for  local  consultation  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  issues,  during \nproject  implementation,  will  be  included  in  the  bidding  documents.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  men  and  women  are  given  equal  employment \nopportunities,  without  any  differentiation  of  wages  for  equal  work  by  the  civil \nworks  contractors.  The  mechanisms  for  maximizing  local  employment  benefits \nwill be included in the project design and the bidding documents.  \n\nLabor. The Government will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally \nmandated  provisions  on  health  and  sanitation  and  on  appropriate  working \nconditions, including as appropriate, accommodation for construction workers at \ncampsites during the construction period. The Government will also ensure that \ncivil  work  contractors  do  not  employ  children  for  construction  and  maintenance \nworks. A specific clause to this effect will be included in the bidding documents \nand compliance will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \n\n \n(xii)  Health  risks  and  provisions.

Of  the  national  roads,  3,300  km  are  national  primary  roads \nincluding  2,400  km  that  were  originally  paved.  The  national  primary  road  network  consists \nlargely  of  the  2,300  km  ring  road  that  connects  Afghanistan\u2019s  major  regional  centers  (Herat, \nKandahar,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Maimana,  and  Sheberghan)  with  Kabul,  and  the  roads  linking  to \nneighboring  countries  including  Iran,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The \nremaining 2,800 km of national roads are secondary roads with either gravel or earthen surface. \nThe  15,000  km  of  provincial  roads  are  gravel  or  earthen,  and  categorized  into  5,400  km  of \nprovincial primary roads and 9,600 km of provincial secondary roads. The tertiary road network \nconsists  of  rural  roads  that  are  roughly  estimated  to  be  15,000\u201320,000  km,  and  substantial \nlengths of urban roads roughly estimated to be 3,000 km including 1,060 km in Kabul. \n \nMost  of  the  national  primary  road  network  was  improved  to  the  paved  standard  before \n2. \nthe  conflict,  mainly  with  external  assistance.  The  ring-road  section  from  Jawzjan-Faryab \nprovince border to Herat (575 km) was left unpaved due to the outbreak of civil conflict.  \n \nMuch of Afghanistan\u2019s road infrastructure was destroyed or damaged in more than two \n3. \ndecades  of  conflict.  Lack  of  resources  and  capacity  prevented  maintenance,  and  has  led  to \nmajor  deterioration  and  loss  of  infrastructure.  The  effects  of  military  actions  are  more \npronounced in the form of damaged bridges and tunnels, which have become bottlenecks to the \nmovement  of  people  and  goods.  Restricted  movement  aggravates  the  country\u2019s  division  and \ndisintegration, as travel time and vehicle operating cost on roads have significantly increased.1 \n  \n4. \nAccording to the comprehensive needs assessment on the Afghanistan transport sector, \ncarried  out  during  March-May  2002  by  major  external  funding  agencies  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), 54% of the national roads are in poor condition, 26% in fair condition, \nand only 20% in good condition. It urged the entire primary road network be rehabilitated on a \npriority basis.2 \n \n5. \nAfghanistan\u2019s road network is characterized by very low road density. The road \ndensity of 0.03 km per square km (km2) is far lower than that of Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, \nwhich  also  have  largely  mountainous  terrain  and  similar  population  densities,  and  even  lower \nthan  0.07  km/km2  road  density  of  Balochistan  in  Pakistan,  whose  population  density  is  about \nhalf of Afghanistan\u2019s. Even without the damage inflicted during the conflict period, Afghanistan\u2019s \nroad network is in need of substantial improvement to provide basic connectivity that is available \nelsewhere in the subregion.   \n\n5. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1    Travel  from  Kabul  to  Kandahar  (1,066  km)  used  to  take  less  than  12  hours  before  the  conflict.  Soon  after  the \n\nconflict, it took about 30 hours with a four-wheel drive vehicle. \n\n2  A  preliminary  needs  assessment  was  conducted  in  December  2001  by  ADB,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme,  and  World  Bank,  and  was  presented  at  the  Ministerial  Meeting  in  Tokyo  in  January  2002,  where \nexternal funding agencies pledged about $4.5 billion assistance.   \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nCountry \n\nAfghanistan  \nAzerbaijan \nBangladesh \nIndia \nIndonesia \nKyrgyz Republic \nNepal \nPakistan \nSri Lanka \nTajikistan \nTurkmenistan \nUzbekistan \n\nTable A2.1: Comparison of Key Road Subsector Indicators \nRoad Density  \nin 2000 \n(km/square km) \n0.032 \n0.287 \n1.441 \n1.010 \n0.180 \n0.170 \n0.090 \n0.320 \n1.465 \n0.194 \n0.049 \n0.183 \n\n \nPercent of Road \nPaved \n16 \n92 \n9 \n46 \n47 \n40 \n31 \n43 \n95 \n83 \n81 \n87 \n\nGNP per Capita \nin 2002 \n($) \n186 \n710 \n360 \n480 \n710 \n290 \n230 \n410 \n840 \n180 \n        1,200 \n450 \n\nMotor Vehicles \nper 1,000 people  \nin 2000 \n14 \n49 \n1 \n8 \n25 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n8 \n34 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\nGNP = gross national product, km = kilometer. \nSource: World Bank, Word Development Indicators 2002.

According to \nstatistics  provided  in  a  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  country  report  on  Afghanistan,3 \ntransport  of  goods  by  road  increased  from  1.9  million  tons  in  2000  to  3.7  million  tons  in  2001 \nand 5 million tons in 2002, representing an almost fourfold increase. Number of taxicabs nearly \ndoubled from 17,000 in 2000 to 33,500 in 2002. More than 147,000 vehicles were estimated to \nbe  registered  in  Kabul,  which  under  certain  assumptions  would  translate  into  about  304,000 \nvehicles countrywide. Most vehicles are owned and operated by the private sector.  \n \n7. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT)-operated  fleet has  been  severely  depleted.  According \nto the Central Statistical Office, in 2002 the Government owned and operated 22,459 vehicles \nconsisting of 10,913 trucks (MOT: 210), 2,741 buses (MOT Millie buses: 230), and 8,162 cars, \nbut  nearly  all  these  vehicles  no  longer  exist.  According  to  the  Transport  Sector  Review,  the \ncentrally  owned  bus  and  lorry  companies  and  also  the  trolley  bus  service  have  practically \ncollapsed. MOT now has some of the Kamaz freight agencies and the Millie bus agency. MOT \nretains  a  trolley  bus  department,  but  no  vehicles,  workshops,  or  power  supply  network,  which \nhave all been destroyed. \n \n8. \nThe  Afghan  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  dominant  role  in  trucking  and  has \nmaintained its presence, including individuals and firms that relocated in Pakistan during the war \nyears.  As  expected,  long  distance  public  transport,  linking  major  cities  and  neighboring \ncountries, has deteriorated due to road and vehicle conditions as well as suppressed demand \nfor road travel. Security remains a key concern. Urban transport is available, on a limited scale, \nin Kabul and provincial capitals. \n  \n9. \nUrban  transport,  once  dominated  by  the  public  sector,  is  now  mostly  provided  by \nprivately owned buses, taxis, and minivans. Forms of regional transport depend on the state of \nthe roads and the availability of vehicles. People and goods move together, blurring distinction \nbetween  passenger  and  commercial  freight  traffic.  Private  agencies  operate  provincial  and \ndistrict  routes.  Some  165  registered  long-distance  private  bus  companies  are  estimated  to  be \noperating\u2014101  based  in  Kabul,  64  in  provinces\u2014with  a  total  of  14,007  buses,  mostly  old \nminibuses and vans. \n \n10. \nThe taxi system in Afghanistan is widespread and well organized. According to MOT, 24 \ntaxi  unions  registered  in  Kabul  and  27  in  the  provinces  have  a  total  of  29,131  vehicles. \n\n                                                 \n3   International  Monetary  Fund.  2003.  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan:  Rebuilding  a  Macroeconomic  Framework  for \n\nReconstruction and Growth. Washington, DC: IMF. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nRoad Administration \n\nAccording to the Transport Sector Review, the real number of taxis in Kabul is perhaps 30,000. \nTaxis  seem  to  operate  freely,  with  little  adherence  to  zonal  or  any  other  rules.  In  addition, \nintermediate size vehicles of all sizes and shapes also transport passengers and goods. \n \nC.  \n \n11. \nRoad administration is highly centralized. Before the protracted hostilities, the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW), through its 15 departments, was virtually responsible for all government \nconstruction and maintenance, including roads and bridges, airports, public housing, and water \nsupply.  All  aspects  of  planning,  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  were  carried  out  in-\nhouse  through  a  number  of  MPW  construction  units.  Before  1992,  just  one  of  MPW\u2019s \ndepartments,  Road  Construction  and  Development,  had  more  than  5,000  employees.  In \naddition, MPW had a multitude of other responsibilities such as city planning, and collection of \nroad tolls. Theoretically, MPW retains all of these responsibilities. The Ministry of Rehabilitation \nand  Rural  Development  is  responsible  for  development  of  rural  infrastructure,  including  rural \nroads. Construction and maintenance of urban roads are the responsibility of municipalities. \n \n12. \nOver the course of the conflict, the Government ministries lost a majority of their trained \nstaff. In provinces where staff and equipment were retained, they were often under the influence \nof provincial governments and not fully under the control of the ministry headquarters in Kabul. \nThis  situation  is  gradually  being  realigned  as  the  central  Government  successfully  extends  its \ncontrol outside Kabul to provinces. The current staffing level of MPW is about 2,900, of which \n900  are  employed  on  a  permanent  basis,  1,900  are  paid  daily  wages,  and  140  are  military \nofficers. Most of the current staff require substantial skills enhancement to perform their duties. \n \n13. \nTo  fill  the  capacity  gap,  most  of  the  externally  funded  projects  are  being  implemented \nwith  assistance  of  international  consultants  in  project  management.  Civil  works  are  packaged \ninto  large  contracts  and  bid  out  through  competitive  procedures  to  private  sector  contractors. \nConsultants  engaged  by  MPW  supervise  the  works  of  contractors.  MPW  is  being  transformed \ninto  a  lean  and  thin  organization  with  its  primary  task  being  nationwide  policy  formation, \nplanning  of  the  countrywide  road  network,  setting  of  standards  (including  technical,  safety, \nsocial, and environmental safeguards), regulation and enforcement functions, and management \nof roads under its jurisdiction.  \n \n\n \nFigure A2: Current Organizational Structure of Ministry of Public Works \n \n\n \n \n \n\nMinister \n\nDeputy Minister \n\nDirectorate \nof Railways \n\nDirectorate \nof Planning \n\nDirectorate of \nAdministration\n\nDirectorate of \nRoad \nMaintenance\n\nDirectorate of \nRoad Construction \nand Airports\n\nDirectorate of \nSurvey and \nProject Design \n\nDirectorate of \nFinancial \nAdministration\n\nDirectorate of \nAudit and \nController\n\nDirectorate of \nTechnical/ \nMechanical\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n\nD.  \n \nCurrently,  capital  investment  to  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  roads  in  Afghanistan  is \n14. \nmainly  financed  by  external  assistance.  The  current  commitments  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  road \nsubsector by the external bilateral/multilateral funding agencies amount to approximately $1 \nbillion, including $800 million for national primary roads, $130 million for national secondary \nroads,  and  $30  million  for  provincial  roads.  These  commitments  are  mainly  to  rehabilitate \ndamaged roads.  \n \nFor the improvement of the road network, the Government has set a target to double \n15. \nthe share of total paved roads from the present 16% to 32% by 2010, or from the present \n0.15 km of paved roads per 1,000 people to 0.23 km per 1,000 in 2010. To reach this target, \nthe  new  investment  needs  from  2004  to  2010  will  be  for  $4.3  billion  outside  the  existing \ncommitment:  $1.7  billion  for  national  primary  roads,  $1.1  billion  for  national  secondary \nroads,  and  $1.5  billion  for  provincial  roads.4  Considering  the  limited  prospect  for  private \nsector financing of these large investments in the foreseeable future, the public sector will \ncontinue to be responsible for filling the financing gap.  \n \n16. \nAfghanistan  has  a  history  of  toll  collection  for  road  maintenance.  The  first  toll  system \nwas  implemented  in  1974.  Tolls  were  collected  by  way  of  a  system  of  toll  stations  scattered \nthroughout  the  country,  and  the  revenue  was  accrued  to  the  central  revenue  fund  with  no \nearmarking  for  the  road  subsector.  The  allocations  to  the  road  subsector  were  by  way  of \nappropriations  from  the  central  revenue  fund.  A  new  system  implemented  in  1999  introduced \nearmarking  the  funds  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  highways.  MPW  organized  toll \ncollection  and  the  tolls were  viewed  as  a source  of  MPW  revenue.  Through  a  decision  by  the \nHigh Council of Ministers on 23 September 2002, this road toll system was abolished. Private \nparties  had  established  unauthorized  toll  collection  stations  in  a  number  of  locations,  which \ncreated hardships for travelers without contributing to the maintenance program.  \n \n17. \nAt  present,  fuel,  spares,  or  vehicles  area  not  taxed,  except  for  customs  duties.  Some \nfees/levies are charged by the Ministry of Interior and Provincial Finance Department for vehicle \nregistration and renewal.  \n \n18. \nThe Government is in the process of establishing a tax regime. A few more years may \nbe required to fully implement the new tax regime. In the meantime, imposing tolls, in particular \non roads that have recently been rehabilitated, is viewed as an effective way to generate much-\nneeded  revenue  for  road-related  expenditure.  Approximately  $80  million  is  estimated  to  be \nrequired annually to maintain the entire road network. For a country with domestic revenues of \n$300  million,  this  will  be  a  challenge.  The  Government  is  currently  considering  reinstating  toll \ncollection on improved road sections5 to cover the maintenance cost as well as to recover part \nof the capital investment cost.  \n \nE.  \n \n19. \nAs the rehabilitation and reconstruction work progresses, new assets are being created, \nadding  to  the  already  high  demands  for  road  maintenance  activities.  Under  the  ongoing  civil \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n                                                 \n4  Government  of  Afghanistan.  2004.

MPW  plans  to  replicate  its  experience  gained  in  Kabul  to  reforming  the  operation  and \nmaintenance departments in its eight provincial departments. \n \n20. \nAs an asset manager of the national road network, MPW will have limited options: (i) it \ncan  contract  out  large  corridors  to  private  sector  contractors  on  an  annual  or  multiyear \nspecification-based maintenance contract; or (ii) for some strategic locations and to take care of \nemergency  situations,  it  can  use  its  own  fleet  of  maintenance  equipment  and  personnel.  The \nformer arrangement will be combined with toll collection. ADB has been actively supporting the \ngovernment in developing road tolling and maintenance strategy for primary roads.  \n\n                                                \n \n6  Priority  reform  and  restructuring  is  an  institutional  reform  scheme  based  on  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Priority \nReform and Restructuring within Ministries and Government Agencies issued on 12 July 2003, and is administered \nby the Independent Administrative Reforms and Civil Services Commission.  \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \n\n28\n\n Appendix 3 \n\n \n\nProject \n\n \n1.

The country\u2019s mountainous features give rise to high transport costs, leave many \ncommunities  profoundly  isolated,  and  pose  a  challenge  to  nation  building.  Being  land-locked \nadds  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  vulnerability.  An  efficient  transport  sector  will  not  only  reduce  costs  in \ncomparison  with  the  current  situation;  it  is  a  pre-condition  for  strengthening  the  unity  of  the \ncountry, and promoting cohesion and the Afghan identity.  \n \nWith this Policy Statement, the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA) wishes \n2. \nto  chart  a  course  for  the  development  of  the  Afghan  transport  sector  based  on  explicit  policy \nformulations. The Statement represents the first policy document for the transport sector since \nthe  Bonn  Agreement  in  December  2001,  and  supplements  the  National  Development \nFramework.  It  is  viewed  as  an  interim  policy  as  the  current  administration  is  transitional;  it  is \nexpected to be restated once the new administration in terms of the new constitution has come \ninto  power.  Relevant  provisions  of  the  new  constitution  will  be  reflected  in  the  restated  Policy \nStatement  for  the  Transport  Sector.  The  restated  Statement  will  also  incorporate  relevant \nrecommendations  from  the  Civil  Service  and  Privatization  Commissions,  accepted  by \nGovernment.  These  Commissions  were  still  working  on  their  recommendations  at  the  time  of \npreparing this Statement. \n \nThe need for a Policy Statement emanates from the condition that current legislation and \n3. \ninstitutional  arrangements  in  the  public  sector  have  to  a  large  extent  been  shaped  during  the \nperiod  of  occupation  when  foreign  powers  exerted  heavy  influence  on  policy  matters  in \nAfghanistan. The transport sector is hence characterized by heavy reliance on public ownership, \ncentralization  and  archaic  organizational  arrangements  in  the  public  sector.  Production  of \ntransport services is often in the hands of the public sector, and ministries are therefore not only \nengaged in determining policy but also, and more so, in operations and regulation. \n \nThe  current  arrangements  do  not  promote  efficiency  and  often  also  make  it  difficult  to \n4. \neffectively  address  matters  of  public  interest.  The  evidence  may  be  seen  all  over  the  country: \nroads  are  not  being  maintained,  transport  services  are  of  poor  quality,  the  aviation  safety \nsystem does not meet international standards, and road traffic safety is poor by any standards. \nThis  position  is  not  only  a  result  of  the  past  conflicts  and  lack  of  funds;  they  also  derive  from \ninadequate policies and institutional arrangements. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe purposes of this Statement are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTo formulate a long-term vision (10\u201315 years) for the overall development of the \ntransport  sector;  the  realization  of  this  vision  assumes  peaceful  conditions \nprevailing in the country; and \nTo  provide  a  framework  for  the  identification  of  key  actions  required  in  the  first \nphase  for  transforming  the  transport  sector,  encompassing  the  period  up  to  the \nend of year 2008 (1387). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Prepared as part of the Transport Sector Review, and was endorsed by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), \n\nMinistry of Transport (MOT), and Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MCAT) in January 2004. \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nThis Statement will serve as a guideline for the work of TISA and its successor; it is also \n6. \nexpected  that  donors  active  in  the  transport  sector  will  take  it  as  a  guide,  to  ensure  that  their \nsupport achieves maximum development impact, and ultimately the successful reconstruction of \nAfghanistan. \n \n7. \nThe  focus  of  this  Statement  is  on  the  role  and  structure  of  government,  the  role  of  the \nprivate  sector,  and  the  approach  for  how  to  address  public  interest  issues  in  the  transport \nsector. \n \n8. \n \nB. \n \n9. \n \n\nThe basic policy objectives of the Government are to: \n\nAll modes of transport are covered. \n\nThe Basic Policy Objectives \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\npromote economic growth; \neradicate acute poverty; and \nstrengthen national unity. \n\n \n10. \nTo  attain  these  objectives,  resource  utilization  in  the  transport  sector  must  be  radically \nimproved. This will have to be achieved whilst adequately addressing public interest issues such \nas: \n \n\nthe provision of safe and secure transport services; \nthe protection of the environment; \nthe  promotion  of  gender  equality,  attention  to  women  needs  in  transport  and \nparticipation of women in the sector; \nthe improvement in accessibility to rural and urban areas; and \nthe promotion of competition. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n \n\nC. \n\nThe Means to Attain the Objectives \n\n11. \n\n \n\nThe main functions in the transport sector can be identified as follows: \n \n(i) \n\nThe supply of transport services, including intermediate services such as freight \nforwarding, clearing, and other agency services. \nThe provision and preservation of infrastructure. \nThe performance of regulatory activities to address public interest issues. \nThe performance of policy making and overall monitoring of sector development. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \nThe Government\u2019s view is that efficiency in the provision of transport services will best \n12. \nbe  attained by  allowing  competition and  private  sector  participation.  Transport  services  are,  in \ngeneral,  best  produced  subject  to  the  minimum  of  economic  regulation  with  regard  to  entry, \ncapacity and pricing. \n \n13. \nThe  public  sector  has  a  much  more  central  role  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  on \naccount of characteristics that cannot easily be handled by private interests, including high risks, \nnetwork  effects  and  other  external  effects.  However,  the  Government  is  cognizant  of \ninternational experience in relation to arrangements for the planning, provision and operation of \ninfrastructure that may significantly contribute to efficiency. These include: \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  need  for  delegation  of  management  to  autonomous  organizations  within  a \ngovernance framework providing for effective enforcement of accountability. \nThe  importance  of  ensuring  involvement  by  the  users  of  infrastructure  in  the \ngovernance of the organizations charged with management. This may also entail \ndecentralization of the management of infrastructure. \nThe  importance  of  establishing  self-financing  mechanisms  for  the  preservation, \nand also provision, of infrastructure facilities. \nThe  need  to  engage  contractors  by  competitive  tendering  procedures  for  the \nprovision and preservation of infrastructure facilities \n\n \n14. \nThis notwithstanding, the Government recognizes that a market-based approach in the \ntransport  sector  combined  with  autonomous  management  and  self-financing  of  infrastructure \nfacilities, whilst necessary, is not sufficient means to ensure a well-functioning transport sector. \nThere  are  a  number  of  public  interest  issues  to  be  addressed  as  well,  and  these  require \nregulation, which is a domain of the public sector. \n\n \nThe nature of the regulation required varies. Thus, some issues are not simply a concern \n15. \nof the transport sector, but cut across all sectors of the economy. For example certain aspects \nof  environmental  control  relate  to  activities  in  other  sectors  as  well.  And  the  promotion  of \ncompetition  is  a  regulatory  activity,  which  applies  throughout  the  economy;  it  is  therefore  not \nconsidered further here. \n \n16. \nOther issues are exclusive concerns of the transport sector, such as safety, security and \nthe  dimensions  and  environmental  features  of  vehicles  and  aircraft.  Regulatory  activities  in \nthese areas essentially comprise the setting and enforcement of\u2014or the provision of incentives \nto abide by\u2014standards. Regulation is primarily directed towards individuals or companies. \n \n17.  With  regard  to  accessibility  and  gender,  regulation  may  include  standard  setting  and \nenforcement,  but  the  issues  at  hand  may  require  a  more  pro-active  role  by  the  public  sector. \nAccessibility  is  related  to  the  provision  of  transport  and  infrastructure  services  at  affordable \nprices to certain communities, which would be inadequately served by way of a purely market-\nbased  approach.  These  communities,  in  addition,  often  tend  to  be  poor  and  to  live  in  very \nremote areas of the country or in inaccessible parts of urban areas. \n \n18. \n \n\nThe Government\u2019s role with regard to accessibility is threefold: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTo formulate policies and establish standards with regard to accessibility. \nTo identify and establish an institutional framework which can effectively identify \nand  put  in  place  the  means  to  implement  policies  and  improve  and  achieve \nstandards of accessibility. \nTo provide finance to ensure improved accessibility. \n\n \n19. \nRegulatory  activities  with  regard  to  gender  normally  cut  across  all  sectors  in  the \neconomy, for example measures to promote women careers in the public service. But there are \nalso some transport sector dimensions to be noted: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThere are specific enforcement issues with regard to the use by women of taxis, \nbuses and other means of transport, to ensure an equal treatment of both sexes. \nThere is a need to identify and develop transport solutions, which are responsive \nto  the  needs  of  women.  An  implication  of  this  is  that  the  organizations  charged \nwith the management of infrastructure and the provision of solutions for meeting \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 4 \n\naccessibility standards must also review needs from a gender perspective. This \nmay  be  achieved  by  ensuring  women  representation  on  boards  in  agencies \nand/or incorporating appropriate instructions in planning and design manuals. \n\n \nSince  much  regulation  is  of  an  operational  nature,  efficiency  in  performing  regulatory \n20. \nfunctions  can  often  be  achieved  by  delegation  to  autonomous  organizations,  agencies,  which \nperform  their  business  within  a  transparent  governance  framework.  This  applies  e.g.  to  the \nperformance  of  regulatory  functions  to  promote  safety  and  security  in  transport  and \ninfrastructure  operations,  as  well  as  to  improve  the  environment.  It  is  desirable  that  such \norganizations are largely self-financing. It is the Government\u2019s wish to promote the development \nof agencies of this nature. \n \nPolicy formulation, international relations, the drafting of legislation and sector monitoring \n21. \nare obvious functions for the public sector, and indeed the main functions to be performed by a \nministry in the transport sector. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nIn terms of the overall objectives and the means identified to attain these objectives, and \nbased on international experience, the Government has formulated the following vision for the \ntransport sector. \n \n\nThe Long-Term Vision for the Transport Sector \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTransport  services:  Transport  operations  will  be  performed  by  private \noperators,  subject  to  competition.  This  will  apply  to  the  provision  of  taxi,  road \nhaulage  and  bus  transport,  all  intermediate  services  and  air  transport  services. \nSubject  to  international  agreements,  competition  is  also  expected  to  rule  on \ninternational routes, including with respect to air transport, bus transport and road \nhaulage.  Transport  operations  will  normally  be  provided  without  public  subsidy. \nHowever,  certain  domestic  services  may  be  provided  under  public  service \nobligations,  in  order  to  ensure  that  minimum  standards  of  accessibility  in  the \ncountry or urban areas are met. Such public service obligations will be procured \nby competitive tendering. \nRoads:  The  national  road  network  will  have  been  rehabilitated,  and  where \nrequired, upgraded. It will be managed by an autonomous road agency, and its \npreservation and further development financed by road user charges, which are \nnot part of the consolidated budget. Provincial and local roads will be managed \nby provincial and/or local road authorities, and a substantial part of their costs will \nalso  be  financed  by  way  of  road  user  charges.  A  road  fund  will  have  been \nestablished to collect the road user charges and to serve as the procurer of road \nservices from the road agency and local roads authorities, and hence to serve as \nthe  regulator  of  the  road  sector.  Donor  assistance  will  be  directed  towards  the \ndevelopment  of  rural  roads  required  to  improve  accessibility.  Road  works  will \nmainly  be  done  by  contractors, \nfor \nmaintenance.  A  substantial  amount  of  work  will  be  contracted  out  to  small \ncontractors using labor-based techniques. \nAirports  and  the  air  navigation  system:  The  airports  of  the  country  will  be \nmanaged  by  a  number  of  airport  companies.  It  is  expected  that  these,  with  the \nexception of the airport in Kabul, will essentially have provincial ownership. The \nairports  will  be  self-financing  for  their  operations  (but  not  necessarily  for  their \ndevelopment).  The  air  navigation  system  (ANS)  will  be  operated  by  a  separate \ncorporate  self-financing  entity;  it  will  also  operate  the  ANS  at  the  airports. \n\nlong-term  contracts \n\nincluding  under \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nLegislation  establishing  the  airports  and  ANS  corporations  will  enable  the \nfacilities  and  services  to  be  privately  financed  and  operated  in  terms  of  a \nconcession. A system for economic regulation, comprising mainly self-regulatory \narrangements, with regard to the airports and ANS will have been established. \nSafety:  A  new  agency  for  the  regulation  of  safety,  security  and  environmental \nprotection in aviation will have been established. Similarly, the regulation of road \ntraffic with regard to safety and environmental aspects specific to the road sector \nwill have been entrusted to another agency, also expected to handle registration \nof licenses and vehicles. Both as concerns aviation and road traffic, Afghanistan \nwill  regulate  safety  and  security  adequately  in  terms  of  internationally  accepted \nstandards. \nRailways and rivers: Investments in river transport facilities and railways will be \nencouraged.  River  and  railway  transport  developments  will  essentially  be  a \nresponsibility  of  the  private  sector.  The  government  may  participate  in  such \ndevelopments  provided  that  demonstrated  economic  benefits  may  be  derived \ntherefrom, which cannot be captured by private investors, or in order to improve \naccessibility to remote regions in a cost-effective manner. \nOrganization  of  government  in  transport:  A  new  ministry  will  have  been \nestablished,  to  replace  the  current  three  ministries  in  the  transport  sector,  i.e. \nMinistry  of  Transport,  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  and  the  Ministry  of \nPublic  Works  (MPW),  and  will  be  charged  with  policy  work  for  the  road  sector, \nroad transport, multi-modal transport, air transport, and new modes, such as rail \nand river transport. This new ministry will ultimately also be responsible for road \ntraffic (except enforcement), an area which today partly falls under the Ministry of \nInterior, as well as policy matters related to rural roads, which are today handled \nby  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Rehabilitation  and  Development.  The  new  ministry  will \nadditionally have become responsible for international relations and for preparing \nthe  public  budget  in  the  sector.  The  ministry  will  have  a  staff  of  a  couple  of \nthe  new  agencies  and \nhundred  persons.  To  ensure  accountability  of \ncorporations,  an  explicit  governance  regime  will  have  been  put  in  place.  The \ngovernance  regime  will  encompass  objectives  for  these  organizations  that  may \nbe measured, the publication of periodic and annual reports to shed light on the \nattainment  of  the  objectives,  and  arrangements  to  allow  for  the  involvement  of \nusers and other stakeholders. The day-to-day monitoring of these organizations \nwill normally be performed by the new ministry in the transport sector. \n\nShort-Term Conditions \n\n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe  vision  formulated  above  is  ambitious;  it  will  be  a  challenge  to  Afghanistan  to \nrestructure the transport sector accordingly, but to ensure the well being of its citizen\u2019s attempts \nmust  be  made.  In  the  short  run  perspective  it  is  important  to  embark  on  a  process  of  change \nthat will eventually lead towards the realization of the vision. \n \n24. \ninto account: \n \n\nIn the short-term, the Government has decided to also take the following considerations \n\n(i) \n\nPrivatization is not possible in the near future of the national carrier, Ariana, as it \nis loss making. Similarly, in the near future it will not be possible to privatize the \nMinistry of Transport road haulage and bus transport operations, as the country \nhas  received  and  is  receiving  a  substantial  number  of  donated  vehicles.  These \noperations  should,  however,  be  commercialized,  as  a  first  step  towards  later \nprivatization. \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIn international air transport operation there will be a need to offer protection to \nAriana  for  a  period  of  time.  There  are  two  reasons,  viz.  the  need  to  ensure \ninternational  connectivity  given  that  the  aviation  safety  and  security  system  in \nAfghanistan  has  not  been  ICAO  certified,  and  the  modalities  with  regard  to \ninternational aviation in the region. Ariana is, however, expected to be profitable \nand  only  to  serve  routes  not  expected  to  be  loss  making  in  a  medium  term \nperspective.  Also,  the  small  domestic  market,  in  part  on  account  of  the \ninadequate  facilities  at  present,  does  not  lend  itself  to  open  competition  for  the \ntime being, but may provide scope for a regulated system designed to encourage \nthe participation of the private sector. However, air cargo may be liberalized. \nThe country at present does not have an established corps of contractors. Whilst \nconstruction works, and large maintenance contracts may be handled by way of \ninternational contractors, local contractors can for some time only be expected to \nhandle  part  of  the  maintenance  works.  There  will  therefore  be  a  need  for  the \nMPW  to  maintain  limited  force  account  capacity  for  the  time  being  to  perform \n(routine)  road  maintenance  and  also  to  undertake  emergency  repairs  to \nsupplement the capacity of the private sector. \nThe current administrative weakness of the provinces implies that decentralized \nsolutions as concerns e.g. airports and road sector management will have to be \ndelayed for some time. \nFor the time being, the financing arrangements in the road sector are subject to \nagreement  reached  by \nthe \nimplementation of the Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project. \nFundamental restructuring of the ministries is not possible at present. However, \npartial restructuring in terms of the Decree on Priority Reform and Restructuring \nwithin  Ministries  may  be  effected.  This  Decree  allows  for  departments  of \nministries  to  be  given  priority  reform  and  restructuring  (PRR)  status,  so  that \nindividuals  appointed  to  key  posts  in  these  departments  may  be  offered  better \nconditions on a time-limited basis and subject to performance. In addition, in the \nnear  future  the  functions  related  to  (i)  vehicle  registration  and  drivers\u2019  licensing \nshould be transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Transport, (ii) \nairport  airside  infrastructure  should  be  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and (iii) rural roads from the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development to the Ministry of Public Works. \n\nthe  World  Bank  concerning \n\nthe  TISA  with \n\nShort-Term Actions \n\n \nF. \n \n25. \nBased on the above considerations, a number of short term actions\u2014in order to initiate \nreform  of  the  transport  sector\u2014will  be  proposed  by  the  Transport  Sector  Review  for \nimplementation  during  the  period  up  to  the  end  of  2008;  see  the  Action  Plan  of  the  Transport \nSector Review. \n \nG. \n \nThe  Policy  Statement  places  emphasis  on  the  private  sector  in  rebuilding  and \n26. \ndeveloping  the  transport  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  view  is  that  a  key  to  trigger  this \ndevelopment, but also to ensure a balanced approach with adequate attention paid to the public \ninterest issues, is building the capacity of the public sector. The challenge is formidable in view \nof the shortage of skills and the fact that the ministries until recently were steeped in a culture \ninappropriate to the future needs. To be able to move forward, the existing ministries will have to \nbe used as a platform to implement change and reform. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\nThe  following  steps  are  envisaged  by  Government  as  part  of  capacity\u2014including \n\n27. \ninstitution\u2014building: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEach ministry will set up a new department to be charged with capacity building. \nThis capacity building department 2(CBD) is envisaged to be given priority reform \nand  restructuring  (PRR)  status  in  terms  of  the  decree  on  Priority  Reform  and \nRestructuring  within  Ministries.  The  head  of  the  CBD  will  report  to  the  deputy \nminister or the minister. \nEach  CBD  will  be  provided  with  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  team  comprising \nthree types of experts: (i) development of the management and administration of \na  ministry;  (ii)  experts  in  the  specific  functions  of  the  ministry  concerned;  (iii) \nexperts  in  training  in  the  skills  to  be  possessed  by  the  ministry  concerned.  The \nTA team leader will report to the head of the CBD, and on an interim basis to the \nminister/deputy minister. \nThe CBD will design new departments corresponding to the future needs of the \nMinistry.  Once  such  a  department  has  been  designed,  and  key  staff  members \nidentified,  an  application  for  PRR  status  will  be  made,  and  the  department  will \nthen be launched. \nNew  structures,  including  the  envisaged  future  airports  corporations,  ANS \ncorporation, and agencies in aviation, roads and road traffic, will initially also be \nestablished  as  a  new  department,  which  will  be  given  PRR  status.  Once  this \ndepartment has been set up, and basic recruitment completed, the next step will \nbe  prepared  by  the  CBD,  leading  up  to  the  launching  of  the  agency  or \ncorporation, and subsequent closure of the department in question. \nThe CBD will serve as the gender focal point to the Gender Advisory Group, and \nwill be expected to implement a gender operational policy.  \n\nThe Role of Donors \n\nIt  is  expected  that  the  capacity  building  units  can  be  established  in  the  form  of  a \n\n \n28. \ndepartment by the three transport ministries by early 2004 (1383). \n \nH. \n \nThe  Government  expects  donors  to  play  a  key  role  in  supporting  the  reform  of  the \n29. \ntransport sector both in the short and long run as set out in this Policy Statement. Donors are \nencouraged to make reference to this Policy Statement when designing and proposing support \nactivities  to  the  Government.  Donors  are  furthermore  encouraged  to  co-ordinate  their  efforts \nwithin the framework of the Consultative Group of Transport. It is anticipated that this Group will \nprovide a forum for debate on support to the sector, but also serve as a platform for streamlining \ndonors\u2019 approach to the planning of support, as well as procedures for procurement. \n \nDonors  are  particularly  encouraged  to  in  the  shorter  term  lend  their  support  to  the \n30. \nenvisaged capacity building units in the three ministries in the transport sector, as proposed in \nthis  Statement.  In  the  medium  term  donors  can  fruitfully  assist  with  the  establishment  of  new \ncorporations  and  agencies,  including  the  required  governance  framework,  and  the  building  of \ncapacity  to  handle  procurement  and  contract  supervision,  including  labor-based  works.  In  the \nlonger term, a main concern of donors could be to assist with improving accessibility. \n\n                                                \n2  The CBD is referred to as the Reform and Restructuring Office (RRO) in other documents of the Transport Sector \n\n \n\nReview. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nPROJECT ROAD AND SUMMARY OF DESIGN STANDARDS \n\nDescription of the Existing Road. The project road runs through mostly flat terrain with \n\n \n1.  \nshort lengths of hilly terrain.

The design standards proposed for the project road are \nthose  generally  adopted  in  Afghanistan,  which  refer  to  the  AASHTO  Standards.  For  different \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37\n\n \n\n \nterrain conditions, minimum design standards corresponding to the following design speeds are \nadopted:  (i)  flat  terrain  (80  km/hour);  (ii)  rolling  terrain  (60  km/hour);  and  (iii)  mountainous \nterrain(40  km/hour).  The  main  geometric  standards  parameters  are  shown  in  Table  A5.  The \ntypical cross section suggested for the road in flat and rolling terrains is of two traffic lanes, 3.50 \nm wide each, with two hard shoulders of 1.5 m and two verges of 0.5 m, with a total width of \n11.0  m.  In  mountainous  terrain,  in  order  to  reduce  the  construction  cost,  the  typical  cross \nsection suggested is reduced from 10.0 m to 8.0 m, by reducing the width of the shoulders to \n0.5 m. \n\n \nTable A5: Main Parameters of Geometric Design Standards for the Project \n\nDesign Element \n\nUnit \n\nFlat \n\nRolling  Mountainous  Urban \n\nDesign Speed \n\nkm/h \n\n80 \n\nMinimum Stopping Sight Distance \n\n110 \n\nMinimum Passing Sight Distance \n\n275 \n\n225 \n\n125 \n\n175 \n\nMinimum Horizontal Radius \n\n175 \n\n125 \n\nMinimum Horizontal Radius \n(exceptional) \n\n\u2014 \n\n\u2014 \n\nTransition Curves Required \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n60 \n\n85 \n\n8 \n\n\u2014 \n\n7 \n\n\u2014 \n\n2.5 \n\n4 \n\n6 \n\n\u2014 \n\n7 \n\n\u2014 \n\n2.5 \n\n4 \n\n40 \n\n55 \n\n50 \n\n25 \n\n14 \n\n18 \n\n7 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n50 \n\n\u2014 \n\n14 \n\n18 \n\n4 \n\n600 \n\n\u2014 \n\n2.5 \n\n2.5 \n\n4 \n\n4 \n\nMaximum Gradient \n\nMaximum Gradient (exceptional) \n\nMaximum Superelevation \n\nMinimum Vertical Radius \n(exceptional) \n\nTraffic Lane Normal Crossfall \n\nShoulder Normal Crossfall \n\nMinimum Crest Vertical Radius \n\n6,000 \n\n2,500 \n\n1,500 \n\n2,000 \n\nMinimum Sag Vertical Radius \n\n3,000 \n\n2,000 \n\n1,000 \n\n1,000 \n\n       \n \n\n  \u2014 = not available, h = hour, km = kilometer, m = meter . \n \n\nSource: Feasibility study. \n\nM \n\nM \n\nM \n\nM \n\n \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\nM \n\nM \n\n\u2014 \n\n% \n\n% \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES \n($ million) \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nIncremental Project Management Support \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n1.

This  ring  road  adjoins  links  to  border  crossings  into  Afghanistan\u2019  neighboring  countries,  in  turn  forming \npart of a subregional road transport corridor.   \n \nThe  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  road  will  contribute  to  employment  creation,  income  generation  at  the \nhousehold  level,  rehabilitation  of  displaced  persons  and  ex-combatants,  improvement  of  security  and  stability, \ninterethnic reconciliation, and political unification of the country. The Project will utilize, to the extent possible, labor-\nintensive construction methods to provide much-needed employment and income-generation opportunities. Thus, this \ninvestment will significantly improve the socioeconomic situations, and mitigate the pervasive poverty and plight widely \nspread among the resident population and returning migrants. \n \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention           \n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAbout 53% of the population in Afghanistan are classified as poor and live on less than $1 a day.1 The prolonged war \nin  the  country  exacerbated  by  drought  has  severely  affected  the  livelihoods  of  the  local  population.  Decreased  farm \nproductivity and loss of seasonal opportunities for  agricultural  labor is one of the main determinants  of poverty. The \npresent  state  of  infrastructure,  especially  roads,  is  a  severe  constraint  in  the  revival  of  food  security,  livelihood \nopportunities,  provision  of  and  accessibility  to  social  and  economic  services,  and  overall  economic  growth.  An \nestimate  of  poverty  incidence  through  proxy  measures  in  the  project  influence  area  indicates  that  about  35\u201350% \nhouseholds  are poor, and among the poor households  50\u201380%  are living in absolute  poverty. The average monthly \nincome  of  the  poor  households  is  as  low  as  AF3,700  with  the  very  poor  households  being  more  concentrated  in \nFaryab  province.  Most  villages  in  the  project  influence  area  lack  primary  health  care  facilities  or  they  are  located  at \nleast 10 kilometers (km) away from basic health care clinics. Due to absence of primary health care facilities coupled \nwith  poor  condition  of  roads  and  lack  of  transportation  facilities,  the  mortality  rate  was  observed  to  be  high  among \nwomen and children from simple complications of childbirth, lack of proper immunization, and preventable childhood \nillness. Afghanistan ranks 4th highest for the under-5 mortality rate at 257 deaths /1,000 and the infant mortality rate is \nat a high 165/1000.2  \n \nThe direct poverty impact would be from income generation and demand for unskilled labor resulting directly from road \nconstruction. The estimated cost of unskilled labor for constructing the project road is 6% of the total civil works, and \nthe  wages  accruing  to  unskilled  labor  is  calculated  as  AF10  million.  The  improved  road  will  significantly  reduce \ntransport  cost  and  travel  time.  This  will  translate  into  improved  access  to  schools,  medical  clinics,  and  employment \ncenters. Further, the improved road would decrease the chances of accident deaths and disabilities that have resulted \nfrom  extremely  poor  road  conditions.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  (0.69)  indicates  that  the  poor  will  receive  a  high \nproportion of these benefits. The indirect, but important impact will be the growth of local trade, production activities, \nand  reduced  prices  of  commodities  facilitated  by  improved  access  to  local,  national,  and  international  markets.  The \nroad  improvement  is  also  expected  to  mainstream  local  economies  with  the  overall  national  economy,  and  facilitate \nexploitation of available natural resources, such as minerals, gas, and other resources. These benefits are expected to \nsignificantly increase household incomes and quality of life, and reduce the overall poverty incidence.  \n \n\n                                                                  \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Apart  from  the  public  meetings,  focus \ngroup  discussions  were  organized  with  different  segments  of  the  population  (young,  old,  men,  and  women  from \ndifferent occupations and population groups) during the survey. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIncidence of poverty among women is higher compared with men and is characterized by low endowment of land and \nproductive  assets,  unemployment,  discrimination  in  the  labor  market,  and  limited  access  to  economic  options  and \npolitical processes. Women in Afghanistan are generally denied inheritance rights, adequate food and nutrition, choice \nof education, and participation in the decision-making process of household economic activities. The level of education \nattainment in elementary schools in the project area ranges between 12\u201336% for females compared with 62\u201377% for \nmales.  However,  with  the  recent  appreciation  for  education  for  women  and  changing  socioeconomic  realities, \nespecially due to the increased number of households headed by women, consequent to loss of male members, the \nrole of women in economic activities is slowly beginning to be acceptable. Although, women will not benefit from direct \nemployment opportunities  working on the construction of the highway, but will benefit from reduced travel times and \ntransport costs. With the improved road, combined with increased availability of transport services, women will find it \neasier to reach schools, clinics, and hospitals, other market centers, and, if needed, to district and provincial capitals.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.

However,  after \nfinalization  of  detailed  design  during  implementation,  if \nresettlement  impacts  are  identified,  resettlement  plans  will \nbe  prepared  as  per  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement. This is addressed in the \nloan assurances. \n \nThe reduction in travel time and transport costs is expected \nto  result  in  reduced  transport  service  charges  and  improve \naffordability of the transport services in the project area.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/\nNone \n Significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\n Not \nsignificant \n \n\n None \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n\n \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 11 \n\nItem \n\nLabor \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/\nNone \n Significant \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nTo the extent possible, the Project will utilize labor-intensive \nconstruction  methods  to  provide  employment  and  income \ngeneration  opportunities.

Although the Asian Development Bank (ADB) finances a portion of the section \nof about 210 kilometers (km), the remainder of the section will be constructed in parallel using \nother financing sources. This is considered reasonable as the benefits are mainly expected to \nbe accrued to the generated and induced traffic with the completion of the overall section. The \nanalysis  used  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  (HDM4)  with  modification  for \nconditions  in  Afghanistan.  Data  under  the  same  conditions  in  neighboring  countries  were \nadopted for unavailable input data. Economic evaluation was made by comparing two cases of \nwith and without the Project. The case without the Project reflects the current practice of doing-\nnothing but keeping passability at the existing level. \n \n2. \nThe project road was evaluated up to and including 2027, providing a benefit period of \n20 years. A residual value of 10% was applied in 2027. The improved road will reduce operating \ncosts and travel time, which will lead to a stimulus in economic growth in the project area. All \nbenefits and costs are expressed in 2004 constant prices. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nHomogeneous  sections  are  defined  based  on  traffic  volumes  derived  from  the  traffic \nanalysis, road geometry, and roughness observed during the surveys, and altitude and gradient \nof the road.

Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes, \nand  duties.  Taxes  and  duties  in  Afghanistan  are  virtually  zero  at  present.  Following  the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, a factor of 0.9 was used to \nconvert financial rehabilitation and maintenance costs to economic costs. \n \n8. \nThree  alternative  pavement  standards  were  considered:  Double  Bitumen  Surface \nTreatment (DBST) (Alt 1); AC 50mm on granular base (alt 2); and AC 90mm on granular base \n(Alt 3). The project road cost estimates in economic terms are shown in Table A12.5. \n \n\nTable A12.5: Economic Construction Costs  \n($) \n\n \n\nLength \n(km) \n\n554 \n\nAlternative 1:  \nDense Bituminous  \nSurface Treatment \n225,683,157 \n\nAlternative 2:  \nAsphalt Concrete 50 mm\n\nAlternative 3:  \nAsphalt Concrete 90 mm\n\n252,234,269 \n\n256,075,332 \n\n  km = kilometer, mm = millimeter.          \n  Source: Asian Development Bank and consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n9. \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in vehicle operating \ncosts and (ii) savings in travel time. Vehicle operating cost savings were calculated using HDM4 \nfor each vehicle type. Following the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \nProject,  value  of  time  per  vehicle is  estimated at  $0.38  plus  $0.13  per  passengers,  and  $0.50 \nper truck plus $0.25 per passenger. The benefits for generated traffic are considered to be 50% \nof those for the normal traffic. \n \n\n3.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n10. \nAn  economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  by  section  for  the  three  alternatives.  The \nmaintenance standard for the do-nothing case is spot-gravelling every year to keep the surface \ncondition  at  the  minimum  level  of  SPELL  (IRI)  =  15.  For  the  with  project  case,  overlay  is \nconduced when the surface roughness of the road reaches IRI 5 m/km for alternatives 2 and 3. \nFor alternative 1, overlay is conducted when the roughness reaches IRI 9 m/km. \n \n11. \nThe calculation of the economic internal rate of return of the overall project road results \nin 17.4%, 18.4%, and 19.1% for alternatives 1, 2, and 3, respectively, considering the savings \nfrom vehicle operating costs  and travel as benefits. Alternative 3 (AC 90mm) was found to be \nthe least cost design, considering the life-cycle costs.

The \nfollowing is the assessment based on this study. A follow-up study is currently being undertaken \nand the assessment will be updated with use of the follow-up study. \n \n14. \nRegarding competition among individual firms in the freight sector, a significant degree \nof competition is available for the hauling business. Research indicates that a significant drop in \nfreight rates was realized for World Food Program freight over 6 months. The freight forwarding \ncompany takes a percentage (5\u201310%) of the contract price, passing the rest on to the driver.  \n \n15. \nIn the passenger transport sector, competition is relatively less. Bus drivers pay a fee to \nthe  cooperative  for  one  passenger  fare  for  the  larger  buses  and  60%  of  one  fare  for  taxi  and \nsmaller  buses.  It  was  not  clear  whether  this  requirement  was  enforced  by  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  or  by  the  leadership  of  the  cooperative  and  whether  the  collectives  have  records  of \nthe accounts. A fixed rotation system is used; the driver is given a number and must wait for all \nof the drivers holding prior numbers to get a load of passengers before he becomes eligible for \na  trip.  This  fixed  rotation  prevents  individual  operators  from  competing  with  one  another  on \neither price or service. Because of this limit to competition, price of passenger transport could \nbe  held  above  the  open  competition  price.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  also  intervenes  in  this \nmarket by setting an official passenger tariff. Normally passenger transporters must pay 0.2% of \ntheir combined passenger fares at their first Ministry of Transport fee collection. However, tariff \ncollection is not very standardized, which is an important weakness in the system. \n \nBased  on  the  assessment  of  the  project  area,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  for  the  overall \n16. \nProject  is  estimated  to  be  0.69.  This  high  level  indicates  that  the  poor  will  receive  a  high \nproportion of benefits. Detailed analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nA. \n \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  in  accordance with  the  Asian  Development \n1. \nBank  (ADB)  Guidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment.  An  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE)  was  prepared.  This  appendix  is  based  on  the  information  in  the  IEE  and  summary  IEE \nreports undertaken under the project preparatory technical assistance1 on behalf of the Ministry \nof Public Works.  \n \nB. \n \nThe Andkhoy-Qaisar road is a segment of the ring road, which connects the major cities \n2. \nof  Afghanistan.  The  Project  will  involve  (i)  reconstruction  and  improvement  of  a  210  kilometer \n(km) road section; (ii) improvement of about 10 river crossings on the 210 km stretch; and (iii) \nprovision of markings, signs, and other safety features. The improvement and reconstruction of \nthe road aims to achieve a design standard with the following typical cross section: (i) in flat and \nrolling terrain:, two traffic lanes each 3.5 meters (m) wide, with two hard shoulders each 1.5 m \nwide  each,  and  two  verges  0.5  m  wide,  with  a  total  width  of  11.0  m;  and  (ii)  in  mountainous \nterrain: the same traffic lanes with hard shoulders reduced to 0.5 m, with a total width of 8.0 m. \n  \nC. \n \n3. \nproject area along the road is briefly summarized here. \n \n\nThe Project is administratively located within Faryab. The environmental condition of the \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n \nThe road passes through different topography from north to southwest. From Andkhoy to \n4. \nDaulatabad  (61  km),  the  terrain  is  an  open  plain  with  gentle  slope.  The  elevation  of  this  area \nranges  from  320  to  400  m  above  sea  level.  The  open  plain  continues  along  the  Shirin  Tagab \nRiver  up  to  a  point  113  km  away  from  Andkhoy,  at  an  elevation  of  750  m.  Thereafter  a  short \nsection of hilly terrain continues to Maimana (129 km from Andkhoy at an elevation of 866 m). \nAfter Maimana, the terrain becomes gentle and elevations stay between 840 and 940 m except \nthe last 23 km to Qaisar. After Qaisar (187 km from Andkhoy at an elevation of 1,340 m), the \nproject  road  runs  along  the  Qaisar  River  and  ends  at  a  point  before  a  small  settlement  called \nKhazara Qala (210 km from Andkhoy) in Qaisar District.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Environment \n\n \nOnly  4%  of  Afghanistan  is  forested,  mostly  in  the  east  and  southeast.  The  deciduous \n5. \nforests  have  almost  completely  disappeared,  as  have  almost  95%  of  the  juniper  forests.  The \nvegetation along the corridor of the project road is primarily semidesert, which mainly consists of \nresistant  grasses,  various  shrubs  such  as  tamarisk,  and  sand  acacia.  The  irrigated  areas  are \nmostly planted with grains, wheat, and other crops. Orchards and vineyards are common in the \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Preparing the Herat-Andkhoy Road Project. Manila. The IEE report was prepared for 553 km road, but \nADB\u2019s project will cover road improvement of the first 210 km from Andkhoy . Therefore, this summary focuses only \non the area covered by the proposed ADB\u2019s project.   \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nvillages.  Wheat;  barley;  corn;  potatoes;  vegetables;  and  fruits  such  as  grape,  melon,  and \nwatermelon, dominate the vegetation in the villages along the existing road. In the valley, acacia \nand  pistachio  plantations  are  commonly  found.  However,  the  project  area  has  no  special \nspecies to be considered for preservation.  \n \n6. \nWith regard to the fauna in the project area, several domestic animals such as camels, \nhorses,  donkey,  cows,  buffalo,  sheep,  and  goats,  as  well  as  dogs  used  as  shepherds  were \nidentified. Several types of birds are found in the project area.   \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe environmental impacts associated with the construction stage include (i) disruption \nof  traffic  in  the  construction  area,  (ii)  increased  air  pollution  due  to  increasing  dust  and  other \nvolatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, (iv) disruption of the \nwater system due to construction of bridges and other earth work particularly in the valley areas, \nand (v) potential landslides associated with elevating some part of the road. These impacts will \nall  occur  only  during  the  construction  period.  Mitigation  measures  to  minimize  these  impacts \ninclude (i) rerouting traffic with clear signs; (ii) maintaining optimum moisture content during soil \nhandling, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining a safe distance between the asphalt \nplant and public facilities including education facilities; (iii) strictly controlling construction works \nthat create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in residential areas; (iv) locating the hot-\nmix  and  crusher  plants  at  least  1  km  from  residential  areas;  (v)  pumping  stagnant  water,  and \nproviding adequate drainage system; and (vi) stabilizing road embankment side slopes. These \nmeasures  will  be  included  in  the  contract  document  for  the  civil  works.  These  impacts  are  all \ntemporary and manageable. \n \n8. \nCamps  for  construction  works  will  be  established  in  areas  that  are  not  prone  to  social \nconflicts.  The  camps  will  need  to  be  complete  with  adequate  sanitation  facilities  and  waste \nmanagement  to  avoid  disturbance  to  the  communities.  Construction  materials  that  contain \nhazardous  and  toxic  substances  such  as  petroleum,  and  asphalt  should  be  stored  in  proper \nplaces and managed in accordance with the relevant international standards.   \n \nThe environmental impact associated with the operation of the Project is mainly on traffic \n9. \nsafety, therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical barriers to reduce motorist speed must be \nprovided . This measure needs to be strictly enforced particularly in villages and towns along the \nroad corridor, where markets usually take place.  \n  \nE. \n \n10. \nInstitutional  Framework  and  Responsibility.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures \nduring construction will be the responsibility of the contractor. An environmental engineer, who \nwill  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  team  to  implement  the  Project,  will  help  the  Ministry  of \nPublic Work (MPW) prepare contractual documentation so that the bidding documents, bills of \nquantity,  and  other  contractual  obligations  of  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental \nresponsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  noncompliance.  MPW  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing overall environmental monitoring and management as part of the IEE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n \n\n11. \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  and  Management  Plan.  The  IEE  identified  the  generic \nmonitoring and management program, which will be part of mitigating adverse impacts. Annual \nreports  in  implementing  the  monitoring  and  management  plan  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and \nother relevant Government agencies. \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nF. \n \n12. \nThe  IEE  study  shows  that  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  Project  are \nmanageable and can be mitigated. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment to assess \nfurther impacts of roads involved in this Project is not required.  \n \nG.  \n \nPublic consultation during the preparation of the IEE was done in a very informal manner \n13. \nwith the population living along the road project. In general, consulted communities did not show \nany objection to the proposed improvement, and did not have any particular concerns about the \npotential  impacts  associated  with  the  Project.  Therefore,  MPW  should  carry  out  a  public \nconsultation during project implementation, particularly prior to the start of the construction. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nH.  \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project will improve existing roads. The overall IEE finding is that the Project will not \n14. \ncause  significant  environmental  problems  and  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable. \nHowever, continued monitoring should be carried out. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2004) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "\u2013  afghani/s (AF) \n", "AF1.00\n$1.00\n", "=  $0.0219 \n=  AF45.70 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nAIDS \nARDS \nEIRRP \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Asian Development Fund \n\u2013  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  \n\u2013  Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services \n\u2013  Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and \n", "HIV \nICB \nIEE \nMOT \nMPW \nPMU \nPRR \nTA \nUN \n", "Reconstruction Project \n", "\u2013  human immunodeficiency virus  \ninternational competitive bidding \n\u2013 \ninitial environmental examination  \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Transport \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works \n\u2013  project management unit \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations \n", "priority reform and restructuring \ntechnical assistance  \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km \nkm2 \nm \n", "kilometer \nsquare kilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  meter \n", " \n \n \nNOTE \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  H.
