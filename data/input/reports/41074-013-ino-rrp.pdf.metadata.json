A  145-kilometer  (km)  new \ndistribution line, distribution feeder extensions, and a new substation will improve the reliability \nof power supply in West Kalimantan. An 83 km cross-border high-voltage transmission line and \na substation will be part of the overall transmission link on the Indonesian side to connect the \nWest Kalimantan power grid to the power grid of neighboring Sarawak (Malaysia), thus enabling \npower  exchange  of  about  230  megawatts  (MW)  between  the  two  systems.  ADB  is  preparing \npart  of  the  transmission  link  on  the  Malaysian  side  as  a  separate  nonsovereign  loan financed \nproject for the state-owned power utility in Sarawak, Malaysia.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe proposed project will reduce the cost of operating the power system in West \nKalimantan. Oil is one of the most expensive power generation fuels accounting for a quarter of \npower  generation  in  Indonesia  and  all  power  generation  in  West  Kalimantan;  hence,  the \naverage  cost  of  power  generation  is  about  $0.25  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).4  Coal,  an  abundant \nlocal5 undeveloped resource is a substitute fuel for oil, with costs below $0.10/kWh.6 However, \nas developing these coal resources will take time (7\u201310 years), and West Kalimantan urgently \nneeds additional electricity supply to meet growing needs, West Kalimantan considers access to \ncross-border power supply a priority to meet rising demand and at reduced costs. The proposed \ninterconnection with Sarawak at a negotiated import price of $0.10 kWh will enable Indonesia's \nPLN to import 230 MW equivalent of power generation to the West Kalimantan grid by January \n2015. This will enable PLN to enhance its least-cost generation plan by combining hydropower \nimports  from  Sarawak  with  other  Indonesian  base-load  generation  from  oil  or  coal.  The \nproposed  power  imports  may  further  reduce  power  generation  costs  in  the  future  as  Sarawak \nplans to develop more hydropower for an average power generation cost below $0.10/kWh.  \n \n4. \n The  West  Kalimantan  system  demand  will  grow  to  about  600  MW  by  2020,  from \nabout 200 MW in 2012, and in the absence of the proposed interconnection, PLN plans to build \nnew  coal  generation  to  switch  from  the  rented  oil  generators  that  PLN  now  uses.  The \n\n                                                \n1   Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n2   State Electricity Corporation. \n3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB provided technical assistance for the  preparation of \nthe  project.  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  for  Efficiency  Improvement  and  Connectivity  Strengthening  in \nArchipelagic Southeast Asia Project. Manila (TA 6441-REG). \n\n4   About 3 times more than the average cost of generation by other power systems in Southeast Asia.  \n5   Indonesia  is  a  lead  coal  exporter:  About  50%  of  reserve  in  Kalimantan  (34%  in  East  Kalimantan,  16%  in  South \n\nKalimantan, and about 3% in West Kalimantan). \n\n6   In  December  2011,  PLN  signed  an  independent  power  producer  contract  for  2  x  25  MW  at  $0.0909/kWh  for \n25 years.  Government  of  Indonesia,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources.  http://www.esdm.go.id/news-\narchives/electricity/46-electricity/5252-pln-signed-ipp-contract-pltu-pontianak-3.html  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ninterconnection has always been an alternative option to meet long term system demand., The \npower utilities in the island of Borneo have been planning a 1,300 km long high-voltage power \ntransmission  link,  the  Trans  Borneo  Power  Grid,  to  connect  the  West  Kalimantan  power  grid \nacross  Sarawak,  Brunei  Darussalam,  to  Sabah  and  enable  power  exchanges  between  the \nBIMP-EAGA  countries.7  This  transmission  system  development  will  help  each  area  take \nadvantage of the different power systems and different power generation mixes on the island of \nBorneo: West Kalimantan relies almost entirely on oil, Sarawak largely on hydropower, Brunei \nDarussalam on gas, and Sabah predominantly on diesel and fuel oil.  \n \n5. \nReduced carbon footprint. Currently PLN relies entirely on oil for power generation in \nWest Kalimantan. As PLN will eventually stop using expensive oil-based power generation, the \noverall  carbon footprint  of  Borneo will  be  reduced.  The  power  interconnection  will  benefit  also \nboth West Kalimantan and Sarawak directly. A base-load supply of 50 MW and about 180 MW \nfor 6 hours a day will amount to about 650,000 megawatt-hours of import of cheaper power from \nSarawak  to  West  Kalimantan  each  year,  at  a  negotiated  import  price  of  $0.10/kWh\u2014annually \nPLN  as  the  buyer  will  save  about  $100  million  by  avoiding  oil  generation  and Sarawak  as the \nseller  will  earn  about  $33  million  with  its  low-cost  power  generation.  This  will  also  create \nopportunities for future power exports and sharing of system reserve margins between the two \ncountries enabling further reduction of carbon footprint. \n \nThe  proposed  interconnection  with  Sarawak  is  of  strategic  importance  to  PLN. \n6. \nWith  the  experience  of  this  interconnection,  PLN  plans  to  expand  its  power  exchange \narrangements  with  its  neighbors,  although  the  West  Kalimantan  system  is  relatively  small \ncompared  with  the  Indonesian  system:  in  2012,  demand  for  power  from  the West  Kalimantan \nsystem  was  about  200  MW  compared  with  total  Indonesian  system  demand  of  about  30,000 \nMW;  and the  proposed  83 km  long  275-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  is  relatively  small\u2014PLN \nplans to build about 50,000 km of transmission lines over the next 10 years, including 5,000 km \nof 275 kV lines.  \n \n7. \nSigned  power  exchange  agreement.  On  5  September  2012,  PLN  and  Syarikat \nSESCO  confirmed  their commitment  to the  project  by  signing the  power  exchange agreement \n(PEA) based on the term sheet signed on 18 July 2011. The PEA is for 20 years: the first phase \ncovering the first 5 years has take-or-pay and take-and-pay prices.8 The second-phase duration \ncould be for long term, medium term, or short term within a maximum capacity of 230 MW. The \nPEA  covers  purchase  of  about  50  MW  of  capacity  as  base  load  on  a  take-or-pay  basis  for \n5 years. In addition, PLN will be able to purchase another 180 MW  of capacity as a take-and-\npay  contract.  Both  parties  secured  their  performance  obligations  with  bank  guarantees  of \n$35 million  to  each  other.  The  parties  agreed  also  to  enter  into  an  interconnection  agreement \nbefore  30 June  2013.  The  PEA  includes  strict  milestone  schedules\u2014(grid  completion:  31 \nDecember 2014, and supply start: 1 January 2015) in order to avoid paying the $25,000-a-day \npenalty  to  each  other.  PLN  has  awarded  contracts  for  four  main  packages  and  have  signed \nthese contracts under the approved advanced procurement action.  \n  \n8. \nADB\u2019s continued support for regional cooperation. The project is aligned with ADB's \nenergy  sector  assessment  strategy  and  road  map9  and  the  BIMP-EAGA  implementation \n\n                                                \n7  BIMP-EAGA refers to the subregional initiative covering Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East \n\nASEAN Growth Area (http://www.bimp-eaga.org/). \n\n8   Take-or-pay amounts are like capacity payments: payments for full amounts have to be made even if only a portion \n\nof the contract amount is consumed. Take-and-pay allows the buyer to pay only for the amounts used.  \n\n9   Sector Assessment: Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nblueprint,10 which made improving infrastructure facilities a priority and power interconnection a \nkey  strategic  pillar. The project  is  also  in  line  with  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN)  Connectivity  Plan.11  ADB  supports  investment  in  strategic  transmission  assets  that \nconnects regions or countries to optimize power networks by removing transmission bottlenecks \nand  transmitting  cheaper  power  from  one  area  to  the  other,  thereby  helping  achieve  overall \nregional socioeconomic and environmental improvement. This project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u2013201412 and country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014,13 \nwhich  support  the  government's  economic  growth  target  of  6.3%\u20136.8%  per  annum  in  2010\u2013\n2014  and  to  reach  7%  beyond  2014  despite  protracted  global  recovery.  Furthermore,  ADB  is \nnow  working  with  PLN  on  the  Sumatra\u2013Peninsular  Malaysia  power  interconnection  (250  km, \n500 kV,  high-voltage direct  current  line for the  sharing  of  power  between Indonesia (Sumatra) \nand Peninsular Malaysia. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be sustainable power supply in West Kalimantan and the outcome will be \n\n9. \nthe reduced cost of operating the power system in West Kalimantan.  \n  \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  construction  of  about  83  km  of  275  kV  double-\n10. \ncircuit  transmission  line  between  Bengkayang  and  the  border  with  Sarawak,  with  a  new \n275/150/20 kV  substation  in  Bengkayang; (ii)  construction  of  about  145 km  of  150 kV  double-\ncircuit  Bengkayang\u2013Ngabang\u2013Tayan  distribution  line,  with  a  new  150/250  kV  substation  in \nNgabang  and  a  four-line  distribution  feeder  extension  for  the  150  kV  Tayan  substation  and \nBengkayang substation; and (iii) new connections to 8,000 households in West Kalimantan.  \n  \n11. \nA large proportion of the population has no access to grid-connected electricity, and at \nany  given  time  a  large  number  of  customers  are  in  the  queue  for  connection  in  West \nKalimantan. Because of power supply shortages and lack of funds for investing in low-voltage \ndistribution,  PLN  is  unable  to  meet  the  demand  for  new  connections.  The  proposed  new \nhousehold  connections  (output  3)  will  reduce  the  connection  charges  and  connection  time \nthrough a single initiative for the communities living between Bengkayang and Sarawak border. \nThe connection charge varies from $35 to about $100 depending on the size of the connection \n(450\u20131,300  volt-amperes).  About  8,000  households  will  also  benefit  from  training  on  energy \nefficiency,  provision  of  energy-efficient  lighting,  and  improved  local  community  centers \n(hospitals and schools). With access to electricity, these households  will have access to other \neconomic  opportunities,  improve  their  livelihood,  and  stop  using  kerosene  or  oil  lamps  for \nlighting. This will contribute to ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative to increase access to modern forms \nof  energy.14  PLN  will  use  its  $2  million,  a  part  of  its  counterpart  funds,  together  with  the  $2 \nmillion grant to support the necessary upgrade of low-voltage systems. ADB will work with PLN \nto determine the beneficiaries of output 3.15 The details will be finalized during inception of the \nproject.  \n \n\n                                                \n10  BIMP-EAGA. 2012.

This  will  cover  tendering  and  bid  evaluation  up  to  the  stage  of  ADB\u2019s  approval  of \nPLN\u2019s  recommendation  for  award  of  contract  before  the  effective  date  of  the  loan  and  project \nagreements.  The  government  and  PLN  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance \ncontracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  proposed  loan  and  that  ADB  financing  will  \ndepend  on  the  government's  compliance  with  all  aspects  of  ADB's  procedural  requirements, \nincluding compliance with the relevant provisions of the loan and project agreements and ADB's \nguidelines.  PLN\u2019s  procurement  for  the  275  kV  transmission  line  and  substation  are  quite \nadvanced under the advance contracting approved by ADB in August 2011. Four international \ncompetitive bidding packages have been bid out in August 2012 and PLN has signed contracts \nfor three of the four packages as of 11 June 2013 with a total value of about $68 million.  \n \n19. \nADB  will  finance  expenditures  for  the  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting \nservices  paid  for  by  PLN  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  loan  agreement,  provided  such \nexpenditures  were  incurred  with  the  concurrence  of  ADB.  Retroactive  finance  will  cover  the \nmaximum  amount  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  the  equivalent  of  20%  of  the  total  ADB  loan, \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. The AFD loan will have the same retroactive financing provisions.  \n \n20. \nThe  project  will  procure  four  contract  packages  under  international  competitive  bidding \nunder  the  loan  component.  The  grant  component  (access  to  power)  will  have  one  distribution \nline  contract  package  under  PLN  financing,  one  international  competitive  bidding  package  for \ncivil  works  with  associated  goods,  and  consulting  services.  Details  are  provided  in  the \nprocurement plan (footnote 16). \n \n\n2.  \n\nImplementation Consultants \n\n21. \nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  manage  the  implementation  of  the \nproject, especially the 275 kV cross-border transmission component. The firm will deliver a total \nof  206  person-months  of  consulting  services  (28  person-months  of  international  and \n178 person-months  of  national  consulting  inputs)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  (QCBS)  method  with  a  80:20  ratio  and  using  a  full  technical  proposal.  The  grant \ncomponent  will  require  24  person-months  of  consulting  services  (10  person-months  of \ninternational  and  14  person-months  of  national  consultants)  to  be  engaged  intermittently.  The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in the project administration manual (footnote 16).  \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nA. \n \nADB  staff  has  reviewed  the  project  preparatory  studies  and  confirmed  the  technical \n22. \nproject  design.  The  double-circuit  Mambong\u2013Bengkayang  275  kV \nline \ninterconnection  takes  into  account  maintenance  of  the  largest  generating  unit  in  the  West \nKalimantan system and the need to import additional power from Sarawak to West Kalimantan \nto ensure the N-1 reliability contingency17 during operation. As most of the existing power plants \nin the West Kalimantan system will be retired by 2017, the power import to West Kalimantan as \nproposed is feasible under normal (N) and single contingency (N-1) conditions. Currently, PLN \ndoes not have an appropriate control center in Pontianak. Until the control center in Pontianak is \nready, the 275 kV transmission line will be operated and controlled from Kuching. The technical \nteams of PLN and Sarawak Energy will have to agree on a standard operating practice.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\ntransmission \n\n23. \nFinancial  and  economic  benefits  were  calculated  on  the  basis  of  imported  power, \nreplacing expensive oil-fired power generation. The cost estimates are in constant 2012 prices. \nPLN\u2019s recent project costs and consultants confirmation are the basis of these cost estimates.  \n \n24. \nThe FIRR is 30%, based on a cash flow for 20 years, which is higher than the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.1%,  making  the  project  financially  viable.  This  project  has  a  high \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) because the financial benefits include, in addition to the \nbenefit  of  wheeling  electricity,  the  direct  benefit  of  importing  power  at  a  lower  price  from \nSarawak  enabling  PLN  and  avoid  expensive  power  generated  by  burning  oil  in  West \nKalimantan.    The  benefit  calculation  is  based  on  a  range  of  power  purchase  and  off-take \nscenarios: the base-case scenario assumes that only 50 MW will be take-and-pay for off-peak \ntime for the first 5 years, and only 50 MW will be purchased as base load after the first 5 years \nof  contract  at  a  25%  higher  tariff. The  high-case  scenario  assumes that 100 MW  will  be  take-\nand-pay for the first 5 years and same capacity will be purchased by PLN at a price 15% higher \nfor the next 5 years, while the low-case scenario assumes that no take-and-pay and no power \npurchase will occur after the first 5 years. For the base case, the FIRR is 30% and the economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  52%.  The  FIRR  varies  from  17.7%  to  42.0%  for  the  different \nscenarios. The EIRR ranges from 32% to 70%, and the net present value is $243 million (base \ncase) over the life of the project.18  \n \nC. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PLN. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.  To  ensure  transparency  and  good \ngovernance,  PLN  will  publicly  disclose  on  its  website  information  on  how  loan  proceeds  are \nbeing used. For each procurement contract, PLN will disclose (i) the list of participating bidders, \n(ii)  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (iii)  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  (iv)  the \namount  of  the  contract  awarded,  (v)  a  list  of  goods  and  services  purchased,  and  (vi)  the \nintended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each  contract  being  awarded.  ADB  will \n                                                \n17 The  system is planned such that, with all  transmission  facilities in service, the system  is  in  a secure state, and     \n      for any one credible contingency event, the system moves to a satisfactory stage. Beyond that the load may have    \n\nGovernance \n\n    to be shed.

However,  the  grant \ncomponent  will  extend  project  benefits  to  the  households  in  the  project  area.  In  addition  to \nconnecting  new  households,  it  will  improve  supply  reliability  (i.e.,  fewer  blackouts).  Local \ncommunities  will  also  be  able  to  work  in  project  construction  and  maintenance  activities. \nIndustrial  growth,  especially  in  rubber  factories,  and  increased  trading  activities  with  reliable \npower  supply  will  create  jobs,  especially  for  low-income  groups.  The  basic  public  services\u2014\neducation, health, and water supply\u2014will improve because of access to electricity. The project \nwill  benefit  the  minority  households  in  the  neighborhoods  of  the  Benkawang  substation  to the \nborder of Sarawak. There are no gender measures in the project. The project will not have any \nadverse  impact  on  women  and/or  girls,  or  widen  gender  inequality.  Due  diligence  did  not \nhighlight specific gender issues, as transmission projects are, by their nature, unlikely to provide \nopportunity for gender design; however, there will be direct and substantial benefits to women \nfrom better electricity supply. The benefits from electricity will accrue largely in the form of labor \nsavings,  greater  social  interaction,  and  broader  options  for  work  and  other  activities.  The \nresettlement  plans  for  the  project  include  specific  actions  to  ensure  that  women  are  included \neffectively  in  the  land  acquisition  process  (e.g.,  poor  women  and  households  headed  by \nwomen).  A  social  impact  assessment19  has  been  prepared  to  examine  key  aspects  such  as \npoverty, vulnerability, education, health, ethnicity, and gender.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards  \n\nEnvironment. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project \n27. \nhas  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  requiring  the  preparation  of  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  which  has  been  approved  by  PLN  and ADB  and  disclosed  on  the \nADB  website  on  August  2011.  The  proposed  transmission  line  will  pass  along  existing  roads \nand the transmission corridor is limited to areas affected by human presence with agriculture as \nthe  principal  land  use.  Use  of  good  international  construction  practices  during  implementation \nwill  mitigate  some  of  the  temporary  impacts,  including,  vegetation  clearing,  soil  erosion, \ndrainage,  effects  on  water  and  air  quality,  waste  management,  additional  demand  on \ninfrastructure,  hunting  and  fuel  wood  collection  by  workers,  and  occupational  and  community \nhealth and safety  issues.  Neither the  275 kV  transmission  line  nor  the  150  kV distribution  line \nenters  any  protected  and  primary  forests,  wetlands,  or  areas  identified  as  having  special \necological significance or cultural heritage sites. The closest the 275 kV transmission line comes \nto  a  protected  forest  is  about  2 km;  north  of  Tayan,  the  150  kV  distribution  line  passes  at  a \ndistance of 500\u2013800 meters to the Gunung Condong protected forest, which will be designated \nas \u201cno go\u201d area to be strictly off-limit for all workers.  \n \nThe  final  alignment  will  be  fine-tuned  to  minimize  entry  into  production  forests  and \n28. \nmaximize  the  buffer  between  the  alignment  and  Gunung  Condong  protected  forest.  A \ncomprehensive environmental management plan, with budget and responsibilities for mitigating \nmeasures  and  monitoring,  both  during  construction  and  operation,  includes  occupational  and \ncommunity health and safety training, capacity building for PLN staff, and a clear structure for a \n\n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\ngrievance  redress  mechanism.  There  was  adequate  public  consultation  with  stakeholders  on \nenvironmental impacts and measures. \n \n29. \nSocial Safeguards. The project\u2019s safeguard categorization is category B for involuntary \nresettlement and for indigenous people. PLN has paid one landowner for the 4 hectares of land \nneeded for the Tayan substation in September 2012; and 5 landowners for the 6.6 hectares of \nland needed for the Magmagan substation in December 2012. Similarly, PLN has acquired and \ncompensated for the land required for 89 of the 201 towers of the 275 kV transmission line and \nplans to complete the process for all remaining 112 towers  by the end of December 2013. PLN \nexpects no delay or dispute in the process.  \n \nSince the impacts on indigenous peoples (customary communities) are mainly related to \n30. \nthe  project  has  combined  resettlement  and  customary  communities \nland  acquisition, \ndevelopment  plans  (resettlement  plan)  respectively  for  the  275 kV  section  from  Benkayang  to \nthe Malaysian border and for the 150 kV section from Benkayang through Ngabang to Tayan. \nThe  resettlement  plan  for  the  275  kV  line  is  quite  detailed,  as  it  is  based  on  an  inventory  of \nlosses  according  to  a  concept  design.  For  the  150  kV  section,  a  concept  design  was  not \nfinalized  and hence  a  separate resettlement  plan  was prepared.  A  more  detailed  resettlement \nplan  will  be  prepared and disclosed before implementing  the  150 kV  distribution  line.  The two \ndraft resettlement plans based on initial design\u2014were submitted and approved by ADB in 2011 \nand disclosed in July 2011. The resettlement plan for the 275 kV line was updated in April 2013, \nand the resettlement plan for the 150 kV line is now being updated following the final detailed \ndesign. The updated documents will incorporate a due diligence report for acquired land. Both \ndraft  resettlement  plans20  include  gender  strategy  and  strategy  for  customary  communities\u2019 \nidentity and cultural uniqueness. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  With the signing of the PEA, the earlier perceived risks associated with the power import \ncomponent are almost eliminated. The benefits of the project have been widely reported in the \nlocal media of both countries. Although there are significant penalties for both Sarawak Energy \nand  PLN  for  any  delays  under  the  PEA,  the  main  procurement  milestones  have  been \ncompleted,  and  the  remaining  risk  is  the  delay  in  implementation.  The  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.21 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nDelay  in  finalization  of  subsidiary  loan \nagreements  may  affect  implementation \nand disbursement. \nImplementation  delays,  related  to  land \nacquisitions.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nProject  readiness  has  been  ensured  in  compliance  with \ngovernment criteria. \n\nSince February 2013, the West Kalimantan distribution unit \nof  PLN  has  the  full  authority  to  manage  land  acquisition \nland \ndirectly,  which  will  mitigate  delays  caused  by \nacquisition. \n\n                                                \n20  Resettlement  Plans:  Combined  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \nConstruction  delay  on  the  Malaysia  side \nof the transmission line.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  main  procurement  packages  on  both  Malaysia  and \nIndonesia side have been awarded.
