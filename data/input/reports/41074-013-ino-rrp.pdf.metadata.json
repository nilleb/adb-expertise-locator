I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Republic of Indonesia, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) to the Republic of Indonesia, and (iii) proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund1 under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility to  PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN);2 all for \nthe West Kalimantan Power Grid Strengthening Project.3  \n \n2.  The project will strengthen the power grid of West Kalimantan by building new power \ntransmission lines, distribution lines, and associated substations. A 145-kilometer (km) new \ndistribution line, distribution feeder extensions, and a new substation will improve the reliability \nof power supply in West Kalimantan. An 83 km cross-border high-voltage transmission line and \na substation will be part of the overall transmission link on the Indonesian side to connect the \nWest Kalimantan power grid to the power grid of neighboring Sarawak (Malaysia), thus enabling \npower exchange of about 230 megawatts (MW) between the two systems. ADB is preparing \npart of the transmission link on the Malaysian side as a separate nonsovereign loan financed \nproject for the state-owned power utility in Sarawak, Malaysia.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The proposed project will reduce the cost of operating the power system in West \nKalimantan. Oil is one of the most expensive power generation fuels accounting for a quarter of \npower  generation  in  Indonesia  and  all  power  generation  in  West  Kalimantan;  hence,  the \naverage cost of power generation is about $0.25 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).4 Coal, an abundant \nlocal5 undeveloped resource is a substitute fuel for oil, with costs below $0.10/kWh.6 However, \nas developing these coal resources will take time (7\u201310 years), and West Kalimantan urgently \nneeds additional electricity supply to meet growing needs, West Kalimantan considers access to \ncross-border power supply a priority to meet rising demand and at reduced costs. The proposed \ninterconnection with Sarawak at a negotiated import price of $0.10 kWh will enable Indonesia's \nPLN to import 230 MW equivalent of power generation to the West Kalimantan grid by January \n2015. This will enable PLN to enhance its least-cost generation plan by combining hydropower \nimports  from  Sarawak  with  other  Indonesian  base-load  generation  from  oil  or  coal.  The \nproposed power imports may further reduce power generation costs in the future as Sarawak \nplans to develop more hydropower for an average power generation cost below $0.10/kWh.  \n \n4.   The West Kalimantan system demand will grow to about 600 MW by 2020, from \nabout 200 MW in 2012, and in the absence of the proposed interconnection, PLN plans to build \nnew  coal  generation  to  switch  from  the  rented  oil  generators  that  PLN  now  uses.  The \n                                                \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n2  State Electricity Corporation. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB provided technical assistance for the preparation of \nthe project. ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Efficiency Improvement and Connectivity Strengthening in \nArchipelagic Southeast Asia Project. Manila (TA 6441-REG). \n4  About 3 times more than the average cost of generation by other power systems in Southeast Asia.  \n5  Indonesia is a lead coal exporter: About 50% of reserve in Kalimantan (34% in East Kalimantan, 16% in South \nKalimantan, and about 3% in West Kalimantan). \n6  In December 2011, PLN signed an independent power producer contract for 2 x 25 MW at $0.0909/kWh for \n25 years. Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. http://www.esdm.go.id/news-\narchives/electricity/46-electricity/5252-pln-signed-ipp-contract-pltu-pontianak-3.html  ", "2   \ninterconnection has always been an alternative option to meet long term system demand., The \npower utilities in the island of Borneo have been planning a 1,300 km long high-voltage power \ntransmission link, the Trans Borneo Power Grid, to connect the West Kalimantan power grid \nacross Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, to Sabah and enable power exchanges between the \nBIMP-EAGA  countries.7  This  transmission  system  development  will  help  each  area  take \nadvantage of the different power systems and different power generation mixes on the island of \nBorneo: West Kalimantan relies almost entirely on oil, Sarawak largely on hydropower, Brunei \nDarussalam on gas, and Sabah predominantly on diesel and fuel oil.  \n \n5.  Reduced carbon footprint. Currently PLN relies entirely on oil for power generation in \nWest Kalimantan. As PLN will eventually stop using expensive oil-based power generation, the \noverall carbon footprint of Borneo will be reduced. The power interconnection will benefit also \nboth West Kalimantan and Sarawak directly. A base-load supply of 50 MW and about 180 MW \nfor 6 hours a day will amount to about 650,000 megawatt-hours of import of cheaper power from \nSarawak to West Kalimantan each year, at a negotiated import price of $0.10/kWh\u2014annually \nPLN as the buyer will save about $100 million by avoiding oil generation and Sarawak as the \nseller  will earn about $33 million  with its low-cost power generation. This will also create \nopportunities for future power exports and sharing of system reserve margins between the two \ncountries enabling further reduction of carbon footprint. \n \n6.  The proposed interconnection with Sarawak is of strategic importance to PLN. \nWith  the  experience  of  this  interconnection,  PLN  plans  to  expand  its  power  exchange \narrangements  with  its  neighbors,  although  the West  Kalimantan  system  is  relatively  small \ncompared with the Indonesian system: in 2012, demand for power from the West Kalimantan \nsystem was about 200 MW compared with total Indonesian system demand of about 30,000 \nMW; and the proposed 83 km long 275-kilovolt (kV) transmission line is relatively small\u2014PLN \nplans to build about 50,000 km of transmission lines over the next 10 years, including 5,000 km \nof 275 kV lines.  \n \n7.  Signed  power  exchange  agreement.  On  5  September  2012,  PLN  and  Syarikat \nSESCO confirmed their commitment to the project by signing the power exchange agreement \n(PEA) based on the term sheet signed on 18 July 2011. The PEA is for 20 years: the first phase \ncovering the first 5 years has take-or-pay and take-and-pay prices.8 The second-phase duration \ncould be for long term, medium term, or short term within a maximum capacity of 230 MW. The \nPEA covers purchase of about 50 MW of capacity as base load on a take-or-pay basis for \n5 years. In addition, PLN will be able to purchase another 180 MW of capacity as a take-and-\npay  contract.  Both  parties  secured  their  performance  obligations  with  bank  guarantees  of \n$35 million to each other. The parties agreed also to enter into an interconnection agreement \nbefore  30 June  2013.  The  PEA  includes  strict  milestone  schedules\u2014(grid  completion:  31 \nDecember 2014, and supply start: 1 January 2015) in order to avoid paying the $25,000-a-day \npenalty to each other. PLN has awarded contracts for four main packages and have signed \nthese contracts under the approved advanced procurement action.  \n  \n8.  ADB\u2019s continued support for regional cooperation. The project is aligned with ADB's \nenergy  sector  assessment  strategy  and  road  map9  and  the  BIMP-EAGA  implementation \n                                                \n7  BIMP-EAGA refers to the subregional initiative covering Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East \nASEAN Growth Area (http://www.bimp-eaga.org/). \n8  Take-or-pay amounts are like capacity payments: payments for full amounts have to be made even if only a portion \nof the contract amount is consumed. Take-and-pay allows the buyer to pay only for the amounts used.  \n9  Sector Assessment: Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    3 \nblueprint,10 which made improving infrastructure facilities a priority and power interconnection a \nkey strategic pillar. The project is also in line with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Connectivity Plan.11 ADB supports investment in strategic transmission assets that \nconnects regions or countries to optimize power networks by removing transmission bottlenecks \nand transmitting cheaper power from one area to the other, thereby helping achieve overall \nregional socioeconomic and environmental improvement. This project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u2013201412 and country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014,13 \nwhich support the government's economic growth target of 6.3%\u20136.8% per annum in 2010\u2013\n2014 and to reach 7% beyond 2014 despite protracted global recovery. Furthermore, ADB is \nnow working with PLN on the Sumatra\u2013Peninsular Malaysia power interconnection (250 km, \n500 kV, high-voltage direct current line for the sharing of power between Indonesia (Sumatra) \nand Peninsular Malaysia. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be sustainable power supply in West Kalimantan and the outcome will be \nthe reduced cost of operating the power system in West Kalimantan.  \n  \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have three outputs: (i) construction of about 83 km of 275 kV double-\ncircuit  transmission  line  between  Bengkayang  and  the  border  with  Sarawak,  with  a  new \n275/150/20 kV substation in Bengkayang; (ii) construction of about 145 km of 150 kV double-\ncircuit Bengkayang\u2013Ngabang\u2013Tayan distribution line,  with a new 150/250 kV substation in \nNgabang and a four-line distribution feeder extension for the 150 kV Tayan substation and \nBengkayang substation; and (iii) new connections to 8,000 households in West Kalimantan.  \n  \n11.  A large proportion of the population has no access to grid-connected electricity, and at \nany  given  time  a  large  number  of  customers  are  in  the  queue  for  connection  in  West \nKalimantan. Because of power supply shortages and lack of funds for investing in low-voltage \ndistribution,  PLN  is  unable  to  meet  the  demand  for  new  connections.  The  proposed  new \nhousehold connections (output 3) will reduce the connection charges and connection time \nthrough a single initiative for the communities living between Bengkayang and Sarawak border. \nThe connection charge varies from $35 to about $100 depending on the size of the connection \n(450\u20131,300 volt-amperes). About 8,000 households will also benefit from training on energy \nefficiency,  provision  of  energy-efficient  lighting,  and  improved  local  community  centers \n(hospitals and schools). With access to electricity, these households will have access to other \neconomic opportunities, improve their livelihood, and stop using kerosene or oil lamps for \nlighting. This will contribute to ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative to increase access to modern forms \nof energy.14 PLN will use its $2 million, a part of its counterpart funds, together with the $2 \nmillion grant to support the necessary upgrade of low-voltage systems. ADB will work with PLN \nto determine the beneficiaries of output 3.15 The details will be finalized during inception of the \nproject.  \n \n                                                \n10  BIMP-EAGA. 2012.

Procurement \n18.  ADB has approved advance contracting and retroactive financing for goods and related \nservices. This will cover tendering and bid evaluation up to the stage of ADB\u2019s approval of \nPLN\u2019s recommendation for award of contract before the effective date of the loan and project \nagreements. The government and PLN have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to approve the proposed loan and that ADB financing will  \ndepend on the government's compliance with all aspects of ADB's procedural requirements, \nincluding compliance with the relevant provisions of the loan and project agreements and ADB's \nguidelines.  PLN\u2019s  procurement  for  the  275  kV  transmission  line  and  substation  are  quite \nadvanced under the advance contracting approved by ADB in August 2011. Four international \ncompetitive bidding packages have been bid out in August 2012 and PLN has signed contracts \nfor three of the four packages as of 11 June 2013 with a total value of about $68 million.  \n \n19.  ADB will finance expenditures for the procurement of goods, works, and consulting \nservices paid for by PLN prior to the effective date of the loan agreement, provided such \nexpenditures were incurred with the concurrence of ADB. Retroactive finance will cover the \nmaximum amount of eligible expenditures up to the equivalent of 20% of the total ADB loan, \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. The AFD loan will have the same retroactive financing provisions.  \n \n20.  The project will procure four contract packages under international competitive bidding \nunder the loan component. The grant component (access to power) will have one distribution \nline contract package under PLN financing, one international competitive bidding package for \ncivil  works  with  associated  goods,  and  consulting  services.  Details  are  provided  in  the \nprocurement plan (footnote 16). \n \n2.   Implementation Consultants \n21.  An international consulting firm will be engaged to manage the implementation of the \nproject, especially the 275 kV cross-border transmission component. The firm will deliver a total \nof  206  person-months  of  consulting  services  (28  person-months  of  international  and \n178 person-months  of  national  consulting  inputs)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method with a 80:20 ratio and using a full technical proposal. The grant \ncomponent  will  require  24  person-months  of  consulting  services  (10  person-months  of \ninternational and 14 person-months of national consultants) to be engaged intermittently. The \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in the project administration manual (footnote 16).  \n \n ", "    7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n22.  ADB staff has reviewed the project preparatory studies and confirmed the technical \nproject  design.  The  double-circuit  Mambong\u2013Bengkayang  275  kV  transmission  line \ninterconnection takes into account maintenance of the largest generating unit in  the West \nKalimantan system and the need to import additional power from Sarawak to West Kalimantan \nto ensure the N-1 reliability contingency17 during operation. As most of the existing power plants \nin the West Kalimantan system will be retired by 2017, the power import to West Kalimantan as \nproposed is feasible under normal (N) and single contingency (N-1) conditions. Currently, PLN \ndoes not have an appropriate control center in Pontianak. Until the control center in Pontianak is \nready, the 275 kV transmission line will be operated and controlled from Kuching. The technical \nteams of PLN and Sarawak Energy will have to agree on a standard operating practice.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Financial  and  economic  benefits  were  calculated  on  the  basis  of  imported  power, \nreplacing expensive oil-fired power generation. The cost estimates are in constant 2012 prices. \nPLN\u2019s recent project costs and consultants confirmation are the basis of these cost estimates.  \n \n24.  The FIRR is 30%, based on a cash flow for 20 years, which is higher than the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.1%, making the project financially viable. This project has a high \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) because the financial benefits include, in addition to the \nbenefit  of  wheeling  electricity,  the  direct  benefit  of  importing  power  at  a  lower  price  from \nSarawak  enabling  PLN  and  avoid  expensive  power  generated  by  burning  oil  in  West \nKalimantan.  The benefit calculation is based on a range of power purchase and off-take \nscenarios: the base-case scenario assumes that only 50 MW will be take-and-pay for off-peak \ntime for the first 5 years, and only 50 MW will be purchased as base load after the first 5 years \nof contract at a 25% higher tariff. The high-case scenario assumes that 100 MW will be take-\nand-pay for the first 5 years and same capacity will be purchased by PLN at a price 15% higher \nfor the next 5 years, while the low-case scenario assumes that no take-and-pay and no power \npurchase will occur after the first 5 years. For the base case, the FIRR is 30% and the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 52%. The FIRR varies from 17.7% to 42.0% for the different \nscenarios. The EIRR ranges from 32% to 70%, and the net present value is $243 million (base \ncase) over the life of the project.18  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PLN. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.  To  ensure  transparency  and  good \ngovernance, PLN will publicly disclose on its website information on how loan proceeds are \nbeing used. For each procurement contract, PLN will disclose (i) the list of participating bidders, \n(ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the \namount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods and services purchased, and (vi) the \nintended and actual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract being awarded. ADB will \n                                                \n17 The  system is planned such that, with all  transmission  facilities in service, the system  is  in  a secure state, and     \n      for any one credible contingency event, the system moves to a satisfactory stage. Beyond that the load may have    \n    to be shed.

Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Being  a  general-intervention  project  with  sustainability  and  regional  cooperation  as \nexpected  impact,  the  poverty  reduction  channels  are  more  indirect.  However,  the  grant \ncomponent will extend project benefits to the households in the project area. In addition to \nconnecting  new  households,  it  will  improve  supply  reliability  (i.e.,  fewer  blackouts).  Local \ncommunities  will  also  be  able  to  work  in  project  construction  and  maintenance  activities. \nIndustrial growth, especially in rubber factories, and increased trading activities with reliable \npower supply will create jobs, especially for low-income groups. The basic public services\u2014\neducation, health, and water supply\u2014will improve because of access to electricity. The project \nwill benefit the minority households in the neighborhoods of the Benkawang substation to the \nborder of Sarawak. There are no gender measures in the project. The project will not have any \nadverse impact on women and/or girls, or widen gender inequality. Due diligence did not \nhighlight specific gender issues, as transmission projects are, by their nature, unlikely to provide \nopportunity for gender design; however, there will be direct and substantial benefits to women \nfrom better electricity supply. The benefits from electricity will accrue largely in the form of labor \nsavings,  greater  social  interaction,  and  broader  options  for  work  and  other  activities.  The \nresettlement plans for the project include specific actions to ensure that women are included \neffectively  in  the  land  acquisition  process  (e.g.,  poor  women  and  households  headed  by \nwomen). A social impact assessment19 has been prepared to examine key aspects such as \npoverty, vulnerability, education, health, ethnicity, and gender.  \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n27.  Environment. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project \nhas  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  requiring  the  preparation  of  an  initial \nenvironmental examination, which has been approved by PLN and ADB and disclosed on the \nADB website on August 2011. The proposed transmission line will pass along existing roads \nand the transmission corridor is limited to areas affected by human presence with agriculture as \nthe principal land use. Use of good international construction practices during implementation \nwill  mitigate  some  of  the  temporary  impacts,  including,  vegetation  clearing,  soil  erosion, \ndrainage,  effects  on  water  and  air  quality,  waste  management,  additional  demand  on \ninfrastructure, hunting and fuel wood collection by workers, and occupational and community \nhealth and safety issues. Neither the 275 kV transmission line nor the 150 kV distribution line \nenters  any  protected  and  primary  forests,  wetlands,  or  areas  identified  as  having  special \necological significance or cultural heritage sites. The closest the 275 kV transmission line comes \nto a protected forest is about 2 km; north of Tayan, the 150 kV distribution line passes at a \ndistance of 500\u2013800 meters to the Gunung Condong protected forest, which will be designated \nas \u201cno go\u201d area to be strictly off-limit for all workers.  \n \n28.  The final alignment will be fine-tuned to minimize entry into production forests and \nmaximize  the  buffer  between  the  alignment  and  Gunung  Condong  protected  forest.  A \ncomprehensive environmental management plan, with budget and responsibilities for mitigating \nmeasures and monitoring, both during construction and operation, includes occupational and \ncommunity health and safety training, capacity building for PLN staff, and a clear structure for a \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "    9 \ngrievance redress mechanism. There was adequate public consultation with stakeholders on \nenvironmental impacts and measures. \n \n29.  Social Safeguards. The project\u2019s safeguard categorization is category B for involuntary \nresettlement and for indigenous people. PLN has paid one landowner for the 4 hectares of land \nneeded for the Tayan substation in September 2012; and 5 landowners for the 6.6 hectares of \nland needed for the Magmagan substation in December 2012. Similarly, PLN has acquired and \ncompensated for the land required for 89 of the 201 towers of the 275 kV transmission line and \nplans to complete the process for all remaining 112 towers  by the end of December 2013. PLN \nexpects no delay or dispute in the process.  \n \n30.  Since the impacts on indigenous peoples (customary communities) are mainly related to \nland  acquisition,  the  project  has  combined  resettlement  and  customary  communities \ndevelopment plans (resettlement plan) respectively for the 275 kV section from Benkayang to \nthe Malaysian border and for the 150 kV section from Benkayang through Ngabang to Tayan. \nThe resettlement plan for the 275 kV line is quite detailed, as it is based on an inventory of \nlosses according to a concept design. For the 150 kV section, a concept design was not \nfinalized and hence a separate resettlement plan was prepared. A more detailed resettlement \nplan will be prepared and disclosed before implementing the 150 kV distribution line. The two \ndraft resettlement plans based on initial design\u2014were submitted and approved by ADB in 2011 \nand disclosed in July 2011. The resettlement plan for the 275 kV line was updated in April 2013, \nand the resettlement plan for the 150 kV line is now being updated following the final detailed \ndesign. The updated documents will incorporate a due diligence report for acquired land. Both \ndraft resettlement plans20 include gender strategy and strategy for customary communities\u2019 \nidentity and cultural uniqueness. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  With the signing of the PEA, the earlier perceived risks associated with the power import \ncomponent are almost eliminated. The benefits of the project have been widely reported in the \nlocal media of both countries. Although there are significant penalties for both Sarawak Energy \nand  PLN  for  any  delays  under  the  PEA,  the  main  procurement  milestones  have  been \ncompleted, and the remaining risk is the delay in implementation. The risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay  in  finalization  of  subsidiary  loan  Project  readiness  has  been  ensured  in  compliance  with \nagreements  may  affect  implementation  government criteria. \nand disbursement. \nImplementation  delays,  related  to  land  Since February 2013, the West Kalimantan distribution unit \nacquisitions.   of PLN has the full authority to manage land acquisition \ndirectly,  which  will  mitigate  delays  caused  by  land \nacquisition. \n                                                \n20 Resettlement Plans: Combined Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n       ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nConstruction delay on the Malaysia side  The  main  procurement  packages  on  both  Malaysia  and \nof the transmission line.
