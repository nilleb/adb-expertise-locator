Past \nneglect of the road network has meant that much of the rural \npopulation live in areas that are cut off from the economic and \nsocial  mainstream.  About  three  quarters  of  people  in \nChhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh live in rural areas, and the \nmajority of rural habitations do not have an all-weather road \nconnection. The poverty head count rates in these states are \namong the highest in India.  \n   \nObjective   The  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  deprivation,  and \nsupport economic growth by providing enhanced access to \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services, \nincluding health and education. The objective will be achieved \nby (i) providing rural habitations in Chhattisgarh and Madhya \nPradesh with all-weather road connections; and (ii) improving \nthe efficiency and sustainability of rural roads by providing \nsupport  for  capacity  building,  research  and  development; \ndeveloping  financing  and  implementation  arrangements  for \nmaintaining rural roads throughout their economic life; and \nimproving safety on rural roads. \n \nUsing the sector lending modality of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), the Project will finance the construction of about \n11,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads  \u2014 about 5,500 km in \nChhattisgarh and 5,500 km in Madhya Pradesh. A sample of \nabout 1,000 km of subprojects has been prepared in detail. \nThe  Government  will  prepare  additional  subprojects  during \nproject  implementation  in  accordance  with  agreed  upon \nselection and approval procedures. \n \n \n \n   ", "iv   \nSupport  for  road  asset  management  will  establish \ndecentralized systems and capacity for maintaining the rural \nroads network in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, secure \nthe necessary financing for maintenance, and assist the state \ngovernments to enter into contractual commitments to road \nmaintenance initially covering at least the first 10 years of \noperations.  Road  safety  audit  will  be  introduced  and \ncommunity-based approaches to road safety will be developed \nto accompany project investments in road connectivity. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $571 million \nequivalent comprising foreign exchange of $269.1 million, and \nlocal currency of $301.9 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  % \nExchange  Currency   Cost \n  ADB  229.4  170.6  400.0  70 \n  Government  39.7  131.3  171.0  30 \n    Total  269.1  301.9  571.0  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based lending facility. \n  The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 \n  years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%,  a \n  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other \n  terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project \n  Agreements.  \n   \nAllocation and  The  Government  will  provide  the  Loan  proceeds  in  local \nRelending Terms  currency to MORD and the state governments of CG and MP \n  on  a  grant  basis.

The consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures and according to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By  improving  rural  roads  connectivity  and  ensuring  that \nBeneficiaries  improvements will be sustainable, the Project will address one \nof the main underlying causes of poverty and deprivation in \nChhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The Project is expected to \nhave  significant  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  and \nsocioeconomic  development  by  facilitating  (i)  growth  in \nagricultural incomes; (ii) growth in other sources of income and \nemployment  in  the  immediate  influence  areas  of  the  road \nconnectivity improvements; (iii) access to employment through \nlabor mobility; (iv) reduced  prices to consumers and users of \nservices; (v) improved health and longevity through access to \nbetter health services; (vi) improved educational attainment \ndue  to  access  to  schools,  teachers,  and  educational \nsupervisors; (vii) improvements in production through access \nto extension services; and (viii) greater opportunity for rural \npeople  to  participate  in  the  wider  society.  The  quantified \neconomic benefits consist of (i) vehicle operating cost savings, \n(ii)  passenger  time  savings,  and  (iii)  reduced  spoilage  of \nagricultural produce.  The economic internal rate of return of \nthe  sample  subprojects  is  26.6%.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject will include the bulk of the rural population of the two \nstates:  (i)  direct  users  of  road  transport,  including \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers  of  the \nvarious  vehicle  categories,  labor,  and  the  Government;  (ii) \nthose benefiting indirectly because they live in the area of \ninfluence  of  the  roads;  and  (iii)  those benefiting indirectly \nthrough the wider impacts of higher economic growth in their \ndistricts and in the states as a whole. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, technical assistance (TA) is \nproposed to assist in preparing the Rural Roads  Sector  II \nProject. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.25 million \nequivalent.  The  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  will \nfinance $1 million equivalent, on a grant basis, covering all the \nforeign  exchange  costs  ($327,800)  and  part  of  the  local \ncurrency costs. A consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures, and individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  The \nExecuting Agency for the TA will be MORD. \n   ", " ", " ", "                       \n         \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia  for  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  I  Project.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  The Road Sector \n2.  India\u2019s highway network consists of about 58,112 kilometers (km) of national highways, \nabout 64,200 km of state highways and major district roads (MDRs), and about 2.7 million km of \nrural roads. National highways provide the high-density links between states. They comprise only \n1.7% of the network but carry about 40% of traffic. State highways link national highways with \ndistrict headquarters, important towns, and minor ports; and MDRs run within districts, connecting \nareas of production with markets, and rural areas to district headquarters and to state highways \nand national highways. MDRs comprise about 19% of the network and carry about 40% of traffic. \nRural  roads  link  rural  communities  with  the  highway  network,  providing  access  to  higher \nagricultural incomes, employment opportunities, and social services.  Rural roads are considered \na key element of rural development and poverty reduction. They represent about 80% of the \nnetwork and carry about 20% of traffic. Analysis of the roads subsector is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The sustained underinvestment in road infrastructure in India has affected all levels of the \nroad network.1 At the same time, traffic on all modes has been growing at around 10% per year in \nthe past decade. In the road sector, freight traffic increased at about 12% per year and passenger \ntraffic at about 8%. The rapid growth in traffic has led to congestion, road deterioration and high \ncosts  of  transport.  As  a  result  there  is  considerable  suppressed  demand.  The  potential \ncontribution of efficient road transport to the economy will only be realized if the level of services \nand the capacity of the road infrastructure increase to meet the demand.  \n \n4.  A task force on infrastructure, set up by the Prime Minister in 1998, identified the need to \ntriple or quadruple the ongoing rate of investment in transport infrastructure, which had again \nfallen well below 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). As a first step, the task force backed a \n13,000 km National Highway Development Project for establishing an integrated national highway \nnetwork. This involved upgrading to 4 or 6 lanes in heavily trafficked sections the links between \nthe major metropolitan towns and two central transverse routes, one north-south and the other \neast-west. Executing the project was entrusted to the National Highways Authority of India for \ncompletion by 2010. Despite severe fiscal constraints, budgets for other transport infrastructure \nhave also been raised substantially in the last few years, and many states have initiated major \nnew efforts to upgrade trunk road infrastructure and increase the pace of rural road expansion.  \n \n5.  Throughout the road sector, service quality and capacity have been further compromised \ndue to lack of adequate  maintenance of existing road assets. Maintenance has suffered from \ninadequate financing, lack of planning, and weaknesses in execution. As a result, deterioration of \nroad infrastructure has led eventually to the need for reconstruction at a higher cost which places \nfurther strain on the available funds. \n                                                 \n1  Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 1980-1985, annual investment in roads varied between 0.6% and 1.5% of gross \ndomestic product, with an average of 1.1%. ", "2   \n2.  National Rural Roads Program \n6.  About 70% of India\u2019s population live in rural areas, and about 40% of rural habitations2 are \nnot connected to all-weather roads (330,000 out of 825,000 habitations). Many villages still rely \non earth tracks that are unsuitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during rainy \nseason. Even where all-weather connections have been provided in the past, the standard of \nrural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many roads are in need of rehabilitation.  \n \n7.  While the determinants of poverty vary between states, there is a strong link between lack \nof road connectivity and poverty in India. For example, the three states with the highest proportion \nof poor people in their populations (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa) are also among the most \ndisadvantaged in terms of road connectivity.3 There is also a strong link between improvement in \nroad connectivity and poverty reduction. Recent studies have indicated that public expenditure on \nrural roads in India has had a greater poverty reduction impact than expenditure on agricultural \nresearch,  irrigation,  power,  education,  health,  soil  and  water  conservation,  and  existing \nantipoverty programs. For every Rs1 million (about $21,000 equivalent) spent on rural roads, 124 \npeople were lifted out of poverty.4  \n \n8.  To address the problem of lack of rural road connectivity, in 2000 the Government \nestablished a national rural roads program known as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime \nMinister\u2019s Rural Roads Program [PMGSY]). Its objective  is to provide good all-weather road \nconnections5 to all habitations with a population of 1,000 or more by the year 2003 and to all \nhabitations with a population of 500 or more by 2007. In hilly or desert areas, or scheduled tribe \n(ST) areas as defined in Schedule V of the Constitution of India, the objective is to connect all \nhabitations with a population of at least 250 by 2007. On this basis, PMGSY has identified more \nthan 160,000 unconnected habitations requiring new road connectivity investments. Details of the \neligible habitations are in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  PMGSY is funded by the central Government, with the Ministry of Rural Development \n(MORD)  acting  as  overall  coordinating  ministry.  State  governments have responsibility for \nplanning and implementing at the state level as well as for funding, planning, and executing \nmaintenance. The estimated total cost of PMGSY from 2002 to 2007 is about Rs550 billion (about \n$11 billion equivalent). About 32% is to be funded from a 50% share of the cess on high-speed \ndiesel.6 The balance of 68% of funding remains to be identified. The Government has requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other external agencies to finance part of the program.  \n                                                 \n2  A habitation is a cluster of houses in a compact and contiguous area. A single village may have more than one \nhabitation, each habitation being separated from any other. \n3  According to Planning Commission estimates, in 1999-2000 the proportion of poor people in total state population \nwas 42.6% in Bihar, 37.4% in Madhya Pradesh (MP), and 47.2% in Orissa, compared with a national average of \n26%. Based on statistics in National Human Development Report 2001, the level of road connectivity for habitations \nwith less than 1,000 persons in 1996-1997 was 40.7% in Bihar, 22.3% in MP, and 44% in Orissa, compared with a \nnational average of 49.2%. \n4  Fan, S., P. Hazell and S. Thorat. 2000. Government Spending, Growth and Poverty in Rural India, American Journal \nof Agricultural Economics 82 (4). \n5  PMGSY defines an all-weather road as one that is negotiable in all weathers, and has adequate cross-drainage \nstructures to effectively drain the roadbed.  \n6  The Central Road Fund Act, 2000 introduced an additional excise duty (cess) of Rs1.00 per liter on petrol and \nRs1.00 on high-speed diesel, to be allocated as follows: (i) 50% of cess on high-speed diesel to the development of \nrural roads; and (ii) 50% of cess on high-speed diesel and 100% of cess on petrol to be assigned to maintenance of \nnational highways, road bridges under/over railway lines and safety work at unmanned railway crossings, and \ndevelopment and maintenance of state roads. \n   ", "  3 \n10.  At the national level, PMGSY is administered by MORD through the National Rural Roads \nDevelopment  Agency  (NRRDA).  At  the  state  level,  the  government  nominates  a  nodal \ndepartment to execute the program. This is typically the rural development department or the \npublic works department. This department is required to appoint project implementation units \n(PIUs) at the district level to be responsible for program implementation and to identify or \nestablish a state-level autonomous agency with a distinct legal status to receive funds from \nMORD. All PMGSY road investments are executed by private contractors engaged through \ncompetitive tendering.  \n \n11.  In consultation with the states, MORD has established PMGSY guidelines for the states in \nimplementing PMGSY.7 They provide the following guiding principles and definitions for PMGSY:  \n(i) improvements are limited to roads categorized as other district roads and village roads forming \npart of the core rural roads network of through routes and link routes;8 (ii) new all-weather \nconnectivity  has  precedence  over  improvement  of  existing  fair-weather  connectivity,  and \nupgrading fair-weather through routes has precedence over upgrading fair-weather link routes; \nand (iii) among eligible roads of similar type, precedence si given to those serving a larger \npopulation. The guidelines also establish (i) the technical specifications and geometric design \nstandards for PMGSY roads to ensure that all roads built will be of sound design with adequate \ndrainage, in accordance with Indian Road Congress standards; and (ii) a three-tier quality control \nsystem consisting of the PIU or executive engineer, independent quality monitoring at the state \nlevel, and independent quality monitoring at the national level.   \n \n12.  The PMGSY guidelines also establish the approach to planning PMGSY at state, district, \nand block levels, including use of the Manual for Preparation of District Roads Plan. The manual \nexplains the procedures for drawing up each district\u2019s plan for connecting all eligible habitations, \nwith choice of routing for each eligible habitation to be determined by weighting socioeconomic \nand infrastructure variables so as to select the route that will maximize the socioeconomic \nbenefits  of  the  new  connection.  The  preparation  of  plans  requires  extensive  community \nconsultation. Plans are first prepared at block level for approval by the intermediate panchayat.9 \nBlock plans are consolidated into district plans for approval by the zilla panchayat. \n \n13.  In each of the  fiscal years 2000/01 and 2001/02, MORD earmarked Rs25 billion ($0.5 \nbillion equivalent) for PMGSY. As of June 2002, Rs50 billion ($1 billion equivalent) had been \ndisbursed to participating states and road works were at various stages of implementation. By \nFebruary 2003, 88% of the 13,070 road works in the 2000/01 allocation and 10% of the 10,932 \nroad works in the 2001/02 allocation had been completed.  \n \n14.  The PMGSY guidelines require states seeking PMGSY financing to identify suitable zilla \nor intermediate panchayat institutions for undertaking maintenance of the rural roads developed \nunder PMGSY, and to hand over PMGSY roads to such institutions.10 The state government is \nalso required to provide an undertaking to remit to these institutions the costs of the requisite \nmaintenance through either budget allocations or alternative sources of funding. The guidelines \n                                                 \n7  PMGSY Guidelines No. P-12025/8/2001-RC(Pt), Government of India, MORD, revised 15 January 2003. \n8  The core network is that minimal network of roads needed to provide all eligible habitations access to basic social \nand economic services through at least a single all-weather road. Through routes are those that collect traffic from \nseveral link roads or a long chain of habitations and lead it to marketing centers either directly or through higher \ncategory roads. Link routes are roads connecting a single habitation or group of habitations to through routes or \ndistrict roads leading to market centers.  \n9  A panchayat is a body of directly elected people responsible for development of activities in an area. There are three \nlevels of panchayat, comprising gram panchayat at village level, intermediate panchayat at block level, and zilla \npanchayat at district level. \n10 Following  the  73rd  Constitutional  Amendment  in  1992,  state  governments  are  to  assign  responsibility  for   \nmaintenance of rural roads to panchayats and to remit necessary financial resources for this purpose. \n   ", "4   \nindicate that establishing and implementing satisfactory mechanisms to provide funding and other \nassistance for maintaining PMGSY assets will be a key requirement for states to be considered \nfor future assistance under the PMGSY. \n \n3.  Rural Roads Improvement in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh \n15.  The states of Chhattisgarh (CG) and Madhya Pradesh (MP), which are the focus of the \nproposed Project, are among the most needy in rural road connectivity. Recent estimates show \nthat less than half of all habitations with more than 500 persons have an all-weather road \nconnection.  The  total  number  of  unconnected  habitations  identified  for  new  connectivity \ninvestments under PMGSY is 15,608 in CG and 9,502 in MP (Appendix 2), together equivalent to \n15% of the national total. It is estimated that to provide these habitations with new connectivity, \nmore than 80,000 km of all-weather rural roads will have to be built in each state.  \n \n16.  The state governments of CG and MP attach high priority to PMGSY. This has been \nreflected in their favorable performance during the first 2 years of PMGSY compared with other \nstates. In the first annual PMGSY program in 2000/01, 113 road works valued at Rs920 million \n($20 million equivalent) were undertaken in CG and 413 works valued at Rs2.2 billion ($47 million \nequivalent) in MP. Based on good implementation performance under the first annual program,11 \nPMGSY activities in the two states were expanded in the second annual program in 2001/02 to \ncover 270 works for Rs1.85 billion ($40 million equivalent) in CG and 890 works for Rs5.1 billion \n($110  million  equivalent)  in  MP. Both states are making good progress in implementing the \n2001/02 annual program, and are planning a similar volume of additional works in 2002/03. Both \nstates have received good and improving ratings from national independent quality monitors up to \nDecember 2002. Of 297 works inspected in CG, 76% were rated good or very good, and only 4% \nwere rated poor. Of 664 works inspected in MP, 88% were rated good or very good, and only 1% \nwas rated poor. MP\u2019s overall quality rating was among the best for all states. Over the course of \nsuccessive inspections, the ratings of both states have shown an improving trend.  \n \n17.  Small-size  private  transport  operators  account  for  nearly  all  passenger  and  freight \nservices  on  rural  roads.  Due  to  competition  among  such  operators,  it  is  expected  that  a \nsubstantial proportion of the vehicle operating cost savings due to rural roads improvements will \nbe passed on from operators to users.  \n \n18.  Road crashes in India conservatively account for 70,000 fatalities and approximately \n400,000 serious injuries each year. The result is a financial burden estimated to be in excess of \n2% of GDP, equal to $9 billion yearly. The rate of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles in India \nhas reached 16.3, one of the highest levels in the world. In CG and MP, where the level of vehicle \nownership  is  relatively  low  compared  with  the  population,  the  rates  are  13.6  and  12.4 \nrespectively. The PMGSY rural road connectivity program is expected to contribute to increased \nvehicle ownership and travel by villagers and to increased exposure and risk of road user injury. \nRoad safety measures to mitigate these risks will have to be developed alongside PMGSY since \nthere are no well-established road safety programs in CG and MP.  \n \n                                                 \n11 By the end of 2002, the 2000/01 annual program showed completion of 53% of works and 81% of contract \nexpenditure in Chhattisgarh, and 39% of works and 65% of expenditure in Madhya Pradesh. \n   ", "  5 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n19.  While considerable progress has been made in the first 2 years of PMGSY, several \nimportant challenges need to be addressed to realize the full potential of improved rural roads \nconnectivity in as efficient and sustainable a manner as possible. The main challenges are to (i) \nensure the sustainability of investments by establishing a sound approach to maintenance of the \nPMGSY rural roads network, including securing the required levels of maintenance financing, \nbuilding  capacity,  and  systems  at  state  and  zilla  panchayat  level;  and  establishing  sound \napproaches  to  executing  maintenance;  (ii)  refine  the  subproject  selection  criteria  to  ensure \nnetwork efficiency by developing the necessary through routes for link roads to connect with the \nstate and national road network, and to take into account economic viability, remoteness, and \nextent of poverty; (iii) establish efficient implementation arrangements that avoid creating an \noverhang of unwanted public sector staff when PMGSY has been completed; and (iv) identify and \nintroduce road safety measures to accompany PMGSY road investments so as to mitigate the \nrisks of increased vehicle speeds leading to increased road accidents.  \n \n2.  External Assistance \n20.  The road sector in India has received substantial external assistance in the past. Although \nADB has not previously supported rural roads in India, it has provided loans amounting to about \n$1.8 billion for highways from 1988 to 2002, including seven projects for national highways and \none for state roads.12 The World Bank has provided 16 loans amounting to about $3.5 billion for \nupgrading national highways, improving state highways, constructing and rehabilitating rural \nroads, and one urban transport project. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has \nprovided five loans amounting to $0.3 billion to upgrade national highways and construct a bridge. \nThe Government of the United Kingdom has financed technical assistance supporting several \nADB road projects, including engineering support and institutional strengthening as part of ADB\u2019s \nproject for improving state roads in MP,13 and preparatory technical assistance for the proposed \nProject (para. 25). A summary of external assistance to the road sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s support for the road sector has been developed in close collaboration with the \nDepartment for International Development (UK) (DFID), JBIC, and World Bank. ADB and the \nWorld Bank have adopted a Coordinated Assistance Strategy for the Road Sector, which was \nprepared  jointly  in  March  2001  and  updated  in  January  2002.  They  hold  regular  tripartite \nmeetings with the Government to discuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has also met \nregularly with the World Bank team preparing a proposed project to support PMGSY in the states \nof Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajastan, and Uttar Pradesh, and the two banks have shared \ntheir respective project preparatory studies. DFID has been considering providing future support \nto PMGSY, and ADB has met regularly with DFID for coordination and information sharing. JBIC \nand ADB are exploring possible cofinancing of road projects in India. \n \n3.  Lessons \n22.  Implementing ADB\u2019s first three national highways projects was delayed by operational and \ninstitutional shortcomings. The problems were addressed in the subsequent national highways \nprojects, by (i) allowing advance procurement of civil works and recruitment of supervision \n                                                 \n12  ADB support for the road sector in India has included nine loans totaling $1,823 million and 37 TAs totaling $14.815 \nmillion.  \n13 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n   ", "6   \nconsultants; (ii) establishing and operationalizing PIUs before loan effectiveness; (iii) removing \nutilities and other encumbrances before construction starts; (iv) increasing the size of contract \npackages to attract experienced international contractors; and (v) raising the level of authority of \nthe independent engineer under the contract to ensure efficient and quick decision making during \nexecution. Taking into account improvements in performance, and recognizing the important \ncontribution of highways to poverty reduction  and growth, and the contributions that ADB has \nmade to institutional and policy reform in the road sector, the Country Strategy and Program \n(CSP) for 2003-2006 includes 11 more loans for the road sector. For the first time, the CSP \nincludes two projects for rural roads. The CSP envisages a programmatic approach to ADB \nsupport for highways, whereby accomplishment of institutional and policy reforms agreed upon in \none project will trigger processing and approval of the next related project. \n \n23.  A recent ADB study examined the impact of rural roads on poverty reduction, from six \ncase studies of completed rural roads in Indonesia, Philippines, and Sri Lanka.14 The study \nconfirmed that, in all cases, the poor benefited substantially from improved access to services \nand information, and from improved access to livelihood opportunities. The extent to which the \npoor benefited from cheaper transport services depended on the level of competition among \ntransport operators. The sustainability of impacts depended on adequate maintenance of the \nroads. Overall, the study confirmed that roads are a critical enabling factor for improving living \nconditions in rural areas, but found that the extent to which the poor benefit also depends on \nfactors outside of the road subsector, such as the distribution of assets and the skills base of the \npoor.  The  study  recommended  that  future  rural  roads  projects  should  incorporate  baseline \nsurveys  and  benefit  monitoring  to  improve  understanding  of  the  poverty  reduction  and \nsocioeconomic impacts.   \n \n4.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n24.  The  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  CSP  is  mainstreaming  poverty  reduction.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities for the Tenth Five-Year Plan 2002-2007, this is to be addressed primarily \nby supporting economic growth, including both high growth and equitable, pro-poor growth. \nGrowth has been identified as the major channel through which poverty can be reduced in India. \nThe  CSP  points  to  emerging  consensus  over  the  importance  of  infrastructure  in  poverty \nreduction,  through  both  its  indirect  impact  on  growth  leading  to  increased  incomes  and \nemployment,  and  its  direct  contributions  to  incomes  and  employment  and  reducing  human \npoverty by improving access to social services. The CSP also identifies the need for infrastructure \nprojects to incorporate institutional reforms to improve sustainability, particularly by establishing \nsound approaches to maintenance. The proposed Project combines each of the main thrusts of \nthe CSP. By connecting rural habitations to the state and national road networks, the final link \nbetween rural producers and their distant urban markets will be completed, leading to both high \ngrowth and growth that poor rural people will participate in and benefit from disproportionately. \nRural  roads  improvements  will  also  provide  poor  rural  people  with  better  access  to  social \nservices. The Project incorporates improved approaches to maintenance of rural roads to ensure \nthe investments are sustainable. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n25.  In  2002  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  series  of  loans  to  assist  in \nimplementing PMGSY, beginning with the proposed Project in CG and MP. At that time ADB \nidentified the need to provide reliable implementation arrangements for the proposed large \ninvestments  in  rural  roads,  and  to  incorporate  provision  for  maintenance  to  ensure  the \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2002. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction: A Case Study-Based Analysis. Manila. \n   ", "  7 \ninvestments  will  be  sustainable.  To  facilitate  project  preparation,  ADB  provided  small-scale \ntechnical assistance (TA) financed by the Government of the United Kingdom for preparing a \nsample of about 1,000 km of roads.  The TA covered (i) economic studies, (ii) engineering, (iii) \ninstitutional and policies studies, (iv) environmental analysis, and (v) social analysis.15  \n \n26.  During project formulation, agreement was reached with MORD, the state government of \nChhattisgarh  and  the  state  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  to  (i)  improve  the  criteria  for \nsubproject selection to incorporate network planning considerations, economic return thresholds, \nand safeguard provisions; (ii) address the issue of prioritization between through routes and link \nroutes in the PMGSY guidelines; (iii) establish a dedicated rural roads development agency to \nimplement the proposed Project in CG; (iv) commit required levels of financing for maintenance, \n(v) establish reliable approaches to planning and executing maintenance, and enter into long-\nterm maintenance contracts for all PMGSY roads; and (vi) incorporate road safety measures to \naccompany PMGSY road connectivity improvements. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n27.  The Project aims to reduce poverty and deprivation, and support economic growth by \nproviding enhanced access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services, including \nhealth and education. The objective will be attained by (i) providing rural habitations in CG and \nMP with all-weather road connections; (ii) improving the efficiency and sustainability of PMGSY \nby providing support for capacity building, research and development; developing financing and \nimplementation arrangements for maintaining PMGSY roads throughout their economic life; and \nimproving safety on rural roads in CG and MP.  The Project framework is in Appendix 5. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n28.  The Project will finance the construction of about 11,000 km of rural roads: about 5,500 \nkm in CG and 5,500 km in MP. Consulting services will be provided to support preparation and \nimplementation of road construction subprojects, to establish sustainable asset management \nsystems for the PMGSY rural roads networks in CG and MP, and build capacity and provide \ntraining. Consulting services will support the development of road safety audit under PMGSY and \ncommunity-based approaches to road safety to accompany project road connectivity investments. \n \n1.  Road Connectivity Component \n29.  The Project will finance improvements of rural roads that are part of the Government\u2019s \nnational rural roads program under PMGSY to provide all habitations of at least 500 persons with \nall-weather roads by 2007. It will support improvements in CG and MP, in accordance with the \nPMGSY  core  networks  of  these  states.  Details  of  the  sector  investment  plan  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n30.  The  road  connectivity  component  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  modality.  This  is \nconsidered justified since (i) under PMGSY the Union and state governments have prepared well-\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2002.

In accordance with ADB\u2019s sector lending procedures the Government prepared a sample \nof road connectivity subprojects, which have been appraised by ADB and will serve as a model in \npreparing additional subprojects during project implementation. A total of 174 sample subprojects \ncovering 1,046 km of all-weather roads were prepared in 14 districts of CG and 11 districts of MP. \nStudies examined the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of each sample subproject, \nand identified environmental and social impacts and mitigation measures required. A technical \ndescription of sample subprojects is in Appendix 6.  \n \n32.  Additional subprojects will be prepared for approval during project implementation, in \naccordance with the selection criteria and approval procedures given in Appendix 7. Subprojects \nwill be required to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion under PMGSY, and will be grouped in \narea clusters comprising priority link roads together with the through roads required to connect to \nthe state road network. The selection criteria establish requirements for subprojects in terms of (i) \neligibility  for  road  connectivity  investment  in  accordance  with  PMGSY  guidelines;  (ii) \npreparedness and adherence to technical specifications; (iii) road safety audit of subproject \ndesigns; (iv) economic returns; and (v) compliance with ADB safeguard policies and guidelines on \nsocial impacts, land acquisition and resettlement, gender, indigenous peoples, and environmental \naspects.  \n \n33.  The  road  connectivity  investments  will  be  implemented  in  four  annual  batches. \nExpenditures in each batch will be shared equally by CG and MP. The first batch will consist of \nthe roughly 1,000 km of sample subprojects that were prepared with TA assistance (para. 25). \nAbout 10,000 km of additional subprojects will be implemented in the second, third, and fourth \nbatches, with about 3,300 km in each batch. The approval procedures require the implementing \nagencies (para. 50) to prepare the annual batches of additional subprojects well in time to provide \nADB with completed checklists summarizing the eligibility, preparation status, and compliance \nwith safeguards of each subproject. The loan-financed consulting services will assist in preparing \nthe additional subprojects and in implementing all subprojects.  \n \n2.  Asset Management and Capacity Building Component \n34.  The Project will assist the governments of CG and MP to establish the procedures, \nfinancing arrangements, and institutional capacity to ensure the sustainability over their useful \neconomic lives of road assets created under PMGSY. Consulting services will assist state \ngovernments and zilla panchayats (footnote 9) in establishing road maintenance budgeting, \nplanning and management systems; will develop standard performance-based contracts for road \nmaintenance; and will support capacity building and provide on-the-job training. The assistance \nwill enable the state governments and zilla panchayats to serve as strategic managers of their \nPMGSY rural roads networks, with detailed professional and technical studies and supervision, \nand all civil works outsourced to the private sector. The Project will also finance the procurement \nof vehicles and equipment needed for managing road maintenance at the district level. \n \n35.  On the basis of the policy dialogue during project preparation, the state governments have \nentered into commitments to provide the levels of annual financing required for sustainable \nmaintenance, as reflected in the Loan covenants: (i) the government of CG will annually provide \nin its state budget financing to maintain the PMGSY rural roads network, from about Rs96 million \n   ", "  9 \n($2.1 million equivalent) in 2006/07 to about Rs956 million ($20.6 million equivalent) in 2010/11; \n(ii) the government of MP will make annual budget allocations and also earmark its income from \nmandi cess, for financing the maintenance of all PMGSY roads, from about Rs80 million ($1.7 \nmillion equivalent) in 2006/07 to about Rs1.02 billion ($22.0 million equivalent) in 2012/13; (iii) \nboth  states  will  exercise  the  option  under  the  PMGSY  construction  contracts  to  retain  the \ncontractor to maintain the roads built for the initial period of 5 years operations after completion of \nconstruction of each road (para. 96); and (iv) before the end of the initial 5-year maintenance \nperiods, both states will assign responsibility for maintaining PMGSY roads to zilla panchayats \nand assign the state financing for PMGSY roads [(items (ii) and (iii)] to them; (v) drawing on the \nstandard performance-based contracts developed under consulting services (para. 34), zilla \npanchayats in both states will enter into further maintenance contracts to start upon completion of \nthe initial 5-year maintenance periods and to cover maintenance of all PMGSY roads for further \nperiods of not less than 5 years (para. 99); and (vi) the increases in maintenance financing will be \nprovided through additional budget appropriations or increases in mandi cess16 by the state \ngovernments,  and  will  not  be  financed  by  reducing  budgets  for  maintaining  other  roads. \nConsulting services will also assist the states to develop proposals for zilla panchayats to collect \na community contribution for the cost of road maintenance. Within the limits of affordability to rural \ncommunities, this will introduce a user-pays approach to road maintenance, and in so doing \nstrengthen communities\u2019 sense of ownership over the road assets created. \n \n36.  Additional support will be provided for PMGSY training and capacity building at national \nlevel through NRRDA. This will focus on improving management skills for PIU and zilla panchayat \nstaff by developing systems for managing road maintenance, providing training by consultants \nand domestic training institutions, and providing for study visits in India and outside India. \n \n37.  In accordance with the programmatic approach for highway sector lending adopted in \nADB\u2019s India CSP, the Project includes an assurance to address the critical overall issue of \nproviding for road maintenance in the overall PMGSY program. This is intended to serve as a \ntrigger for processing of the proposed Rural Roads Sector II Project, tentatively scheduled for \n2005.  By  that  time,  to  strengthen  the  overall  sustainability  of  PMGSY,  MORD  will  have \nprogressed in its dialogue with the states participating in PMGSY with regard to making adequate \nplans and financing arrangements and commitments to properly maintain their PMGSY road \nnetwork over its useful economic life (para. 102).  \n \n38.  To mitigate the risk of road crashes and injury, the Project will support NRRDA in its \nongoing work to develop road safety audit for PMGSY, and will help to introduce community road \nsafety  programs  in  CG  and  MP.  As  part  of  consulting  services  for  the  road  connectivity \ncomponent (para. 55), a road safety audit will be conducted for all road connectivity subprojects, \nand  measures  to  mitigate  accident  hazards  will  be  incorporated  in  the  subproject  designs. \nGovernment-financed consulting services will develop road safety audit procedures to eventually \nbe specified by NRRDA for inclusion in the appropriate stages of the PMGSY road construction \nprocess, and develop a community-level approach to rural road safety in CG and MP, targeting \nroad users living in the project road areas of influence, initially those closest to state and national \nhighways. The community rural road safety program will begin with a start-up phase where \ncampaign products will be developed before moving to an expanded implementation phase \nwhere village-level panchayats will conduct campaigns to reach program sustainability. Capacity \nbuilding, research, and evaluation will be undertaken as the program develops to provide a model \nfor other jurisdictions.  \n                                                 \n16  Mandi Cess, a tax on sales of produce through agricultural marketing boards, will be used in MP. Since agricultural \nproducers will be among the main users of PMGSY roads and will benefit roughly in proportion to the volumes of \nproduce they transport to market, this is considered an appropriate funding source.  \n   ", "10   \n \n39.  Both road safety audit and community road safety are consistent with the national road \nsafety  policy  and  strategic  road  safety  implementation  directions  for  the  states.  The  latter \nrepresents a new road safety initiative in India where a scientific and programmatic approach has \nnot previously been evident. The rural road safety subcomponent is expected to contribute to \nstrengthening road safety provisions within PMGSY (details are in Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nC.  Special Features \n40.  The Project will establish both the financial and contractual commitments necessary to \nensure that assets created will be adequately maintained. In addition to establishing the capacity \nfor planning and managing rural road maintenance under the Project, the two state governments \nhave  committed  the  estimated  levels  of  financing  required  for  proper  maintenance  of  their \nPMGSY road networks, and will enter into contractual commitments under the construction \ncontracts and subsequent maintenance contracts to maintain these networks for at least 10 \nyears.  \n \n41.  The subproject selection criteria incorporate provisions for enhancing poverty reduction \nimpact in very poor and remote areas. Due to previous isolation from the rest of the economy and \nlow initial starting point for economic development, it is often difficult to reliably quantify the full \neconomic benefits of improving roads in such areas. At the same time, they may be among the \nareas that need improved road connectivity most.17 To address their needs, up to 15% of \nexpenditures on each annual batch of road connectivity subprojects in each state will be allocated \nto such areas on the basis of a weighting of socioeconomic indicators of economic potential, \nincidence of poverty, and difficulty of access.  \n \n42.  The Project offers a unique opportunity to document the impacts of rural roads on poverty \nreduction and human development in India since (i) it will construct a large number of rural roads; \n(ii) each road subproject will generally be completed and opened to traffic in about a year, so that \nduring the project implementation period it will be possible to examine impacts for the period \nimmediately  before  improvement  to  3-4  years  after  improvement;  and  (iii)  existing  PMGSY \nplanning and monitoring procedures already provide a useful initial database for all roads, and \nPIUs have close contacts and cooperation with panchayat institutions and communities being \nassisted. The consulting services for the road connectivity component will include a monitoring \nstudy to document the socioeconomic impact of the component in CG and MP. This will be based \non preparation of pre-improvement baseline data for project roads and control roads, annual \nupdating of data, and periodic review and community consultations to track and verify the change \nprocess due to the improved road connectivity. This will include support for training and capacity \nbuilding for state-level research institutions. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n \n43.  Drawing  upon  the  successful  implementation  arrangements  identified  in  MP,  during \nproject formulation the CG government became the second state to establish a rural roads \ndevelopment agency to be responsible for implementing PMGSY in the state. The agency was \nestablished as a nonprofit organization under the Firms and Societies Act and has sufficient \nautonomy to be able to concentrate on ensuring effective, efficient implementation of PMGSY. Its \nstaff comprise a small group of professionals who will manage and oversee the implementation \nactivities. Road construction and supervision will be outsourced to contractors and consultants. \nThese arrangements are expected to enhance PMGSY implementation performance and avoid \nthe problem of staff overhang when PMGSY is completed in CG. \n                                                 \n17  In fact, PMGSY treats road connectivity as a universal basic need for all habitations of eligible size. \n   ", " 11 \n \n44.  As an additional feature, the Project includes road safety measures targeted at mitigating \nthe accident risks associated with project road connectivity improvements. The measures may be \nexpected to be highly pro-poor since more than half of accident victims are pedestrians. It will \nalso help establish a basis for wider application of road safety measures linked to specific road \nconnectivity investments, including for PMGSY, other highways projects in India, and for ADB \nroad sector lending in general. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n45.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $571 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, \nduties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction (Table 1). The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $269.1 million (47%). The local currency cost (including taxes and \nduties) is estimated at $301.9 million equivalent (53%).

Financing Plan \n46.  The Government has requested a loan of $400,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5%, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n47.  The loan will finance the foreign exchange cost \u2013 excluding the front-end fee, interest and \nother charges on the Loan during construction18\u2013 and $170.6 million of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will finance the foreign exchange costs comprising the front-end fee, interest \nand other charges on the loan during construction, and the local currency costs of $131.3 million. \nThe Government will provide the Loan proceeds in local currency to MORD and the state \n                                                 \n18  Front-end fee, interest during construction, and commitment fees will be paid separately by the Government. \n   ", "12   \ngovernments of CG and MP on a grant basis. The Government will bear the foreign exchange \nrisk on the Loan.19 The financing plan for the Project is in Table 2.  \n \n48.  Financing  of  the  local  currency  cost  is  justified  since  the  Project  is  important  for \naddressing  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objective  of  poverty  reduction  in  India.  PMGSY  is  one  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  main  programs  for  poverty  reduction,  and  the  rural  roads  infrastructure  it  is \ndeveloping will contribute significantly to a host of other poverty reduction activities, and increase \nthe effectiveness of other ADB assistance to reduce poverty in India. Having determined the \nimportance of rural roads for poverty reduction, the Government has initiated a very large \nprogram that it can only partially finance from fuel taxes and budgetary sources. Financing from \nADB and other external sources is required to make good the severe deficit in rural connectivity \nwithin the present decade.  \n \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total  % \n         \nAsian Development Bank  229.4  170.6  400.0    70 \nGovernment a  39.7  131.3  171.0    30 \n  Total  269.1  301.9  571.0    100 \n   a \nIncluding taxes and duties, front-end fee, interest during construction, and commitment fees. \n \n \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  The Executing Agencies (EAs) for the Project will be MORD at the central level and the \nrespective state governments at the state level. MORD will be responsible for overall supervision \nand execution of the Project, particularly the road connectivity component, and support for \ncapacity building at the central level. The state governments, through their respective rural \ndevelopment departments, will be responsible for executing the Project at the state level.20 The \nMORD joint secretary will chair a project coordination committee, to be set up by the Government \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. The committee will monitor the use of loan funds and \noverall implementation performance. The committee members will comprise senior officials of \nMORD, the Department of Economic Affairs, NRRDA, and the governments of CG and MP. The \nrespective state-level standing committees as set up under the PMGSY guidelines will assist in \noverseeing and monitoring timely completion of the Project. Both committees will meet quarterly. \nThe implementation setup is shown in Appendix 9. \n \n50.  At the national level, PMGSY is administered by MORD through the National Rural Roads \nDevelopment Agency (NRRDA). At state level, the implementing agencies (IAs) for the Project \nwill be the Chhattisgarh Rural Roads Development Agency (CGRRDA) and the Madhya Pradesh \n                                                 \n19  As required under the PMGSY guidelines, the proceeds will be provided directly by MORD to the implementing \nagencies (para. 50) established by the governments of CG and MP for that purpose. \n20  This will be Chhattisgarh Rural Roads Development Agency for CG and Madhya Pradesh Rural Development \nAuthority for MP. \n   ", " 13 \nRural Roads Development Authority (MPRRDA).21 CGRRDA and MPRRDA will each be headed \nby  a  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  who  will  be  the  state-level  project  director  for  overall \ncoordination  of  implementation,  including  planning,  management,  consultant  selection,  and \nprocurement. The CEO will be supported by experienced personnel at headquarters and in the \nPIUs established to support PMGSY implementation. In MP there are 27 PIUs, each covering 1\u20133 \ndistricts.22 In CG there are 16 PIUs, each covering one district.  \n \n51.  To monitor project performance and use of funds at the state level, and to ensure \ncoordination among the key agencies involved, the two state governments will each establish a \nstate-level  project  implementation  committee  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  These \ncommittees will meet on a monthly basis, chaired by the CEO of the IA, with representation from \nthe respective state rural development department,23 PIUs, and consultants. As necessary, other \nstate agencies, may be invited to this committee to assist in implementing the Project in areas \nsuch as forestry, land acquisition etc.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years inclusive of preconstruction activities. The \nscheduled completion date for civil works is December 2007. The first batch of subprojects (the \nsample subprojects) will be ready for contract award in July 2004. The IAs will prepare detailed \nimplementation schedules for the remaining three batches of subprojects to be agreed during the \nInception Mission. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n53.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts over $3 million will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB), and those estimated to cost $3 million or less will be \nprocured through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. LCB contract \npackages will be in the range of $1 million\u20133 million, except that packages in the range of $0.5 \nmillion\u20131 million will be permitted for up to 10% of estimated expenditures on each annual batch \nof road connectivity subprojects in each state.24 Civil works will be procured among prequalified \nbidders. In the case of LCB, prequalification will be based on the single-stage, two-envelope \nsystem. Equipment will be procured by ICB for contracts for an estimated value of more than \n$500,000,  international  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  at  $100,000\u2013500,000,  and  direct \npurchase arrangement for contracts valued at less than $100,000. Indicative contract packages \nfor sample subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix D. Contract packages for additional \nsubprojects will be decided during implementation, based on the approach used for the sample \nsubprojects.  \n \n                                                 \n21  MPRRDA was established in 2000 as a nonprofit organization under the Firms and Societies Act for the purpose of \nimplementing PMGSY. Its staff focus on planning and managing PMGSY. Design, supervision, and civil works are \noutsourced to private consultants and contractors. Outsourcing was adopted both to ensure the quality and value for \nmoney of works undertaken and to avoid creating a large establishment that would become underemployed once the \nmain PMGSY activities are completed. In addition to statutory audit by the Auditor and Comptroller General, \nMPRRDA prepares commercial accounts and is audited by private sector auditors. CGRRDA was established in \n2003 on a similar basis to MPRRDA. \n22  There are 45 districts in MP. The number of PIUs reflects MP\u2019s large size and poor accessibility by road in rural \nareas.  \n23  The Chhattisgarh Department of Panchayat and Rural Development and Madhya Pradesh Rural Development \nDepartment. \n24  This exception will address the possibility of needing smaller packages in some more remote areas. \n   ", "14   \n54.  To support timely contract approvals while ensuring sound practice and accountability, \npost facto approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works contracts.25 For the first five \ncontract packages under LCB in each state, the IA will submit the procurement documents and \nbid evaluation for  ADB review and approval before awarding the contract. If ADB finds the \nprocurement documents and bid evaluation for the first five contract packages satisfactory, the IA \nwill proceed with procurement procedures and contract award for subsequent contract packages \nwithout  prior  ADB  review  and  approval.  In  these  cases  the  following  post  facto  approval \nprocedures will apply: (i) the IA will retain a record of all procurement documentation, including \ncopies of the signed contract and the bid evaluation report, to be available for inspection; (ii) at \nthe time of each contract award the IA will provide ADB with a certified summary sheet reporting \non the main aspects of the bid evaluation and contract award; (iii) the procurement processes and \ncontract awards will be audited annually as part of the performance audit (para. 61); and (iv) if \nany contract award is found to be unacceptable, ADB may refuse to finance the contract. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n55.  International  and  domestic  consulting  services  will  assist  the  EAs  and  the  IAs  to \nimplement the Project. Project implementation consultants (PICs) will assist the two IAs in (i) \npreparing additional subprojects; (ii) supervising civil works; (iii) implementing land acquisition \nplans and mitigating other social impacts as required; (iv) grievance redress for resolution of any \ndisputes in respect of land acquisition or any other social impacts; and (v) implementing and \nmonitoring environmental management plans (EMPs). Three PICs will be recruited in CG and \nthree in MP, and each PIC will be responsible for implementing the four annual batches of the \nProject for an area covering about a third of the respective state. Each PIC is expected to cover \nabout six PIUs in CG and about nine in MP. The PICs will be recruited from consulting firms \nbased in India with substantial international experience. Outline terms of reference for the PICs \nare in Supplementary Appendix E. A project management consultant (PMC) will assist MORD \nthrough NRRDA in (i) overall project management and coordination at the national level; and (ii) \ndeveloping and implementing support for capacity building and training for PMGSY and related \nagencies such as NRRDA at the national level and the IAs and panchayats at the state levels. \nThe PMC will assist the two state EAs in (i) screening and processing additional subprojects for \nsubmission to ADB; (ii) procuring training services; (iii) project management and coordination at \nstate  levels,  including  overseeing  compliance  with  safeguard  policies  (in  relation  to  land \nacquisition/ resettlement, environment, gender, social impacts, HIV/AIDs,26 child labor, etc.); (iv) \nestablishing road maintenance budgeting, planning and management systems for use by zilla \npanchayats,  developing  standard  performance  based  contracts  for  road  maintenance,  and \nproviding  capacity  building  support  for  zilla  panchayats  and  on-the-job  training  to  the  PIU \npersonnel and zilla panchayats; (v) project performance management and monitoring; and (vi) \nmonitoring of socioeconomic impacts (para. 42). The PMC will be recruited from international \nfirms  in  association  with  domestic  experts.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  PMC  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F.  Government-financed road safety consulting services will assist \nMORD to incorporate road safety audit within PMGSY, and assist the two state governments to \ndevelop community-based road safety activities.  \n \n56.  The  state  governments  will  recruit  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  conduct \nindependent monitoring and verification of land acquisition and indigenous peoples aspects of the \nProject. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix G. In addition consultants will \nbe recruited to carry out performance audits annually (para. 61). \n \n                                                 \n25  Such procedures are consistent with PAI 3.04 para. 10. \n26 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n   ", " 15 \n57.  Loan-financed consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures for recruiting firms under full technical proposals and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. ADB endorsed advance \naction for recruiting consulting services on the understanding that such approval would not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nJanuary 2001, and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Product, \nJuly 2002. For ICB civil works, procurement of equipment and consulting services, loan funds will \nbe  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures.  For  LCB  civil  works, \nreimbursement procedures will be through the imprest account. MORD will operate an imprest \naccount at the Reserve Bank of India with an initial advance of $20 million. Thereafter the total \nimprest at any time will not exceed estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is lower. Each IA will operate a second generation imprest account in a \nbank acceptable to ADB in the state, with an initial advance of $9 million. Thereafter the amount \nin each second generation imprest account at any time will not exceed estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months or 5% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. MORD will be responsible for \nmonitoring  the  two  IAs\u2019  imprest  accounts,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  accounts  and \npreparation of withdrawal applications for liquidation/replenishment of the accounts. Statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedures will be used for individual payments of less than $100,000. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  The EAs and IAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the \ngoods and services financed from the loan proceeds, the expenditures incurred for the Project \nand  the  subprojects,  and  use  of  local  funds.  These  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by independent \nprivate auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit to ADB within 9 months after the \nend of each fiscal year consolidated annual audited reports and related financial statements of \nthe Project, identifying separate accounts of subprojects as required for CG and MP. The audit of \nthe imprest account and second generation imprest accounts and SOE will be carried out as part \nof the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of that part of the examination relating to the \nimprest accounts and SOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. \n \n60.  Since the PMGSY guidelines require state governments to engage chartered accountants \nof standing to audit PMGSY accounts, wherever possible the same auditors that audit CGRRDA \nand MPRRDA will audit project and subproject accounts in each state subject to these auditors\u2019 \nacceptability to ADB.  \n \n61.  For transparency in all procurement-related activities, and objective and independent \nassessment  of  such  activities,  all  procurement  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent \nperformance audits. Loan-financed consulting services recruited through ICB will conduct the \nperformance  audit  annually.  ADB  will  also  conduct  project  procurement  audits  during \nimplementation as part of its regular review process. \n \n62.  The IAs will submit to MORD, through the relevant state government, monthly progress \nreports of subproject implementation under the road connectivity component, in such form and \ndetail as required. Likewise, the state governments will submit to MORD quarterly progress \nreports  for  the  asset  management  and  capacity  building  component  and  the  road  safety \n   ", "16   \nsubcomponent. Based on these reports, MORD, with assistance from NRRDA, will further submit \nto ADB consolidated overall project performance reports on a quarterly basis. The quarterly report \nwill  summarize  the  information  in  the  detailed  reports,  including  basic  data,  use  of  funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, and major issues and problems.  \n \n63.  Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will submit to ADB \na project completion report with a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 and \nconsultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic rate of return, and other details \nfor each state as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n64.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MORD through the IAs will establish a capability for \nsystematic project performance monitoring (PPM) and analysis throughout the life of the Project, \nintegrated with their management information system. The PPM will be developed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System Handbook. Initially, the PPM will develop \nand conduct a \u201cquick and easy\u201d rapid sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent \nperformance monitoring. Thereafter, surveys will be conducted annually. The scope of the survey, \nquantity and quality of data, and frequency for collection will be guided primarily by the project \nmanagement\u2019s need for progressive rapid feedback on implementation status, as well as early \nwarning of impending situations that might jeopardize attainment of the development objectives. \nThe key indicators and assumptions outlined at the output and development objective (i.e., \npurpose and goal) levels in the project framework will form the core of the data required for rapid \nassessment. The monitoring data on traffic levels, and poverty and socioeconomic impacts will be \nbased on the reports of the impact monitoring study to be carried out by the PMC (para. 42). \n \n8.  Project Review \n65.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, there will be a detailed midterm review (MTR) \nof  the  Project.  The  MTR  will  identify  any  problems  or  weaknesses  in  implementation \narrangements, and agree on any changes needed to achieve the project objectives. Based on the \nproject schedule, the MTR will be carried out around June 2005. Two months before the MTR, \nthe Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on project implementation. Terms \nof reference for the MTR will be included in the project administration memorandum to be \nprepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n66.  An accompanying project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will be provided for the \nRural Roads Sector II Project. The TA will cover (i) preparation of further investment for improving \nrural  roads  under  PMGSY,  including  a  review  of  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  PMGSY; \n(ii) institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  requirements;  and  (iii) formulation  of \nassociated support for road safety. The EA for the TA will be MORD. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $1.25 million equivalent.  The Government of the United Kingdom will finance $1 \nmillion equivalent, on a grant basis, including all the foreign exchange costs ($327,800) and part \nof the local currency costs. The proposed in-kind contribution of  $250,000 equivalent from the \nGovernment of India will cover the costs of office accommodation, transport, and counterpart \nstaff. The outline terms of reference and cost estimates are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n67.  The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants in association with \ndomestic  consultants,  together  with  individual  international  and  domestic  consultants.  Their \n   ", " 17 \nexpertise  will  cover  road  engineering,  institutional  strengthening,  poverty  analysis,  transport \neconomics, social analysis, land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental assessment. \nThe consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures. \nThe individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Policy and Institutional Improvements \n68.  The  proposed  support  for  asset  management  and  capacity  building,  including  the \ncommitment of required levels of maintenance financing and establishment of systems and \ncapacity within zilla panchayats, will help ensure that created rural roads assets will be sustained \nover their useful economic lives. Since PMGSY is expected to eventually create new assets of \n$11 billion, the asset management improvements under the Project in CG and MP and the \nprogrammatic approach of leveraging similar improvements throughout PMGSY, are expected to \nbe significant to the overall success of PMGSY. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n69.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with-project \nand without-project scenarios for about 800 km of subproject roads in 19 districts. Without the \nProject, transport costs to and from rural habitations will remain very high. With the Project, \ntransport costs will be significantly reduced, leading to savings for existing traffic, rapid growth in \ngenerated traffic, and a shift in traffic composition toward more efficient, motorized modes. There \nwill also be reduced spoilage of agricultural produce on the way to the market. \n \n70.  Classified traffic counts were provided by the governments of CG and MP and verified \nthrough field surveys and traffic surveys. Traffic on most subproject roads averaged around 100 \nvehicles per day: 40-50% motorized and 50-60% nonmotorized. For existing traffic, growth rates \nfor freight were based on an analysis of gross domestic product and the income elasticity of \ntransport demand. Passenger traffic growth rates were based on population growth rate, per \ncapita income growth, and the income elasticity of transport demand. The traffic growth rates \nadopted varied between 4 and 9% per annum, depending on the vehicle type. Based on the \naverage vehicle composition for the sample subproject roads, overall traffic growth rate was \napproximately 7% for 2003-2010 and 6.3% for 2010-2024. Estimates of generated traffic were \nbased on the reduction in vehicle operating costs by vehicle type and the associated price \nelasticity of demand. Additional traffic induced by the expansion of local economic activity was \nconservatively estimated from analysis of before- and after-improvement surveys for completed \nPMGSY roads, after allowing for existing traffic and generated traffic.  \n \n71.  The economic costs of the Project include the resource costs for construction, operation \nand maintenance, and the social costs of compensation for land acquisition. The economic \nbenefits were quantified in terms of (i) vehicle operating cost savings, (ii) passenger time savings, \nand (iii) reduced spoilage of agricultural produce.  \n \n72.  The estimated overall EIRR for the sample subprojects is 26.6%. The EIRRs for the 19 \ndistrict clusters of sample subprojects ranged from 13.0% to 60.9%. Sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the Project will be economically viable under adverse scenarios, including increased costs, \n   ", "18   \ndecreased  benefits,  and  implementation  delays.  The  economic  analysis  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 11. Further details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nC.  Social Impact \n1.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n73.  The 2001 census reported that CG had a population of 20.8 million, of whom 16.6 million \nor 80% lived in rural areas. MP\u2019s population was 81.2 million, with 60.9 million or 75% in rural \nareas.  The  combined  population  of  the  two  states  was  equivalent  to  10%  of  the  national \npopulation. With a combined poverty head count rate of 37.4% in 1999-200027 MP and CG are \namong the poorest states in India.28 Based on a range of poverty and human development \nindicators\u2014including  poverty  rate,  life  expectancy,  infant  mortality\u2014there  is  little  doubt  that \npeople living in these two states suffer from levels of poverty, disadvantage, and deprivation that \nare well above the national average.29  \n \n74.  Rural inaccessibility is one of the major reasons for poverty and deprivation in the two \nstates. Their large rural populations are widely dispersed, making road connectivity a particularly \ncritical factor for people to avail themselves of economic opportunities and social services.30 \nHowever, past neglect of the road network has been especially severe in these states. Studies \nconducted  during  the  preparation  of  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  MP  State  Roads  Sector \nDevelopment Project (footnote 13) found that outdated institutional arrangements had led to most \nof the state road sector budget being spent on personnel costs instead of on maintaining and \ndeveloping the roads. The 2001 National Human Development Report found that in 1996/97 only \n22% of habitations under 1,000 persons in MP had road connections, the lowest road connectivity \namong the states. \n \n75.  The Project is categorized as a poverty intervention. By focusing on states that are among \nIndia\u2019s poorest and by serving the rural parts of these states where poverty is highest, the Project \nis carefully targeted at areas that are predominantly poor. By providing rural habitations with good \nall-weather road connections for the first time, the Project will address one of the main underlying \ncauses of poverty and deprivation in CG and MP. By building in strong provisions to ensure the \nsustainability of the roads to be built, the Project will provide a lasting instrument for enabling \npeople to lift themselves out of poverty. As is well documented,31 such support will have direct \nimpacts on poverty reduction in the immediate project influence areas by providing people with \naccess to economic opportunities, links to better priced markets, employment opportunities, and \nbetter quality social and other services, as well as short-term project-related employment. Equally \nimportant,  it  will  have  important  indirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction.  Improved  transport \nefficiency and extension of the transport network will contribute to overall economic growth in the \ntwo states, leading to increases in incomes and employment opportunities and generating higher \ntax revenues to support the state governments\u2019 other programs for economic growth, poverty \nreduction, and human development.  \n \n                                                 \n27 Government of India. 2001. Poverty Estimates for 1999-2000. Press Information Bureau.  \n28  Until 2000, CG was part of MP. Most available poverty and human indicators refer to the former MP inclusive of CG.  \n29  The states\u2019 poverty head count rate is 37.4%, compared with the national average of 26%. Life expectancy of 56.8 \nyears for men and 57.2 years compares with the national averages of 62.4 years for men and 63.4 years for women. \nTheir infant mortality rate of 90 deaths per 1,000 live births compares with a national average of 70. They also have a \nsubstantially higher proportion of scheduled tribes (STs) and scheduled castes (SCs). In MP 35.3% of the population \nare STs or SCs, compared with 24.5% nationally. The proportion of STs and SCs in CG is believed to be higher than \nthat in MP. \n30  In 2001 the population density of MP was 192 per km2, compared with 324 nationally.  \n31  An extensive range of sources is cited in the India Country Strategy and Program. \n   ", " 19 \n76.  During project formulation, case studies were conducted to compare before and after, and \nwith and without rural roads improvements completed over the past 5 years in MP and CG. The \nresults are summarized in Appendix 12. Further details are in Supplementary Appendix J. The \ncase studies confirm the mechanisms through which the Project may be expected to contribute to \npoverty reduction, including (i) growth in agricultural incomes due to access to higher priced \nmarkets, ability for the first time to transport horticultural and other higher value produce to \nmarkets, and reduced spoilage; (ii) growth of the local economy, leading to increased incomes \nand employment opportunities; (iii) the ability to travel to take up jobs outside of the habitation or \nresidence; (iv) reduction in prices of consumer goods and services due to lower transport cost; (v) \nimproved health and longevity due to access to hospitals and health services (including access to \nhospitals  at  time  of  delivery);  (vi)  improved  education  due  to  improved  access  to  schools \n(including postprimary schooling), improved capacity to attract qualified school teachers, and \nmore frequent supervision visits by school inspectors; (vii) improved access to agricultural, \nveterinary, and extension services; and (viii) improved opportunities for participating in the wider \nsociety outside of people\u2019s home villages.  \n \n77.  The beneficiaries of the Project will be the bulk of the rural population of the two states: (i) \ndirect users of road transport, including owners/operators of buses and trucks, passengers of the \nvarious vehicle categories, labor, and the Government; (ii) those benefiting indirectly because \nthey live in the area of influence of the roads; and (iii) those benefiting indirectly through the wider \nimpacts of higher economic growth in their districts and in the states as a whole. \n \n2.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n78.  Distribution  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  extent  that  the  direct  economic \nbenefits quantified in the economic analysis (para. 71) would accrue to poor people, and to \nestimate the poverty impact ratio for the sample subprojects. Initially estimates were made of the \ndistribution of the quantified benefits to the various categories of road users (bus and truck \noperators/owners; bus passengers; car, utility, and motorcycle owners, drivers, and passengers; \nand users of bicycles and animal-drawn vehicles). A user survey was then conducted to establish \nthe proportion of the poor among passenger users, freight users, and vehicle owners/operators. \nThe poor represented 80% of all passengers using transport facilities, about 50% of people using \nfreight services, and 75% of owners of nonmotorized vehicles such as bicycles. The estimated \npoverty impact ratio was 1.32, indicating that the total net economic benefits reaching the poor \nwill exceed the total net economic benefits of the Project.32 This strongly indicates that the Project \nis  highly  pro-poor.  This  analysis  is  explained  in  detail  in  Appendix  11 and Supplementary \nAppendix I. \n \n3.  Gender \n79.  Gender  assessment  conducted  as  part  of  the  socioeconomic  and  poverty  analysis \nimpacts found that transport connectivity can contribute in establishing the conditions for raising \nthe  social,  educational,  and  health  status  of  women.  Better  transport  services  open  up \nopportunities for more girls to attend postprimary schools outside the village. They also contribute \nto safe motherhood by providing access to better health services outside the village and reducing \nthe obstacles to improved health services within the village. Women interviewed referred to the \npsychological benefit of being able to maintain more frequent contact with their families in distant \nlocations. The extent that potential gender benefits are realized will be affected by social and \n                                                 \n32  The poor will receive most of the gross economic benefits, but contribute only a small share of gross investment \ncosts.  \n   ", "20   \ncultural factors, such as cultural constraints that may restrict female mobility beyond the village, \nand poor people\u2019s perceptions of the opportunity cost of educating girls compared with boys. \n \n4.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n80.  A social assessment and a 20% sample survey of households were undertaken for 33 \nsample subprojects with a combined length of 247 km. In CG, nine subprojects in two districts \n(Bastar and Mahasamund), with a length of 105 km, were covered. In MP, 24 subprojects in four \ndistricts  (Bhopal,  Sehore,  Guna,  and  Sidhi),  with  a  length  of  142  km,  were  covered.  Field \nverification confirmed that the width of the existing roads, originally built by panchayat/village \nauthorities on revenue (government) land, will be sufficient to accommodate the 7.5 m right-of-\nway to be improved through the Project. As a result, construction of the project roads will require \nminimal acquisition of land, only for shoulder adjustment and drainage.   \n \n81.  The subprojects surveyed in CG require acquisition of 22 hectares from 192 households. \nAbout 32 households will experience loss of 10-15% of frontage of structures due to road \nwidening through the village. In MP the subprojects surveyed require acquisition of 4 hectares of \nland for minor adjustments in road shoulders and drainage. An estimated 429 households will \nlose agricultural land. The average loss of agricultural land will be only 3.15 square meters per \nhousehold, compared with an average farm size of 2 hectares. On average only three families per \nkm will be affected.  \n \n82.  Based on the social assessment, a land acquisition plan (LAP) was prepared for the \nsample subprojects. The plan is guided by the Government\u2019s land acquisition laws/regulations \nand ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. It stipulates \neligibility and provisions for various types of losses (land, crops/trees, and structures). In India, \nparticularly under PMGSY, due to the economic benefits and increased value of land property \nfrom improved roads, voluntary land contribution by affected households is common practice in \nacquiring land for improvement of rural roads. The Project will provide three options for mitigating \nimpacts: (i) voluntary land contribution, (ii) replacement land, and (iii) cash compensation. The \nentitlement matrix establishes the parameters for mitigating the range of losses likely to be \nexperienced by the households. Households headed by females and other vulnerable households \nwill be eligible for further cash assistance. The summary LAP for sample subprojects is in \nSupplementary  Appendix  K.  For  additional  subprojects  requiring  land  acquisition,  a  land \nacquisition framework (LAF) was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for sector \nloans. The LAF presents the policy and procedures for preparing LAPs in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement. The LAF is in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n83.  More  than  25%  of  the  population  of  the  project  influence  area  are  indigenous \npeoples/STs. In the past, STs depended on forest resources for food. Most are now subsistence \nfarmers. Nearly 40% of people in the influence area of the subprojects in Sidhi are STs. For the \nother sample subprojects the proportion of STs in the influence area is generally less than 10%. \nBecause  of  poor  transport  infrastructure,  many  STs  have  limited  access  to  regular  market \neconomy, agricultural extension, and health and education services. Lack of market access, \nhealth problems, and illiteracy remain the principal causes of their poverty and vulnerability. By \nimproving access, the sample subprojects will help reduce poverty and improve the human \ndevelopment status of STs. No negative impacts are expected. Land acquisition will not be \nrequired  for  the  sample  subprojects  in  areas  with  a  high  proportion  of  STs  as  the  road \nconnectivity improvements will be on the existing road alignments. For any additional subprojects \nthat could have adverse impacts on STs, an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) \nwas developed to guide subproject preparation (Supplementary Appendix M). The framework \n   ", " 21 \nwas prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s requirements for sector loans and ADB\u2019s indigenous \npeoples policy.   \n \n84.  The PICs will include expertise to assist the states in implementing the LAPs and IPDPs. \nNGOs will be separately recruited to independently monitor and verify implementation of LAPs \nand IPDPs (para. 56).33 \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n85.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) for the sample subprojects found that there \nwill be only minor negative environmental impacts associated with the project road investments. \nThe environmental monitoring and management plan included in the IEE provides for mitigation \nof such adverse impacts. The mitigation measures will be incorporated into the subproject \ndesigns and followed during Project construction, operation and maintenance; the IAs, assisted \nby  the  PICs,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  implementation  of  the  measures.  The  IEE \nconcluded that the mitigation measures are manageable, and therefore a full environmental \nimpact assessment is not required. The summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n \n86.  Assisted by the PICs, the IAs will prepare an overall IEE for each annual batch of \nadditional  subprojects  in  their  respective  states,  focusing  on  any  environmental  problems \nidentified and mitigation required. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n87.  The  risk  of  nonsustainability  of  the  Project  due  to  inadequate  maintenance  will  be \naddressed by the asset management and capacity building component. This component will \nestablish systems for planning and executing road maintenance under contract, and the state \ngovernments have agreed to earmark sufficient funding to meet the estimated maintenance \ncosts.  The  component  will  also  ensure  that  the  state  governments  enter  into  contractual \ncommitments to maintain the entire PMGSY rural roads network, including the project road \ninvestments, for at least 10 years of operations.   \n \n88.  The risk of implementation delays has been addressed by establishing a rural roads \ndevelopment  agency  in  each  state  to  act  as  IA.  The  IA  will  have  authority  to  decide  on \nimplementation including procurement, suitably qualified core staff to manage implementation \neffectively, and sufficient resources to engage consultants and contractors to perform the main \nengineering and civil works tasks. The performance of the MPRRDA in terms of quantity and \nquality of PMGSY roads constructed has confirmed the advantage of this arrangement compared \nwith implementation by state government departments. To avoid the risk of overextending the \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  IAs,  consultants,  and  contractors,  the  level  of  annual road \nconnectivity expenditure under the Project will be similar to that already achieved by the two \nstates under PMGSY. \n \n89.  The economic analysis of the investment component suggests no significant economic \nrisks. The criteria for selecting subprojects will ensure that each package of subprojects will have \nan EIRR of at least 10-12%. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the project will be \neconomically viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios.  \n \n90.  The risk of adverse social and environmental impacts has been addressed in the criteria \nand  procedures  for  subproject  selection  and  preparation.  The  risk  of  road  connectivity \n                                                 \n33  The NGO may be a domestic consultant with appropriate expertise and experience in implementing resettlement.  \n   ", "22   \nimprovements  leading  to  increased  road  accidents  will  be  addressed  by  the  road  safety \ncomponent.   \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n91.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and state governments of CG \nand MP have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n1.  General \n92.

The Government will cause the governments of CG and MP to provide, as necessary, \ncounterpart staff, land facilities, and counterpart funding for the Project in accordance with the \nfinancing plan\u2014cost of land acquisition and compensation, and implementation and monitoring \nunder  the  LAPs  and  IPDPs  (including  unforeseen  expenses  beyond  the  estimates),  utility \nrelocation, general project management expenses, and road maintenance\u2014in a timely manner \nthrough approved annual budget allocations. \n \n2.  Road Maintenance \n95.  All maintenance works, including routine and renewal, for completed PMGSY roads in CG \nand MP will be outsourced to private contractors. \n \n96.  The governments of CG and MP will employ contractors under the construction contracts \nto carry out maintenance of all PMGSY and Project roads during the first 5 years (the initial 5-\nyear maintenance period). \n \n97.  The governments of CG and MP will provide adequate funding for proper maintenance of \nthe PMGSY roads, in accordance with the estimates provided to MORD in their respective \ncommitment letters in this regard. Any increases in the actual amounts to be provided will be met \nby the governments of CG and MP through additional budget allocations, or other alternative \nsources of financing such as Mandi Cess in the case of MP. \n \n98.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the financing of maintenance of PMGSY \nroads as provided under para. 97 will not involve reduction of budgets for maintaining other roads \nunder the responsibility of CG and MP that are not included under the PMGSY.  \n \n99.  As also required under the PMGSY guidelines, except as ADB may otherwise agree, CG \nand MP will require the IAs (through the PIUs) to transfer maintenance of the PMGSY roads to \ndesignated zilla panchayats before the end of the initial 5-year maintenance period for each such \nroad. The governments of CG and MP will also allocate the requisite funds to zilla panchayats for  \nsuch maintenance in accordance with para. 97.  \n \n   ", " 23 \n100.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that zilla panchayats enter into further \nmaintenance contracts with competitively procured contractors (on the basis of the standard \nperformance-based contracts for road maintenance to be prepared by PMC). The contracts will \nbegin upon completion of the initial 5-year maintenance period  under the related construction \ncontracts and will cover routine maintenance and renewal of all PMGSY roads for further periods \nof not less than 5 years. \n \n101.  Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the governments of CG and MP will introduce a \nsimple planning, costing, and expenditure control system for routine and periodic maintenance of \nPMGSY roads by the designated zilla panchayats. \n \n102.  Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, MORD will have progressed in its dialogue with \nthe states participating in PMGSY with regard to making adequate plans, financing arrangements, \nand commitments to properly maintain the PMGSY network over its useful economic life.  \n \n3.  Road Safety \n103.  As part of the MTR, MORD, the governments of CG and MP, and ADB will review the \noutcomes  of  the  startup  phase  of  the  community  road  safety  program  to  consolidate  the \ninstitutional mechanism, financing modalities, and detailed implementing arrangements to ensure \nsustainable road safety programs for the roads to be developed under PMGSY and the Project at \nthe national and state levels. \n \n4.  Land Acquisition  \n104.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the IAs will implement the provisions of \nthe LAP for sample subprojects as agreed upon with ADB and in accordance with the framework \nset out in the LAP and in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. During implementation, the IAs will prepare and implement LAPs for \nadditional subprojects in accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the LAF, to be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before awarding civil works contracts. If changes to an agreed LAP \nare required, the IA will seek ADB approval for such changes before awarding any civil works \ncontracts for subprojects included in the LAP. \n \n105.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the IAs will not award any civil works \ncontract unless they have, subject to provisions of paragraphs 106-107 and 116-118, acquired or \nmade available the land and rights to land free from any encumbrances, and cleared the utilities, \ntrees and any other obstruction from such land, required for commencement of construction \nactivities in accordance with the schedule agreed under the related civil works contract. \n \n106.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the settlement of issues, as applicable, \nrelating to land acquisition and resettlement compensation payments will include (i) payments of \nfull compensation/replacement land or value of land/structure (residential/commercial) to legal \ntitleholders; (ii) payment of full replacement value of structure (residential/commercial) to affected \ninformal settlers/roadside squatters; and (iii) payment of other additional benefits and provision of \nassistance in accordance with the LAP provisions, including income restoration assistance during \nproject implementation and additional assistance to vulnerable groups such as STs, SCs, and \nhouseholds headed by women. \n \n107.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that IAs will disclose approved LAPs for \nadditional subprojects and make available the information to the affected people and communities \n   ", "24   \nbefore awarding civil work contracts, and confirm that summary LAPs will be posted on the ADB \nweb site.  \n \n108.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that the IAs will recruit PICs with expertise in \nsocial development, land acquisition, and resettlement to help prepare, implement, and supervise \nLAPs for all subprojects.  \n \n5.  Execution of Civil Works Contracts \n109.  The governments of CG and MP will (i) acquire or make available on a timely basis the \nland and rights in land, free from any encumbrances; and (ii) clear the utilities, trees and any \nother obstruction from such land, on a timely basis, i.e., strictly in accordance with the schedule \nas agreed under the related civil works contract, as required for construction activities relating to \neach section of the related civil works contract under the subproject. \n \n110.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that subsequent to award of civil works \ncontract under any subproject, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will be \nhanded  over  to  the  contractor  unless  the  provisions  for  settlement  of  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation, disclosure and environmental safeguards (paras. 106, 107 and 116-118) have \nbeen complied with. \n \n6.  Social Impacts \n111.  Wherever applicable, the subprojects will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous people, as amended from time to time, and the IPDF.   \n \n112.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the governments of CG and MP, through the IAs, \nwill recruit NGOs to independently monitor and verify the implementation of LAPs and IPDPs, and \nany voluntary contributions of land under the Project.  \n \n113.  The  governments  of  CG  and  MP  will  ensure  through  specific  provisions  in  the  bid \ndocuments and the civil works contracts financed under the Project that the contractors will (i) \ndisseminate information at work sites on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS \nas part of the health and safety measures for those employed during construction; (ii) follow \nlegally mandated provisions on health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions, including \naccommodation, where appropriate, for construction workers at camp sites; (iii) comply with all \napplicable labor laws, not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, and \nprovide appropriate facilities for children of labor in construction camp sites; (iv) provide equal \nopportunity for women for road construction activities, and not differentiate wages for men and \nwomen for work of equal value.   \n \n114.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure that compliance with provisions in para. 113 \nis monitored by the IAs. The civil works contracts will also provide for their termination by the \nemployer for breach of any provision. \n \n115.  The governments of CG and MP will ensure acceptance of the Project through effective \ncommunity  participation  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the \nPMGSY guidelines. \n \n   ", " 25 \n7.  Environment  \n116.  The governments of CP and MP will ensure that (i) subprojects will be implemented in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  as  set  forth  in  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), as amended from time to time, and (ii) all environmental mitigation measures \nidentified in the IEEs for all subprojects are incorporated into the subproject designs and followed \nduring project construction, operation and maintenance.  \n \n117.

Introduction \n1.  India\u2019s transport system is one of the largest in the world. It serves a land area of 3.3 \nmillion square kilometers (km) and consists of roads, railways, and air services. Inland water \ntransport plays a small role in some states and has a total traffic share of 0.15%. In the past, \nrailways were the predominant transport mode. In 1960 railways carried 85% of goods traffic (in \nton km) and 51% of passenger traffic (in passenger km). By 2001, the figures had declined to \n32% of goods and 13% of passenger traffic. Road transport is now the dominant mode and \naccounts for 68% of goods traffic (in ton km) and 87% of passenger traffic (in passenger km).  \n \nB.  Roads Subsector, Government Strategy, and Road Sector Institutions  \n1.  The Roads Subsector and the Importance of Rural Roads \n2.  The road network can be subdivided into three main categories: (i) national highways, (ii) \nstate highways and major district roads (MDRs), and (iii) rural roads. In the country as a whole, \nnational highways account for about 58,112 km or 2%; state highways and MDRs for around \n607,119 km or 18%; and rural roads for about 2,650,000 km or 88% of the total road network. \nAlthough national highways comprise only 2% of the road network, they carry about 40% of the \ntotal road traffic. The state highways and MDRs provide linkages with the national highways, \ndistrict  headquarters,  important  towns,  tourist  centers,  and  minor  ports.  The  MDRs  within \ndistricts connect areas of production with markets, rural areas to district headquarters, and to \nstate and national highways. \n \n3.  The road network is inadequate at the national, state, and district levels. It is unable to \nhandle high traffic density at many places and has poor riding quality. Widespread overloading \nof freight vehicles damages the road pavement. Use of the road pavement by both motorized \nand nonmotorized vehicles (bicycles, animal-drawn vehicles, etc.) causes congestion and high \nlevels of traffic accidents. In rural areas, roads become impassable during the rainy season due \nto missing bridges, and inadequate, defective, or missing drainage culverts. One main reason \nfor the poor state of the road network is  lack of adequate funding for  maintenance and for \nimproving the quality of the network.   \n \n4.  Improving the road transport network  is important for  the economic development and \nsocial integration of the country. Over 70% of India\u2019s population live in rural areas. Providing \nrural areas with all-weather roads is a key component of rural development and economic \ngrowth, and will significantly improve the quality of life of the majority of the people. Roads have \nconsiderable  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  for  they  lead  to  higher  agricultural  incomes, \nincreased productive employment opportunities, and improved access to economic and social \nservices.1 \n \n2.  Government Strategy  \n5.  The main objective of the road sector in the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan (2002-2007) is the \nbalanced development of the total road network, which includes widening roads, improving  \nriding quality, strengthening road safety measures, and  establishing wayside amenities.  Two \nmajor investment initiatives will be implemented. The first is the National Highway Development \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2002. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction: A Case Study-Based Analysis.  ", "      Appendix 1  27\nProject comprising the 5,846 km golden quadrilateral linking  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai, and \nKolkata; and the 7,300 km north-south, east-west corridors from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and \nSilchar to Porbandar. This project, which is being  being implemented by National Highway \nAuthority of India,2 envisages creating four/six-lanes on the existing network at a cost of Rs540 \nbillion ($11 billion). Financing comes from earmarked cess on petrol and diesel, multilateral \nfunding,  budgetary  allocations,  and  market  borrowing.  The  second  major  initiative  is  the \nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)3 which has the overall objective of connecting \nrural habitations with populations of 500 or more to all-weather roads by 2007. The estimated \ncost is around Rs600 billion ($12 billion). Financing is being provided from earmarked cess, \nmultilateral funding, and budgetary allocations.  \n \nC.  Rural Roads Subsector Profile \n1.  Rural Roads Network and Traffic \n6.  The rural road network consists of zilla panchayat roads, gram panchayat roads, and \ncommunity  roads.  There  are  five  major  surface  types:  (i)  track,  (ii)  earth,  (iii)  gravel,  (iv) \nwaterbound macadam, and (v) blacktop. Neither track  nor earth roads are passable in all-\nweather conditions. Gravel and waterbound macadam roads often become impassable during \nheavy rains. The majority of the network of rural roads is under-developed, of low standard and \npoor quality, structurally weak, poorly maintained, and extremely deteriorated.   \n \n7.  Madhya Pradesh (MP) has a total road network of 202,240 km, of which 57,205 km is \nsurfaced. There are 4,717 km of national highways, 7,923 km of state highways, 30,070 km of \ndistrict roads, and 159,530 km of rural roads. Around 80% of all roads in MP are single lane \n(3.75 m carriageway), 14% intermediate lane (5.5 m) and only 2% are 2-lane (7 m) or more. \nApproximately 37% of roads are blacktop; 42%, waterbound macadam; and 21%  have no \nsurface treatment. The Public Works Department of the Government of MP is responsible for \n25,033 km, while the remaining 134,497 km  of roads are the responsibility of  the Madhya \nPradesh Rural Development Department, and the panchayats.  \n \n8.  Chhattisgarh (CG) has about 50,000 km of roads, of which national highways make up \n1,827 km; state highways,  3,611 km; MDRs, 2,118 km; other district roads, 27,526 km; and \ntracks, about 15,000 km. Excluding tracks, only 30% of the total road network has a bituminous \nsurface.  Of  the  total  road  network  35,000  km  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment. The remainder falls under the responsibility of the Chhattisgarh Department of \nPanchayat and Rural Development, and the panchayats.  \n \n9.  Rural roads are essentially low-volume roads with wide variations in traffic volume and \ncomposition. Traffic is motorized and nonmotorized (bicycles, animal-drawn vehicles, etc.). \nTraffic counts in 2002 in MP showed motorized traffic volumes averaging 51 vehicles per day \nand non-motorized traffic averaging 69 vehicles per day. The average traffic compositions for \nmotorized traffic showed between 37% and 45% motorcycles, 20% cars, and 10% trucks. The \nremaining traffic was composed mainly of tractors. Of the nonmotorized traffic, approximately \n83% were bicycles and the remainder were animal-drawn vehicles. Similar traffic counts in 2002 \nin CG showed motorized traffic between 35 and 80 vehicles per day.   \n \n                                                 \n2  In addition, the National Highways Authority of India is also creating four lanes on another 1,000 km of highways, \n400 km roads connected to ports and 600 km for other projects, at a cost of Rs40 billion. \n3  Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program. ", "28   Appendix 1 \n2.  Vehicle Fleet and Transport Services \n10.  The  vehicle  fleet  in  India  totaled  around  50  million  vehicles  in  1999-2000.  Buses \naccounted for 1%; trucks, 5%; cars and jeeps, 13%; and motorcycles and scooters, 71%. The \nremainder was mostly auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. The number of \nautomobiles has been growing at approximately 9% a year, and heavy commercial vehicles, at \n7.5% over the last 9 years. \n \n11.  In  MP,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Transport  Department  is  responsible  for  licensing, \nregistering and regulating motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and freight transport. In 2001 \nover 2.9 million motor vehicles were registered: 74% motorcycles, 5% cars and jeeps, 3% \ncommercial trucks, 2% buses and minibuses, 2% two- and three-wheeler public transport \nvehicles, 9% tractors, and 5% others. Between 1990 and 1998 the registered vehicles increased \nat an average rate of 10.7% per annum. \n \n12.  In CG, the Transport Department is responsible for motor vehicle regulation and driver \nlicensing. It has eight  regional transport offices. In 2001-2002, 978,000 motor vehicles were \nregistered:  80% motorcycles, 4% cars and jeeps, 14% commercial vehicles, and 2% buses, \nmini-buses, and other passenger vehicles.  \n \n13.  Both freight and passenger services are operated by private operators and state road \ntransport  undertakings  (SRTUs).4  Freight  services  are  predominantly  owned  by  individual \nprivate operators with  1-3 trucks per operator.  Private truck operators are estimated to be \nhandling over 80% of total freight traffic. The SRTUs handle less than 20% of the total traffic \nwith a truck strength that was estimated at around 671 trucks at the end of the Annual Plan for \n2000-2001. Similarly, passenger transport services are supplied  by both SRTUs and private \noperators. However, following liberalization, the share of SRTUs operating passenger transport \nservices has declined. The share of the private sector in the total number of buses has \nincreased from 57% in 1980/81 to 77% in 1997. Taking into account the traffic carried by other \ncommercial and personal vehicles, the share of the private sector in total passenger traffic is \nestimated at about 90%.  \n \n14.  Passenger fares for public transport and freight rates in rural areas are competitive.5 \nThey  are  determined  through  market  competition  and  are  not  regulated.  The  majority  of \noperators of passenger services and freight transport on rural roads provide services as an \nextension of their other economic activities, to supplement their incomes. For example, many \nfreight operators  are farmers with their own tractor or pickup truck who offer services for \ntransporting agricultural produce to market. As the incomes of rural farmers are low, there is a \nhigh degree of competitiveness in freight rates to obtain additional income from this source of \nemployment. In the rural passenger transport market, many individual operators owning jeeps, \npickups and other vehicle types compete in taking passengers to local markets and other \nfacilities. Most rural passenger transport operators are farmers who offer passenger services as \na side-line. Therefore, services are often erratic and usually have no fixed schedule.       \n \n                                                 \n4  There are 62 SRTUs throughout India. \n5  In contrast, for state roads there are factors limiting the competitiveness of passenger transport and freight \ntransport. For example  on state roads in Chhattisgarh passenger fares are set by the Chhattisgarh Transport \nDepartment. The fare schedules are set by vehicle class for buses, taxis, and minibuses. Freight rates on state \nroads are fairly competitive, but there are isolated areas where rates are not competitive, and have been set by the \nShippers Association. ", "      Appendix 1  29\n3.  Road Maintenance and Funding \n15.  The major part of the rural road network is in extremely poor condition. Rural roads that \nare paved are often worn out only a few years after paving. Even basic maintenance practices \nare  lacking.  For  rural  roads,  systematic  planning,  execution,  and  financing  schemes  for \nmaintenance are almost nonexistent.  \n \n16.  Following the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, maintenance of rural roads is to become \nthe responsibility of the panchayat institutions. Maintenance responsibilities for all rural roads \nthat have been constructed or upgraded are to be transferred to the concerned panchayats. The \nstate authorities  are to  remit state government funds to the identified panchayats for the \nrequisite maintenance.  \n \n17.  In November 2000 Parliament passed the Central Road Fund Act whereby the Central \nRoad Fund will allocate to development of rural roads 50%  (approximately Rs25 billion per \nannum)  of  the  excise  duties  (cess)  raised  on  high-speed  diesel.  The  fund  is  dedicated \nexclusively  to  road  development.  State governments  and  panchayats are responsible for \nfinancing  maintenance.6  The  PMGSY  guidelines  require  states  to  commit  to  providing \nmaintenance funds as a condition for continued funding of construction under PMGSY.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6 The 2003/04 budget has increased the levy of diesel cess by a further Rs0.50 per liter, of which 50% or an \nestimated Rs10 billion per annum will be assigned to PMGSY.

The roads to be constructed or upgraded under the Project are rural roads comprising  \nvillage roads and other district roads to provide all-weather connectivity to habitations. The \nproject roads will be built along the alignments of the existing earth/gravel roads that are in poor \ncondition. The majority of these roads are impassable for 3-4 months during the wet season. As \nthey presently carry a low volume of traffic\u2014on average less than 50 motorized vehicles per \nday\u2014and projected traffic for them after 20 years will still be below 1,000, the project roads are  \nclassified as low-traffic roads. \n \nA.  Design Standards for Project Roads \n \n2.    The design criteria adopted are in accordance with the Indian Roads Congress  (IRC) \npublication Rural Roads Manual (IRC:SP:20-2002) and other IRC design codes that have been \nfollowed by the Prime Minister\u2019s Rural Roads Program (PMGSY). The standards are consistent \nwith standard international practices adopted by the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials design standards and Transport Research Laboratory Overseas Road \nNote 31: Guide to the Structural Design of Bitumen-Surfaced Roads in Tropical and Subtropical \nCountries, and are found appropriate. \n \n3.  PMGSY only requires that roads should be negotiable in all kinds of weather. The choice \nof surfacing takes into account factors such as traffic, soil type, and rainfall. Under the Project, \nthe subprojects must meet an economic internal  rate of return threshold to ensure they are \neconomically justified. In many cases, bitumen surfacing will be the most economic option, \nparticularly because (i) the unit construction cost of $40,000-45,000 per kilometer is low; (ii) \nunder monsoon conditions there are risks that gravel-surfaced roads will be washed away by \nrains; and (iii) gravel roads require frequent maintenance if they are to realize their potential life, \nbut there are uncertainties about establishing a permanent capacity sufficient for carrying out \nrequired activities. \n \nB.  General Design Consideration \n \n4.  The major improvements on the project roads follow: \n \n(i)  widen the existing roadway to 7.5 meters (m)\u2014efforts will be made to confine \nwidening within the existing right-of-way to minimize adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts; \n \n(ii)  provide 3.75 m wide carriageway with granular subbase, waterbound macadam \nas base, overlaid with bitumen; \n \n(iii)  provide 3.75 m shoulder (1.875 m on each side); \n \n(iv)  raise the embankment to provide a minimum subgrade level of  0.5 m above \nnatural  ground  level  or  0.6  m  above  highest  flood  level  to  meet  hydraulic \nrequirements; \n \n(v)  improve horizontal and vertical alignment to allow a design speed of 50 km/h on \nlevel terrain; the existing alignment will be followed in most cases to minimize \nresettlement; \n  ", "40   Appendix 6 \n(vi)  provide adequate road safety features through a safety audit; \n \n(vii)  provide  proper  cross-drainage  structures,  where  necessary,  to  ensure  all-\nweather connectivity; conduits for future irrigation pipes will be provided;   \n \n(viii)  provide road furniture including signs, kilometer posts, etc.; and \n  \n(ix)  establish tree plantations along the roads where appropriate.  \n \nC.  Estimated Cost of Sample Subprojects \n \n5.  The project roads are rural roads designed to meet a very low level of traffic volume and \nminimum all-weather connectivity. The unit cost of existing PMGSY roads is generally low\u2014in \nthe vicinity of $30,000 per km for projects cleared for implementation in 2000-2003 in Madhya \nPradesh and Chhattisgarh. The roads are mostly new construction requiring earthwork.  \n \n6.  As improved design criteria will be adopted for the subproject, civil works cost under \nADB funding is expected to increase. The estimated unit cost per km of the sample subprojects \n(approximately 500 km in each state) is $44,200 in Chhattisgarh and $41,400 in Madhya \nPradesh (see Table). The increase in costs is mainly due to increase in cross-drainage works \nand the quantity of earthwork to meet the requirements of the improved design criteria.  \n \nEstimated Unit Costs per km of Sample Subprojects  \n($) \n \nItem  Chhattisgarh  Madhya Pradesh  \n \nRoad (earthwork, pavement)  36,200  35,500 \nCross-drainage works      8,000    5,900 \nTotal Cost  44,200  41,400 \n ", "      Appendix 7   41\nSELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUBPROJECTS \nA.  Subproject Selection \n1.  Selection of road connectivity subprojects by the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) \nwill  be  subject  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approval.  The  criteria  for  selecting  \nsubprojects follow: \n \n(i)  Subprojects will cover rural roads that lack an all-weather road connection. \n(ii)  Subprojects will be eligible for construction or upgrading in accordance with the \nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) guidelines, and be included in the \nrespective district core network. \n(iii)  Identification of priority link roads will be based on a ranking using criteria defined \nin  the  PMGSY  guidelines:  (a)  provide  new  connectivity  to  unconnected \nhabitations with a population greater than 1,000 (500 in the case of scheduled \nareas as given in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India); and (b) provide \nnew connectivity to unconnected habitations with a population greater than 500 \n(250 in the case of scheduled areas as given in Fifth Schedule to the Constitution \nof India). \n(iv)  Subprojects will be ranked using an area approach, selecting packages of roads \nthat contain (a) the link road that connects the highest priority habitation; (b) the \nthrough road that serves the link road; and (c) other eligible link roads that \nconnect to the through route. \n(v)  Subprojects will be technically feasible, and a detailed project report will be \nprepared. \n(vi)  Road safety audit of the subproject will have been conducted and necessary \nroad safety mitigation measures incorporated in the subproject designs. \n(vii)  For each selected package of road subprojects [see (iv)], economic analysis will \nbe prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects as amended from time to time and the estimated economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of the package will be at least 10-12%, except that each state \nmay  assign  up  to  15%  of  annual  project  road  construction  expenditure  to \npackages  in  very  poor  and  remote  areas  on  the  basis  of  a  weighting  of \nsocioeconomic  indicators  of  economic  potential,  incidence  of  poverty,  and \ndifficulty of access, as acceptable to ADB. \n(viii)  Subprojects will be socially sound, and minimize the need for land acquisition, \nand include measures to mitigate any social impacts they will cause. \n(ix)  An initial social assessment (ISA) for the subproject will have been prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis, as amended \nfrom time to time. \n(x)  If  a  subproject  involves  any  land  acquisition,  it  will  be  included  in  a  land \nacquisition plan (LAP) to be prepared following the measures set forth in the land \nacquisition  framework  (LAF)  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement, 1995, as amended from time to time, and submitted to \nADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are awarded. \n(xi)  If any indigenous peoples/scheduled tribes are likely to be significantly affected \nby a subproject, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan (IPDP) following the \nmeasures set forth in the IPDP framework will be prepared in accordance with ", "42   Appendix 7 \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 1998, as amended from time to time, and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  civil  works  contracts  are \nawarded. \n(xii)  Subprojects will be environmentally sound, and none will be located within  an \nenvironmentally sensitive area, such as a wildlife sanctuary, national parks, or \nother area having significant ecological functions. \n(xiii)  An initial environmental examination (IEE) report will have been prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  2003,  as \namended from time to time. \n(xiv)  Sufficient government counterpart funding will be allocated by the Government or \nstate governments, as required to implement the subproject as scheduled. \n(xv)  All necessary central and state government approvals will have been obtained. \n \nB.  Approval Process for Subprojects \n2.  All subprojects must comply with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, and satisfy ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  subproject  preparation,  including  the  technical,  operational,  environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement dimensions. In respect of the sample subprojects, these requirements \nwere met during project preparation. For additional subprojects the requirement will be met \nduring project implementation.  \n \n3.  Two  months  before  starting  procurement  action  for  the  additional  subprojects  for \ninclusion in the second, third, and fourth annual batches, the implementing agencies (IAs) \nthrough MORD will submit to ADB for approval a report providing details of the compliance of \neach proposed subproject in the batch with the selection criteria (para. 1). The approval process \nfor each batch of additional subprojects will be as follows: \n \n(i)  With the assistance of project implementation consultants (PICs), the IA prepares \na consolidated report indicating the compliance of each proposed subproject with \nthe selection criteria, including an overall IEE for all subprojects, which will focus \non any environmental problems identified and mitigation required, and including \nan ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP for each area.1  \n(ii)  With the assistance of the project management consultant (PMC), the National \nRural  Roads  Development  Agency  (NRRDA)  of  MORD  as  per  PMGSY \nGuidelines,  screens  the  report,  arranges  for  any  refinements  to  meet  ADB \nrequirements,  and  prepares  a  summary  checklist  summarizing  the  eligibility, \npreparation status, and safeguard compliance of each subproject. \n(iii)  Subject to addressing any modification as required under clause (iv) above, the \nIA submits the report and checklist through MORD to ADB for approval. \n(iv)  The ADB approves the proposed subprojects, subject to any further modifications \nrequired. \n(v)  Subject to addressing any modification as required under clause (iv) above, the \nIA proceeds with procurement for the subprojects approved by ADB. \n \n                                                 \n1 Each PIC will be responsible for providing the IA with a report covering the districts under its responsibility, including \nan IEE, ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP. The IA will then prepare a consolidated report for all subprojects in the \nstate, including a consolidated IEE, ISA, LAP, and, if necessary, IPDP.

Introduction \n1.  The Project involves improving about 11,000 kilometers (km) of village and other district \nroads, of which about 5,500 km will be in Chhattisgarh (CG) and 5,500 km in Madhya Pradesh \n(MP). Under the Project, road subprojects, which will typically be about 3-8 km long, will be \nselected and implemented in clusters of adjacent roads within districts. Due to the sector \nlending approach, a sample of about 1,000 km was selected for detailed preparation before \nBoard consideration, with the remaining 10,000 km to be similarly prepared during project \nimplementation. The economic analysis examined 794 km of sample subprojects comprising \n375 km in CG and 419 km in MP, equivalent to about 7% of the total roads to be built under the \nProject.  \n \n2.  In the economic evaluation, the without-project case represents the current situation \nwhereby villages are served by rudimentary earth roads.  The with-project case represents \nimprovement to all-weather standard. Road improvement will reduce operating costs, leading to \nincreased economic activity and growth in traffic. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \ncompared the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs and benefits. All costs, \nbenefits, and revenues were expressed in 2003 constant prices. The analysis period is for the \nconstruction  period  followed  by  20  years  of  operation.  The  detailed  assumptions  for  the \neconomic analysis and distribution analysis are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n1.  Traffic Volumes and Traffic Forecasts \n \n3.  Classified traffic counts for the project roads in 2002 were obtained from the two state \ngovernments. Field surveys and traffic surveys were carried out in 2003 to verify the traffic \ncount, and convert them to an annual average daily traffic (ADT) basis. The traffic counts were \nseparated  into  motorized  traffic  (cars/utility,  buses,  trucks,  tractors,  and  motorcycles)  and \nnonmotorized traffic (bicycles and animal-drawn vehicles). Traffic volumes on most subproject \nroads averaged around 100 vehicles per day, of which about 40-50% were motorized and 50-\n60% nonmotorized.  \n \n4.  Different traffic categories were distinguished for forecasting purposes: (i) normal traffic, \n(ii) generated traffic, and (iii) induced traffic. Normal traffic is traffic that would use the sample \nsubproject roads irrespective of whether they are improved. Generated traffic is traffic that did \nnot use the road before improvement but will be attracted after improvement due to the \nreduction in travel cost or in travel time. Induced traffic is additional traffic caused by growth in \nlocal economic development as a result of road improvement.  \n \n5.  For normal traffic, the forecast growth rates for freight traffic were based on analysis of \ngross domestic product and the income elasticity of transport demand. Forecast growth of \npassenger traffic was based on the population growth rate, per capita income growth, and the \nincome elasticity of transport demand. The adopted traffic growth rates varied between 4% and \n9% per annum depending on vehicle type. Based on the average vehicle composition for the \ntotal sample of subproject roads, the forecast overall growth rate was approximately 7% for \n2003-2010 and 6.3% beyond 2010.  ", "  Appendix 11        47\n      \n6.  Generated and induced traffic were considered for motorized vehicles only. Both traffic \ntypes will be attracted to the improved subproject roads. Generated traffic was estimated using \nthe price elasticity of demand.1 In the first year after improvement, generated traffic was \nestimated at 30-60% of normal traffic, depending on vehicle type and the respective price \nelasticity of demand. To assess the induced traffic potential of the subproject roads, traffic \nsurveys were conducted for 30 similar rural road improvements in CG and MP that had been \ncompleted and has been opened to traffic for 1-2 years. The actual traffic in the opening years \nwas  compared  with  what  would  be  expected  on  the  basis  of  the  original  traffic  before \nimprovement, normal traffic growth, and estimated generated traffic. Sudden jumps in traffic \nvolumes were observed, to the extent that actual traffic was often more than 150% greater than \nforecast normal traffic. A conservative estimate for induced traffic assumed that that this would \neventually equal 100% of base year traffic, but would be phased in over the first 5 years \noperations, since changes in economic development in the areas served by subproject roads \nwill be gradual. \n \n2.  Costs \n7.  The economic costs of the subprojects were derived from the financial costs. They \ninclude construction and maintenance costs, and exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand interest during construction. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to financial \ncosts of nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) of \n0.7 was used to obtain the economic costs of unskilled labor. The subprojects were expected to \nhave an average economic life of 20 years.  \n \n3.  Benefits \n8.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  were  quantified  in  terms  of  (i) vehicle \noperating cost savings arising from the improved road surface, (ii) time savings due to reduced \njourney time on improved roads, and (iii) savings in the marketable surplus of agricultural \nproducts due to reduction in spoilage of goods traveling along the project roads.   \n \n9.  Benefits for normal, generated, and induced traffic were estimated using the Roads \nEconomic Decision model for economic evaluation of low-volume roads. The model predicts \npavement  deterioration  and  estimates  yearly  vehicle  operating  costs  over  the  life  of  the \ninvestment. The model also calculates the time savings attributable to each vehicle type. The \nbenefits to generated and induced traffic were calculated by assuming that the demand curve is \nlinear with respect to cost, and the benefit per unit of traffic is half that of normal traffic.  \n \n4.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n10.  The economic evaluation discounted the stream of costs and benefits over 2004-2024, \nvalued in 2003 prices. The EIRR was calculated for each district cluster of sample subprojects, \nbased on estimates for individual sample subprojects, and for the sample subprojects as a \nwhole.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n11.  The sensitivity of the EIRR for the total sample subprojects was analyzed with respect to \nchanges in the benefit and cost streams. The sensitivity tests covered (i) a construction cost \nincrease of 20%, (ii) benefits reduced by 20%, (iii) a reduction in traffic growth rates by 50%, (iv) \nexclusion of generated traffic benefits, (v) exclusion of time savings benefits, (vi) combination of \na 20% increase in capital costs and 20% reduction of benefits, and (vii) a 20% reduction of \nbenefits and exclusion of generated traffic and time savings benefits.  \n \n12.  Table A11.2 below summarizes the EIRR for the base case and the sensitivity tests. The \nbase case EIRR for the sample subprojects as a whole was 26.6%. The EIRR remains above \nthe opportunity cost of capital of 12% in each of the sensitivity tests. Sensitivity tests for the \ndistrict  clusters  of  subprojects  and  for  selected  individual  subprojects  are  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. The results indicate that the EIRRs for clusters of subprojects and \nfor individual subprojects are robust under adverse scenarios.  \n ", "  Appendix 11        49\n      \nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Test for Total Sample of Subproject Roads \n \nScenario  EIRR (%) \n   \nBase Case  26.6 \n   \nSensitivity Tests   \n(i)   Capital Cost 20% Higher  22.7 \n(ii)   Benefits 20% Lower  21.4 \n(iii)   Traffic Growth 50% Lower  22.8 \n(iv)   No Generated Traffic Benefits  22.7 \n(v)   No Time Savings Benefits  25.6 \n(vi)   Capital Cost 20% Higher, Benefits 20% Lower  18.1 \n(vii)  Benefits 20% Lower, No Time or Generated Benefits  17.0 \n   EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n   Source: TA No. 3914-IND, Rural Road Sector Development Project; ADB staff estimates. \n \n13.  Risk  analysis  was  also  undertaken  for  the  total  sample  of  subproject  roads.  The \neconomic  analysis  model  performed  the  risk  analysis  based  on  triangular  probability \ndistributions for the main input parameters. This enables analysis to be made based on the \nuncertainty present in the estimates of the input parameters to generate results that show all \npossible outcomes. Risk analysis was undertaken for the total sample of subproject roads2 by \nrunning a simulation in which possible values of the variables were randomly sampled 1,000 \ntimes using a Monte Carlo nonstratified technique. The results are summarized in Table A11.3. \nUnder the tests conducted there is only a 3.8% probability that the EIRR will fall below 12%. \n \nTable A11.3: Risk Analysis for Total Sample of Subprojects \nScenario  (%) \nBase EIRR  26.6 \nProbability of EIRR less than 12%  3.8 \nMinimum EIRR estimate  5.1 \nMaximum EIRR estimate  64.6 \nMedian EIRR estimate  25.1 \n \nC.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n14.  Distribution analysis was used to disaggregate the estimated economic benefits among \npassenger  and  freight  users,  vehicle  owners/operators,  labor,3  and  the  government.  The \nassessment  of  the  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  examined  how  much  each  of  the  different \nstakeholders would benefit from the project, and what proportion for each group of stakeholders \nis poor. The starting point was to estimate the share of benefits accruing to each category of \nvehicles,  including  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  as  well  as  nonmotorized  traffic.  It  was \nnecessary to identify not only the beneficiaries (owners/operators, road users, etc.) but also the \nproportion of each beneficiary category that is poor. It was also necessary to estimate (i) how \n                                                 \n2  Additionally, individual road subprojects were also analyzed and results are detailed in Supplementary Appendix I. \n3  As some of subproject capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled laborers \nwill gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor (reflected in \nthe SWRF).  ", "50   Appendix 11 \nmuch of the benefits for each vehicle category in the analysis will be passed on to the user of \nthe vehicle, and (ii) the ownership of each vehicle category. For this purpose, field surveys were \nundertaken of passengers, drivers, and farmers in sample subproject districts in CG and MP. \nFrom these surveys a series of assumptions were developed regarding benefits that will be \npassed on to users of transport services. Distribution analysis was used to estimate a poverty \nimpact ratio (PIR) based on assumptions of how much of the benefits to each class of user will \nbe passed on to the poor. The assumptions were made from the information collected in field \nsurveys and other relevant data. The assumptions are described in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n15.  Table A11.4 shows the distribution of benefits for the total sample of subproject roads in \npresent value terms, using a discount rate of 12%, and the calculation of the PIR. The estimated \nPIR was 1.32, indicating that the total net economic benefits reaching the poor will exceed the \noverall total net economic benefits.4 This indicates that the Project is highly pro-poor. \n \nTable A11.4: Distribution of Net Benefits (Rs million) and Estimation of  \nPoverty Impact Ratio \nFinancial  Economic  Economic \nPresent  Present  Less  Passenger  Freight  Vehicle  Govt/   \nItem  Value  Value  Financial  Users  Users  Owners  Labor  Economy  Net \n                   \nBenefits                   \nRoad User  0  3,822.14  3,822.14  1,063.37  376.52  2,292.19    90.06   \nBenefits \n                   \nCost                   \nCapital Cost  (1,694.40)  (1,491.88)  202.52          202.52   \nO&M  (322.98)  (280.99)  41.99          41.99   \nLabor  (103.60)  (72.51)  31.09        31.09     \n                   \nNet Present  (2,120.98)  1,976.76  4,097.74  1,063.37  376.52  2,292.19  31.09  334.57   \nValue \n  Gains and Losses  1,063.37  376.52  2,292.19  31.09  (1,786.41)  1,976.76 \n  Proportion of the Poor (%)  80  50  75  80  10   \n  Net Benefits for the Poor  850.69  186.26  1,719.14  24.87  (178.64)  2,604.33 \n           \n        Poverty Impact Ratio  1.32 \nNote: The net loss to the government/economy of negative 1,786.41 is calculated as the sum of negative 2,120.98 and +334.57.  \nSource: TA 3914-IND, Rural Road Sector Development Project; ADB staff estimates. \n \n16.  A sensitivity analysis of the PIR was prepared to test the impact of changes in key \nassumptions. The sensitivity tests were (i) a 50% increase in competition, and (ii) a 50% \ndecrease in competition. The results are in Table A11.5.

Linkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as national priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in the \ncountry poverty analysis              Yes  Country partnership agreement    Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the states of Madhya Pradesh (MP) \nand Chhattisgarh (CG), India: \n \nThe proposed Rural Roads Sector I Project aims to reduce poverty by encouraging human \ndevelopment and economic growth through the provision of  5,500 kilometers (km) of all-\nweather road connectivity in MP and 5,500 km in CG, which will directly benefit 5.2 million rural \nvillagers  in  MP  and  CG.  The  Project  is  part  of  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana \n(PMGSY),  a  national  program  also  known  as  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Rural  Roads  Project. \nPMGSY, which began in 2001, aims to reduce poverty in rural areas by providing all-weather \nconnectivity to habitations with a population of 1,000 or more by 2003, and to habitations with \n500 or more by 2007. A special provision is to include settlements with populations over 250 \npeople in hilly, desert, and tribal areas. The roads range from 1 to 22 km and will link \npreviously isolated villages to provincial, state, and national road networks.   \n \nProject areas are currently isolated for up to 4 months during monsoon season. The situation \ncontributes to poverty by reducing access to social services\u2014notably health and education\u2014\nveterinary and agricultural support services, markets, and various affirmative action programs \nfor  disadvantaged  groups.  Where  all-weather  connectivity  is  provided,  all  socioeconomic \ngroups benefit. Studies comparing completed PMGSY roads with unimproved roads (control \nsample) provide indications of the benefits the Project will bring to the rural population in the \nproject area.  \n \nAgricultural diversification has rapidly followed the provision of all-weather roads to district \nmarkets, potentially increasing the incomes of farmers in all income groups. Milk and vegetable \nproduction can potentially increase annual incomes of marginal farmers by Rs4,000-8,000 a \nyear, of small farmers by Rs20,000 or more, and of farmers with medium-size or large holdings \nby Rs50,000 or more. Increased nonagricultural investment mainly by the non-poor, occurred \nin enterprises ranging from small shops and service businesses to transport enterprises. \n \nSocial service delivery, access, and social status of the villages have improved, with increased \nattendance  by  teachers  and  health  personnel,  and  more  frequent  supplies  for  various \ngovernment poverty relief programs.  Access to social services beyond the village improved \nbecause improved transportation services made distant services accessible on a daily, year-\nround basis. Attendance at middle and high schools outside the village increased. All groups, \nincluding the poorest, commented on the benefit that the upgrading had on increasing the \nsocial status of the village and the families living there. \n \nGender  Impacts:  Improved  connectivity  and  transportation  improved  the  conditions  and \nopportunities for raising the social, educational, and health status of girls and women, and \npreconditions for safe motherhood. In one village it was recorded that more girls were being \nsent  to  high  school  outside  the  village  when  transport  services  improved.  Women  also \nbenefited from more frequent contact with their families in distant locations. \n \nPoverty  Impacts:  Control  studies  (conducted  close  to  project  locations  during  project \npreparation)  of  communities  provided  with  upgraded  all-weather  roads  in  recent  years \nconfirmed that the Project will decrease poverty by removing economic and social development \nbarriers created by isolation. The studies showed that in both states quality and frequency of \nservice delivery within the villages improved and access to social services beyond the village\u2014\nincluding health, education, finance, veterinary and agricultural support services\u2014and various \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \npoverty relief and affirmative action programs for disadvantaged groups became available on a \ndaily, year-round basis. Attendance at middle and high schools outside the village increased, \nparticularly among girls, who were permitted, in increasing numbers, to continue education \nbeyond the primary level when transport became available. The social status of the village and \nthe families who lived there improved.  Improved transport services and traveling conditions \nincreased opportunities for those dependent on wage labor to seek employment in nearby \ntowns, and more opportunities to commute between the workplace and village. Some landless \nhouseholds benefited from new opportunities to make small investments such as raising cows \nand operating roadside stalls.    \n \nThe studies showed that economic diversification occurs rapidly following the provision of all-\nweather road access to district markets, increasing the incomes of farmers in all income \ngroups.  Production  and  marketing  of  high-value  perishable  products  such  as  milk  and \nvegetables  became  possible  on  a  commercial  basis,  thus  potentially  increasing  annual \nincomes of marginal farmers by Rs15,000 a year or more, of small farmers by Rs20,000 or \nmore, and farmers with medium-size or large holdings by Rs50,000 or more. Landless laborers \nreported  that  improved  connectivity  increased  opportunities  to  access  higher-paid, \nnonagricultural work, and enabled many laborers to commute instead of live in squatter camps \nfar  from  their  homes.  The  landless  poor  also  increased  their  incomes  by  making  small \ninvestments such as raising cows and operating roadside stalls. Overall, connectivity increased \ninvestments in nonagricultural micro-enterprises and larger investments in transport services. \nCommunities with all-weather road access are more likely to attract assistance from existing \nand proposed district poverty reduction projects. \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis          Poverty Intervention \n \n      The Madhya Pradesh Human Development Report (1998), which was compiled before the \ndivision of MP in 2000 to create the new state of CG, ranks MP (including CG) 15th out of 16 \nmajor states in terms of human development indices.1 An ADB study of poverty data nationwide \nranks MP 7th out of 16 major states on the basis of rural poverty head count statistics.2 The \nlatest state government data for MP show that 37.4% of the state population and 37.6% of the \nrural population were living below the poverty line in 1999-2000, compared with national \naverages of 26% and 27.1%, respectively. \n \nOn the basis of poverty-line data, the rural population of these states rank among the seven \npoorest states in India.3 The estimated proportion of families living below the poverty line in the \ndistrict project areas is 49-76% in MP and 50-58% in CG, which is considerably higher than the \n1999-2000 state average for MP of 32.28%.4 The Project will be assisting people living in \nisolated and remote areas where economic opportunities and services are scarce. The project \npreparatory studies indicate poverty rates in these areas are well above the rural averages for \nMP and CG. On the MP deprivation index, the districts range from 0.389 in peri-urban Bhopal \nto 0.533 in rural Guna.5 Major factors underlying poverty in the project areas are (i) physical \nisolation and lack of transport connectivity, as well as (ii) landlessness; (iii) uneconomic size of \nlandholding; (iv) effects of drought and lack of access to irrigation; and (iv) social exclusion due \nto low caste or tribal status. Rural poverty is generally associated with deprivation of assets, \n                                                                 \n1  Madhya Pradesh Human Development Report 1998.

The social and economic inequality \nof men and women is a further dimension of poverty, one that is more  pronounced in rural \nMadhya Pradesh. Women's economic and educational opportunities are restricted by early \nmarriage  and  seclusion  or  restricted  mobility.  Codes  of  female  propriety  outweigh  the \nconsiderations of efficiency and productivity, so even poor men use bicycles to transport fuel, \nmilk and other goods, but all women (except for those who can afford to remain secluded in \ntheir homes) must walk, and carry water and fuel and fodder on their heads.   \n \nC.   Participation Process \n  \n \nDuring project preparation, participatory consultations were conducted with all stakeholders in \nall project locations. The project beneficiaries were unanimous in their desire for the project to \nproceed, and keenly aware of its prospective benefits to them. The Project is featured in and \ncomplements the development plans of both states to reduce poverty, including their DPIPs,6 \nimprove the quality of life of the rural poor, and increase rural productivity.
