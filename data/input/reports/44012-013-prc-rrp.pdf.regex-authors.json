I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hebei Energy Efficiency Improvement and \nEmission Reduction Project.1  \n \n2.  The aim of the project is to (i) increase investment in energy efficiency in key energy-\nintensive industries in Hebei Province; (ii) promote energy service companies (ESCOs); and \n(iii) enhance provincial capacity to identify, finance, and manage similar energy efficiency and \nemission reduction projects.2 The project proposes to finance the investment through a financial \nintermediation loan (FIL).3  \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC has experienced a rapid increase in energy consumption in tandem with \nsustained economic growth, especially since 2000. By the end of 2010, the primary energy \ndemand in the PRC increased to more than 3,050 million tons of standard coal equivalent \n(mtce), compared with 1,390 mtce in 2000. The PRC relies heavily on carbon-intensive coal, \nwhich provided about 70% of its primary energy in 2010.4 The Government of the PRC has \nrecognized the challenges posed by the rapid rise in energy consumption and associated \nemissions. It has committed to achieve 40%\u201345% carbon intensity reduction by 2020 compared \nwith 2005, primarily by targeting energy intensity reductions.5 During the Eleventh Five-Year \nPlan, 2006\u20132010, the energy intensity was reduced by 19.06% compared with a target of 20%. \nThe Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, has set a target of a further 16% energy intensity \nreduction.    \n \n4.  More than three fourths of the PRC\u2019s electricity and about half of its primary energy are \nconsumed by the industrial sector. The \u201c1,000 Key Enterprises Program\u201d was launched during \nthe Eleventh plan to target the 1,000 most energy-intensive enterprises, which consumed about \ntwo-thirds of the total industrial energy consumption. During the Twelfth plan, the ongoing \nprogram will be extended to cover all industrial enterprises with annual energy consumption of \n10,000 tons of coal equivalent (tce) and higher. It will involve some 16,000 enterprises in the \ncountry, primarily among nine energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel, nonferrous \nmetal, coal, power generation, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, textile, and pulp \nand paper. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Hebei Energy Efficiency Improvement and Emission \nReduction Project. Manila (TA 7788-PRC, approved on 15 March for $700,000). \n2  The provincial capacity development will be achieved through a proposed technical assistance grant to be financed \nby the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The GEF project identification form (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2) has been endorsed by the GEF chief executive officer for submission in November \n2011. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  China Statistics Press. 2010. China Energy Statistical Year Book. Beijing. \n5  Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed. It is also commonly \nreferred as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). Energy intensity is a measure of \nthe energy efficiency of a nation\u2019s economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP. In the PRC, the \nenergy intensity is generally measured as the amount of energy consumed in tce per CNY10,000 GDP.  ", "2 \n \n5.  Hebei Province ranks second in energy consumption among all the provinces, with a \ntotal energy consumption of 267 mtce in 2010, or 8.7% of the national consumption. During the \nEleventh plan, Hebei\u2019s energy intensity reduced by 20.11% to 1.58 tce, which is still much \nhigher than the national average of 1.034 tce. This is mainly due to the presence of many \nenergy-intensive industries, such as iron and steel, electricity and heat production, cement, and \npetroleum and petrochemical.6 Most of these industrial plants operate at much lower energy \nefficiency  levels  than  international  best  practice  as  a  result  of  underinvestment  in  energy \nefficiency.7 Hebei has set a target of a further 17% energy intensity reduction during the Twelfth \nplan, which will be challenging unless targeted investments are significantly scaled up in these \nenergy-intensive industrial plants.  \n \n6.  The key barriers for energy efficiency investments are (i) lack of familiarity with the latest \nenergy  efficient  technologies,  combined  with  the  enterprises\u2019  perception  of  production \ninterruptions and/or loss of revenues; (ii) difficulties for commercial banks to assess cash flow \nbenefits and forgo collateral for such investment projects, which do not generate additional \nrevenues; and (iii) lack of capacity for evaluation and risk assignments for energy conservation \ninvestments  by  commercial  banks,  thereby  limiting  debt  financing.  Limited  market-based \nincentive mechanisms to reward investors for reducing emissions through energy efficiency also \ndiscourage investors. These market imperfections warrant targeted public interventions.  \n \n7.  Several measures have been adopted in designing this project to address these barriers. \nAccordingly,  the  FIL  modality  was  chosen  to  (i)  allow  multiple  turnover  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan, thus providing larger investments for energy efficiency over the \nloan tenor; (ii) build the knowledge and capacity of the provincial government and selected \nfinancial intermediary in evaluation and risk assignments for energy efficiency transactions; \n(iii) reduce transaction complexities and costs owing to familiarity and experience gained by the \nproject management office (PMO) and the financial intermediary from the initial subprojects; and \n(iv) enhance governance and improve safeguard compliance for energy efficiency investments \nbeyond the first batch of subprojects.   \n \n8.  The ESCOs8 have been developing slowly since 2000 in Hebei Province. Most of the \nexisting ESCOs in Hebei Province have limited registered capital, assets, and employees. The \nESCOs are unable to obtain commercial debt financing because of the banks\u2019 perception of \nrisks and the lack of meaningful collateral, which limits their involvement to only small-scale \nenergy efficiency projects with limited investment and short paybacks. The proposed project \naddresses this barrier by including an ESCO in the project design.  \n \n9.  The project design also includes the participation of a joint stock commercial bank \n(Huaxia Bank) as a financial intermediary to address key capacity and related issues (para. 6), \nwhich  will  catalyze  more  commercial  bank  financing  in  next  batches  of  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in the  industrial  sector. This FIL  approach  is  similar  to  previous  ADB  loans  for  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  A total of 112 enterprises from Hebei were included in the national \u201c1,000 Key Enterprises Program,\u201d\u2013 a program to \ntarget top 1,000 enterprises that consume about two-thirds of the industrial energy consumption.  An additional 109 \nenterprises from Hebei have annual energy consumption higher than 100,000 tce.   \n7  The underinvestment arises because of limited commercial debt financing available to these energy efficiency \ninvestments.  \n8  The ESCO makes energy efficiency investments in host facilities owned by third parties (host companies). The \nESCO enters into an energy savings performance contract with the host company and will be paid by the host \ncompany according to the verified energy savings achieved.    ", "3 \n \nenergy-intensive provinces of Guangdong9 and Shandong.10 The financial intermediary has \nbeen selected pursuant to a transparent and competitive process, and the onlending terms have \nbeen proposed in a manner consistent with the prevailing commercial banking practices to avoid \nmarket distortions. Prior experience in financing energy efficiency projects and participation in \nother international financial institution funded projects was one of the key criteria in selecting the \nfinancial intermediary. \n \n10.  The lessons learned from previous ADB\u2019s energy efficiency projects in PRC have been \ntaken into account, especially with respect to the selection of a commercial bank as financial \nintermediary through a competitive process and its capacity development which can support \nadditional efforts to mobilize commercial bank financing to the energy efficiency sector. The \npossibility of establishing a credit guarantee facility using the cash accumulated caused by the \ninterest  difference  between  the  ADB  lending  rate  and  subloan  interest  rates  will  also  be \nexplored during project implementation. A complementary grant to be financed by the Global \nEnvironment  Facility  is  under  preparation  to  address  the  broader  capacity  issues  in  the \ncommercial banking sector for energy efficiency financing (footnote 2). The scope of the grant-\nfinanced activities include (i) energy efficiency and emission reduction technology identification, \ndissemination, and design of market-based policy incentives; (ii) capacity building of commercial \nbanks in Hebei Province on energy efficiency project appraisal, including pilot testing of the \ncredit guarantee facility for ESCO implemented projects; and (iii) capacity building of ESCO \nindustry, and monitoring and verification agents in Hebei Province.  \n \n11.  The project is closely aligned with Strategy 2020,11 which identifies moving developing \nmember countries onto a low-carbon growth path by improving energy efficiency as one of the \nkey means of achieving environmentally sustainable growth.12 The country partnership strategy, \n2008\u2013201013 and  country  operations  business  plan,  2011\u20132013,14 identifies  environmental \nsustainability as one of the three pillars of ADB assistance to the PRC. Consistent with the \nStrategy 2020 goals, the project encourages private sector investments. In the first batch, seven \nof the eight selected subprojects are private enterprises. The emphasis on selecting innovative \ntechnologies, in the selection of the first batch of subprojects, is expected to be maintained and \nintensified for future subprojects. The project design includes measures (para. 20) for leveraging \nadditional private investments.  \n    \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the project is improved energy efficiency and emission reduction in Hebei \nProvince. The outcome of the project is increased investments in energy efficiency in Hebei \nProvince. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

The project is designed to provide a suitable financing mechanism and finance energy \nefficiency projects in selected energy-intensive industries and ESCOs. The ADB loan proceeds \nwill be provided to eligible energy efficiency projects through Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau \n(HFB) and the selected financial intermediary. The subprojects are expected to have a loan \nrepayment period of 5 years including the grace period. The repayment of subloans, from these \nsubprojects, will be revolved by relending to future batches of energy efficiency subprojects. The \nfirst batch of subprojects, consisting of industrial energy efficiency projects (component 1) and \nESCO projects (component 2), are described in paras. 14 and 15. Subsequent batches will be \nselected in accordance with the selection criteria mentioned in the project administration manual \n(PAM). 15 All subprojects approved before the loan closing are subject to receiving no objection \nfrom ADB.  \n   \n14.  Component  1:  Implement  industrial  energy  efficiency  Projects.  This component \nincludes eight demonstration industrial energy efficiency subprojects that have high potential for \nenergy and carbon emission savings. These subprojects include innovative technologies and \napproaches  with  very  good  replication  possibilities  in  energy-intensive  industrial  sectors  in \nHebei Province, such as (i) coke dry quenching, which substantially reduces the emission of \nharmful industrial gases and enables the recovery of waste heat in producing coke;16 (ii) waste \nheat  recovery  from  industrial  plants  to  generate  electricity;  (iii)  improving  furnace  control \nsystems and energy management systems in the steel industry; and (iv) replacing boilers and \nmotors with more efficient units. All except one of the subborrowers are privately owned. These \nsubprojects combined are estimated to result in annual energy savings of 236,463 tce and \nannual carbon dioxide savings of more than 603,329 tons (t).  \n \n15.  Component 2: Implement energy service company projects. This component will \ndemonstrate the commercial debt financing of energy efficiency projects developed by ESCOs. \nThe  first  batch  includes  an  ESCO  engaged  in  installing  solar  thermal  water  heaters  on \ncommercial and office buildings based on energy savings performance contracts (footnote 8). \nBased on the experiences gained in financing this ESCO subproject, the possibility of setting up \na risk sharing (guarantee) mechanism to scale up the ESCO industry in Hebei Province will be \nundertaken  during  the  project\u2019s  implementation.  The  ESCO  project  will  result  in  estimated \nannual energy savings of 29,700 tce and carbon dioxide savings of 65,340 t. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The government has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 12 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The longer grace period is essential to ensure the loan \n                                                 \n15 Details are in Appendix 2 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n16 Coke is one of the key inputs for steel making. ", "5 \nproceeds are available for relending several times to a greater number of industries, resulting in \nincreased energy savings and emissions reduction.  \n \n17.  The cost estimates for the first batch of energy efficiency projects is in Table 1.

The Asian Development Bank will finance $13 million of taxes and \nduties. This is not considered to be excessive and is in compliance with the country cost-sharing ceiling and \nfinancing parameters for the People\u2019s Republic of China, approved on 17 March 2011.  \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  The project will be implemented using the FIL modality. The Ministry of Finance will \nrelend the ADB loan proceeds to Hebei provincial government (HPG) on the same terms and \nconditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. The loan proceeds will be onlent to the \nsubborrowers by HPG through the selected financial intermediary (Huaxia Bank). HFB will issue \nfund management regulations, clearly laying out the roles and responsibilities of HFB, PMO, \nand Huaxia Bank with respect to the management of the ADB loan proceeds.  \n \n19.  HFB, the financial intermediary, subborrowers, and the guarantors of subloans, if any, \nwill enter into subloan agreements with respect to the subprojects. The onlending interest rate \non subproject loans will be the higher of (i) the interest rate payable by HPG to the Ministry of \nFinance, and (ii) 90% of the prime rate set by the People\u2019s Bank of China for commercial bank \nloans having the same terms as the subloans. The proposed onlending rate does not provide a \nsignificant subsidy over the market rates but will provide an incentive for subborrowers to invest \nin energy efficiency investments. HFB will bear the risks of currency exchange and interest rate \nfluctuations. \n \n20.  For the first batch, the subloan amounts will be up to 75% of the investment cost of each \nsubproject.  For  subsequent  batches,  financing  from  revolved  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be \nreduced to 50% of the investment cost to encourage an increased share of cofinancing either \nthrough increased equity financing or commercial bank financing. It is expected that the ADB \nloan proceeds will be fully revolved at least two times during the loan tenor, which will enable \nadditional lending of $200 million and total investments of $400 million for future subprojects. \nThe financing plan of the project is in Table 2. \n \n ", "6 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Selected Subprojects \nSource  Amount % \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  HPG will be the executing agency for the project, responsible for overall implementation \nof the project during the 15-year project implementation period. HPG has established the project \nsteering committee (PSC), which will provide direction to the overall project implementation. The \nPSC secretariat, set up under the PSC, has specific responsibilities related to the project \nimplementation. The PMO is established under the PSC secretariat to act as the implementing \nagency and it is managed administratively by Hebei Power Demand Side Management and \nInstruction Center, an agency under Hebei Development and Reform Commission. The PMO \nwill  enter  into  subproject  agreements  with  each  of  the  subborrowers  with  respect  to  the \nsubproject implementation.

The due diligence on the \nsubsequent batches of subprojects, to be financed by the REF, will be undertaken by the PMO \nto ensure compliance with the subproject selection criteria (footnote 15).  \n \n \n                                                 \n18 Appendix 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Initial Environmental Examination for the First Batch of Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n20 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Financial Performance and Financial Management Assessment of Subproject Companies (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Management Assessment of Huaxia Bank (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Procurement Capacity Assessment and Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The  technical  due  diligence  of  identified  subprojects,  under  components  1  and  2, \nconfirmed that they are using innovative but proven technologies. The subborrowers\u2019 capacity to \nimplement  the  subproject  has  been  assessed  during  project  preparation  and  found  to  be \nadequate and the associated implementation risks are minimal. These subprojects will result in \nestimated energy savings of 266,163 tce/year [y]) and greenhouse gas savings of 668,669 tons \nper year.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present \nvalue were computed for each of the identified eight subprojects under component 1. The FIRR \nfor each of the subprojects exceeds the weighted average cost of capital and ranges from \n16.7% to 33.8%. The combined FIRR for component 1 is 22.7% and for component 2 is 19.9%, \ncompared with the combined weighted average cost of capital of 6.0%.  \n \n25.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR), from eight individual \nsubprojects  under  component  1,  varies  from  18.7%  to  46.5%  without  the  environmental \nbenefits.  The  combined  EIRR  of  component  1  is  28.1%  without  environmental  benefits;  it \nincreases to 32.6% with the environmental benefits. The EIRR of component 2 is 28.5% without \nthe environmental benefits and 32.5% with environmental benefits.   \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management capacity of the subborrowers and the financial intermediary \nhas been assessed and found to be adequate to ensure the loan funds are utilized for intended \npurposes. The subborrowers are responsible for undertaking the procurement of goods and \nservices  and  the  PMO  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving  procurement  activities \nundertaken by subborrowers subject to the thresholds mentioned in the procurement plan25 and \nin accordance with the procurement manual.26 The PMO\u2019s capacity to oversee the procurement \nprocedures adopted by subborrowers will be strengthened during loan implementation. The loan \ndisbursement procedures have been prepared to ensure that subloan disbursements are linked \nto the payments of eligible expenses.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, HPG, the financial intermediary, and subborrowers. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n28.  The  PMO  will  ensure  the  relevant  labor  laws  and  occupational  health  and  safety \nstandards  are  complied  with  by  all  the  subborrowers.  The  occupational  health  and  safety \nprocedures adopted by identified subborrowers and their compliance with relevant domestic \nlaws and regulations have been assessed and found to be adequate. Any subproject that \nresults  in  labor  retrenchment  and  redundancies  as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  new \ntechnologies will not be included in the project. The subproject selection criteria ensure that the \nPMO will comply with this requirement for future subprojects. The due diligence on possible \n                                                 \n25 Details are in Appendix 5 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n26 Details are in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). ", "9 \nlabor retrenchment, in component 1 subprojects, found that affected workers will be redeployed \nwithin the same factory.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The selection criteria explicitly exclude subprojects that have (i) environmental safeguard \ncategory A, (ii) any land acquisition or demolition of dwellings, and (iii) adverse impacts on \nindigenous peoples. The selected subprojects do not have any negative social impacts related \nto involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as financial \nintermediary category \u201cB\u201d for the environment, and as financial intermediary category \u201cC\u201d for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). Due diligence on subproject host facilities has been undertaken and found no \noutstanding  compliance  issues.  Individual  initial  environmental  examination  reports  were \nprepared  for  the  first  batch  of  subprojects  categorized  as  environment  category  B  and \nsummarized in the initial environmental examination (footnote 19). The implementation of the \nenvironmental management plan will be monitored by the PMO and annual reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n30.  An environmental and social management system (ESMS) will be established prior to \nfirst  disbursement  to  meet  national  laws  and  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements for the FIL in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The ESMS 27 \nhas been discussed and prepared to guide the PMO in the implementation of the ESMS, \nincluding the grievance redress mechanism. The ESMS clearly outlines the responsibility of the \nPMO and ADB, where applicable, with respect to safeguard screening, reviewing and approving \nenvironment  documents  of  future  subprojects,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the \nimplementation  of  safeguard  requirements  during  the  loan  implementation  period.  The \nsafeguard procedure to be followed by the PMO after the loan closure is also clearly described \nin the ESMS. The capacity building requirements of the PMO have been identified in the ESMS \nand will be strengthened during the loan implementation.    \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  There  are  no  major  outstanding  risks.  The  identified  risks  have  been  mitigated \nsubstantially through the measures incorporated in the project design. The major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\nDiscontinuation of policies  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is fully aware of the importance \nencouraging industrial  of energy efficiency improvement from a point of view of energy security, resource \nenergy efficiency  conservation, and adverse environmental impacts associated with high levels of \ninvestments  coal-based energy usage.
