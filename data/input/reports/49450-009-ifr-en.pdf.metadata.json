Upon approval, the Board delegated \nauthority to the President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted country for qualifying \nprojects.  \n \n2. \nThe facility will finance the grant to Nauru for the Solar Power Development Project. The \nproject will finance (i) a grid-connected solar power plant with a capacity of 6 megawatts (MW) of \nalternating  current;  and (ii)  a 2.5-megawatt-hour  (MWh),  5  MW  battery  energy storage  system \n(BESS) to enable smoothing of intermittent solar energy. The system will be fully automated and \nintegrated  with  the  existing  diesel  generation  system  (17.9  MW  of  installed  capacity,  currently \noperated manually) to optimize solar energy use, enable optimal BESS charging and discharging, \nand allow optimal shut-off of the diesel engines. This will reduce Nauru\u2019s reliance on diesel for \npower generation and decrease production costs. The project will also support the institutional \nstrengthening of Nauru Utilities Corporation (NUC). Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nwas used to carry out project-enabling activities  such as a Solar Power Expansion Plan for Nauru, \nproject feasibility study, detailed design, and plant procurement contract bidding documents.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry background. Nauru is a single isolated island in the South Pacific, with a land \narea of 21 square kilometers and a population of 13,300 in 2017. It is a small island developing \nstate  that  is  classified  by  ADB  as  a  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situation  Nauru\u2019s  economy  is \nnarrowly based on revenue from the Nauru Regional Processing Centre and the sale of fishing \nlicenses. In the 1970s, Nauru had one of the world\u2019s highest national incomes per capita because \nof its phosphate industry; however, by the late 1990s, the economy had contracted severely as \nproduction  slowed.  Although  broad  fiscal  management  reforms  helped  improve  government \nfinances, the country faces the difficult task of ensuring fiscal sustainability in the medium term. \n \n4. \nEnergy security. Nauru relies heavily on imported diesel for power generation. In 2018, \nonly about 3% of its total electricity came from solar photovoltaic installations; the rest came from \ndiesel  generators.4 All  fuel  is  imported  through  Nauru\u2019s  single  commercial  port,  which  is  highly \nvulnerable  to  severe  weather  events  and  the  effects  of  climate  change.  This  dependence  on \nimported fossil fuel exposes the nation to price shocks from fluctuating fuel prices and creates the \nrisk of power outages if diesel supply is interrupted. The Government of Nauru is committed to \nimproving  energy  security  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  has  set  ambitious \nrenewable energy targets for power generation by 2020 in the Nauru Energy Road Map, 2018\u2013\n2020. Electricity demand is generally flat at about 4 MW. That is expected to increase minimally. \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Pacific Renewable \n\n2  Besides Nauru: the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Samoa, \n\nEnergy Investment Facility. Manila. \n\nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n\n3  ADB provided project preparatory TA for the Solar Power Development Project under the Pacific Renewable Energy \n\nInvestment Facility (TA 9242-REG). \n\n4  As of November 2018, Nauru had 807 kilowatts (kW) of installed solar power capacity. \n \n\n \n\n\fUncertainty  surrounds  future  demand  because  it  depends  on  whether  large  power  consumers \nsuch  as  Australia\u2019s  processing  center,  Republic  of  Nauru  Phosphate  Corporation,  or  the  new \nNauru Port are connected to the national grid. \n \nEnergy sector development. The cost of power generation in Nauru is high\u2014regularly \n5. \nmore  than  $0.40  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  depending  on  international  fuel  prices.  Historically, \ntariffs did not cover the cost of supplying power, so the government had to bear annual subsidy \ncosts  of  $3  million\u2013$4  million.5 However,  this  situation  is  rapidly  improving,  in  part  because  of \nADB\u2019s  recent  TA support  to  developing  legislation for  NUC,  preparing a corporate strategy for \nNUC,    preparing  tariff  and  subsidy  policy  reforms  (including  a  subsidy  for  disadvantaged \nresidents), preparing an asset management and maintenance plan, improving NUC\u2019s accounting \nsystems,  and  implementing  a revised  corporate  governance  structure.6 In  2017,  ADB financed \ntwo high-efficiency diesel generators and a new switchgear through the Electricity Supply Security \nand Sustainability Project, to help supply baseload, reduce power outages, and improve system \nreliability and efficiency. This improved revenue, operations, and service reliability. But the legal \nframework to develop renewable energy is limited; and institutional reforms, tariff revisions, and \nprivate sector engagement for renewable energy are needed. \n \n6. \nBarriers  to  sector  development.  The  government  and  NUC  have  limited  borrowing \ncapacity, and available government funds and revenue from electricity customers are insufficient \nto finance capital costs. NUC operates a 500-kilowatt (kW) solar plant, funded by the United Arab \nEmirates, and is constructing a 1.0 MW solar plant, funded by the Government of New Zealand \nand the European Union. Despite this progress, NUC requires (i) further financial assistance for \nlarge solar assets; (ii) support to integrate new assets into the grid; (iii) capacity building in the \nareas  of  solar  power  generation  and  BESS  maintenance  to  ensure  grid  stability;  and \n(iv) assistance in financial management, gender mainstreaming, and project implementation. \n \n7. \nProposed  solution.  Sector  improvements  noted  in  para.  5  have  created  favorable \nconditions for NUC to integrate new renewable energy assets into its fleet. In 2018, ADB, through \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility, provided TA to assess options for integrating \nnew sources of power and to develop a solar expansion plan for NUC. The TA team identified a \nsolar power system supported by a BESS to be the least-cost option for reducing dependence on \ndiesel  while  improving  electricity  supply  and  reliability.  With  the  project,  the  levelized  cost  of \nenergy will be about $.30 per kWh\u2014a significant improvement from the current rate of $.40 per \nkWh.  Integrating  new  solar  assets  into  Nauru\u2019s  grid  can  reduce  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on \nfossil  fuels,  decrease  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  and  strengthen  NUC\u2019s  commercial \nperformance. \n \n8. \nThe project will finance a 6 MW solar plant and the 2.5 MWh, 5 MW BESS, to be integrated \nwith the diesel generation system already in place (17.9 MW of installed capacity). It will also fund \na project implementation consultant (PIC) to support NUC during detailed design, construction, \ninstallation,  and  commissioning;  and  to  train  NUC  personnel.  The  project  will  improve  energy \nsecurity and help Nauru reduce about 11,155 tons of CO2 emissions per year. \n \n\n \n\n5  Nauru Utility Corporation annual reports. https://www.nuc.com.nr/annual-reports. \n6  ADB.  2011.

Note: All TA completion report ratings were successful. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n \n\nAlignment with development strategies. The project supports the operational priorities \n9. \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  and \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.7 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 because it supports a country that is both a small island developing state and in a \nfragile  and  conflict-affected  situation.  Also,  the  project  will  directly  support  the  target  of  50% \nrenewable  energy  for  Nauru  under  the  Nauru  Energy  Road  Map  2018\u20132020,  and  assist  the \ncountry in achieving its nationally determined contributions under the United Nations Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business \nplan for 11 small Pacific island countries, 2019\u22122021.8 \n \n10. \nProcessing under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. The project will \nbe processed under the renewable energy investment facility and meets the following qualifying \ncriteria,  set  out  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  for  the  facility  (footnote  1): \n(i) the  project  scope  includes  renewable  energy  generation  and  support  for  energy  sector \ninfrastructure, such as a BESS and mini grid system; (ii) Nauru is one of the 11 smallest Pacific \nisland developing member countries; (iii) the project is included in the Nauru Energy Road Map \n2018\u20132020; and (iv) the project is classified category B for environment. \n \n11. \nLessons from past projects. ADB\u2019s previous energy projects in Nauru and across the \nPacific  experienced  issues  with  (i)  technical  compatibility,  i.e.,  connectivity  with  the  existing \nsystem;  (ii)  limited  transport  infrastructure  to  ship  project  equipment  from  overseas;  and  (iii) \nforeign  exchange  risks  during  project  implementation. 9 These  lessons  were  considered  in  the \ndesign of this solar power project. First, the engineering design will ensure connectivity between \nthe grid, the BESS, the generators, and other existing associated facilities. Second, government \ncounterpart  funds  are  being  used  to  contract  a  local  state-owned  enterprise  to  conduct  site \npreparation with local equipment and materials and ADB is supporting Nauru to build a port which \nwill  improve  shipping  during  the  project\u2019s  construction  phase.10 Third,  foreign  exchange  risk  is \nanticipated to be minimal since the project is not cofinanced and only one currency will likely be \nused. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  reliable,  affordable,  secure,  and \nsustainable energy supply to meet the socioeconomic development needs of Nauru.11 The project \nwill have the following outcome: the use of renewable energy within the grid will have increased \nand the cost of electricity generation will have decreased. NUC, the state-owned power and water \nutility, will supply reliable and cleaner electricity. Once this project\u20146 MW solar photovoltaic plant \nand BESS\u2014and the New Zealand project\u20141 MW solar photovoltaic plant\u2014are completed, solar \npower  generation  will  have  increased  from  1,180 MWh/year  to  15,500  MWh/year  and  will \nrepresent  47%  of  the  electricity  generation  mix  on  the  island.  NUC  has  now  approached  the \nGovernment of New Zealand to fund an assessment of pumped hydroelectric energy storage to \nallow load shifting and enable up to 90% renewable energy penetration. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n7  ADB.  2018.

The  project  team  assessed  technical  feasibility  options  covering \n20. \ngeneration  (least  cost  and  proven \nlayout,  grid \ninterconnections,  ground  conditions,  topographical  issues,  communication  networks,  and \nprotection requirements. It also considered connectivity with adjacent power generation assets, \nease of construction, ease of operation, and ease of decommissioning. The design incorporates \ninterconnection  with  the  existing  diesel  engines  and  solar  installations.  The  technology  was \nselected to match the existing systems, which will contribute to ease of operation. The chosen \noption will reduce the requirement for diesel-generated power and thereby reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and the costs of electricity generation in Nauru. \n \nClimate change mitigation measures. The project will support climate change mitigation \n21. \nby  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  particularly  CO2.  Once  complete,  the  solar  facility  will \ngenerate about 12.4 MWh of power every year. During solar generation or battery load shifting, \nthe diesel generators will be in shut-off mode and will turn on only when required (at night and \nwhen batteries are exhausted). Lower diesel consumption will reduce about 11,155 tons of CO2 \nequivalent per year from Nauru\u2019s emission total. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic aspects. Economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 10.4%\u2014well above ADB\u2019s minimum economic internal \nrate of return of 9.0%. Quantified benefits include (i) savings in avoided fuel costs from a partial \nswitch  from  diesel-based  to  solar  generation  (non-incremental  benefits),  (ii)  new  beneficiaries\u2019 \nwillingness  to  pay  for  improved  and  expanded  electricity  services  (incremental  benefits),  and \n(iii) environmental gains from reduced carbon emissions. Sensitivity analysis confirms that risks to \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nGovernance \n\nthe project\u2019s economic viability are generally low and are mitigated by conservative assumptions \nin the valuation of costs and benefits.13 \n \n23. \nFinancial aspects. The incremental revenues from the project are derived from savings \nin  fuel  costs  brought  about  by  the  replacement  of  diesel-based  generation  with  solar  power. \nOperation and maintenance costs for solar power plants are minimal and would be accounted for \nin NUC\u2019s finances by the reduced cost of power generation on the island. The financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value were computed at April 2019 price levels. \nThe estimated FIRR is 5.6%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital at 1.76%. The \nfinancial  viability  was  tested  in  sensitivity  analysis,  which  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nvarious  adverse  conditions:  (i)  20%  increase  in  capital  costs,  (ii)  20%  increase  in  operational \ncosts, (iii) 20% reduction in revenue, and (iv) 1-year delay in project implementation. The financial \nsustainability  analysis  conducted  at  NUC  level  demonstrates  that  NUC  can  absorb  the \nincremental operation and maintenance expenditures of about 6%\u20137% of its total expenditure, \nincluding the system replacement costs scheduled for 2033 and 2043. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nLegal and institutional framework. ADB\u2019s regional TA for Legal Readiness for Climate \nFinance  and  Climate  Investments  included  a  review  of  the  legal  readiness  for  investments  in \nNauru's renewable energy program.14 It found that the legal framework is adequate to implement \nthis  project.  However,  as the  country  develops this  program further,  it  will  be  advantageous to \nalso strengthen the legal framework. The main recommendation of the review was for Nauru to \nprepare  an  energy  act  to  improve  the  legal  clarity  for  energy  management  in  Nauru.  DCIE \nrequested  support  for  the  government  to  prepare  an  energy  act,  and  ADB  agreed  to  provide \nsupport under the regional TA. \n \n25. \nFinancial management. The overall financial management risk before mitigation is rated \nsubstantial. The main risks are weak internal control because of the absence of an internal audit \nfunction within NUC, and weak asset management policies. ADB will closely monitor the financial \nmanagement  risks  during  project  implementation.  The  proposed  mitigation  measures  include \n(i) adding covenants to the grant agreement to ensure adequate insurance coverage for assets, \nand (ii) strengthening internal controls to improve accountability. \n \n26. \nReforms for efficiency and sustainability. ADB is providing regional TA to help utilities \nin the Pacific revise governance arrangements, and conduct commercial and technical reforms to \nbecome more financially sustainable.15 For Nauru, this will include (i) a comprehensive diagnostic \nassessment of the utility\u2019s performance against standard industry indicators  such as revenue per \nkWh  and  energy  losses,  (ii)  an  assessment  of  completeness  of  the  utilities  asset  registry, \noperational and maintenance performance, (iii) a review of financial management and accounting \ncontrols and procedures, and  (iv) a review of sector regulation and governance, including tariff \npolicies  and  procedures.   The  TA  will  work  with  NUC  to  integrate  the  diagnostic  assessment \nresults into NUC\u2019s strategy and business plans  \n \nProcurement and implementation risks, and mitigation measures. ADB assessed the \n27. \nprocurement capacities of NUC and DOF, and found the overall project procurement risk to be \n\n \n\n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB.  2019.

ADB will disburse funds directly to the plant procurement contractor (PPC) and the PIC. NUC \nwill supervise the procurement of works and goods and the selection of consultants. It will monitor \nthe performance of the PPC and PIC. NUC will prepare regular financial reports and engage an \nexternal  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  to  prepare  annual  audited  project  financial  statements.  All \nproject-related expenses will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, \nas amended from time to time).  Procurement will be based on ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n28. \nCorruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998, as amended  to  date)  was  explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government,  DOF,  and  NUC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Overall, it will benefit women \nin Nauru by reducing the cost of electricity generation, which in turn should result in lower user \ntariffs and benefit women in their household and productive roles. Women in Nauru face various \nchallenges, not least barriers to equal participation in the workforce, job segregation, and gender-\nbased  violence.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  proactive  measures  to  encourage  women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment and support their access to technical roles in the energy sector, both \nthrough the project and by changing the social norms that have kept women from working in the \nfields  of  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics.  Gender  action  plan  activities  will \n(i) support women in leadership and technical roles in Nauru\u2019s energy sector, including renewable \nenergy generation; (ii) provide income-generating opportunities for women in skilled and unskilled \nwork; (iii) help institutions develop and adopt a gender strategy and policies (e.g., maternity policy, \nflexible working arrangements); (iv) increase awareness among schools and students, especially \nfemale  students,  of  technical  career  options,  including  in  the  field  of  renewable  energy;  and \n(v) provide  gender  training  to  contractors  and  the  project  team,  with  a  particular  focus  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  gender-based  violence.  The  PIC  will  include  a  social  safeguards  and  gender \nspecialist, and NUC will appoint a gender focal point for the project. \n \nAll households in Nauru are connected to electricity supply from the grid. The project will \n30. \nreduce the costs of generating electricity, which will ease the pressure on the government to raise \ntariffs  for  residential  customers,  and  thus  benefit  the  poor.16 The  project  will  generate  a  small \nnumber of temporary jobs during construction, and will increase the capacities of NUC employees \nthrough  project  implementation  support,  training,  and  an  institutional  strengthening  program \ndelivered  by  the  PIC\u2014with  gender  inclusion  targets.  Outreach  programs  in  schools  will  raise \nawareness of work opportunities related to science and technology, including renewable energy. \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.17 \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category B). The project will be developed on a 6-hectare site previously \nmined for phosphate. The site and its surrounding area contain little if any vegetation of habitat \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n16 A previous tariff review supported by ADB led to the third-lowest rates in the Pacific for residential customers, with \n\nlow rates for initial usage and prepayment options. These initiatives have benefited poor households. \n\n17 ADB.

The  project  will  be \n\nor conservation value. The initial environmental examination confirms that the project will have no \nsignificant impacts on environmental and social attributes of the project impact area. The project \nwill not result in loss of habitats of endemic, endangered, or significant terrestrial biodiversity, or \nof protected areas. The examination report includes an EMP that will be integrated into bid and \ncontract documents, and will guide the contractors in preparing more detailed construction EMPs, \nto be reviewed and cleared by DCIE and ADB before site activities begin. The PIC will support \nNUC in monitoring compliance of any project activity with the requisite environmental safeguards. \n \nimplemented  on \n33. \n10.55 hectares of land leased by NUC since 2017 and available up to 2047. The lease contract \nwith 799 landowners is for 20 years, with the option to renew it for another 10 years\u2014covering \nthe life of the solar project. The contract also provides for a review of the terms and conditions, \nincluding the lease rate, every 5 years, or whenever changes are made to the official land lease \nrates set by the government, consistent with the requirement of Nauru\u2019s Constitution. The project \nwill not result in physical or economic displacement or involuntary resettlement. The project team \nconfirmed the land ownership records with the Department of Lands, and undertook consultations \nwith  landowners  as  part  of  the  due  diligence  to  ensure  compliance  with  government  laws  and \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  due  diligence  confirmed  the  need  to  implement  the \nfollowing corrective actions: (i) collect additional signatures from landowners of lot sections 249 \nand 265 to meet the required 75% signatures both by number and interest, as required by the \nLand Act; and (ii) make sure that NUC pays outstanding rent to all unpaid landowners who were \nunable to provide the required bank accounts, especially those residing overseas, or sets up an \ninterest-earning escrow account to deposit all the unpaid rent. These corrective actions, required \nas a condition to grant effectiveness, are currently being implemented by the government. The \nPIC will provide additional support to NUC to set up a mechanism for monitoring payments in the \nfuture to ensure compliance with the Land Act. Other key stakeholders were consulted and will \ncontinue to be consulted during implementation. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples who can be defined as distinct \n34. \nand vulnerable live on the island. The population is 94% ethnic Nauruan; the other 6% hail from \nvarious countries. \n \nF. \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nDelays in site preparation by the \ngovernment \n\nSite preparation is expected to take 12 months. The \ngovernment, through Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation, began \nsite preparation in July 2019, about 3 months before grant \nsigning. Grant effectiveness will include a condition for site \npreparation to be significantly progressed before the grant \nbecomes effective. If site preparation remains on schedule, \nthis condition will be met without any project delays. \nThe Grant Agreement includes a financial covenant that \nrequires the Recipient to require NUC to set aside a portion of \nits net earnings towards an annual contribution such that the \nbatteries and solar panels financed under the Project can be \nreplaced with similar performance specifications in \napproximately 10 and 25 years, respectively.  Preparation of \nthe management of maintenance and budget will be \nsupported by PIC, prior to project completion. \n\nAssets funded by the grant are poorly \nmaintained because of insufficient \nbudget allocation. \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nEnvironmental and social impacts are \nnot adequately mitigated and \nmanaged. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe PIC team will include an environment specialist to \nmonitor project impacts on the environment and people in \nNauru.
