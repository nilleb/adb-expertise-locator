The \nAssessment  project will improve the quality of the environment and the living \nstandards of communities in small towns in the Lao PDR. The \nexpected benefits include availability of house-connected clean \nand reliable water supply for drinking and sanitation, minimized or \neliminated flooding and stagnation of wastewater, and improved \npersonal  sanitation.  The  results  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations indicate that the subprojects are unlikely to cause \nsignificant adverse environmental impact. The potential adverse \nenvironmental  impact  associated  with  the  design,  construction, \nand operation of the subprojects will be mostly of low magnitude \nand  localized,  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper \nengineering design and the implementation of the mitigation and \nmonitoring  measures  identified  in  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations. \n   \nProject Description  The project will improve the quality of life of residents in small \ntowns in the Lao PDR and make the small towns better able to \nfunction  as  market,  services,  and  manufacturing  centers \nsupporting  the  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \n(NGPES 2004), which is aimed at reducing poverty through strong \neconomic growth and increased emphasis on the poorest districts. \n \nThe outcomes of the project will be (i) improved access, quality, \nreliability, and sustainability of water supply services in about 12 \nsmall towns in the northern and central regions of the country; and \n(ii) improved living conditions in the small towns through urban \nand village environmental improvements.  \n   \nRationale  Residents in small towns in the Lao PDR spend considerable \ntime, energy, and financial resources getting water for their daily \nneeds.  Low  coverage  of  safe  piped  water  supply,  poor \nenvironmental conditions, and low hygiene awareness in small \ntowns have resulted in a high incidence of diarrhea and malaria, \nand high morbidity. Such unfavorable conditions also constrain \nthe small towns\u2019 economic development and their ability to serve \nthe  surrounding  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  supports  water \nsupply and associated urban improvement in small towns, the ", "ii \ngovernment\u2019s highest priorities in small town development. The \ngeographic focus of the project is the poor Northern Region, in \nline with the geographic focus of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \noperations,  and  the  Central  Region.  The  project  includes \nsignificant community participation, poverty reduction, and health \nand hygiene promotion activities to strengthen local ownership of \nthe project facilities and maximize the intended health benefits \nand poverty reduction impact. \n \nThe  project  implementation  follows  a  phased  approach,  with \nphase 1 covering three towns, phase 2 five towns, and phase 3 \nfour towns. Supplementary financing is required to finance the \nprojected outputs in four phase 3 towns, which cannot be covered \nby the original budget because of cost increases in the phase 1 \nand  2  towns.  The  costs  have  increased  because  (i) larger \npopulations  will  be  served  by  the  infrastructure,  given  a \nhigher-than-assumed growth rate and a revised design horizon; \nand (ii) increased per capita water demand has increased. \nThe project implementation progress is found to be satisfactory \nand it is expected that the supplementary financing will heighten \nthe project\u2019s impact by improving the quality of life of an additional \n44,000 residents in the four target towns in the Lao PDR. The \nproposed project towns were selected according to the subproject \nselection criteria agreed on under the project.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The project\u2019s impact will be a better quality of life for residents in \nsmall  towns  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  increased  capacity  of  small \ntowns to function as market, services, and manufacturing centers \nsupporting the rural hinterlands. The outcomes of the project will \nbe  (i) more  accessible,  better-quality,  reliable,  and  sustainable \nwater supply services; and (ii) improved environmental conditions \nin  the  small  towns.  These  outcomes  will  be  achieved  through \n(i) the construction of new water supply systems using appropriate \ntechnologies; (ii) the rehabilitation and improvement of selected \nurban  facilities,  i.e.,  sanitation,  drainage,  roads,  and  bridges; \n(iii) the  promotion  of  public  hygiene  awareness  and  public \nparticipation  in  village  improvement  initiatives;  and \n(iv) the strengthening  of  sector  capacity  to  plan,  manage,  and \nregulate water supply and sanitation facilities and services. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $32.1 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  supplementary  grant  of \n$6.6 million  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  resources.  The \ngovernment will finance the taxes and duties and the resettlement \ncosts. Asian Development Fund grant financing for the project is \njustified:  (i) the  sector\u2019s  investment  demand  is  huge  but  the \ngovernment is in a very difficult fiscal situation, (ii) water supply \nand  sanitation  are  basic  human  needs,  (iii) the  project  will \n ", "iii \ncontribute  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals, \n(iv) the  project  has  potential  for  significant  poverty  reduction \nimpact,  and  (v) the  government  is  strongly  committed  to \ndeveloping the sector. \n \nThe financing plan is summarized in the table. \n \nFinancing Plan \n  Amount ($ million)   \nPhase 1, 2, \nPhase 1 and  Phase 3  and 3 \nSource  2 Towns  Towns  Towns  % \nADB   9.80  6.80a  16.60  51.6\nOFID  8.15  0.84  8.99  28.0\nNORAD  2.55    2.55  7.9\nGovernment  3.15  0.76  3.91  12.2\nBeneficiaries  0.06  0.03  0.09  0.3\n  Total  23.71  8.43  32.14  100.0\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NORAD  =  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment Cooperation, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \na Financed from ADB. 2005.

The  subsidiary  loan  will  have  an \ninterest rate of 6.4%, a maturity period of 25 years, including a \n6-year grace period. The balance\u250070% of the costs of the water \nsupply schemes\u2500will be provided as a grant. \n \nAll  other  expenditure  will  be  financed  with  a  grant  from  the \ngovernment.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until September 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (formerly Ministry of \nCommunication, Transport, Posts and Construction) is the current \nexecuting agency and will continue to be the executing agency for \nthe project. \n   \n ", "iv \nImplementation  The  implementation  arrangements  will  remain  the  same.  The \nArrangements  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  will  be  the  executing \nagency  and  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and \ntransport will be the implementing agencies. The existing project \ncoordination unit will (i) supervise overall project implementation, \nprogramming, budgeting, and financial planning and accounting; \n(ii) provide  administrative  and  technical  support  to  project \nimplementation units; (iii) prepare consolidated project progress \nreports  and  the  project  completion  report;  and  (iv) consolidate \nproject accounting, auditing, and monitoring reports for reporting \nto ADB. A project implementation unit will be established in each \nimplementing agency for day-to-day project implementation. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated \nto cost over $1.0 million, and for supply contracts valued at over \n$500,000. Procurement of civil works valued at less than $1.0 \nmillion equivalent will be undertaken through national competitive \nbidding. Shopping procedures will be followed for materials and \nequipment  packages  or  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$100,000 equivalent. ADB shopping procedures will be used for \nthe small village civil works and supply contracts.  \n \nADB's  management  has  approved  advance  procurement  of  civil \nworks.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nadvance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the project, \nand that the procurement should be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n   \nConsulting Services  No  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  supplementary \nfinancing  agreement.  The  required  project  implementation \nassistance  will  be  provided  under  the  Northern  and  Central \nRegions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project \nimplementation assistance contract. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The supplementary financing will benefit about 44,000 residents \nBeneficiaries  by 2027 in the towns of Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi, by \nproviding  safe  and  reliable  piped  water  supply  and  urban \nenvironmental improvements, which will have a direct impact on \nthe health and lives of the people in the town communities. The \nhealth benefits will come from (i) a safe and convenient water \nsupply;  (ii) improved  environmental  sanitation  through  drainage \nand  related  works;  (iii) increased  use  of  domestic  sanitation \nfacilities  due  to  increased  awareness,  appropriate  sanitation \nmodels, and improved water supply; (iv) increased knowledge and \nawareness of health and hygiene issues; and (v) avoidance of \ndrudgery  associated  with  collecting  water.  The  health  benefits \nfrom physical investments under the project will be complemented \n ", "v \nby  the  hygiene  awareness  and  promotion  activities.  The  core \nvillages in the four project towns will benefit directly from improved \naccess roads, footpaths, drainage, and sanitation in residential \nareas. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from greater productivity \nas  a  result  of  health  improvement,  time  savings  in  collecting \nwater,  and  increased  urban  efficiency  arising  from  improved \nroads, bridges, drainage, and sanitation. Residents in towns will \nalso  benefit  from  lower  water  costs  and  from  savings  in \nhealth-care costs. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks identified under the original project have substantially \nbeen mitigated through project activities and safeguard measures. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern and \nCentral Regions Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \n2.  The Northern and Central Regions Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project1 was \napproved on 25 August 2005 for an amount of $24.9 million equivalent, of which $10 million was \nto be financed with a grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This grant took effect on \n14 June 2006 and the activities began in November 2006. The approved project is scheduled to \nbe completed in March 2010 and the initial grant to be closed in September 2010. \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n \n3.  The government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES 2004) is \naimed at reducing poverty through strong economic growth and increased emphasis on the \npoorest districts. It is focused on health, including water supply and sanitation, as one of four \npriority sectors for poverty reduction. Having been neglected in past investments, small towns \nwith populations ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 remain underdeveloped\u2014overall piped water \nsupply service coverage is only about 17%, compared with 69% in Vientiane and the four \nlargest secondary towns. More than 50% of households do not have any form of water-sealed \ntoilets, and less than 10% of primary schools have latrines. Roads have mainly gravel or dirt \npavements, with low coverage of roadside drains. Residents in small towns spend considerable \ntime, energy, and financial resources getting water for their daily needs. Low coverage of safe \npiped water supply, poor environmental conditions, and low hygiene awareness in small towns \nhave resulted in a high incidence of diarrhea and malaria, and high morbidity. Such unfavorable \nconditions also constrain the small towns\u2019 economic development and their ability to serve the \nsurrounding  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  supports  water  supply  and  associated  urban \nimprovement in small towns, the government\u2019s highest priorities in small town development. The \ngeographic focus of the project is the poor Northern Region, in line with the geographic focus of \nADB  operations,  and  the  Central  Region.  The  project  includes  significant  community \nparticipation, poverty reduction, and health and hygiene promotion activities to strengthen local \nownership of the facilities and maximize the intended health benefits and poverty reduction \nimpact. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n4.  The project\u2019s impact will be a better quality of life for residents in small towns in the \nLao PDR  and  the  improved  capacity  of  small  towns  to  function  as  market,  services,  and \nmanufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterlands. The outcomes of the project will be \n(i) improved access, quality, reliability, and sustainability of water supply services in about 12 \nsmall  towns  in  the  Northern  and  Central  regions  of  the  country;  and  (ii) improved  living \nconditions in the small towns through urban and village environmental improvements. The \nobjectives will be achieved through (i) the constructing new optimal-size water supply systems \nusing appropriate technologies; (ii) the rehabilitation or improvement of selected urban facilities, \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

It has been designed within the framework of \nthe government\u2019s policy statement for the urban water supply sector, taking into account the \nabsorptive capacity of sector institutions. The targeted beneficiaries in the 12 towns will number \nabout 84,000 by 2010, and 100,000 by 2015. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n5.

The project costs are financed by (i) ADB, through an Asian Development Fund (ADF) \ngrant of $10.0 million (about 40.1% of total project costs); (ii) OPEC2 Fund for International \nDevelopment (OFID), through a loan of $9.0 million equivalent3 (36.1% of total project cost); \n(iii) Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), through a grant of $1.7 million equivalent; \nand  (iv) the  Lao PDR  government  and  project  beneficiaries,  through  cash  and  in-kind \ncontributions of $4.2 million equivalent (about 17.0% of total cost). The government will lend \npart of the loan proceeds from OFID\u2014equal to 30% of capital investment costs of each water \nsupply system, in local currency\u2014to each provincial water supply company, or provincial nam \npapa (PNP) through a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB. The subsidiary loans will \nhave a maturity of 25 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a fixed interest rate of 6.4%. The \ngovernment will assume the foreign exchange risk. The remaining part of the OFID loan and the \nentire ADB and Norwegian Agency for Development grants will be passed on to the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport4 (MPWT), the provincial governments concerned, and PNPs as \ngrants. The financing plan at appraisal is summarized in Table 2. \n                                                 \n2  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n3 The OFID loan has a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 1%, plus a service \ncharge of 1% per year. \n4  Formerly Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts and Construction. \n ", "3 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nADB    10.0    40.1 \nOFID    9.0    36.1 \nNORAD    1.7    6.8 \nGovernment    4.1    16.5 \nBeneficiaries    0.1    0.5 \nTotal    24.9    100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development, \nOFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n \n1.  Implementation Progress \n \n7.  The overall progress by June 2009 was estimated at 59%, compared with an elapsed \nimplementation period of 83%. The delay occurred mainly at the start of the project and was due \nto delay in grant effectiveness and in the recruitment of consultants.5 The progress of the \nconstruction works generally follows the planned schedule. \n \n8.  The project is formulated as a sector project, and will have five outputs: (i) strengthened \nregulation and management of the water supply sector; (ii) water supply development; (iii) urban \nenvironmental  improvements;  (iv) participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions;  and \n(v) project  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.  The  implementation  follows  a \nphased approach, with phase 1 covering three towns, phase 2 five towns, and phase 3 four \ntowns.6 The progress for each output is summarized below. \n \n2.  Output 1: Strengthened Water Supply Sector Regulation and Management \n \n9.  The activities are focused on strengthening the position of the water supply regulatory \ncommittee7 (WSRC) as regulatory authority and strengthening the capacity of the water supply \ndivision of MPWT to plan water supply investments and to guide the operation and maintenance \nof infrastructure. \n \n10.  As a result of ADB\u2019s continuing policy dialogue with the government, the scope of this \noutput  was  extended  in  2008  to  include  the  corporatization  of  four  PNPs:  Luangprabang, \nLouang-Namtha, Oudomxai, and Xaignabouli. The corporatization was expected to transform \nthe  public  PNPs  into  more  efficient,  commercially  oriented,  and  autonomous  water  supply \ncompanies. The project supports the development of the PNPs\u2019 capacity for business and \nfinancial management, commercial orientation, and operating efficiency.  \n \n11.  In February 2009, ADB approved the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject,8 which included other activities to further strengthen the sector, such as establishing the \nWSRC as a sustainable independent agency, updating the water sector investment plan, and \n                                                 \n5  Due to delay in government approval of recruitment. \n6  The project as originally designed involved the implementation of 12 subprojects in two phases only. The design \nwas revised during inception. Implementation began in the first three towns for which feasibility studies were ready, \nand was to be done in two phases in the remaining nine towns.  \n7  Formerly Water Supply Authority. \n8  ADB. 2009.

Manila (Grant 0143\u2212LAO). \n ", "4 \nproviding continuing support to the four corporatized PNPs and rolling out the program to other \nPNPs as they joined the project. A special characteristic of this project is the requirement for a \nmemorandum of agreement (MOA) to be signed by the office of the provincial governor (OPG) \nand  the  PNP.  The  MOA  will  help  the  corporatization  of  the  PNPs  by  describing  working \narrangements,  performance  indicators  and  targets,  delegation  of  authority  for  tariffs,  and \nmanagement. It will set tariffs at levels that will enable PNPs to recover the costs of operation \nand maintenance (O&M), debt servicing, and gradually increasing depreciation. It will also \ninclude minimum service level targets, regulatory reporting and funding arrangements, and \npossibly an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism. \n \n12.  Progress. This output addresses the specific lessons learned from the Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Project,9 which was closed in 2007: lack of effective sector coordination \nand regulation; no obligation on the part of PNPs to increase water tariffs, leading to lack of \nfinancial sustainability of PNPs; and low awareness of PNPs and the provincial governors of \ntheir obligations under the loan agreement.  \n \n13.  Satisfactory progress has been made in addressing these issues: \n  \n(i)  In June 2009, the National Assembly passed the new water law, which includes \nnew  guidelines  on  water  tariff  setting  and  lays  down  basic  principles  and \nmeasures, including regulation, for water supply management. This law will guide \nofficials  in  planning,  designing,  building,  managing,  and  using  water  supply \nfacilities effectively.  \n(ii)  Tariffs are being adjusted in accordance with the cost recovery principles laid out \nin the grant agreement, and tariffs were increased on 1 April 2009.10 Although the \nPNPs have not yet formally reported any financial performance data,11 some \nPNPs have reported positive cash flow returns and are preparing investment \nprograms financed with their internally generated income. \n(iii)  All  but  one  PNP  have  signed  the  MOA,  which  basically  allows  the  PNP  to \noperate the government-owned assets following enterprise law and sets out the \nroles and responsibilities of the PNP and the OPG. Specific subsidiary loan \nagreements are signed by PNPs and Ministry of Finance. Of the four phase 3 \ntowns, only the MOA for Nam Keung in Bokeo province still has to be signed. \nThe signing of the MOA is a condition for disbursement. \n(iv)  Four of the PNPs have submitted corporate plans, of which two have been \ntranslated and are being reviewed by the project consultants. Furthermore, they \nhave adopted an arrears collection strategy and allocated sufficient staff training \nbudgets, and they maintain a depreciation account. \n \n14.  Although the water supply regulatory committee (WSRC) has been established, the \nfinancing mechanism of this agency12 is still under consideration by the government. Approval \nwas delayed by the reorganization of the regulatory agency and the proposal of a new water \nlaw. ADB will follow up the approval of the financing mechanism through continuous dialogue. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

Some PNPs already include the full depreciation costs. \n11 The fiscal year ends in September.  \n12 The approval of the WSRC\u2019s funding plan and the raising of water surcharges to finance WSRC, within 36 months \nof grant effectiveness, is covenanted in the grant agreement for grant 0016. \n ", "5 \n15.  The activities under this output are supported by NORAD under a parallel cofinancing \nagreement. In 2007 NORAD agreed to extend their support and increased their grant to $2.55 \nmillion.  \n \n3.  Output 2: Water Supply Development \n \n16.  This output is focused on the development of safe, affordable, and reliable piped water \nsupply  systems  for  about  100,000  residents  in  12  project  towns  by  2015.  It  includes  the \ndevelopment  of  (i) surface,  spring,  or  groundwater  sources;  (ii) raw  water  transmission \npipelines; (iii) water treatment facilities; (iv) distribution networks; (v) treated-water reservoirs; \n(vi) individual metered service connections; and (vii) an office/workshop/store for each PNP \nbranch. It covers the procurement of equipment for O&M of the water supply systems. \n \n17.  Progress. Works in phase 1 towns were completed in October 2009 and the works in \nphase 2 towns are under construction, to be completed by August 2010. Detailed designs are \nbeing prepared for the phase 3 towns. \n \n18.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (footnote 4) also showed that high \nconnection charges up-front lead to low connection rates. Although the project design provided \nfor deferred payment, at inception it was agreed that all up-front charges would be scrapped \nand connection costs would be charged through the depreciation component of the water tariffs. \nThis policy has led to uptakes of about 92% on average, substantially increasing the revenue \nstream and improving the financial performance of the PNPs.  \n \n4.  Output 3: Urban Environmental Improvements \n \n19.  This  output  is  focused  on  the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  small  urban \ninfrastructure  directly  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  water  supply \nsystems,  including  public  sanitation  facilities,  drainage,  roads,  and  culverts.  It  covers  the \nprocurement of equipment for O&M of the rehabilitated or improved urban facilities. \n \n20.  Progress. Works in phase 1 towns were to be completed by December 2009. Works in \nphase 2 towns have been designed but have not yet been tendered, while works in phase 3 \ntowns are under preparation.  \n \n5.  Output 4: Participation, Awareness, and Community Actions \n \n21.  This output has two subcomponents: (i) a community health and awareness program \n(CHAP), and (ii) village environmental improvements (VEIs). The CHAP is aimed at improving \ncommunity awareness of health, hygiene, and sanitation; informing communities about the \nproject  activities;  motivating  households  to  connect  to  the  piped  water  supply system  and \nimprove their toilet facilities; and helping communities plan, design, operate, and maintain local \nurban  services  in  partnership  with  local  agencies.  The  VEIs  provide  funds  and  technical \nassistance  for  small-scale  improvements  in  core  village  residential  areas.  They  include: \n(i) community environmental improvements, such as access roads, footpaths, paved public \nareas, tertiary drains, drainage covers, and improved public sanitation; and (ii) grants to poor \nfamilies for the construction or upgrading of toilets and sanitation facilities. \n \n22.  Progress. Workshops have been carried out and institutional frameworks have been \nestablished in all 12 project towns. The community mobilization activities have been carried out \n ", "6 \nin phase 1 and 2 towns, while physical construction has been completed in phase 1 towns. In \nphase 2 towns the works are being tendered. \n \n23.  In all 12 towns there is a strong desire on the part of the communities to participate in \nproject implementation. Community-based water supply and sanitation units and community \naction teams have been established and are actively supporting project implementation. About \n32% of the elected officers are women. CHAP implementation is about 6% completed in the 12 \ntowns. \n \n24.  The project provides grants of $75 to poor households for the construction of latrines. \nPoor  households  are  identified  through  poverty  mapping  and  social  surveys.  The  project \nprocures goods under one contract for each town, and the community provides the labor. The \nnonpoor households build their latrines individually. The original design included a community \nawareness campaign, after which communities would be motivated to build latrines. However, \nthe initial results were poor, and latrine construction was made a condition for the availability of \nfree house connections. Consequently, the coverage improved by about 50%, to 85%\u201395%.  \n \n6.  Output 5: Project Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building \n \n25.  This  output  involves  assisting  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  and  each project \nimplementation unit (PIU) with project implementation. The capacity-building program will help \nto develop more efficient institutions in the towns to manage urban services in a sustainable \nmanner. \n \n26.  Progress. The project implementation assistance is ongoing, while capacity building \ntraining and workshops have been completed, with representatives of all 12 subproject towns in \nattendance. \n \n7.  Compliance with Grant Covenants \n \n27.  Most of the grant covenants have been complied with. The financial covenants on \ncollection of government arrears and the establishment of a tariff surcharge to finance the \noperating cost of the WSRC (para. 14) have not yet been complied with. The collection of \narrears in payments from government agencies to the PNPs remains an issue that needs to be \naddressed through concrete measures, such as direct payment of government agencies\u2019 water \nbills by the provincial treasury. The MOA signed by PNP and OPG includes targets, timelines, \nand measures to be taken. The establishment of a tariff surcharge to finance the operating cost \nof WSRC was delayed (para. 14). A detailed overview of compliance with grant covenants is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Proposed Incremental Activities \n \n28.  Because of the increased budget requirement for the phase 1 and 2 towns, the phase 3 \ntowns cannot be financed under the original budget. The current proposal is to finance the four \ntowns in phase 3 through a supplementary grant agreement. \n \n29.  The budget requirement has increased because (i) larger populations will be served by \nthe infrastructure, given the higher-than-assumed growth rate and the delayed design horizon, \nand (ii) per capita water demand has increased. Both the larger design population and the larger \n ", "7 \nconsumption rates have led to the construction of larger treatment systems, longer pipelines, \nand  more  house  connections.  These  additional  works  have  increased  the  investment \nrequirements for the phase 1 and 2 towns. The original project budget is sufficient to cover the \nphase 1 and 2 towns, but the water supply and sanitation investments in the phase 3 towns will \nrequire supplementary financing.  \n \n30.  Increase in population served. At appraisal in 2005 a design horizon of 15 years was \ndecided on. The 12 towns were expected to have a total population of 89,000 in 2010, and \nabout 115,000 in 2020. The actual population growth, however, has been higher than expected. \nThe projected population of the 12 towns is now estimated to be 99,000 in 2010 and 130,000 in \n2010. Since the appraisal was done in 2005 but the actual designs were made in 2008 and \n2009,  the  design  horizon  chosen  was  2027,  rather  than  2020.  The  total  projected  design \npopulation of all 12 towns is about 160,000. The project budget will cover only about 115,000 \npeople, equal to the projected population of the eight phase 1 and 2 towns in 2025.  \n \n31.  Increase in per capita consumption. The per capita consumption at appraisal was \nestimated to be constant at 85 liters per capita per day. During the detailed design, however, a \nmore realistic approach was chosen and an increase in per capita consumption was assumed, \non the basis of a 5% growth in gross domestic product and demand elasticity of 0.2\u20130.3, leading \nto per capita consumption varying from 115 to 120 liters per capita per day by 2025. \n \n32.  Required  budget.  As  of  November  2009,  the  contracted  works  were  valued  at \n$15.7 million. It is expected that $2.3 million more will be needed to complete all works for the \neight phase 1 and 2 towns. This will leave a balance of $1.0 million ($0.2 million ADB grant and \n$0.8 million OFID loan). Table 3 breaks down the net cost for the phase 3 towns. \n \nTable 3: Net Cost for Phase 3 Towns \n    Financing \nItem  Net Cost  OFID  ADB \nWater supply   5,760,000  844,200   4,915,800 \n   - Namor   1,260,000  844,200    415,800 \n   - Ngoi   1,545,455     1,545,455 \n   - Nam Keung   1,454,545     1,454,545 \n   - Namtha   1,500,000     1,500,000 \nRoads, bridges, and public sanitation    545,000      545,000 \nVillage environmental improvements    261,000      261,000 \nPlant and equipment water supply    300,000      300,000 \nProject implementation assistance     250,000      250,000 \nand capacity building \nSubtotal   7,116,000   844,200   6,271,800 \nBalance from grant 0016a  (846,000)    (195,000) \nSupplementary contingencies    523,200 \nSupplementary financing required   6,600,000 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \na ADB. 2005.

It is proposed that the OFID loan be used to finance part (following agreed financing \nratios) of the water supply works for Namor, and the ADB grant to finance the remaining \nactivities. The government will seek OFID\u2019s approval for loan reallocation and extension of the \nloan closing date.  \n \n ", "8 \nB.  Impact on the Project \n \n34.  The supplementary financing will heighten the impact of the project by improving the \nquality of life of an additional 44,000 small-town residents in the Lao PDR.  \n \n35.  The supplementary financing will result in improved water supply services, and improved \nsanitation, including drainage, in the project towns: Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi. The \nimprovements will be involve (i) providing 24-hour piped water supply to about 44,000 residents \nin the core villages of four target towns upon commissioning; (ii) improving roads, culverts, and \nroadside drainage over a total length of about 4 kilometers; and (iii) increasing the average \nsanitation coverage in target communities to 65% of households in 2017. The proposed project \ntowns were selected following the subproject selection criteria agreed on under the project. \n \n36.  The proposed supplementary grant will support the following three outputs: \n \n(i)  New water supply systems. New water supply systems will be built in each of \nthe four phase 3 project towns. \n(ii)  Improved  roads,  culverts,  drainage,  and  sanitation.  In  each  of  the  four \nphase 3 project towns priority roads, culverts, and associated roadside drains will \nbe built or improved, while public sanitation facilities at markets, bus stations, and \nschools will be improved. \n(iii)  Village environmental improvements. Funds and technical assistance will be \nprovided  for  small-scale  improvements  in  core  village  residential  areas: \n(a) community environmental improvements, such as access roads, footpaths, \npaved  public  areas,  tertiary  drains,  drainage  covers,  and  improved  public \nsanitation; and (b) grants to poor families for the construction or upgrading of \ntoilets and sanitation facilities. \n \nC.  Rationale \n \n37.  The proposal to provide supplementary financing is justified since it complements the \nongoing initiatives in the water supply and sanitation sector in the Lao PDR and specifically \nincreases the impact, outcome, and development effectiveness of the Northern and Central \nRegions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.  This  project  has  made  satisfactory \nprogress with regard to sector reform and infrastructure development, and is likely to achieve its \nexpected outcome.  \n \n38.  For  each  of  the  four  project  towns  full  feasibility  studies  have  been  prepared \ndemonstrating the technical feasibility and economic viability of the investments. The technical \ndesigns are similar to the designs of the original project towns leading to uniform operation and \nmanagement requirements. The subprojects have been found to be efficient and affordable to \nthe beneficiaries. The per capita investments costs vary from $100 to $190 for the four project \ntowns, similar to the $70\u2013$180 per capita investment costs for the original project towns. The \nrequired water tariffs are in line with the WSRC-recommended tariffs. \n \n39.  In addition, the proposed supplementary financing complies with the following criteria: \n(i) supplementary financing may be provided no more than twice to the original operation; (ii) the \naggregate amounts of the supplementary financing should not exceed the original financing \napproved by ADB; and (iii) the proposed activities should be completed within a reasonable time \n ", "9 \nafter  the  current  closing  date  for  the  original  project,  which  generally  should  not  exceed \n3 years.13 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n40.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The subprojects have limited adverse impact from \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  in  accordance  with  the  project\u2019s  category B \nclassification. Short resettlement plans following the resettlement framework developed under \nthe  original  project  have  been  prepared  and  are  included  in  the  feasibility  studies  on  the \nsubprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D). These resettlement plans will be reviewed by \nADB and must be approved before the civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \n41.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nassessment guidelines. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken and an \nenvironmental assessment framework was drawn up for the project during its preparation, and \nwere  also  approved  by  the  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Agency.  As  part  of  the \npreparation work for the supplementary grant, IEEs were prepared for the project towns of \nNamkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) and with the Environmental Protection Law (1999) of the Government of the \nLao PDR and its Implementing Decree (2002) and Regulation on Environmental Assessment \n(2000). These IEEs confirm the category B classification. The IEEs are included in the appraisal \nreports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D) and will be reviewed by ADB. The \nIEEs will have to be approved before the civil works contracts are awarded. \n \n42.  Ethnic groups. The subprojects will benefit the ethnic groups directly. It has been found \nthat the water supply and sanitation needs of the various ethnic groups in the subproject areas \ndo not differ. Specific actions to increase project benefits or mitigate adverse project impact \namong some ethnic groups have been included in the social strategies and short resettlement \nplans for the four subprojects. \n \nE.  Revised Cost Estimates \n \n43.  The  investment  costs  for  the  phase  1  and  2  towns  combined  is  estimated  to  be \n$23.7 million, while the cost for the phase 3 towns is about $8.4 million, bringing the total \ninvestment costs to $32.1 million, including taxes and duties of $2.7 million (Table 4).  \n \nTable 4: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Amounta \nPhase 1  Phase 1, \nand 2  Phase 3  2, and 3 \nItem    Towns  Towns  Towns \nA.

Revised Financing Plan \n \n44.  It is proposed that ADB increase its grant finances to $16.6 million by providing a \nsupplementary grant of $6.6 million from its ADF resources. The government will finance the \ntaxes and duties and the resettlement costs. ADF grant financing for the project is justified: \n(i) the sector\u2019s investment demand is huge, but the government is in a very difficult fiscal \nsituation;  (ii) water  supply  and  sanitation  are  basic  human  needs;  (iii) the  project  will  help \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals; (iv) the project has potential for significant poverty \nreduction impact; and (v) the government is strongly committed to developing the sector. The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Financing Plan \n  Amount ($ million)   \nPhase 1 and 2  Phase 3  Phase 1, 2, \nSource  Towns  Towns  and 3 Towns  % \nADB  9.80    6.80a  16.60  51.6 \nOFID  8.15    0.84  8.99  28.0 \nNORAD b  2.55    2.55  7.9 \nGovernment c  3.15    0.76  3.91  12.2 \nBeneficiaries  0.06    0.03  0.09  0.3 \nTotal  23.71    8.43  32.14  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development, OFID = \nOPEC Fund for International Development.  \na  Financed from ADB. 2005.

The total cost will be \nlower than estimated at appraisal ($4.1 million)  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n45.  The government and each relevant provincial water company will sign a subsidiary loan \nagreement, under which the government will re-lend 30% of the costs of the water supply \nschemes to each relevant provincial water company. The subsidiary loan will have an interest \nrate of 6.4% and a maturity period of 25 years, including a 6-year grace period. The balance\u2014\n70% of the costs of the water supply schemes\u2014and the costs for the other activities will be \nfinanced with a grant from the government.  \n \n46.  With this supplementary financing, ADB\u2019s financing share of the total project costs will \nincrease from 40% at appraisal to 52%. A detailed breakdown of cost per financier for the \nproject, with and without the supplementary financing, is in Appendix 3. \n ", "11 \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n47.  Project  management. This will follow the current arrangements. MPWT will be the \nexecuting agency and the provincial departments of public works and transport will be the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  existing  PCU  will  (i) supervise  overall  project  implementation, \nprogramming, budgeting, and financial planning and accounting; (ii) provide administrative and \ntechnical support to the PIUs; (iii) prepare consolidated project progress reports and the project \ncompletion report; and (iv) consolidate the project accounting, auditing, and monitoring reports \nfor submission to ADB. A PIU will be established in each implementing agency to take charge of \nday-to-day project implementation. It will (i) participate in project planning, feasibility studies, \ndesign, and procurement activities for the subproject in the province; (ii) coordinate the activities \nof  consultants  and  contractors  in  the  province;  (iii) oversee  construction;  (iv) coordinate \nresettlement and assist the resettlement committee; (v) implement the gender strategy and the \nethnic  groups  development  framework;  (vi) supervise  local  capacity-building  activities; \n(vii) prepare  the  subproject  accounting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  reports;  and  (viii) manage \nactivities  under  output  4  (participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions),  including \nprocurement. Mass organizations, such as the Lao Women\u2019s Union, will be members of the PIU, \nand will help implement the project.  \n \n48.  The supplementary works will be implemented in coordination with its development \npartners,  which  are  directly  involved  in  financing  of  the  project,  following  the  established \nprocedures. Detailed information on development coordination is in Appendix 4.  \n \n49.  Implementation period. The project will be extended for 2 years until March 2012, with \na grant closing date of September 2012. This proposed extension is feasible since consultants \nare already in the field and design documents have been prepared for the subprojects and \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n50.   Advance action. ADB's management has approved advance procurement of civil works. \nThe government has been advised that approval of the advance procurement does not commit ADB \nto finance the project, and that the procurement should be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n51.  Procurement. All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant and the OFID loan \nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). International competitive bidding procedures will be used for major civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost over $1.0 million. The procurement of civil works valued at less than \n$1.0 million  equivalent  will  be  undertaken  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Shopping \nprocedures will be followed for small village civil works and supply contracts costing less than \n$100,000 equivalent. Water meters will be purchased according to a limited international bidding \nprocedure,  following  the  successfully  completed  earlier  purchase  of  water  meters.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n52.  Consulting  services.  No  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  supplementary \nfinancing agreement. The current project implementation assistance contract will be extended \nfor the required project implementation assistance. \n \n53.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MPWT. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \n ", "12 \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MPWT and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n54.  Disbursement arrangements. Eligible expenditures will be paid from grant proceeds in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand following the established procedures. The Government opened a project imprest account \nafter Grant 0016 took effect, and the PCU opened a second-generation imprest account (SGIA). \nEach PIU has opened or will open an SGIA in dollars with a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB and other cofinanciers, after the respective subprojects are approved. The amount to be \ndeposited into each SGIA will be based on the first 6 months\u2019 projected expenditure of the PIU, \nbut will not exceed $25,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used \nwhen reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating advances to the imprest account. The \nmaximum payment for any individual items using the SOE is $20,000 equivalent. \n \n55.  Grant proceeds will not be disbursed to a participating province if misprocurement has \nbeen found by ADB or procurement has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement or \nother  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  province  concerned  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \ngovernment and ADB. \n \n56.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting. Following the established procedures, each PIU \nwill prepare quarterly project progress reports in a short, standardized format acceptable to all \nfinanciers, and submit them to the PCU for consolidation and submission to ADB and other \ncofinanciers.  The  reports  will  be  in  such  form  and  detail  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  other \ncofinanciers. Each PNP will prepare its annual financial statements, including the (i) balance \nsheet, (ii) income statement, and (iii) cash flow statement. The project and subproject accounts, \nincluding the imprest account, SOE, and financial statements of the PNPs, will be audited each \nyear by auditors acceptable to ADB and other cofinanciers. The PCU and PIUs will prepare the \nrequired  information  for  audit,  including  information  on  resettlement  implementation,  in \naccordance with project auditing requirements of the government, ADB, and other cofinanciers. \nAudited  statements  of  project  and  subproject  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  PNPs, \ntogether  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  through  the  PCU  within \n6 months of the close of the fiscal year. \n \n57.  Project  performance  management  and  evaluation.  The  project  performance \nmanagement and evaluation (PPME) system will follow the PPME that was set up under the \nproject and is now being used by MPWT in monitoring and evaluating project performance. The \nPPME specifically (i) examines the project\u2019s technical performance; (ii) evaluates the delivery of \nthe planned facilities; (iii) assesses achievement of the project objectives; and (iv) measures the \nproject\u2019s social, economic, financial, and institutional impact. At the start of the project, the PCU \nand the PIUs developed a set of PPME indicators. The socioeconomic data are disaggregated \nby income group, gender, and ethnic group, as appropriate. The PIUs are responsible for \ncarrying  out  the  PPME  activities,  including  pre-project  and  post-project  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys, and data collection and analysis. Each PIU will establish a PPME \nbaseline based on the pre-project surveys and data. Annual PPME reports will be prepared by \neach PIU, and consolidated by the PCU for submission to ADB. \n \n ", "13 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n58.  Socioeconomic  benefits.  The  supplementary  financing  will  benefit  about  44,000 \nresidents (by 2027) in the towns Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi, by providing safe and \nreliable piped water supply and urban environmental improvements that will have a direct \nimpact on the health and lives of the people in the town communities. The health benefits will \ncome from (i)  safe and convenient water supply; (ii) improved environmental sanitation through \ndrainage and related works; (iii) increased use of domestic sanitation facilities due to increased \nawareness,  appropriate  sanitation  models,  and  improved  water  supply;  (iv) increased \nknowledge and awareness of health and hygiene issues; and (v) avoidance of the drudgery \nassociated with collecting water. The health benefits from the physical investments will be \ncomplemented by the hygiene awareness and promotion activities. The core villages in the four \nproject towns will benefit directly from VEIs, providing access roads, footpaths, and improved \ndrainage and sanitation in residential areas. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from enhanced \nproductivity as a result of health improvement, time savings in collecting water, and increased \nurban efficiency due to improved roads, bridges, drainage, and sanitation. Residents in towns \nwill also benefit from lower water costs and from savings in health-care costs. \n \n59.  A social analysis was carried out during project appraisal and a poverty reduction and \nsocial  strategy,  a  gender  strategy,  and  all  required  safeguard  documents,  including  a \nresettlement framework and an ethnic groups development framework, have been prepared. \nThese documents are applicable to the works to be financed by the proposed supplementary \nfinancing. The poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 6.  \n \n60.  Gender impact. While both men and women will benefit from the project activities, \nwomen will benefit more in terms of time savings, reduced drudgery, and improved family \nhealth. Women perform the bulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. \nThey are generally responsible for water collection, family hygiene and sanitation, and the care \nof sick family members. The construction of new public toilet facilities will take into consideration \nspecific gender needs, particularly the privacy needs of women. Particular attention will be given \nto involving women in employment, decision making, learning, and training activities under the \nproject. For instance, qualified women will be eligible for at least 30% of new jobs generated by \nthe project in the community (i.e., O&M of community-based initiatives). A gender strategy for \nthe project is in Appendix 7. \n \n61.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The adverse impact from LAR will be insignificant. \nOnly 12 households will experience major impact;14 of these, two will need resettlement. About \n525 households will incur temporary losses, for which they will be compensated if eligible. The \nsummary resettlement plan is in Appendix 8 and short resettlement plans are included in the \nappraisal reports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n62.  Environmental  impact.  In  accordance  with  the  project\u2019s  category B  environmental \nclassification (nonsensitive), IEEs have been carried out for each of the subprojects. The IEEs \nshowed  no  significant  adverse  impact.  Potential  negative  impact  will  occur  mainly  during \nconstruction and will be temporary, minor, and localized in extent and can be mitigated to \nacceptable levels. The summary IEE is in Appendix 9 and IEEs are included in the appraisal \nreports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n                                                 \n14 Households that will experience major impact are those that will be (i) physically displaced from housing, or (ii) lose \nmore than 10% of their income source, or (iii) lose more than 40% of their residential structure. \n ", "14 \n63.  Economic and financial benefits. For the four subproject towns, the economic internal \nrate of return has been calculated for the water supply works and the urban environmental \nimprovement works. The economic opportunity cost of capital is 12% in real terms. The results \nshow that the economic internal rate of return varies from 19% to 26% for the water supply \nworks, and 13% to 22% for the urban environmental improvement works, making the works \neconomically viable. \n \n64.  The financial analysis shows that the agreed financial objectives of cost recovery (i.e., \nfull O&M cost and gradually increasing portion of annual depreciation) and debt service (not less \nthan 1.2 times) for the sector can be met. The attainment of the financial objectives, however, \nwill  require  tariffs  to  be  periodically  raised  in  line  with  the  Water  Supply  Authority\u2019s \nrecommendations  and  to  keep  pace  with  inflation.  The  summary  financial  and  economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 10, and detailed financial and economic analyses are included in the \nappraisal reports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n65.  Risks. The main risks associated with the additional works are (i) the limited human \nresources and institutional capacities in the provinces and districts; (ii) uncertainty regarding \ntariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of  water  supply  services;  (iii) insufficient \ncommunity  participation  in  project  implementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor; \n(iv) adverse effects of resettlement on poor and vulnerable households; (v) inadequate time and \nresources for assessing raw water; and (vi) inadequate sources for O&M of project facilities.  \n \n66.  The  project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  those  risks.  The  measures  include \n(i) capacity building for the PIU and for the communication, transport, posts, and construction \noffices and water supply and sanitation offices, to strengthen their managerial and operational \ncapacities;  (ii) commitment  to  tariff  reforms  and  associated  assurances  by  the  respective \nprovincial governments; (iii) a participation program, gender strategy, and public awareness \ncampaigns; (iv) a resettlement framework and resettlement plans to ensure that all affected \npeople will at least maintain or improve their living standards after project completion; and \n(v) local ownership intensified through community participation in designing, implementing, and \nmaintaining  the  facilities  and  the  provincial  government\u2019s  commitment  to  adequate  budget \nallocation for O&M.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Each  participating  PNP  will  collect  all  water  bill  arrears  in  accordance  with \narrears collection action plans and need to be agreed on by the government, \nADB,  and  each  participating  PNP  before  any  disbursement  of  funds  to  the \nrelevant subproject. Each participating PNP will reduce accounts receivable to \nless than 90 days within 24 months after effectiveness of the supplementary \ngrant, and will maintain accounts receivable of less than 90 days thereafter. \nWhere government agency water bills are outstanding for 60 days or more, the \ngovernment will, within a further 30 days, allocate to the PNP special funds \nconcerned  from  its  budgetary  resources  sufficient  to  fully  liquidate  the \noutstanding accounts. \n ", "15 \n(ii)  For each subproject, the relevant PNPs will waive up-front fees for household \nconnections in the core project villages (domestic consumers only) in accordance \nwith the relevant scheme agreed on by the government and ADB. Households \nthat receive a connection will be required to pay a monthly fee that covers water \nconsumption, turnover tax, and basic administration. \n(iii)  The government will provide funds for sanitation improvements as a grant for \npoor households (the equivalent of $75 for each household that elects to connect \nto the water supply to construct toilets with septic tanks, and a smaller amount for \nthose who decide not to connect, to improve their toilet facilities), subject to \nsatisfactory completion of sanitation facilities. The household eligibility criteria \nand the operating procedure will be determined by the provincial governments \nconcerned,  in  conjunction  with  participating  PNPs  and  local  community \norganizations, and will be satisfactory to ADB. \n(iv)  The government will relend 30% of the costs of the water supply schemes in a \nsubproject as a subsidiary loan to each relevant PNP. The subsidiary loan will \nhave an interest rate of 6.4% and a maturity period of 25 years, including a \n6-year  grace  period.  The  balance\u201470%  of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply \nschemes\u2014will be provided to the relevant PNP as a grant. A subsidiary loan \nagreement, acceptable to ADB, will be signed and duly executed before any \ndisbursement of funds to the relevant subproject. \n(v)  Each  participating  PNP  shall  adopt  a  provincial  utility-wide  progressive  tariff \nstructure with three consumption blocks prior to disbursement of funds to the \nrelevant subproject. The tariffs must be set at such levels to (a) recover full O&M \nand gradually increasing depreciation, and (b) maintain a debt service coverage \nratio of 1.2:1. Each PNP will undertake an annual tariff review, satisfactory to \nADB and the government, and will implement tariff adjustments by 1 April of each \nyear. \n(vi)  MPWT will ensure that LAR for each subproject town is not significant and is \ndone  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), as set out in the resettlement framework \nand short resettlement plan for each subproject town. A short resettlement plan \nfor  each  subproject  town  will  be  prepared,  updated  as  required,  and \nimplemented.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  government  regulations  and \nADB policy, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. \n(vii)  MPWT  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  designed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous  peoples  policy  and  the  applicable  framework  agreed  on  by  the \ngovernment and ADB. MPWT will further ensure that all ethnic groups have \nequitable opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, and O&M activities \nunder the project. \n(viii)  MPWT will implement the gender strategy prepared for the project in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development. The government will ensure that \nwomen  receive  at  least  30%  of  new  jobs  generated  by  community-based \ninitiatives under the project and that at least 30% of persons in each community \naction team and each water supply and sanitation unit are women. \n(ix)  The  government  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and  regulations  governing \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), \nare  followed.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  recipient\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, then ADB\u2019s policy requirements will \napply. The government will ensure that MPWT conducts unexploded ordinance \nsurvey  and  clearance,  certifies  completion  of  such  clearance  to  ADB,  and \nprepares  an  environmental  assessment  for  each  subproject,  meeting  the \n ", "16 \nrequirements of the IEE and environmental assessment and review procedures, \nfor submission to ADB for approval before a subproject is approved. MPWT will \nensure that the IEE in a local language will be available on request at the PIU \noffice of each subproject town for the public and other interested parties before \nthe relevant subproject starts. \n(x)  The government will cause MPWT and the PNPs to ensure that the construction \ncontractors (a) provide timely payment of wages and safe working conditions to \nall  workers  and  are  monitored  by  the  PCU  and  PIUs;  (b) promote  women\u2019s \nemployment,  where  appropriate;  (c) pay  equal  wages  to  men  and  women \nemployees for the same kind of work; (d) do not employ child labor, as required \nby  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  government;  (e) maximize  the \nemployment of local poor people who meet the job and efficiency requirements \nfor  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  project;  and  (f) include  specific \nprovisions to give effect to this clause in the works contracts and strictly monitor \ntheir compliance. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement for Subprojects \n \n68.  The subsidiary loan agreement in form and substance satisfactory to ADB has been \nexecuted between the Ministry of Finance and the PNP responsible for the subproject.  \n \n69.  The MOA in form and substance satisfactory to ADB has been executed between the \nOPG and the relevant PNP responsible for the subproject. \n \n70.  An  arrears  collection  action  plan  acceptable  to  ADB  has  been  agreed  on  by  the \ngovernment and the PNP responsible for the subproject. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n71.

Major Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities  \n \n1.  Several  development  partners  provide  assistance  to  the  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation sector. The Northern and Central Region Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the project) is supported by ADB, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund \nfor  International  Development  (OFID),  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation \n(NORAD), and United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT).  \n \n2.  A French water utility (SEDIF) promotes private investment in the urban water supply \nand through a nonprofit association, the Research and Technological Exchange Group (GRET), \nwhich provides output-based subsidies targeted at the poor. GRET is assisting the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport (MPWT) to implement private water supply concessions.  \n \n3.  NORAD has provided substantial assistance to develop the capacity of the Water Supply \nRegulatory Committee and the Water Supply Department of MPWT, and has been a key partner \nfor previous and ongoing ADB projects.  \n \n4.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  has  provided  funds  to  develop \nVientiane\u2019s water system and assistance in building the capacity of PNPs.  \n \n5.  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) has also supported capacity development \nfor PNPs through the construction of the Waterworks Technology Training Center in Vientiane \nand development of training courses.  \n \n6.  UN-HABITAT  is  assisting  MPWT  to  develop  community-based  piped  water  supply \nschemes in small towns.  \n \n7.  The World Bank\u2019s WSP-EAP, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World \nHealth Organization (WHO), and UN-HABITAT are key partners in hygiene awareness and \npromotion in communities and schools. ADB and the International Finance Cooperation (IFC) \nare also working with the Government to implement the Enterprise Law and the World Bank and \nthe IFC are supporting State Owned Enterprises governance and reform. \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n \n8.   Since the mid 1990s ADB has been and continues to be the dominant development \npartner in the water supply and sanitation sector. Through its partnership with the Government, \na sector investment plan and sector policy was developed in the late 1990s, which provided \nguidance for the Government and other development partners on how the sector could be \nfunded and developed.  \n \n9.  Furthermore, sector coordination takes place when preparing new projects, through \nindividual  meetings  or  workshops.  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  relatively  small  number  of \ndevelopment partners involved in the sector, this coordination has proven to be effective. The \nproject itself forms a solid basis for sector coordination itself, since several partners are directly \ninvolved in its implementation. \n \nC.  Achievements, Issues and Recommendations \n \n10.  Although ADB has been by far the largest and most endurable development partner, \nother partners and agencies have had some involvement in the sector from time to time. \n ", "34  Appendix 4   \nAlthough JICA and AFD have made quite sizable investments, other donors have generally \nprovided assistance on a much smaller scale and generally aimed at smaller communities. ADB \nin partnership with NORAD has worked almost exclusively with the Government on a successful \nprogram of sector reform.  \n \n11.  In more recent times, and especially with the enactment of the Water Supply Law and \nEnterprise Law, the Government recognized the need for structural sector coordination, led by \nthe government. The  recently approved Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject1 includes support to  the WSD to convene development partner consultation meetings \ntwice  a  year  and  to  establish  a  project  and/or  sector  website,  which  will  include  project \ninformation and will be linked to the MPWT website. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nGovernment  socioeconomic  development  strategies  (i.e.,  National  Fifth  Five-Year  Socio-Economic  Plan,  2001\u20132005) \nprioritize basic infrastructure and services in urban areas, including small towns in the Northern and Central regions. The \nNorthern Region is the focus of the country strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The region has the highest \nincidence of poverty, at 52% in 2003, and 25 of the country\u2019s 47 poor districts officially identified by the Government of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) as priority for development. The Central Region has a poverty incidence of \n35% and 16 priority poor districts. The poverty reduction partnership agreement (September 2001) between ADB and the \ngovernment includes small towns development as one of the key operational priorities to enhance reciprocal linkages \nbetween urban and rural areas. Specifically, the agreement highlights (i) integrating rural producers with urban markets, \n(ii) enabling urban entrepreneurs to trade with rural people, and (iii) facilitating access of the rural and urban population to \ninternational markets.  \n \nProvincial and district towns with populations of 2,000\u201320,000 are classified as small towns. Most of them do not have piped \nwater supply with house connections, and often lack essential urban infrastructure and services. The impact of poor \nenvironmental conditions (i.e., unclean water, lack of proper sanitation, and few all-weather access roads) is greater on the \nurban poor. The project will contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in the Lao PDR. It will \nspecifically address target 10\u2014to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. \nThe project also supports Government Decision 37/PM, Management and Development of the Water Supply Sector (1999). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG, TI-M) \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThere has been consistent improvement in most socioeconomic indicators over the past few years. The country has \nexperienced a sharp reduction in poverty incidence in the past 10 years: from 45% in 1992/93, to 32% in 2002/03. This \nreduction has been associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency, and increased cross-border \ntrade. However, the Lao PDR remains the least developed, as it ranks 135th among 177 countries in the United Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  2004  Human  Development  Report.  Economic  development  remains  imbalanced \nthroughout the Lao PDR, with marginal improvements witnessed in the Northern Region. The Northern Region has the \nhighest incidence of poverty and faces the greatest challenges from (i) environmental degradation; (ii) poor physical and \nsocial  infrastructure;  (iii) geographic  remoteness;  and  (iv) limited  access  to  markets,  information,  economic  growth \nopportunities, and good-quality social services.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nAbout 76,000 beneficiaries (or 40%) are estimated to be poor in 2010. The project outputs will directly and indirectly benefit \nthe poor: improved access to water and hygienic sanitation will improve the quality of life, and reduce financial burdens and \nthe burden on women, who are commonly tasked with collecting water and taking care of sick family members. \n \nThe project has a strong focus on poverty. It will contribute to poverty reduction not just by providing clean water supplies and \nsanitation services but also by targeting the poor. Poor households will receive free initial water connection. Villagers from \nethnic minorities will be consulted to determine the most suitable technical designs for water infrastructure. The household \nand public sanitation improvement component will provide poor households with grants to construct sanitation facilities. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis \n  \nThe Lao PDR has a total population of about 5.7 million, with a population density of about 25 persons/km2. Compared with \nneighboring countries, the Lao PDR has one of the highest population growth rates, at 2.5% per year. By 2020, the population \nis projected to reach 8.2 million people. About 80% of the population lives in nearly 12,000 small rural villages scattered \nthroughout the country, and 20% are urban residents in 145 officially designated urban centers in 142 districts. While the \nLao PDR remains essentially a rural country, urban centers are playing an increasingly important role in its economy. The \n ", "40   Appendix 6 \n \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 6.4% in 1993\u20132002. The gross domestic product per \ncapita in 2003 was about $330. The industry sector experienced the highest growth of about 10.5% per year. The growth rate \nof the urban population has increased nearly twice as fast as the national average. \n \nWater supply and environmental improvements are important in controlling disease outbreaks and epidemics associated with \nunsafe and unclean water supply and improper sanitation and hygiene. Overall coverage of piped water supply in small towns \nis about 17%, compared with 69% in Vientiane and the four largest secondary towns. More than 50% of households in small \ntowns do not have any form of water-sealed toilets, and less than 10% of primary schools have latrines. Limited access of the \npoor to roads in the wet season hinders their access to schools, markets, and health facilities.  \n \nThe project will benefit about 89,000 small-town residents in about 12 towns by 2010 and about 100,000 residents by 2015. \nBy 2010, an additional 98,000 rural residents in surrounding areas will indirectly benefit from improved access to urban \nmarkets and government services. The project components are: (i) institutional capacity building for the water supply \nregulatory office and the water sector division of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (DHUP/MPWT); (ii) the development of a water supply system; (iii) road, drainage, and sanitation improvements; \n(iv) participation, awareness, and community actions (PACA); and (v) project implementation assistance to different levels of \nthe government, including district offices of communication, transport, posts, and construction (OCTPCs) and the district \nbranches of the provincial water supply companies, the provincial nam papas (PNPs). The PACA component will support \nongoing efforts related to hygiene and proper lifestyle, and will coordinate with ongoing health information, education, and \ncommunication campaigns. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nIndividual subcomponents for each project town were identified through public consultations, workshops, and meetings with \ndifferent stakeholders. During project design, community meetings were held with beneficiaries to discuss flooding, sanitation, \npoverty, resettlement, affordability issues, and environmental concerns. Consultations with communities and beneficiaries \nrevealed challenges, strategies, and solutions for project design and implementation. Socioeconomic surveys obtained \ninformation and individual views on current situations and future preferences. Similar surveys, including inventory-of-loss \nsurveys, were conducted among resettlement-affected populations. Special consultations were held with poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds, including households with female heads. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project design helped the project \nevolve to its current state.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to help identify the key project stakeholders and their interests. Primary stakeholders \ninclude residents in urban areas, resettlement-affected people, the water supply regulatory committee, the water sector \ndivision of DHUP/MPWT, district branches of the PNPs, OCTPCs, and the project management unit. Secondary stakeholders \ninclude the principal and district governments, DCTPCs, mass organizations, and relevant line agencies. The stakeholder \nanalysis was helpful during stakeholder consultations for the three sample subprojects. \n \nA participation strategy was prepared to take into consideration different levels of cooperation and collaboration among \nstakeholders. Levels of participation include information exchange, consultation, collaboration, review, and comments on \nreports. Various forms of communications\u2014weekly meetings, workshops, reviews, consultation meetings, technical work \ngroups, and planning groups\u2014were used to ensure active participation, project support, and productive feedback. Steps for \nstakeholder participation and consultation have been integrated into the overall project design and individual social plans.  \n \nThe project supports community-based public services that will allow greater village participation in the planning process to \nbetter respond to local needs. The project component PACA gives communities information on health and sanitation issues. \nWomen\u2019s participation will be important, as they are often responsible for family health and hygiene. PACA also generates \nawareness, facilitates community participation and consultation  with OCTPCs and PNPs, and encourages community \nenvironmental and sanitation improvements. For instance, the PNP distribution supervisors will be an important link between \nthe district branch of the PNP and communities. Playing a caretaker role, each will be responsible for a service area of about \n500 connections. The supervisors will manage and maintain the system in their designated area, address complaints, \ninterface with water supply and sanitation units, and act as the public face of the PNP in their service area. Having detailed \ninformation on the water and sanitation facilities of all their customers, the supervisors will help to improve their sanitation \nfacilities, provide technical advice, and monitor sanitation conditions. A similar arrangement will be set up by OCTPC to help \nmanage and monitor the conditions of the roads and drainage network. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 6            41 \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nLao women play important roles in agriculture and other economic activities, and are responsible for a variety of tasks related \nto water, sanitation, and hygiene in their families and within the communities. For instance, women and children are often \nresponsible for collecting water, often from distant sources. In the three sample subprojects, they rely on open wells, nearby \nrivers, and bore wells for domestic water supply. Unsafe water (i.e., high in iron or calcium deposits or contaminated with \nwastewater) adversely affects the health of individuals and families (e.g., water-related diseases and reproductive health \nproblems). Upgrading roads will improve women\u2019s access to markets, extension and social services, and information. Public \ntoilet facilities at schools will provide more privacy for girls attending school, and will positively influence enrollment rates. At \npresent, less than 10% of primary schools have latrines. Institutionally, women are active in the water supply division of \nDHUP/Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts and Construction, in the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and in OCTPCs and PNPs \nin the districts.  \n \n2.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  Yes     \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 7            43 \nGENDER STRATEGY \n \n1.  A gender strategy has been prepared for the Northern and Central Regions Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The \npurpose of the gender strategy is to suggest specific actions that should be considered during \nsubproject design and implementation to make the project more responsive to women\u2019s water \nsupply and utilization needs. Some measures will help increase women\u2019s access to affordable \npiped water supply, health and hygiene information, and urban infrastructure, and others have \nthe potential to enhance their living conditions. Female heads of households affected by land \nacquisition and resettlement are eligible for entitlements the same as those for male heads of \nhouseholds. These entitlements and specific measures for vulnerable groups are included in the \nproject\u2019s resettlement framework and individual resettlement plans.  \n \n2.  The  gender  strategy  is  based  on  (i) the  three  sample  subprojects  (Muong  Houn, \nMuong Nan, and Kenethao) that have been studied for feasibility in phase 1; (ii) reconnaissance \nsurveys and district-level information data sheets; and (iii) consultations with women of different \nages and ethnic groups, government officials, and mass organizations. The gender strategy is \nbased on the Lao PDR regulations and the Policy on Gender and Development of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n3.  The  activities  to  be  financed  by  the  supplementary  grant  will  directly  benefit  about \n44,000  small-town  residents  by  2027.  An  estimated  50,000  more  rural  residents  in  the \nsurrounding areas will indirectly benefit from improved access to markets and government \nservices. Of the total 94,000 beneficiaries, about 38,000 people (or 40%) will be poor. The \nproject is aimed at improving the quality of life and increase the capacity of the small towns to \nserve as market, services, and manufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterland. It will \nprovide safe, reliable, and affordable piped water supply, essential urban infrastructure, and \nvillage environmental improvements (VEIs) in about 12 small district towns in the Northern and \nCentral regions. The project will also strengthen water sector regulation, policy development, \nand sector sustainability by supporting the regulating authority and promoting policy, tariff, and \ninstitutional reform. It has a strong community participation focus that complements the project\u2019s \nobjectives of reducing poverty, and promoting health and hygiene within communities. The \nproject design encourages a demand-based approach.  \n \nB.  Women in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Project Area \n \n4.  More than 85% of Lao women live and work in farming households. They perform the \nbulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. Females spend longer hours \n(i) working in upland agriculture; (ii) collecting natural and forestry products for processing, \nconsumption,  and  sale;  (iii) manufacturing  handicrafts  for  cash  income;  (iv) raising  small \nlivestock  for  consumption  and  for  cash  income;  and  (v) collecting  water  for  domestic  use. \nDiscussions with women in Muong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao revealed that women and \nchildren spend up to 2 hours per day collecting water from the source because of distance, \nfrequency of trips, or long queues. In some cases, while the water point was within 100 meters, \nwaiting in queues took time. \n \n5.  Poverty for females means having a heavier work burden, poorer health, less education, \nless  food,  and  inadequate  rest  compared  with  men.  Access  to  education  is  lower  for \nschoolchildren living farther away from schools. In Muong Nan, about 5% of 185 household \n ", "44   Appendix 7 \n \nheads interviewed said that female members had attained primary education, while 12% had \nattained lower secondary education. Levels of attainment were lower in Muong Houn, as the \ndistance between villages was greater\u20142% of 132 households said female members had \nattained primary education and 2%, lower secondary education.  \n \n6.  Dependency ratios are high for poor households. Membership in large families is an \nindication that family size is part of their coping and survival strategies. In a strong patriarchal \nsociety, women have few or no land rights, particularly among the ethnic communities. Land \nrights are based on family law, where new land is titled in the husband\u2019s name and is inherited \nby the wife and then the children. Joint ownership depends on individual household preference. \n \n7.  Women represent about one-third of all government employees. While representation in \nleadership positions at all levels is limited, the director and the deputy director in the water \nsupply division of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Ministry of Communication, \nTransport, Posts and Construction (DHUP/MCTPC) are women. Within the district offices of \ncommunication, transport, posts, and construction and the provincial water supply companies \n(provincial  nam  papas)  in  the  three  sample  subprojects,  women  are  found  in \nfinancial/accounting and administration positions.  \n \n8.  Promoting gender equality is an important national goal of the Lao PDR. That goal is \nreflected in the National Strategy for the Development of Women (NSDW 1998\u20132005),1 in the \n1991 Constitution (Articles 22 and 24), and in a number of international commitments. The \nNational Commission for the Advancement of Women\u2013Lao PDR (NCAW-Lao) was established \nin 1991 to help ensure women\u2019s equal access to basic services and productive resources for \nachieving equity, efficiency, and effectiveness of policies and projects. NCAW-Lao develops the \nNSDW and reports directly to the government, while the Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implement \nthe NSDW. \n \nC.  Project Benefits and Impact \n \n9.  The project is in line with the objectives outlined in NSDW 1998\u20132005. Women will \nbenefit mostly through a reduction in drudgery and time savings in water collection. The time \ngained will give women the opportunity to engage in productive activities or family affairs. \nMoreover, women as caretakers of family health and hygiene, will benefit the most from the \nparticipation, awareness, and community actions component. This component will complement \nongoing health and hygiene initiatives within communities, and will coordinate with ongoing and \nplanned health information, education, and communication campaigns, to which many women \nwill be accustomed. For instance, the Ministry of Health\u2019s \u201c3 cleans\u201d principle requires boiling \ndrinking water, cooking food, and cleaning hands before eating and after latrine use. \n \n10.  Public latrine facilities at schools in both Muong Nan and Kenethao can potentially \nincrease enrollment rates of girl children in both towns. The construction of latrine facilities must \nconsider specific gender needs (e.g., separate facilities for boys and girls).  \n \n11.  In Muong Nan, the construction of a bridge will link two parts of the town that are often \nseparated by the Nan River during the wet season. The results will be greater convenience and \ntime savings; better access to markets, schools, health facilities, and temples; reduced physical \n                                                 \n1  NSDW 1998\u20132005 is aimed at (i) reducing women\u2019s heavy work burden, (ii) improving women\u2019s health and overall \ncondition, and (iii) providing access to clean water supply. A new strategy (2005\u20132010) is being prepared by \nNCAW-Lao. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 7            45 \nburden and risk to women and children using the temporary bridge crossing; and cost savings \nfrom not having to rebuild a temporary bridge that is destroyed by floods every year. \n  \nD.  Specific Actions \n \n12.  The following specific actions will be implemented in each subproject town: \n \n(i)  Equal  access  of  women  to  employment,  training,  and  capacity-building \nopportunities, district branches of provincial nam papas, and water supply and \nsanitation units.  \n(ii)  Participation  of  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  in  the  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs). \n(iii)  Preference given to women for jobs in community-based improvements. At least \n30%  of  new  jobs  generated  in  the  community  will  be  reserved  for  qualified \nwomen (e.g., operation and maintenance of community-based initiatives of the \nVEI).  \n(iv)  Equal access to VEIs, with preferences given to proposals submitted by women. \n(v)  Special attention within the community health awareness program to women\u2019s \nreproductive health needs as they relate to water and sanitation.  \n(vi)  At least 30% female representation within community action teams and water \nsupply and sanitation units. These units will be responsible for mobilizing hygiene \ncampaigns, and are expected to have strong female representation and to reflect \nthe ethnic composition of villages.  \n(vii)  Use of nonformal means of education (i.e., radio and other media) for health \neducation promotion among illiterate men and women, especially youths.  \n(viii)  Consultations with women before the designs of roads, drainage works, and \npublic sanitation facilities are finalized (e.g., separate latrine facilities for men and \nwomen). For the safety of small children, some drains may be covered as part of \nthe VEIs.  \n(ix)  Monitoring  of  project  benefits  and  impact  through  the  collection  of \ngender-disaggregated  data,  where  the  indicators  provide  meaningful  results. \nRecords of participation and awareness training will also be disaggregated.  \n(x)  Equal compensation and allowances to female heads of households according to \nthe resettlement framework and short resettlement plans. They will be eligible for \nspecial  assistance  during  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities,  as \nrequired. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n13.  The implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the gender strategy have \nbeen integrated into the overall arrangements and total budget of the project. The PIUs will \nimplement the gender strategy. Representatives from the Lao Women\u2019s Union and the Lao \nFront for National Construction will play important roles in facilitating the participation of women \nand  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities.  An  international  resettlement/social  specialist \n(7 person-months), a national resettlement/social specialist (14 person-months), and a national \nsocial/gender specialist (6 person-months) will help develop implementation guidelines for the \ngender strategy, specific to each subproject town. They will work with the PIUs in establishing \ngender-disaggregated  indicators  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \ncoordinate with other specialists in implementing subprojects and preparing feasibility studies. \nProgress reports from the project coordination unit will provide periodic updates on the effect of \nthe project components, by gender. The midterm review mission will consider past updates and \nmake adjustments, as required. \n ", "46   Appendix 8 \n \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The project is establishing safe, reliable piped water supply and sanitation in district \ntowns, and is improving living conditions through urban infrastructure and village improvements. \nFeasibility studies for Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi  were completed as part of project \npreparation. The scope of land acquisition and compensation in each of the four subprojects is \ncategory B (not significant), as fewer than 200 persons will experience major impact.1 A land \nacquisition  and  compensation  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  for  future  subproject  towns  during  the feasibility  phase  of  the  Northern  and \nCentral Regions Water Supply Sector Project in 2005. For phases 2 and 3, appendixes to the \nshort  resettlement  plans  (Supplementary  Appendixes  A\u2013D)  containing  all  unchangeable \ninformation for these phases were produced. The short resettlement plans therefore mainly \ncontain  site-specific  information  and  have  to  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  foregoing \nappendixes.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The inventory of losses for the short resettlement plans for the phase 3 subprojects is \nbased on the initial design of the physical components in the four district towns of the project, as \noutlined below under three major categories: (i) water supply systems, (ii) urban environmental \nimprovements, and (iii) village environmental improvements. The four subprojects will supply \nabout 44,000 people with 120 liters of water per capita per day by 2027. \n \nC.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n1.  Impact \n \na.  Namor \n \n3.  The scope of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) in Namor subproject town is \n\u201cinsignificant,\u201d as only one household (13 affected persons) will be experiencing major impact \n(footnote 1) from relocation to make way for the intake.  \n \n4.  LAR  will  affect  a  total  of  84  households  (448  affected  persons)  (including  the  one \nhousehold at the intake). Included in these 84 households are 82 households (428 affected \npersons) that will experience a temporary loss of land that will be used during pipe-laying \nactivities. This land will be restored and returned to the affected persons and therefore no \ncompensation will be paid. Impact from water supply works will be very minor for each of the \nfamilies and will mostly involve broken cement slabs in front of the houses to allow for the pipe \nlaying. The households will be compensated for such minor losses, including temporary ones. \n \n5.  The water treatment plant (WTP) site is wasteland owned by the government. Because \npipelines will be laid in the most densely populated area of town, 53 businesses will be affected. \nThe duration of these works, planned for 3 days in every location, will have to be shortened as \nmuch as possible to minimize income losses. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Major impact is defined as (i) physical displacement from housing, or (ii) loss of more than 10% of income source, \nor (iii) loss of more than 40% of residential structure. \n ", "  Appendix 8  47 \n \n  b.  Ngoi \n \n6.  The scope of LAR in Ngoi subproject town is \u201cinsignificant,\u201d as only 8 households (37 \naffected persons) will be experiencing major impact (footnote 1) from the WTP, intake, and \nreservoir. The WTP site is on private land used for teak tree plantation. The private land for the \nreservoir is used as agricultural land for corn, kha (a root like ginger), and a natural growing \nplant used to make oil. The private land for the intake is used for fruit trees.  \n \n7.  LAR  will  affect  a  total  of  64  households  (215  affected  persons),  including  many \nhouseholds that will suffer only minor inconvenience related to the temporary removal of fences. \nOne household will have to be relocated to make room for the road to the reservoir. Fifteen \nhouseholds (70 affected persons) will experience a temporary loss of land that will be used \nduring pipe-laying activities. This land will be restored and returned to the affected persons and \ntherefore no compensation will be paid. The impact from water supply works will be very minor \nfor each of the families and will mostly involve broken cement slabs in front of the houses to \nallow  for  the  pipe  laying.  Compensation  will  be  paid  for  all  such  minor  losses,  including \ntemporary ones (if more than the KN1 million deducted for the free water connection).  \n \n8.  Drainage work will require some land, around 1 meter wide, between houses and the \nroad. This is mostly land in the right of way (ROW) but many houses have extended their \nverandas and selling stalls in this area with temporary permission from the local authorities. \nThere are 28 households (107 affected persons) affected by drainage works. As their land in the \nROW is not titled, they will not be compensated for the land but only for structural and income \nlosses. \n \n9.  Because  road  improvement  and  drainage  works  will  be  done  in  the  most  densely \npopulated area of town, 25 businesses might be affected. However, only 4 of them think it is not \npossible to open their business during the construction, whereas all the other businesses think \nthey can stay open without losing income. \n \n10.  The water-pipe laying and drainage will affect 58 trees of 10 households. The WTP, \nintake,  and  reservoir  will  affect  211  trees  from  9  households.  However,  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) will enter into user agreements with the households that have trees in \nthe required area of the WTP where there will not yet be any construction so that they can still \nharvest these trees at a later stage. In this way, only 5 households will immediately experience \na loss of 61 trees. \n \nc.  Namkeung \n \n11.  The scope of LAR in Namkeung subproject town is \u201cinsignificant,\u201d as only 1 household \n(4 affected persons) will be experiencing major impact (footnote 1) from intake construction.  \n \n12.  LAR will affect 79 households (361 affected persons), including many households for \nwhich there will be only minor inconvenience associated with the temporary removal of fences. \nNo households are expected to require relocation. Fifty-four households (248 affected persons) \nwill experience a temporary loss of land that will be used during pipe-laying activities. \n \n13.  The WTP site is on private wasteland. One household will be affected and will have to \nbe compensated for the land.  \n \n14.  Twenty-three households will be affected by road improvements besides land loss in the \nROW,  for  which  no  compensation  will  be  paid.  Losses  will  mostly  involve  the  permanent \n ", "48   Appendix 8 \n \nremoval of cement slabs and veranda roofs (of bamboo and wood), for which compensation will \nbe paid according to current material costs. Also, 16 of these households will experience loss of \nincome because of road construction.  \n \n15.  Because road improvement works will be done in the most densely populated area of \ntown, 45 businesses will be affected. The duration of the drainage and road works will have to \nbe shortened as much as possible to minimize income losses. \n \n16.  The water-pipe laying and road construction will affect 32 fruit trees of eight households. \n \nd.  Namtha \n \n17.  Only  two  households  (nine  affected  persons)  will  be  experiencing  major  impact \n(footnote 1) (at the WTP site).  \n \n18.  LAR will affect a total of 310 households (1,739 affected persons), mostly temporarily. \nNo households are expected to require relocation. Of this total, 307 households (771 affected \npersons) will experience a temporary loss of land that will be used during pipe-laying activities \n(pipelines will go through the agricultural land of 22 of these households, and through residential \nland for the remaining households).  \n \n19.  No households will be affected in a major way by road improvement or will require \nrelocation.  \n \n20.  Because of road improvements and pipe laying in the most densely populated area of \ntown, 187 businesses will be affected temporarily.  \n \n21.  The water-pipe laying might affect some fruit trees and rubber seedlings (an initial count \nof 49 trees). \n \n2.  Vulnerable Groups \n \na.  Namor \n \n22.  There are five households headed by women (6%) among the affected households. The \nmajority of the affected households (32, representing 38% of the total group) belong to the main \nlanguage group of Tai Kadai (also called Lao Loum), including 3 Tai Kaaw, 1 Tai Dam, 6 Thay \nLeuang, and 6 Lue. There are 22 households belonging to the the Mon-Khmer language group \n(often called Lao Theung), a patrilineal group including 21 Khmu (2 headed by women) and 1 \nPhay.  Seven  households  are  part  of  the  Sino-Tibetan  main  language  group  (also  called \nLao Sung) a patrilineal group including three Hmong families (one headed by a woman). \n \n23.  One of the affected households is very poor (1%) and is headed by a woman. This \nhousehold is of Lao ethnicity. \n \n24.  One  household  (13  affected  persons)  will  experience  major  impact  or  major  loss \nbecause of relocation to make way for the intake. This is a vulnerable household of Hmong \nethnicity and will therefore receive special assistance. \n \nb.  Ngoi \n \n25.  There are 6 households headed by women (3%) among the affected households.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  49 \n26.  The majority of the affected households are Lao under the Tai Kadai main language \ngroup  (also  called  Lao  Loum).  There  are  two  (3%)  Khmu  families  among  the  interviewed \nhouseholds. They are in the Mon-Khmer language group, which is patrilineal. There are three \nHmong households (5%) (also called Lao Sung). None of the affected households is very poor. \n \n27.  Eight households (37 affected persons) will be experiencing major impact or major loss \nbecause of land acquisition for the WTP (six households), the intake (one household) and the \nreservoir (one household). One of these households has to be relocated. As they will be \nseverely affected, they will have to be compensated accordingly. None of these households is a \nvulnerable household.2 \n \nc.  Namkeung \n \n28.  There are four households headed by women (5% of all affected households) in five \ncore villages.  \n \n29.  None of the households is very poor. Seven households are of Khmu ethnic descent. \nThe Khmu are a subgroup of the Mon-Khmer language group. All the other households are from \nthe Tai Kadai language group (also called Lao Loum), although they are from different ethnic \ngroups (Thai Neua, Kalom, Lue, Kheun). \n \n30.  One household is likely to experience major impact because of major loss of land used \nfor agriculture, and will have to be compensated accordingly. This is a vulnerable household \n(footnote 2) and should therefore receive special assistance. \n \nd.  Namtha \n \n31.  There are 14 households headed by women (16%) out of the 90 interviewed households \nin the core villages. The majority of the interviewed households are Lao (66 households, or \n66%), under the main language group of Tai Kadai (also called Lao Loum). Many are actually of \nTai Yuan descent; the Tai Yuan are also an ethnic group under the main Tai Kadai language \ngroup and they call themselves just Lao nowadays. Also under this main language group are \n28 Tai Dam households (26%) but they are patrilateral like many other ethnic groups under the \nMon-Khmer language group. There are 12 Hmong households (11%), under the Sino-Tibetan \nmain language group (also called Lao Sung), among the interviewed households in the core \nvillages. Also, there are 3 Khmu households (3%), which are under the Mon-Khmer main \nlanguage group (also called Lao Theung).  \n \n32.  Only one of the interviewed households in the core villages is very poor.  \n \n33.  The two households that will experience major impact or major loss because of land \nacquisition for the WTP are vulnerable households (footnote 2).  \n \nD.  Legal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n \n1.  Legal Framework \n \n34.  The principles and entitlements in this resettlement plan are based on the laws of the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, principally the Constitution (1991) and \nthe Land Law (1997, 2003), the Road Law (1999), Decree 192/PM on Compensation and \nResettlement (July 2005), the Regulations for Implementing Decree 192/PM, and Technical \n                                                 \n2  Vulnerable: headed by women, ethnic minority, poor. \n ", "50   Appendix 8 \n \nGuidelines for Compensation and Resettlement of People Affected by Development Projects \n(November 2005); the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB); and government-approved resettlement plans for other ADB projects.  \n \n2.  Entitlements \n \n35.  The project entitlements have been designed to provide compensation, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation for lost assets, and to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories of \naffected persons. An entitlement matrix for the project has been developed for the resettlement \nframework at the feasibility phase of phase 1. \n \n3.  Consultation Process, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure \n \n36.  Short  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  (as  part  of  subproject  preparation)  and \nimplemented with the participation of, and in consultation with, the affected people. A copy of \nthe short resettlement plan in the Lao language will be available to affected persons at each \ndistrict office whose villages will have land acquisition and compensation impact. An information \nbooklet in the Lao language will be distributed to the affected persons at the time of subproject \nand short resettlement plan preparation. Affected people will be informed of the process and \ntheir rights to lodge grievances orally or in writing during initial consultations and during the \nsocial or resettlement surveys, and at the time of compensation. They will be exempted from all \ntaxes, administrative, and legal fees. Complaints will be filed first at the village level and will be \nelevated, first, to the district level and then to the provincial level if the affected persons are not \nsatisfied. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n1.  Implementation \n \n37.  As outlined in the report and recommendation of the President for the project, five main \ngovernment institutions are responsible for the implementation of the project. The Department of \nHousing and Urban Planning (DHUP) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport is the \nexecuting agency. A project coordination unit (PCU) has been established within DHUP. An \nintegrated PIU has been established for each subproject; it comprises representatives of the \ndistrict and provincial departments of public works and transport (Department of Public Works \nand  Transport,  Office  of  Public  Works  and  Transport),  provincial  water  supply  company \n(provincial nam papa), and district office of health. A provincial project steering committee has \nalso been established in each province to coordinate provincial and district agencies.  \n \n2.  Monitoring \n \n38.  The PCU will coordinate all land acquisition and compensation activities. The PIUs will \nbe  responsible  for  implementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  Provincial  and  district \nresettlement committees will be established, with focal person(s) identified at the village level for \nactive participation in the design and implementation of the resettlement plans. The PIU will \nprepare monthly progress reports and a final report to the PCU upon the completion of land \nacquisition and compensation activities. The PCU will consolidate the information from the PIUs \nand any additional information from the consultant supervision team in its quarterly progress \nreports to ADB.  \n \n39.  The PCU will engage an independent external monitor, acceptable to ADB, to oversee \nland acquisition and compensation activities for the subproject towns. Upon the completion of \nthe land acquisition and compensation activities, the external monitor will submit semiannual \n ", "  Appendix 8  51 \nreports and a final evaluation to the PCU and ADB simultaneously. The PCU will also submit to \nADB, within 3 months of project completion, a resettlement completion report based on the \nagreed resettlement planning documents, together with financial audit statements approved by \nan independent agency. \n \n3.  Budget \n \na.  Namor \n \n40.  The estimated cost of LAR for the Namor subproject is KN39,233,400 ($4,616) for the \nWTP, and KN47,055,036 ($5,536) for the WTP and pipe laying, including the base LAR costs \nand a 20% reserve fund. \n \n    b.  Ngoi \n \n41.  The estimated cost of LAR for the Ngoi subproject is KN139,967,556 ($16,467), which \nincludes the base LAR costs and a 20% reserve fund. \n \nc.  Namkeung \n \n42.  The estimated cost of LAR for the Namkeung subproject is KN131,968,151 ($15,526), \nwhich includes lost business and structure compensation for road improvement works (total of \nKN80,265,464 ($9,443), the base LAR costs, and a 20% reserve fund. \n \nd.  Namtha \n \n43.  The initially estimated cost of LAR for the Ngoi subproject is KN89,099,572 ($10,482), \nwhich includes the base LAR costs and a 20% reserve fund. \n \n ", "52   Appendix 9 \n \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The project will establish safe, reliable piped water supply and sanitation in district \ntowns, and improve living conditions through urban infrastructure and village improvements. It is \nclassified  as  category  B  under  the  environmental  assessment  guidelines  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken and an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework was prepared for the project as part of its \npreparation, and were also approved by the Water Resources and Environment Agency. No \nfurther approval for each subproject was required by the Water Resources and Environment \nAgency, although ADB\u2019s approval of IEEs and environmental management plans was sought \nand obtained for each subproject. As part of the preparation work for the supplementary grant, \nIEEs were prepared for the subproject towns of Namor, Namtha, Nam Keung, and Ngoi in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  with  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Law  (1999)  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) and its Implementing Decree (2002) and Regulation on Environmental \nAssessment (2000). These IEEs confirm the category B classification. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  This  appendix  summarizes  the  findings  of  the  IEEs  covering  the  following  physical \ncomponents in the four district towns constituting phase 3 of the project, as outlined in the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework approved under the project: (i) water supply \nsystems, (ii) urban environmental improvements, and (iii) village environmental improvements. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Climate \n \n3.  Temperature variation is quite low, with an annual average of about 25\u00b0C, and monthly \naverage values ranging from about 18\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C. Rainfall is more variable for each town, with \nannual rainfall over the last 10 years ranging from about 450 millimeters (mm) to 1,800 mm. \nDuring the wet season, river levels rise several meters and the width of the rivers increases \nsubstantially with fast flow and a high sediment load. During the dry season, the flow is slow and \nthe width is significantly reduced with low sedimentation. \n \n2.  Socioeconomic Condition \n \n4.  The population of the four subproject towns ranges from about 4,300 to 9,500, with a \ntotal current population of about 26,000 and a projected 2027 population of 44,000. Streets are \ngenerally poorly formed and unsealed, and have poor drainage. Domestic water is obtained at \npresent from open wells, rivers, streams, and springs that mostly diminish in the dry season and \nsuffer from high turbidity in the wet season. A limited number of small, basic, untreated piped \nwater supply systems are established but generally serve only one or two villages in some \ntowns. Daily water collection is the responsibility of the females in the household. Wastewater is \ndisposed of on-site. Those people without toilets generally defecate along the riverbanks or in \nthe rice fields. During the wet season, the poor drainage results in much ponded water and \nboggy ground conditions, which have adverse health effects. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  53 \nD.  Screening of Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  The four subprojects will supply about 40,000 people with 120 liters of water per capita \nper day by 2027. Raw water sources have been considered for each town. The potential \nenvironmental impact associated with the design, construction, and operation of the water supply \nsystem includes: (i) specific impact related to the location of the water treatment facilities and \npipeline routes, (ii) availability and quality of water sources, (iii) discharge of wastewater and sludge \nand  their  impact  on  the  receiving  water,  and  (iv) increased  wastewater  from  the  connected \nhouseholds.    \n \n6.  While there may be forest areas in some project towns, the environmental assessment \nprocedures ensure that no water treatment facilities or pipeline route will be located in such \nareas.  \n \n7.  The  proposed  water  treatment  plants  (WTPs)  are  designed  to  provide \npre-sedimentation, sedimentation, and filtration, and will use some chemicals (alum, polymer) \nfor effective flocculation and coagulation. The WTPs will produce sludge as a by-product of the \nsedimentation and filtration processes, and the sedimentation sludge may contain small traces \nof nontoxic treatment plant chemicals. In most cases, the expected sludge volumes will be \nnegligible compared with the overall minimum dry-season flow in the receiving river. The sludge \nmanagement will be controlled through environmental monitoring to ensure compliance with \neffluent standards and avoid adverse impact on surface water resources.  \n \n8.  The overall improvement of water supply in a town will result in an inherent increase in \ngeneration of wastewater, although there will be no overall increase in biological load, which is \nderived predominantly from domestic sources. The project includes a number of measures to \nmitigate the impact of the relatively small additional quantities of wastewater and sullage, including \ndrainage improvements along main roads and in villages, improved sanitation facilities in public \nbuildings, and improved sanitation for poor households. Community environmental improvement \nprograms will provide funds to the eligible poor households for new or improved sanitation facilities. \nThe community awareness program will also promote good health and hygiene practices. \n \n9.  Potential environmental impact, such as generation of dust and noise, and soil erosion \ndue to excavation, surface and groundwater contamination by spoil, oil and grease, and wastes \nduring  construction,  will  be  short term  and  can  be  minimized  through  good  engineering  and \nconstruction practices. Water distribution pipelines and road construction and upgrading will be \nlocated within the right of way wherever feasible. \n \n10.  Unexploded ordnance (UXO) can also be a serious risk in the Lao PDR. UXO maps are \nreviewed  and  local  authorities  are  consulted  to  establish  the  presence  of  UXO.  Of  the  four \nsubproject towns, only Ngoi has been subject to any bombing. UXO pathfinding has already been \nconducted in the town for topographic survey, and further detailed survey and clearance will be \nconducted before any construction work. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n11.  Institutional  responsibilities. As outlined in the report and recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP) for the project,1 five  main government institutions are responsible for the \nimplementation of the project. The Department of Housing and Urban Planning of the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport is the executing agency. A project coordination unit (PCU) has \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Proposed Grant Assistance to Lao People's Democratic Republic for the Northern and Central Regions \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (Grant 0016-LAO). Manila. \n ", "54   Appendix 9 \n \nbeen established within the Department of Housing and Urban Planning. An integrated project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  has  been  established  for  each  subproject;  it  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  the  district  and  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport \n(Department of Public Works and Transport, Office of Public Works and Transport), provincial \nwater supply company (provincial nam papa), and district office of health. A provincial project \nsteering committee (PPSC) has also been established in each province to coordinate provincial \nand district agencies.  \n \n12.  Within the PIU, the Department of Public Works and Transport has overall responsibility \nfor subproject implementation and coordination with the PPSC and other provincial and district \nagencies. Its environmental responsibilities include: (i) assisting in the preparation of IEEs, and \nannual monitoring report; (ii) monitoring and reporting to PCU and PPSC; and (iii) assisting in \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  related  to  urban  development  components.  The \nprovincial  nam  papa  is  also  responsible  for  implementing  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring related to the water supply and sanitation component. \n \n13.  Environmental monitoring and mitigation plan. Water quality sampling is conducted \nregularly during the wet and dry seasons to establish a baseline and provide data for treatment \noptions and environmental mitigation measures. PIUs are responsible for periodic monitoring. \nDuring construction, periodic monitoring and inspection will be conducted to minimize dust and \nnoise  generation,  soil  erosion,  waste  generation,  surface  and  groundwater  contamination, \nhealth impact on workers, and public disturbance associated with the civil works for the water \nsupply and urban improvements. During operation, a water quality monitoring plan will be made \navailable. The plan will provide for (i) daily water quality monitoring (chlorine level and raw water \nquality) at the water treatment plant, (ii) periodic sludge inspection, and (iii) monthly water \nquality monitoring in the distribution system. A full range of physical, chemical, and bacteriological \ntests will be conducted at the inlet every 6 months in the first year and yearly thereafter. \n \n14.  As  part  of  the  environmental  management,  procedures  are  being  developed  for: \n(i) workers\u2019 health and safety, (ii) sludge release, and (iii) waste disposal and chemical handling \nfor  construction  wastes  and  WTP.  The  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  plans  for  water  treatment  plants  and  in  construction  contracts.  The \ncommunity health and awareness program will also provide capacity building in environmental \nmanagement activities such as regular cleanup of drains and collection of solid wastes to \nstrengthen the communities\u2019 environmental management practices. \n \n15.  A total of $170,000 was allocated in the RRP for the project for environmental monitoring and \nmitigation.  This  included  the  cost  of  recruiting  an  international  environmental  specialist \n(6 person-months  over  4.5  years)  and  a  domestic  environmental  specialist  (9 person-months, \nintermittent) to assist the PMU and PIUs in the overall environmental aspects including training. These \nconsultants will continue their tasks in the four subprojects. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n16.  A  community  consultation-participation  strategy  was  developed  during  project \npreparation. According to this strategy, public consultation was conducted in the four subproject \ntowns.  It  included  reconnaissance  and  comprehensive  social  surveys,  and  consultation \nmeetings and interviews with provincial and district government departments, village leaders, \nand associations. \n \n17.  While the participants welcomed the proposed design of the water supply system and \nurban infrastructure improvement activities, they raised environmental concerns including poor \nwater quality, contamination of surface water by water treatment plants, waste products, and \n ", "  Appendix 9  55 \nchemicals, and flooding due to poor drainage. Those concerns were taken into account in the \nselection  of  reliable  sources,  the  provision  of  chemical  handling  procedures,  and  the \nimprovement of drainage channels.  \n \n18.  Continuous dialogue with the communities affected by the subprojects and relevant \ngovernments  will  be  carried  out  during  detailed  design  and  implementation.  During \nimplementation,  PCU  and  PIUs  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  and  issues  raised  by  the \nsubproject communities will be addressed and adequate feedback to the communities will be \nprovided. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  cause  any  adverse  environmental  impact \nbecause the potential negative impact will be mainly during construction and will be temporary, \nminor, and localized in extent and can be mitigated to acceptable levels. \n ", "56   Appendix 10 \n \nSUMMARY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Financial Analysis \n \n  1.  Introduction \n \n1.  Financial analyses were conducted for the water supply component in the four district \ntowns constituting phase 3 of the project to evaluate the financial performance of the provincial \nnam  papas  (PNPs).  As  agreed  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \ngovernment, the financial analysis have been undertaken on the basis of a PNP-wide (utility) \nwater tariff, as recommended by the water supply regulatory committee (WSRC) in its 2008\u2013\n2010 Tariff Review. Financial analyses were conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects1 and  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.2 \n   \n2.  Bases for Financial Projections \n \n2.  The financial projections are presented in Lao kip on a current price basis. Revenues \nand costs are converted from a constant 2009 price basis to current prices using projected local \ninflation rates. Each PNP participating in the project will implement utility wide tariffs that are \nsufficient to (i) fully recover utility wide operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, including \nsubproject O&M costs; (ii) recover utility wide debt service, including subproject debt service; \n(iii) maintain a utility wide debt service ratio of at least 1.2 by the first year of subproject debt \nservice; (iv) gradually recover an increasing proportion of annual depreciation expense of the \nutility  wide  fixed  assets,  including  subproject  fixed  assets;  and  (v)  maintain  its  accounts \nreceivable at less than 90 days of annual sales. Operating revenues were derived from water \nsales, meter rental charges, connection fees (non-domestic only), and miscellaneous income. \nAnnual O&M costs by major expense item (personnel, electricity, chemicals, maintenance, \nadministration, new connection costs) for the subproject were based on the technical team\u2019s \nestimates, calculated on the basis of the operating characteristic of the system. The projections \nincorporate turnover tax of 5% of water sales and 10% of other sales. Depreciation expense \nwas calculated on an average asset life of 25 years on a straight-line basis. Income tax was \nthen applied at the rate of 35% on pre-tax income, or 1% of PNP revenue if there was no pre-\ntax income. \n \n3.  The subproject capital costs are based on the technical team\u2019s estimate, inclusive of \nengineering base costs, physical and price contingencies, and interest during construction. \nInterest during construction is capitalized and amortized over the life of the subproject. The \nfinancial analysis assumes that subproject financing is provided by way of government grant \nand loan financing. Thirty percent of the subproject capital cost will be lent to the PNP through a \nsubsidiary loan while the balance will be provided as a grant. \n \n  3.  Tariffs and Affordability \n \n4.  Subprojects will apply utility wide tariffs. A rising three-block tariff structure for domestic \nconsumers has been adopted in the analysis, incorporating a lifeline block of up to 7.5 m3 per \nmonth (minimum consumption of 50 liters per capita per day [lpcd]) to ensure affordability by the \nlow-income  households.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  domestic \nconsumers, particularly those in the low-income group, can afford the projected water tariff \nlevels that meet the financial objectives of the sector.

Financial Performance \n \n5.  PNP Oudomxay incurred net losses in 2006, 2007, and 2008; the PNPs of Bokeo and \nLuang Namtha incurred net losses in 2006 and 2007 but earned net income in 2008; the PNP of \nLuangprabang incurred net losses in 2006 but earned net income in 2007 and 2008. However, \n ", "58   Appendix 10 \n \nsince the introduction of WSRC recommended tariffs in 2008/09, it is expected that the financial \nperformance of all PNPs will improved markedly. Based on the WSRC recommended tariffs, the \nprojected financial performance of the PNPs for the period 2009\u20132016 indicate that the PNPs \nare projected to earn positive net income each year over the forecast period. More than 100% of \nannual depreciation expense (historical cost) is recovered during the forecast period. The PNPs \nare also projected to generate positive net cash flow each year over the forecast period, which \ncan be used to fund much needed rehabilitation and expansion work in its service area. As a \nresult, the PNPs will require no further subsidies and will be able to fund all O&M expenses and \ndebt service, and generate an increasing cash surplus. The debt service coverage ratio is \nprojected to remain well above 1.2 times in all years. \n \n  5.  Sustainability \n \n6.  The economic sustainability of the subprojects depends on the subproject\u2019s financial \nsustainability. Unless the subproject is financially sustainable, the economic benefits assumed \nin the analysis will not materialize. The projected financial performances for the subprojects \nhave shown that the agreed upon financial objectives of cost recovery (i.e., full O&M cost and \ngradually increasing portion of annual depreciation) and debt service (not less than 1.2 times) \nfor the sector could be met. Meeting the financial objectives of the sector indicates subproject \nfinancial sustainability. The attainment of the financial objectives, however, would require that \ntariffs are periodically raised in line with WSRC\u2019s recommendations and to keep pace with \ninflation. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n   \n1.  Introduction \n \n7.  Economic  analyses  for  the  water  supply  and  urban  environmental  improvement \ncomponents in the four district towns constituting phase 3 of the project were undertaken in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, 3 Guidelines for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects,4 and  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.5  \n \n8.  The incremental capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for each water \nsupply and urban environmental improvement component were estimated and are expressed in \nconstant February 2009 prices in Lao kip. All costs were derived from the financial project costs \nand re-expressed in economic prices using the domestic price numeraire. Taxes and duties \nwere  deducted  as  appropriate  from  base  costs.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic prices using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.05 while non-traded components \nwere valued at domestic market prices. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.71 for unskilled labor \nwas applied to reflect its opportunity cost in the context of wide availability of labor in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic. Subproject components are assumed to have useful economic \nlife of 25 years; the mechanical and electrical equipment of the components are assumed to \nhave useful economic life of 5 years. \n \n  2.  Demand Forecast \n \n9.  Water demand in the district towns was derived from the current population within the \nplanned service area, population growth, current and future domestic water consumption levels, \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n4  ADB. 1998. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n5  ADB. 1994. Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 10  59 \nand a provision for non-domestic water consumption. Households typically use a variety of \nwater sources and do not measure or assess their consumption. It is estimated that average \ndaily  demand  from  existing  sources  of  non-piped  water  ranges  between  40  and  70  lpcd. \nInternationally accepted lifeline consumption requirement was estimated to be 50 lpcd. Per \ncapita water consumption is expected to increase after construction of the piped water supply \nsystem, due primarily to (i) the reduced cost of acquiring water, (ii) improved water quality, and \n(iii) greater convenience and reliability of the piped water supply system. \n \n  3.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n10.  Least-cost analysis was undertaken to evaluate different technical options, including \nalternative  water  sources,  the  size  and  timing  of  water  treatment  plants,  reservoirs,  and \ntransmission mains. The analysis compares various technical alternatives with similar or equal \nestimated benefits. The alternative with the lowest NPV is recommended for engineering design \nand benefit-cost analysis. \n \n  4.  Economic Benefits \n \n11.  The principal benefits that would be derived from the development of a system of piped, \ntreated  water  include  improved  accessibility,  convenience  and  reliability  of  water  supply, \nincreased  quantities  of  water  and  improved  water  quality,  and  greater  health  benefits. \nQuantifiable economic benefits of improved water supply services include (i) benefits from \nnon-incremental water consumption, valued at the weighted average supply price of water from \nnon-piped sources; (ii) incremental water consumption, valued at average demand price; and \n(iii) other resource savings. The weighted average water supply costs of existing water sources \nare estimated at KN12,103 per m3 in Namkheung, KN13,181 per m3 in Namor, KN9,117 per m3 \nin Namtha and KN11,966 per m3 in Ngoi. The average demand price is estimated at KN8,151 \nper m3 in Namkheung, KN8,465 per m3 in Namor, KN6,208 per m3 in Namtha and KN6,958 per \nm3 in Ngoi. Health benefits, likely to occur provided that the adverse health impact of an \nincreased volume of wastewater can be minimized, have not been quantified and included in the \nanalysis due to lack of reliable data. \n \n12.  The  urban  environmental  improvement  component  will  significantly  improve  the \nenvironmental and living conditions and public health in the subproject areas. The improvement \nin the environment may be reflected in the amounts people are willing to pay for property either \nin terms of rent or the purchase price of the property in the subproject areas. In Namkheung, \nNamor, Namtha, and Ngoi subproject areas, existing land values amount to KN50,000 per m2, \nKN90,000 per m2, KN80,000 per m2, and KN70,000 per m2, respectively, as provided by their \nrespective town officials. The respective town officials estimate that the increase in land value \nas a result of the subprojects would be about 25%. \n \n  5.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n13.  The results of the economic internal rate of return calculation of the subprojects, as \nshown  below,  are  well  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  It  can  be \nconcluded that the proposed subprojects are economically viable under the base case scenario \nand also under adverse changes in conditions, except in some cases. The adverse changes \nanalyzed were: (i) a capital cost overrun of 10%, (ii) a 10% increase in the O&M cost, (iii) a 10% \nreduction in the benefits, and (iv) a year\u2019s delay in the subproject benefits. The sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the proposed subprojects are most sensitive to delay in subproject \nbenefits, but remain well above the economic opportunity cost of capital except in Namkheung. \n \n ", "60   Appendix 10 \n \nTable A10.2: EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n    Namkheung  Namor  Namtha  Ngoi \nKey Variable  Change  EIRR  SIa  SVb  EIRR  SI  SV  EIRR  SI  SV  EIRR  SI  SV \nWater Supply \nBase case    21.9%      20.1%      26.0%      19.0%     \nCapitalcCost  +10%  19.9%  2.0  50%  18.3%  2.3    43%  23.9%  1.5  67%  17.2%  2.5    39% \nO&M cost  +10%  21.6%  0.3  294%  19.9%  0.3  312%  25.6%  0.3  340%  18.7%  0.5  217% \nBenefits  -10%  19.4%  2.6  39%  17.8%  2.9    35%  23.3%  1.9  52%  16.7%  3.3    31% \nBenefits Delay  1 Year  17.9%      16.7%      21.2%      15.8%     \nUrban Environmental Improvement \nBase case    13.3%      18.6%      22.5%      18.4%     \nCapital cost  +10%  12.2%    8.7  11%  17.1%  2.3    44%  20.8%  1.6  61%  16.9%  2.3    43% \nO&M cost  +10%  12.9%    3.1  33%  18.2%  0.6  165%  22.1%  0.4  260%  18.0%  0.6  160% \nBenefits  -10%  11.6%  12.7     8%  16.5%  3.1    32%  20.2%  2.2  46%  16.4%  3.2    32% \nBenefits delay  1 Year  11.3%      15.6%      18.7%      15.5%     \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \na  SI (ratio of % change in EIRR above the cut-off rate of 12% to % change in a variable). \nb  SV (% change in a variable to reduce the EIRR to the cut-off rate of 12%). \nSource: ADB. 2005.
