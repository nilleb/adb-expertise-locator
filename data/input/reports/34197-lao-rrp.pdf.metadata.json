The \nproject  will  improve  the  quality  of  the  environment  and  the  living \nstandards  of  communities  in  small  towns  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The \nexpected  benefits  include  availability  of  house-connected  clean \nand reliable water supply for drinking and sanitation, minimized or \neliminated  flooding  and  stagnation  of  wastewater,  and  improved \npersonal  sanitation.  The  results  of  the  initial  environmental \nexaminations  indicate  that  the  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  cause \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  associated  with  the  design,  construction, \nand  operation  of  the subprojects  will  be  mostly  of  low  magnitude \nand  localized,  and  can  be  readily  mitigated  through  proper \nengineering  design  and  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures \ninitial  environmental \nexaminations. \n \nThe  project  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  residents  in  small \ntowns  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  make  the  small  towns  better  able  to \nfunction  as  market,  services,  and  manufacturing  centers \nsupporting  the  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy \n(NGPES 2004), which is aimed at reducing poverty through strong \neconomic growth and increased emphasis on the poorest districts. \n \nThe  outcomes  of  the  project  will  be  (i) improved  access,  quality, \nreliability,  and  sustainability  of  water  supply  services  in  about  12 \nsmall towns in the northern and central regions of the country; and \n(ii) improved  living  conditions  in  the  small  towns  through  urban \nand village environmental improvements.  \n \nResidents  in  small  towns  in  the  Lao  PDR  spend  considerable \ntime,  energy,  and  financial  resources  getting  water  for  their  daily \nneeds.  Low  coverage  of  safe  piped  water  supply,  poor \nenvironmental  conditions,  and  low  hygiene  awareness  in  small \ntowns  have  resulted  in  a  high  incidence  of  diarrhea  and  malaria, \nand  high  morbidity.  Such  unfavorable  conditions  also  constrain \nthe small towns\u2019 economic development and their ability to serve \nthe  surrounding  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  supports  water \nsupply  and  associated  urban  improvement  in  small  towns,  the \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nthe  Central  Region.  The  project \n\ngovernment\u2019s  highest  priorities  in  small  town  development.  The \ngeographic  focus  of  the  project  is  the  poor  Northern  Region,  in \nline with the geographic focus of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \noperations,  and \nincludes \nsignificant  community  participation,  poverty  reduction,  and  health \nand hygiene promotion activities to strengthen local ownership of \nthe  project  facilities  and  maximize  the  intended  health  benefits \nand poverty reduction impact. \n \nThe  project  implementation  follows  a  phased  approach,  with \nphase 1  covering  three  towns,  phase 2  five  towns,  and  phase 3 \nfour  towns.  Supplementary  financing  is  required  to  finance  the \nprojected outputs in four phase 3 towns, which cannot be covered \nby  the  original  budget  because  of  cost  increases  in  the  phase 1 \nand  2  towns.  The  costs  have  increased  because  (i) larger \npopulations  will  be  served  by \ninfrastructure,  given  a \nhigher-than-assumed  growth  rate  and  a  revised  design  horizon; \nand (ii) increased per capita water demand has increased. \n\nthe \n\nThe  project  implementation  progress  is  found  to  be  satisfactory \nand  it  is  expected  that  the  supplementary  financing  will  heighten \nthe project\u2019s impact by improving the quality of life of an additional \n44,000  residents  in  the  four  target  towns  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The \nproposed project towns were selected according to the subproject \nselection criteria agreed on under the project.  \n \nThe project\u2019s impact will be a better quality of life for residents in \nsmall  towns  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  increased  capacity  of  small \ntowns to function as market, services, and manufacturing centers \nsupporting  the  rural  hinterlands.  The  outcomes  of  the  project  will \nbe  (i) more  accessible,  better-quality,  reliable,  and  sustainable \nwater supply services; and (ii) improved environmental conditions \nin  the  small  towns.  These  outcomes  will  be  achieved  through \n(i) the construction of new water supply systems using appropriate \ntechnologies;  (ii) the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  selected \nurban  facilities,  i.e.,  sanitation,  drainage,  roads,  and  bridges; \n(iii) the  promotion  of  public  hygiene  awareness  and  public \nparticipation \nand \n(iv) the strengthening  of  sector  capacity  to  plan,  manage,  and \nregulate water supply and sanitation facilities and services. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $32.1  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.7 million.  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  supplementary  grant  of \n$6.6 million  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  resources.  The \ngovernment will finance the taxes and duties and the resettlement \ncosts.  Asian  Development  Fund  grant  financing  for  the  project  is \njustified:  (i) the  sector\u2019s  investment  demand  is  huge  but  the \ngovernment  is  in  a  very  difficult  fiscal  situation,  (ii) water  supply \nand  sanitation  are  basic  human  needs,  (iii) the  project  will \n\nimprovement \n\ninitiatives; \n\nvillage \n\nin \n\n\f(v) the  government \n\ncontribute  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals, \n(iv) the  project  has  potential  for  significant  poverty  reduction \nimpact,  and \nto \ndeveloping the sector. \n \nThe financing plan is summarized in the table. \n \n\nis  strongly  committed \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nSource \nADB  \nOFID \nNORAD \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n \n\nTotal \n\nPhase 1 and \n2 Towns \n9.80 \n8.15 \n2.55 \n3.15 \n0.06 \n23.71 \n\nPhase 3 \nTowns \n6.80a \n0.84 \n \n0.76 \n0.03 \n8.43 \n\nPhase 1, 2, \nand 3 \nTowns \n16.60 \n8.99 \n2.55 \n3.91 \n0.09 \n32.14 \n\n \n\n% \n51.6\n28.0\n7.9\n12.2\n0.3\n100.0\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NORAD  =  Norwegian  Agency \nfor \nDevelopment Cooperation, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development. \na  Financed  from  ADB.  2005.

International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated \nto  cost  over  $1.0  million,  and  for  supply  contracts  valued  at  over \n$500,000.  Procurement  of  civil  works  valued  at  less  than  $1.0 \nmillion equivalent will be undertaken through national competitive \nbidding.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  materials  and \nequipment  packages  or  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$100,000  equivalent.  ADB  shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for \nthe small village civil works and supply contracts.  \n \nADB's  management  has  approved  advance  procurement  of  civil \nworks.  The  government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nadvance procurement  does not commit ADB to finance the project, \nand that the  procurement  should  be carried out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \n \nthe  supplementary \nNo  consultants  will  be  recruited  under \nfinancing  agreement.

The \nhealth  benefits  will  come  from  (i) a  safe  and  convenient  water \nsupply;  (ii) improved  environmental  sanitation  through  drainage \nand  related  works;  (iii) increased  use  of  domestic  sanitation \nfacilities  due  to  increased  awareness,  appropriate  sanitation \nmodels, and improved water supply; (iv) increased knowledge and \nawareness  of  health  and  hygiene  issues;  and  (v) avoidance  of \ndrudgery  associated  with  collecting  water.  The  health  benefits \nfrom physical investments under the project will be complemented \n\nrequired  project \n\n\fby  the  hygiene  awareness  and  promotion  activities.  The  core \nvillages in the four project towns will benefit directly from improved \naccess  roads,  footpaths,  drainage,  and  sanitation  in  residential \nareas. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from greater productivity \nas  a  result  of  health  improvement,  time  savings  in  collecting \nwater,  and  increased  urban  efficiency  arising  from  improved \nroads,  bridges,  drainage,  and  sanitation.  Residents  in  towns  will \nalso  benefit \nin \nlower  water  costs  and \nhealth-care costs. \n \nThe  risks  identified  under  the  original  project  have  substantially \nbeen mitigated through project activities and safeguard measures. \n\nfrom  savings \n\nfrom \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern and \nCentral Regions Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \nThe  Northern  and  Central  Regions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project1 was \n2. \napproved on 25 August 2005 for an amount of $24.9 million equivalent, of which $10 million was \nto be financed with a grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This grant took effect on \n14 June 2006 and the activities began in November 2006. The approved project is scheduled to \nbe completed in March 2010 and the initial grant to be closed in September 2010. \n \nA. \n \nThe government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES 2004) is \n3. \naimed  at  reducing  poverty  through  strong  economic  growth  and  increased  emphasis  on  the \npoorest  districts.  It  is  focused  on  health,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  as  one  of  four \npriority  sectors  for  poverty  reduction.  Having  been  neglected  in  past  investments,  small  towns \nwith  populations  ranging  from  2,000  to  20,000  remain  underdeveloped\u2014overall  piped  water \nsupply  service  coverage  is  only  about  17%,  compared  with  69%  in  Vientiane  and  the  four \nlargest secondary towns. More than 50% of households do not have any form of water-sealed \ntoilets,  and  less  than  10%  of  primary  schools  have  latrines.  Roads  have  mainly  gravel  or  dirt \npavements, with low coverage of roadside drains. Residents in small towns spend considerable \ntime, energy, and financial resources getting water for their daily needs. Low coverage of safe \npiped water supply, poor environmental conditions, and low hygiene awareness in small towns \nhave resulted in a high incidence of diarrhea and malaria, and high morbidity. Such unfavorable \nconditions also constrain the small towns\u2019 economic development and their ability to serve the \nsurrounding  rural  hinterlands.  The  project  supports  water  supply  and  associated  urban \nimprovement in small towns, the government\u2019s highest priorities in small town development. The \ngeographic focus of the project is the poor Northern Region, in line with the geographic focus of \nADB  operations,  and  the  Central  Region.  The  project  includes  significant  community \nparticipation, poverty reduction, and health and hygiene promotion activities to strengthen local \nownership  of  the  facilities  and  maximize  the  intended  health  benefits  and  poverty  reduction \nimpact. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  better  quality  of  life  for  residents  in  small  towns  in  the \nLao PDR  and  the  improved  capacity  of  small  towns  to  function  as  market,  services,  and \nmanufacturing  centers  supporting  the  rural  hinterlands.  The  outcomes  of  the  project  will  be \n(i) improved  access,  quality,  reliability,  and  sustainability  of  water  supply  services  in  about  12 \nsmall  towns  in  the  Northern  and  Central  regions  of  the  country;  and  (ii) improved  living \nconditions  in  the  small  towns  through  urban  and  village  environmental  improvements.  The \nobjectives will be achieved through (i) the constructing new optimal-size water supply systems \nusing appropriate technologies; (ii) the rehabilitation or improvement of selected urban facilities, \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The delay occurred mainly at the start of the project and was due \nto  delay  in  grant  effectiveness  and  in  the  recruitment  of  consultants. 5 The  progress  of  the \nconstruction works generally follows the planned schedule. \n \n8. \nThe project is formulated as a sector project, and will have five outputs: (i) strengthened \nregulation and management of the water supply sector; (ii) water supply development; (iii) urban \nenvironmental  improvements;  (iv) participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions;  and \n(v) project  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.  The  implementation  follows  a \nphased  approach,  with  phase  1  covering  three  towns,  phase  2  five  towns,  and  phase  3  four \ntowns.6 The progress for each output is summarized below. \n \n\nOutput 1: Strengthened Water Supply Sector Regulation and Management \n\n2. \n \n9. \nThe  activities  are  focused  on  strengthening  the  position  of  the  water  supply  regulatory \ncommittee7 (WSRC) as regulatory authority and strengthening the capacity of the water supply \ndivision of MPWT to plan water supply investments and to guide the operation and maintenance \nof infrastructure. \n \n10. \nAs  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  continuing  policy  dialogue  with  the  government,  the  scope  of  this \noutput  was  extended  in  2008  to  include  the  corporatization  of  four  PNPs:  Luangprabang, \nLouang-Namtha,  Oudomxai,  and  Xaignabouli.  The  corporatization  was  expected  to  transform \nthe  public  PNPs  into  more  efficient,  commercially  oriented,  and  autonomous  water  supply \ncompanies.  The  project  supports  the  development  of  the  PNPs\u2019  capacity  for  business  and \nfinancial management, commercial orientation, and operating efficiency.  \n \n11. \nIn February 2009, ADB approved the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject,8 which included other activities to further strengthen the sector, such as establishing the \nWSRC  as  a  sustainable  independent  agency,  updating  the  water  sector  investment  plan,  and \n                                                 \n5  Due to delay in government approval of recruitment. \n6  The project as originally  designed involved the implementation of 12 subprojects in two phases only. The design \nwas revised during inception. Implementation began in the first three towns for which feasibility studies were ready, \nand was to be done in two phases in the remaining nine towns.  \n\n7  Formerly Water Supply Authority. \n8  ADB.  2009.

A special characteristic of this project is the requirement for a \nmemorandum of agreement (MOA) to be signed by the office of the provincial governor (OPG) \nand  the  PNP.  The  MOA  will  help  the  corporatization  of  the  PNPs  by  describing  working \narrangements,  performance  indicators  and  targets,  delegation  of  authority  for  tariffs,  and \nmanagement. It will set tariffs at levels that will enable PNPs to recover the costs of operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M),  debt  servicing,  and  gradually  increasing  depreciation.  It  will  also \ninclude  minimum  service  level  targets,  regulatory  reporting  and  funding  arrangements,  and \npossibly an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism. \n \n12. \nProgress.  This  output  addresses  the  specific  lessons  learned  from  the  Water  Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Project,9 which was closed in 2007: lack of effective sector coordination \nand  regulation;  no  obligation  on  the  part  of  PNPs  to  increase  water  tariffs,  leading  to  lack  of \nfinancial  sustainability  of  PNPs;  and  low  awareness  of  PNPs  and  the  provincial  governors  of \ntheir obligations under the loan agreement.  \n \n13. \n  \n\nSatisfactory progress has been made in addressing these issues: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIn June 2009, the National Assembly passed the new water law, which includes \nnew  guidelines  on  water  tariff  setting  and  lays  down  basic  principles  and \nmeasures, including regulation, for water supply management. This law will guide \nofficials  in  planning,  designing,  building,  managing,  and  using  water  supply \nfacilities effectively.  \nTariffs are being adjusted in accordance with the cost recovery principles laid out \nin the grant agreement, and tariffs were increased on 1 April 2009.10 Although the \nPNPs  have  not  yet  formally  reported  any  financial  performance  data, 11 some \nPNPs  have  reported  positive  cash  flow  returns  and  are  preparing  investment \nprograms financed with their internally generated income. \nAll  but  one  PNP  have  signed  the  MOA,  which  basically  allows  the  PNP  to \noperate the government-owned assets following enterprise law and sets out the \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  the  PNP  and  the  OPG.  Specific  subsidiary  loan \nagreements  are  signed  by  PNPs  and  Ministry  of  Finance.  Of  the  four  phase 3 \ntowns,  only  the  MOA  for  Nam  Keung  in  Bokeo  province  still  has  to  be  signed. \nThe signing of the MOA is a condition for disbursement. \nFour  of  the  PNPs  have  submitted  corporate  plans,  of  which  two  have  been \ntranslated and are being reviewed by the project consultants. Furthermore, they \nhave adopted an arrears collection strategy and allocated sufficient staff training \nbudgets, and they maintain a depreciation account. \n\n \n14. \nAlthough  the  water  supply  regulatory  committee  (WSRC)  has  been  established,  the \nfinancing  mechanism  of  this  agency12 is  still  under  consideration  by  the  government.  Approval \nwas  delayed  by  the  reorganization  of  the  regulatory  agency  and  the  proposal  of  a  new  water \nlaw. ADB will follow up the approval of the financing mechanism through continuous dialogue. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2008.

Some PNPs already include the full depreciation costs. \n11 The fiscal year ends in September.  \n12 The approval of the WSRC\u2019s funding plan and the raising of water surcharges to finance WSRC, within 36 months \n\nof grant effectiveness, is covenanted in the grant agreement for grant 0016. \n\n\fThe  activities  under  this  output  are  supported  by  NORAD  under  a  parallel  cofinancing \n15. \nagreement. In 2007 NORAD agreed to extend their support and increased their grant to $2.55 \nmillion.  \n \n\nOutput 2: Water Supply Development \n\n3. \n \n16. \nThis output is focused on the development of safe, affordable, and reliable piped water \nsupply  systems  for  about  100,000  residents  in  12  project  towns  by  2015.  It  includes  the \ndevelopment  of  (i) surface,  spring,  or  groundwater  sources;  (ii) raw  water  transmission \npipelines;  (iii) water  treatment  facilities;  (iv) distribution  networks;  (v) treated-water  reservoirs; \n(vi) individual  metered  service  connections;  and  (vii) an  office/workshop/store  for  each  PNP \nbranch. It covers the procurement of equipment for O&M of the water supply systems. \n \n17. \nProgress.  Works  in  phase  1  towns  were  completed  in  October  2009  and  the  works  in \nphase 2 towns are under construction, to be completed by August 2010. Detailed designs are \nbeing prepared for the phase 3 towns. \n \n18. \nThe  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (footnote  4)  also  showed  that  high \nconnection charges up-front lead to low connection rates. Although the project design provided \nfor  deferred  payment,  at  inception  it  was  agreed  that  all  up-front  charges  would  be  scrapped \nand connection costs would be charged through the depreciation component of the water tariffs. \nThis  policy  has  led  to  uptakes  of  about  92%  on  average,  substantially  increasing  the  revenue \nstream and improving the financial performance of the PNPs.  \n \n\nOutput 3: Urban Environmental Improvements \n\n4. \n \n19. \nThis  output  is  focused  on  the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  small  urban \ninfrastructure  directly  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  water  supply \nsystems,  including  public  sanitation  facilities,  drainage,  roads,  and  culverts.  It  covers  the \nprocurement of equipment for O&M of the rehabilitated or improved urban facilities. \n \n20. \nProgress. Works in phase 1 towns were to be completed by December 2009. Works in \nphase  2  towns  have  been  designed  but  have  not  yet  been  tendered,  while  works  in  phase  3 \ntowns are under preparation.  \n \n\nOutput 4: Participation, Awareness, and Community Actions \n\n5. \n \n21. \nThis  output  has  two  subcomponents:  (i) a  community  health  and  awareness  program \n(CHAP), and (ii) village environmental improvements (VEIs). The CHAP is aimed at improving \ncommunity  awareness  of  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  informing  communities  about  the \nproject  activities;  motivating  households  to  connect  to  the  piped  water  supply  system  and \nimprove their toilet facilities; and helping communities plan, design, operate, and maintain local \nurban  services  in  partnership  with  local  agencies.  The  VEIs  provide  funds  and  technical \nassistance  for  small-scale  improvements  in  core  village  residential  areas.  They  include: \n(i) community  environmental  improvements,  such  as  access  roads,  footpaths,  paved  public \nareas,  tertiary  drains,  drainage  covers,  and  improved  public  sanitation;  and  (ii) grants  to  poor \nfamilies for the construction or upgrading of toilets and sanitation facilities. \n \nProgress.  Workshops  have  been  carried  out  and  institutional  frameworks  have  been \n22. \nestablished in all 12 project towns. The community mobilization activities have been carried out \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fin phase 1 and 2 towns, while physical construction has been completed in phase 1 towns. In \nphase 2 towns the works are being tendered. \n \n23. \nIn all 12 towns there is a strong desire on the part of the communities to participate in \nproject  implementation.  Community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation  units  and  community \naction teams have been established and are actively supporting project implementation. About \n32% of the elected officers are women. CHAP implementation is about 6% completed in the 12 \ntowns. \n \n24. \nThe  project  provides  grants  of  $75  to  poor  households  for  the  construction  of  latrines. \nPoor  households  are  identified  through  poverty  mapping  and  social  surveys.  The  project \nprocures goods under one contract for each town, and the community provides the labor. The \nnonpoor  households  build  their  latrines  individually.  The  original  design  included  a  community \nawareness campaign,  after  which  communities  would  be  motivated  to  build  latrines.  However, \nthe initial results were poor, and latrine construction was made a condition for the availability of \nfree house connections. Consequently, the coverage improved by about 50%, to 85%\u201395%.  \n \n\nOutput 5: Project Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building \n\n6. \n \n25. \nThis  output  involves  assisting  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  and  each  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  with  project  implementation.  The  capacity-building  program  will  help \nto  develop  more  efficient  institutions  in  the  towns  to  manage  urban  services  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. \n \nProgress.  The  project  implementation  assistance  is  ongoing,  while  capacity  building \n26. \ntraining and workshops have been completed, with representatives of all 12 subproject towns in \nattendance. \n \n\nCompliance with Grant Covenants \n\n7. \n \n\n27.  Most  of  the  grant  covenants  have  been  complied  with.  The  financial  covenants  on \ncollection  of  government  arrears  and  the  establishment  of  a  tariff  surcharge  to  finance  the \noperating  cost  of  the  WSRC  (para.  14)  have  not  yet  been  complied  with.  The  collection  of \narrears in payments from government agencies to the PNPs remains an issue that needs to be \naddressed through concrete measures, such as direct payment of government agencies\u2019 water \nbills by the provincial treasury. The MOA signed by PNP and OPG includes targets, timelines, \nand measures to be taken. The establishment of a tariff surcharge to finance the operating cost \nof WSRC was delayed (para. 14). A detailed overview of compliance with grant covenants is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nProposed Incremental Activities \n\n \nA. \n \nBecause of the increased budget requirement for the phase 1 and 2 towns, the phase 3 \n28. \ntowns cannot be financed under the original budget. The current proposal is to finance the four \ntowns in phase 3 through a supplementary grant agreement. \n \nThe budget requirement has increased because (i) larger populations will be served by \n29. \nthe infrastructure, given the higher-than-assumed growth rate and the delayed design horizon, \nand (ii) per capita water demand has increased. Both the larger design population and the larger \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fconsumption  rates  have  led  to  the  construction  of  larger  treatment  systems,  longer  pipelines, \nand  more  house  connections.  These  additional  works  have  increased  the  investment \nrequirements for the phase 1 and 2 towns. The original project budget is sufficient to cover the \nphase 1 and 2 towns, but the water supply and sanitation investments in the phase 3 towns will \nrequire supplementary financing.  \n \n30. \nIncrease in population served. At appraisal in 2005 a design horizon of 15 years was \ndecided  on.  The  12  towns  were  expected  to  have  a  total  population  of  89,000  in  2010,  and \nabout 115,000 in 2020. The actual population growth, however, has been higher than expected. \nThe projected population of the 12 towns is now estimated to be 99,000 in 2010 and 130,000 in \n2010.  Since  the  appraisal  was  done  in  2005  but  the  actual  designs  were  made  in  2008  and \n2009,  the  design  horizon  chosen  was  2027,  rather  than  2020.  The  total  projected  design \npopulation  of  all  12  towns  is  about 160,000.  The  project  budget  will  cover  only  about  115,000 \npeople, equal to the projected population of the eight phase 1 and 2 towns in 2025.  \n \n31. \nIncrease  in  per  capita  consumption.  The  per  capita  consumption  at  appraisal  was \nestimated to be constant at 85 liters per capita per day. During the detailed design, however, a \nmore realistic approach was chosen and an increase in per capita consumption was assumed, \non the basis of a 5% growth in gross domestic product and demand elasticity of 0.2\u20130.3, leading \nto per capita consumption varying from 115 to 120 liters per capita per day by 2025. \n \n32. \nRequired  budget.  As  of  November  2009,  the  contracted  works  were  valued  at \n$15.7 million. It is expected that $2.3 million more will be needed to complete all works for the \neight phase 1 and 2 towns. This will leave a balance of $1.0 million ($0.2 million ADB grant and \n$0.8 million OFID loan).

Proposed Grant Assistance to Lao People's Democratic Republic for the Northern and Central \nRegions Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila (Grant 0016-LAO). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n33. \nIt  is  proposed  that  the  OFID  loan  be  used  to  finance  part  (following  agreed  financing \nratios)  of  the  water  supply  works  for  Namor,  and  the  ADB  grant  to  finance  the  remaining \nactivities. The government will seek OFID\u2019s approval for loan reallocation and extension of the \nloan closing date.  \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImpact on the Project \n\nThe  supplementary  financing  will  heighten  the  impact  of  the  project  by  improving  the \n\nB. \n \n34. \nquality of life of an additional 44,000 small-town residents in the Lao PDR.  \n \n35. \nThe supplementary financing will result in improved water supply services, and improved \nsanitation, including drainage, in the project towns: Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi. The \nimprovements will be involve (i) providing 24-hour piped water supply to about 44,000 residents \nin the core villages of four target towns upon commissioning; (ii) improving roads, culverts, and \nroadside  drainage  over  a  total  length  of  about  4  kilometers;  and  (iii) increasing  the  average \nsanitation coverage in target communities to 65% of households in 2017. The proposed project \ntowns were selected following the subproject selection criteria agreed on under the project. \n \n36. \n \n\nThe proposed supplementary grant will support the following three outputs: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nNew  water  supply  systems. New water supply systems will be built in each of \nthe four phase 3 project towns. \nImproved  roads,  culverts,  drainage,  and  sanitation.  In  each  of  the  four \nphase 3 project towns priority roads, culverts, and associated roadside drains will \nbe built or improved, while public sanitation facilities at markets, bus stations, and \nschools will be improved. \nVillage  environmental  improvements.  Funds  and  technical  assistance  will  be \nprovided \nin  core  village  residential  areas: \n(a) community  environmental  improvements,  such  as  access  roads,  footpaths, \npaved  public  areas,  tertiary  drains,  drainage  covers,  and  improved  public \nsanitation;  and  (b) grants  to  poor  families  for  the  construction  or  upgrading  of \ntoilets and sanitation facilities. \n\nfor  small-scale \n\nimprovements \n\n \nRationale \n\nC. \n \n37. \nThe  proposal  to  provide  supplementary  financing  is  justified  since  it  complements  the \nongoing  initiatives  in  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  specifically \nincreases  the  impact,  outcome,  and  development  effectiveness  of  the  Northern  and  Central \nRegions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.  This  project  has  made  satisfactory \nprogress with regard to sector reform and infrastructure development, and is likely to achieve its \nexpected outcome.  \n \n38. \nFor  each  of  the  four  project  towns  full  feasibility  studies  have  been  prepared \ndemonstrating the technical feasibility and economic viability of the investments. The technical \ndesigns are similar to the designs of the original project towns leading to uniform operation and \nmanagement requirements. The subprojects have been found to be efficient and affordable to \nthe beneficiaries. The per capita investments costs vary from $100 to $190 for the four project \ntowns,  similar  to  the  $70\u2013$180  per  capita  investment  costs  for  the  original  project  towns.  The \nrequired water tariffs are in line with the WSRC-recommended tariffs. \n \n39. \nIn  addition,  the  proposed  supplementary  financing  complies  with  the  following  criteria: \n(i) supplementary financing may be provided no more than twice to the original operation; (ii) the \naggregate  amounts  of  the  supplementary  financing  should  not  exceed  the  original  financing \napproved by ADB; and (iii) the proposed activities should be completed within a reasonable time \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nafter  the  current  closing  date  for  the  original  project,  which  generally  should  not  exceed \n3 years.13 \n \nD. \n \n40. \nLand acquisition and resettlement. The subprojects have limited adverse impact from \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR),  in  accordance  with  the  project\u2019s  category B \nclassification.  Short  resettlement  plans  following  the  resettlement  framework  developed  under \nthe  original  project  have  been  prepared  and  are  included  in  the  feasibility  studies  on  the \nsubprojects  (Supplementary  Appendixes  A\u2013D).  These  resettlement  plans  will  be  reviewed  by \nADB and must be approved before the civil works contracts are awarded.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental \n41. \nassessment  guidelines.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  and  an \nenvironmental assessment framework was drawn up for the project during its preparation, and \nwere  also  approved  by  the  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Agency.  As  part  of  the \npreparation  work  for  the  supplementary  grant,  IEEs  were  prepared  for  the  project  towns  of \nNamkeung,  Namor,  Namtha,  and  Ngoi  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) and with the Environmental Protection Law (1999) of the Government of the \nLao  PDR  and  its  Implementing  Decree  (2002)  and  Regulation  on  Environmental  Assessment \n(2000). These IEEs confirm the category B classification. The IEEs are included in the appraisal \nreports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D) and will be reviewed by ADB. The \nIEEs will have to be approved before the civil works contracts are awarded. \n \nEthnic groups. The subprojects will benefit the ethnic groups directly. It has been found \n42. \nthat the water supply and sanitation needs of the various ethnic groups in the subproject areas \ndo  not  differ.  Specific  actions  to  increase  project  benefits  or  mitigate  adverse  project  impact \namong some ethnic groups have been included in the social strategies and short resettlement \nplans for the four subprojects. \n \nE. \n \nThe  investment  costs  for  the  phase  1  and  2  towns  combined  is  estimated  to  be \n43. \n$23.7 million,  while  the  cost  for  the  phase  3  towns  is  about  $8.4  million,  bringing  the  total \ninvestment costs to $32.1 million, including taxes and duties of $2.7 million (Table 4).  \n \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\nTable 4: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  government  will  finance  the \ntaxes  and  duties  and  the  resettlement  costs.  ADF  grant  financing  for  the  project  is  justified: \n(i) the  sector\u2019s  investment  demand  is  huge,  but  the  government  is  in  a  very  difficult  fiscal \nsituation;  (ii) water  supply  and  sanitation  are  basic  human  needs;  (iii) the  project  will  help \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals; (iv) the project has potential for significant poverty \nreduction  impact;  and  (v) the  government  is  strongly  committed  to  developing  the  sector.

The subsidiary loan will have an interest \nrate of 6.4% and a maturity period of 25 years, including a 6-year grace period. The balance\u2014\n70%  of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply  schemes\u2014and  the  costs  for  the  other  activities  will  be \nfinanced with a grant from the government.  \n \n46.  With  this  supplementary  financing,  ADB\u2019s  financing  share  of  the  total  project  costs  will \nincrease  from  40%  at  appraisal  to  52%.  A  detailed  breakdown  of  cost  per  financier  for  the \nproject, with and without the supplementary financing, is in Appendix 3. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fframework; \n\n(vi) supervise \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nG. \n \n47. \nProject  management.  This  will  follow  the  current  arrangements.  MPWT  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  and  the  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  existing  PCU  will  (i) supervise  overall  project  implementation, \nprogramming, budgeting, and financial planning and accounting; (ii) provide administrative and \ntechnical support to the PIUs; (iii) prepare consolidated project progress reports and the project \ncompletion report; and (iv) consolidate the project accounting, auditing, and monitoring reports \nfor submission to ADB. A PIU will be established in each implementing agency to take charge of \nday-to-day  project  implementation.  It  will  (i) participate  in  project  planning,  feasibility  studies, \ndesign, and procurement activities for the subproject in the province; (ii) coordinate the activities \nof  consultants  and  contractors  in  the  province;  (iii) oversee  construction;  (iv) coordinate \nresettlement and assist the resettlement committee; (v) implement the gender strategy and the \nethnic  groups  development \nlocal  capacity-building  activities; \n(vii) prepare  the  subproject  accounting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  reports;  and  (viii) manage \nactivities  under  output  4  (participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions),  including \nprocurement. Mass organizations, such as the Lao Women\u2019s Union, will be members of the PIU, \nand will help implement the project.  \n \nThe  supplementary  works  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  its  development \n48. \npartners,  which  are  directly  involved  in  financing  of  the  project,  following  the  established \nprocedures. Detailed information on development coordination is in Appendix 4.  \n \nImplementation period. The project will be extended for 2 years until March 2012, with \n49. \na grant closing date of September 2012. This proposed extension is feasible since consultants \nare  already  in  the  field  and  design  documents  have  been  prepared  for  the  subprojects  and \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n50.   Advance  action.  ADB's management has approved advance procurement of civil works. \nThe government has been advised that approval of the advance procurement does not commit ADB \nto  finance  the  project,  and  that  the  procurement  should  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n51. \nProcurement.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant and the OFID loan \nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  for  major  civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost over $1.0 million. The procurement of civil works valued at less than \n$1.0 million  equivalent  will  be  undertaken  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Shopping \nprocedures will be followed for small village civil works and supply contracts costing less than \n$100,000 equivalent. Water meters will be purchased according to a limited international bidding \nprocedure,  following  the  successfully  completed  earlier  purchase  of  water  meters.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nConsulting  services.  No  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  supplementary \n52. \nfinancing  agreement.  The  current  project  implementation  assistance  contract  will  be  extended \nfor the required project implementation assistance. \n \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n53. \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MPWT. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fdirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPWT  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n54. \nDisbursement arrangements. Eligible expenditures will be paid from grant proceeds in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand  following  the  established  procedures.  The  Government  opened  a  project  imprest  account \nafter Grant 0016 took effect, and the PCU opened a second-generation imprest account (SGIA). \nEach  PIU  has  opened  or  will  open  an  SGIA  in  dollars  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to \nADB  and  other  cofinanciers,  after  the  respective  subprojects  are  approved.  The  amount  to  be \ndeposited into each SGIA will be based on the first 6 months\u2019 projected expenditure of the PIU, \nbut  will  not  exceed  $25,000.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used \nwhen  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The \nmaximum payment for any individual items using the SOE is $20,000 equivalent. \n \n55. \nGrant  proceeds  will  not be  disbursed  to  a  participating  province  if  misprocurement  has \nbeen found by ADB or procurement has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement or \nother  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  province  concerned  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \ngovernment and ADB. \n \n56. \nAccounting, auditing, and reporting. Following the established procedures, each PIU \nwill prepare quarterly project progress reports in a short, standardized format acceptable to all \nfinanciers,  and  submit  them  to  the  PCU  for  consolidation  and  submission  to  ADB  and  other \ncofinanciers.  The  reports  will  be  in  such  form  and  detail  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  other \ncofinanciers.  Each  PNP  will  prepare  its  annual  financial  statements,  including  the  (i) balance \nsheet, (ii) income statement, and (iii) cash flow statement. The project and subproject accounts, \nincluding the imprest account, SOE, and financial statements of the PNPs, will be audited each \nyear by auditors acceptable to ADB and other cofinanciers. The PCU and PIUs will prepare the \nrequired  information  for  audit,  including  information  on  resettlement  implementation,  in \naccordance with project auditing requirements of the government, ADB, and other cofinanciers. \nAudited  statements  of  project  and  subproject  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  PNPs, \ntogether  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  through  the  PCU  within \n6 months of the close of the fiscal year. \n \n57. \nProject  performance  management  and  evaluation.  The  project  performance \nmanagement  and  evaluation  (PPME)  system  will  follow  the  PPME  that  was  set  up  under  the \nproject and is now being used by MPWT in monitoring and evaluating project performance. The \nPPME specifically (i) examines the project\u2019s technical performance; (ii) evaluates the delivery of \nthe planned facilities; (iii) assesses achievement of the project objectives; and (iv) measures the \nproject\u2019s social, economic, financial, and institutional impact. At the start of the project, the PCU \nand the PIUs developed a set of PPME indicators. The socioeconomic data are disaggregated \nby  income  group,  gender,  and  ethnic  group,  as  appropriate.  The  PIUs  are  responsible  for \ncarrying  out \nincluding  pre-project  and  post-project  physical  and \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  and  data  collection  and  analysis.  Each  PIU  will  establish  a  PPME \nbaseline based on the pre-project surveys and data. Annual PPME reports will be prepared by \neach PIU, and consolidated by the PCU for submission to ADB. \n \n\nthe  PPME  activities, \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n58. \nSocioeconomic  benefits.  The  supplementary  financing  will  benefit  about  44,000 \nresidents (by 2027) in the towns Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi, by providing safe and \nreliable  piped  water  supply  and  urban  environmental  improvements  that  will  have  a  direct \nimpact on the health and lives of the people in the town communities. The health benefits will \ncome from (i)  safe and convenient water supply; (ii) improved environmental sanitation through \ndrainage and related works; (iii) increased use of domestic sanitation facilities due to increased \nimproved  water  supply;  (iv) increased \nawareness,  appropriate  sanitation  models,  and \nknowledge  and  awareness  of  health  and  hygiene  issues;  and  (v) avoidance  of  the  drudgery \nassociated  with  collecting  water.  The  health  benefits  from  the  physical  investments  will  be \ncomplemented by the hygiene awareness and promotion activities. The core villages in the four \nproject  towns  will  benefit  directly  from  VEIs,  providing  access  roads,  footpaths,  and  improved \ndrainage and sanitation in residential areas. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from enhanced \nproductivity as a result of health improvement,  time savings in collecting water, and increased \nurban  efficiency  due  to  improved  roads,  bridges,  drainage,  and  sanitation.  Residents  in  towns \nwill also benefit from lower water costs and from savings in health-care costs. \n \n59. \nA  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  appraisal  and  a  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial  strategy,  a  gender  strategy,  and  all  required  safeguard  documents,  including  a \nresettlement  framework  and  an  ethnic  groups  development  framework,  have  been  prepared. \nThese  documents  are  applicable  to  the  works  to  be  financed  by  the  proposed  supplementary \nfinancing. The poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 6.  \n \nGender  impact.  While  both  men  and  women  will  benefit  from  the  project  activities, \n60. \nwomen  will  benefit  more  in  terms  of  time  savings,  reduced  drudgery,  and  improved  family \nhealth. Women perform the bulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. \nThey are generally responsible for water collection, family hygiene and sanitation, and the care \nof sick family members. The construction of new public toilet facilities will take into consideration \nspecific gender needs, particularly the privacy needs of women. Particular attention will be given \nto involving women in employment, decision making, learning, and training activities under the \nproject. For instance, qualified women will be eligible for at least 30% of new jobs generated by \nthe  project  in  the  community  (i.e.,  O&M  of  community-based  initiatives).  A  gender  strategy  for \nthe project is in Appendix 7. \n \n61. \nLand acquisition and resettlement. The adverse impact from LAR will be insignificant. \nOnly 12 households will experience major impact;14 of these, two will need resettlement. About \n525 households will incur temporary losses, for which they will be compensated if eligible. The \nsummary  resettlement  plan  is  in  Appendix  8  and  short  resettlement  plans  are  included  in  the \nappraisal reports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n62. \nEnvironmental  impact.  In  accordance  with  the  project\u2019s  category B  environmental \nclassification (nonsensitive), IEEs have been carried out for each of the subprojects. The IEEs \nshowed  no  significant  adverse  impact.  Potential  negative  impact  will  occur  mainly  during \nconstruction  and  will  be  temporary,  minor,  and  localized  in  extent  and  can  be  mitigated  to \nacceptable  levels.  The  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  9  and  IEEs  are  included  in  the  appraisal \nreports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 Households that will experience major impact are those that will be (i) physically displaced from housing, or (ii) lose \n\nmore than 10% of their income source, or (iii) lose more than 40% of their residential structure. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and financial benefits. For the four subproject towns, the economic internal \n63. \nrate  of  return  has  been  calculated  for  the  water  supply  works  and  the  urban  environmental \nimprovement works. The economic opportunity cost of capital is 12% in real terms. The results \nshow  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  varies  from  19%  to  26%  for  the  water  supply \nworks,  and  13%  to  22%  for  the  urban  environmental  improvement  works,  making  the  works \neconomically viable. \n \n64. \nThe  financial  analysis  shows  that  the  agreed  financial  objectives  of  cost  recovery  (i.e., \nfull O&M cost and gradually increasing portion of annual depreciation) and debt service (not less \nthan 1.2 times) for the sector can be met. The attainment of the financial objectives, however, \nwill  require  tariffs  to  be  periodically  raised  in  line  with  the  Water  Supply  Authority\u2019s \nrecommendations  and  to  keep  pace  with  inflation.  The  summary  financial  and  economic \nanalysis  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  detailed  financial  and  economic  analyses  are  included  in  the \nappraisal reports on the subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes A\u2013D).  \n \n65. \nRisks.  The  main  risks  associated  with  the  additional  works  are  (i) the  limited  human \nresources  and  institutional  capacities  in  the  provinces  and  districts;  (ii) uncertainty  regarding \ntariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of  water  supply  services;  (iii) insufficient \ncommunity  participation  in  project  implementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor; \n(iv) adverse effects of resettlement on poor and vulnerable households; (v) inadequate time and \nresources for assessing raw water; and (vi) inadequate sources for O&M of project facilities.  \n \n66. \nThe  project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  those  risks.  The  measures  include \n(i) capacity  building  for  the  PIU  and  for  the  communication,  transport,  posts,  and  construction \noffices and water supply and sanitation offices, to strengthen their managerial and operational \ncapacities;  (ii) commitment  to  tariff  reforms  and  associated  assurances  by  the  respective \nprovincial  governments;  (iii) a  participation  program,  gender  strategy,  and  public  awareness \ncampaigns;  (iv) a  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  to  ensure  that  all  affected \npeople  will  at  least  maintain  or  improve  their  living  standards  after  project  completion;  and \n(v) local ownership intensified through community participation in designing, implementing, and \nmaintaining  the  facilities  and  the  provincial  government\u2019s  commitment  to  adequate  budget \nallocation for O&M.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \n\n67. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nEach  participating  PNP  will  collect  all  water  bill  arrears  in  accordance  with \narrears  collection  action  plans  and  need  to  be  agreed  on  by  the  government, \nADB,  and  each  participating  PNP  before  any  disbursement  of  funds  to  the \nrelevant  subproject.  Each  participating  PNP  will  reduce  accounts  receivable  to \nless  than  90  days  within  24  months  after  effectiveness  of  the  supplementary \ngrant,  and  will  maintain  accounts  receivable  of  less  than  90  days  thereafter. \nWhere government agency water bills are outstanding for 60 days or  more, the \ngovernment  will,  within  a  further  30  days,  allocate  to  the  PNP  special  funds \nthe \nconcerned \noutstanding accounts. \n\nits  budgetary  resources  sufficient \n\nliquidate \n\nfrom \n\nfully \n\nto \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin  conjunction  with  participating  PNPs  and \n\nFor  each  subproject,  the  relevant  PNPs  will  waive  up-front  fees  for  household \nconnections in the core project villages (domestic consumers only) in accordance \nwith  the  relevant  scheme  agreed  on  by  the  government  and  ADB.  Households \nthat receive a connection will be required to pay a monthly fee that covers water \nconsumption, turnover tax, and basic administration. \nThe  government  will  provide  funds  for  sanitation  improvements  as  a  grant  for \npoor households (the equivalent of $75 for each household that elects to connect \nto the water supply to construct toilets with septic tanks, and a smaller amount for \nthose  who  decide  not  to  connect,  to  improve  their  toilet  facilities),  subject  to \nsatisfactory  completion  of  sanitation  facilities.  The  household  eligibility  criteria \nand  the  operating  procedure  will  be  determined  by  the  provincial  governments \nconcerned, \nlocal  community \norganizations, and will be satisfactory to ADB. \nThe  government  will  relend  30%  of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply  schemes  in  a \nsubproject  as  a  subsidiary  loan  to  each  relevant  PNP.  The  subsidiary  loan  will \nhave  an  interest  rate  of  6.4%  and  a  maturity  period  of  25  years,  including  a \n6-year  grace  period.  The  balance\u201470%  of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply \nschemes\u2014will  be  provided  to  the  relevant  PNP  as  a  grant.  A  subsidiary  loan \nagreement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be  signed  and  duly  executed  before  any \ndisbursement of funds to the relevant subproject. \nEach  participating  PNP  shall  adopt  a  provincial  utility-wide  progressive  tariff \nstructure  with  three  consumption  blocks  prior  to  disbursement  of  funds  to  the \nrelevant subproject. The tariffs must be set at such levels to (a) recover full O&M \nand gradually increasing depreciation, and (b) maintain a debt service coverage \nratio  of  1.2:1.  Each  PNP  will  undertake  an  annual  tariff  review,  satisfactory  to \nADB and the government, and will implement tariff adjustments by 1 April of each \nyear. \n\n(vi)  MPWT  will  ensure  that  LAR  for  each  subproject  town  is  not  significant  and  is \ndone  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), as set out in the resettlement framework \nand short resettlement plan for each subproject town. A short resettlement plan \nfor  each  subproject \ntown  will  be  prepared,  updated  as  required,  and \nimplemented.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  government  regulations  and \nADB policy, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. \n\n(vii)  MPWT  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  designed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous  peoples  policy  and  the  applicable  framework  agreed  on  by  the \ngovernment  and  ADB.  MPWT  will  further  ensure  that  all  ethnic  groups  have \nequitable opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, and O&M activities \nunder the project. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  MPWT will implement the gender strategy prepared for the project in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development. The government will ensure that \nwomen  receive  at  least  30%  of  new  jobs  generated  by  community-based \ninitiatives under the project and that at least 30% of persons in each community \naction team and each water supply and sanitation unit are women. \nregulations  governing \nThe  government  will  ensure \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), \nare  followed.

The Northern and Central Region Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the project) is supported by ADB, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund \nfor  International  Development  (OFID),  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation \n(NORAD), and United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT).  \n \n2. \nA  French  water  utility  (SEDIF)  promotes  private  investment  in  the  urban  water  supply \nand through a nonprofit association, the Research and Technological Exchange Group (GRET), \nwhich  provides  output-based  subsidies  targeted  at  the  poor.  GRET  is  assisting  the  Ministry  of \nPublic Works and Transport (MPWT) to implement private water supply concessions.  \n \n3. \nNORAD has provided substantial assistance to develop the capacity of the Water Supply \nRegulatory Committee and the Water Supply Department of MPWT, and has been a key partner \nfor previous and ongoing ADB projects.  \n \n4. \nVientiane\u2019s water system and assistance in building the capacity of PNPs.  \n \n5. \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  has  also  supported  capacity  development \nfor PNPs through the construction of the Waterworks Technology Training Center in Vientiane \nand development of training courses.  \n \n6. \nschemes in small towns.  \n \n7. \nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  WSP-EAP,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  the  World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO),  and  UN-HABITAT  are  key  partners  in  hygiene  awareness  and \npromotion  in  communities  and  schools.  ADB  and  the  International  Finance  Cooperation  (IFC) \nare also working with the Government to implement the Enterprise Law and the World Bank and \nthe IFC are supporting State Owned Enterprises governance and reform. \n \nB. \n \n8. \n Since  the  mid  1990s  ADB  has  been  and  continues  to  be  the  dominant  development \npartner in the water supply and sanitation sector. Through its partnership with the Government, \na  sector  investment  plan  and  sector  policy  was  developed  in  the  late  1990s,  which  provided \nguidance  for  the  Government  and  other  development  partners  on  how  the  sector  could  be \nfunded and developed.  \n \n9. \nFurthermore,  sector  coordination  takes  place  when  preparing  new  projects,  through \nindividual  meetings  or  workshops.  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  relatively  small  number  of \ndevelopment  partners  involved  in  the  sector,  this  coordination  has  proven  to  be  effective.  The \nproject itself forms a solid basis for sector coordination itself, since several partners are directly \ninvolved in its implementation. \n \nC. \n \nAlthough  ADB  has  been  by  far  the  largest  and  most  endurable  development  partner, \n10. \nother  partners  and  agencies  have  had  some  involvement  in  the  sector  from  time  to  time. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n\nAchievements, Issues and Recommendations \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4   \n\nAlthough  JICA  and  AFD  have  made  quite  sizable  investments,  other  donors  have  generally \nprovided assistance on a much smaller scale and generally aimed at smaller communities. ADB \nin partnership with NORAD has worked almost exclusively with the Government on a successful \nprogram of sector reform.  \n \n11. \nIn  more  recent  times,  and  especially  with  the  enactment  of  the  Water  Supply  Law  and \nEnterprise Law, the Government recognized the need for structural sector coordination, led by \nthe  government.  The  recently  approved  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject1 includes  support  to    the  WSD  to  convene  development  partner  consultation  meetings \ntwice  a  year  and  to  establish  a  project  and/or  sector  website,  which  will  include  project \ninformation and will be linked to the MPWT website. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nGovernment  socioeconomic  development  strategies  (i.e.,  National  Fifth  Five-Year  Socio-Economic  Plan,  2001\u20132005) \nprioritize  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas,  including  small  towns  in  the  Northern  and  Central  regions.  The \nNorthern  Region  is  the  focus  of  the  country  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  region  has  the  highest \nincidence of poverty, at 52% in 2003, and  25 of the country\u2019s 47 poor districts officially identified by the Government of the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  as  priority  for  development.  The  Central  Region  has  a  poverty  incidence  of \n35%  and  16  priority  poor  districts.  The  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  (September  2001)  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  includes  small  towns  development  as  one  of  the  key  operational  priorities  to  enhance  reciprocal  linkages \nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas.  Specifically,  the  agreement  highlights  (i) integrating  rural  producers  with  urban  markets, \n(ii) enabling  urban  entrepreneurs  to  trade  with  rural  people,  and  (iii) facilitating  access  of  the  rural  and  urban  population  to \ninternational markets.  \n \nProvincial and district towns with populations of 2,000\u201320,000 are classified as small towns. Most of them do not have piped \nwater  supply  with  house  connections,  and  often  lack  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  The  impact  of  poor \nenvironmental conditions (i.e., unclean  water, lack of proper sanitation, and few all-weather access roads) is greater on the \nurban  poor.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  in  the  Lao  PDR.  It  will \nspecifically address target 10\u2014to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water. \nThe project also supports Government Decision 37/PM, Management and Development of the Water Supply Sector (1999). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG, TI-M) \n1. Key Issues  \n \nThere  has  been  consistent  improvement  in  most  socioeconomic  indicators  over  the  past  few  years.  The  country  has \nexperienced  a  sharp  reduction  in  poverty  incidence  in  the  past  10  years:  from  45%  in  1992/93,  to  32%  in  2002/03.  This \nreduction has been associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency, and increased cross-border \ntrade.  However,  the  Lao  PDR  remains  the  least  developed,  as  it  ranks  135th  among  177  countries  in  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  2004  Human  Development  Report.  Economic  development  remains  imbalanced \nthroughout  the  Lao  PDR,  with  marginal  improvements  witnessed  in  the  Northern  Region.  The  Northern  Region  has  the \nhighest  incidence  of  poverty  and  faces  the  greatest  challenges  from  (i) environmental  degradation;  (ii) poor  physical  and \nsocial  infrastructure;  (iii) geographic  remoteness;  and  (iv) limited  access  to  markets,  information,  economic  growth \nopportunities, and good-quality social services.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nAbout 76,000 beneficiaries (or 40%) are estimated to be poor in 2010. The project outputs will directly and indirectly benefit \nthe poor: improved access to water and hygienic sanitation will improve the quality of life, and reduce financial burdens and \nthe burden on women, who are commonly tasked with collecting water and taking care of sick family members. \n \nThe project has a strong focus on poverty. It will contribute to poverty reduction not just by providing clean water supplies and \nsanitation  services  but  also  by  targeting  the  poor.  Poor  households  will  receive  free  initial  water  connection.  Villagers  from \nethnic  minorities  will  be  consulted  to  determine  the  most  suitable  technical  designs  for  water  infrastructure.  The  household \nand public sanitation improvement component will provide poor households with grants to construct sanitation facilities. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis \n  \nThe Lao PDR has a total population of about 5.7 million, with a population density of about 25 persons/km2. Compared with \nneighboring countries, the Lao PDR has one of the highest population growth rates, at 2.5% per year. By 2020, the population \nis  projected  to  reach  8.2  million  people.  About  80%  of  the  population  lives  in  nearly  12,000  small  rural  villages  scattered \nthroughout  the  country,  and  20%  are  urban  residents  in  145  officially  designated  urban  centers  in  142  districts.  While  the \nLao PDR  remains  essentially  a  rural  country,  urban  centers  are  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  its  economy.  The \n\n \n\n\f40   Appendix 6 \n \n\ncountry\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  6.4%  in  1993\u20132002.  The  gross  domestic  product  per \ncapita in 2003 was about $330. The industry sector experienced the highest growth of about 10.5% per year. The growth rate \nof the urban population has increased nearly twice as fast as the national average. \n \nWater supply and environmental improvements are important in controlling disease outbreaks and epidemics associated with \nunsafe and unclean water supply and improper sanitation and hygiene. Overall coverage of piped water supply in small towns \nis about 17%, compared with 69% in Vientiane and the four largest secondary towns. More than 50% of households in small \ntowns do not have any form of water-sealed toilets, and less than 10% of primary schools have latrines. Limited access of the \npoor to roads in the wet season hinders their access to schools, markets, and health facilities.  \n \nThe project will benefit about 89,000 small-town residents in about 12 towns by 2010 and about 100,000 residents by 2015. \nBy  2010,  an  additional  98,000  rural  residents  in  surrounding  areas  will  indirectly  benefit  from  improved  access  to  urban \nmarkets  and  government  services.  The  project  components  are:  (i) institutional  capacity  building  for  the  water  supply \nregulatory office and the water sector division of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport  (DHUP/MPWT);  (ii) the  development  of  a  water  supply  system;  (iii) road,  drainage,  and  sanitation  improvements; \n(iv) participation, awareness, and community actions (PACA); and (v) project implementation assistance to different levels of \nthe  government,  including  district  offices  of  communication,  transport,  posts,  and  construction  (OCTPCs)  and  the  district \nbranches  of  the  provincial  water  supply  companies,  the  provincial  nam  papas  (PNPs).  The  PACA  component  will  support \nongoing  efforts  related  to  hygiene  and  proper  lifestyle,  and  will  coordinate  with  ongoing  health  information,  education,  and \ncommunication campaigns. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nIndividual subcomponents for each project town  were identified through public consultations,  workshops, and meetings with \ndifferent stakeholders. During project design, community meetings were held with beneficiaries to discuss flooding, sanitation, \npoverty,  resettlement,  affordability  issues,  and  environmental  concerns.  Consultations  with  communities  and  beneficiaries \nrevealed  challenges,  strategies,  and  solutions  for  project  design  and  implementation.  Socioeconomic  surveys  obtained \ninformation  and  individual  views  on  current  situations  and  future  preferences.  Similar  surveys,  including  inventory-of-loss \nsurveys, were conducted among resettlement-affected populations. Special consultations were held with poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds, including households with female heads. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project design helped the project \nevolve to its current state.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to help identify the key project stakeholders and their interests. Primary stakeholders \ninclude  residents  in  urban  areas,  resettlement-affected  people,  the  water  supply  regulatory  committee,  the  water  sector \ndivision of DHUP/MPWT, district branches of the PNPs, OCTPCs, and the project management unit. Secondary stakeholders \ninclude  the  principal  and  district  governments,  DCTPCs,  mass  organizations,  and  relevant  line  agencies.  The  stakeholder \nanalysis was helpful during stakeholder consultations for the three sample subprojects. \n \nA  participation  strategy  was  prepared  to  take  into  consideration  different  levels  of  cooperation  and  collaboration  among \nstakeholders.  Levels  of  participation  include  information  exchange,  consultation,  collaboration,  review,  and  comments  on \nreports.  Various  forms  of  communications\u2014weekly  meetings,  workshops,  reviews,  consultation  meetings,  technical  work \ngroups, and planning groups\u2014were used to ensure active participation, project support, and productive feedback. Steps for \nstakeholder participation and consultation have been integrated into the overall project design and individual social plans.  \n \nThe project supports community-based public services that  will allow  greater village participation in the planning process to \nbetter respond to local needs. The project component PACA gives communities information on health and sanitation issues. \nWomen\u2019s  participation  will  be  important,  as  they  are  often  responsible  for  family  health  and  hygiene.  PACA  also  generates \nawareness,  facilitates  community  participation  and  consultation  with  OCTPCs  and  PNPs,  and  encourages  community \nenvironmental and sanitation improvements. For instance, the PNP distribution supervisors will be an important link between \nthe district branch of the PNP and communities. Playing a caretaker role, each will be responsible for a service area of about \n500  connections.  The  supervisors  will  manage  and  maintain  the  system  in  their  designated  area,  address  complaints, \ninterface with water supply and sanitation units, and act as the public face of the PNP in their service area. Having detailed \ninformation  on  the  water  and  sanitation  facilities  of  all  their  customers,  the  supervisors  will  help  to  improve  their  sanitation \nfacilities, provide technical advice, and monitor sanitation conditions. A similar arrangement will be set up by OCTPC to help \nmanage and monitor the conditions of the roads and drainage network. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 6            41 \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nLao women play important roles in agriculture and other economic activities, and are responsible for a variety of tasks related \nto  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  in  their  families  and  within  the  communities.  For  instance,  women  and  children  are  often \nresponsible for collecting water, often from distant sources. In the three sample subprojects, they rely on open wells, nearby \nrivers,  and  bore  wells  for  domestic  water  supply.  Unsafe  water  (i.e.,  high  in  iron  or  calcium  deposits  or  contaminated  with \nwastewater)  adversely  affects  the  health  of  individuals  and  families  (e.g.,  water-related  diseases  and  reproductive  health \nproblems). Upgrading roads will improve women\u2019s access to markets, extension and social services, and information. Public \ntoilet facilities at schools will provide more privacy for girls attending school, and will positively influence enrollment rates. At \npresent,  less  than  10%  of  primary  schools  have  latrines.  Institutionally,  women  are  active  in  the  water  supply  division  of \nDHUP/Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts and Construction, in the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and in OCTPCs and PNPs \nin the districts.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nA gender strategy has been prepared for the project (Appendix 7). \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/\nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nLimited \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLimited \n\nLabor \n\nLimited \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \nFor each subproject town, land acquisition and \nresettlement impact must be category B or not \nsignificant, according to the project\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria. A resettlement framework for the \nproject and a short resettlement plan for \nMuong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao \nsubprojects have been prepared according to \nthe Lao PDR regulations and ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. \nThe Lao PDR is home to 46 ethnic groups, \nwhich can be classified into three broad \ngroups\u2014Lao Loum (majority), Lao Theung, \nand Lao Soung. The population in the project \narea is about 78% Lao Loum, 9% Lao Theung, \nand 14% Lao Soung. The project is expected \nto have minimum adverse impact on ethnic \ngroups of Lao Theung and Lao Soung \n(category B). Nevertheless, an ethnic groups \ndevelopment framework has been prepared\u2014\naccording to government regulations and \nADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy\u2014to help \nassess potential impact on all ethnic groups \nduring feasibility studies. \nLabor is not a potential issue. The project \nhelps to strengthen the current capacity of the \nwater supply authority and water supply \ndivision within DHUP/Ministry of \nCommunication, Transport, Posts and \nConstruction. Local employment opportunities \nwill be generated by the project during \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of \nproject components. Women and ethnic \nminorities will not be discriminated against, \nand will have equal access to employment \nopportunities. About 30% of all jobs generated \nby community-based initiatives (e.g., through \nthe village environmental improvement \ncomponent) will be for women. \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n \n\n\f42   Appendix 6 \n \n\nIssue \nAffordability \n\nSignificant/\nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nLimited \n\nLimited \n\nand/or \n\nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict,  political \ninstability,  etc),  please \nspecify \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nIssues pertaining to affordability are not \nexpected to arise in the project.

The lifeline block and a \ndeferred-payment system for connection \ncharge, which allows poor households to pay \nthe charge over 24 months, free of interest, \nwill benefit the poor by increasing their access \nto project benefits.  \nThe increased risk to HIV/AIDS due to the \nproject is minimal. To keep risks low, the \nproject will (i) collaborate with the department \nof health in the districts to provide links or \nreferrals to ongoing HIV/AIDS awareness \nefforts, and (ii) require contractors to \ndisseminate HIV/AIDS information among their \nlaborers. \n\n \n\n \n\nIV.

The \npurpose of the gender strategy is to suggest specific actions that should be considered during \nsubproject design and implementation to make the project more responsive to women\u2019s water \nsupply and utilization needs. Some measures will help increase women\u2019s access to affordable \npiped water supply, health and hygiene information, and urban infrastructure, and others have \nthe  potential  to  enhance  their  living  conditions.  Female  heads  of  households  affected  by  land \nacquisition and resettlement are eligible for entitlements the same as those for male heads of \nhouseholds. These entitlements and specific measures for vulnerable groups are included in the \nproject\u2019s resettlement framework and individual resettlement plans.  \n \n2. \nThe  gender  strategy  is  based  on  (i) the  three  sample  subprojects  (Muong  Houn, \nMuong Nan, and Kenethao) that have been studied for feasibility in phase 1; (ii) reconnaissance \nsurveys and district-level information data sheets; and (iii) consultations with women of different \nages and ethnic groups, government officials, and mass organizations. The gender strategy is \nbased  on  the  Lao  PDR  regulations  and  the  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  activities  to  be  financed  by  the  supplementary  grant  will  directly  benefit  about \n44,000  small-town  residents  by  2027.  An  estimated  50,000  more  rural  residents  in  the \nsurrounding  areas  will  indirectly  benefit  from  improved  access  to  markets  and  government \nservices.  Of  the  total  94,000  beneficiaries,  about  38,000  people  (or  40%)  will  be  poor.  The \nproject is aimed at improving the quality of life and increase the capacity of the small towns to \nserve  as  market,  services,  and  manufacturing  centers  supporting  the  rural  hinterland.  It  will \nprovide  safe,  reliable,  and  affordable  piped  water  supply,  essential  urban  infrastructure,  and \nvillage environmental improvements (VEIs) in about 12 small district towns in the Northern and \nCentral  regions.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  water  sector  regulation,  policy  development, \nand sector sustainability by supporting the regulating authority and promoting policy, tariff, and \ninstitutional reform. It has a strong community participation focus that complements the project\u2019s \nobjectives  of  reducing  poverty,  and  promoting  health  and  hygiene  within  communities.  The \nproject design encourages a demand-based approach.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nMore  than  85%  of  Lao  women  live  and  work  in  farming  households.  They  perform  the \nbulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. Females spend longer hours \n(i) working  in  upland  agriculture;  (ii) collecting  natural  and  forestry  products  for  processing, \nconsumption,  and  sale;  (iii) manufacturing  handicrafts  for  cash  income;  (iv) raising  small \nlivestock  for  consumption  and  for  cash  income;  and  (v) collecting  water  for  domestic  use. \nDiscussions with women in Muong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao revealed that women and \nchildren  spend  up  to  2  hours  per  day  collecting  water  from  the  source  because  of  distance, \nfrequency of trips, or long queues. In some cases, while the water point was within 100 meters, \nwaiting in queues took time. \n \nPoverty for females means having a heavier work burden, poorer health, less education, \n5. \nless  food,  and  inadequate  rest  compared  with  men.  Access  to  education  is  lower  for \nschoolchildren  living  farther  away  from  schools.  In  Muong  Nan,  about  5%  of  185  household \n\nWomen in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Project Area \n\n \n\n\f44   Appendix 7 \n \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nfound \n\nthree  sample  subprojects,  women  are \n\nheads  interviewed  said  that  female  members  had  attained  primary  education,  while  12%  had \nattained  lower  secondary  education.  Levels  of  attainment  were  lower  in  Muong  Houn,  as  the \ndistance  between  villages  was  greater\u20142%  of  132  households  said  female  members  had \nattained primary education and 2%, lower secondary education.  \n \n6. \nDependency  ratios  are  high  for  poor  households.  Membership  in  large  families  is  an \nindication that family size is part of their coping and survival strategies. In a strong patriarchal \nsociety,  women  have  few  or  no  land  rights,  particularly  among  the  ethnic  communities.  Land \nrights are based on family law, where new land is titled in the husband\u2019s name and is inherited \nby the wife and then the children. Joint ownership depends on individual household preference. \n \n7. \nWomen represent about one-third of all government employees. While representation in \nleadership  positions  at  all  levels  is  limited,  the  director  and  the  deputy  director  in  the  water \nsupply division of the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Ministry of Communication, \nTransport,  Posts  and  Construction  (DHUP/MCTPC)  are  women.

That  goal  is \nreflected  in  the  National  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Women  (NSDW  1998\u20132005),1 in  the \n1991  Constitution  (Articles  22  and  24),  and  in  a  number  of  international  commitments.  The \nNational Commission for the Advancement of Women\u2013Lao PDR (NCAW-Lao) was established \nin  1991  to  help  ensure  women\u2019s  equal  access  to  basic  services  and  productive  resources  for \nachieving equity, efficiency, and effectiveness of policies and projects. NCAW-Lao develops the \nNSDW and reports directly to the government, while the Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implement \nthe NSDW. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  the  objectives  outlined  in  NSDW  1998\u20132005.  Women  will \nbenefit  mostly  through  a  reduction  in  drudgery  and  time  savings  in  water  collection.  The  time \ngained  will  give  women  the  opportunity  to  engage  in  productive  activities  or  family  affairs. \nMoreover,  women  as  caretakers  of  family  health  and  hygiene,  will  benefit  the  most  from  the \nparticipation, awareness, and community actions component. This component will complement \nongoing health and hygiene initiatives within communities, and will coordinate with ongoing and \nplanned  health  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns,  to  which  many  women \nwill  be  accustomed.  For  instance,  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  \u201c3  cleans\u201d  principle  requires  boiling \ndrinking water, cooking food, and cleaning hands before eating and after latrine use. \n \nPublic  latrine  facilities  at  schools  in  both  Muong  Nan  and  Kenethao  can  potentially \n10. \nincrease enrollment rates of girl children in both towns. The construction of latrine facilities must \nconsider specific gender needs (e.g., separate facilities for boys and girls).  \n \nIn Muong Nan, the construction of a bridge will link two parts of the town that are often \n11. \nseparated by the Nan River during the wet season. The results will be greater convenience and \ntime savings; better access to markets, schools, health facilities, and temples; reduced physical \n\nProject Benefits and Impact \n\n                                                 \n1   NSDW 1998\u20132005 is aimed at (i) reducing women\u2019s heavy work burden, (ii) improving women\u2019s health and overall \ncondition,  and  (iii) providing  access  to  clean  water  supply.  A  new  strategy  (2005\u20132010)  is  being  prepared  by \nNCAW-Lao. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                   Appendix 7            45 \n\nburden and risk to women and children using the temporary bridge crossing; and cost savings \nfrom not having to rebuild a temporary bridge that is destroyed by floods every year. \n  \nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe following specific actions will be implemented in each subproject town: \n\nSpecific Actions \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nto  employment, \n\nEqual  access  of  women \ntraining,  and  capacity-building \nopportunities,  district  branches  of  provincial  nam  papas,  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation units.  \nParticipation  of  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  in  the  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs). \nPreference given to women for jobs in community-based improvements.

An \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n46  \n \n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  establishing  safe,  reliable  piped  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  district \n1. \ntowns, and is improving living conditions through urban infrastructure and village improvements. \nFeasibility studies for Namkeung, Namor, Namtha, and Ngoi  were completed as part of project \npreparation. The scope of land acquisition and compensation in each of the four subprojects is \ncategory  B  (not  significant),  as  fewer  than  200  persons  will  experience  major  impact.1 A  land \nacquisition  and  compensation  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  for  future  subproject  towns  during  the  feasibility  phase  of  the  Northern  and \nCentral Regions Water Supply Sector Project in 2005. For phases 2 and 3, appendixes to the \nshort  resettlement  plans  (Supplementary  Appendixes  A\u2013D)  containing  all  unchangeable \ninformation  for  these  phases  were  produced.  The  short  resettlement  plans  therefore  mainly \ncontain  site-specific  information  and  have  to  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  foregoing \nappendixes.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  inventory  of  losses  for  the  short  resettlement  plans  for  the  phase 3  subprojects  is \nbased on the initial design of the physical components in the four district towns of the project, as \noutlined below under three major categories: (i) water supply systems, (ii) urban environmental \nimprovements,  and  (iii) village  environmental  improvements.  The  four  subprojects  will  supply \nabout 44,000 people with 120 liters of water per capita per day by 2027. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n1. \n\nImpact \n \na. \n\nNamor \n\n \n3. \nThe  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  in  Namor  subproject  town  is \n\u201cinsignificant,\u201d  as  only  one  household  (13  affected  persons)  will  be  experiencing  major  impact \n(footnote 1) from relocation to make way for the intake.  \n \n4. \nLAR  will  affect  a  total  of  84  households  (448  affected  persons)  (including  the  one \nhousehold  at  the  intake).  Included  in  these  84  households  are  82  households  (428  affected \npersons)  that  will  experience  a  temporary  loss  of  land  that  will  be  used  during  pipe-laying \nactivities.  This  land  will  be  restored  and  returned  to  the  affected  persons  and  therefore  no \ncompensation  will  be  paid.  Impact  from  water  supply  works  will  be  very  minor  for  each  of  the \nfamilies and will mostly involve broken cement slabs in front of the houses to allow for the pipe \nlaying. The households will be compensated for such minor losses, including temporary ones. \n \nThe water treatment plant (WTP) site is wasteland owned by the government. Because \n5. \npipelines will be laid in the most densely populated area of town, 53 businesses will be affected. \nThe duration of these works, planned for 3 days in every location, will have to be shortened as \nmuch as possible to minimize income losses. \n\n                                                 \n1  Major impact is defined as (i) physical displacement from housing, or (ii) loss of more than 10% of income source, \n\nor (iii) loss of more than 40% of residential structure. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nb. \n\nNgoi \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n\n \n6. \nThe  scope  of  LAR  in  Ngoi  subproject  town  is  \u201cinsignificant,\u201d  as  only  8  households  (37 \naffected  persons)  will  be  experiencing  major  impact  (footnote  1)  from  the  WTP,  intake,  and \nreservoir. The WTP site is on private land used for teak tree plantation. The private land for the \nreservoir  is  used  as  agricultural  land  for  corn,  kha  (a  root  like  ginger),  and  a  natural  growing \nplant used to make oil. The private land for the intake is used for fruit trees.  \n \nLAR  will  affect  a  total  of  64  households  (215  affected  persons),  including  many \n7. \nhouseholds that will suffer only minor inconvenience related to the temporary removal of fences. \nOne  household  will  have  to  be  relocated  to  make  room  for  the  road  to  the  reservoir.  Fifteen \nhouseholds  (70  affected  persons)  will  experience  a  temporary  loss  of  land  that  will  be  used \nduring pipe-laying activities. This land will be restored and returned to the affected persons and \ntherefore no compensation will be paid. The impact from water supply works will be very minor \nfor  each  of  the  families  and  will  mostly  involve  broken  cement  slabs  in  front  of  the  houses  to \nallow  for  the  pipe  laying.  Compensation  will  be  paid  for  all  such  minor  losses,  including \ntemporary ones (if more than the KN1 million deducted for the free water connection).  \n \n8. \nDrainage  work  will  require  some  land,  around  1  meter  wide,  between  houses  and  the \nroad.  This  is  mostly  land  in  the  right  of  way  (ROW)  but  many  houses  have  extended  their \nverandas  and  selling  stalls  in  this  area  with  temporary  permission  from  the  local  authorities. \nThere are 28 households (107 affected persons) affected by drainage works. As their land in the \nROW is not titled, they will not be compensated for the land but only for structural and income \nlosses. \n \n9. \nBecause  road  improvement  and  drainage  works  will  be  done  in  the  most  densely \npopulated area of town, 25 businesses might be affected. However, only 4 of them think it is not \npossible to open their business during the construction, whereas all the other businesses think \nthey can stay open without losing income. \n \n10. \nThe  water-pipe  laying  and  drainage  will  affect  58  trees  of  10  households.  The  WTP, \nintake,  and  reservoir  will  affect  211  trees  from  9  households.  However,  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) will enter into user agreements with the households that have trees in \nthe required area of the WTP where there will not yet be any construction so that they can still \nharvest these trees at a later stage. In this way, only 5 households will immediately experience \na loss of 61 trees. \n\n \nc. \n\nNamkeung \n\nThe scope of LAR in Namkeung subproject town is \u201cinsignificant,\u201d as only 1 household \n\n \n11. \n(4 affected persons) will be experiencing major impact (footnote 1) from intake construction.  \n \n12. \nLAR  will  affect  79  households  (361  affected  persons),  including  many  households  for \nwhich there will be only minor inconvenience associated with the temporary removal of fences. \nNo households are expected to require relocation. Fifty-four households (248 affected persons) \nwill experience a temporary loss of land that will be used during pipe-laying activities. \n \n13. \nbe compensated for the land.  \n \n14. \nTwenty-three households will be affected by road improvements besides land loss in the \nROW,  for  which  no  compensation  will  be  paid.  Losses  will  mostly  involve  the  permanent \n\nThe WTP site is on private wasteland. One household will be affected and will have to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n48  \n \nremoval of cement slabs and veranda roofs (of bamboo and wood), for which compensation will \nbe paid according to current material costs. Also, 16 of these households will experience loss of \nincome because of road construction.  \n \n15. \nBecause  road  improvement  works  will  be  done  in  the  most  densely  populated  area  of \ntown, 45 businesses will be affected. The duration of the drainage and road works will have to \nbe shortened as much as possible to minimize income losses. \n \n16. \n \n\nThe water-pipe laying and road construction will affect 32 fruit trees of eight households. \n\nd. \n\nNamtha \n\nOnly  two  households  (nine  affected  persons)  will  be  experiencing  major  impact \n\n \n17. \n(footnote 1) (at the WTP site).  \n \n18. \nLAR  will  affect  a  total  of  310  households  (1,739  affected  persons),  mostly  temporarily. \nNo  households  are  expected  to  require  relocation.  Of  this  total,  307  households  (771  affected \npersons) will experience a temporary loss of land that will be used during pipe-laying activities \n(pipelines will go through the agricultural land of 22 of these households, and through residential \nland for the remaining households).  \n \n19. \nrelocation.  \n \n20. \ntown, 187 businesses will be affected temporarily.  \n \n21. \nof 49 trees). \n\nNo  households  will  be  affected  in  a  major  way  by  road  improvement  or  will  require \n\nBecause  of  road  improvements  and  pipe  laying  in  the  most  densely  populated  area  of \n\nThe water-pipe laying might affect some fruit trees and rubber seedlings (an initial count \n\n \n2. \n\nVulnerable Groups \n \na. \n\nNamor \n\n \n22. \nThere are five households headed by women (6%) among the affected households.

There  are  two  (3%)  Khmu  families  among  the  interviewed \nhouseholds.  They  are  in  the  Mon-Khmer  language  group,  which  is  patrilineal.  There  are  three \nHmong households (5%) (also called Lao Sung).

One  of  these  households  has  to  be  relocated.  As  they  will  be \nseverely affected, they will have to be compensated accordingly. None of these households is a \nvulnerable household.2 \n\n \nc. \n\nNamkeung \n\nThere  are  four  households  headed  by  women  (5%  of  all  affected  households)  in  five \n\n \n28. \ncore villages.  \n \n29. \nNone  of  the  households  is  very  poor.  Seven  households  are  of  Khmu  ethnic  descent. \nThe Khmu are a subgroup of the Mon-Khmer language group. All the other households are from \nthe  Tai  Kadai  language  group  (also  called  Lao  Loum),  although  they  are  from  different  ethnic \ngroups (Thai Neua, Kalom, Lue, Kheun). \n \nOne household is likely to experience major impact because of major loss of land used \n30. \nfor  agriculture,  and  will  have  to  be  compensated  accordingly.  This  is  a  vulnerable  household \n(footnote 2) and should therefore receive special assistance. \n \n\nd. \n\nNamtha \n\n \n31. \nThere are 14 households headed by women (16%) out of the 90 interviewed households \nin  the  core  villages.  The  majority  of  the  interviewed  households  are  Lao  (66  households,  or \n66%), under the main language group of Tai Kadai (also called Lao Loum). Many are actually of \nTai  Yuan  descent;  the Tai  Yuan  are  also  an  ethnic  group  under  the  main  Tai  Kadai  language \ngroup  and  they  call  themselves  just  Lao  nowadays.  Also  under  this  main  language  group  are \n28 Tai Dam households (26%) but they are patrilateral like many other ethnic groups under the \nMon-Khmer  language  group.  There  are  12  Hmong  households  (11%),  under  the  Sino-Tibetan \nmain  language  group  (also  called  Lao  Sung),  among  the  interviewed  households  in  the  core \nvillages.

An entitlement matrix for the project has been developed for the resettlement \nframework at the feasibility phase of phase 1. \n\nConsultation Process, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure \n\n \nShort  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  (as  part  of  subproject  preparation)  and \n36. \nimplemented  with  the  participation  of,  and  in  consultation  with,  the  affected  people.  A  copy  of \nthe  short  resettlement  plan  in  the  Lao  language  will  be  available  to  affected  persons  at  each \ndistrict office whose villages will have land acquisition and compensation impact. An information \nbooklet in the Lao language will be distributed to the affected persons at the time of subproject \nand  short  resettlement  plan  preparation.  Affected  people  will  be  informed  of  the  process  and \ntheir  rights  to  lodge  grievances  orally  or  in  writing  during  initial  consultations  and  during  the \nsocial or resettlement surveys, and at the time of compensation. They will be exempted from all \ntaxes, administrative, and legal fees.

The Department of \nHousing  and  Urban  Planning  (DHUP)  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  is  the \nexecuting  agency.  A  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  has  been  established  within  DHUP.  An \nintegrated  PIU  has  been  established  for  each  subproject;  it  comprises  representatives  of  the \ndistrict  and provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  (Department  of  Public  Works \nand  Transport,  Office  of  Public  Works  and  Transport),  provincial  water  supply  company \n(provincial nam papa), and district office of health. A provincial project steering committee has \nalso been established in each province to coordinate provincial and district agencies.  \n\n \n2. \n\nMonitoring \n\n \n38. \nThe PCU will coordinate all land acquisition and compensation activities. The PIUs will \nbe  responsible  for  implementation,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  Provincial  and  district \nresettlement committees will be established, with focal person(s) identified at the village level for \nactive  participation  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PIU  will \nprepare  monthly  progress  reports  and  a  final  report  to  the  PCU  upon  the  completion  of  land \nacquisition and compensation activities. The PCU will consolidate the information from the PIUs \nand  any  additional  information  from  the  consultant  supervision  team  in  its  quarterly  progress \nreports to ADB.  \n \n39. \nThe PCU  will engage an independent external monitor, acceptable to ADB, to oversee \nland  acquisition  and  compensation  activities  for  the  subproject  towns.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  and  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  prepared  for  the  project  as  part  of  its \npreparation,  and  were  also  approved  by  the  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Agency.  No \nfurther  approval  for  each  subproject  was  required  by  the  Water  Resources  and  Environment \nAgency,  although  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  IEEs  and  environmental  management  plans  was  sought \nand obtained for each subproject. As part of the preparation work for the supplementary grant, \nIEEs  were  prepared  for  the  subproject  towns  of  Namor,  Namtha,  Nam  Keung,  and  Ngoi  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \nthe \nEnvironmental  Protection  Law  (1999)  of  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  and  its  Implementing  Decree  (2002)  and  Regulation  on  Environmental \nAssessment (2000). These IEEs confirm the category B classification. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  findings  of  the  IEEs  covering  the  following  physical \ncomponents  in  the  four  district  towns  constituting  phase  3  of  the  project,  as  outlined  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  approved  under  the project:  (i) water  supply \nsystems, (ii) urban environmental improvements, and (iii) village environmental improvements. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n(2003)  and  with \n\nDescription of the Environment \n \n1. \n\nClimate \n\n \n3. \nTemperature variation is quite low, with an annual average of about 25\u00b0C, and monthly \naverage values ranging from about 18\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C. Rainfall is more variable for each town, with \nannual  rainfall  over  the  last  10  years  ranging  from  about  450  millimeters  (mm)  to  1,800  mm. \nDuring  the  wet  season,  river  levels  rise  several  meters  and  the  width  of  the  rivers  increases \nsubstantially with fast flow and a high sediment load. During the dry season, the flow is slow and \nthe width is significantly reduced with low sedimentation. \n\n \n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Condition \n\n \nThe  population  of  the  four  subproject  towns  ranges  from  about  4,300  to  9,500,  with  a \n4. \ntotal current population of about 26,000 and a projected 2027 population of 44,000. Streets are \ngenerally poorly formed and unsealed, and have poor drainage. Domestic water is obtained at \npresent from open wells, rivers, streams, and springs that mostly diminish in the dry season and \nsuffer  from  high  turbidity  in  the  wet  season.  A  limited  number  of  small,  basic,  untreated  piped \nwater  supply  systems  are  established  but  generally  serve  only  one  or  two  villages  in  some \ntowns. Daily water collection is the responsibility of the females in the household. Wastewater is \ndisposed of on-site. Those people without toilets generally defecate along the riverbanks or in \nthe  rice  fields.  During  the  wet  season,  the  poor  drainage  results  in  much  ponded  water  and \nboggy ground conditions, which have adverse health effects. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\ntreatment  plants \n\nThe  proposed  water \n\n(WTPs)  are  designed \n\nScreening of Potential Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n5. \nThe four subprojects will supply about 40,000  people  with 120 liters of water per capita \nper  day  by  2027.  Raw  water  sources  have  been  considered  for  each  town.  The  potential \nenvironmental  impact  associated  with  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  water  supply \nsystem  includes:  (i) specific  impact  related  to  the  location  of  the  water  treatment  facilities  and \npipeline routes, (ii) availability and quality of water sources, (iii) discharge of wastewater and sludge \nand  their  impact  on  the  receiving  water,  and  (iv) increased  wastewater  from  the  connected \nhouseholds.    \n \n6. \nWhile there may be forest areas in some project towns, the environmental assessment \nprocedures  ensure  that  no  water  treatment  facilities  or  pipeline  route  will  be  located  in  such \nareas.  \n \n7. \nto  provide \npre-sedimentation,  sedimentation,  and  filtration,  and  will  use  some  chemicals  (alum,  polymer) \nfor effective flocculation and coagulation. The WTPs will produce sludge as a by-product of the \nsedimentation and filtration processes, and the sedimentation sludge may contain small traces \nof  nontoxic  treatment  plant  chemicals.  In  most  cases,  the  expected  sludge  volumes  will  be \nnegligible compared with the overall minimum dry-season flow in the receiving river. The sludge \nmanagement  will  be  controlled  through  environmental  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with \neffluent standards and avoid adverse impact on surface water resources.  \n \n8. \nThe overall improvement of water supply in a town will result in an inherent increase in \ngeneration of wastewater, although there will be no overall increase in biological load, which is \nderived  predominantly  from  domestic  sources.  The  project  includes  a  number  of  measures  to \nmitigate the impact of the relatively small additional quantities of wastewater and sullage, including \ndrainage  improvements  along  main  roads  and  in  villages,  improved  sanitation  facilities  in  public \nbuildings,  and  improved  sanitation  for  poor  households.  Community  environmental  improvement \nprograms will provide funds to the eligible poor households for new or improved sanitation facilities. \nThe community awareness program will also promote good health and hygiene practices. \n \n9. \nPotential environmental impact, such as generation of dust and noise, and soil erosion \ndue  to  excavation,  surface  and  groundwater  contamination  by  spoil,  oil  and  grease,  and  wastes \nduring  construction,  will  be  short term  and  can  be  minimized  through  good  engineering  and \nconstruction  practices.  Water  distribution  pipelines  and  road  construction  and  upgrading  will  be \nlocated within the right of way wherever feasible. \n \n10. \nUnexploded  ordnance  (UXO)  can  also  be  a  serious  risk  in  the  Lao  PDR.  UXO  maps  are \nreviewed  and  local  authorities  are  consulted  to  establish  the  presence  of  UXO.  Of  the  four \nsubproject towns, only Ngoi has been subject to any bombing. UXO pathfinding has already been \nconducted  in  the  town  for  topographic  survey,  and  further  detailed  survey  and  clearance  will  be \nconducted before any construction work. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nInstitutional  responsibilities.  As  outlined  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident  (RRP)  for  the  project, 1  five  main  government  institutions  are  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the project. The Department of Housing and Urban Planning of the Ministry of \nPublic  Works  and  Transport  is  the  executing  agency.  A  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  has \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\nfor  each  subproject; \n\n(PIU)  has  been  established \n\n54  \n \nbeen established within the Department of Housing and Urban Planning. An integrated project \nit  comprises \nimplementation  unit \nrepresentatives  of  the  district  and  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport \n(Department  of  Public Works  and Transport,  Office  of  Public  Works and  Transport),  provincial \nwater  supply  company  (provincial  nam  papa),  and  district  office  of  health.  A  provincial  project \nsteering committee (PPSC) has also been established in each province to coordinate provincial \nand district agencies.  \n \n12.  Within the PIU, the Department of Public Works and Transport has overall responsibility \nfor subproject implementation and coordination with the PPSC and other provincial and district \nagencies. Its environmental responsibilities include: (i) assisting in the preparation of IEEs, and \nannual  monitoring  report;  (ii)  monitoring  and  reporting  to  PCU  and  PPSC;  and  (iii) assisting in \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  related  to  urban  development  components.  The \nprovincial  nam  papa  is  also  responsible  for  implementing  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring related to the water supply and sanitation component. \n \n13. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  and  mitigation  plan. Water quality sampling is conducted \nregularly during the wet and dry seasons to establish a baseline and provide data for treatment \noptions  and  environmental  mitigation  measures.  PIUs  are  responsible  for  periodic  monitoring. \nDuring construction, periodic monitoring and inspection will be conducted to minimize dust and \nnoise  generation,  soil  erosion,  waste  generation,  surface  and  groundwater  contamination, \nhealth  impact  on  workers,  and  public  disturbance  associated  with  the civil  works  for  the  water \nsupply and urban improvements. During operation, a water quality monitoring plan will be made \navailable. The plan will provide for (i) daily water quality monitoring (chlorine level and raw water \nquality)  at  the  water  treatment  plant,  (ii)  periodic  sludge  inspection,  and  (iii)  monthly  water \nquality monitoring in the distribution system. A full range of physical, chemical, and bacteriological \ntests will be conducted at the inlet every 6 months in the first year and yearly thereafter. \n \n14. \nAs  part  of  the  environmental  management,  procedures  are  being  developed  for: \n(i) workers\u2019 health and safety, (ii) sludge release, and (iii) waste disposal and chemical handling \nfor  construction  wastes  and  WTP.  The  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  plans  for  water  treatment  plants  and  in  construction  contracts.  The \ncommunity health and awareness program will also provide capacity building in environmental \nmanagement  activities  such  as  regular  cleanup  of  drains  and  collection  of  solid  wastes  to \nstrengthen the communities\u2019 environmental management practices. \n \n15. \nA total of $170,000 was allocated in the RRP for the project for environmental monitoring and \ninternational  environmental  specialist \nmitigation.  This \n(6 person-months  over  4.5  years)  and  a  domestic  environmental  specialist  (9 person-months, \nintermittent) to assist the PMU and PIUs in the overall environmental aspects including training. These \nconsultants will continue their tasks in the four subprojects. \n \nF. \n \nA  community  consultation-participation  strategy  was  developed  during  project \n16. \npreparation. According to this strategy, public consultation was conducted in the four subproject \ntowns.  It  included  reconnaissance  and  comprehensive  social  surveys,  and  consultation \nmeetings  and  interviews  with  provincial  and  district  government  departments,  village  leaders, \nand associations. \n \n17.  While  the  participants  welcomed  the  proposed  design  of  the  water  supply  system  and \nurban infrastructure improvement activities, they raised environmental concerns including poor \nwater  quality,  contamination  of  surface  water  by  water  treatment  plants,  waste  products,  and \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nrecruiting  an \n\nthe  cost  of \n\nincluded \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n55 \n\nchemicals, and flooding due to poor drainage. Those concerns were taken into account in the \nselection  of  reliable  sources,  the  provision  of  chemical  handling  procedures,  and  the \nimprovement of drainage channels.  \n \nContinuous  dialogue  with  the  communities  affected  by  the  subprojects  and  relevant \n18. \nimplementation.  During \ngovernments  will  be  carried  out  during  detailed  design  and \nimplementation,  PCU  and  PIUs  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  and  issues  raised  by  the \nsubproject  communities  will  be  addressed  and  adequate  feedback  to  the  communities  will  be \nprovided. \n \nG. \n \n19. \nThe  proposed  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  cause  any  adverse  environmental  impact \nbecause the potential negative impact will be mainly during construction and will be temporary, \nminor, and localized in extent and can be mitigated to acceptable levels. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n56  \n \n\nSUMMARY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nA. \n \n \n \n1. \nFinancial  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  water  supply  component  in  the  four  district \ntowns constituting phase 3 of the project to evaluate the financial performance of the provincial \nnam  papas  (PNPs).  As  agreed  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \ngovernment,  the  financial  analysis  have  been  undertaken  on  the  basis  of  a  PNP-wide  (utility) \nwater  tariff,  as  recommended  by  the  water  supply  regulatory  committee  (WSRC)  in  its  2008\u2013\n2010  Tariff  Review.  Financial  analyses  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects 1  and  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial \nAppraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.2 \n \n\n \n2. \n\nBases for Financial Projections \n\n \nThe  financial  projections  are  presented  in  Lao  kip  on  a  current  price  basis.  Revenues \n2. \nand costs are converted from a constant 2009 price basis to current prices using projected local \ninflation  rates.  Each  PNP  participating  in  the  project  will  implement  utility  wide  tariffs  that  are \nsufficient  to  (i)  fully  recover  utility  wide  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  including \nsubproject  O&M  costs;  (ii)  recover  utility  wide  debt  service,  including  subproject  debt  service; \n(iii)  maintain  a  utility  wide  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.2  by  the  first  year  of  subproject  debt \nservice;  (iv)  gradually  recover  an  increasing  proportion  of  annual  depreciation  expense  of  the \nutility  wide  fixed  assets,  including  subproject  fixed  assets;  and  (v)  maintain  its  accounts \nreceivable  at  less  than 90  days  of  annual  sales.  Operating  revenues  were  derived  from  water \nsales,  meter  rental  charges,  connection  fees  (non-domestic  only),  and  miscellaneous  income. \nAnnual  O&M  costs  by  major  expense  item  (personnel,  electricity,  chemicals,  maintenance, \nadministration,  new  connection  costs)  for  the  subproject  were  based  on  the  technical  team\u2019s \nestimates, calculated on the basis of the operating characteristic of the system. The projections \nincorporate  turnover  tax  of  5%  of  water  sales  and  10%  of  other  sales.  Depreciation  expense \nwas  calculated  on  an  average  asset  life  of  25  years  on  a  straight-line  basis.  Income  tax  was \nthen applied at the rate of 35% on pre-tax income, or 1% of PNP revenue if there was no pre-\ntax income. \n \n3. \nThe  subproject  capital  costs  are  based  on  the  technical  team\u2019s  estimate,  inclusive  of \nengineering  base  costs,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during  construction. \nInterest  during  construction  is  capitalized  and  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  subproject.  The \nfinancial  analysis  assumes  that  subproject  financing  is  provided  by  way  of  government  grant \nand loan financing. Thirty percent of the subproject capital cost will be lent to the PNP through a \nsubsidiary loan while the balance will be provided as a grant. \n \n \n \nSubprojects will apply utility wide tariffs. A rising three-block tariff structure for domestic \n4. \nconsumers has been adopted in the analysis, incorporating a lifeline block of up to 7.5 m3 per \nmonth (minimum consumption of 50 liters per capita per day [lpcd]) to ensure affordability by the \nlow-income  households.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  domestic \nconsumers,  particularly  those  in  the  low-income  group,  can  afford  the  projected  water  tariff \nlevels that meet the financial objectives of the sector. The results of the analysis are presented \n\nTariffs and Affordability \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

However, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n58  \n \nsince the introduction of WSRC recommended tariffs in 2008/09, it is expected that the financial \nperformance of all PNPs will improved markedly. Based on the WSRC recommended tariffs, the \nprojected  financial  performance  of  the  PNPs  for  the  period  2009\u20132016  indicate  that  the  PNPs \nare projected to earn positive net income each year over the forecast period. More than 100% of \nannual depreciation expense (historical cost) is recovered during the forecast period. The PNPs \nare also projected to generate positive net cash flow each year over the forecast period, which \ncan  be  used  to  fund  much  needed  rehabilitation  and  expansion  work  in  its  service  area.  As  a \nresult, the PNPs will require no further subsidies and will be able to fund all O&M expenses and \ndebt  service,  and  generate  an  increasing  cash  surplus.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  is \nprojected to remain well above 1.2 times in all years. \n \n \n \nThe  economic  sustainability  of  the  subprojects  depends  on  the  subproject\u2019s  financial \n6. \nsustainability.  Unless  the  subproject  is  financially  sustainable,  the  economic  benefits  assumed \nin  the  analysis  will  not  materialize.  The  projected  financial  performances  for  the  subprojects \nhave shown that the agreed upon financial objectives of cost recovery (i.e., full O&M cost and \ngradually increasing portion of annual depreciation) and debt service (not less than 1.2 times) \nfor the sector could be met. Meeting the financial objectives of the sector indicates subproject \nfinancial  sustainability.  The  attainment  of  the  financial  objectives,  however,  would  require  that \ntariffs  are  periodically  raised  in  line  with  WSRC\u2019s  recommendations  and  to  keep  pace  with \ninflation. \n \nB. \n \n\nSustainability \n\n5. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n \n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n7. \nEconomic  analyses  for  the  water  supply  and  urban  environmental  improvement \ncomponents  in  the  four  district  towns  constituting  phase  3  of  the  project  were  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects, 3 Guidelines  for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects, 4  and  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects.5  \n \nThe  incremental  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  each  water \n8. \nsupply and urban environmental improvement component were estimated and are expressed in \nconstant February 2009 prices in Lao kip. All costs were derived from the financial project costs \nand  re-expressed  in  economic  prices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire.  Taxes  and  duties \nwere  deducted  as  appropriate  from  base  costs.  Tradable  components  were  adjusted  to \neconomic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.05  while  non-traded  components \nwere  valued  at  domestic  market  prices.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.71  for  unskilled  labor \nwas applied to reflect its opportunity cost in the context of wide availability of labor in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  Subproject  components  are  assumed  to  have  useful  economic \nlife  of  25  years;  the  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  of  the  components  are  assumed  to \nhave useful economic life of 5 years. \n \n \n \n9. \nWater  demand  in  the  district  towns  was  derived  from  the  current  population  within  the \nplanned service area, population growth, current and future domestic water consumption levels, \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

Households  typically  use  a  variety  of \nwater  sources  and  do  not  measure  or  assess  their  consumption.  It  is  estimated  that  average \ndaily  demand  from  existing  sources  of  non-piped  water  ranges  between  40  and  70  lpcd. \nInternationally  accepted  lifeline  consumption  requirement  was  estimated  to  be  50  lpcd.  Per \ncapita  water  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  after  construction  of  the  piped  water  supply \nsystem, due primarily to (i) the reduced cost of acquiring water, (ii) improved water quality, and \n(iii) greater convenience and reliability of the piped water supply system. \n \n \n \n10. \nLeast-cost  analysis  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  different  technical  options,  including \nalternative  water  sources,  the  size  and  timing  of  water  treatment  plants,  reservoirs,  and \ntransmission mains. The analysis compares various technical alternatives with similar or equal \nestimated benefits. The alternative with the lowest NPV is recommended for engineering design \nand benefit-cost analysis. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe principal benefits that would be derived from the development of a system of piped, \ntreated  water  include  improved  accessibility,  convenience  and  reliability  of  water  supply, \nincreased  quantities  of  water  and  improved  water  quality,  and  greater  health  benefits. \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  of  improved  water  supply  services  include  (i)  benefits  from \nnon-incremental water consumption, valued at the weighted average supply price of water from \nnon-piped  sources;  (ii)  incremental  water  consumption,  valued  at  average  demand  price;  and \n(iii) other resource savings. The weighted average water supply costs of existing water sources \nare estimated at KN12,103 per m3 in Namkheung, KN13,181 per m3 in Namor, KN9,117 per m3 \nin Namtha and KN11,966 per m3 in Ngoi. The average demand price is estimated at KN8,151 \nper m3 in Namkheung, KN8,465 per m3 in Namor, KN6,208 per m3 in Namtha and KN6,958 per \nm3  in  Ngoi.  Health  benefits,  likely  to  occur  provided  that  the  adverse  health  impact  of  an \nincreased volume of wastewater can be minimized, have not been quantified and included in the \nanalysis due to lack of reliable data. \n \n12. \nThe  urban  environmental  improvement  component  will  significantly  improve  the \nenvironmental and living conditions and public health in the subproject areas. The improvement \nin the environment may be reflected in the amounts people are willing to pay for property either \nin  terms  of  rent  or  the  purchase  price  of  the  property  in  the  subproject  areas.  In  Namkheung, \nNamor, Namtha, and Ngoi subproject areas, existing land values amount to KN50,000 per m2, \nKN90,000  per  m2,  KN80,000  per  m2,  and  KN70,000  per  m2,  respectively,  as  provided  by  their \nrespective town officials. The respective town officials estimate that the increase in land value \nas a result of the subprojects would be about 25%. \n \n \n \n13. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  calculation  of  the  subprojects,  as \nshown  below,  are  well  above  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  It  can  be \nconcluded that the proposed subprojects are economically viable under the base case scenario \nand  also  under  adverse  changes  in  conditions,  except  in  some  cases.  The  adverse  changes \nanalyzed were: (i) a capital cost overrun of 10%, (ii) a 10% increase in the O&M cost, (iii) a 10% \nreduction  in  the  benefits,  and  (iv)  a  year\u2019s  delay  in  the  subproject  benefits.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  proposed  subprojects  are  most  sensitive  to  delay  in  subproject \nbenefits, but remain well above the economic opportunity cost of capital except in Namkheung. \n \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n60  \n \n\nTable A10.2: EIRR and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSV \n\nSV \n\nSV \n\nSVb \n\nEIRR \n\nEIRR \n\nEIRR \n\n26.0% \n\nNgoi \nSI \n\nNamor \nSI \n\nNamtha \nSI \n\n \n2.0 \n0.3 \n2.6 \n\n \n2.3 \n0.3 \n2.9 \n \n\nNamkheung \nSIa \n\n+10% \n+10% \n-10% \n1 Year \n\n \nChange  EIRR \n\n21.9% \n19.9% \n21.6% \n19.4% \n17.9% \n\n \n20.1% \n18.3% \n50% \n294%  19.9% \n17.8% \n39% \n16.7% \n\n \n \n  39% \n67% \n  43%  23.9%  1.5 \n312%  25.6%  0.3  340%  18.7%  0.5  217% \n  31% \n  35%  23.3%  1.9 \n52% \n \n \n\n \nKey Variable \nWater Supply \nBase case \nCapitalcCost \nO&M cost \nBenefits \nBenefits Delay \nUrban Environmental Improvement \nBase case \n \nCapital cost \nO&M cost \nBenefits \nBenefits delay \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \na  SI (ratio of % change in EIRR above the cut-off rate of 12% to % change in a variable). \nb  SV (% change in a variable to reduce the EIRR to the cut-off rate of 12%). \nSource: ADB. 2005.
