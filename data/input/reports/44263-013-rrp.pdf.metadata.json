The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA), Implementing the Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program, to support \nprogram  implementation,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  program  represents  a  medium-  to  long-term  partnership  between  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  of  Cambodia  and  seeks  to  improve  financial \ninclusion  by  supporting  the  development  of  an  efficient  and  stable  financial  sector.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  priority  areas  include  (i)  increasing  access  to  finance  for  rural  households,  the \nagriculture  sector,  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs);  (ii)  enhancing  financial \nsystem  stability;  and  (iii)  upgrading financial  sector  infrastructure to support the  introduction  of \nnew  financial  services  and  products.  The  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  development  problem.  Cambodia  achieved  and  sustained high  economic growth \nat  an  average  of  6%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  annum  during  2007\u20132015.  This \ngrowth  supported  a  dramatic  reduction  in  poverty,  with  poverty  rates  declining  from  47.8%  in \n2007  to  13.5%  in  2014.  However,  economic  growth  could  be  more  inclusive.  Higher  poverty \nlevels occur in rural areas (19.9% of the rural population in 2012), where 90.0% of poor people \nlive. In addition, a large share of the population remains vulnerable to poverty, having moved to \njust above the poverty line. In 2011, while only 10% of Cambodians lived on less than $1.25 per \nday (in purchasing power parity), 41% lived on less than $2 per day and 72% lived on less than  \n$3 per day.3\n Financial inclusion is seen as one important channel to further reducing households\u2019 \nvulnerability to falling into poverty.4 Expansion of formal financial services and financial literacy \nis  expected  to  address  the  issues  of  high  transaction  costs  and  overindebtedness  of  poor \nhouseholds.  However,  in  2015,  a  comprehensive  financial  inclusion  study  highlighted  a  major \nproblem  of  financial  exclusion  in  the  country.5 The  study  estimated  that  only  59%  of  the  adult \npopulation  has  access  to  formal  finance\u201468%  in  urban  areas  and  only  55%  in  rural  areas. \nFurther, the study indicated that 30% of the adult population is excluded from both formal and \ninformal financial services altogether.  \n \nCambodia\u2019s  banking  industry  grew  rapidly  between  2001  and  2015  with total  assets  at \n4. \n$19.9  billion.  Credit  to  the  private  sector  rose  from  6.0%  of  GDP  in  2001  to  62.7%  of  GDP  in \n2015 and total deposits reached 58.5% of GDP in 2015 compared with 10.4% of GDP in 2001. \nBetween  2011  and  2015,  the  number  of  commercial  banks  operating  in  Cambodia  increased \nfrom  31  to  36.  Microcredit  has  also  flourished  in  the  same  period  and  the  number  of \nmicrofinance  institutions  operating  in  Cambodia  grew  from  30  in  2011  to  58  in  2015.  This \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2016\u20132018.

Manila. \n5   United Nations Capital Development Fund. 2015. FinScope Consumer Survey 2015. Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\fdevelopment in the banking industry has been supported by the government\u2019s financial market \nreforms  which  have  been  sequenced  in  an  orderly  manner  since  2001  (para.  11).  Unlike  the \nsituation  in  many  of  its  regional  peers,  majority  foreign  ownership  of  financial  institutions  is \nallowed  in  Cambodia,  the  government  neither    sets  interest  rates  on  loans  or  deposits  nor \nimposes lending quotas or practice directed lending. \n\n \n5. \nDespite this impressive growth in the banking industry, lending is fragmented with credit \nreadily  available  in  urban  centers  while  the  rural  areas  remain  underserved.  The  agriculture \nsector and small farmers in particular have been disadvantaged as agriculture-related lending is \nseen as relatively risky. Interest rates are typically higher to cover the risk, which increases the \ncost for the borrower. Additionally, there is a skewed distribution of bank branches which serves \nthe needs of urban rather than rural communities. In 2015, commercial banks had 36% of their \nbranches in Phnom Penh. While 64% are outside of the capital, most are owned by one of the \nleading  commercial  banks  with  a  large  national  network.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector \n(insurance  and pension funds) is very small and this is also an impediment to the development \nof  a  more  inclusive  financial  system.  An  incomplete  legal  framework  for  financial  products, \nservices,  and  consumer  protection;  poor  financial  literacy  among  most  of  the  population;  and \ninsufficient  financial  infrastructure  (such  as  payments  systems)  have  all  contributed  to  a \nfinancial sector that is not inclusive enough. \n\n \nAt the same time, the banking industry is exposed to significant risks. The large number \n6. \nof  banks  operating  in  Cambodia,  combined  with  rapid  credit  expansion,  poses  formidable \nchallenges  to  implementing  sound  bank  supervision.  The  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC) \nestablished  a  prudential  bank  supervision  framework  in  2011  although  continued  capacity \ndevelopment  support  will  be  necessary.  Cambodia  has  a  highly  dollarized  economy,  meaning \nthat the NBC has limited monetary policy options to manage financial system risks (i.e., limits to \nthe  NBC  as  a  lender  of  last  resort).  The  highly  dollarized  economy  also  impedes  the \ndevelopment  of  a  local  currency  capital  market.  The  government  has  been  promoting  local \ncurrency  through  relatively  small  recurrent  transactions  including  payrolls  and  utility  bills. \nHowever,  money  markets  and  government  bond  markets,  which  are  the  building  blocks  for  a \ncapital  market,  do  not  yet  exist.  Local  currency  bond  markets  perform  an  essential  function  in \nproviding capital market participants with a risk-free yield curve reflecting sovereign credit. This \nyield  curve  provides  fundamental  price  discovery  and  serves  as  the  foundation  for  more \ncomprehensive financial sector development including growth in insurance and pension funds. \nMoreover,  the  introduction  of  more  advanced  products,  such  as  corporate  and  structured \nfinance,  infrastructure  finance,  and  eventually  hedging  mechanisms,  is  also  dependent  on  the \ndevelopment of a risk-free government yield curve. \n \n7. \nBinding constraints. The government has recognized the set of challenges it needs to \ndeal with to make the financial sector more inclusive and stable with supporting infrastructure,  \nincluding: (i) access to financial products and services to the poor are limited, (ii) financial sector \nstability  framework  is  weak,  and  (iii)  the  financial  infrastructure  is  underdeveloped.  These \nconstraints are discussed in paras. 8\u201310. \n \nAccess  to  financial  products  and  services  to  the  poor  is  limited.  Four  main \n8. \nconstraints  on  access  to  finance  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  financial  literacy  among  the \npopulation  is  low,  (ii)  consumer  protection  from  unfair  business  practices  is  lacking,  (iii)  the \nregulatory  regime  does  not  promote  new  financial  products  and  services,  and (iv)  financing  to \nsmall farmers and agriculture, and SMEs is limited. As a start, the financial sector would benefit \nfrom a comprehensive financial inclusion strategy that identifies short-, medium-, and long-term \ninterventions  designed  to  make  the  financial  sector  more  inclusive  and  to  promote  financial \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nliteracy.  Financial  literacy  programs  do  not  exist  in  school  curriculums,  government  public \noutreach programs, or the banking industry itself. There is no consumer protection law,6 which is \ncritical  to  establishing  confidence  in  the  financial  sector.  The  regulatory  regime  for  promoting \nnew  financial  products  and  services  is  insufficient.  For  example,  the  insurance  law  has  been \namended  which  has  established  a  framework  for  entry  into  the  sector,  basic  prudential \nstandards,  risk-based  capital  and  solvency  requirements,  and  micro  insurance.  However,  the \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  are  still  being  developed.  Agriculture  financing  for  farmers \nand rural households is not readily available. The government-owned Rural Development Bank \n(RDB)  promotes  credit  to  the  agriculture  sector,  but  its  financial  performance  has  been  poor \nbecause of operational inefficiencies related to lack of staff skills, poor risk management, and a \nlow capital base. The RDB requires restructuring to improve financial performance to increase \ncredit  availability.  The  financial  inclusion  survey  (footnote  5)  reported  that  SMEs  are  also \nunderserved because they are perceived to present higher risk. Therefore, SMEs would benefit \nfrom a market-based partial credit guarantee scheme that would help reduce banks\u2019 commercial \nrisks in lending to such enterprises. \n \nFinancial sector stability framework is weak. The government\u2019s primary approach to \n9. \nenhancing stability is to build confidence in the domestic financial system and in the use of local \ncurrency.  To  build  confidence,  the  government  is  addressing  three  main  constraints:  (i)  weak \nfinancial  market  coordination  among  key  government  agencies,  (ii)  absence  of  a  deposit \nprotection  scheme,  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  a  local  currency  government  bond  market.  While  the \nNBC has established a financial stability unit, coordination across key government departments \nand agencies requires strengthening. In particular, a coordination mechanism that includes the \nNBC  (bank  supervision),  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  (fiscal  policy),  and  the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) (capital market) is critical to ensure \nexchange of financial market information and a coordinated response in the event of a financial \ncrisis.  With  the  rapidly  expanding  bank  deposit  base  there  is  a  need  for  a  deposit  protection \nscheme to ensure the continuing participation of depositors. Finally, while it will be a long-term \nchallenge, the development of a local currency government bond market is necessary to provide \nthe government with more effective monetary policy tools to manage financial system risks, and \nto develop a capital market and institutional investor base. \n \nFinancial infrastructure is underdeveloped. The infrastructure supporting the financial \n10. \nsector  has  critical  gaps  that  inhibit  wider  participation  by  stakeholders  and  constrain  financial \nsector development. Three constraints need to be addressed: (i) the payment system needs to \nbe  upgraded,  (ii)  enabling  laws  for  e-commerce  financial  services  and  trust  products  do  not \nexist,  and  (iii)  compliance  with  the  global  standards  for  anti-money  laundering  needs  to  be \nstrengthened.  With  support  from  ADB,  the  NBC  has  been  developing  a  payments  and \nsettlement  system,  and  further  upgrades  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  infrastructure \n(such as for e-payment and mobile remittance) promotes financial inclusion. There is a demand \nfor digital finance and e-commerce infrastructure as part of the solution to connecting the poor \nand  rural  communities  with  the  financial  sector.  To  allow  this  to  happen,  enabling  laws  on  \ne-commerce  are  necessary.  Enabling  laws  are  also  necessary  to  develop  other  financial \nproducts  and  services.  For  example,  a  trust  law  would  provide  critical  investment  vehicles  for \nthe  financial  system,  such  as  investment  trusts.  The  government  has  strengthened  its  anti-\nmoney-laundering  protocols  and  was  removed  from  the  grey  list  by  the  Financial  Action  Task \nForce in February 2015. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to achieve full compliance with \n\n                                                \n6  A consumer protection law sets up a regulatory framework to protect consumers from unfair business practices. To \n\nenforce the law, a consumer protection agency is normally established. \n\n \n\n\fglobal  standards  so  that  global  counterparties  do  not  otherwise  limit  the  nature  and  extent  of \nfinancial transactions with Cambodian financial institutions. \n  \n11. \nThe government\u2019s sector strategy. The government has taken a sequenced approach \nto financial sector development. With ADB support, the government developed a series of rolling \nfinancial  sector  development  strategies  (FSDSs)  covering  2001\u20132025  (figure  1).  Beginning  in \n2001, reforms focused on rehabilitating the banking industry through liberalizing bank licensing \nand  allowing  foreign  ownership.  The  government  (through  the  NBC)  then  focused  on \nestablishing prudential bank standards and supervision capabilities and developing the financial \nsector infrastructure such as a payments and settlement system. From 2011 to 2015, the NBC \nincreased  its  focus  on  developing  the  microfinance  subsector.  With  continued  support  from \nADB,  the  FSDS  is  currently  being  updated  as  the  FSDS,  2016\u20132025.7 The  objective  of  the \nstrategy  is  to  develop  a  sound  financial  sector  that  can  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by \nsupporting  economic  growth  and  increasing  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  finance.  The  FSDS,  \n2016\u20132025  continues  to  support  the  development  of  the  nonbanking  subsector  and  capital \nmarkets,  and  calls  for  the  alignment  of  regulations  and  supervision  practices  towards \ninternational  standards,  the  delivery  of  new  financial  services  and  products,  and  the \nestablishment of a formal crisis management mechanism. A specific emphasis will be placed on \nfinancial inclusion by providing financial products and services to the low-income segment of the \npopulation.  The  government  also  considers  its  commitments  under  the  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity Blueprint 2015\u20132025 as a catalyst for continued domestic financial market reforms \nand capital market integration. \n\n \n\n Figure 1: Asian Development Bank\u2019s Engagements in Financial Sector Development \n\n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  had  a  long  productive  engagement  with  Cambodia  in \nsupport  of  financial  sector  development  through  a  series  of  well-sequenced  programmatic \napproaches and policy-based loans and TA, as well as grant projects all aligned with the FSDS \nseries (figure 1).8 Beginning in 2001, the first Financial Sector Program, 2001\u20132005 established \n\nSource: ADB staff. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n7  ADB provided project preparatory TA under the former name of the Fourth Financial Sector Program. \n8  ADB.  2001.

TA  was  provided  to  the  NBC  to  establish  a  financial \nintelligence  unit  in  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (CAFIU)  to  counter  money  laundering  and \nprevent  the  financing  of  terrorism.  The  Third  Financial  Sector  Program,  2011\u20132015  initiated \nADB\u2019s first support to the capital market, and incorporated the recommendations of Cambodia\u2019s \nfirst  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program. 11  ADB  supported  the  eventual  adoption  of  a \nsubdecree  on  bankruptcy  and  a  code  of  corporate  governance  for  listed  companies,  and \nprovided capacity building to staff at the SECC, including scholarships for the certified financial \nanalyst  program.  To  increase  investor  confidence,  a  national  arbitration  center  for  out-of-court \ndispute resolution was established. \n \n13. \nLessons learned from the experience. Three lessons have been learned during ADB\u2019s \nlong  engagement  in  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  that  have  helped  inform  this  program.  First, \nADB\u2019s  experience  underscores  that  finance  sector  development  is  hierarchical  and  that \nsequencing  of  reforms  matters.  Key  foundation  reforms  to  the  banking  sector  must  be \nsuccessfully  implemented  before  moving  on  to  complex  or  higher  order  reforms  to  the  \nnonbanking sector including government and corporate bonds and capital market development. \nADB support started with the rehabilitation of the banking sector and has gradually expanded its \nassistance  to  nonbanking  sector  and  capital  market  development  and  promoting  financial \ninclusion. Second, government ownership of reforms articulated through a series of FSDSs has \nensured  financial  sector  development  is  based  on  well-planned  steps,  where  each  step  is \nsupported by solid technical inputs, and government consultations with stakeholders to achieve \nbroad  support  for  reforms.  For  example,  ADB  support  to  the  development  of  the  payments \nsystem has followed sequenced approach starting with the development of the policy framework \nfollowed  by  the  establishment  of  the  legal  regime  and  then  implementation  of  the  payments \nsystem \ninclusive  requires  a \ncomprehensive  approach  including  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  to  expand  the  coverage  of \nfinancial  products  and  services  to  the  poor,  consumer  protection,  promoting  the  use  of  digital \nfinance and e-commerce to connect the poor with the financial sector, and investing in financial \nliteracy of the population. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  value  added  to  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  program.  ADB \nprovided direct support to the program, which advances reforms from previous ADB programs \nand TAs  (para.  12).  For  example,  ADB  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  forum  between the \ngovernment and civil society to support the implementation of the National Strategy for Financial \n\nfinancial  sector  more \n\ninfrastructure.  Third, \n\nto  make \n\nthe \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nSector  Program  II.

ADB will also support the implementation of the revised \nInsurance  Law  to  promote  microinsurance.  ADB  will  continue  to  support  the  development  of \ndraft  laws,  including  Trust  and  e-Commerce  Laws,  and  will  provide  assistance to  upgrade  the \npayment system.   \n \n15. \nDonor  coordination.  Support  to financial  sector  development  is  coursed  through  NBC \nand  anchored  by  the  FSDSs.  ADB  is  the  lead  donor  and  provides  comprehensive  support  in \ncoordination  with  a  number  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors.  Under  the  FSDSs,  the  World \nBank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  are  providing  support  to  financial  stability  and \ngovernance  issues.  The  Korea  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  providing  targeted \nassistance to capital market development, and in particular the equity market, while the United \nStates  is  supporting  the  development  of  a  depositor\u2019s  protection  scheme.  The  International \nFinance  Corporation  is  supporting  access  to  finance,  including  secured  transactions.  The \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has been working to commercialize the agriculture sector \nand is promoting agriculture finance. The United Nations Development Programme has recently \nlaunched a financial inclusion program. ADB staff joined the International Monetary Fund article \nIV mission for the first time in July 2016.  \n\n \n16. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loans.  The  use  of  a  programmatic \napproach with policy-based loans providing budget support leverages a long-term policy reform \nprogram.  The  program  will  have  three  subprograms  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \nupdated  FSDS,  2016\u20132025.  The  program  will  first  support  the  completion  of  a  draft  national \nstrategy for financial inclusion for rural areas, agriculture, and SME development. The program \nwill  then  enhance  financial  stability  and  confidence,  which  represents  a  key  prerequisite  for \nfinancial  inclusion.  The  program  will  also  support  the  finalization  of  draft  laws  and  lay  the \nfoundation for strengthening financial system infrastructure.  Combined with substantial TA, the \nprogram  will  also  support  capacity  development  for  the  relevant  executing  and  implementing \nagencies.  A  medium-term  agenda  and  expected  results  framework  will  be  used  to  continue \nADB\u2019s  engagement,  assess  program  effectiveness,  and  provide  an  eventual  pivot  into  wider \nfinancial inclusion efforts to supplement those of the government. \n \nEconomic impact. The program is designed to increase financial inclusion and support \n17. \nto  expand  the  financial  services.  The  economic  gains  from  this  program  will  be  achieved  by  \n(i)  capturing  efficiency  gains  in  banking  through  a  2%  reduction  in  net  interest  spreads  and  a \nreduction in the cost of credits, and (ii) increasing credit availability to microfinance institutions \nby shifting lending activity from the informal sector to the formal sector (para 29). \n \nB. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  the  banking  and  financial  sectors  enhanced.  The \n18. \noutcome  will  be  a  growing,  resilient,  inclusive,  and  efficient  financial  system  with  expanded \ncoverage. The Program will include a series of policy reforms and interventions and is designed \nto  deliver  three  outputs.  Subprogram  1  contains  15  policy  actions,  all  of  which  have  been \naccomplished. Subprogram 2 contains 15 policy actions, of which 8 actions are prior expected \nactions (triggers), and subprogram 3 contains 14 policy actions, of which 8 are triggers. \n \nC. \n \n19.   Output  1:  Access  to  formal  financial  services  to the  poor  expanded.  Output 1 will \npromote wider and more inclusive participation in the financial sector and establish a framework \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ninclusion \n\nto  ensure  adequate  consumer  protection.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  1  included:  \n(i)  an  interministerial  working  group  launched  a  nationwide  diagnostic  demand  survey  of \nfinancial \nthe  government \nin  Cambodia  with  gender-disaggregated  data;  (ii) \nrestructured the RDB, improved RDB\u2019s governance, and provided capital support of $26 million; \n(iii)  a  draft  Consumer  Protection  Law  was  completed  and  the  government  established  a \nconsumer protection unit at the NBC which launched a financial education campaign targeting \nyoung  people  aged  15\u201330  with  trainings  and  workshops,  and  (iv)  the  national  consultation  on \nthe credit guarantee scheme for SMEs was completed with an emphasis on the participation of \nfemale entrepreneurs. \n \n20. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  submit  the  proposed  national  strategy  for \nfinancial  inclusion  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  for  adoption,  with  specific  targets  to  support \nfinancial  inclusion  of  female  clients.  A  forum  on  financial  inclusion  will  be  developed  and  the \ngovernment  will  submit  the  proposed  Consumer  Protection  Law  to  the  National  Assembly  for \napproval.  The  credit  guarantee  scheme  for  SMEs  will  be  finalized.  Under  subprogram  3,  the \ngovernment will launch the national strategy for financial inclusion and monitor implementation, \nincluding  collection  of  gender-disaggregated  data.  The  government  will  implement  the \nConsumer Protection Law and establish an enforcement framework. The RDB will begin offering \nwholesale  banking  services  to  microfinance  institutions,  including  agriculture  cooperatives. \nImplementation of the SME credit guarantee scheme will continue, supported by the collection \nof gender-disaggregated data. \n\n \n21. \nOutput  2:  Financial  sector  stability  enhanced. Output 2 will increase financial sector \nstability, enlarge and deepen bank and nonbank finance, and increase and diversify the level of \nfinancial products available to the public. Accomplishments under subprogram 1 included: (i) the \ngovernment  strengthened  cross-sector  supervision  and  improved  information-sharing  between \nsupervisors, (ii) the Law on Insurance was approved along with a legal framework to support the \nintroduction  of  microinsurance,  (iii)  studies  were  completed  to  support  the  development  of  a \ndeposit  protection  scheme  (DPS),  and  (iv) to  improve the  liquidity  of  the  interbank market, the \ngovernment introduced measures to increase issuance of the Negotiable Certificate of Deposits. \n\n \n22. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  establish  a  joint  financial  stability  technical \ngroup  and update its public debt management strategy 2019\u20132023 to incorporate the potential  \nissuance of government debt securities. Implementation plans for a DPS and the introduction of \nmicroinsurance  will  also  be  completed.  Under  subprogram  3,  the  government  will  establish  a \nnational financial stability committee and complete a draft law to anchor the establishment of a \nDPS. The government will authorize and license microinsurance operators and will formulate a \nplan to develop a government debt market. \n\n \n23. \nOutput  3:  Financial  sector  infrastructure  upgraded.  Output  3  will  support the  wider \ndevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  by  upgrading  financial  infrastructure  and  encouraging  the \ndevelopment  of  a  wider  array  of  financial  products  and  services.  Accomplishments  under \nsubprogram  1  included:  (i)  the  government  launched  \u201cfast  payment\u201d  as  an  alternative  retail \nchannel  for  local  currency  fund  transfer,  (ii)  the  draft  Comprehensive  Trust  Law  was  finalized \nand authorization was obtained to establish an e-Commerce Law, and (iii) coverage of the credit \ninformation database was expanded. \n\n \n24. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  establish  a  shared  switch  system.  The \nproposed  e-Commerce  and  Comprehensive  Trust  Laws  will  be  submitted  to  the  National \nAssembly  for  approval.  The  coverage  of  the  credit  information  database  will  be  further \nexpanded  and  compliance  with  anti-money-laundering  protocols  will  be  strengthened.  Under \n\n \n\n\fsubprogram  3,  the  government  will  launch  a  project  to  establish  an  RTGS  system.  Payment \nsystem  infrastructure  will  be  upgraded  to  facilitate  the  introduction  of  e-commerce  and \npayments. New financial products will be created under the trust scheme to enhance resource \nmobilization  and  the  government  will  achieve  full  compliance  with  the  Financial  Action  Task \nForce standards. \n\nloan \n\nrequested  a \n\nThe  government  has \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nin  various  currencies  equivalent \n\nD. \n \nto  \n25. \nSDR28,529,000 from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help finance  subprogram  1. The  loan \nwill have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  ADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan \nproceeds  and to  verify  the  accuracy  of  withdrawal  application certification. The  closing  date of \nthe loan is 30 June 2017, by which date all proceeds of the loan will have been fully disbursed. \nThe  loan for subprogram  1  will  be  withdrawn  in  a single tranche  upon  loan  effectiveness. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n26. \nThe size of the program is based on (i) the government\u2019s development financing needs \nas identified during country programming and strategy formulation, (ii) the development impact \nof  the  policy  reform  package,  and  (iii)  the  development  spending  arising  from  the  reform. The \ngovernment  will  support the  reforms  through budget  allocations  such as  recapitalization of the \nRDB,  and  upgrading  bank  payment  and  settlement  system.  In  2016,  the  budget  deficit  is \nexpected  to  be  $843  million,  or  4.3%  of  GDP,  and  will  be  financed  primarily  by  official \ndevelopment assistance. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe  NBC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  MEF,  MOC,  and  SECC  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  A  financial  sector  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  governor  of  the \nNBC with implementing agencies as members, will oversee the implementation of the program. \nThe  steering  committee  will  be  supported  by  a  technical  working  group,  also  chaired  by  the \nNBC.  The  implementation  period  of  subprogram  1  is  from  30  June  2014  to  30  June  2016, \nsubprogram  2  implementation  is  from  30  June  2016  to  30  June  2018,  and  for  subprogram  3, \nimplementation is from 30 June 2018 to 30 June 2020. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n28. \nIn  response  to  the  government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  prepared  the  Implementing  the \nInclusive Financial Sector Development Program TA to support the implementation of key policy \ntriggers  under  subprogram  2,  as  well  as  provide  the  government  with  timely  policy  advice  on \ndemand. The TA is estimated to cost $0.68 million, of which $0.60 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The implementing agencies \n(MEF,  MOC,  NBC,  and  SECC)  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, support facilities, and other in-kind contributions. A total of 23 person-months \nof consulting inputs are required (15 international and 8 national). ADB will engage a firm on a \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  basis  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The NBC \nwill be the executing agency of the TA, and the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the implementing \nagencies with implementation period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n The  results  of  the  PIA  indicate  that  the  program  could  produce  potential  gains  to  the \n29. \neconomy  amounting  to  $391.2  million  annually  or  2.3%  of  GDP.  These  gains  arise  primarily \nfrom two channels. First, the program will increase the average annual volume of banking loans \nwhich, when combined with the expected reduction in interest margins, will add $230.1 million to \nGDP  annually.  In  addition,  reforms  under  the  program  will  help  reduce  interest  margins  in  the \nmicrofinance  sector  by  at  least  by  6.0%  which,  along  with  increased  lending  and  deposit \nmobilization, will shift borrowers out of more expensive informal lending schemes. This channel \ncould  add  as  much  as  $161.1  million  to  GDP  annually.  These  estimates  ignore  potentially \nlarger,  second-round  effects  such  as increased  investment  arising from  increased  mobilization \nof  savings  and  the  lower  cost  of  capital,  and  increased  employment  within  and  outside  of  the \nsector. The benefits from the proposed reforms exceeded the investment costs of $140 million \nand the recurrent costs of $5 million.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nthe  MEF,  has  strengthened  budget  credibility  and \n\nB. \n \n30. \nA  review  of  the  country\u2019s  public  financial  management  systems  was  carried  out  to \nunderstand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements. Implementation of \npublic  financial  management  reforms,  through  the  implementation  of  financial  management \ninformation  systems  at \nfinancial \naccountability. 12  The  assessment  also  considered  ADB\u2019s  report  on  Cambodia\u2019s  country \ngovernance risk assessment and risk management plan,13 and the public expenditure financial \naccountability  report. 14  Nonetheless,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  government  commitment  is \ninsufficient to support successful and sustainable reforms.  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and transparency,  the  government  will  continue  its  efforts  to  institute,  maintain, \nand  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  on \nissues such as corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n32. \nThe  program  is  categorized  as  a  general  intervention  to  support  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and it is expected to indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. Further, the promotion of \ninclusive finance facilitated by financial sector development expands the outreach of affordable \nformal  financial  services  to  poor  and  rural  microenterprises,  and  so  has  direct  impacts  on \npoverty  reduction.  Subprogram  1  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements.  Financial \nsector  reforms based  on  market  principles  are  typically  gender  neutral.  However,  the  program \nhas improved access to financial services, bringing more benefits to women in rural areas.  \n \n \n\n                                                \n12  External  Advisory  Panel.  2015.

These  risks  are  managed  through  program \ndesign  and  the  utilization  of  TA.  A  comprehensive  discussion  of  program  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  is  contained  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.16 With  the  design \nsafeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh any costs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe  government  and  the  NBC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  detail  in  the  loan  agreement.
