Two such services are trade finance and supply chain \nfinance (SCF). To respond to the high but unmet demand for these services, ADB established \nthe Trade Finance Program2 (TFP), which provides guarantees and loans to banks to facilitate \ncross-border trade, and is now seeking to set up a program that would supply guarantees and \nfunding for domestic and international SCF transactions. The program aims to broaden access \nto  working  capital  for  DMC  companies,  and  thereby  facilitate  business  expansion  and  job \ncreation, the ultimate drivers of economic growth and poverty alleviation. \n\n \n3. \nThere  are  three  primary  participants  in  a  supply  chain  of  producing  and  distributing \ngoods: (i) an \u2015anchor\u2016, which may act as either a buyer or a seller of manufactured goods and is \ntypically a large corporate entity; (ii) a supplier, which produces and ships manufactured goods \nto  the  anchor;  and  (iii)  a  distributor,  which  buys  manufactured  goods  from  the  anchor  for \nonselling to retailers.  Under the program, it is anticipated that most (but not all) anchors will be \ndomiciled  in  a  developed  country  and  that  most  suppliers  and  distributors  will  be  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) located in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n\n \n4. \nThere  are  three  main  SCF  products:  (i)  post-shipment  or  post-acceptance  finance,  in \nwhich  the  supplier  ships  goods  that  are  accepted  by  the  corporate  anchor,  who  in  turn \nacknowledges its obligation to pay by a specific date, at which point a financial institution pays \nthe supplier, followed by direct payment by the anchor to the financial institution on the specified \nfuture  date;  (ii)  pre-shipment  or  pre-acceptance  finance,  where  financing  is  provided  before \ngoods are accepted by the anchor, and in some cases even before shipment takes place; and \n(iii)  distributor  finance,  where  financing  for  downstream  distributors  is  provided  to  cover  the \nbusiness cycle, or the time it takes the distributor to sell and be paid for goods purchased from \nan anchor. The following diagram illustrates a basic supply chain. A description of each product \nand attendant risk parameters is in Supply Chain Finance Products and Their Risk Parameters.3 \nAlso see Diagram of Post-Shipment or Post-Acceptance Supply Chain Finance Program on how \npost-shipment or post-acceptance SCF works.4 \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2012.

Under the current system, cash flow for working capital is trapped in the supply chain, \ninhibiting the ability of DMC companies to expand and create more jobs. For example, having to \nwait  30\u2013180  days  post-shipment  for  payment  may  mean  having  to  shut  down  operations  and \ndelaying the processing (or acquisition) of other contracts in the meantime.  Receiving cash flow \neven just 30 days earlier  could make a substantial difference\u2014DMC companies would have a \nsteady  flow  of  working  capital  to  maintain  production  capacity,  retain  staff,  and  ultimately \nexpand operations and employ more people. \n \nThis  suboptimal  financial  supply  chain  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  ongoing  global \n6. \neconomic  downturn. Tighter credit  conditions  have resulted  in anchors  putting more  and more \npressure  on  suppliers  to  extend  payment  terms  and  distributors  to  shorten  payment  terms, \nwhich  in  turn  has  made  business  expansion  exceedingly  difficult  or  impossible.  Razor-thin \nmargins  also  make  it  harder  to  accommodate  further  requests  to  extend  payment  terms. 5  \nWithout  better  access  to  working  capital,  suppliers  and  buyers  are  at  risk  of  losing  trade \ncontracts, and generally have less cash flow available to expand operations and create jobs.  \n \nThe  program  aims  to  offer  an  efficient  means  of  managing  financial  supply  chains  that \n7. \nwould  improve  access  to  affordable  working  capital,  and  in  some  cases  provide  access  to \nfinance for companies in DMCs that would otherwise not be considered \u2015bankable\u2016. One of the \nkey features of the program, at least as it relates to post-shipment or post-acceptance finance, \nis that trade receivables are discounted based on the anchor\u2019s credit rating, as opposed to the \nsupplier\u2019s.  For  this  reason,  the  program  can  provide  DMC  suppliers  with  a  cheaper  source  of \nworking capital, and earlier than would otherwise be the case. \n \nSCF  is  a  relatively  new  trade  service  and  few  providers  of  such  services  are  in  the \n8. \nmarket. The scarcity of market participants is further compounded by the limited  scope of their \nSCF  programs,  mainly  due  to  (i)  tight  capital  positions\u2014the  result  of  deleveraging,  more \nstringent regulatory requirements, and higher capital requirements for banks; (ii) slow uptake of \nthe  new  approach  to  assessing  risk,  which  focuses  on  the  strength  of  a  supply  chain \n\n                                                \n5  Demica. 2009.

(April). \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nrelationship (i.e., supplier\u2013anchor,  anchor\u2013distributor)  rather  than financials  and  collateral;  and \n(iii) high costs of developing information technology (IT) infrastructure to support SCF services. \n \n9. \nThe  program  aims  to  boost  PFIs\u2019  capital  and  risk-bearing  capacity,  thereby  furthering \ntheir ability to be more active in providing SCF to suppliers and distributors in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The \nprogram  would  provide  additional  resources  for  SCF  to  support  DMC  companies.  The  TFP  is \nincreasingly  called  on  to  provide  more  support  to  fill  widening  financing  gaps.  To  support  job \ncreation in DMCs and, ultimately, sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in DMCs, \nit  is  important that  ADB now  lend  its  capacity  to filling market gaps for  SCF. The  program  will \nenable  ADB  to  unlock  financial  resources  caught  in  the  supply  chain.  These  resources  will \nsupport  domestic  and  cross-border  transactions  for  the  benefit  of  private  sector  development, \nSMEs, and job creation. \n \nB. \n\nProgram Description \n\n10. \nThis will be ADB\u2019s first SCF program. It entails the provision of guarantees to and debt \nfinancing (both without a government guarantee) through PFIs to support payments throughout \nthe  supply  chain,  and  will  (i)  enable  companies  traditionally  not  deemed  bankable  to  receive \nfinance,  (ii) improve  cash  flow  to  enable  growth  and  job  creation,  and  (iii)  encourage  more \nfinancial institutions to develop and broaden SCF. \n \n11. \nADB will provide partial guarantees to and debt financing through PFIs that offer SCF to \nsuppliers  and  distributors  in  ADB's  DMCs  of  up  to  $200,000,000  at  any  time.  Such  financing \nsupport will be on a rolling basis. Guarantees would  be provided to PFIs and cover the risk of \nnonpayment  by  an  obligor,  which  may  be  a  supplier,  a  distributor,  or  an  anchor.  Therefore, \nunder these guarantees, ADB\u2019s payment obligations will arise upon nonpayment of the supplier, \nanchor,  or  distributor  obligation.  Under  the  proposed  debt-financing  arrangements,  ADB  will \nadvance short-term loans through PFIs to DMC  suppliers and distributors. These loans will be \nmatched in equal or greater amounts by the PFI to the same borrower. A payment default to the \nPFI  would  give  rise to  a  pass-through  nonpayment  of  ADB\u2019s  debt  service.  ADB  would  rely  on \nthe  recovery  process  of  the  PFI  for  recourse  against  any  defaulting  party.  Any  amounts \nrecovered would be shared on a pro rata basis. In contrast to the TFP, ADB will not take credit \nrisk on the PFI, but on the parties to the underlying supply transactions. \n \n12. \nDifferent  FIs  have  different  SCF  product  capabilities,  largely  distinguished  by  an \nindividual  FI\u2019s  risk  appetite,  presence  in  DMCs,  and  monitoring  capabilities.  ADB  will  select \nsuitable  PFIs  and  determine  which  SCF  products  would  be  appropriate  for  ADB  participation \nwith a  particular  PFI.  Assessment  of  an  individual  PFI\u2019s  suitability  per  SCF product  will  largely \nbe  based  on  its  alignment  with  eligibility  criteria  for  SCF  products  provided  in  Supply  Chain \nFinance Products and Their Risk Parameters (footnote 3) and on the PFI\u2019s capability to assess \nand monitor transactions under a particular SCF product portfolio. The scope of the  program\u2019s \nengagement with a PFI will be tailored to that PFI\u2019s capabilities. \n \n13. \nThe  program  will  be  regional  and  aims  to  encompass  as  many  DMCs  as  possible, \nincluding  those  benefiting from  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources.  However,  it  should \nbe  noted  that  most  SCF  flows  occur  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  Indonesia,  Sri \nLanka, and Viet Nam. While ADB will make every effort to diversify its geographic exposure and \nsupport, the program will nonetheless be linked to where PFIs have SCF exposure. \n \n14. \nA  related  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  program  may  be  proposed  to  develop  ADF \nDMC  markets  for  more  SCF  engagement.  DMC  companies  have  limited  familiarity  with  SCF \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\n \n\nand its IT requirements, and an SCF TA targeted to ADF DMC companies may be important to \nenable  geographic  diversification  of  the  program.  Rather  than  implementing  related  TA  at  this \npoint, it would be more prudent to do so after some experience in operating the program, which \nwill allow better tailoring and targeting of any TA. \n \nC. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n15. \nA survey of over 20 banks and due diligence for this program confirmed unmet demand \nfor  SCF  and  requests  for  ADB  partnership  to  help  fill  the  gap.  There  are  no  specific  figures \nquantifying  the  gap,  but  the  anecdotal  evidence  is  compelling.    Requests  from  potential  PFIs \nexceed the proposed $200,000,000 program amount by more than three times. \n \n16. \nThe program will further ADB\u2019s ability to support private sector growth, especially among \nDMC companies and more particularly SMEs. ADB has made substantial progress in supporting \ntrade  through  the  TFP,  but  this  is  limited  to  assuming  bank  risk  for  cross-border  transactions. \nThe program will complement the TFP by assuming nonbank commercial risks for both cross-\nborder and domestic transactions.6 \n \n17. \nStrategically,  the  two  programs  are  an  excellent  fit,  being  complementary  but  distinct. \nADB  has  no  experience  in  SCF  and,  while  it  is  an  excellent  strategic  and  \u2015developmental\u2016 \ncomplement to the TFP, SCF risk is considerably different. ADB does not yet have the expertise \nor  human  resources  to  provide  the  significant  TA  and  monitoring  that  would  be  required  to \nsupport the  start-up of  a  commercial  bank\u2019s  SCF  program.  Therefore,  it  is  proposed that  ADB \nenter this market prudently, extending its involvement over time as its knowledge, expertise, and \nexperience  in  SCF  become  substantial.  Furthermore,  it  is  proposed  that  the  program  initially \nprovide support through PFIs that already have well-established SCF portfolios. ADB should try \nto start with the post-acceptance SCF product before moving into other products. Moreover, the \nprogram  would benefit from  the  experience and relationships  that  ADB  developed  through  the \nTFP, and SCF partnerships should be structured along similar lines. \n \n18. \nDuring  the  program,  ADB  will  evaluate  whether  changes  to  the  structure  and  other \nparameters  should  be  contemplated  to  ensure  maximum  development  impact  and  success. \nComplementary TA will also be considered during the review, if not sooner. \n  \nD. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \nADB will seek to include in the program as many PFIs as practicable. Prospective PFIs \n19. \nwill be evaluated based on high standards of corporate governance and integrity, management \ncaliber,  financial  soundness,  and  operational  capability.  ADB  will  take  into  consideration  the \nquality  of  the  prospective  PFI\u2019s  existing  SCF  portfolio  as  well  as  its  procedures  for  assessing \nand  mitigating  risk  (including  environmental  and  social  risk)  and  such  policies  and  procedures \nas pertain to due diligence and evaluation of suppliers, anchors, and distributors. \n \n20.  While ADB will not assume credit risk on PFIs, it  will assume some operational risk on \nPFIs and will therefore consider their overall credit standing, which takes account of operational \nand due diligence capabilities. As such, ADB will target PFIs with international or local ratings of \n\n                                                \n6  Comparison  Between  Trade  Finance  Program  and  Supply  Chain  Finance  Program  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nA\u2013  or  better.7 Eligible  PFIs  will  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Investment  Committee,  which  will  take \ninto consideration all parameters mentioned above. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nA. \n \n21. \nUnder the program, ADB will provide guarantees to and debt financing through PFIs that \noffer  SCF  to  suppliers  and  distributors  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  It  is  proposed  that  the  program \nterminate  after  5  years  and  that,  in  any  case,  all  ADB\u2019s  obligations  and  liabilities  under  the \nprogram  be  discharged  by  31  August  2018.  Financing  of  all  forms  under  the  program  will  not  \nexceed  $200,000,000  at  any  time  and  will  be  provided  on  a rolling  basis.  PFIs  will  assume  at \nleast an equal amount of risk to ADB under the program. \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nB. \n\nReporting  arrangements.  ADB  will  administer  the  program  along  the  lines  that  are \n22. \nalready  familiar  under  the  TFP.  PFIs  will  be  required  to  provide  ADB  with  regular,  at  least \nquarterly,  information  about  its  SCF  portfolio,  including  beneficiaries,  country  exposures  and \nconcentrations, as well as reporting  on any delinquent payments. PFIs will also be required to \nprovide ADB with statistics to assess the development impact. ADB will review this information \nand monitor the program continuously. \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nValue  proposition  and  imperative.  SCF  is  a  unique  and  important  vehicle  through \n23. \nwhich to support DMC companies, and holds potential for significant development impact. SCF \novercomes  the  two  greatest  impediments  to  financial  support  for  DMC  companies,  including \nSMEs:  weak  financials  and  lack  of  collateral.  Unlike  standard  risk  assessments  that  focus  on \ncredit assessment and collateral, SCF risk assessment focuses on the strength, longevity, and \n\u2015stickiness\u2016  (mutual  dependence)  of  relationships  in  a  supply  chain.  It  is  the  relationship \nbetween  an  anchor  and  a  supplier  (usually  a  DMC  SME)  that  is  of  primary  concern,  not \nfinancials  and  collateral.  SCF  represents  a  somewhat  revolutionary  paradigm  through  which \nADB can support SMEs not normally considered \u2015bankable\u2016. \n \n24. \nAnother  major  value  of SCF is that  it  provides  the  cash flow  required for  companies  to \ngrow  and  create more jobs.  Suppliers may  have  enough  working  capital  to  produce goods for \none or two shipments, but then need to scale down operations until they receive payment from \nan anchor, typically between 30 and 180 days after shipment. SCF provides cash to suppliers \nearlier,  allowing  them  to  fill  multiple  contracts  at  the  same  time  and  thereby  enabling  them  to \ngrow  their  business,  which  requires  more  staff.  As  such,  SCF  can  become  an  important \nmechanism to underpin economic growth and job creation. \n \n25. \nCapital  resources  are  tight  for  many  financial  institutions,  resulting  in  fewer  financial \nresources  to  support  DMC  companies,  especially  SMEs.  Less  leverage  (which  is  the  \u2015new \nnormal\u2016),  more  stringent  regulatory  requirements,  the  sovereign  debt  crisis  in  Europe,  and \npressure  to  hold  more  capital  are  all  contributing  to  these  conditions.  When  capital  is  tight, \nfinancial institutions focus on core products for core clients (not DMC companies and SMEs) in \nprimary markets (which most DMCs are not). It is here that the program will provide additional \n\n                                                \n7  Financial,  including  nonbank, institutions  that  are  rated  below  A\u2013  may still be  eligible  if  they  broadly meet  ADB\u2019s \n\nother requirements as a potential PFI. If no international or local rating is available, ADB may assign one. \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\n \n\nsupport to DMC companies. PFIs will use ADB resources to leverage their own to support more \nSCF activity in DMCs. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s strong credit standing\u2014AAA-rated guarantees lower \nthe  financial  institutions'  risk-weighted  assets  against  capital  requirements\u2014makes  it  a  highly \ndesirable  partner  for  financial  institutions  with  SCF  skills  and  existing  portfolios,  and  high \ndemand  for  the  program  is  anticipated.  The  TFP  is  increasingly  called  on  to  provide  more \nsupport  to  fill  widening  gaps.  Likewise,  ADB  could  lend  its  capacity  to  support  supply  chain \nfinancing, a new area with significant potential to support economic growth and jobs in DMCs. \n \nValue added. Capital alleviation and risk sharing from ADB under the program will boost \n26. \nthe risk-bearing capacity of PFIs and make more funds available for SCF, to the benefit of more \nDMC companies, particularly SMEs. To ensure additionality, the potential PFIs that ADB has so \nfar approached have indicated their willingness (as a condition for participating in the program) \nto agree to an SCF baseline with targeted annual increases in the number of DMC companies \nthat  will  access  SCF.  ADB  will  thus  ensure  that  (i)  the  program  serves  to  benefit  parties  that \nwould  otherwise  not  be  part  of  a  PFI\u2019s  standard  SCF  portfolio,  and  (ii)  the  PFIs  themselves \ncommit to a formal policy of expanding their SCF portfolios. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n \n27. \nThe  program  entails  the  provision  of  guarantees  and  debt  financing  through  PFIs  to \nsupport  payments  throughout  the  supply  chain,  and  thus  will  assume  risk  on  anchors,  DMC \nsuppliers,  and  DMC  distributors.  In  all  cases  under  the  program,  a  PFI\u2019s  risk  will  be  at  least \nequal to ADB\u2019s. \n \nSCF is a relatively low-risk way to support SMEs and other DMC companies. There are \n28. \nthree  primary  reasons for  this:   (i)  Unlike  conventional  risk  assessments focused  on financials \nand collateral, which provide a narrow and relatively limited or isolated assessment of risk, SCF \ntakes a \u2015holistic\u2016 approach, providing a broader perspective on the history and future of a DMC \ncompany\u2019s (SME\u2019s) ability to perform and meet obligations based on its continuing performance \nin  supplying  to  anchors.  (ii) Unlike  financial  statement  analysis  (which  reports  after  the  fact), \nSCF  risk  monitoring  can  be  pre-emptive.  Quarterly  and  annual  discussions  with  suppliers  and \nanchors  can  inform  a  PFI  of  warning  signs,  such  as  an  anticipated  slow-down  in  orders  or \nvarious  performance  issues.  Traditional  risk  assessments  focused  on  statements  would  not \nrecognize  these  issues  until  it  might  be  too  late  to  exit  or  restructure.  (iii)  In  the  case  of \ndistributor finance, the anchor and the PFI agree to a \u2015stop supply\u2016 clause; this gives the PFI the \nright  to  stop  an  anchor  from  selling  goods  to  a  distributor  in  the  event  of  nonpayment  and \nprovides a substantial disincentive to avoid meeting obligations, since distributors would go out \nof business without supply from the anchor. \n \nThe  degree  of  risk  under  an  SCF  transaction  depends  on  when  support  is  provided  in \n29. \nthe  supply  chain.  For  example,  if  a  financial  institution  provides  post-shipment  and  post-\nacceptance finance, its risk on the supplier is negligible. If, however, it extends financing before \nshipment, it assumes both a supplier and an anchor risk. \n \n30. \nThe list of risks associated with each SCF product, and eligibility criteria that will broadly \nbe  required for  ADB  support,  is  in  Supply  Chain Finance  Products  and Their  Risk  Parameters \n(footnote 3). \n \n31. \nwith ADB on a pro-rata basis. \n\nPFIs will be responsible for recoveries under any defaults. All recoveries will be shared \n\n\f \n\n \n32. \n \n\nProgram Risks contains a detailed list of risks.8 \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nThe ultimate development impact of the program will be broader access to SCF, in that \n33. \nthe number of DMC companies with access to supply chain financing increases by at least 25% \nby 2020, compared with the 2012 industry baseline, which is expected to serve as a catalyst for \ntrade-related economic growth in developing Asia. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n34. \nThe  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  a  broadening  of  PFIs\u2019  SCF  portfolios  with  the \nprovision of up to $500,000,000 (ADB\u2019s participation: $200,000,000) in SCF on a rolling basis to \nDMC companies between 2013 and 2018. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n 35. \nThe  key  output  will  be  the  establishment  of  ADB\u2019s  SCF  program  for  the  purpose  of \nimproving  DMC  companies'  access  to  working  capital.  Related  output  indicators  include \nenrollment  of  four  PFIs  by  2015,  and  a  15%  increase  in  the  number  of  DMC  companies \nsupported  by  PFI  supply  chain  financing  by  2017.  The  potential  PFIs  that  ADB  has  thus  far \napproached  have  indicated  their  willingness  (as  a  condition  of  participating  in the  program)  to \nagree to an SCF baseline with targeted annual increases in the number of DMC companies that \nwill access supply chain financing. Baseline and target figures will be finalized when signing the \nagreements with PFIs. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n36. \nUnder  Strategy  2020,  ADB  will  strengthen  its  support  to  the  finance  sector,  both \nregionally  and  nationally,  by  helping  develop  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products \nand services, and by promoting inclusive growth.9 Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to \nassist in channeling the region's savings into the most productive investments, and to build the \ncapacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The  proposed \ninvestment  supports  institutional  development  and  helps  deepen  the  finance  sector  by \nexpanding financial resources to support SMEs, economic growth, and job creation. It will also \nhave a demonstration effect on non-partner financial institutions that are not yet providing SCF. \n   \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nSupporting  finance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  development  assistance  for \n37. \nADB, in line with the tenets detailed in its strategies for private sector development10 and poverty \n\n                                                \n8  Program Risks (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n9  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n10 ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy.

The latter states that ADB seeks to promote \u2015sound and efficient banking systems \nand  capital  markets,\u2016  since  these  are  seen  as  \u2015indispensable  for  macroeconomic  stability, \nmobilizing savings, and ensuring the availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement \nfor pro-poor growth\u2016 (footnote 11). The Private Sector Development Strategy refers specifically \nto ADB's role in strengthening the finance sector for the benefit of DMCs. Thus, this program is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  overall  finance  sector  strategy,  as  it  will  assist  the  development  of  a \ncritical component of the sector\u2019s much-needed support for SMEs in DMCs. \n \nThe program will be aligned with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, especially for \n38. \nfinancial  inclusion,12 and  enable  ADB  to  provide  support  to  SMEs  not  traditionally  considered \n\u2015bankable\u2016.  While the TFP fills a market gap, its reach is limited to supporting transactions that \ninvolve  bank  risk.  The  program,  which  assumes  nonbank  risk,  will  complement  the  TFP  by \nrounding off ADB\u2019s range of products in support of DMC companies' domestic and cross-border \ntransactions.  The  program  also  exemplifies  ADB\u2019s  holistic  approach  to  creating  private  sector \neconomic  growth  and  job  creation.  ADB  will  leverage  off  its  success  in  structuring  and \nimplementing the TFP to apply lessons learned to the program. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n39. \nThe  proposed  investment  is  classified  as  FI  (treated  as  category  C)  for  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  The  program  will  involve  primarily  guarantees  and  debt  financing  of  small  loans  for \ntransactions  in  a  supply  chain  each  with  insignificant  environmental  impact.  The  project  team \nwill  review  prospective  PFIs\u2019  environmental  and  social  management  systems.  It  is  recognized \nthat  certain  industry  sectors  such  as  garments,  which  may  be  supported  under  the  program, \nmay pose heightened environmental risks. ADB will ensure during due diligence that such risks \nare  properly  assessed  and  managed  by  potential  PFIs.  The  project  team  will  also  review  and \nassess  potential  gender  benefits  of  the  program,  which  could  be  quite  positive  and  relevant, \nespecially as the garment sector is likely to feature prominently in the program. Furthermore, the \nfeasibility of prospective PFIs' mechanisms to monitor compliance with national labor laws and \ninternationally  recognized  labor  standards  will  be  an  important  consideration  when  selecting \nPFIs.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nEach PFI would be advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice in \n40. \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  financing  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  program  is  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  investment \n\n41. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2004.
