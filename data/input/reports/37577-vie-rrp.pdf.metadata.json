Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse environmental impacts identified. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  Viet  Nam's \nfinancial  sector  strategy  since  1996  through  program  loans  that \nhelped  the  Government  articulate  a  vision  of  a  modern  broad-\nbased financial sector with strong intermediaries, well-functioning \nmarkets,  and  legal  and  regulatory  infrastructure  that  promotes \nstability.  The  strategy  envisions  the  need  to  address  core  issues \nincluding  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and \nbuilding institutional capacities over the long term. \n \nWhile the initial focus of ADB support was to strengthen the legal \nframework \nfocus  since  has  been  on \ndeveloping  a  wider  range  of  legal  and  regulatory  structures  that \ncan underpin development of broad-based financial markets. \n \nFinancial  sector  development  is  central  to  continuing  Viet  Nam's \ngrowth momentum. The Government's strategy for sustaining high \ngrowth relies on attaining high investment of as much as 40% of \ninvestment.  While \ngross  domestic  product, \ndomestic savings rates are high and likely to continue to rise given \nfavorable  demographics,  and  foreign  direct  investment  into  the \neconomy  is  increasing,  the  ability  to  sustain  the  targeted  high \nintermediation  and \ngrowth  will \nimproved  efficiency  of  resource  allocation.  The  banking  system, \nwhich still dominates the financial sector, is limited in its ability to \nprudently \nlong-term \nfinancing  of  investment.  There  is  a  need,  therefore,  to  foster  a \ndiversified financial sector in Viet Nam to support sustainable high \ninvestment and growth by developing the nonbank financial sector \nthrough improved capital markets. \n \n\nfor  banking,  greater \n\nincluding  public \n\nits  short-term \n\nincreased \n\ntransform \n\nliabilities \n\nfinancial \n\nrequire \n\ninto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and Tranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\nFSPL  III  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government's  new  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (SEDP),  approved  in \n2006,  which  not  only  targets  middle-income  status  by  2010  but \nalso envisages industrial country status for Viet Nam by 2020. To \nachieve these goals the SEDP strongly emphasizes the objectives \nof  business  development,  private  investment,  and  a  continuing \ntransition  to  a  market-based  system  with  greater  integration  with \nthe  global  economy.  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  for \n2007\u20132010 is congruent with the Government's SEDP, supporting \nbusiness-led  pro-poor  growth  through  promoting  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  a  business-enabling  environment,  and  financial \nintermediation. \n \n \nThe  objective  of  FSPL  III  is  to create  a  more  diversified,  deeper, \nand  more  resilient  financial  sector.  The  bank-dominated  financial \nsector  cannot  adequately  finance  the  economy\u2019s  investment \nneeds. FSPL III will lead to an increased share of capital markets \nin  the  financing  of  domestic  investment,  which  will  promote  and \nfacilitate sustained high growth in the economy with reduced risks. \nDevelopment of diversified capital markets will result in increased \nefficiency  of  financial  intermediation  in  the  economy,  more \nefficient  allocation  of  resources,  and  a  sound  macroeconomic \nenvironment that is more resilient to external and regional shocks. \nFSPL  III  will  also  support  Government  efforts  to  promote  greater \nregional cooperation through cooperation with regulators of other \nsecurities markets in the region. \n \nA  loan  of  $75,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  will  be  provided  for  subprogram  1  of  the  program \ncluster. The loan will have an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n \nThe implementation period for the program cluster is from January \n2006  to  September  2010;  subprogram  1  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted  14  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  for \nsubprogram  1  will  be  released  in  two  tranches:  SDR  19,116,000 \nupon  fulfillment  of  specified  first  tranche  release  conditions,  and \nSDR 28,674,000 subject to fulfillment of specified second tranche \nrelease  conditions.  Subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board \nconsideration  approximately  30  months  after  the  effectiveness  of \nsubprogram  1,  subject  to  adequate  progress  of  reforms  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures \nand associated costs of reform and to help maintain current social \nexpenditure. \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nimplementation, \n\nfor  overall  program \n\n \nState Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  including  the  State  Securities \nCommission (SSC), will be the Implementing Agency. SBV will be \nresponsible \nincluding \nadministration  and  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  maintenance \nof  accounts,  and  preparation  of  semiannual  progress  reports  on \nprogram  implementation.  To  coordinate  program  implementation \namong  different  Government  agencies  concerned,  a  program \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  formed.  The  PSC,  chaired  by \nSBV,  will  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  government  agencies \nconcerned, including SBV, MOF, and SSC. The PSC will meet on \na  semiannual  and  ad  hoc  basis  to  review  pending  issues  and \npropose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to  ensure  timely \nprogram implementation. SBV will form a program implementation \nand  coordination  unit,  headed  by  a  senior  SBV  officer,  to  assist \nthe PSC and ADB and have responsibility for day-to-day program \nimplementation.  Reforms achieved under FSPL III, subprogram 1 \nhave been supported by close policy dialogue as well as technical \nassistance support. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance import costs (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  all  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans. \n \nDevelopment  of  capital  markets  and  a  diversified  financial  sector \nwill  help  mobilize  resources  and  allocate  them  efficiently.  The \nincreased financial intermediation will help Viet Nam achieve and \nsustain  its  ambitious  growth  program.  Well-developed  capital \nmarkets will provide government and private sector with access to \nmedium-  and  long-term  funds,  thus  enabling  a  wider  variety  of \nprojects  to  be  financed  in  the  economy.  They  will  also  provide \ncompetition to the banking system, thus contributing to increased \nefficiency  of  banking  and  of  the  financial  sector  as  a  whole. \nGovernment  debt  market  development  will  help  the  economy  by \nproviding  a benchmark  yield  curve  that  can  help  pricing  of other, \nriskier assets, and contribute to development of markets for such \nassets. Successful development of the shorter-term debt markets \nwill  help  increase  effectiveness  of  the  monetary  policy  and \nfacilitate improved monetary policy management. \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\nto  be \n\ninvestors, \n\nintroduced \n\ninsurance  products \n\nA  well-developed  financial  system  is  the  heart  of  a  modern, \nindustrialized economy. Consequently, benefits of FSPL III will be \nspread across all sectors of the economy. For example, improved \ninvestor  protection  in  securities  markets  will  benefit  large  as  well \nincluding  providing  households  with \nas  small \nmechanisms  to  invest  savings  safely.  Stronger  protection  for \nconsumers in insurance will benefit all consumers, while enabling \nnew \nthe  market. \nDevelopment  of  the  leasing  sector  will  provide  firms,  including \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  firms,  access  to  alternative  sources  of \nfinancing  for  their  capital  requirement.  Increased  access  to  long- \nand medium-term finance will benefit larger firms undertaking job-\ncreating  investment  projects  that  otherwise  may  not  be  viable. \nExperience  with  more  developed  securities  markets  will  enhance \nthe knowledge base and skills of investors and other participants \nin  financial  markets  to  better  benefit  from  integrating  global \nmarkets. \n \nFSPL  III  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government's  plans  for \ndeveloping  the  financial  sector,  particularly  securities  markets. \nNonetheless, program implementation is subject to potential risks: \n \n(i) \n\nExogenous, regional financial shock. The first risk is the \npossibility  of  a  large  exogenous  shock  in  the  form  of  a \nregional financial crisis. The economy is benefiting from its \ngrowing  integration  with  global  trade  and  financial  flows, \nbut  this  also  leaves  it  more  vulnerable  to  such  shocks. \nHowever, concerns at this stage are not regional per se but \nmore  related  to  global  imbalances  in  savings  between \nAsian countries and others, and spillover effects of crisis in \nthe  subprime  mortgage  lending  markets.  Viet  Nam,  for  its \npart,  has  a  very  sound  external  outlook  with  modest \ncurrent account deficits/surplus, an exchange rate that is a \nmanaged  float  and  not  tied  to  any  currency,  and  limited \nexternal  borrowing.  The  recent  liquidity  crisis  has  not \naffected Viet Nam adversely. \nPossible  unsustainable  asset  price  bubble  in  the \nequity  market.  A  second  potential  risk  relates  to  rapid \ngrowth  in  Viet  Nam's  equity  markets,  and  the  likelihood \nthat  there  may  be  an  asset  bubble  that  may  not  be \nsustained.  The  securities  markets  regulator,  SSC,  is  quite \naware  of  this  risk  and  is  seeking  to  increase  investor \nawareness. At the same time, minor market corrections, if \nany,  would  actually  help \nIII \nimplementation  by  underlining  the  importance  of  high \ntransparency and investor protection in capital markets. \n\nto  strengthen  FSPL \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nv\n\nlegal  and \n\nPolitical  resistance  and  vested  interests  may  slow \nreforms. Implementation of the FSPL III program initiatives \nmay  get  delayed  due  to  resistance  from  vested  interests \nand  those  opposed  to  the  reforms.  However,  this  risk  is \nconsidered slight since the Government has so far shown \nimmense  resolve  and  commitment  to  pursuing  the  reform \nagenda.  Government  commitment  is  also  manifest  in  the \nscope  of \nregulatory  changes  already \nimplemented  in  the  financial  sector,  as  well  as  in  the \nproposed  reforms  in  both  the  bank  and  the  nonbank \nfinancial subsectors. \nProtectionist  backlash  against \nliberalization  and \nincreased foreign competition. The urgency of reforms is \nin some cases associated with commitments made by the \nGovernment  in  the  process  of  accession  to  the  World \nTrade  Organization;  for  example,  liberalization  of  foreign \nentry  into  banking  has  focused  energy  on  reforming  and \nstrengthening  state-owned  banks  and  partially  privatizing \ntheir  ownership.  If  domestic  firms  are  unable  to  withstand \nthe  competition,  including  in  nonfinancial  sectors  of  the \neconomy,  there  could  be  organized  opposition  to  such \nreforms, resulting in a slowdown or even reversal in some \ncases.  However,  the  economy  has  been  growing  fast \nthrough  the  decade,  export  growth  has  been  strong,  and \nthe  risk  of  perceived  vulnerability  to  foreign  competition \nappears low. \nPoor  governance  and  corruption.  These  may  erode \neffectiveness  and  implementation  of  the  reform  initiatives. \nHowever,  the  Government  is  increasingly  adopting  a \ntougher  stance  against  corruption  and  recently  undertook \nseveral  legal  reforms,  including  enactment  of  the  Anti-\nCorruption  Law,  and  setting  up  of  a  steering  committee \nagainst  corruption,  headed  directly  by  the  Prime  Minister. \nThe  Government  has  established  a  legal  framework  to \nprotect  and  reward  whistle-blowers  against  corruption. \nSpecific  program  components  will  contribute  to  reducing \ncorruption  by  enhancing  standards  of  disclosure  and \ntransparency,  focusing  on  strengthening  the  regulator  for \nimproving  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  securities \nmarkets,  and  increasing  coordination  and  information \nexchange among regulatory agencies. \nInsufficient \ncapacity  of  government \nagencies.  Limited  technical  capacities  of  SBV,  MOF  and \nSSC,  which  as  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will \nbe  managing  complex  institutional  change,  may  slow \nprogram \nthe  Government's \nrecord and ADB's experience in the country suggests that \nthese  constraints  are  substantially  ameliorated  given \nadequate support and technical assistance. To reduce this \nrisk, an ADB technical assistance will be proposed early in \n2008 to help implement FSPL III. \n\nimplementation.

The program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nViet Nam has continued its impressive economic performance this decade, with average \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  per  annum  exceeding  7%  during  2002\u20132006  and \nexpected to exceed 8% during 2007\u20132010 (Table 1). This is consistent with the Government's \nobjective of achieving middle-income status by 2010. The rapid growth has been accompanied \nby  a  stable  outlook  for  both  fiscal  and  external  balance,  and  a  remarkable  shift  towards  a \nmarket-oriented  economic  system,  through  wide-ranging  reforms  and  liberalization,  marked \nmost  recently  by  the  country's  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  January \n2007.  Poverty  in  Viet  Nam  has  declined  rapidly  in  the  past  decade,  from  37.4%  in  1998  to \n19.5% in 2004; other social indicators of development are also showing improvement, including \ninfant and maternal mortality, child malnutrition (under 5 years), and access to safe water.  \n \nIn 2006, the Government approved the new Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u2013\n3. \n2010 (SEDP), which not only targets middle-income status by 2010 but also envisages industrial \ncountry  status  by  2020  through  increasing  average  GDP  per  capita  (about  $622  in  2005)  to \n$1,050\u2013$1,100  by  2010.  While  reaffirming  the  socialist  orientation  of  the  economy  and \npromoting  a  prominent  role  for  the  state  in  investment-led  growth,  the  SEDP  also  strongly \nemphasizes the objectives of business development, private investment, continuing transition to \na market-based system, and increased integration with the global economy. Consistent with the \nSEDP, the country strategy and program1 2007\u20132010 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nViet  Nam  is  consistent  with  the  SEDP,  and  supports  business-led  pro-poor  growth  through \npromoting \nfinancial \ninfrastructure  development,  a  business-enabling  environment,  and \nintermediation. \n \n\n2004 \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n2005 \n8.1 \n37.6 \n52.2 \n47.7 \n35.6 \n8.2 \n31.6 \n22.4 \n15.6 \n(2.8) \n(3.6) \n\n Item \nReal GDP Growth (%) \nGross Investment (%GDP) \nPrivate Investment (% total investment) \nPublic Investment (% total investment) \nGross Savings (% GDP) \nInflation (annual average) \nCredit Growth (%) \nExports Growth (in dollar terms) (%) \nImports Growth (in dollar terms) (%) \nFiscal Balance (% GDP) \nCurrent Account Balance (%GDP) \n( ) = negative. \na Estimated. \nSources:  General  Statistical  Office;  State  Bank  of  Vietnam;  Ministry  of  Finance;  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank.  2007.

The ratio of exports to GDP increased from about 46% in 2000 \nto  66%  in  2006,  indicating  growing  openness  of  the  economy  even  before  Viet Nam  joined \nWTO.  The  structure  of  exports  is  becoming  more  diversified;  commodities  such  as  crude  oil, \nrice, marine products, and coffee remain important, but the share of manufactured products is \nrising.  Exports  of  clothing,  electronics,  and  wood  products  each  expanded  by  at  least  20%  in \n2006.  Viet  Nam  is  committed  to,  and  benefiting  from,  growing  integration  with  the  global \neconomy. \n \n5. \nUnlike several other economies in the region, Viet Nam's rapid growth is relatively more \nbalanced,  driven  by  both  external  and  domestic  demand.  Rising  consumption  and  investment \nwere  both  manifest  in  the  robust  growth  in  domestic  demand  in  FY2006.  Growth  in  private \nconsumption  was  supported  by  rising  incomes  and  inward  remittances  of  about  $4 billion. \nInvestment  remained  high  at  38.4%  of  GDP.  Private  investment,  which  now  comprises  more \nthan  half  of  all  investment,  was  encouraged  by  further  simplification  of  administrative \nprocedures  for  businesses  and  moves  toward  equality  of  treatment  between  state  enterprises \nand the private sector and between domestic and foreign enterprises. Domestic private sector \ngrowth has been accelerating and its share in GDP is increasing gradually. Additionally foreign \ndirect  investment  commitments  rose  to  $10.2 billion  in  2006,  the  highest  since  the  country \nopened to investment in 1986.  \n \n6. \nInflation continues to be a concern, exceeding 7% on average during 2006 for the third \nyear  in  a  row.  In  February  2007  inflation  declined  to  6.5%  but  then  rose  to  7.6%  in  June. \nInflationary pressures reflect several factors, including growth in aggregate demand, high world \ncommodity prices, and monetary expansion triggered by incomplete sterilization of the high and \nrising  capital  inflows  into  the  economy.  Administered  domestic  fuel  prices  were  raised  in  April \nand  in  August  2006  by  a  cumulative  18.5%,  and  then  reduced  twice  by  a  cumulative  12.5%. \nSubsidies have been largely eliminated for gasoline and kerosene, and the Government plans \nto  eliminate  fuel  subsidies  completely  next  year.  The  minimum  salary  of  civil  servants  was \nincreased  by  30%  in  October  2006,  a  component  of  civil  service  reforms,  resulting  in  second-\nround effects on private sector wages. Domestic credit grew by almost 42% in 2004 and more \nthan 30% in 2005. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) imposed prudential standards in 2005 to \ncurb rapid growth, requiring commercial banks to limit medium- and long-term lending to 40% of \ntheir  short-term  funds.  These  restrictions  combined  with  high  inflows  of  foreign  currency,  in \nterms of remittances and foreign direct investment, contributed to excess liquidity in the banking \nsubsector that SBV reduced by issuing SBV bills and increasing reserve requirements in 2007.  \n \n7. \nViet Nam's strategy for sustaining its high growth into the future relies on attaining high \ninvestment,  of  as  much  as  40%  of  GDP,  including  public  investment.  Viet  Nam's  aggregate \nsavings rate, about 36% of GDP in 2006, is lower than in some of the economies in the region \nbut rising.2 Savings are likely to continue increasing in view of the favorable demographic profile \nof  the  country,  which  has  one  of  the  youngest  populations  in  Asia  with  more  than  65%  of  the \npopulation below 65 years of age. The median age of the population is expected to be only 29 \nyears in 2015 (compared with 37 years in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)), and the ratio \nof  working  to  dependent  population  is  expected  to  continue  rising  in  the  medium  term,  with  a \nfavorable impact on aggregate savings ratios.  \n\n                                                 \n2   The savings to GDP ratio in 2006 was about 47% in the People's Republic of China and 40% in Malaysia. However \nViet  Nam's  savings  rate  was  comparable  to  India  (33%)  and  higher  than  Thailand  (30%),  Indonesia  (29%),  and \nPhilippines (21%).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n8. \nAlthough  domestic  savings  rates  are  likely  to  rise,  and  foreign  direct  investment  is \nincreasing,  the  ability  of  the  economy  to  sustain  high  growth  will  require  increased  financial \nintermediation  and  improved  efficiency  of  resource  allocation.  The  banking  system,  which  still \ndominates the financial sector, will need to be complemented by growth in the capital markets, \nparticularly  to  finance  needed  medium-  and  long-term  infrastructure  investments  by  both  the \npublic  and  private  sectors.  The  increased  role  of  nonbank  financial  intermediation  in  the \neconomy  will  be  essential  to  help  the  country  reach  its  investment  and  growth  objectives  in  a \nsustainable manner. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nThe  financial  sector  is  still  underdeveloped,  inefficient,  fragmented,  and  dominated  by \n9. \nthe  state.  Financial  deepening,  measured  by  the  ratio  of  broad  money,  or  M2,  to  GDP  has \npicked pace in the past decade, rising from about one quarter in 1997 to more than 80 percent \nin  2007.  Nonetheless  much  of  the  non-bank  financial  sector  exists  in  the  penumbra  of  the \nbanking system, which in turn is dominated by the public sector. The formal financial system is \nyet  to  go  beyond  the  early  stages  of  development  and  cash  is  even  now  the  most  commonly \nused  payment  instrument  across  the  economy,  with  US  dollars  widely  used  for  payments  of \ngoods and services. More detailed analysis of the financial sector is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nSector Description and Performance  \n\nA. \n\n10. \nBanking sector remains underdeveloped, though cautious and persistent reforms \ncontinue.  The banking sector has grown significantly since the adoption of the Law on Credit \nInstitutions in 1998. The law allowed a variety of products to be offered by credit institutions and \nintroduced  prudential  provisions \nincluding  capital  norms,  restrictions  on  asset/liability \nmanagement,  deposit  insurance  and  limits  on  investments  by  credit  institutions  in  real  estate. \nThe number of banks increased due to lowered entry barriers: there are currently 37 joint stock \nbanks,  5  joint  venture  banks  and  31  foreign  banks  in  addition  to  5  state-owned  commercial \nbanks (SOCBs) and two development and policy banks. Both loans and deposits of the banking \nsector  have  grown  rapidly  since  1998,  at  average  annual  growth  rates  exceeding  25  percent. \nThe  share  of  SOCBs  has  been  declining,  though  they  still  dominate  the  banking  sector, \naccounting for nearly 70 percent of all deposits, and 69 percent of total lending in 2005; by way \nof  comparison,  SOCB  share  in  total  lending  was  73  percent  in  2001.  The  share  of  SOCB \nlending  going  to  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  has  also  been  declining,  as  has  the \nimportance of policy-based lending in their operations. \n \n11. \nRestructuring of the banking subsector has sought to improve the legal, regulatory, and \nsupervisory  framework  of  banking,  and  to  address  problems  of  nonperforming  assets, \nparticularly of SOCBs, by enhancement of capital and enlarging the scope of SOCBs to operate \non  sound  market  principles.3 Banking  reforms  have  acquired  added  urgency  given  Viet  Nam's \ncommitment under WTO accession to liberalize foreign entry into its banking system from 2007. \nA banking system reform road map has been developed under which all SOCBs will gradually \nbe  equitized  and  international  prudential  standards  applied  by  2010.  In  preparation  for  the \nequitization  of  the  SOCBs,  the  standards  for  financial  disclosure  for  SOCBs  have  been \nimproved  closer  to  international  standards  and  the  equity  stake  allowed  to  foreign  strategic \n                                                 \n3   Banking  sector  reforms  are  also  supported  by  the  aid  community  through  the  World  Bank's  Poverty  Reduction \nSupport Credit (PRSC). ADB is cofinancing PRSC6; see ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Program  Loan  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  to  Support  the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program IV. Manila. (Approved October). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\ninvestors increased.4 The functioning of SBV will also be transformed under the new road map. \nThe  Government  is  working  on  a  new  law  to  be  adopted  in  2008,  which  will  enhance  the \noperating autonomy of SBV and strengthen its supervisory function. \n \n12.  Maturing  insurance  sector  needs  to  build  on  achievements.  The  commercial \ninsurance industry is relatively young, having been established in December 1994. It has grown \nrapidly in the past 5 years, with high double-digit annual growth in premiums between 2002 and \n2004, followed by slower growth of 8.8% in 2005 and 9.9% in 2006. Eight licensed life insurers \nand  15  licensed  nonlife  insurers  are  currently  operating.  In  2006,  the  insurance  industry  had \nwritten insurance premiums, net of reinsurance, amounting to D14.9 trillion ($930 million), split \nroughly in proportions of 60%:40% between life insurance and nonlife insurance premiums. The \ngrowth  in  insurance  premiums  represents  an  increase  of  92%  over  the  past  5  years,  yet \namounts to only 1.65% of GDP.  \n \n13. \nHigh growth of the industry primarily reflects the low base at the start. The industry is still \nunderdeveloped in terms of premium penetration (which is half that of the PRC and India,5 and \nfar  from  the  Government's  target  of  4.2%  of  GDP  by  2010)  and  product  range.  In  non-life \ninsurance, a level-playing field seems not to exist, with combined share of international insurers \nonly  about  5  percent.  International  insurers  face  restrictions  insuring  SOEs  or  Vietnamese \nnationals though, with accession to the WTO, many of these licensing restrictions will likely be \nlifted in 2008. The life insurance subsector is concentrated in a single product, the endowment \npolicy, which accounted for 87% of all new life insurance premiums in 2006. The limited product \nrange  also  reflects  inability  of  the  industry  to  offer  genuine  long-term  risk  cover  due  to \nunderdeveloped capital markets, which do not yet allow for insurance companies to match long-\nterm  liability  with  comparably  long-term  assets.  The  industry  is  now  exploring  sale  of \ninvestment-linked products, whose approval process along with relevant regulations is expected \nto be completed in the latter half of 2008.  \n \nLeasing  industry  is  constrained  by  financial  capacity,  limited  public  awareness \n14. \nand enforcement. The nascent leasing sector in the country is supervised by the SBV and has \n12 finance leasing companies, 3 of which are joint ventures and 5 are subsidiaries of SOCBs.6 \nThe activities of financial leasing companies are confined to (i) financial leasing for machinery, \nequipment,  vehicles,  and  other  movable  assets;  (ii)  advising  clients  on  matters  relating  to \nfinancial leasing operations; and (ii) other services related to financial leasing. Leased assets at \nthe end of 2006 are estimated at about $577 million. Leasing is still a new product in Viet Nam, \nand awareness of its special security features is limited. Growth of the leasing industry is also \nconstrained by lack of adequate financing. Finance leasing companies are permitted to mobilize \nfinancial resources from (i) short-, medium-, and long-term borrowing from credit institutions in \nViet Nam and abroad; (ii) issuance of bonds with a term of more than  1 year (subject to SBV \napproval); and (iii) other means as stipulated in Article 16 of Decree 16. Leasing companies that \nare subsidiaries of SOCBs, currently source all or most of their funds from their parent banks. \n\n                                                 \n4  Financial  consultants  for  the  valuation  process  for  two  of  the  SOCBs  have  already  been  hired,  with  initial  public \nofferings scheduled in 2007 and 2008, while the process for the others is ongoing. However, on 10 July 2007, the \nPrime Minister directed government officials to \"re-examine the equitization plan of state-run enterprises in 200.7. \nThe directive followed negative market sentiment in the wake of the initial public offering of Bao Viet Insurance, the \nstate-run insurance company, and may delay some large equitizations planned for 2007. \n\n5   All  three  countries,  Viet  Nam,  PRC,  and  India,  had  a  single  state-owned  insurance  entity  for  decades  before \nopening  their  doors  to  competition  (India  in  the  1980s,  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  in  the  early  1990s);  all  three \neconomies are among the most rapidly growing in the world with similar consumer profiles. \n\n6   The leasing industry in Viet Nam is governed by Decree 16 (May 2001) as amended by Decree 65 (June 2005), \n\nCircular No. 8/2001 (September 2001), and Circular No. 6/2005 (June 2005). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nUnless  supervised,  this  can  lead  to  excessive  lending  by  banks  through  these  leasing \nsubsidiaries to related parties, and the possibility of regulatory arbitrage on the part of banks. \n \n15. \nCapital  Markets:  Heterogeneous  Growth,  Uniformly  Underdeveloped.  Securities \ntrading  centers  (STCs)  were  established  in  2000  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HSTC),  and  in  2005  in \nHanoi  (HaSTC).  HaSTC  was  intended  to  serve  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  will \nbe the official over-the-counter market in the country; while HSTC will be the stock exchange. \nStarting  with  only  five  listed  companies,  HSTC  grew  modestly  to  26  listed  companies  by  late \n2004. Since then, with growing interest from international investors, both exchanges have grown \nrapidly, particularly in 2006; the index for HSTC (VNINDEX) rose from 307.5 in 2005 to 751.8 at \nthe  end  of  2006,  an  increase  of  144%;  the  index  for  HaSTC,  which  is  much  smaller,  rose  by \n152%  from  96.2  to  242.9  during  the  same  period.  Total  company  listings  at  the  two  trading \ncenters have increased four fold, from 44 to 193, between the end of 2005 and end 2006, while \ntotal market capitalization increased by almost 21 times (from D11 trillion to D231 trillion), or to \n25.0%  of  GDP  in  2006  compared  with  1.3%  at  the  end  of  2005.  The  extent  of  market \nexuberance  is  evident  from  noting  that  the  Government  had  initially  set  a  target  for  combined \nmarket capitalization of the two exchanges at 10 percent of GDP by 2010, which has been far \nexceeded  already.  The  country  now  has  55  securities  firms  and  18  fund  management \ncompanies. The regulated equity markets are, however, still among the smallest in the region7 \nand small compared with the unregulated market for trading equity in Viet Nam. The latter grew \nout  of  the  ambitious  equitization  program  of  SOEs,  only  a  few  of  which  listed  in  the  formal \nexchanges.  \n \n16. \nThe  underdevelopment  of  capital  markets  is  particularly  manifest  in  the  markets  for \ngovernment debt, and even more so in case of the corporate debt market. Outstanding bonds \nissued by the State Treasury, Vietnam Development Bank, and municipal governments totaled \nabout  D125  trillion  at  the  start  of  2007,  an  increase  of  almost  635%  over  the  corresponding \nvalue for 2002.8 Nonetheless, outstanding government debt represents only about 13% of GDP. \nThe  primary  market  for  government  securities  is  highly  segmented  due  to  multiple  issues  and \ndifferentiated channels of distribution. The State Treasury of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has \nmore  than  100  issues  per  year  of  dong-denominated  treasury  bills  of  6-,  9-,  and  12-month \nmaturity,  and  bonds  with  maturity  of  2,  3,  5,  10,  and  15  years.  These  are  issued  through  four \nchannels:  (i)  treasury-bill  auctions  through  SBV,  with  SBV  as  the  registrar;  (ii)  bond  auctions \nthrough the STCs with the State Securities Commission (SSC) as the registrar, (iii) underwriting \nthrough  syndicates  of  designated  banks  and  securities  firms  with  each  underwriter  as  the \nregistrar,  and  (iv)  direct  placement  or  retails  sales  of  bonds  to  the  public  through  the  national \nnetwork of 600 offices of the State Treasury with each office as the registrar. In addition, SBV \nissues its own short-term securities for purposes of liquidity management. Banks are the largest \ninvestors  in  the  primary  debt  market;  insurance  companies  have  a  significant  presence  in \nlonger-term bonds.  \n \n17. \nAlthough nearly three quarters of outstanding bonds are accounted for by 2\u2013 to 5-year \nnotes,  the  small  volume  with  a  large  number  of  issues  and  absence  of  benchmark  issues \nreduces the liquidity of any given issue. The primary debt market is characterized by more than \n400 issues listed on the STCs. Illiquidity of the issues is reflected in the secondary market that is \nyet  to  develop,  with  most  investors  buying  debt  and  holding  it  to  maturity.  The  market  for \n\n                                                 \n7   Market  capitalization  as  percent  to  GDP  in  March  2007  was  higher  in  all  other  countries  in  the  region,  \n\ne.g., Indonesia (37%), Thailand (65%), Philippines (124%), and Malaysia (180%). \n\n8   Compared with total outstanding debt of approximately $7.8 billion in Viet Nam, debt outstanding was $75 billion in \n\nPhilippines, $91 billion in Indonesia, $121 billion in Thailand, and $167 billion in Malaysia. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ncorporate debt is also quite rudimentary, with only four large companies having issued debt by \nthe end of 2006 with total outstanding corporate debt at D9.6 trillion or 8% of public debt (one \nfirm had issued debt in 2007 as of October).9 Issuances of debt by subnational entities are also \nextremely limited, with only three municipalities having issued debt to date, including Hanoi and \nHo Chi Minh City.  \n  \n18. \nInterbank  transactions  in  the  money  markets  are  also  still  in  the  rudimentary  stage  of \ndevelopment,  with  banks  more  likely  to  transact  with  SBV  than  with  one  another  and  the \ndomestic  interbank  deposit  rate  (VNIBOR)  carrying  bid/ask  spreads  as  high  as  0.20%\u20130.25%. \nThe  SOCBs  that  dominate  the  banking  system,  in  terms  of  deposits,  have  been  parking  their \nexcess liquidity at SBV through open market operations, at interest rates much lower (e.g., more \nthan 350 basis points in May 2007)  than those prevailing in the interbank transactions among \njoint  stock  and  other  banks.  The  interbank  repurchase  (repo)  market  is  constrained  by  lack  of \nsupporting  infrastructure  as  well  as  absence  of  standard  conventions  and  contracts.  Under \ncurrent regulations banks cannot be members of the Viet Nam Securities Depository (VSD), and \nhave to undertake payment and settlement of securities through securities firms, thus increasing \nthe cost and time of transactions, and the settlement risk. \n \n19.  Market  infrastructure  is  improving  but  needs  substantial  further  enhancement. \nBasic financial sector infrastructure, such as accounting and auditing, clearance and settlement, \nand  payment  systems,  has  been  improving,  but  the  process  needs  to  be  accelerated.  The \nAccounting  Law,  approved  in  2003  and  effective  since  January  2004,  provides  the  legal \nframework for accounting and auditing, along with three implementing decrees: Decree 128 on \npublic  sector  accounting,  Decree  129  on  corporate  accounting,  and  Decree  185  on \nadministrative  penalties  for  accounting  violations.  In  addition,  Decree  105  on  independent \nauditing  regulates  auditing  firms  and  independent  auditors,  including  professional  qualification \nand certification. As of October 2007, MOF has issued 26 accounting standards and 37 auditing \nstandards  in  line  with  international  accounting  standards  (IAS),  but  more  will  be  needed, \nincluding, for example, for different financial instruments. Self-regulating organizations, such as \nprofessional  associations  of  accountants,  have  a  limited  role  in  monitoring  and  maintaining \nstandards in accounting and auditing practices. \n \nAccounting and auditing have grown rapidly in the past 5 years: the number of auditing \n20. \nfirms grew from 9 to 140. Of these, about a dozen are licensed by MOF to provide services to \nlisted  companies  based  on  meeting  a  set  of  threshold  criteria,  including  minimum  capital \nrequirements, number of served clients, number of certified public accountants, and number of \nyears  in  operation.  While  the  number  of  auditors  has  grown,  rapid  economic  growth  has \ncontributed to demand for their services exceeding current capacity. The country currently has \nabout 900\u20131000 certified public accountants and this is expected to increase by about 50% in \nthe next 3 years. Requirements for certification currently include a relevant university degree, 4\u2013\n5 years of  work experience, and completion of the qualifying examination conducted by  MOF, \nalthough  the  required  industry  experience  is  being  beneficially  reduced.  Foreign  qualifications \nfrom  selected  countries  are  recognized  and  individuals  possessing  such  credentials  can \npractice provided they pass the examination. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   Corporate bond issuance is governed by Decree 52 of 2006 on Public Offering of Corporate Bonds, which requires \na  minimum  of 100  buyers;  and  that  the  issuer  have  a  minimum  charter  capital  of  D10  billion,  be  profitable  in  the \npreceding  year,  have  no  carry-over  loss  or  overdues  of  more  than  a  year,  and  offer  a  clear  plan  for  utilizing  the \nissuance proceeds.  \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\n \n\n7 \n\nThe Government\u2019s Action Plan for Securities Market Development 2006-2010, provides \n21. \nthe strategy for securities market development, as approved in the Prime Minister Decision No. \n163/2003/QD\u2013TTg  of  August  2003.  The  plan  calls  for  accelerating  and  coordinating  securities \nissuance  and  listing  through  promulgation  of  new  Enterprise  and  Securities  Laws,  continued \nequitization of SOEs, and tax incentives for companies listing before 2007. The plan also calls \nfor  development  of  bond  markets;  encouraging  general  corporations  and  large  firms  to  issue \ncorporate bonds; establishing credit-rating agencies; and transforming STCs from government-\nowned administrative organizations to privately owned, self-regulating organizations under SSC \nfund \nsupervision.  Expansion  of \nmanagement  companies,  enhancement  of  information  technology  infrastructure  of  securities \nmarkets, and greater international integration are also addressed. FSPL III, developed through \nwide-ranging  consultations, \nthe \nGovernment's plan for developing securities markets in Viet Nam. \n \nIssues and Opportunities \n\nis  consistent  with  and  builds  upon \n\nthrough  development  of \n\nthe  approach  of \n\ninvestor  base, \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\nA  primary  constraint  to  the  development  of  the  financial  sector  is  the  absence  of  well-\n22. \ndeveloped  capital  markets.  Development  of  capital  markets  will  lead  to  improved  allocation  of \nresources,  enable  a  wider  variety  of  projects  to  be  financed,  provide  government  and  private \nsector access to longer-term funds at lower costs, and improve banking efficiency. More liquid \nmarkets  for  government  debt  in  particular  will  facilitate  pricing  of  other  riskier  financial  assets \nwith a direct impact on the degree to which other segments of financial markets can develop risk \nallocation functions. The depth of money and bond markets is an important determinant of the \ntransmission mechanism of monetary policy and of central bank effectiveness. Development of \nthe  financial  sector  in  Viet  Nam  therefore  needs  growth  of  deep  and  liquid  capital  markets,  in \nterms  of  reduced  costs  of  transacting  in  these  markets,  greater  breadth  of  the  markets,  and \nenhanced participation of investors.  \n \n\n1. \n\nHigh Transaction Costs \n\n23. \nTransaction  costs  in  Viet  Nam's  capital  markets  are  high:  the  bid-ask  spread,  for \nexample, for 10-year government bonds was 22.5 basis points in 2006, compared with 2 basis \npoints  in  Malaysia,  3  in  Thailand,  and  17  in  Indonesia.10 Reduction  in  costs  of  transacting,  in \nterms of costs of arranging, executing, and settling a transaction, is an important objective. To \nthe  extent  capital  markets  trade  financial  claims  on  future  cash  flows,  transaction  costs  are \nstrongly  affected  by  the  quality  and  scope  of  information  available  to  market  participants,  and \nthe efficiency of the market infrastructure to ensure prompt and reliable settlement of the trades. \n \n\na. \n\nMarket Information \n\n \nGreater information availability in the public domain at the levels of markets, participants, \n24. \nand  products  is  necessary  for  lowering  information  barriers  that  raise  the  costs  of transacting. \nThis includes market indices; volumes traded for listed securities; daily high and low prices; as \nwell  as  information  on  securities  intermediaries  and  on  listed  companies,  such  as  company \nownership and changes therein (by significant shareholders and company insiders), and audited \nfinancial  statements.  Over  all,  levels  of  transparency  and  disclosure  in  Viet  Nam's  capital \nmarkets  need  to  converge  to  international  standards.  The  need  for  greater  price  transparency \n\n                                                 \n10  AsianBondsonline. 2006. Local Currency Bond Market Liquidity Survey.  Available: \n\nhttp://asianbondsonline.adb.org/documents/abm_nov2006.pdf \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nranks  among  the  top  three  constraints  in  debt  markets  according  to  a  2006  survey  of  market \nmakers in Viet Nam (footnote 10).11 \n \n\n8\n \n\nb. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Public Disclosure \n\n \n25. \nThe quality of information made available is also important. The increased presence and \nrole  of  foreign  companies  and  investors  that  has  accompanied  Viet  Nam's  economic  reforms \nhave  increased  the  demand  for  improved  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Customers, \nlenders,  bankers,  and  investors  increasingly  seek  information  that  is  truly  transparent.  The \nGovernment  too  has  recognized  the  importance  of  accounting  regulations  and  disclosure  of \nfinancial statements to steadily, albeit cautiously, adopt international standards.  \n \nAs a result, both auditing and public disclosure requirements and standards have risen \n26. \nsubstantially  in  the  recent  past.  All  public  companies  are  now  required  to  publicly  disclose \nannually audited financial statements, and the Government issued regulations on uniform format \nfor financial reporting by public companies. A new general accounting system was adopted on \n20  March  2006,  with  MOF  Decision  15/2006/QD-BTC.  Standards  of  accounting  and  auditing \nhowever  need  to  improve  substantially  to  catch  up  with  the  growing  complexity  of  an \nincreasingly  market-based,  rapidly  growing  economy.  Financial  status  and  performance  of \nbanks  and  other  financial  companies  still  lack  adequate  transparency  due  to  use  of  historical \ncost-based  accounting  for  investments,  classification  of  loans,  and  fixed-asset  depreciation. \nRegulations  for  mark-to-market  accounting  consistent  with  international  accounting  standards \n(IAS 32) need to be phased in. Accounting guidelines for several areas of the financial sector, \nsuch  as  stock  exchanges,  securities  firms,  and  repo  transactions,  have  yet  to  be  developed. \nIncreasing the standards of accounting and audit requires that the quality of small- and medium-\nsized  auditing  firms  is  improved,  including  by  upgrading  the  quality  of  examination  used  for \ncertifying public accountants, and by increasing the monitoring role and responsibilities of self-\nregulating  professional  bodies,  such  as  the  Vietnamese  Association  of  Chartered  Public \nAccountants. \n \n\nc. \n\nTrading, Clearing, and Settlement Technology \n\n \nUntil 2006, the two STCs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi provided independent trading \n27. \nfloors  as  well  as  separate  clearing  and  settlement  systems.  Since  then  the  institutional  and \ntechnological  architecture  of  trading,  clearing,  and  settlement  has  been  improving  with \nintroduction  of  a  central  registry\u2014VSD\u2014along  with  ownership  evidenced  by  book  entry  and \nconsolidation  under  VSD  of  depository,  clearing,  and  settlement  functions.  However,  VSD \ninherited  two  separate  and  different  systems  that  are  yet  to  be  integrated  within  a  technically \nunified  framework  that  can  interface  directly  with  both  the  STCs  and  the  auction  house  (for \ntreasury  bills)  at  SBV.  Payment  settlement  currently  is  often  on  a  T+2  or  a  T+3  basis12,  and \nneeds to be made more efficient. Both the STCs and VSD were established as part of SSC, the \nmarket  regulator,  which  itself  is  part  of  MOF.  Their  governance  needs  to  be  improved  by \ntransforming  the  STCs  and  VSD  into  legally  separate  entities,  with  a  view  eventually  to  allow \ntransfer of ownership to the private sector. \n \n\n                                                 \n11  The other two factors were identified as improving repurchase agreements (repo transactions), and increasing the \n\ndiversity of investors, which are both covered in the two following sections.  \n\n12 The  period  of  time  between  the  settlement  date  and  the  transaction  date  that  is  allotted  to  the  parties  of  a \n\ntransaction to satisfy the transaction's obligations; measured as transaction date plus number of days. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n2. \n\nIneffective Issuance Framework \n\n28. \nFurther development of deep and liquid debt markets in Viet Nam will require substantial \nimprovements  in  the  framework  for  debt  issuance.  The  primary  market  for  government \nsecurities is highly segmented due to multiple issues and channels of distribution, and there are \ntoo  many  issues  relative  to  the  total  volume  of  debt,  resulting  in  more  than  400  outstanding \nissues listed. Benchmark issues of sufficient volume need to be developed to enhance liquidity. \nThis  will  require  amendments  to  existing  government  regulations  that  constrain  buyback  of \ngovernment securities as well as reopening of issues, in order to start issuing benchmark issues \nand  consolidate  and  restructure  the  large  number  of  outstanding  debt  issues  into  fewer  and \nmore liquid securities. \n \nThe  excessive  number  of  issuances  is  accompanied  by  lack  of  adequate  predictability \n29. \nabout  the  schedule  of  debt  issues,  constraining  planning  by  market  participants.  Although  the \ntotal amount of new debt planned is evident at the start of the fiscal year from the Government's \nannual  budget,  planning  by  market  participants  is  constrained  due  to  the  limited  information \nabout planned issuances during the year. MOF provides an issuance calendar with a horizon of \nonly one quarter; however its credibility is affected by the Government not always sticking to the \nannounced  calendar  if  market  conditions  appear  adverse.  Predictability  of  issuances  needs  to \nbe improved both in terms of reliability of the schedule and its time horizon.  \n \n30. \nDevelopment of the primary debt market is further compounded by government efforts to \nsimultaneously  control  the  quantity  and  price  of  debt  issued  by  imposing  interest  ceilings  on \neach issuance. In part this reflects government concerns about possible collusion among limited \nbidders  in  the  market,  but  the  price  controls  are  blatantly  harmful  to  market  development  and \nneed to be removed as early as possible. Elimination of price controls and thence artificially low \nborrowing  costs  for  government  will  be  a  potent  signal  of  government  commitment  to  further \ndevelopment of bond markets.  \n \n31. \nThe  underdeveloped  primary  debt  market  and  the  stunted  secondary  markets  ensure \nthat no meaningful benchmark yield curve is available to help price other, riskier assets in the \neconomy.  Developing  this  benchmark  yield  curve  will  require  time,  but  needs  to  start  by \nensuring  a  healthy  market  at  the  short  end  of  the  yield  curve.  A  focus  on  developing  the \ninterbank  money  and  repo  markets  is  therefore  necessary.  Transactions  among  banks  are \nconstrained by lack of adequate trust among participants, and segmentation between the public \nsector  banks  (SOCBs)  and  remaining  banks.  Segmentation  and  heterogeneity  in  the  money \nmarkets  is  also  manifest  in  the  use  of  different  contracts  among  participants  for  repo \ntransactions. Adoption of a standardized repo contract is important to further development of the \ninterbank  repo  market.  There  is  also  need  to  allow  banks  to  become  full  members  of  VSD  so \nthey can reduce transactions costs and settlement risks by settling transactions directly.  \n \n32. \nOne of the constraints to development of secondary markets for government debt is the \nabsence  of  a  system  of  primary  dealers  who  will  be  market  makers  to  enhance  secondary \nmarket liquidity. The Government needs to study and evaluate the preferred design of a primary \ndealer  system,  and  prepare  a  plan  for  introducing  it.  Development  of  an  active  market  for \ncorporate  bonds  will  be  facilitated  by  active  primary  and  secondary  markets  for  government \ndebt,  but  will  need  SSC  to  streamline  its  approval  process  for  public  offerings.  In  addition, \nimproved  disclosure  standards  will  need  to  be  accompanied  over  time  with  development  of \nindependent  credit-rating  and  bond-pricing  agencies,  which  currently  do  not  exist  due  to  the \nextremely limited market size. An improved framework for corporate debt issuance will lead to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ngreater  participation  of  other  issuers  in  capital  markets,  including,  for  example,  leasing \ncompanies.  \n \n\n1\n0\n \n\n3. \n\nWeak Investor and Consumer Protection Framework \n\ninspection, \n\nfor  high-quality \n\n33. \nA  key  to  development  of  capital  markets  in  Viet  Nam  is  enhancing  the  size  and \nheterogeneity  of  the  investors'  pool;  this  is  currently  constrained  by  a  weak  framework  for \ninvestor  and  consumer  protection.  Despite  rapid  recent  growth,  the  formal  or  regulated  stock \nexchanges  are  still  substantially  smaller  than  the  unregulated  market  and  strong  investor \nprotection in the regulated markets will help redress the balance. Growing interest from foreign \ninvestors  will  also  entail  improving  the  framework  for  investor  protection.  This  will  require \nregulatory  and  institutional  changes  towards  adoption  of  high  levels  of  transparency  and \ninformation  disclosure,  as  well  as  a  framework  for  investor  protection  consistent  with \ninternational  norms  (standards  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions \n[IOSCO]). \n \nImproving  the  investor  protection  framework  will  also  require  an  effective  market \n34. \nregulator  with  capabilities \ninvestigation,  surveillance,  and \nenforcement;  as  well  as  development  of  an  effective  compliance  program.  The  capabilities  of \nSSC for undertaking market surveillance and monitoring need to be strengthened, including by \nexpanding  and  clarifying  the  role  of  self-regulatory  organizations  (SROs)  in  surveillance  and \nmonitoring, and developing operating procedures specifying respective roles and responsibilities \nof the SROs and the market regulator. \n \nThe  regulator  also  needs  to  integrate  greater  use  of  information  technology  in  its \n35. \nfunctions, and develop a web-based system to facilitate lodgment, monitoring, and resolution of \ninvestor complaints. To enhance transparency and credibility of the market, the regulator should \nalso  make  public  through  its  website  cases  of  regulatory  noncompliance,  along  with  the \nidentities of the parties concerned and the penalties imposed. While ignorance of law is not an \nexcuse,  the  Government  needs  to  expand  over  time  awareness  on  part  of  all  market \nparticipants of the improved regulatory framework, rights of concerned entities, and penalties for \nnoncompliance.  \n \n36. \nThe  framework  for  consumer  protection  also  needs  to  be  enhanced  in  the  rapidly \nexpanding insurance subsector that will increasingly grow in the complexity of products offered \nand  of  the  resulting  regulatory  requirements  to  ensure  sound  financial  status  of  insurance \ncompanies.  As  insurance  companies  seek  expansion  into  new  products,  such  as  investment-\nlinked  insurance  plans,  new  regulations  will  need  to  be  developed.  Risk-based  regulatory \noversight  will  need  to  be  introduced;  accounting  standards  and  information  exchange  of \ncompanies  with  regulators  will  have  to  be  strengthened.  Current  laws  discriminating  against \ntreatment  of  group  life  insurance  premiums  as  business  deductibles  constrain  growth  of  the \ninsurance subsector and will need to be revised.  \n \n37. \nADB  has  consistently  supported,  through  both  the  Second  Financial  Sector  Program \n(FSPL  II) 13 and  its  predecessor  (FSPL  I), 14 consumer  protection  through  strengthening  anti-\nmoney-laundering  and  consumer  deposit  insurance.  Notwithstanding  progress  in  both  areas, \nthere  is  a  need  to  further  consolidate  on  the  gains.

Manila. \n\n14  ADB.  1996.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Financial Sector Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nCenter (AMLIC) was established under FSPL II, but needs to be strengthened with more use of \ninformation technology, resources, and staff. Guidelines will need to be developed and issued to \nfinancial  institutions  on  transaction  reporting  and  know-your-customer  requirements,  and  on \ndevelopment  of  internal  anti-money-laundering  procedures.  The  significance  of  the  Deposit \nInsurance  of  Viet  Nam  (DIV)  will  increase  with  greater  divestment  of  SOCBs  and  financial \nliberalization in the banking subsector. The Government is developing a new law on bankruptcy \nof credit institutions and the respective roles of SBV and DIV in the resolution process of such \ninstitutions need to be clarified.  \n \n38. \nGrowing liberalization and sophistication of the financial sector in Viet Nam is increasing \nthe  urgency  to  shift  away  from  current  institution-based  supervision  towards  functional \nsupervision, as larger financial institutions expand their activities into new areas of operation. In \naddition,  the  need  to  improve  and  increase  regulatory  coordination  among  various  financial \nsector  regulatory  agencies  is  also  growing.  The  Government  needs  to  develop  a  longer-term \nperspective on structure of financial sector regulatory supervision and assess the relevance of \ndifferent  models  of  supervision  and  regulation,  from  a  unified  financial  sector  regulator,  to \nmultiple but coordinating regulators.  \n \n\n4. \n\nInadequate Cooperation with Foreign Securities Regulators \n\nAccording to the Government\u2019s action plan for securities market development, Viet Nam \n39. \nseeks to integrate with the global financial markets, and has undertaken several commitments \nto  liberalize  the  financial  sector  in  the  process  of  its  accession  to  the  WTO.  Its  regulatory \nhorizon needs to be widened to encompass greater coordination with regional and international \nsecurities  regulators  and  markets,  including  harmonizing  criteria  for  securities  issuing,  listing, \ninformation  disclosure,  and  cross-listing  between  ASEAN  (Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations)  stock  exchanges.  With  greater  liberalization  and  integration  of  stock  markets,  firms \nfrom one country may list to raise capital in securities markets in another. Currently the market \nregulator  has  limited  capacity  to  monitor  foreign  investments  in  the  equity  markets,  and  with \neasing of outward capital flows over time, the ability to monitor outward investments will also be \nimportant.  Further  cooperation  with  securities  regulators  in  the  region  in  terms  of  information \nexchange, cooperation in inspections, surveillance over cross-border activities, and cooperation \nin  training  and  capacity  building  should  be  developed.  Viet  Nam  also  needs  to  develop  a \nstrategy to upgrade its financial system regulatory framework to benchmarks under the IOSCO \nMultilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMOU), and become a signatory to the MMOU. 15 \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n40. \nADB has actively supported financial sector reforms in Viet Nam over a decade through \ntwo program loans in 1996 and 2002: FSPL I  and FSPL II. During this period, the nature of Viet \nNam\u2019s  financial  sector  has  transformed  radically  from  the  earlier  system  predicated  on \ngovernment allocation of funds via a single state-owned bank (SBV) to a market-based system \nwhere SOCBs were established and are currently in the process of privatization, foreign banks \nhave  entered  and  are  operating,  and  the  Government  is  increasingly  focusing  its  attention  on \ncapital  market  development.  The  continuous  support  has  enabled  ADB  to  maintain  ongoing \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government,  regulatory  agencies,  industry  associations,  and  market \n                                                 \n15 IOSCO  adopted  the  IOSCO  Multilateral  Memorandum  Concerning  Consultation  and  Cooperation  and  the \nExchange of Information (MMOU) in May 2002. Currently 34 IOSCO members have signed the MMOU. Regulators \nwho  are  able  to  share  public  and  nonpublic  information  are  eligible  to  sign  Appendix  A  of  the  MMOU,  while \nregulators  that  face  impediments  to  information  sharing  are  eligible  to  sign  Appendix  B.  For  Appendix  B \nsignatories, IOSCO will monitor progress in addressing these impediments. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f1\n2\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nplayers. Reforms under  FSPL III, subprogram 1 have likewise been supported by  close policy \ndialogue  as  well  as  TA  support.    ADB  has  also  consulted  with  other  development  partners \nsupporting reforms in the financial sector in Viet Nam. The development coordination matrix is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n41. \nThe  first  program,  FSPL  I,  sought  principally  to  lay  the  legal  and  regulatory \nunderpinnings  for  commercial  banking  while  promoting  the  development  of  more  diverse \ninstitutions,  instruments,  and  markets.  FSPL  II  sought  to  strengthen  alternative  channels  for \nmarket-based  financial  intermediation  by  (i)  establishing  and  strengthening  a  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  framework  for  the  insurance  industry;  (ii)  developing  a  legal  framework  for  the \nleasing  industry;  (iii)  promoting  interbank  and  money  market  development  by  deregulating \ninterest  rates  and  increasing  the  number  of  instruments;  (iv)  fostering  capital  market \ndevelopment  by  increasing  the  number  of  quality  shares  in  the  market,  strengthening  market \nsurveillance,  and  increasing  participation  by  institutional  investors;  and  (v)  improving  financial \ninfrastructure such as audit and accounting systems and secured transactions systems. \n \nA key lesson emerging from these programs and reinforced in the program performance \n42. \naudit report16 for FSPL I and subsequent reports17 on FSPL II is that financial sector reforms are \ncomplex, involving major changes to the legal and institutional infrastructure, and thus need to \nallow for adequate time and flexibility in design. Designs of earlier programs recognized the far-\nreaching  and  medium-  to  long-term  nature  of  these  reforms  to  various  extents;  this  has  been \nreflected  in  continuity  of  support  in  key  areas  over  several  programs.  In  addition,  program \ndesign  should  incorporate  deep  consultative  processes  and  focus  on  reforms  where \ngovernment  commitment  is  strong.  Given  that  sometimes  the  reform  process  is  long, \nestablishing  and  maintaining  the  reform  process  may  in  some  cases  be  as  important  as \nimmediate program outcomes. The current program has also adopted a cluster approach (like \nthe  predecessor  FSPL  II),  over  a  projected  time  frame  of  about  5  years  in  recognition  of  the \nneed for flexibility as well as continuity of support over the medium term.  \n \n43. \nEffective technical and capacity building support for implementation of reforms as well as \nproject  management  can  also  be  identified  from  earlier  programs  as  important  to  achieving \nsuccessful  outcomes.  A  separate  TA  is  being  processed  for  approval  in  early  2008  that  will \ncontinue building on ADB's ongoing support for the financial sector, through policy development \nand improved regulation in key reform areas, including those identified in the FSPL III program, \nas well as provide for building capacity for project implementation in the Implementing Agencies \nfor  the  loan.  The  proposed  TA  will  focus  on  improving  market  liquidity  in  key  areas,  widening \nproduct  and  participant  range  in  the  markets,  and  enhanced  transparency  with  diminished \nregulatory  interventions,  as  also  strengthening  of  regulation  and  supervision.  The  FSPL  III \nprogram  and  the  TA  will  thus  together  provide  continuity  to  ADB  support  to  Viet  Nam  in  its \nefforts to develop a modern financial. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2003.

The last tranche of subprogram II of FSPL II \nis scheduled for release in the last quarter of 2007 and a project completion report for FSPL II is scheduled in the \nfirst quarter of 2008. FSPL II was characterized by timely completion of policy actions and initial assessments of its \nimplementation are positive. \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n\n13 \n\nFSPL  III  has  the  objective  of  creating  a  more  diversified,  deeper,  and  more  resilient \n44. \nfinancial sector in Viet Nam. The financial sector is currently dominated by the banking system, \nwhich is structurally limited in transforming short-term liabilities (deposits) into loans to finance \nlonger-term investments needed by the economy. By increasing the share of nonbank financial \nmarkets in financing investment, FSPL III will contribute to enabling sustained high growth in the \neconomy with reduced risks. The national development strategy (SEDP) seeks to sustain high \neconomic  growth  through  increased  investment,  which  will  require  a  growing  role  for  capital \nmarkets in providing medium- and long-term funding in a sustainable manner. Development of \ndiversified  capital  markets  will  contribute  to  sustained  growth  through  increased  efficiency  of \nfinancial  intermediation  in  the  economy,  more  efficient  allocation  of  resources,  and  sound \nmacroeconomic environment that is more resilient to external and regional shocks. FSPL III is \nconsistent with and supports the Government's Action Plan for Securities Market Development \n2006\u20132010, which implements the SEDP 2006\u20132010 and the commitments of the Government \nunder  bilateral  and  multilateral  (WTO)  agreements.  It  is  also  aligned  with  the  country  strategy \nand program 2007\u20132010, which highlights the need for supporting financial sector development \nto promote Viet Nam's economic growth. \n \n45. \nCapital markets trade financial claims across different points in time and states of nature \nand are therefore extremely information intensive. FSPL III encompasses components aimed at \npromoting the creation and dissemination of information required to enhance price discovery, as \nwell  as  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  information  available,  to  enable  better  informed  market \ndecisions. The ability of the markets to transact financial claims at low cost is also affected by \nthe  market  infrastructure  for  prompt  and  final  settlement  of  trades.  The  institutional  framework \nfor  securities  issuance  will  require  coordinated  efforts  between  key  government  agencies  and \nmarket participants to enhance the supply of assets in the capital markets. Enhancing the legal \nand regulatory framework to improve supervision of market conduct, promote transparency, and \nstrengthen  investor  protection  will  be  key  to  developing  and  expanding  safe  capital  markets. \nThe  scope  of  FSPL  III  also  includes  strengthening  the  capacity  and  functioning  of  regulators. \nGiven  growing  integration  of  global  financial  markets,  and  Viet  Nam's  commitments  towards \nfinancial liberalization, greater cross-border regulatory cooperation will promote development of \ncapital markets over the longer term. \n \nDevelopment  of  capital  markets  is  a  complex  process,  including  within  its  ambit  legal, \n46. \nregulatory, and institutional reforms, and may thus take time and entail flexibility in adapting to \nchanging  circumstances  in  the  reform  process.  FSPL  III  therefore  proposes  use  of  the  cluster \nmodality. The program cluster would consist of two subprograms anchored on the Government's \nreform agenda. The program cluster period will be from January 2006 to September 2010. As \nshown in FSPL III policy matrix (Appendix 4), the actions are undertaken in two phases under \nsubprogram  1,  namely,  Jan  2006\u2013September  2007  for  the  first  tranche  and  October  2007\u2013\nFebruary 2009 for the second tranche.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOverview of FSPLIII and Evolution of Capital Markets In Viet Nam \n\n1\n1\n4\n4\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n47. \nThe organizing conceptual framework of FSPL III and its policy actions is development \nof  deep  and  liquid  capital  markets  in  Viet  Nam.  Capital  market  liquidity  has  many  dimensions \nand varying definitions, but three elements are central to it: ability to transact quickly at low cost, \nacross a wide range of assets, with little impact on market prices.18 The importance of greater \nregional  cooperation  in  the  financial  sector  as  articulated  in  ADB's  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration Strategy seamlessly supplements this framework in the context of rapidly integrating \nglobal  financial  markets.19 The  financial  sector  development  and  reform  agenda  of  FSPL  III  is \nthus structured around the following four components:  \n \n\n \nenhanced market liquidity by lowering of transaction costs, \ninstitutional framework for securities issuance, \ninvestor and consumer protection, and \nimproved regional cooperation in securities market regulation. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnhanced Market Liquidity by Lowering of Transaction Costs \n\n48. \nDevelopment  of  information-intensive  capital  markets  is  critically  dependent  on  the \nscope  and  quality  of  information  available  to  the  market  participants.  FSPL  III  encompasses \ncomponents  aimed  at  promoting  the  creation  and  dissemination  of  information  required  to \nenhance price discovery, and promotes the ability of the markets to transact financial claims at \nlow  cost  by  increasing  the  efficiency  of  market  infrastructure  to  ensure  prompt  and  reliable \nsettlement of trades. FSPL III supports enhanced market liquidity by lowering transactions costs \nthrough  (i)  greater  market  disclosure  and  dissemination  of  information,  (ii)  improved  market \ninformation standards, and (iii) better market infrastructure for secondary trading of securities.  \n \n\na. \n\nMarket Disclosure and Dissemination of Information \n\n49. \nSecurities Law. The Government has initiated several important initiatives in moving to \na disclosure-based regime for securities markets by adopting a comprehensive new Securities \nLaw in June 2006, which became effective on 1 January 2007, and is a key component of FSPL \nIII. The law expands the jurisdiction of SSC, the market regulator, to include unlisted securities; \nclarifies public offering procedures; codifies the disclosure approach to regulation; and includes \na  framework  for  a  centralized  securities  depository,  investment  funds,  and  self-regulatory \norganizations (SROs). Prior to the new Securities Law, the regulatory framework was based on \ndecrees that defined securities markets quite narrowly in terms of institutions, products offered, \nand  activities  specifically  in  the  securities  trading  centers  (STCs). 20  As  noted  earlier,  the \nregulated stock exchanges in Viet Nam are still much smaller than the unregulated markets that \n\n                                                 \n18  The definition of market liquidity adopted by the study group on market liquidity established by the Committee on \nthe Global Financial System in December 1997 says \"A liquid market is a market where a large volume of trades \ncan  be  immediately  executed  with  minimum  effect  on  prices.\u201d  Market  liquidity  is  also  described  as  including \n\u201ctightness  (the  cost  of  turning  around  a  position  over  a  short  period  of  time),  depth  (the  size  of  an  order  flow \ninnovation required to change prices a given amount) and resiliency (the speed  with  which prices recover from a \nrandom, uninformative shock;\" Kyle, A. 1985.

Manila. \n20 The decrees were Decree 90 of 2003 (Decree 90/2003/ND-CP of August 12, 2003 on functions, tasks, rights, and \norganizational  structure  of  state  securities  companies),  Decree  144  of  2003  (Decree  No.  144/2003/ND-CP  of \nNovember 28, 2003 on securities and securities markets) and Decree No. 66 of 2004 (Decree No. 66/2004/ND-CP \nof February 19 2004) that merged the SSC into the Ministry of Finance. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ngrew with the equitization of SOEs, both before STCs were established in 2000, and also after \nwith  equitized  SOEs  that  did  not  list  on  the  STCs.  To  encourage  migration  of  companies  and \ntheir shares into the regulated exchanges, the jurisdiction of the new Securities Law has been \nextended to regulate all public companies21 irrespective of whether or not they are listed.  \n \n50. \nDisclosure  Requirements.  The  law  sets  forth  prospectus  disclosure  requirements, \nincluding  financial  statement  requirements;  and  clarifies  liability  for  prospectuses,  the  duty  to \nupdate  prospectus  disclosure,  and  periodic  reporting  requirements.  In  addition  to  disclosure \nobligations,  public  companies  are  required  to  comply  with  principles  of  good  corporate \ngovernance  under  the  law  and  centrally  register  and  deposit  their  securities  in  the  centralized \nsecurities  depository  (VSD).  Holders  of  5%  or  more  of  the  voting  shares  of  a  public  company \nare required to report such ownership to SSC and the exchange on which they are listed, and \nany changes in such ownership exceeding 1% of the total amount of the same class of shares \nin circulation.  \n \n51. \nThe disclosure requirements under the new law were further clarified by MOF through a \ncircular noting that information disclosure be made in a complete, accurate and timely manner in \naccordance  with  the  law  by  the  General  Directors,  who  are  responsible  for  confirming  or \ncorrecting any information disclosure made by any other person of the Company that may affect \nthe  company\u2019s  securities  price  within  24  hours  of  such  disclosure. 22 Listed  companies  are \nrequired  to  set  up  their  own  websites  and  update  information  disclosure  on  a  regular  basis  in \ncompliance with  the circular,  and  to  report  such  information  to  SSC.  The  circular  also  clarifies \nfinancial  statement  reporting  requirements,  including  timing  of  submission,  and  reporting  of \nshare  transactions  of  inside  shareholders  of  listed  issuers  (management,  board,  general \ndirector, deputy general director, and chief accountant). \n \n52. \nThe circular also clarified disclosure requirements of STCs (and stock exchanges). They \nare  required  to  disclose,  among  others,  information  on  securities  transactions  (number  of \nsecurities traded, prices, indices, price fluctuations, orders, and volume). Currently many over-\nthe-counter  transactions  do  not  get  reported  to  the  STCs.  To  widen  the  reach  of  the  new \ndisclosure-based  regime  in  the  financial  sector,  SSC  will  require  traders  in  2008  to  promptly \nreport  over-the-counter  transactions  in  securities  registered  with  VSD  to  the  STCs,  including \nprice, volume, and bid/offer spreads. \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Market Information Standards \n\nAccounting  Standards.  Viet Nam\u2019s accounting standards are based on a gradual and \n53. \ncautious adoption of international standards with adjustments for local conditions and capacity \nfor  effective  implementation.  MOF  has  issued  26  accounting  and  37  auditing  internationally \nbased  standards.  FSPL  III  will  support  further  enhancement  of  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards  in  Viet  Nam,  including  phasing  in  regulations  for  mark-to-market  accounting \nconsistent with IAS 32 (financial instruments: disclosures and presentation) and, subsequently, \nIAS  39  (financial  instruments:  recognition  and  measurement)  under  the  Viet  Nam  accounting \nsystem.  Since  implementation  of  the  mark-to-market  accounting  standards  relies  on  existence \n\n                                                 \n21  A public company is defined as a joint stock company that has a paid up charter capital of D10 billion or more and \nhas offered shares to the public, i.e., is listed or/and has at least 100 investors (excluding professional securities \ninvestors  defined  as  commercial  banks,  insurance  and  financial  leasing  companies,  and  securities  trading \ninstitutions). \n\n22  The  circular  includes  forms  for  disclosing  information  and  provides  that  information  disclosure  may  be  made  via \nmass media, including websites of the organization making the disclosure, and may be submitted electronically to \nSSC or the STCs in accordance with SSC and STC rules. \n\n \n\n\fof reasonably developed and active markets, MOF will phase in the new accounting standards \n(IAS  32)  in  a  step-by-step  manner  consistent  with  market  development  for  the  asset(s) \nconcerned. MOF will also develop and issue accounting guidelines that currently do not exist for \nthe  operation  of  stock  exchanges  and  securities  firms,  and  for  repurchase  agreements  (repo \ntransactions).  \n \n54. \nAccounting and Auditing Services. With the growing complexity of the accounting and \nauditing  standards,  small-  and  medium-sized  firms  are  having  increasing  difficulty  effectively \nresponding to their customers\u2019 accounting and auditing needs, especially in areas that involve \ninternational  best  practice  issues.  The  standards  of  these  accounting  and  audit  firms  are  still \nlow,  and  need  to  be  enhanced  through  issuance  of  guiding  procedures  and  training.  MOF  is \ncurrently developing, with ADB assistance, a basic audit program for small- and medium-sized \naudits  and  training  materials  for  Vietnamese  Associations  of  Chartered  Public  Accountants  to \nuse  in  training  courses  for  auditors.  The  standards  of  accounting  and  audit  services  in  the \neconomy is monitored by MOF, which has not only issued regulation for controlling the quality, \nbut also issued regulation (revising Decision 59) to upgrade the quality of examination used for \ncertifying  public  accountants,  revising  it  to  be  more  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the \nchanging economy. While the regulating and monitoring of professional standards and quality is \nstill  directly under  MOF,  the  role  of SROs,  such  as  the  Vietnamese  Associations  of  Chartered \nPublic  Accountants,  needs  to  be  strengthened  and  greater  responsibilities  delegated  to  them. \nSpecification of roles and responsibilities of business associations as SROs and a road map for \ndelegation  of  such  responsibilities  from  MOF  will  be  included  in  the  new  Law  on  Independent \nAudit to be prepared by MOF and submitted to the Government Office in 2008, which will further \nenhance the legal framework for accounting and auditing services. \n \n\nc. \n\nBetter Market Infrastructure for Secondary Trading of Securities \n\n55. \nSecurities Depository. FSPL III addresses the need for improved market infrastructure. \nTo  strengthen  market  infrastructure  for  secondary  trading  of  securities,  the  Government  has \nestablished VSD as the central registry for listed securities with ownership evidenced by book \nentry. In addition, the Government has consolidated depository, clearing, and settlement under \na  single  entity,  VSD,  which  is  legally  separate  from  the  STCs.  VSD  will  serve  as  a  single \ndepository  for  all  tradable  securities,  including  government  securities  and  both  listed  and \nunlisted securities of public companies.  \n \n56. \nThe market infrastructure will need to continue improving with upgrading required on the \npart of the STCs, VSD, as well as private market participants. Systems of depository members \nwill gradually need to be linked with both the STCs and with VSD itself, and the VSD system will \nin  the  future  need  to  be  linked  to  the  designated  settlement  bank  (currently  an  SOCB,  but \nexpected  to  be  the  SBV  following  equitization  of  the  SOCBs).  The  volume  and  speed  of \ntransactions is constrained at the moment by dependency on a manual upload of orders at the \nSTCs.  In  addition,  VSD  reporting  of  settlement  vouchers  to  the  depository  members  is  also \npaper  based,  which  are  then  manually  uploaded  in  the  internal  systems  of  the  market \nparticipant.  Subprogram  2  of  the  program  cluster  will  support  full  implementation  of  automatic \nsynchronization of records between the VSD offices in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. \n \n57. \nGovernance:  Exchange  and  Depository  Institution.  Both  the  STCs  as  well  as  VSD \nwere established as part of the securities market regulator SSC, which in turn is part of MOF. \nFSPL  III  will  support  the  process  of  separating  the  STCs  and  VSD  into  legally  separate  and \ndistinct  entities.  HSTC  has  recently  become  an  exchange  incorporated  as  a  limited  liability \ncompany.  SSC  has  subsequently  approved  the  exchange  rules  relating  to  listing,  trading, \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nmembership, and information disclosure; and required HSTC to enforce these. Both HaSTC and \nVSD will become limited liability companies, with approval from SSC for their relevant rules. The \nprocess  will  continue  to  be  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  the  program  cluster,  in  the  form  of \npreparation by both STCs (exchanges) for ownership diversification and plans to address issues \nof ownership and good governance.  \n \n58. \nTrading Platform: Government Bonds. Since 2006, no new bonds have been listed at \nHSTC;  all  primary  auctions  of  government  bonds  are  to  be  undertaken  at  HaSTC.  The \nGovernment  is  considering  also  moving  the  auction  of  treasury  bills,  currently  undertaken  by \nSBV,  to  HaSTC.  However,  the  trading  platform  at  HaSTC  has  limited  capacity  and  currently \nboth  stocks and  bonds  are  traded  on  the  same  platform.  In  view  of  developing  the  secondary \nmarket  for  government  bonds,  HaSTC  has  submitted  a  plan  to  MOF  for  establishing  a \nspecialized  bond  trading  platform.  HaSTC  will  establish  the  platform,  following  Government \napproval and identification of appropriate technical system specifications. \n \n59. \nUnder the new Securities Law, SSC is to seek to modernize information technology for \nthe securities market, and will in the process develop an information technology plan to enable \nelectronic  filings  by  regulated  parties  (issuers,  public  companies,  regulated  intermediaries), \nsome  of  whom  currently  prepare  paper-based  disclosure  filings  for  submission  to  SSC  for \nreview.  Implementation  of  the  information  technology  plan,  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  \nthe  program  cluster,  will  enhance  SSC's  supervision  of  securities  markets  and  improve  SSC \ncapability to publicly disseminate information.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Framework for Securities Issuance \n\n60. \nFSPL  III  will  support  policy  actions  to  broaden  the  capital  markets  by  promoting  an \nenhanced  framework  for  securities  issuance,  increasing  the  supply  and  quality  of  assets \navailable  to  investors.23 Central  to  this,  in  the  short  and  medium  term,  is  development  of  debt \nmarkets,  starting  with  the  market  for  government  debt,  and  leading  in  turn  to  an  improved \nframework  for  subnational  and  corporate  debt  issuance.  Development  of  a  government  bond \nmarket  is  in  itself  a  complex  process,  and  will  require  continued  government  commitment  as \nwell  as  strong  support  by  both  subprograms  of  the  program  cluster.  Illiquidity  due  to  multiple \nchannels  and  methods  of  issue,  poor  predictability  of  expected  issuances  and  market \nconditions,  excessive  number  of  issues  and  absence  of  benchmark  issues,  and  lack  of  a \nbenchmark yield curve are prime characteristics of the debt markets in Viet Nam. Key elements \nof  support  in  subprogram  1  are  therefore  enhancing  government  securities  issuance,  creating \nbenchmark issues, developing the short end of the bond market, and promoting supply of other \nsecurities. \n \n\na. \n\nGovernment Securities Issuance to Support the Capital Markets \n\n61. \nPolicy Coordination: MOF and SBV. Increased coordination between MOF and SBV is \ncentral to improving securities issuance by minimizing conflict between the Government's cash \nand  debt  management  needs  and  the  central  bank's  open  market  operations.  The  timing  and \namounts  of  government  securities  issuance  may  not  always  coincide  with  SBV's  needs  for \nmonetary  policy  management.  Improved  coordination  between  government  debt  and  cash \nmanagement and monetary policy can assist monetary authorities through improved information \n                                                 \n23 Progress with ongoing equitization of SOEs will also affect development of capital markets and in turn be affected \nby it, in terms of ability and willingness of SOEs to list and raise capital in these markets. SOE reform is included in \nthe  program  loan  proposed  for  2007  to  support  implementation  of  Poverty  Reduction  Program  IV.  Another  loan \nproposed for 2008 would focus on SOE reforms and corporate governance. \n\n \n\n\fon intentions of the major issuer of debt in the economy, and also help the Government better \nadjust timing and amount of borrowing based on expected market conditions.  \n \n62. \nFSPL  III  will  support  the  formation  of  a  department-level  working  group  between  MOF \nand  SBV  to  improve  policy  coordination  for  production  of  liquidity  forecasts  and  designing  of \ngovernment securities issuance. The working group, to be set up by March 2008 following the \nreorganization  of  MOF,  will  agree  on  concrete  steps  to  produce  regular  liquidity  forecasts  by \nSBV  with  inputs  from  MOF  on  expected  government  expenditures  and  receipts,  and  issuance \nschedules by MOF for government securities, to improve the flow and predictability of assets to \nthe market. Subprogram 2 will support assessment of the feasibility of institutionalizing a public \ndebt management agency, and promote increasing the length of the government debt issuance \ncalendar to up to 1 year.  \n \n63. \nInformation  Dissemination:  Informing  the  Market.  In parallel, efforts will be made to \nimprove the production, dissemination, and quality of debt and budgetary information relevant to \ndebt markets. An internal task force will be set up in MOF to improve coordination within MOF \ndepartments on debt issuance, and to coordinate development of a credible government bond \nissuing strategy that will provide a clear picture of planned portfolio structure and instruments to \nobtain  that  structure,  including  identification  of  benchmark  issues.  The  internal  task  force  will \ndetermine  necessary  steps  to  undertake  government  securities  issuance  in  line  with  the \nobjective  of  promoting  capital  markets,  and  publish  a  calendar  of  issuance,  initially  on  a \nquarterly  basis.  MOF  will  introduce  quarterly  meetings  with  market  participants  to  exchange \ninformation on debt issuance and the debt markets, and to solicit investors' views on improving \nmarket efficiency. \n \n64. \nDevelopment  of  Primary  Dealers.  Current  government  auctions  of  bonds  are \nconstrained by interest ceilings, which reflect a concern against collusion among the few bidders \nparticipating  in  the  auctions.  Under  FSPL  III,  the  Government  will  undertake  a  study  of  the \nauctioning procedure to identify alternative auctioning mechanisms that are more robust against \ncollusive  bidding  and  develop  a  schedule  for  elimination  of  price  ceilings  on  government \nsecurities  auctions  as  well  as  the  framework  of  monthly  ceilings.  To  promote  market \ndevelopment,  the  Government  will  also  prepare  a  study  for  establishing  a  system  of  primary \ndealers in the debt market. \n \n\nb. \n\nCreate Benchmark Issues for Government Securities \n\nThe underdeveloped primary debt market and the stunted secondary markets ensure no \n65. \nmeaningful benchmark yield curve is available to help price other, riskier assets in the economy. \nDeveloping benchmark issues will help promote increased liquidity in the secondary market for \ngovernment  debt.  Under  FSPL  III,  the  Government  has  undertaken  three  benchmark  issues, \nincluding  one  in  May  2007,  on  a  pilot  basis  to  draw  lessons  in  broader  development  of \nbenchmark securities. In particular, the Government has reviewed its Decision No. 46/2006/QD-\nBTC  to  permit  large-size  issues  and  reopening  of  bond  issues,  and  will  revisit  Decree  141  to \nissue  guidelines  that  allow  for  buyback  of  government  securities.  These  will  enable  the \nconsolidation  and  restructuring  of  outstanding  debt  securities  to  create  fewer  issues  of \nbenchmark size in the market, to be supported in subprogram 2.  \n \n\nc. \n\nDevelop Short End of the Bond Market \n\n66. \nInterbank  Money  Markets.  Developing  a  benchmark  yield  curve  will  also  require \nstrengthening  the  short  end  of  the  yield  curve,  by  promoting  development  of  the  interbank \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nmoney  and  repo  markets.  Activity  in  the  interbank  money  market  is  constrained  by  weak \nincentives  for  liquidity  management  on  part  of  banks  due  to  factors  such  as  monthly  and \naverage  reserve  requirements,  and  high  levels  of  funding  liquidity  resulting  from  incomplete \nsterilization  against  surging  capital  inflows  into  the  economy.  To  enhance  the  incentives  for \nincreased  liquidity  management  by  banks,  it  is  important  to  ensure  excess  liquidity  in  the \neconomy is soaked up.24 As part of first tranche actions of subprogram 1, SBV has used open-\nmarket  operations  to  sell  treasury  bills  and  SBV  bills  to  absorb  excess  liquidity.  For  example, \nbetween  January  and  June  2007,  SBV  continued  to  issue  SBV  bills  to  sterilize  80  percent  of \nnearly  VND  100  trillion  equivalent  of  foreign  exchange  purchases  during  the  year.  Combined \nwith  increased  reserve  requirements  for  banks  these  actions  have  helped  absorb  the  excess \nliquidity, and the short term rates in the money market were fully realigned as of August 2007.  \nAt a structural level, segmentation in the money market, between SOCBs on the one hand and \nthe other banks on the other, needs to be eliminated. The segmentation is attributed to lack of \ncredibility  amongst  participating  banks,  a  problem  related  in  part  to  inadequate  quality  of \ndisclosure of financial data by banks, and also to strategic considerations on part of SOCBs to \nconstrain  the  rapid  expansion  of  balance  sheet  and  growth  of  non-state  owned  banks. \nInadequate profit motive of SOCBs, who hold the preponderance of liquidity in the system due \nto extensive branch network, is also a factor. This will be addressed gradually by the ongoing \nprocess  of  equitization  of  the  SOCBs,  who  may  in  their  new  form  seek  profits  from  greater \nliquidity access in the interbank market. Segmentation and heterogeneity in the money markets \nis  also  manifest  in  use  of  different  contracts  amongst  participants  for  repo  transactions. \nDevelopment  of  interbank  repo  markets  will  benefit  from  adoption  of  a  standardized  repo \ncontract  for  all  transactions,  and  SBV  will  initiate  the  process  by  guiding  development  of  a \nmaster repurchase agreement and using it for all SBV repo . \n \n\nd. \n\nEnhance Supply of Other Securities \n\n67. \nA  well-developed  government  bond  market  is  typically  a  forerunner  of  corporate  bond \nmarket  development,  providing  institutional  and  operational  infrastructure  that  can  also  help \ndevelop  corporate  bond  issuance.  Experience  with  benchmark  issues  and  development  of \ndealer communities and knowledgeable investors provide a useful base for issue and trading of \ncorporate as well as subnational debt. The Government has issued decrees guiding issuance of \ncorporate  bonds,  including  issuance  of  debt  by  equitized  enterprises.  Over  time,  promoting \ncorporate  and  subnational  debt  issuance  will  require  growth  of  credit-rating  and  bond-pricing \nservices in the market, although currently the market is too small to viably sustain such entities. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  the  Government  in  establishing  a  framework  for  promoting \ndevelopment of an independent credit-rating agency and an independent bond-pricing agency.  \n \n68. \nDevelopment  of  the  leasing  sector,  supported  by  FSPL  III,  will  result  in  evolution  of \nfinancially strong leasing companies that can contribute to and gain from issuing debt for both \nshort and long term. Leasing companies that are subsidiaries of SOCBs currently source all or \nmost of their funds from their respective parent banks; SBV has imposed a prudential ceiling on \n                                                 \n24  During  the  first  9  months  of  2006,  SBV  made  foreign  exchange  reserve  purchases  of  $2.9  billion  and  at  end  of \nSeptember 2006 foreign exchange reserves amounted to $12.1 billion. Each purchase of foreign exchange by SBV \nresults in the creation of an equivalent amount of dong liquidity. To eliminate the inflationary implications from this \ndong liquidity arising from the inflow of foreign exchange, that is to sterilize these inflows, SBV should have issued \nan equivalent amount of additional securities, namely D46 trillion up to September 2006. However the outstanding \namounts of SBV bills and treasury bills during 2006 rose by at most D10 trillion. As such the liquidity of the system \nhad  increased  substantially.  Until  the  end  of  2005,  overnight  interbank  rates  and  treasury-bill  rates  were  roughly \naligned with one another at about 6% but since then, with increased liquidity, the treasury-bill rates declined to less \nthan 4% while the interbank overnight rates were at or above 6%. See Dickie, P. 2007. Foreign Capital Inflows to \nViet Nam, mimeo, Victoria University and Southeast Asia Department, ADB, Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fthis  access  in  terms  of  10%  of  paid-up  capital  of  the  parent  bank.  However,  SBV  will  need  to \nreview the prudential requirements as leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term \nloans  of  more  than  1  year  at  viable  interest  rates,  and  relatively  few  have  been  successful  in \nissuing  medium-  or  long-term  debentures.  Leasing  is  a  still  a  new  product  in  Viet  Nam,  and \nawareness  of  its  special  security  features  is  limited.  The  ability  to  swiftly  enforce  ownership \nrights  through  a  summary  process  is  key  to  growth  of  the  industry,  particularly  self-help \nrepossession of leased equipment in cases of contract default. This right is already included in \ncurrent  legislation,  but  has  been  difficult  to  enforce  due  to  the  relative  novelty  of  the  industry. \nImplementing  rules  and  regulations  may  need  to  be  refined  further  to  improve  enforcement  of \nlease contracts in cases of default. At the same time, raising public awareness of the rights and \nobligations  established  under  a  lease  contract  and  enhancing  technical  knowledge  of  leasing \ncontracts  among  judges  in  economic  courts  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  will  be \nimportant  to  developing  the  industry.  FSPL  III  support  for  the  leasing  sector  will  complement \ninvestment lending by ADB to support selected leasing companies in Viet Nam.25 \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthened Investor and Consumer Protection \n\na. \n\nImprove Investor Protection \n\n69. \nAdopting IOSCO Standards. The new Securities Law adopted by the Government and \neffective from January 2007 is consistent with international best practice (IOSCO standards) for \nprotecting the lawful rights and interests of investors. Section 28 of the law provides MOF with \nthe  power  to  adopt  corporate  governance  principles  for  companies  traded  on  the  STCs.  To \naddress the potential for insider trading, the law contains a short swing profit prohibition against \ninsiders (members of management, general director, deputy general director, financial manager, \naccountant, and other management officers) who are prohibited from buying and selling shares \nof  that  public  company  within  a  6-month  period.  Under  Section  31,  shareholders  can  recover \nprofits gained from these transactions, which are deemed illegal. The law contains provisions to \nprotect  shareholders  during  a  takeover  (defined  as  the  offer  to  buy  voting  shares  resulting  in \nownership  of  25%  or  more  of  a  public  company\u2019s  outstanding  shares).  The  new  law  also  has \nprovisions for securities firms for enhancing investor protection.26 \n \nStrengthening  Surveillance  and  Enforcement.  The  challenge  now  is  to  maximize \n70. \nsound  implementation  of  the  new  framework  for  investor  protection  by  a  strong  and  effective \nmarket regulator. FSPL III has supported SSC in developing and implementing a master plan for \nimproving  its  capabilities  for  market  surveillance  and  monitoring.  Under  the  new  plan,  SSC  is \nundergoing  restructuring,  including  the  establishment  of  a  new  Department  of  Market \nSurveillance  and  Compliance.  This  newly-created  department  will  need  substantial  capacity \nbuilding  and  training,  supported  by  ADB  TA,  and  will  need  to  develop  a  framework  for \nmonitoring  STCs  and  clarifying  their  monitoring,  surveillance,  and  enforcement  activities.  In \nstrengthening  its  role  as  regulator  and  promoting  good  market  conduct  to  increase  investor \n\n                                                 \n25  ADB is proposing a nonsovereign loan in 2007 to an SOCBs that is parent of a leasing company. \n26  Article 62 of the law requires the general director and staff in charge of securities dealing operations of a securities \ncompany  to  be  certified  as  securities  practitioners.  To  become  a  securities  practitioner,  candidates  must  hold  a \nuniversity  degree  and  have  expertise  in  securities  and  securities  markets,  have  passed  an  exam  organized  by \nSSC,  and  be  employed  by  a  securities  company  (foreign  specialists  in  securities  markets  can  also  apply  for  the \nsecurities  practitioner  certificate  under  Article  79).  Licensing  applications  are  required  to  include  copies  of \nsecurities  practitioner  certificate  and,  under  Article  71,  securities  companies  are  required  to  set  up  a  system  of \ninternal  control,  risk  management,  and  monitoring  to  prevent  conflict  of  interest  within  the  company  or  in \ntransactions with customers. Article 71 also sets requirements and prohibitions in line with best practice principles \nrelating to customer priority, segregation of customer funds, know your customer, and capital adequacy. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nconfidence,  SSC  will  adopt  and  implement  a  web-based  system  to  facilitate  the  lodging  of \ninvestor complaints, which will be monitored and addressed in line with current procedures. \n \n71. \nTo  strengthen  compliance,  the  Government  has  issued  a  decree  on  penalties  for \nadministrative  offences  under  the  new  Securities  Law.  SSC  is  promoting  transparency  by \npublishing  on  its  websites  all  cases  of  penalties  imposed  on  regulated  persons,  including \nidentification  of  parties  sanctioned,  sanctions  imposed,  amount  and  type  of  sanctions,  and \ndescription of violations. This information will be made more user-friendly by consolidating and \ntabulating all information on cases and penalties imposed on regulated persons. After a period \nof  implementation,  subprogram  2  of  the  program  cluster  will  support  SSC  in  assessing  its \nimplementation  of  the  IOSCO  principles  for  investor  protection,  in  undertaking  identified \nremedial actions including using information technology more effectively to monitor compliance, \nand in implementing a public awareness program as needed on investor rights.  \n \n72. \nDeposit  Insurance.  To  protect  the  rights  and  interests  of  small  depositors  in  banking, \nADB supported Deposit Insurance of Viet Nam (DIV) in both FSPL I and II. DIV was established \nin  June  2000,  and  has  since  grown  significantly,  including  in  its  role  in  monitoring  banking \nactivities  supervised  by  SBV.  FSPL  III  will  continue  ADB's  involvement  with  deposit  insurance \nand  DIV  by  supporting  drafting  by  SBV  of  a  new  decree  on  bankruptcy  of  credit  institutions, \nincluding the role of DIV in the resolution process. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Anti-Money-Laundering Regime \n\nthrough  strengthening \n\n73. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  combating  money  laundering  and  Viet \nNam has now become a member  of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering.27 ADB has \nprovided  sustained  support  to  the  Government  on  strengthening  its  anti-money-laundering \nregime, and a financial intelligence unit, the Anti-Money Laundering Information Center (AMLIC) \nwas set up under FSPL II, which also promoted adoption of standard operating procedures for \nAMLIC.  FSPL  III  will  sustain  ADB's  deep  engagement  with  strengthening  the  anti-money-\nlaundering  regime  in  Viet  Nam  by  supporting  further  development  and  operationalization  of \nAMLIC \nimplementation  of  AMLIC  procedures  and  activities  by \nestablishing the prerequisite information technology system. The information technology system \nwill  be  used  to  collect,  process,  and  record  information  on  relevant  financial  transactions. \nFollowing approval of a feasibility study, AMLIC will establish the information technology system \nand  also  increase  staff  to  effectively  implement  Decree  74  and  its  related  regulations  for  anti-\nmoney-laundering. \n \n74. \nFSPL III will also support continued efforts to enhance awareness of money-laundering \nactivities  in  the  economy  and  strengthen  guidelines  for  implementing  the  existing  legal \nframework.  Under  subprogram  2,  AMLIC  will  coordinate  with  regulatory  authorities  to  develop \nguidelines on transaction reporting requirements and needed internal procedures to strengthen \neffective supervision and implementation of anti-money-laundering regulations.  \n \n\nc. \n\nEnhance Consumer Protection in Insurance Markets \n\n75. \nThe insurance industry has seen considerable growth and important achievements since \n2002,  including  a  legal  framework  specific  to  the  industry.  The  industry  has  witnessed \n\n                                                 \n27  Set  up  in  1997,  the  Asia  Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering  facilitates  the  adoption,  implementation,  and \nenforcement of internationally accepted anti-money-laundering standards as set out in the recommendations of the \nFinancial Actions Task Force. \n\n \n\n\fimprovement  in  the  expertise  and  effectiveness  of  the  regulator,  development  of  a  pool  of \nexperienced  insurance  professionals  through  training  and  education  of  staff  of  both  insurance \ncompanies and the regulator, and increasing acceptance of good corporate governance on the \npart of the regulator and the insurance companies. Two important decrees (decrees 42 and 43) \nhave  been  replaced  by  new  decrees  45  and  46,  which  deal  with  all  practical  aspects  of \noperating  insurance  companies  in  Viet  Nam,  from  license  applications  and  market  conduct  to \nsolvency  and  reserving.  The  new  decrees  need  to  be  supported  by  detailed  circulars  and \nregulations  that  have  not  yet  been  written.  These  will  include  a  wide  range  of  issues  from \nstrengthening  prudential  regulations,  improving  the  quality  of  information  flows  between \nregulator  and  companies,  and  improving  and  promoting  risk-based  supervision.  Two  circulars, \ncirculars 98 and 99, need to be revised.  \n \nTo  broaden  their  portfolio  of  products  offered,  which  is  currently  adversely  affected  by \n76. \ntheir inability to acquire long-term assets in the capital markets, insurance companies are now \nproposing  new  investment-linked  insurance  products.  FSPL  III  will  support  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  and  adopting  new  regulations  on  investment-linked  products  to  address  consumer \nprotection  by  regulating  selling  practices,  fund  accounting,  reserving,  and  solvency  related  to \nthe  new  products.  As  the  industry  moves  further  towards  risk-based  capital-adequacy \nsupervision,  the  existing  law  on  insurance  will  ultimately  need  to  be  amended  to  be  better \naligned with evolving industry circumstances and requirements. Subprogram 2 will support such \nefforts  as  well  as  initiatives  to  establish  more  equitable  treatment  for  foreign  and  domestic \ninsurance companies, particularly in the non-life-insurance sector. \n \n\nd. \n\nRegulatory Coordination to Improve Market Oversight \n\n77. \nAs  the  financial  sector  in  Viet  Nam  continues  to  grow  in  sophistication  and  become \nincreasingly  market  based,  the  Government  will  need  to  develop  a  comprehensive  framework \nfor regulation and supervision. The financial industry is operating in a conglomerate form, while \nthe regulatory framework is based on entity regulation, whereby a particular regulatory agency \nsupervises only particular type(s) of institutions instead of particular types of functions. A more \nfunction-based approach to supervision is needed, as well as a shift to risk-based supervision \nmethods, and to adoption of common risk-based capital adequacy approaches that minimize the \npossibility  of  regulatory  arbitrage.  Vigilance  is  needed  as  (i)  different  types  of  intermediaries \nbegin  to  target  the  same  market;  and  (ii)  one  type  of  intermediary  (e.g.,  banks)  begins  to \ndevelop subsidiaries to enable it to serve different (e.g., securities) markets. The regulatory and \nsupervisory  framework  must  allow  both  kinds  of  innovations  to  take  place,  but  consolidated \nsupervision  is  needed  to  mitigate  risks.  A  variety  of  institutional  forms  can  be  envisioned  for \nconsolidated supervision, and the Government will need to assess possible choices. \n \n78. \nFSPL  III  will  support  the  Government  in  improving  financial  markets  oversight  by \npromoting  increased  coordination  among  the  existing  financial  sector  regulators,  adoption  of \nrisk-based norms and supervision, and functional approach to supervision. The Government is \nconsidering  developing  a  view  on  the  appropriate  structure  of  financial  sector  supervision,  in \nterms  of  choosing  between  a  single  financial  sector  regulatory  authority  (as  in  the  United \nKingdom),  or  several  independent  specialist  regulators,  or  another  model  that  may  be  more \nappropriate  for  Viet  Nam.  The  Government  has  issued  a  directive  aimed  at  improving  the \nstructure  of  financial  markets'  oversight  and,  with  ADB  technical  assistance,  will  study  the \ninstitutional framework and arrangements to strengthen cooperation and coordination between \nregulators to enhance financial sector supervision.  \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\n24 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImproved Regional Cooperation in Securities Markets Regulation \n\n79. \nConsistent with the objectives of the Government to expand cooperation with securities \nmarket  regulators  in  the  region  and  elsewhere,  Viet  Nam  entered  into  memorandums  of \nunderstanding  with  securities  regulators  in  three  countries  in  2006:  Malaysia,  Singapore,  and \nThailand. 28  This  will  enable  greater  exchange  of  information  between  the  regulators, \ncooperation  in  surveillance  of  cross-border  activities,  and  cooperation  in  training  and  capacity \nbuilding.  To  expand  SSC's  capacity  for  better  tracking  of  foreign  capital  inflows  into  domestic \ncapital  markets,  SSC  will  develop  regulation  and  guidelines  for  foreign  individuals  and \ninstitutions on investing and on providing services in securities markets in Viet Nam. \n \n80. \nFSPL  III  will  also  support  Viet  Nam's  participation  in  the  IOSCO  MMOU.  The  MMOU \nestablishes  an  international  benchmark  for  cooperation  and  information  sharing  among \nsecurities regulators. Prior to signing the MMOU, member regulators must establish through a \nfair and stringent process that they have the legal and regulatory capacity to fulfill the MMOU\u2019s \nterms  and  conditions.  This  process  requires  an  extensive  review  of  the  potential  legislative, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  obstacles  that  prevent  a  full  exchange  of  information  among \nsecurities regulatory agencies. Additionally, this exercise\u2014through its identification process\u2014is \nexpected  to  provide  incentives  for  members  to  raise  their  respective  national  standards.  SSC \nwill  conduct  an  assessment  of  its  ability  to  meet  benchmarks  under  the  IOSCO  MMOU  and \nidentify impediments. Subprogram 2 will support Viet Nam to become a signatory to Appendix B \nof the MMOU. \n \nImportant Features \n\n81. \nFSPL  III  has  a  number  of  distinct  features,  starting  with  its  strong  alignment  with  the \nGovernment's  own  action  plan  for  development  of  the  securities  markets.  In  addition  to \nreinforcing Government ownership and commitment to FSPL III, this also reiterates ADB's role \nas  a  consistent  development  partner  in  promoting  financial  sector  growth  and  development  in \nthe country. Viet Nam's financial sector has been transforming at a rapid pace for a decade and, \nthrough  its  past  and  current  financial  sector  programs,  ADB  continues  an  active  role  in  both \npolicy dialogue and promotion of reforms.  \n \n82. \nSecond,  the  program  cluster  modality  allows  substantial  flexibility  to  be  built  into  the \ndesign,  while  also  acknowledging  the  importance  of  predictable  program  support  over  the \nmedium term. Recognizing that institutional change and market development are complex, time-\nconsuming,  and  nonlinear  processes,  the  program  design  encompasses  extreme  vigilance  to \nthe  need  for  realistic  targets  achievable  in  the  time  frame  of  FSPL  III.  Subprogram  1  of  the \ncluster supports policy actions that will seek to jump-start qualitative changes and processes to \nincrease  coordination  between  different  agencies  and  institutions.  These  may  be  particularly \nsusceptible in Viet Nam to plain institutional inertia and, possibly, vested interests. The impetus \nfor reforms would benefit substantially in such a context from invocation of external factors such \nas  publicly  announced  policy  commitments. 29 Once  initiated,  the  benefits  of  the  institutional \nreforms  are  expected  to  be  relatively  easy  to  build  upon  by  generating  their  own  momentum. \nFollowing consultations with the Government, therefore, the program cluster adopts an eclectic \ndesign  of  a  two-tranche  subprogram  1  to  be  followed  by  a  single-tranche  subprogram  2.  The \ntwo-tranche design of subprogram 1 is also motivated by the fact that the policy matrix for this \n                                                 \n28  A memorandum of understanding was signed with the Republic of Korea in 2002, and the PRC in 2005. \n29  Two other examples of such exogenous factors that are playing an important role in helping promote liberalization \nand  reforms  in  Viet  Nam  are  the  bilateral  trade  agreement  signed  with  the  United  States  and  the  commitments \nmade by the Government under its accession to the WTO. \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nsubprogram can be viewed as consisting of three broad elements namely (i) improved levels of \ntransparency, disclosure, and information standards; (ii) enhanced investor protection; and (iii) \nimproved  issuance  framework  including  development  of  the  bond  markets.  The  first  two \ncomponents are front loaded within the program and are thus reflected in the first tranche policy \nactions that have already been completed, while the third component will need more time and is \nmore prominent in the second tranche actions of subprogram 1. \n \n83. \nAid  coordination  and  harmonization  is  also  furthered  by  FSPL  III,  which  effectively \ncomplements other aid programs to support the financial sector in Viet Nam. Activities of other \ndevelopment  partners,  summarized  in  Appendix  3,  are  primarily  centered  on  supporting \nbanking,  and  rural  and  microfinance.  The  World  Bank  in  particular  has  provided  two  loans  for \npayment systems and bank modernization to develop the national payment system and the core \nbanking  systems  of  the  largest  banks;  the  second  loan  for  $49  million  is  ongoing.  It  has  also \nprovided TA to improve banking supervision, accelerate SOCB restructuring, and strengthen the \nregulatory framework in key areas such as asset classification and prudential norms for banks. \nThe  World  Bank  is  currently  proposing  a  Financial  Market  Infrastructure  Development  project \nthat  will  complement  FSPL  III  by  supporting  a  comprehensive  set  of  information  technology \ninfrastructure for SSC, Insurance Department in MOF, and financial markets more generally. \n \n84. \nFSPL  III  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB's  environmental  classification  system, \nwith no significant adverse impact identified. It will not have any involuntary resettlement impact \nas it has no investment component. None of the policy actions associated with it will trigger any \nactivities  related  to  indigenous  people  during implementation.  Summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial analysis of FSPL III is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n85. \nThe lending modality for FSPL III will be two back-to-back subprogram loans amounting \nto  a  total  of  $135  million  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $75,000,000 \nequivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1  of  the  program \ncluster. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The \nsubprogram 1 loan is expected to be utilized over 3 years and will be disbursed in two tranches: \na first tranche of $30,000,000 equivalent and a second tranche of $45,000,000 equivalent. An \nestimated $60,000,000 equivalent is expected to be needed to finance subprogram 2. \n \n86. \nThe overall loan size as well as tranching arrangements are determined by the strength \nof  the  associated  policy  actions,  their  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors \ncovered,  and  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government  as  indicated  by  MOF. \nAccording  to  MOF  budget  reports,  the  Government's  aggregate  financing  gap  for  2007  is \napproximately  $3.47  billion,  of  which  it  will  finance  $2.64  billion  through  domestic  borrowings \nand  the  remaining  $830  million  from  external  sources.  The  political  costs  of  implementing  the \nreforms are considerable, with vested interests benefiting from weak enforcement of regulations \nin  financial  markets  and  from  the  absence  of  adequate  risk-management,  supervision,  and \ntransparency. Although the benefits of the reforms will far outweigh the costs, the benefits will \nmaterialize only over time, while the costs are front loaded. In the absence of timely reforms, the \nfinancial  sector  will  continue  to  be  ineffective  in  intermediating  resources  efficiently  into \ninvestments, the financial sector and the economy will be vulnerable to systemic risks, perhaps \nmost  importantly  currency  and  maturity  mismatches,  and  investors  will  be  left  vulnerable  to \nmarket misconduct and fraud. \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n87. \nFSPL  III  implementation  will  imply  some  short-term,  direct  adjustment  costs,  including \nthe  following  costs:  (i)  restructuring  and  related  capacity  building  for  SSC  and  capital  market \nSROs  (i.e.,  HaSTC,  HSTC,  and  VSD);  (ii)  operationalizing  new  institutions  (e.g.,  AMLIC);  \n(iii)  establishing/upgrading  market-related  information  technology  infrastructure  in  supervisory \nagencies as well as SROs, which ADB and World Bank staff estimates place at approximately \n$30  million  (a  part  of  which  may  be  covered  by  a  proposed  World  Bank  loan  developed  in \nconsultation  with  ADB  (para.  83));  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  accounting  and  auditing  regime \nincluding the development of capacity in supervisory authorities and SROs, introduction of new \nstandards, and consolidation and strengthening of the legislative and regulatory framework. The \nshort-term, direct costs however do not incorporate the full impact of the policy package, which \nincludes longer-term changes at the level of institutions and processes. \n \n88. \nEach  subprogram  will  be  processed  sequentially,  with  subprogram  2  to  be  processed \nupon  completion  of  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  1  has  two  tranches  and  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted  14  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  Subprogram  2  will  be  presented  for  Board \nconsideration and approval based on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, and \nthe  readiness  of  the  Government  to  undertake  the  succeeding  policy  reform  measures.  The \nimplementation  period  for  subprogram  2  will  be  within  36  months  from  subprogram  1  loan \neffectiveness.  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n89. \nSBV  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  MOF,  including  SSC,  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency.  SBV  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation,  including  administration \nand  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and  preparation  of \nsemiannual progress reports on program implementation.  \n \n90. \nTo  coordinate  program  implementation  among  different  Government  ministries  and \nagencies concerned, a program steering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by \nSBV, will comprise senior officers from all government agencies concerned, including SBV and \nMOF, which includes SSC. The PSC will meet on a semiannual and ad hoc (when necessary) \nbasis  to  review  pending  issues  and  propose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to  ensure \ntimely program implementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will be formed \nwithin SBV, headed by a senior SBV officer, to assist the PSC and ADB, and have responsibility \nfor day-to-day program implementation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n91. \nThe implementation period for the program cluster is from January 2006 to September \n2010.  Subprogram  1  consists  of  tranche  1  (January  2006  to  September  2007)  and  tranche  2 \n(October 2007 to February 2009) actions. All actions included in tranche 1 were completed by \n30  September  2007.  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  be  implemented  during  March  2009  to \nSeptember 2010. \n \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n92. \nIn accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,30 goods and services produced in and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard \npublic  procedures  in  Viet  Nam,  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to \nADB. In the case of goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets, they will \nbe procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n93. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative \nlist  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6)  and  subject  to  expenditures  not  being  incurred  more  than \n180  days  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of \ncertification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the loan proceeds \nare  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development \nassistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  the  year. \nFSPL  III  recognizes  policy  measures  and  relevant  eligible  costs  already  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n94. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  SBV.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to FSPL III. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to FSPL III. \n \n95. \nThe Government is taking an active approach against corruption, and recently adopted \nseveral  legal  changes,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  A  steering  committee  against \ncorruption has also been set up, headed by the Prime Minister. The committee, which has the \npower to suspend officials suspected of wrongdoing, is already engaged in several high-profile \ninvestigations  whose  findings  will  be  made  public.  Results  of  investigations  against  corruption \noverseen  by  the  Government  Inspectorate  have  been  disclosed,  and  a  legal  framework \nestablished to protect and reward whistle-blowers against corruption. \n \n96. \nIncreased  transparency  and  focus  on  investor  and  consumer  protection  are  core \ncomponents  of  FSPL  III  that  will  contribute  to  lowering  corruption  in  the  financial  sector  and \ncapital markets. Introduction of improved standards of disclosure and quality of accounting and \nauditing  services  will  increase  transparency  against  corruption.  In  addition,  FSPL  III\u2019s \nanticorruption features include strengthening regulators to enhance surveillance and monitoring \nof securities markets, and increased coordination among regulatory agencies. \n \n97. \nits  management  of  public \nexpenditures. The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for the country was \nundertaken in 2000/01. A Public Expenditure Review \u2013 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-\n\nThe  Government  has  made  progress \n\nimproving \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n30  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n27 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nIFA) was subsequently conducted in 2004, which updated and reviewed implementation of the \nrecommendations  of  the  2001  CFAA,  and  also  suggested  reforms  in  other  areas.  Following \nthese,  the  National  Assembly  was  empowered  to  ensure  increased  government  accountability \nfor  use  of  public  resources,  and  to  seek  greater  transparency  from  all  agencies  using  budget \nresources, including SOEs, public investment projects, and statutory funds.  \n \n98. \nThe fiduciary risks of the current public financial management system are assessed as \nmoderate. ADB is participating with the World Bank, MOF,  and other development  partners in \npreparing  an  update  of  the  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  that  commenced  in \nApril 2007. The final report is expected at the end of 2007, and will provide an assessment of \npublic  financial  management  by  examining  budget  development,  execution  and  accounting; \ninternal and external reporting; internal controls; internal and external auditing; monitoring and \nlegislative oversight and scrutiny; and financial accountability risks.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe Government will prepare and provide progress reports on FSPL III implementation. \n99. \nADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment's withdrawal application. \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review  \n\n100.  ADB will, in cooperation with SBV, carry out periodic reviews of progress with program \nimplementation,  and  assess  the  impact  of  FSPL  III  on  the  sector.  The  implementing  TA  to \nstrengthen  program  implementation  will  also  be  used  to  continue  consultations  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  program  cluster  and  the  financial  sector.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB \ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave  implications  for  program  implementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals.  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n101.  The development of capital markets and a diversified financial sector will help mobilize \nresources and allocate them efficiently; the increased financial intermediation will help Viet Nam \nachieve and sustain its ambitious growth program. Well-developed capital markets will provide \ngovernment  and  private  sector  with  access  to  medium-  and  long-term  funds,  thus  enabling  a \nwider  variety  of  projects  to  be  financed  in  the  economy.  They  will  also  provide  competition  to \nbanking,  thus  contributing  to  increased  efficiency  of  banking  and  of  the  financial  sector  as  a \nwhole. Government debt market development will help the economy by providing a benchmark \nyield  curve  that  can  help  pricing  of  other,  riskier  assets,  and  contribute  to  development  of \nmarkets  for  other  assets.  Successful  development  of  debt  markets  will  also  help  increase \neffectiveness  of  the  monetary  policy  and  facilitate  improved  monetary  policy  management. \nIncreased investor protection in securities markets will benefit large as well as small investors, \nand  provide  households  with  mechanisms  to  invest  savings  safely.  Stronger  protection  for \nconsumers in insurance will benefit all consumers, while enabling new insurance products to be \nintroduced  to  the  market.  Development  of  the  leasing  sector  will  provide  access  of  firms, \nincluding  small-  and  medium-sized  firms,  to  alternative  sources  of  financing  for  their  capital \nrequirement.  \n \n\n \n\n\f102.  FSPL III will also have the benefit of contributing to improved institutional coordination in \nthe economy, particularly between MOF and SBV, as also between various regulatory agencies \ninvolved  in  supervising  the  financial  sector.  The  emphasis  of  FSPL  III  on  creation  and  large-\nscale,  web-based  dissemination  of  information  across  the  financial  markets  is  another \nsignificant aspect of institutional change, given the historical context of Viet Nam as an economy \nin  transition.  By  encouraging  a  movement  away  from  hoarding  data  on  presumption  of \nsensitivity, the implementation of FSPL III will help contribute to institutionalizing enhanced data \nand information availability, and transparency across other markets and sectors of the economy, \nas  well  as  government  agencies.  Equally,  the  benefits  of  FSPL  III  will  be  spread  across  all \nsectors  of  the  economy,  given  the  role  of  the  financial  sector  in  modern  market-based \neconomies. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n \n103.  FSPL  III  assumes  political  stability  in  the  country,  and  continued  adoption  of  sound \nmacroeconomic  policies  by  the  Government.  Given  the  track  record  of  Viet  Nam,  both  these \nassumptions are sound and defensible. Nonetheless, program implementation is still subject to \nthe following potential risks: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nExogenous  regional  financial  shock. The first risk is the possibility of a large \nexogenous  shock  in  the  form  of  a  regional  financial  crisis.  The  economy  is \nbenefiting  from  its  growing  integration  with  global  trade  and  financial  flows,  but \nthis  also  leaves  it  more  vulnerable  to  such  shocks.  However,  the  region  as  a \nwhole  has  rebounded  successfully  from  the  last  crisis,  whose  10th  anniversary \non July 2 this year saw stock markets soaring across the region, and high rates \nof  export  and  GDP  growth.  Concerns  at  this  stage  are  not  regional  per  se  but \nmore  related  to  global  imbalances  in  savings  between  Asian  countries  and \nothers,  and  spillover  effects  from  the  crisis  in  markets  for  subprime  mortgage \nlending.  Viet  Nam,  for  its  part,  has  a  very  sound  external  outlook  with  modest \ncurrent  account  deficits/surplus,  a  managed  float  of  the  Dong,  and  limited \nexternal  borrowing.  The  international  liquidity  crisis  that  evolved  from  the \nmortgage  market  in  the  United  States  has  also  not  had  any  major  adverse \nimpacts on Viet Nam. \nEquity  market  may  have  an  unsustainable  asset  price  bubble.  A  second \npotential  risk  relates  to  the  rapid  growth  in  Viet  Nam's  equity  markets,  and  the \nlikelihood  that  an  asset  bubble  has  developed  that  may  not  be  sustained.  A \nrecent  calculation  estimated  the  price-earning  multiple  in  HSTC  as  45.2, \ncompared with 14.5 for Europe, 16 for Indonesia, 17.2 for the United States, 17.8 \nfor  the  Philippines,  18.1  for  the  PRC,  20.6  for  Japan,  and  23.6  for  India.  Even \ndiscounting  for  possible  limitations  in  data  quality,  the  concern  of  high  price-\nearning  multiples  in  the  market  is  a  concern.  However,  this  has  not  deterred \ninvestors,  including  foreign  investors,  who  are  more  concerned  about  the \nappropriateness of valuations at initial public offerings (of SOEs) than the price-\nearning  multiples  per  se.  Nonetheless,  SSC  is  quite  aware  of  this  risk  and  is \nseeking to increase investor awareness. Of course, minor market corrections, if \nany,  would  help  strengthen  program \nthe \nimportance of high transparency and investor protection in capital markets. \nPolitical resistance and vested interests may slow reform. Implementation of \nprogram  initiatives  may  get  delayed  due  to  resistance  from  vested  interests \nopposed to the reforms. This risk is considered slight since the Government has \n\nimplementation  by  underlining \n\n29 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nincreased \n\nliberalization  and \n\nshown  immense  resolve  and  commitment  to  pursuing  the  reform  agenda, \nincluding  its  action  plan  for  development  of  securities  markets.  Government \ncommitment is also manifest in the scope of legal and regulatory changes it has \nalready  implemented  in  the  financial  sector,  as  well  as  of  proposed  reforms  for \nbanking and nonbanking financial subsectors. \nProtectionist  backlash  against \nforeign \ncompetition.  The  urgency  of  reforms  is  in  some  cases  associated  with \ncommitments  made  by  the  Government  in  the  process  of  WTO  accession;  for \nexample,  liberalization  of  foreign  entry  into  banking  has  focused  energy  on \nreforming  and  strengthening  state-owned  banks  and  partially  privatizing  their \nownership.  Similarly,  entry  into  nonlife  insurance  will  be  substantially  liberalized \nin  2008.  If  domestic  firms  are  unable  to  withstand  the  competition,  including  in \nnonfinancial areas of the economy, such reform could face organized opposition \nand  a  slowdown  or  even  reversal  in  some  cases.  However,  the  economy  has \nbeen  growing  fast  through  the  decade,  and  export  growth  is  strong;  the  risk  of \nperceived vulnerability to foreign competition appears low. \nPoor  governance  and  corruption.  This  could  erode  effectiveness  and \nimplementation of the reform initiatives. However, the Government is increasingly \nadopting  a  tougher  stance  against  corruption  and  recently  undertook  several \nlegal reforms, including enactment of the Anti-Corruption Law, and setting up of a \nsteering  committee  against  corruption,  headed  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The \nGovernment  has  also  established  a  legal  framework  to  protect  and  reward \nwhistle-blowers against corruption. Specific components of the program will also \ncontribute to reduction of corruption (paras. 54, 70, 78). \nInsufficient  technical  capacity  of  government  agencies.  The  last  risk \nconcerns  technical  capacities  of  SBV  and  MOF,  including  SSC,  which  as  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  managing  complex  institutional \nchange. However, the Government's record and ADB experience in the country \nsuggests  that  these  constraints  are  substantially  ameliorated  given  adequate \nsupport and technical assistance. To reduce this risk, extensive discussions have \nbeen  undertaken  with  the  relevant  agencies  and  specific  areas  of  assistance \nidentified. An ADB TA will be proposed early in 2008 to help strengthen program \nimplementation. \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n104. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nand  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix)  will \ncontinue to be in effect. \nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded in FSPL III subprogram 1 and specified in the development policy letter \n(including  the  policy  matrix),  and  will  ensure  the  said  policies  and  actions \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of FSPL III. \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\n105.

It  has  a  history  of  almost  two  decades, \n1. \nemanating  from  a  simple  monobank  financial  system  where  the  central  bank  did  all  the \ncommercial banking in the economy, and capital markets were virtually nonexistent. The reform \nprocess also has a complex canvas, as would be expected for economic activities that involve \ntrading  risky  financial  claims  across  time.  The  complexity  is  compounded  by  Viet  Nam\u2019s  later \narrival  in  the  rapidly  globalizing  financial  markets,  even  as  the  country's  reformist  ambitions \nencompass rapid integration into the global economy in its drive to reach industrialized country \nstatus by 2020.   \n \n2. \nWhile  Viet  Nam's  financial  sector  transition  is  not  necessarily  sui  generis,  sharing \nsimilarities  with  developments  in  the  PRC  for  example,  a  long-term  view  provides  useful \nperspective. Table A1 below summarizes the various stages in financial sector reforms in Viet \nNam and identifies key issues. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Summary of Financial Reform Process and Direction \n\nComments \n\n \n\nPeriod \n1986 \n\nUp to first \nhalf of 1990s \n\n \nSecond half \nof 1990s \n\n \n\n \n\nReform Focus \nThe \"Doi-Moi\u201c reform process launched to \nmove the centrally planned economy to a \nmultisector market economy \n  \nInitiating development of private \nenterprise.

Financial  reforms  for \nbanking  started  in  the  mid-1990s,  at  the  same  time  as  development  of  capital  markets. \nHowever, the pace of reforms across the financial sector has picked up considerably during this \ndecade. The Asian Development  Bank (ADB) strategy for financial sector development in Viet \nNam comprises long-term commitment through the finance sector program loans (FSPLs) and \nadvisory technical assistance with a focus initially on establishing the financial infrastructure and \nlegal and regulatory framework. \n \n4. \nThe  current  state  of  financial  sector  development  and  reform  indicates  continued \nmodernization  of  banking  and  a  transition  to  the  intermediate  stage  of  capital  market \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ndevelopment in the medium term. By the end of the third FSPL (FSPL III), the capital markets \nare  expected  to  be  characterized  by  improved  liquidity  in  key  areas,  extended  product  range, \nbeginnings of active secondary markets, expanded institutional demand through insurance and \npensions, increased domestic players including joint ventures, and enhanced transparency with \ndiminished regulatory interventions. \n \n5. \nOver the longer term, Viet Nam needs to continue reforms to move to the mature stage \nof  capital  market  development,  with  liquidity  in  many  areas  of  the  market,  extended  product \nrange  including  complex  derivatives  and  asset  backed  securities,  secondary  mortgages, \npresence  of  global  players,  and  full  transparency.  In  the  process,  the  Government  needs  to \ndevelop  a  vision  of  a  prospective  structure  of  the  financial  sector  over  a  longer  term,  and  to \ndesign  an  appropriate  regulatory  and  supervisory  structure.  In  particular,  regulation  and \nsupervision  need  to  be  consolidated  to  remove  any  opportunities  for  regulatory  arbitrage.  The \nfinancial industry is operating in a conglomerate form, while the regulatory framework has been \nbased  on  entity  regulation,  whereby  a  particular  regulatory  agency  supervises  only  particular \ntypes  of  institutions  instead  of  particular  types  of  functions.  For  example,  the  State  Securities \nCommission (SSC) regulates a brokerage subsidiary of a bank, but not the bank itself. Similarly, \ninsurance companies are regulated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and are planning to start \nissuing  investment-linked  products  similar  to  mutual  funds,  which  would  fall  under  the \njurisdiction  of  the  securities  regulator.  With  greater  financial  sophistication,  different  types  of \nfinancial institutions may move into a specific type of financial activity, and regulation needs to \nbe  function  based.  Regulations  should  also  ensure  prudential  management,  governance, \ntransparent trade, and fair competition within and between different conglomerates. To increase \ncoordination  between  different  regulators,  the  Government  may  need  to  assess  choices \nbetween a unified regulatory agency and specialist agencies with coordinating mechanisms.  \n \nB. \n \nViet  Nam's  financial  sector  has  seen  remarkable  growth  and  transformation,  but  is  still \n6. \nsmall  and  relatively  underdeveloped  in  comparison  to  many  economies  in  the  region.  Despite \nfinancial  deepening  in  terms  of  higher  levels  of  credit  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \nbroad  money  or  M2  to  GDP  ratios,  banking  continues  to  be  dominated  by  state-owned \ncommercial banks (SOCBs); cash is still the dominant mode of transaction; and capital markets \nare  small  with  underdeveloped  regulatory  framework,  governance,  and  transparency.  The \nmarket capitalization as percent of GDP in 2007 is 35%, and less than all the other economies \nshown in Figure A2.1. Government debt outstanding in Viet Nam is less than a tenth of that in \nthe Philippines, while debt outstanding in Malaysia is more than 25 times that in Viet Nam.    \n \n7. \nThe  sector  continues  to  transform  and  grow,  with  the  Government  committed  to \ncomprehensive economic reforms, which have tended to be persistent albeit cautious. Financial \nsector  reforms  are  now  gathering  momentum,  driven  in  part  by  increasing  interest  of  foreign \ninvestors and clear recognition by the Government that efficient financial intermediation is key to \nsustained high growth rates in the economy. Government commitment to real and substantive \nreforms  in  the  financial sector  is  greatly  reinforced  by  commitments  already  undertaken  under \nagreements leading to Viet Nam's accession to the World Trade Organization.  \n\nPerformance of the Sector \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39 \n\nFigure A2.1: Market Capitalization and Debt Outstanding, March 2007 \n\n  \n\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nb\n \n$\n \nt\nb\ne\nD\n\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \n \n\n%\n\nViet N a m\n\nP hilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nT hailand\n\nM alaysia\n\nIndia\n\nP R C\n\n \nSource: CEIC Data Company and Asian Development Bank Database System. \n\nDebt\n\nMkt Cap\n\n \n\n1. \n\nBanking  \n\n8. \nStarting  in  1989,  banking,  with  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV)  as  the  monobank \nconducting  both  central  and  commercial  banking,  was  changed  into  a  two-tier  system \ncomprising  SBV  and  a  system  of  credit  institutions.  The  separation  of  central  banking  from \ncommercial banking led to the creation of SOCBs followed later by establishment of joint stock \nbanks;  foreign  banks  were  allowed  to  establish  branches  starting  in  1994.  The  sector  now \ncomprises 5 state-owned banks, 37 joint stock banks, 5 joint venture banks, 31 foreign banks \n(branch offices), and two development and policy banks. In addition, nonbank credit institutions \ninclude  finance  companies;  financial  leasing  companies;  and  the  People's  Credit  Fund,  which \nfocuses primarily on rural areas and provides credit and deposit services with a limited scope. \n \n9. \nThe Law on Credit Institutions, adopted in 1998, provides the legal basis for operations \nof  both  local  and  foreign  credit  institutions,  and  provides  detailed  operating  guidance  to \nauthorized  bodies.  The  law  provides  detailed  stipulations  on  licensing  and  regulations  for  the \nbanking  businesses  such  as  refunding,  internal  audit  and  inspection,  SBV  supervision, \nprudential requirements, dissolution, bankruptcy, and liquidation. The law specifies powers and \nresponsibilities  of  credit  institutions  as  a  legal  basis  to  conduct  banking  operations.  The \nGovernment is planning to develop a new law on bankruptcy of credit institutions to refine the \nprocess of dissolution, bankruptcy, and liquidation of credit institutions. \n \nAlthough the number of banks has increased and lending in the economy has grown at \n10. \n29% annually since 1998, banking is still overwhelmingly dominated by the SOCBs although the \nextent  of  SOCB  dominance  is  declining  marginally.  The  share  of  SOCBs  in  total  lending  was \n69% in 2005, down from 73% in 2001 and 83% in 1994. The SOCBs accounted for 72% of all \ndeposits in 2005. The transformation in banking is also reflected in the declining share of SOCB \nlending going to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as well as expanded scope of their operations \nin  undertaking  market-driven  lending.  The  SOCBs  have  diversified  lending  to  other  large \ncorporations, while joint stock banks cater mainly to small-  and medium-sized enterprises and \nthe retail market. Nonperforming loans in the banking system are still high, although the exact \nmagnitude  is  not  obvious  due  to  existing  differences  between  the  Vietnamese  accounting \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nstandards and international standards. Using the former, nonperforming assets account for less \nthan 5% of banking loans, while other estimates place the nonperforming share at 5%\u201310%. \n \n11. \nThe  Government  has  undertaken  several  measures  to  reform  banking  since  2001, \nparticularly  focusing  on  addressing  the  issue  of  nonperforming  loans,  increasing  the  capital \nbase  of  the  SOCBs,  and  improving  the  accounting  standards  for  increased  transparency  of \nbanking financial statements. A credit information  center was established to rate clients' credit \nrisk,  although  it  is  still  at  a  relatively  new  stage.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to \neliminating  SBV  ownership  of  the  SOCBs  through  equitization.  The  fact  that  the  SOCBs  are \nseeking  strategic  foreign  investors  that  can  bring  in  technical  and  managerial  expertise  is \nencouraging. Financial consultants for the valuation of two SOCBs have already been hired and \nthe process for the others is ongoing. Two SOCBs are scheduled for equitization during 2007 \nand 2008, but on 10 July 2007, the Prime Minister directed Government officials to \"re-examine\" \nthe equitization plan of state-run enterprises in 2007, following a drop in price following an initial \npublic  offer  by  Bao  Viet,  a  large  state-run  insurance  company.  As  a  result,  some  of  the  large \nequitizations scheduled for 2007 may be delayed. \n\n \nFigure A2.2: Domestic Credit and Liquid Liabilities to GDP in Selected Countries \n \n\nDomestic Credit by the Banking Sector\n\nLiquid Liabilities (M3) as % of GDP\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n\nCambodia\n\nLow income\n\nViet Nam\n\nEast Asia and Pacific\n\nLao Peoples' Democratic Republic\n\nThailand\n\nCambodia\n\nLow income\n\nViet Nam\n\nEast Asia and Pacific\n\nLao Peoples' Democratic Republic\n\nThailand\n\n \n\nSource: World Development Indicators. \n\n \n \n \nForeign credit institutions are operating in the market as well (branches of foreign banks \n12. \nor  joint-venture  banks),  jointly  accounting  for  just  10%  of  banking  credit;  their  licensing \narrangements  restrict  the  range  of  services  they  could  otherwise  provide.

Currently, SBV is considered a \npart  of  the  Government,  which  sets  the  annual  targets;  the  SBV  governor  also  sits  on  the \ncabinet. \n \n\n2. \n\nNonbank Financial Sector \n\nIn  nonbanking  services,  insurance  and  leasing,  although  small,  have  grown  quickly  in \n\n14. \nrecent years. \n \n\na. \n\nInsurance \n\nThe country currently has 8 licensed life insurers and 15 licensed nonlife insurers, with \n15. \nabout  half  the  business  going  to  Bao  Viet,  one  of  four  state-owned  companies.  Although \naccumulated  insurance  premiums  are  still  below  2%  of  GDP,  they  have  grown  very  fast  in \nrecent years (at an annual average of 35.5% in 2003 and 18.5% in 2004, before slowing, Table \nA2.2).  In  2006,  life  insurance  premiums,  in  particular,  only  grew  by  5.5%,  whereas  nonlife \ninsurance grew by a more significant 16.4% over the previous year.   \n \n16. \nThe commercial insurance industry was established in December 1994. The initial rapid \ngrowth  has  slowed  in  the  past  2  years.  In  2006,  total  gross  written  premiums  grew  to  \nD14.9 trillion ($930 million), a growth factor of 9.9% over the previous year. The rough split of \npremiums  received  is  life  insurance  premiums  57%  and  nonlife  insurance  premiums  43%. \nCommensurate with this activity, the insurance regulator has become increasingly educated and \nexperienced,  and  strengthened  supervision  and  prudential  regulations.  A  major  task  has  just \nbeen  completed:  decrees  42  and  43  have  been  replaced  with  the  new  decrees  45  and  46. \nThese decrees deal in principle with all the practical aspects of operating insurance companies \nin Viet Nam, from license applications and market conduct to solvency and reserving. \n\n \n\nItem \nGDP (D billion) \nGDP per Capita (D million) \nGDP per Capita ($) \nAnnual GDP per Capita Growth ($) \nInsurance Premiums (D billion): \nLife Insurance \nNonlife Insurance \n\nTable A2.2: Insurance Subsector in Viet Nam \n2004 \n\n2002 \n535.7\n6.72 \n$439\n9.8%\n\n \n4,616 \n3,153 \n\n2003 \n613.4\n7.58 \n$489\n12.8%\n\n \n6,575 \n3,952 \n\n715.3\n8.72 \n$559\n15.0%\n\n \n7,711 \n4,767 \n\n2005 \n\n837.9 \n10.08 \n$642 \n15.6% \n \n8,044 \n5,535 \n\n2006 \n904.9\n10.89 \n$680\n5.9%\n \n8,483 \n6,445 \n\n                                                 \n1   Viet  Nam\u2019s  banks  suffer  from  low  public  confidence,  regulatory  and  managerial  weakness,  high  nonperforming \n\nloans, noncompliance with the Basel capital standards, and absence of international auditing. \n\n2  Initially, the regulation on foreign bank entry was restrictive. Licenses given for foreign bank branches were limited \nin time and these branches  were required to have a minimum local capitalization of $15 million. These branches \nwere  allowed  to  take  dong  deposits,  but  limited  to  $1.5  million.  Foreign  banks  were  also  limited  on  their  lending \namounts  to  a  single  project;  this  was  progressively  lifted  afterward.  On  1  October  1998,  SBV  harmonized  these \nlimits  across  the  sector  imposing  a  rule  that  limited  commercial  banks,  both  foreign  and  domestic,  to  maximum \nloans to single customers equivalent to 15% of their registered capital (now clearly interpreted as actual capital). \nLarge  foreign  banks  are  balancing  their  strong  interest  in  serving  multinationals  in  Viet  Nam  and  their  frustration \nwith continuing restrictions on their activities. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTotal Direct Insurance \nAnnual Premium Growth \nPremiums per Capita \u2013 D \nPremiums per Capita \u2013 $ \nPremiums/GDP \n\n7,769\n57.3%\n96,667 \n$6.31 \n1.44%\n\n10,527\n35.5%\n130,120 \n$8.39 \n1.72%\n\n12,478\n18.5%\n152,087 \n$9.75 \n1.74%\n\n13,579 \n8.8% \n162,350 \n$10.35 \n1.62% \n\n14,928\n9.9%\n179,600 \n$11.22 \n1.65%\n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Insurance Department, Ministry of Finance, Viet Nam and Vinare. \n\n \n17. \nIn  terms  of  nonlife  insurance,  Viet  Nam  has  yet  to  establish  equal  opportunities  for \ndomestic  and  foreign  companies.  Currently  international  insurers  only  represent  around  5%  of \nthe market. International insurers are restricted from insuring SOEs or Vietnamese nationals, as \nis reflected in the licensing agreement for international insurers. This is likely to change over the \nnext  year  or  so,  largely  as  a  result  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization: \nmost of the license restrictions are expected to be lifted in 2008. In terms of the life insurance \nsubsector, the mainstay product has been endowment insurance. In 2006, 87% of all new life \ninsurance  premiums  derived  from  the  sale  of  these  products.  The  industry  is  now  actively \nexploring  the  design  of  investment-linked  products  that  would  need  to  be  approved  by  the \nregulator. This approval depends on a regulation being written, which is estimated to take about \n12 months.  \n \nThese  products  do  not  represent  traditional  risk  insurance,  and  need  to  be  treated  as \n18. \ninvestment  products  rather  than  insurance  under  international  accounting  standards  (IFRS  4). \nInsurance  companies  have  recently  begun  making  long-term  investments,  and  the  authorities \nare  now  studying  the  introduction  of  investment  trusts.  Rapid  changes  are  taking  place  in  the \ninsurance subsector, which continues to thrive and become increasingly sophisticated. This puts \nincreasing  weight  on  the  role  of  the  regulator.  Effective  regulation  and  supervision  of  the \ninsurance  industry  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  promoting  its  primary  role  of  effectively  managing \nrisks for the economy, and its important byproduct of long-term savings mobilization. The latter \nis particularly relevant to life insurance markets. \n \n19. \nFurther  development  of  the  capacity  of  the  wider  insurance  subsector  to  take  on  the \nrisks  from  the  economy  also  depends  on  the  availability  of  sound  and  liquid  long-term  fixed \ninterest and equity investment opportunities. At this stage of development, the development of \nliquid  capital  markets  is  perceived  to  be  crucial.  This  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  effective \nstrengthening  of  regulation  and  supervision  to  ensure  a  sound  operating  sector  that  protects \nand  keeps  the  confidence  of  policyholders.  The  new  decrees  45  and  46  will  need  to  be \nunderpinned with detailed circulars and regulations. A wide range of subject matter will need to \nbe  covered,  ranging  from  providing  mechanisms  for  substantial  market  growth  (a  regulation \nauthorizing insurance companies to sell investment-linked policies), to strengthening prudential \nregulations,  such  as  publishing  and  enforcing  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d  requirements  for  directors  and \nsenior managers of insurance companies. \n \n\nb. \n\nLeasing \n\nThe  leasing  industry  is  another  potential  channel  for  financing  investment,  especially \n20. \nwhen  leasing  companies  have  access  to  long-term  funding  sources  such  as  a  liquid  capital \nmarket. This access considerably expands the scope for growth as it makes the leasing industry \nless  dependent  on  its  own  capital  and  on  bank  loans,  which  often  constitute  a  prudential \nconcern. The advantages of leasing over alternative forms of finance, such as secured lending, \ncan  be  identified  with  lower  working  capital  generation  needs,  simple  security  arrangements, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n43 \n\nand a higher match of finance contract term with the economic life of financed equipment. Viet \nNam has 11 finance leasing companies: 3 are joint ventures and 5 are subsidiaries of SOCBs.  \n \n21. \nFinancial  leasing  operations  are  governed  by  Decree  16  (May  2001),  as  amended  by \nDecree 65 (June 2005), Circular No. 8/2001 (September 2001) and Circular No. 6/2005 (June \n2005),  both  issued  by  SBV.  The  activities  of  financial  leasing  companies  are  confined  to  (i) \nfinancial  leasing  for  machinery,  equipment,  vehicles,  and  other  movable  assets;  (ii)  advising \nclients  on  matters  relating  to  financial  leasing  operations;  and  (ii)  other  services  related  to \nfinancial  leasing.  Preliminary  market  assessment  indicates  that  the  leasing  market  grew  at  an \nannual rate of 50% during 2002\u20132004, before slowing down to annual growth of 10% per annum \nduring  2005\u20132006.  Leased  assets  at \nthe  end  of  2006  are  estimated  at  about  \n$577 million. Leasing is still a new product, and enforcement of its special security features still \nneeds  to  be  improved,  in  what  seems  to  currently  be  the  most  pressing  issue  on  the  product \nside.  Basically,  the  ability  to  swiftly  enforce  ownership  rights  through  a  summary  process  is \nimportant for leasing as a product to overcome the usual barriers that stall bank loans. The right \nof self-help repossession of leased equipment in cases of contract default is awarded in current \nlegislation, but has been difficult to enforce in Viet Nam due to its novelty. Several implementing \nrules  and  regulations  may  be  necessary  to  make  this  key  security  feature  clearer.  Increasing \ngeneral public awareness of the rights and obligations established under a lease contract, and \nthe technical proficiency of judges in economic courts on this matter is crucial \n \n22. \nGaps  in  the  legal  framework  still  need  to  be  closed  and  some  of  its  aspects  need \nstreamlining.  Decree  65  permits  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  and  syndicated  leasing,  but \nimplementing  regulations  are  still  in  the  process  of  being  issued.  The  absence  of  these \nimplementing  regulations  constrains  leasing  companies  from  offering  a  wider  product  range \ntailored  to  enterprises\u2019  needs.  These  legal  and  institutional  shortcomings  do  restrict  product \ndevelopment activities. The other major constraint to growth of the leasing industry is funding. \n \nTransactions  in  foreign  currency  are  subject  to  SBV\u2019s  foreign  exchange  control \n23. \nregulations.  Finance  leasing  companies  are  permitted  to  mobilize  financial  resources  from  \n(i)  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  borrowing  from  credit  institutions  in  Viet  Nam  and  abroad;  \n(ii) issuance of bonds with a term of more than 1 year (subject to SBV approval); and (iii) other \nmeans  as  stipulated  in  Article  16  of  Decree  16.  In  addition,  long-term  funding  constraints \ndisproportionately bind leasing companies that are SOCB subsidiaries, because they source all \nor  most  of  their  funds  from  their  respective  parent  banks,  which  are  subject  to  prudential \nregulations. Thus, in general, leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term loans of \nmore  than  1  year  at  viable  interest  rates,  and  relatively  few  have  been  successful  in  issuing \nmedium- or long-term debentures. Opening access of the finance leasing companies to a liquid \ncapital  market  (stock  and  debt  exchange)  would  lift  the  most  significant  limitation  on  leasing \nindustry  growth.  Meeting  the  expectations  of  capital  market  investors  in  terms  of  information \nin \nquality  and  public  disclosure  standards  would  also \nmanagement quality. \n \n\ntrigger  considerable  upgrades \n\nc. \n\nCapital Markets \n\nSecurities  markets  were \n\n24. \ninitially  regulated  under  Decree  90  of  2003  (Decree \n90/2003/ND-CP  of  12  August  2003  on  functions,  tasks,  rights,  and  organizational  structure  of \nstate  securities  companies),  Decree  144  of  2003  (Decree  144/2003/ND-CP  of  28  November \n2003 on securities and securities markets) and Decree 66 of 2004 (Decree 66/2004/ND-CP of \n19 February 2004 on joining SSC into MOF. These decrees narrowly define securities markets \nin  terms  of  institutions,  activities,  and  products  offered  in  the  STCs.  On  29  June  2006,  the \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGovernment  adopted  the  new  Securities  Law  (Law  70/2006/QHII),  which  became  effective  on  \n1 January 2007. The law expands SSC jurisdiction to include unlisted securities; clarifies public \noffering  procedures;  codifies  the  disclosure  approach  to  regulation;  and  includes  a  framework \nfor  a  central  securities  depository,  investment  funds,  and  investment  advisory  and  self-\nregulatory organizations. \n\n \ni. \n\nStock Exchanges \n\n \nThe Ho  Chi Minh  City  Securities Trading Center  (HSTC)  was  established  in  2000,  and \n25. \nthe  Hanoi  Securities  Trading  Center  (HaSTC)  in  2005.  They  were  created  primarily  as  a \nmechanism  to  equitize  the  large-pool  of  SOEs  in  need  of  fresh  capital  and  governance \nrenovation.  Both  exchanges  started  operating  as  nonbusiness  units  attached  to  SSC.  HSTC \nstarted its operations with just five companies listed. By late 2004, it still only had 26 companies \nlisted with a total market capitalization of D3.8 trillion. All companies listed were former SOEs, \nwhich had issued public shares as part of the equitization program, before actually being listed. \nIn other words, very few companies had used the stock market as a platform for raising funds \nthrough an initial public offering. HaSTC was intended to serve SMEs. It was opened for listing \nof  firms  with  at  least  D5  billion  dong  in  chartered  capital  and  50  shareholders.  In  time  this \nobjective was superseded by the goal of turning it into the main debt market exchange for the \ncountry. \n \n26.  With  growing  interest  from  international  investors,  both  exchanges  have  grown  rapidly, \nparticularly in 2006; the index for HSTC (VNINDEX) rose from 307.5 in 2005 to 751.8 at the end \nof 2006, an increase of 144%, while the index for HaSTC, which is much smaller, rose by 152% \nfrom 96.2 to 242.9. Total company listings at the two trading centers have increased four fold, \nfrom 44 to 193, between the end of 2005 and end of 2006. During the same period, total market \ncapitalization  increased  by  almost  21  times  (from  D11  trillion  to  D231  trillion),  or  to  25.0%  of \nGDP  in  2006  compared  with  1.3%  at  the  end  of  2005.  The  extent  of  market  exuberance  is \nevident from noting that the Government initially set a target for combined market capitalization \nof  the  two  exchanges  at  10%  of  GDP  by  2010;  this  has  already  been  significantly  exceeded. \nThe  country  now  has  55  securities  firms  and  18  fund  management  companies.  The  regulated \nequity  markets  are,  however,  still  among  the  smallest  in  the  region3 and  substantially  small \ncompared  with  the  unregulated  market  for  trading  equity.  The  latter  grew  out  of  the  ambitious \nequitization program of SOEs, only a few of which listed in the formal exchanges.  \n \n\nii. \n\nDebt Exchanges \n\n \n27. \nThe  underdevelopment  of  capital  markets  is  particularly  manifest  in  the  markets  for \ngovernment debt, and even more so for the corporate debt market. Outstanding bonds issued \nby  the  State  Treasury,  Vietnam  Development  Bank,  and  municipal  governments  totaled  about \nD125 trillion at the start of 2007, which is an increase of almost 635% over the corresponding \nvalue  for  2002.4 Nonetheless,  the  outstanding  government  debt  represents  only  about  13%  of \nGDP.  The  primary  market  for  government  securities  is  highly  segmented  due  to  multiple \nchannels of issue and methods. The State Treasury of MOF issues more than 100 issues per \nyear  of  dong-denominated  treasury  bills  of  6-,  9-,  and  12-month  maturity,  and  bonds  with \nmaturity of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years through four channels. These are (i) treasury-bill auctions \n\n                                                 \n3   Market  capitalization  as  percent  of  GDP  in  March  2007  was  higher  in  all  other  countries  in  the  region,  e.g., \n\nIndonesia (37%), Thailand (65%), Philippines (124%), and Malaysia (180%). \n\n4   Compared with total outstanding debt of approximately $7.8 billion in Viet Nam, debt outstanding was $75 billion in \n\nPhilippines, $91 billion in Indonesia, $121 billion in Thailand, and $167 billion in Malaysia. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n45 \n\nthrough  SBV  with  SBV  as  the  registrar;  (ii)  bond  auctions  through  the  STCs  with  SSC  as  the \nregistrar;  (iii)  underwriting  through  syndicates  of  designated  banks  and  securities  firms  with \neach underwriter as the registrar; and (iv) direct placement or retails sales of bonds to the public \nthrough  the  national  network  of  600  offices  of  the  State  Treasury  with  each  office  as  the \nregistrar. In addition, SBV issues its own short-term securities for liquidity management. Banks \nare  the  largest  investors  in  the  primary  debt  market,  while  insurance  companies  have  a \nsignificant presence in longer-term bonds.  \n \nAlthough  nearly  three  quarters  of  outstanding  bonds  are  accounted  for  by  2-  to  5-year \n28. \nnotes, the small volume with large number of issues and absence of benchmark issues reduces \nliquidity of any given issue. The primary debt market is characterized by more than 400 issues \nlisted  on  the  STCs.  Illiquidity  of  the  issues  is  reflected  in  an  undeveloped  secondary  market, \nwith most investors buying debt and holding it to maturity. The market for corporate debt is also \nquite rudimentary, with only four large companies having issued debt until the end of 2006 with \ntotal outstanding corporate debt of D9.6 trillion, or 8% of public debt (one firm has issued debt \nas of October 2007). Issuances of debt by subnational entities are also extremely limited, with \nonly three municipalities having issued debt to date, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n \n29. \nInterbank  transactions  in  the  money  markets  are  also  still  in  the  rudimentary  stage  of \ndevelopment,  with  banks  more  likely  to  transact  with  SBV  than  with  one  another. The  SOCBs \nthat dominate the banking system, in terms of deposits, have been placing their excess liquidity \nat SBV through open market operations, at interest rates much lower (e.g., more than 350 basis \npoints  in  May  2007)  than  those  prevailing  in  the  interbank  transactions  among  joint  stock  and \nother banks.  \n \n\nd. \n\nMarket Infrastructure: Accounting and Auditing \n\n30. \nThe  accounting  system,  under  development  since  1996,  is  relatively  young.  Currently, \nthe legal framework for accounting and auditing is the Accounting Law, approved in 2003 and \neffective since January 2004. It has three implementing decrees: Decree 128 on public sector \naccounting,  Decree  129  on  corporate  accounting,  and  Decree  185  on  administrative  penalties \nfor  accounting  violations.  In  addition,  Decree  105  on  independent  auditing  regulates  auditing \nfirms  and  independent  auditors,  including  professional  qualification  and  certification.  As  of \nOctober 2007, MOF has issued 26 accounting standards and 37 auditing standards in line with \nthe  IAS,  but  more  will  be  needed,  including  for  different  financial  instruments.  Self-regulating \norganizations such as professional associations of accountants have a limited role in monitoring \nand maintaining standards in accounting and auditing practices \n \n31. \nThe accounting standards are being revamped to conform to the IAS, with 26 accounting \nstandards  being  created  so  far.5 A  new  general  accounting  system  was  adopted  on  20  March \n2006, with MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. These are natural developments in consequence of \nthe  very  successfully  backed  open-door  economic  policies  to  attract  foreign  investment.  With \nforeign  companies  now  doing  business  in  Viet  Nam,  internal  institutional  information  practices \nwill  be  driven  by  the  need  for  internationalization  and  standardization.  Policy-making  in  this \nfinancial  statement \ncontext  recognizes \ndisclosures  to  steadily,  albeit  cautiously,  adopt  international  standards.  Customers,  lenders, \nbankers,  and  investors  increasingly  require  information  that  is  truly  transparent.  Viet  Nam\u2019s \n\nfor  accounting  regulations  and \n\nimportance \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n5  Viet Nam\u2019s accounting standards are based on selective adoption of international standards with adjustments being \nmade  when the standards are not considered relevant to the current economic context or where local institutions \ncurrently lack the capacity for effective implementation. MOF has issued 26 accounting and 33 auditing standards. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\naccounting methodology may no longer be appropriate for financial reporting, particularly when \ndealing with international suppliers, bankers, and financiers. Understanding the financial status \nand performance of a bank is difficult if only such historical cost-based accounting is available. \nAccounting practice for banks should be revised in favor of more market-price-based accounting \nfor  bank  investments,  standardized  practices  in  the  allocation  of  expenses,  classification  of \nloans, and fixed-asset depreciation. \n \n32. \nBoth  auditing  and  public  disclosure  requirements  in  the  economy  have  substantially \nbeen raised in the last few years. All public companies have been required to publicly disclose \nannually  audited  financial  statements.  For  listed  companies,  these  requirements  are  coupled \nwith  additional  requirements  for  mid-year  disclosure  of  cash-flow  information.  One  recent \nupgrade  in  this  framework  requires  all  public  companies  to  meet  the  same  public  disclosure \nrequirements  as  listed  companies.  Of  course,  the  effectiveness  of  accounting  and  disclosure \nrules in sustaining a market economy is crucially dependent on the development of the country\u2019s \naccounting and auditing profession, and its capacity to respond to the needs. \n \nThe accounting and auditing profession, although still at an early stage of formation of its \n33. \ncertification  process  of  certified  public  accountants  (CPAs)  and  with  limited  effectiveness,  has \ndisplayed  impressive  growth  in  the  past  5\u20136  years.  Together  with  the  country\u2019s  booming \neconomy, the profession has grown dramatically in the past 5 years with the number of auditing \nfirms  increasing  from  9  (4  international,  4  state-owned,  1  private)  to  140.  Auditing  firms  are \nrequired to have a minimum of three CPAs and fall into two main categories: (i) a dozen or so \nfirms  licensed  by  MOF  to  provide  services  to  listed  companies  based  on  meeting  a  set  of \nthreshold criteria, and (ii) many smaller firms. Criteria to qualify for providing services to listed \ncompanies  include  minimum  capital  requirements  (about  $300,000),  number  of  clients  (30  or \nmore), number of CPAs (30 or more), and number of years in operation (3 or more). At least 12 \nfirms  have  more  than  12  CPA  employees.  These  larger  are  particularly  important  for  the \nfunctioning  of  capital  markets  due  to  high  accounting  and  auditing  requirements.6 Demand  for \nrecent graduates is very high; they are employed as accounting technicians in firms immediately \nafter graduation. Many do pursue the certification process to become a CPA after the 5 years of \nrequired  experience.  The  cost  of  certification  is  affordable  (roughly  $300),  and  professional \nperspectives are very attractive. The country now has more than 900 CPAs, with more than 100 \nnew CPAs passing the certification exam every year. The Government targets to have 1,500 by \n2010. Accounting and auditing firms can be formed by at least three CPAs.7 \n \n34. \nAlthough quality and capacity differ significantly in the profession, the increased number \nof CPAs is a very important achievement. Also, mechanisms are now in place for (i) continuous \nand  compulsory  upgrade  of  skills  and  certification,  and  (ii)  sanctioning  of  malpractice.  As  the \nVietnamese  Association  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  and  Auditors  is  strengthened  and \n\n                                                 \n6  All of the \u201cbig-4\u201d international accounting firms have a presence in Viet Nam and have played an important role in \nproviding services to the larger companies, and in providing the industry with a source of well-trained professionals \n(a  number  of  the  larger  local  auditing  firms  were  founded  by  former  big-4  staff).  As  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards  grow  in  complexity,  however,  many  of  the  smaller  firms  are  finding  that  effectively  responding  to  their \ncustomer  needs  is  becoming  increasingly  difficulty,  especially  in  areas  that  involve  international  best  practice \nissues. This is exacerbated by the fact that many CPAs lack sufficient command of English to take advantage of \nbackground materials available to help clarify interpretation issues.  \n\n7  While  the  number  of  auditors  has  grown  significantly,  demands  for  their  services  exceed  current  capacity.  The \ncurrent number of 900\u20131000 CPAs is expected to increase by about 50% in the next 3 years with some 150 new \nCPAs  currently  qualifying  each  year.  Requirements  for  a  CPA  include  a  relevant  university  degree,  4\u20135  years  of \nwork  experience,  and  passage  of  the  CPA  examination.  Continuing  professional  education  is  required.  Foreign \nqualifications  from  selected  countries  are  recognized  and  individuals  possessing  such  credentials  can  practice \nprovided they pass the exam. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n47 \n\nturned into a self-regulated organization, these mechanisms are expected to be more effective \nin  raising  the  standards  of  professional  practice.  One  such  rule  for  example  that  will  likely \nbecome  more  effective  as  a  result of  a  stronger  Vietnamese  Associations  of  Chartered  Public \nAccountants is the requirement for rotation of auditors dictated by Circular 64, Decree 105.8 \n \n35. \nSupervision of the profession is done primarily through the firm rather than by individuals \n(CPAs  can  only  practice  through  a  firm)  and  auditing  firms  are  required  to  annually  reregister \nwith both MOF and Vietnam Association of CPAs. Quality control over auditing services is being \ntightened,  and  MOF  and  SSC  have  developed  procedures  for  and  begun  implementation  of \nregular  on-site  and  off-site  examinations  of  audit  firms.  The  legal  framework  for  auditing \ncurrently  contained  in  a  number  of  decrees  and  decisions  is  expected  to  be  consolidated  and \nstrengthened through enactment of a law on independent audit. The audit partner is required to \nrotate  every  3  years.  MOF  is  preparing  and  will  shortly  issue  accounting  guidelines  for  STCs, \nsecurities firms, and fund management companies. It is also planning to realign the accounting \nsystem  for  credit  institutions  with  international  norms,  including  the  leasing  subsector;  and \nefforts are under way to adopt the concepts under IAS 32 (financial instruments: disclosure and \npresentation)  and  IAS  39  (financial  instruments:  recognition  and  measurement)  in  a  phased \nmanner. \n \n36. \nFurther  financial  sector  development  to  enhance  capital  markets  is  currently  in  early \nstages of development, with substantial illiquidity; limited range of products; a poor base of long-\nterm institutional investors comprising primarily insurance companies and domestic participant;, \nan underdeveloped infrastructure; and poor transparency and investor protection. Development \nof the capital markets will need to increase the supply of assets available in the markets, as well \nas  deepen  them  by  increasing  the  investor  pool  through  increased  investor  and  consumer \nprotection.  In  addition,  the  price  discovery  role  of  the  markets  will  need  to  be  enhanced  by \nlowering information and trading costs, and improving transparency (Figure A2.3). \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Responsibility  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  profession  is  shared  between  MOF  and  the  Vietnam \nAssociation  of  CPAs  (VACPA).  MOF\u2019s  Accounting  Department  is  responsible  for  issuance  of  standards  and \nregulations,  while  SSC  has  supervisory  responsibility  over  auditing  firms  licensed  to  provide  services  to  listed \ncompanies,  and  VACPA  is  responsible  for  supervision  of  other  firms.  VACPA  is  a  relatively  young  organization  \n(2 years old) and is in the process of building its own capacity (it currently has 14 full-time staff in Ho Chi Minh City \nand  8  in  Hanoi,  in  addition  to  20  part-time  staff).  As  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  grow  in \ncomplexity, MOF and VACPA must ensure they have sufficient capacity to develop appropriate local standards and \nguidelines and effectively supervise their implementation. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nFigure A2.3: Development of Securities Markets in Viet Nam \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n \n

\n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe  financial  sector  plays  a  powerful,  through  indirect  role  in  reducing  poverty  by  facilitating  long-term \neconomic growth. Growth, however, is not necessarily pro-poor and entails change, which the poor may \noften not be  well-equipped to cope with. A well-governed  financial sector that facilitates competition can \nhelp  make  growth  more  user\u2013friendly  by  (i)  improving  access  to  savings,  credit,  and  insurance \ninstruments, which enable the poor to cushion shocks as well as take advantage of opportunities created \nby change; and (ii) allowing for better terms on those instruments. \n \nA well-governed financial sector also reduces the likelihood and severity of financial and economic crises \nand consequently helps safeguard against a corresponding marked increase in the incidence of poverty. \nBalanced  financial  sector  development  can  promote  financial  system  stability  and  strengthening  by \nallowing  risks  to  be  more  evenly  spread  among  types  of  financial  institutions  and  spurring  competition \nbetween them. \n \n\nB.
