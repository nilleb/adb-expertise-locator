(Ooredoo) for the Nationwide Data Connectivity Project \nin Myanmar. \n \n2. \nThe  loan  will  finance  the  rolling  out  of  fixed  and  wireless  broadband  services  and \nupgrading of Ooredoo\u2019s mobile telecommunications networks in Myanmar.1 The project is being \ndeveloped under a 15-year operating and associated spectrum license on a build\u2013own\u2013operate \nbasis  that  authorizes  Ooredoo  to  provide  a  full  range  of  fixed  and  mobile  telecommunications \nservices nationwide. The project will benefit the Myanmar population by increasing the availability \nand quality of telecommunications and data connectivity services throughout the country, which \nwill  lead  to  greater  sustainable  socioeconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  As  a  project \nclassified  gender  equity  as  a  theme,  it  will  advance  inclusive  sustainable  development  by \npromoting  the  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  support  of  gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  Universal  access  to  ICT  is  critical  in  fostering  a  country\u2019s \nsocioeconomic growth and is at the heart of economic growth and development. In addition to the \ndirect benefits, scaling up investments in telecommunications infrastructure will (i) improve access \nto  domestic  and  regional  markets,  (ii)  attract  private  investment,  (iii)  reduce  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment  gaps,  and  (iv)  help  reap  gains  from  regional  connectivity  and  integration.  The \nexpansion  of  telecommunications  coverage  in  remote  villages  will  provide  the  rural  poor  with \nmobile and data access to enable better communication with families and communities; access \nto information, news, and education; and better delivery of government services. Overall, this will \nstimulate  economic  development,  providing  access  to  improved  jobs  and  small-to-medium \nbusiness opportunities. \n\n \n\nDecades of isolation have led Myanmar to become one of the least connected countries \n4. \nin Southeast Asia\u2014for every 100 people, only seven had access to a mobile phone, 0.5 had fixed \ntelephone lines, and 0.7 had a broadband internet subscription in 2013.2 Myanmar liberalized its \nmobile telecommunications market in 2013, opening it to foreign investment. Following one of the \nmost competitive international tenders with more than 90 applicants, the Government of Myanmar \nawarded  telecommunications  operating  and  associated  spectrum  licenses  to  Qatar's  Ooredoo \nand Norway's Telenor Group in June 2013. Since then, there has been a significant change to \nthe telecommunications industry with the mobile penetration rate rising from 7% in 2013 to nearly \n90%  in  2017.  By  the  end  of  2017,  the  number  of  mobile  subscribers  in  Myanmar  reached  50 \nmillion,  and  smartphone  penetration  rates  soared  to  more  than  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  mobile \nconnections. \n \nAlthough  Myanmar's  telecommunications  market  leapfrogged  from  analog  to  the  digital \n5. \nera  in  a  short  period  of  time,  substantial  investments  are  required  to  upgrade  its  mobile \n                                                \n1  Ooredoo provides nationwide coverage of second- and third-generation mobile telecommunications networks, and \n\nis rolling out a fourth-generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network across the country. \n\n2  Government  of  Myanmar,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2013. \n\nInformation  Memorandum \n\n(Telecommunications Operator Tender Evaluation and Selection Committee). Nay Pyi Taw. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftelecommunications  networks,  including  the  nationwide  rollout  of  a  fourth-generation  (4G) \nnetwork, to enhance their speed and capacity for transferring data. This will enable broadband \ninternet,  e-mail,  and  enriched  mobile  applications  in  addition  to  conventional  voice  and  text \nservices.  Furthermore,  as  the  broadband  market  remains  highly  underdeveloped  with  a \npenetration  rate  of  less  than  2%,  rapid  expansion  of  fixed  and  wireless broadband  services  is \nrequired to cater to the exponential increase in demand for data connectivity from businesses and \nhouseholds. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  opportunity  of  providing  financial \n6. \nassistance to Ooredoo to support its expansion into fixed and wireless broadband services and \nthe upgrade of its mobile telecommunications networks through proactive engagement and strong \nrelationships with key telecommunications players in Myanmar. The goal is to implement ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  and  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132021  for  Myanmar,  which  emphasize \nsupport  for  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  projects  in  new  communication \ntechnologies and the mobilization of private sector resources for innovation and job creation.3 By \nassisting Ooredoo in its next phase of expansion, ADB is supporting the company\u2019s drive toward \nenhancing data connectivity in Myanmar, which is the next phase of development after completing \nthe rollout of basic telecommunications infrastructure that provides conventional voice and text \nservices. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7. \n \n \n8. \nBorrower. Headquartered in Qatar and established in 1987, Ooredoo is a leading global \ntelecommunications company that serves almost 130 million customers. Ooredoo has significant \ngeographic diversification, with operations in 10 markets across Asia, the Middle East, and North \nAfrica. Ooredoo has leading market positions in most of the markets in which it operates.

The project will improve access to quality telecommunications services and will \nalso contribute to raising the mobile and broadband internet  penetration rates to enable better \naccess to information, knowledge, and social and economic opportunities. Through ADB\u2019s active \nengagement  in  incorporating  gender  elements  into  the  project  design,  the  project  (classified \ngender equity as a theme) will promote gender-equitable access; facilitate inclusive growth and \npoverty reduction; and contribute to the National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women, \nwhich calls for improving systems, structures, and practices to ensure women\u2019s equal participation \nin decision making and leadership at all levels of society.5 \n \n\nProject design.

ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nlong-term corporate strategy  (Strategy 2030), which identifies gender equality as one of seven \noperational  priority  areas.  Strategy  2030  also  emphasizes  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure projects in new communication technologies and the mobilization of private sector \nresources for innovation and job creation. \n \nConsistency with country strategy.

The  Private  Sector  Operations  Department\u2019s \nextended annual review of phases 1\u20133 of the Roshan Cellular Telecommunications Project found \nthe presence of underserved populations to be the main driver of growth in telecommunications \nin Afghanistan; it rated ADB\u2019s private sector development impact excellent as Roshan\u2019s mobile \nsubscriber base grew from 158,000 in 2004 to 5 million in 2011 with greatly increased coverage.7 \nADB\u2019s  previous  operations  in  nascent  and  frontier  telecommunications  markets  such  as \nAfghanistan and Myanmar (footnote 5) show that (i) infrastructure investments led by the private \nsector can be undertaken successfully and sustained in sectors that promote market competition \nand transparency and (ii) ADB\u2019s continuous and active engagement has a strong catalytic and \ndevelopment impact in promoting private sector investment and healthy competition. \n \nD. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n \n15. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is the oversight \nauthority for the telecommunications sector in Myanmar, and the Posts \nand Telecommunications Department (PTD) under the MOTC is the \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.
