It will improve the environment and promote economic \ngrowth  in  rural  areas  of  Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi  provinces. \nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  support  to  small  household  farms \nthrough  the  development  of  an  integrated  farm  production  system  by \nexpanding  livestock,  vegetable,  fruit,  and  other  crop  production  and \nestablishing on-farm biogas digesters and biomass gasification plants to \ngenerate  clean,  renewable  energy.  Agricultural  wastes  from  both  crops \nand  animals  will  fuel  the  biogas  digesters  and  biomass  gasification \nplants. These activities will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve \nthe  environment,  increase  household  incomes,  and  reduce  poverty  in \nthe  rural  areas.  Technical  support  and  training  will  be  provided  to \npromote  and  improve  biomass  technology  and  to  establish  adequate \nservice  infrastructure  to  ensure  sustainability  and  biomass  system \ndevelopment  in  rural  areas.  Special  efforts  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that \npoor and disadvantaged farmers and women participate in all aspects of \nproject activities. \n \nPoverty Intervention \n \nThe proportion of poor among the project beneficiaries will be about 26 \npercent,  which  is  higher  than  the  estimated  12  percent  poor  for  the \noverall population of the PRC.  \n \nThematic:  Environment Protection \n \nThe  environmental  benefits  of  the  Project  will  include  reduction  of \ncarbon  dioxide  and  sulphur  dioxide  emissions,  nonpoint  pollution  from \nintensive  livestock  production,  and  decreased  exploitation  of  forests  for \nfuelwood.  The  benefits  will  also  include  improved  health  of  the  rural \npopulation  and \nforests  and  vegetative  coverage  of \nincreased \nnonproductive lands with pasture and tree crops.  \n \nCategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken, and a \nsummary initial environmental evaluation was prepared. \n \nImproving  the  PRC\u2019s  environment  is  possible  through  promotion  and \nadoption  of  sustainable  biomass  technology  for  efficient  utilization  of \nagricultural  wastes  to  generate  cleaner  biomass  energy.  This  will  also \nlead  to  improved  natural  resource  management  at  the  farm  level, \ngenerating  benefits  for  rural  households,  the  environment,  and  the \neconomy.  At  present,  large  quantities  of  agricultural  wastes  are \ndisposed off inappropriately (e.g., burning of crop residues in open fields \nor discharge of animal wastes, polluting streams and groundwater). This \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n  \n\nfarming \n\nis not only harmful for the environment, but constitutes a loss of potential \nenergy  and  nutrient  resources,  which  could  add  value  to  integrated \nfarming systems, reduce farm input costs, and provide opportunities for \nintegrated  pest  management  and  organic \ntechniques. \nDevelopment of a clean energy source like biogas digesters will reduce \nthe  dependence  of  farm  households  on  coal,  straw,  and  firewood  for \nheating  and  cooking,  thus  promoting  a  better  living  environment, \nimproved  health  from  reduced  air  pollution,  and  less  stress  on  forest \nresources.  Integrated  agricultural  production  systems  with  biomass \ntechnology  have  proven  to  be  an  effective  means  to  generate  cleaner, \nrenewable energy for environmental improvement as well as to improve \nthe  quantity  and  quality  of  farm  outputs.  However,  biomass  technology \nfaces numerous constraints and barriers for mass adoption, particularly \nin  rural  areas.  These  barriers  include  shortage  of  credit  facilities,  weak \ninstitutional  and  technical  expertise,  inadequate  service  infrastructure, \nlack  of  environmental  awareness,  and  few  policy  incentives.  Farmers \nface  constraints  in  obtaining  access  to  credit  for  the  adoption  of \nbiomass-based  renewable  energy  systems  to  integrate  with  existing \nfarming  practices.  Current  interest  rates  in  the  PRC  are  set  at  levels \nbelow  market  rates,  creating  excess  demand  within  which  rural \ninvestments  have  received  low  priority.  As  a  consequence,  farmers \ncannot  access  longer  term  loans  with  the  grace  period  necessary  for \nrural capital investments, which require time to generate a positive cash \nflow.  The  commercial  financial  institutions  and  banks  are  not  certain \nabout  the  viability  of  biogas  systems  and  do  not  provide  longer  term \ncredit  to  large  numbers  of  small  farmers.  This  Project  will  overcome \nthese major constraints and barriers. It represents a significant effort to \npromote  renewable  energy  generation  to  improve  the  environment, \nenhance the quality and quantity of agricultural production, and improve \nthe  health  and  income  of  rural  farmers.  It  will  also  serve  as  a \ndemonstration project, showing the feasibility and profitability of adoption \nof  biomass  technology  as  well  as  promoting  private  entrepreneurs  to \nparticipate  in  larger  scale  biomass  technology  for  biogas  production. \nPrivate  sector  service  technicians  and  facilities  will  be  enhanced  to \nensure sustainability of the biogas technology adoption. \n \nThe Project\u2019s objectives are to improve the environment and to promote \neconomic  growth  to  improve  the  welfare  and  living  conditions  of  rural \nhouseholds  by  generating  cleaner  biomass  energy  and  increasing \nagricultural productivity through efficient utilization of agricultural wastes. \nThe Project has six components: \n \n(i) \n\nFunding  for  Renewable  Energy  Generation  and  Eco-\nEnvironment  Development:  This  component  will  develop  a \nviable,  sustainable,  and  replicable  financing  model  and  will \norganize  and  provide  credit \nrural \nhouseholds  as  well  as  to  medium-scale  enterprises  for  the \nadoption  of  biomass-based \nrenewable  energy  systems \nfarming  practices.  The  biomass \nintegrated  with  existing \ntechnology  will  produce  cleaner  biogas  for  cooking  and  lighting \nas well as improve and increase farm produce. This component \n\nthrough  subloans \n\nto \n\nObjective and \nScope \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\niv\n\n  \n\nwill  ensure  efficient  management  of  project  subloans  for \nrehabilitating  and  constructing  15,600  of  small-scale  farms \nincorporating  biogas  digesters  and  42  units  of  medium-scale \nbiogas and gasification plants. \n\ntechnology \n\nTransferring \n\nto  acquire  biomass \n\nImprove  Mechanisms \nBiomass \nfor \nTechnology: This  component  will  address  technical  barriers  to \nbiomass  technology  adoption  through  provision  of  training  to \ntechnicians  as  well  as  project \nbiogas  contractors  and \nbeneficiaries \nfor  biogas \nproduction.  The  component  will  also  help  to  strengthen  the \nprivate service sector for the operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof farmers\u2019 biogas digesters, including access to spare parts, to \nensure  the  sustainability  of  biomass  technology  adoption. \nWorkshops, study tours, and fellowships will be provided to help \nin  the  transfer  of  biomass  technology.  Project  officials  and \nprivate  sector  businesses  will  be  trained  in  key  aspects  of \nbiomass  systems  including  provision  of  extension  services, \nestablishment  of  effective  service  and  marketing  industries, \ndevelopment  of  a  pricing  policy  for  project  outputs,  and  O&M \nthat  integrates  biomass  technology  adoption  with  farming \nsystem operation to ensure sustainability and replicability.  \n\nRehabilitate  Farmers\u2019  Selected  Farm-to-Market  Facilities: \nThis  component  will  rehabilitate  rural  roads  and  bridges  to  link \nagricultural production areas to the urban markets. It will help to \nincrease  access  to  markets,  provide  extension  of  services  and \nO&M,  reduce  transportation  costs,  and  lessen  damage  to \nin \nfarmers \nvegetable  outputs \ndisadvantaged  areas.  The \nfacilities  will \nstrengthen  service  infrastructure  and  provide  better  and  easier \naccess  of  technical  specialists  and  provision  of  spare  parts \nnecessary  for  the  sustainable  O&M  of  biogas  digesters  and \ngasification plants. \n\nfaced  by  small  and  poor \n\nfarm-to-market \n\nImplementation \n\nImprove  Environment  Policy \nand \nAwareness:  This  component  will  help  to  remove  institutional \nbarriers to the promotion and expansion of biomass technology \nadoption for environmental improvement and public awareness. \nIt  will  provide  technical  support  to  assist  the  four  provincial \ngovernments  in  removing  barriers  to  environment  improvement \nas  well  as  to  provide  environmental  monitoring  facilities  to \nassure  high  environmental  standards  for  air,  water,  soil,  and \nother elements and to highlight beneficial environmental impact. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  four  environmental  support  elements: \n(i) creating a receptive environment through the application of a \ncomprehensive public awareness campaign on the project goals \nand  activities,  (ii)  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \nenvironment  to  highlight  the  positive  impacts  from  a  cleaner \nenergy  source,  (iii)  enabling  the  farmers  to  become  green  food \nproducers  associated  with  biomass  technology  adoption,  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\nv\n\n  \n\n(iv)  facilitating  biomass  technology  adoption  by  small  and  poor \nfarmers and private businesses. \n\nfor \n\nApproaches \n\nPoverty-Focused \n\nPilot \nBiomass \nDevelopment:  This  component  will  remove  constraints  to \nparticipation  by  large  numbers  of  poor  farmers  in  rural  areas. \nThere are significant numbers of poor living in rural areas. The \npoor  use  coal  and  firewood,  which  contribute  to  significant \nenvironmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. This \ncomponent  will  provide  specially  designed  training  programs \nand  biomass  development  assistance  to  the  poor  to  enable \nthem  to  adopt  integrated  agricultural  production  with  biomass \nsystems  for  cleaner  energy  production.  It  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration  model  for  government  agencies  (such  as  the \nPoverty  Alleviation  Office)  to  replicate  on  a  larger  scale  for \nfurther poverty reduction in other rural areas. \n\nand \n\nProject \n\nImplementation \n\nImprove \nCapacity \nDevelopment:  This  component  will  provide  consulting  services \nto strengthen technical support and coordination, and to improve \nthe  capability  of  the  implementing  agencies.

The  potential  global \nenvironmental benefits will be a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of \nabout 78,338 tons (t) per annum and over a million tons over the lifetime \nof  the  biomass-based  renewable  energy  systems.  Health  benefits  are \nexpected  to  result  from  cleaner  cooking  conditions  using  biogas  or \nproducer  gas.  The  need  to  collect  firewood  from  forests  will  be \neliminated,  thus  relieving  significant  pressure  on  forest  regeneration. \nThe  incomes  of  about  9,000  poor  farm  households  will  be  lifted  above \npoverty line. There will be substantial indirect and multiplier benefits for \nothers,  including  increased  employment  opportunities.  Annual  incomes \nfor  households  adopting  the  integrated  farming  biomass  systems  that \nincorporate biogas digesters are expected to increase by Y4,013 ($485) \nfor  traditional  farmers  moving  to  full  adoption  of  the  type  I  system. \nHouseholds  adopting  the  small-scale  farming  system  type  II  (3-in-1 \norchard  system)  will  achieve  a  higher  incremental  annual  income  of \nY14,254  ($1,722)  when  their  citrus  orchards  come  to  full  production  at \nabout Year 10. Financial returns from medium-scale biogas plants (type \nIII) are expected to be about 15.9 percent. Owners of gasification plants \n(type  IV)  should  achieve  returns  of  about  13.8  percent  on  their \ninvestment.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole  is  18.2  percent.  About  26  percent  of  the  beneficiaries  or  9,000 \nhouseholds will be from low-income groups. They will be provided with a \nspecial  support  to  make  it  possible  to  eliminate  the  socioeconomic \nbarriers  that  currently  prevent  them  from  adopting  integrated  biomass \nfarming systems. The Project will produce an annual incremental output \nof about 882 t of greenhouse vegetables, all organic; about 209,280 t of \ncitrus fruits; and 289,780 pigs. The Project will utilize over a million tons \nof agricultural wastes per year that would otherwise contaminate the soil \nand  river/water  systems,  and  provide  over  600,000  t  of  sludge  and \neffluent as farm organic fertilizer. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nix\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) of a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the Efficient \nUtilization of Agricultural Wastes Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nMoving into the new millennium, the Government of the PRC is facing the daunting task \nof  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  reversing  the  environmental  degradation  caused  by \ndecades  of  agricultural  intensification.  Increasing  rural  productivity  to  bring  about  both  food \nsecurity  and  poverty  reduction  in  rural  areas  is  a  critical  issue  for  the  PRC,  which  feeds  22 \npercent of the world\u2019s population on 7 percent of the world\u2019s arable land. Few opportunities exist \nin the country for expanding arable land. Increased farm productivity remains the key to meeting \nfuture  demand.  Associated  with  the  need  to  significantly  raise  farm  productivity  is  the  need  to \nreduce the rural-urban income gap through an intensive developmental effort to increase rural \nincomes, thereby reducing poverty, particularly in the interior provinces.  \n \n3. \nThe Government faces serious challenges in achieving high economic growth to reduce \npoverty  and  in  reversing  the  environmental  degradation  caused  by  rapid  industrialization  and \nagricultural intensification. Arable land in the PRC is actually diminishing, and new innovations \nare needed to bring about greater agricultural productivity to meet future demands. A number of \npoorer  and  mountainous  inland  provinces  with  limited  arable  land  are  promoting  the  use  of \ngreenhouses to intensify crop production and using biomass technologies to convert agricultural \nwaste to provide clean energy and organic fertilizers. In 1999, the Government requested ADB \nto fund its first Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project covering four inland provinces. \nA  feasibility  study  was  carried  out  in  July-December  2000  under  an  ADB  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).1  The  study  examined  resource  availability  and  the  technical  and \neconomical feasibility of converting agricultural wastes (such as household wastes, straw, and \nother crop and animal residues) into a clean source of energy for lighting, heating, and cooking \nthrough  integration  into  the  farmers\u2019  agricultural  production  system.  The  study  also  examined \nthe feasibility of reducing chemical fertilizer usage on farms, to be replaced by organic fertilizer \nderived from the effluent of the biogas digesters. This would help improve soil nutrients, reduce \ninput  costs,  and  increase  productivity.  Following  completion  of  project  preparation  and  the \nfeasibility  study  in  January  2001,  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  February  2001  to \nrefine  the  project  design  and  discuss  various  issues  with  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments  of  Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi.  The  Appraisal  Mission,  conducted  from \n25 May  to  16  June  2001,2  finalized  the  details  of  various  project  components.  The  linkages \namong the policies, institutional framework, goal, purpose, outputs, and physical investments of \nthe  Project  are  described  in  the  Project  Framework  (Appendix  1).  The  Project\u2019s  primary \nobjective is environmental protection. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   TA 3370-PRC: Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project, for $703,000, approved on 26 December 1999. \n2   The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  Y.L.

It provides an \nimportant  source  of  income  directly  or  indirectly  for  about  240  million  rural  families,  which \nconstitute about 64 percent of the country\u2019s total population. The sector accounted for about 15 \npercent  of  the  PRC\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in  2001.  About  95  million  hectares  (ha)  of  the \nPRC\u2019s land area of 960 million ha is cultivated. Until 1998, about half a million ha of arable land \nwas annually converted from agricultural to industrial, infrastructure, or housing use. With ADB \nassistance,  the  Government  amended  the  Land  Administration  Law  in  1998  to  protect  arable \nland  and  limit  conversion  to  other  uses  to  160,000  ha  per  year,  with  an  equivalent  amount  of \ndegraded  land  converted  to  agricultural  use.  The  pressure  on  land  has  resulted  in  farmers \nadopting  various  innovative  and  intensive  ways  of  increasing  farm  productivity  through  a \ncombination  of  intensive  labor,  chemicals,  small  machinery,  irrigation,  greenhouses,  and  other \nintensive  and  controlled  production  environments.  Intensive  farming  has  enabled  the  rural \nsector to meet the basic food requirements of the people, but the challenges ahead for further \nproductivity increases require innovative solutions. \n \n5. \nThe economic reform programs that started in the late 1970s provided a good model to \nenable  the  agriculture  sector  to  become  more  efficient  and  progressive.  The  most  important \naspect of the agriculture sector\u2019s reform program was the replacement of the commune system \nwith  a  household  contract  responsibility  system  wherein  plots  of  collectively  owned  land  were \nsubdivided  and  allocated  to  individual  households  for  farm  production.  Over  the  years,  this \nhousehold  responsibility  system  has  been  gradually  revised  and  is  now  moving  towards  a \nmarket-based  economy.  The  reforms  in  the  last  two  decades  have  resulted  in  an  increase  in \nagricultural  productivity  and  improved  terms  of  trade.  During  the  initial  years  of  reform, \nparticularly  in  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  agricultural  output  grew  at  about  8.8  percent  per \nannum. This growth slowed to about 3.8 percent a year in the early 1990s, but in recent years it \nhas increased to about 4.6 percent per annum, well in excess of the population growth of less \nthan 1 percent per annum.  \n \n6. \nWhile  the  reforms  in  the  rural  sector  have  resulted  in  significant  increased  output  and \nhigher  incomes,  the  disparity  between  urban  and  rural  income  has  grown.  The  early  years  of \nreform in the agriculture sector resulted in rural incomes increasing significantly, and the ratio of \nurban to rural incomes fell from 2.3 in 1980 to 1.7 in 1984. From the mid 1980s, however, the \nurban-rural  income  disparity  reversed  this  trend.  The  ratio  increased  to  2.9  in  2001,  when  the \naverage per capita urban income was Y6,860 compared with Y2,366 in rural areas.  \n \n7. \nRapid growth in per capita income has resulted in significant demand for meat products \nto  satisfy  the  needs  of  the  increasingly  affluent  urban  population.  This  has  resulted  in  rapid \nexpansion of livestock production, particularly of chickens and pigs. Total meat production in the \nPRC  increased  from  25  million  tons  in  1990  to  63  million  tons  in  2001  and  is  expected  to \nincrease  to  over  100  million  tons  by  2010  as  income  and  population  increase.  Livestock \nproduction has become an important component of rural farming systems. In 2000, there were \nabout  200,000  township  and  village  enterprises  (TVEs)  and  small  private  farms  involved  in \nlivestock  production.  The  number  of  medium-  to  large-scale  commercial  pig  farms  has \nincreased significantly from less than 5,000 in the 1970s to over 16,000 in 2000. The amount of \nwastewater discharged from each animal is about 20 liters per day. The effluent discharge from \n\n \n\n\f3\n\nthese  pig  farms  is  well  in  excess  of  a  billion  tons  a  year,  but  less  than  5  percent  was  being \ntreated.  Most  of  the  wastes  are  discharged  untreated  into  nearby  rivers,  lakes,  or  other  water \nbodies,  causing  serious  environmental  and  groundwater  pollution.  The  output  from  pig \nproduction is forecast to increase by about 8 percent per year, and pig wastes could increase to \nabout 5 billion tons a year by 2010. Reducing the potential for groundwater contamination and \nother environmental problems resulting from livestock sector expansion is a challenging task. In \nthe grain crops subsector, total grain production is expected to increase from about 407 million \ntons  in  1995  to  about  499  million  tons  by  2005,  or  a  23  percent  increase  in  a  decade.  This \nincrease in grain production will generate large quantities of straw, which is normally burned in \nthe field under current farming practices, leading to further environmental degradation such as \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) release and haze.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Environment Sector \n\n8. \nAs  a  consequence  of  rapid  economic  growth  since  the  late  1970s,  obsolete  industrial \ntechnology,  inappropriate  pricing,  and  a  lack  of  market-based  instruments  to  encourage \nenvironmentally friendly behavior, the PRC is now faced with serious environmental problems. \nSevere air and water pollution and land degradation affect crop production and human health. \nThe  economic  costs  of  environmental  pollution  were  estimated  to  be  about  Y98.6  billion  or \nabout 4 percent of gross domestic product in 1998.3 Air pollution accounted for about 59 percent \nof the total losses, with water pollution and solid waste accounting for the remaining 36 percent \nand  5  percent,  respectively.  The  PRC  relies  heavily  on  coal  as  its  primary  fuel  for  industrial \nproduction, power generation, and commercial and residential applications such as heating and \ncooking. The use of coal has resulted in the emission of high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and \ntotal  suspended  particulates  (TSP).  In  most  PRC  cities,  air  pollution  exceeds  environmental \nstandards  by  several  times.  The  high  level  of  air  pollution  in  densely  populated  cities  causes \nsevere health problems, particularly those related to respiratory illnesses.  \n \nThe  extensive  use  of  coal  has  adverse  ecological  and  human  health  impacts  on  the \n9. \nenvironment at all levels (globally, nationally, locally, and in the household). Global greenhouse \ngas  (GHG)  emissions  (measured  in  CO2  equivalent)  impact  on  the  rural  sector  and  in  severe \ncases  could  result  in  worsening  soil  erosion;  increasing  loss  of  fertile  soil  and  decreasing  soil \nhumidity;  rising  temperatures,  which  affect  plant  growth;  and  changes  in  precipitation  levels. \nThese impacts mean lower crop yields and increased crop losses. With fewer and lower quality \ncrops  and  livestock  to  sell  while  facing  continuing  declines  in  farm  productivity,  farm  incomes \nwill  decrease.  As  the  rural  agricultural  sector  is  the  keystone  of  the  national  economy, \naddressing GHG emissions is a fundamental issue for the economy. \n \nIn  addition  to  CO2  emissions  from  coal,  rural  agriculture  is  a  major  source  of  GHG \n10. \nemissions.4 These emissions include methane from the livestock sector and crop residues, and \nnitrogen oxide produced from fertilizers and field burning of crop residues. These emissions are \npredominantly  due  to  poor  farming  practices  and  inefficient  use  of  biomass  resources  (e.g., \nwood from forests, straw, organic wastes from animals and humans). About 100 million tons of \ncrop residues are burned in open fields every year. With the increase of agricultural production \nand  the  shift  from  traditional  to  commercial  energy  use  by  rural  consumers,  the  quantity  of \nunused  crop  residues  has  progressively  increased.

If  the  current  practices  continue \nunabated, GHG emissions will continue to increase. \n \n11. \nEconomic growth in the PRC will continue to be rapid for the foreseeable future. This will \nresult  in  further  expansion  of  energy  and  raw  material  usage.  Environment  quality  will  further \ndeteriorate  unless  production  technologies  and  management  standards  are  improved  and \nalternative cleaner energy sources such as renewable energy from biomass, wind, water, and \nsolar are promoted and increased throughout the country. \n \n12. \nSince the early 1990s, the Government has enacted a series of laws and regulations to \nstrengthen  environmental  management.  The  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration \n(SEPA)  and  other  government  agencies  were  strengthened  for  more  effective  monitoring  and \nimplementation of environmental regulations. The Government has created a conducive policy \nto  improve  environmental  management  involving  command-and-control  measures  requiring \nenterprises  to  adopt  appropriate  technologies  for  efficient  resource  use  and  reduced  pollution, \nand has provided economic incentives for environment-friendly production processes. Some of \nthe  command-and-control  measures  have  included  environment  impact  assessments  (EIAs), \nadoption  of  low-polluting  environmental  technologies,  centralized  waste  treatment,  adoption  of \ntechnologies  for  renewable  energy  generation,  and  treatment  of  agricultural  wastes.  Many \neconomic  incentive  policies  and  market-based  instruments  have  also  been  implemented, \nincluding adjusting prices to create incentives for conservation, a pollution levy system, taxes on \npolluting  inputs,  tax  rebates  for  environment-friendly  measures  adopted  by  enterprises,  and  a \nsystem of standards and permits for pollution monitoring and control.  \n \nIn  response  to  the  1992  Earth  Summit,  the  PRC  was  the  first  developing  country  to \n13. \nadopt an Agenda 21 Program to integrate economic and social development by improving the \nefficiency  of  energy  utilization,  introducing  environment-friendly  technologies,  and  managing \ntoxic and hazardous wastes. The Government is responding seriously to global environmental \nproblems  such  as  climate  change.  The  PRC  has  adopted  the  principles  of  \u201cprotection, \nconservation  and  rational  use  of  resources  and  giving  equal  importance  to  exploitation  and \nconservation\u2026  as  well  as  the  policy  that  whoever  exploits  the  resources  must  conserve, \nwhoever damages the resources must restore, whoever uses must compensate.\u201d5 In response \nto the PRC\u2019s programs to develop the economy and protect the environment, ADB provided TA \nto  develop  methodologies  to  (i)  evaluate  GHG  emissions  and  outline  options  for  policy \nimplementation,6  (ii)  evaluate  possible  options  for  more  efficient  capture  and  use  of  coalbed \nmethane gas,7  (iii) develop strategies to minimize SO2 emissions that cause acid rain,8 and (iv) \nparticipate  in  regional  activities  relating  to  global  warming  and  transboundary  environmental \ncooperation in Northeast Asia.9 \n \n14. \nThe  rapid  changes  in  household  energy  production,  poor  farming  practices,  and  the \nunderutilization  of  biomass  surpluses  exacerbate  the  problem  of  GHG  emissions.  Individually \nand  in  the  aggregate,  these  activities  contribute  to  air  pollution,  which  has  adverse \n                                                 \n5   Ministry of Agriculture, Agriculture Action Plan for China\u2019s Agenda 21, p. 41. \n6   TA 1690-PRC: National Response Strategy for Global Climate Change, for $600,000, approved on 10 April 1992. \n7   TA 3081-PRC: Coalbed Methane Demonstration Project, for $600,000, approved on 1 October 1998. \n8   TA  5528-REG:  Acid  Rain  and  Emissions  Reduction  in  Asia,  for  $450,000,  approved  on  16  April  1993;  and  TA \n5792-REG: Acid Rain and Emission Reduction in Asia, Phase II, for $600,000, approved on 3 September 1996. \n9   TA 5592-REG: A Study of a Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy for Asia, for $8,237,000, approved \non  4  August  1994;  with  supplementary  TAs  for  $492,000,  approved  on  10  September  1996,  and  for  $133,363, \napproved on 9 June 1998; TA 5695-REG: Environment Cooperation in Northeast Asia, for $495,000, approved on \n1  August  1996;  and  TA  5865-REG:  Transboundary  Environmental  Cooperation  in  Northeast  Asia,  for    $350,000, \napproved on 13 October 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5\n\nconsequences on the environment and human health. Forested lands are reduced as a result of \nbeing  used  as  a  source  of  firewood  and  from  clearing  for  new  development.  Current  farming \npractices, which include reliance on inorganic fertilizers, inappropriate fertilizer application, and \nuncontrolled  discharge  of  agricultural  wastes  into  rivers,  also  represent  a  serious  threat  to  the \nregional environment. \n \n\n3. \n\nRenewable Energy Development \n\nThe PRC is the second largest energy user in the world behind the United States. The \n15. \ndominant  source  of  energy  in  the  PRC  is  coal,  which  accounts  for  about  68  percent  of  total \ncommercial energy production, followed by oil (21 percent), hydropower (8 percent), and natural \ngas (3 percent). The PRC\u2019s total rural energy consumption in 2000 was about 600 million tons \nof  coal  equivalent,  with  crop  residue  (mainly  straw)  accounting  for  about  18  percent  and \nfirewood for 15 percent. As a result, deforestation is prevalent in some areas, contributing to soil \nerosion and flooding. The Government is addressing this problem by promoting efficient use of \nfuelwood, improving natural resource management, promoting afforestation, and providing rural \nhouseholds with access to electricity. Energy is a major source of GHG emissions, and the PRC \naccounts for about 10 percent of global GHG emissions from energy use. Its share will continue \nto grow as rapid rates of economic growth continue well into the next decade. \n \nRenewable  energy  is  an  important  component  of  the  PRC\u2019s  long-term  energy  strategy \n16. \nfor  rural  development.  The  country\u2019s  primary  energy  needs  are  still  dependent  on  coal,  even \nthough  the  use  of  oil  and  natural  gas  has  increased  in  recent  years.  Renewable  energy \ntechnologies  offer  an  environmentally  sound  source  of  energy,  especially  in  the  rural  and \nremote  areas.  The  PRC\u2019s  current  renewable  energy  resources  comprise  small-scale \nhydropower, wind, biomass, solar, and geothermal energy and are mostly used in rural areas. \nRenewable  energy  constitutes  a  major  element  of  the  PRC\u2019s  national  development  strategy. \nHowever,  compared  with  the  available  potential,  the  PRC\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  is \nrelatively small. By 2005, about 5 percent of the country\u2019s total energy consumption will come \nfrom renewable sources. Small-scale hydropower has been developed to commercial levels for \ndecentralized rural use and currently totals about 18 gigawatts. The installed capacity of wind-\nbased power generation is about 350 megawatts (MW), solar photovoltaic (PV) energy about 40 \nMW,  and  geothermal  energy  about  30  MW.  Biogas  power  systems  currently  account  for  only \nabout  100  MW  and  are  used  mainly  for  cooking,  lighting,  and  heating  by  individual  farm \nhouseholds. Biogas is mainly produced by small-scale individual farm households for their own \nuse.  In  the  case  of  large  pig  farms,  medium-scale  biogas  plants  are  constructed  to  produce \nbiogas  from  the  pig  manure,  and  the  biogas  is  connected  to  employees\u2019  houses  or  sold  to \nnearby  rural  households.  Biomass,  i.e.,  fuelwood  and  crop  residues,  accounts  for  nearly  a \nquarter of the country\u2019s energy supply, and about three quarters of energy consumed by rural \nhouseholds.  \n \n17. \nTo  reduce  continued  reliance  on  coal  as  a  source  of  energy,  particularly  in  the  rural \nareas, and to  address the  environmental problems associated with the energy sector, in 1995 \nthe Government launched an important measure and adopted the New and Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Program (1996-2010). This program aims at improving the efficiency of renewable \nenergy  technology  applications,  lowering  production  costs,  enlarging  the  contribution  of \nrenewable  energy  to  energy  supply,  and  deriving  environmental  benefits  by  reducing  air  and \nwater  pollution.  The  agriculture  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  addressing  GHG  emissions. \nThe  implementation  of  biomass-based  renewable  energy  technologies  by  rural  farms  and \nvillages will have a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\nThe PRC has significant experience in developing biomass technology. Productivity from \n18. \nbiomass digesters has increased by 50 percent during the last two decades. Since the 1960s, \nabout  7.5  million  biogas  generation  units  have  been  built  for  energy  production  in  the  rural \nareas.  However,  many  earlier  units  have  been  abandoned  due  to  factors  such  as  outdated \ntechnology  and  weak  technical  and  institutional  support.  The  major  lessons  learned  from  the \npast are the need  (i) to integrate biomass technology with existing farming systems to ensure \nviability,  (ii)  for  effective  service  infrastructure  and  competent  technicians  to  provide  operation \nand  maintenance  services,  (iii)  for  sufficient  concentration  of  biogas  units  in  one  location \ncovering  a  few  nearby  villages  to  ensure  sufficient  demand  for  service,  and  (iv)  to  ensure \neffective extension services and competent technicians to assist continued biomass technology \ndevelopment.  Since  the  mid  1990s,  special  emphasis  has  been  given  to  developing  efficient \nbiogas  digesters  integrated  into  the  existing  farming  systems  for  small  farm  households.  The \nintegration aims to combine environmental and economic benefits within a rural farming system \nto  provide  biogas  for  cooking,  heating,  and  lighting  for  farm  households  and  to  increase \nagriculture and livestock productivity. The development of biogas energy can use the availability \nof  large  amount  of  biomass  resources  in  the  rural  areas.  The  present  situation  of  biogas \ntechnology development in rural areas is optimum for development intervention because (i) the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  instituting  policies  and  measures  to  protect  the  deteriorating \nenvironment  in  both  the  urban  and  rural  areas;  (ii)  appropriate  biomass  technologies  have \nimproved significantly and are suitable for small farmers\u2019 adoption; (iii) provincial governments \nare  committed  to  promote  and  expand  biomass  technology  adoption  for  production  of  green \nvegetables;  (iv)  improved  service  infrastructure  makes  spare  parts  and  accessories  readily \navailable; and (v) small farmers are interested in adopting biomass technology to eliminate the \nuse  of  coal,  firewood,  and  straw  for  heating  and  cooking  and  to  produce  higher  quality  green \nvegetables.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAgriculture and Renewable Energy Development in the Project Provinces \n\nThe  middle  and  lower  reaches  of  the  Yellow  River  (Huanghe)  and  the  Yangtse  River \n19. \n(Changjiang)  basins  are  the  regions  where  the  PRC\u2019s  agricultural  civilization  started  5,000-\n7,000 years ago. The four project provinces\u2014Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shanxi\u2014 represent a \ntypical  sample  of  the  PRC\u2019s  oldest  farming  areas  (see  Map).  With  the  Huai  River  as  a \ndemarcation  (close  to  Latitude  32\u00b0),  Hubei  and  Jiangxi  provinces  are  located  in  the  southern \nsubtropical  zone,  while  Henan  and  Shanxi  belong  to  the  northern  temperate  zone.  In  the \nsouthern subtropical zone, agriculture is characterized by rice while the northern provinces are \ncharacterized by wheat production. These two crops constitute the staple food for the people in \nthe south and north, respectively, and in many aspects determine the patterns of local farming \nsystems and customs. Highlights of agriculture in each province are given in Appendix 2. \n \n20. \nThe  use  of  renewable  energy  technologies  offers  an  environmentally  sound  and  least-\ncost  option  to  replace  coal,  firewood,  and  straw  in  the  rural  and  remote  areas.  Pilot  programs \nencouraging  rural  households  to  adopt  biomass  technology  have  shown  highly  satisfactory \nresults.  Biogas  generation  from  small-scale  digesters  is  becoming  popular  in  the  four  project \nprovinces, and many villagers indicated their willingness to adopt the technologies. The project \nprovincial  governments  are  emphasizing  the  development  of  an  integrated  farming  system \nincorporating biomass technologies to generate cleaner biogas for lighting and cooking and for \norganic  fertilizer.  Local  governments  are  encouraging  rural  farm  households  to  build  biogas \ndigesters integrated into their farming systems to reduce the need to use firewood and coal, and \nthe  burning  of  straw  in  the  fields.  These  programs  should  improve  the  environment  and  raise \nfarmers\u2019 living conditions. Land used for biogas digester construction is normally exempted from \ntax. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7\n\n \n21. \nHubei  and  Jiangxi  have  pioneered  an  integrated  farming  system  with  biomass \ngeneration  called  the  3-in-1  model  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  A  for  details)  which \nincorporates pigs (or other livestock), digester, and an orchard (alternatively the orchard can be \nsubstituted  by  either  vegetables,  cotton,  fish  or  other  agriculture  crops).  This  biomass \ntechnology is well accepted among farmers. The provincial governments are promoting the use \nof  biomass  technology  to  help  improve  the  living  standards  of  the  farmers  and  to  improve  the \nenvironment.  \n \n22. \nIn  Henan  and  Shanxi,  biomass  technology  development  has  also  progressed  steadily. \nThe  4-in-1  model  based  on  integration  of  biogas  digester,  greenhouse,  vegetables,  and  pig \nproduction was developed under the Government\u2019s promotion program. To eliminate the need \nto burn wheat straw in the field, the Government is also actively promoting the construction of \nbiomass gasification plants utilizing straw for generating producer gas for cooking and lighting.  \n \n\n5. \n\nBarriers to the Expansion of Biomass Renewable Energy  \n\n23. \nThe promotion and expansion of biomass technologies in rural areas face many barriers \nand constraints. The project provincial governments lack the technical and financial resources to \nrapidly  expand  their  biomass  renewable  energy  programs.  Most  rural  households  have  no \nmeans to finance the investment. With the availability of relatively cheap supplies of coal (which \ncauses  serious  environmental  degradation  and  health  problems),  the  use  of  firewood  (which \ncauses  destruction  of  forested  areas),  and  no  alternate  means  to  utilize  crop  residues  and \nanimal  wastes,  farm  households  would  continue  to  heat  and  cook  as  they  presently  do  and \ncontinue  to  burn  crop  residues  in  open  fields.  Consequently,  GHG  emissions  from  coal, \nfirewood, animal wastes, and crop residue burning would continue. It is therefore important that \nthe  barriers  to  the  promotion  and  rapid  adoption  of  biomass  energy  systems  be  identified  and \nremoved.  The  proposed  Project  aims  to  identify  those  barriers  and  provide  the  means  and \nresources  to  remove  them  and  to  develop  sustainable  and  replicable  models  for  further \nexpansion to other provinces.  \n \n24. \nin the four project provinces are as follows: \n \n\nThe key barriers that restrict the promotion and expansion of biomass renewable energy \n\n(i) \n\nLack of a replicable financing model and shortage of available capital and \ncredit in rural areas. The expansion of biomass renewable energy is restricted \nbecause  there  is  no  sustainable  and  replicable  financing  model.  Longer  term \ncredit facilities are not available to rural households for the adoption of biomass-\nbased  renewable  energy  systems.  The  rural  commercial  banks  such  as  the \nAgricultural  Bank  of  China,  rural  credit  cooperatives,  and  other  financial \ninstitutions  are  uncertain  about  the  viability  of  biogas  technology  and  do  not \nprovide  longer  term  financing  to  small  farmers.  In  addition,  the  relatively  low \nincomes  of  small  farmers  make  it  impossible  for  them  to  obtain  credit  from \ncommercial  sources.  Medium-scale  biomass  systems,  such  as  gasifiers,  have \nlow  operating  and  maintenance  costs  compared  with  conventional  alternatives, \nbut these systems have high front-end costs. This poses a barrier to prospective \ninvestors such as village organizations, TVEs, or entrepreneurs, who do not have \neither  collateral  or  access  to  long-term  financing.  The  overall  weak  financial \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8\n\nsituation of the communities makes it difficult for them to obtain commercial loans \noffered by rural financial institutions.10 \n\n(ii)  Weak institutional capacities, inadequate technical expertise, and a lack of \nviable service infrastructure along with incentives for continued operation. \nThe  qualified  technical  staff  needed  to  promote  and  support  biomass  energy \nexpansion are in short supply. There are inadequate numbers of biomass energy \nsystem  designers,  contractors,  maintenance  technicians,  and  extension  staff  to \nrapidly  promote  and  expand  the  use  of  biomass  technologies.  This  inhibits  the \nexpansion of biomass systems. Access to the modern technologies and technical \nlinks  are  not  readily  available,  inhibiting  the  ability  to  incorporate  advanced \ntechnologies  such  as  in  biomass  gasification  plants.  High  project  preparation \ncosts  restrict  expansion,  because  investors  are  reluctant  to  proceed  with  these \nactivities without the assurance of financing. Technical support is required to help \npotential investors to prepare feasibility studies, designs, and cost estimates, and \nto  develop  business  plans  in  order  to  secure  financing.  To  ensure  sustainable \noperation  of  individual  biogas  units,  biogas  plants,  and  biomass  gasification \nplants, a viable and effective private service sector must be developed to provide \nspare  parts,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  services  and  to  help  improve \ntechnology  as  new \nIncentives  such  as \ntechniques  become  available. \nconcentration of a minimum number of biogas units in one location to support a \nservice  agency  unit  must  be  ensured,  along  with  government  policy  to  provide \nincentives for service personnel to earn an adequate income for the provision of \nsuch services. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nInadequate and poor rural infrastructure for effective biomass technology. \nPoor access to remote villages in rural areas hampers the efficient extension of \ntechnical services and the availability of spare parts and accessories for effective \nO&M of biogas digesters. It also causes higher damage to farm produce during \ntransportation, particularly during the wet season. Overcoming this barrier in rural \nareas  will  result  in  quicker  and  frequent  access  by  technical  staff  to  expand \nbiomass  technology  as  well  as  to  reduce  farm  produce  damage  during \ntransportation.  This  will  result  in  higher  farm  incomes  for  better  O&M  of  biogas \ndigesters. \n\nLack of sound environmental programs for developing a reliable database \nand social monitoring, and lack of public awareness and information. At the \nprovincial  level,  there  is  a  need  for  assistance  to  develop  environmental \nprograms and to assist in their implementation. Environmental monitoring at the \ncounty level is poor due to inadequate equipment and personnel. The generation \ninformation  could  provide  a  good \nof  quality  environmental  data  and \ndemonstration  effect  to  convince  local  governments  to  develop  appropriate \nenvironmental  policies  and  protection  measures.  Local  government  officials,  in \nparticular  the  decision  makers  from  the  planning  commissions,  finance  and \nagricultural bureaus, as well as farmers and potential investors, lack information \nabout the implications and use of biomass energy systems. Consequently, they \nare  unable  to  make  practical  decisions  on  an  investment.  They  also  lack \n\n                                                 \n10  For a review of the financing system for rural energy development, see TA 2100-PRC: Rural Energy Development \n\nStudy, for $500,000, approved on 16 June 1994.  \n\n \n\n\f9\n\n(v) \n\nknowledge of the overall environmental and human health concerns and possible \nbenefits that are directly related to biomass energy systems.  \n\nin  biomass \n\nto  participate \n\nLack of confidence for Government to provide adequate assistance to the \npoor, resulting in the inability of a large number of disadvantaged and poor \nhouseholds \ntechnology  development. \nDisadvantaged  and  poor  households  have  been  unable  to  participate  in \nrenewable energy program, even though they are important partners to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s overall environmental objectives, as well as to improve the quality \nof  their  lives.  Millions  of  poor  farmers  are  in  need  of  assistance.  Poorer \nhouseholds have very special and extraordinary problems that inhibit them from \nparticipating  in  income-generating  projects.  Major  constraints  include  lack  of \ncapital,  weak  technical  capability,  and  lack  of  education  and  training.  Special \nassistance  is  needed  to  help  this  group  of  disadvantaged  and  poor  farmers  to \nadopt  biomass  technology.  The  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  help  the  poor  are \nconstrained by lack of an appropriate approach to enable a large number of the \npoor  to  participate  in  biomass  technology  development.  Without  an  appropriate \nbiomass technology development approach or model, the Government lacks the \nconfidence \nthe \ndisadvantaged  and  poor  rural  households  to  participate  in  biomass  technology \ndevelopment. \n\nlarger  scale  assistance \n\nto  commit \n\nto  enable \n\nitself \n\nfor \n\n(vi)  Weak implementation and management capacity. Implementation agencies at \nlocal  levels  are  weak  and  lack  experience  in  implementing  large-scale  biomass \ntechnology  projects.  They  require  technical  support  to  further  strengthen  their \ninstitutional capability and coordination functions. \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n1. \n\nAgriculture \n\n25. \nThe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (TFP)  (2001-2005)  was  approved  by  the  National  People's \nCongress on 15 March 2001. Under the TFP, efforts will be intensified to bring about stronger \neconomic restructuring, sustain natural resources management, and preserve the environment. \nThe  TFP  gives  high  priority  to  the  agriculture  sector  in  order  to  maintain  the  momentum \nachieved  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan.  The  Western  Region  Development  Strategy  gives  high \npriority to the development of western and central provinces and to reducing poverty in the less \naccessible areas. The medium-term sector strategies are designed to increase food production \nand  increase  rural  incomes  and  employment  opportunities  to  reduce  the  widening  rural-urban \nincome  disparities.  Given  the  arable  land  constraints  (currently  at  0.1  ha  per  capita),  the \nagriculture  sector  development  strategy  focuses  on  increasing  farm  productivity,  developing \nunderutilized and waste land, diversifying crop production, and adopting integrated approaches \nto farming that are friendly to the environment. The strategy also seeks to increase value added \nfor  agricultural  produce  and  to  increase  off-farm  employment  opportunities.  The  TFP \nemphasizes  adopting  an  integrated  system  of  farming  with  biomass  technology  to  generate \nbiogas and other renewable energy to improve the environment.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction  \n\n26. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  poverty  reduction.  The  PRC  is  one  of  the  successful \ncountries in reducing rural poverty. The number of people classified as absolutely poor declined \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\nland,  and \n\nfrom 125 million in 1985 to 32 million in 2000.11 This success is based on broad-based pro-poor \neconomic growth, investment in social and physical infrastructure development, and promotion \nof good governance and policies to include the poor in mainstream development. Despite this \nremarkable success, the PRC still accounts for around one fourth of the absolute poor in Asia. \nThe  majority  of  the  rural  poor  live  in  the  central  and  western  provinces,  mostly  in  areas  with \nlimited  natural  resources,  poor  agricultural \ninadequate  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure. About 60 percent of the poor live in mountainous areas characterized by poor soil \nconditions and in areas suffering from drought and environmental degradation.  \n \n27. \nThe PRC\u2019s poverty reduction-related objectives, as expressed in the TFP and the Ten-\nYear Poverty Reduction Strategy, call for significant effort to increase the incomes of farmers; \nprovide  physical  infrastructure;  develop  industries  for  processing,  storing,  and  transporting \nagricultural products; create off-farm employment opportunities for the rural poor; and increase \nstandards  of  living  for  the  urban  and  rural  poor  in  terms  of  housing,  education,  health,  and \nenvironment.  The  Government  is  also  promoting  labor-intensive  industries,  especially  in  the \nservice  sector,  to  increase  job  opportunities,  and  is  offering  incentives  for  people  to  start  their \nown businesses.  \n \n28. \nSince  1986,  the  State  Council\u2019s  Leading  Group  for  Poverty  has  launched  a  number  of \npoverty reduction programs. These previous programs are periodically revised to better respond \nto the challenges of poverty reduction. The previous poverty reduction program focused on 592 \npoverty counties across the nation. In June 2001, the new poverty reduction program for 2001 \nto 2010 was launched. The new program promotes decentralized implementation and bottom-\nup participatory needs assessment of the poor at the village level to develop a specific poverty \nreduction strategy for each area. \n \n29. \nThe  strong  government  commitment  to  reduce  poverty  is  witnessed  by  the  increased \nallocation  of  budgetary  funds  for  poverty  reduction.  Since  1994,  real  annual  Government \nspending on poverty reduction has increased by 260 percent. In 2002, the budgeted funds for \nthe  poverty  reduction  program  totaled  Y26  billion  ($3.1  billion).  In  this  new  program,  the \nGovernment is committed to increasing the budget by Y1 billion-Y5 billion to a total of Y5 billion \n($121 million to $605 million) annually. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnergy  \n\n30. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  in  the  energy  sector  is  to  reduce  the  growth  of  coal \nconsumption  and  the  environmental  pollution  that  coal  consumption  causes.  The  Government \nhas  recognized  the  need  to  address  the  environmental  problems  associated  with  the  heavy \ndependence of coal, and has reiterated its commitment to increase the use of renewable energy \nas outlined in its Program on New and Renewable Energy Development (1996-2010). The plan \ncalls  for  promoting  clean  coal  technologies  for  energy  production  and,  where  possible, \nsubstituting  the  use  of  coal  energy  with  natural  gas,  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass \nrenewable  energy.  Concerted  efforts  are  being  made  to  improve  energy  management  and  to \ndecrease the growth rate of energy consumption. The Government aims to develop renewable \nenergy  to  (i)  diversify  power  generation,  (ii)  accelerate  rural  development,  (iii)  develop \nsustainable resources, and (iv) derive environmental benefits.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  These figures are based on the PRC\u2019s Chinese poverty line, which is about $0.66 per capita expenditure a day on \n\na purchasing power parity basis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11\n\nIn the TFP, the Government will accelerate renewable energy development through the \n31. \nuse  of  market-based  policy  instruments.  The  Government  will  create  a  market  for  renewable \nenergy through a mandated market share policy. The key elements of the new policy are to (i) \ncreate  a  mandated  market  share  for  renewable  energy  in  the  form  of  a  legal  requirement  that \nsome  share  of  electricity  comes  from  renewable  energy,  and  (ii)  introduce  an  instrument  to \nshare  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  among  the  regions  in  the  PRC.  The  Government \nintends to gradually introduce a requirement that 5 percent of electricity supplied to consumers \nbe generated from renewable energy sources. To support the development and implementation \nof the new renewable energy policy and to catalyze international financing, the Government has \nalso  initiated  the  development  of  the  Partnership  for  Renewable  Energy  with  support  from  the \nWorld  Bank  and  GEF.  The  Partnership  will  provide  an  umbrella  for  all  renewable  energy \nactivities within the country during the next decade. It will support the Government\u2019s Renewable \nEnergy Program during the Tenth and Eleventh Five-Year Plans to create a mandated market \nand reduce costs for mature technologies such as wind farm, small hydroelectric, and biomass. \nMaintaining the current share of 5 percent renewable energy in power generation is being taken \nas the tentative goal for the purpose of preparation of the Government\u2019s Program. In May 2001, \na  World  Bank  mission  visited  the  PRC  to  prepare  the  World  Bank/GEF  China  Renewable \nEnergy Scale-up Program (CRESP). The GEF Council approved the CRESP Project Brief at its \nMay  2001  meeting  and  is  supporting  it  with  a  grant  of  $140  million.  Under  the  CRESP,  the \nWorld Bank will provide assistance to recommend revisions to current pricing policies that are \nconsistent  with  the  PRC  market  economy  and  international  best  practice,  as  part  of  CRESP \npreparation.  \n    \n\n4. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n32. \nIn  the  environment  sector,  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  objectives  are  to  (i)  control \nenvironmental  pollution;  (ii)  improve  the  quality  of  the  environment,  particularly  in  major  cities; \n(iii) reduce degradation of natural ecological systems; and (iv) integrate environmental planning \nwith  social  and  economic  development.  The  major  emphasis  will  be  given  to  reducing  air  and \nwater pollution in 52 major cities where it is most severe. The Government will pursue a strategy \nof  sustainable  development,  integrating  environmental  protection  programs  into  national \neconomic and social planning, and establishing an effective environmental regulatory framework \nand management systems in urban and rural areas. \n \n33. \nIn  the  TFP,  the  Government  will  continue  to  improve  ecological  conservation  and \nstrengthen environmental protection. To this end, it will continue to implement new natural forest \nprotection  projects  on  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  and  in  the  upper  and  middle \nreaches  of  the  Yellow  River;  control  urban  pollution  by  strengthening  enforcement  and \nintroducing new and comprehensive regulatory measures to improve the environmental quality \nof large and medium-sized cities; protect the rural environment, especially from pollution caused \nby  farm  chemicals;  and  improve  environmental,  meteorological,  and  seismological  monitoring \nsystems to help prevent and reduce natural disasters. \n \nC. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n34. \nThe World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are the major \nsources  of  external  assistance  to  the  PRC.  JBIC  has  provided  over  $20  billion  to  the  country, \nmainly for infrastructure and environmental development. As of 30 June 2000, the World Bank \nhad financed about 234 projects with loans totaling about $35 billion. Of these, 61 projects with \nloans  totaling  $9.7  billion  supported  agricultural  development,  31  projects  with  loans  of  $6.3 \nbillion were for energy sector development, and 17 projects with loans totaling $2.4 billion were \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\nthe \n\nthrough \n\ninvestment  programs \n\nto help improve the environment. The World Bank is assisting the Government in formulating a \nPartnership  with  GEF  to  provide  the  Government  with  about  $100  million  in  loans  through  its \nCRESP. In the development of renewable energy resources in the PRC, the World Bank\u2019s $100 \nmillion  renewable  energy  development  project  includes  a  wind  farm  component,  a  solar  PV \ncomponent, and a technology improvement component.  \n \n35. \nADB is another major international lender to the PRC. As of December 2000, the country \nhad  received  a  total  of  83  loans  amounting  to  $10.3  billion  from  ADB.  In  the  agriculture  and \nnatural resources sector, ADB has provided 9 loans amounting to $583.9 million. In the energy \nsector,  15  loans  amounting  to  $1.8  billion  were  provided.  A  Wind  Power  Development  Project \nloan of $58 million was provided in November 2000 to assist the PRC in developing renewable \nenergy.  A  Renewable  Energy  Development  TA  addressed  barriers  to  the  commercial \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  through  reviewing  the  policy  and  institutional  framework, \ndeveloping  and  evaluating  prioritized \nfor  commercialization,  and \nidentifying specific investment requirements for external financing.12 \n \nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and GEF have also contributed to \n36. \nthe PRC\u2019s renewable energy development. GEF has financed two projects in Yunnan Province: \n(i) the Energy Conservation Project\u2014a $22 million GEF grant, together with a World Bank loan \nof  $63  million  and  a  European  Commission  grant  of  $5  million,  aims  to  increase  energy \nintroduction,  demonstration,  and  dissemination  of  new  energy \nefficiency \nconservation project financing concepts and market-oriented institutions; and (ii) the $35 million \nRenewable Energy Project aims to develop and enhance the renewable energy sector. A World \nBank  loan  of  $100  million  was  provided  to  support  the  grid-connected  wind  component.  The \nWind Power Development Project13 aims to reduce GHG emissions by accelerating the growth \nof \nfuel \nconsumption in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Xinjiang. The Capacity Building for \nthe Rapid Commercialization of Renewable Energy in the PRC Project is another GEF project \nthat  aims  to  primarily  address  commercialized  large-scale  renewable  energy  technologies \nthrough  market-based  instruments.  Direct  beneficiaries  of  this  project  will  be  professionals, \npolicy  makers,  and  businessmen  who  will  be  exposed  to  market-friendly  mechanisms  for  the \ncommercialization  of  renewable  energy  forms.  The  Issues  and  Options  in  Greenhouse  Gas \nEmissions  Control  Project  had  its  goals  to  generate  information  needed  by  policymakers  for \nmaking good decisions on reducing GHG emissions, introduce efficient industrial boiler designs \nand controls, reduce residential and commercial coal use, and train various professionals in the \nskills  needed  to  attain  the  previous  three  goals.  The  project  took  place  from  January  1992 \nthrough March 1994. The CRESP (para. 31) will support the implementation of a national policy \nframework  that  will  legally  require  a  share  of  electricity  to  be  met  from  renewable  energy \nresources.  \n \nUNDP has a number of ongoing and pipeline programs to support the commercialization \n37. \nof  renewable  energy.  These  include  (i)  the  ongoing  Resources  Concessions  for  Sustainable \nDevelopment  of  Renewable  Energy  Project,  focusing  on  policy  implementation  with  respect  to \nwind  energy;  (ii)  a  pipeline  project  that  aims  to  develop  a  National  Energy  Strategy  and  Plan; \nidentify  energy-related  issues/strategies,  and  set  options  for  energy  policy  development;  (iii)  a \nproposed demonstration project to promote modernized biomass energy in Jilin Province; (iv) a \nproject  to  help  strengthen  the  Chengdu  Biogas  Research  and  Training  Center;  and  (v)  the \nongoing Capacity Building for the Rapid Commercialization of Renewable Energy Project.  \n\nlarge-scale  grid-connected  wind  power  development \n\nto  replace  current \n\nfossil \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12  TA 3056-PRC: Renewable Energy Development Project, for $566,000, approved on 19 August 1998. \n13  Project Number CPR/00/G31. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13\n\n \n38. \nBilateral assistance agencies are focusing on installing PV systems and developing grid-\nconnected  wind  farms.  Denmark,  Germany,  and  Spain  are  the  main  bilateral  sources  of \nassistance  for  wind-based  renewable  energy  development.  There  is  an  ongoing  cooperation \nproject in Liaoning Province financed by Italy dealing with gasification technology. A protocol on \nScientific  and  Technological  Cooperation  was  signed  in  June  2000  covering  scientific  and \ntechnological  activities  that  provide  support  for  the  exchange  of  PRC  and  Italian  researchers. \nThe Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom recently financed \nRural  Energy  in  China\u2013A  Scoping  Study  but  has  not  made  any  commitment  in  the  renewable \nenergy  sector  for  the  next  few  years.  DFID\u2019s  emphasis  is  mainly  on  poverty  reduction, \nconcentrating on provinces of Ganzu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces.  \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n39. \nSince the PRC joined ADB in 1986, a number of projects in the agriculture, energy, and \nenvironment  sectors  have  been  implemented  and  completed.  Similarly,  the  World  Bank  and \nother funding agencies have also completed many projects related to the proposed Project, and \nvaluable lessons have been learned. Most of these projects have addressed issues relating to \npromoting  agricultural  reform,  liberalizing  markets,  raising  the  level  of  crop  production, \nincreasing farm productivity, generating rural employment, reducing the rural-urban income gap \nand poverty, developing renewable energy, and protecting the environment. The assessment of \nADB\u2019s Country Assistance Program in the PRC, conducted in 1998,14 noted that the country has \na  strong  capacity  for  project  implementation,  with  most  ADB-assisted  projects  implemented \nefficiently and some completed ahead of schedule. There is a strong sense of project ownership \nat all levels and consequent commitment to their effective implementation. Factors contributing \nto  many  project  successes  included  (i)  intensive  project  preparatory  phase  and  rigorous \nscreening  to  ensure  appropriate  technical,  financial,  and  economic  viability  as  well  as  debt \nservicing  capability;  (ii)  strong  commitment  and  technical  capability  of  executing  agencies;  (iii) \nappropriate  project  activity  sequencing  and  suitable  institutional  arrangements  for  effective \nimplementation;  (iv)  strong  involvement  of  beneficiaries  (individual  households  or  village \ncommunity  groups)  during  project  preparation;  (v)  effective  interagency  coordination;  and  (vi) \nstrong  performance  monitoring.  Another  lesson  learned  is  that  project  performance  tends  to \nimprove  when  TA  is  provided  to  upgrade  the  capabilities  of  executing  agencies  and  to  hold \nseminars  and  workshops  to  familiarize  project  staff  with  ADB  procurement  and  disbursement \nprocedures as well as other project implementation and monitoring guidelines at the early stage \nof project implementation. \n \n40. \nHowever,  not  all  ADB-funded  projects  have  been  successfully  implemented.  There  are \nareas  of  weaknesses  that  need  to  be  highlighted.  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  agriculture  sector \nover  the  period  1986-1999  revealed  some  poor  performances.  Less  than  satisfactory \nperformance  was  noted  in  the  Hexian  Pulp  Mill  Project  (Loan  937-PRC),  involving  an  inward-\nlooking  state-owned  entity  that  isolated  itself  in  a  rapidly  changing  sector  that  is  increasingly \nexposed  to  international  competition.  Projects  that  promoted  direct  government  investment  to \nprovide incentives and regulatory functions and involving extensive individual private household \nand community participation in production, harvesting, and downstream processing were more \nsuccessful. These lessons have been considered and incorporated in the design of subsequent \nprojects, including the proposed Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  CAP: PRC 98026: Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the People\u2019s Republic of China, January 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\nin \n\nto \n\nlearned \n\nlessons \n\nin  design.  The \n\nthe  proposed  Project \n\nSeveral  World  Bank  postcompletion  reviews  of  agriculture  projects  have  also  been \n41. \ndrawn upon for lessons learned to be applied in the project design. The projects reviewed are \nmulticomponent  ones  implemented  in  many  counties  and  in  more  than  one  province,  and  are \ntherefore  similar \nthese \nmulticomponent and multilocation projects include the need for: (i) flexibility in project design to \nrespond  to  site-specific  technical  problems  and  rapid  market  changes,  and  (ii)  specific \nmeasures to ensure poverty reduction impacts by providing increased extension and support to \nfarmers.  The  project  design  has  accordingly  incorporated  these  lessons  and  experience. \nVarious  measures  are  being  taken  to  allow  for  project  activities  to  be  implemented  in  the  four \nprovinces in a flexible manner; to provide extensive technical training, extension, and support to \nsmall farmers to enable them to increase productivity and income; and to effect improvement in \nthe environment. \n \n42. \nIn the energy and environment sectors, the Country Assistance Program Evaluation for \nthe PRC (para. 39) concluded that ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in these sectors are appropriate. \nADB has played an effective role in assisting the PRC in the environment sector and has made \nadvances  in  expanding  its  policies  on  social  concerns.  The  loan  projects  addressing \nenvironmental problems in several major cities have been generally successful. \n \nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy \n\n43. \nIn  pursuit  of  ADB\u2019s  overarching  poverty  reduction  objective,  the  current  PRC  Country \nOperational Strategy15 was designed to (i) assist in improving the efficiency of the economy in a \nsustainable  manner,  (ii)  help  address  poverty  by  promoting  growth  in  the  poorer  interior \nprovinces,  and  (iii)  achieve  balanced  regional  development  to  protect  the  environment  and \nbetter  manage  the  country\u2019s  natural  resources.  The  poverty  reduction  objectives  of  ADB,  as \nexpressed  in  its  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  include  three  pillars:  (i)  pro-poor,  sustainable \neconomic growth, in which growth is based on policies and programs that facilitate employment \nand income generation for the poor; (ii) social development that can enable the poor to make full \nuse  of  the  opportunities  to  improve  their  living  standard  (poverty  interventions),  and  programs \ndirectly  addressing  the  severity  of  poverty  (core-poverty  interventions);  and  (iii)  good \ngovernance,  to  ensure  that  the  poor  have  better  access  to  basic  services  and  a  greater  voice \nand participation in decisions affecting them. \n \n44. \nFor  agriculture,  the  country  operational  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  increasing  efficiency  in \nagricultural  production,  processing,  and  marketing;  (ii)  reducing  rural  poverty  and  increasing \nrural  income  opportunities  through  cash  crops  and  off-farm  employment;  (iii)  improving \nmanagement  and  development  of  soil,  water,  forest,  and  marine  resources  for  sustainable \ndevelopment; (iv) supporting the transition to a market economy through improved incentives for \nprivate sector investment and establishment of a market information system; and (v) supporting \nenterprise reforms. ADB\u2019s operations are designed to narrow the gap between rural and urban \nincome  opportunities  by  assisting  in  land  reform,  improving  agricultural  production  and \nproductivity,  providing  better  postharvest  processing  facilities,  developing  efficient  markets  for \nagricultural goods, intensifying extension and research, and conserving the environment. ADB\u2019s \nstrategic  thrust  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  poorer  inland  provinces  is  to  help  (i)  promote  market-\nbased  policy  changes  to  attract  more  foreign  and  domestic  investments;  (ii)  address  rural \ninfrastructure  and  institutional  constraints;  (iii)  develop  integrated  agriculture  and  agro-based \nindustries; (iv) develop transportation, communications, and marketing linkages between interior \n\n                                                 \n15  STS: PRC 95021: Country Operational Strategy Study, People\u2019s Republic of China, May 1997.

Agricultural  projects  are \ndesigned to simultaneously address both the environmental concerns and crosscutting issues, \nparticularly poverty reduction, beneficiary welfare, and natural resources management.  \n \nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue   \n\n1. \n\nLand Tenure Reforms \n\n46. \nLand  use  and  land  tenure  in  the  project  provinces  are  covered  by  the  respective \nprovincial  regulations  within  the  broad  policy  framework  of  the  national  government.  ADB \nassisted the PRC in drafting the Land Administration Law, which became effective on 1 January \n1999. The law provides for a national land-use plan that will stipulate the total amount of arable \nland to be put under protection. Every province, county, and township will be assigned a quota \nof  arable  land  for  protection.  The  area  of  cultivated  land  should  comprise  80  percent  of  the \narable land. Any arable land that is required for urban or industrial expansion must be replaced \nby  a  similar  area  of  unused  degraded  land  (such  as  wetlands,  hilly  areas  or  other  marginal \nlands)  that  should  be  reclaimed  to  become  arable  land.  The  local  governments  must  develop \nplans  to  protect  arable  land.  A  national  supervision  and  inspection  system  for  land  resources \nand  land  occupation  has  been  set  up  at  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Land  Administration  Law.  To  help  modify  provincial  land  administration \nlaws  to  be  consistent  with  the  1998  amendments  to  the  national  law,  ADB  helped  Sichuan \nProvince draft a model enabling provincial law, which could be adopted by other provinces. The \nSichuan land law provides that: (i) there is registration of land rights and issuance of certificates \nby  which  landholders  can  confirm  their  rights  against  intrusions  by  other  landholders  and \nclaimants,  and  against  arbitrary  actions  by  state  or  local  government  agencies;  (ii)  local \ngovernments are given the responsibility for preparing the overall land use plans; (iii) formulas \nfor  payments  for  rural  land  to  be  acquired  for  urban  construction  or  other  purposes  should  be \nbased  on  the  measurement  of  the  productivity  of  the  rural  land  being  acquired,  and  on  full \ncompensation  for  collective  farm  organizations  and  individual  families;  and  (iv)  citizens \nparticipate in the process of land use and planning and in the procedures for conversion of rural \nland to urban uses. Representatives from the four project provinces attended a workshop that \nreviewed  the  model  Sichuan  law.  ADB  also  funded  a  Land  Use  and  Land  Use  Tenure  Policy \nStudy in Fujian Province.16 \n \n47. \nAccess  to  adequate  land  resources  by  rural  farmers  is  an  important  factor  in  rural \npoverty  reduction.  Reform  of  the  legal  framework  covering  land  use  and  land  tenure  is  a  vital \nstep  in  reducing  rural  poverty.  During  project  processing,  policy  dialogue  with  the  project \n\n                                                 \n16  TA  2408-PRC:  Land  Use  and  Land  Tenure  Policy  in  Fujian  Province,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  28  September \n\n1995. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\nto  highlight \n\nthe \nprovinces  was  undertaken \nrecommendations of the ADB-assisted Sichuan Province report were discussed. The Appraisal \nMission  urged  the  respective  provincial  governments  to  consider  the  study  and  adopt  the \nrecommendations.  \n \n\nimportance  of \n\ntenure,  and \n\nland  use \n\nthe \n\n2. \n\nPromotion of Biogas Energy Development and Barrier Removal \n\n48. \nThe  Government  initiated  the  promotion  of  biogas  energy  development  under  the \nframework  of  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (1986-1990),  which  established  energy  quality \nstandards,  standardized  energy  technologies,  and  strengthened  institutional  capacity  in  the \ndevelopment of biogas from agricultural wastes. The early experience led to the implementation \nof  an  Integrated  Rural  Energy  Development  Program  (IREDP).  IREDP  demonstrated  the \nfeasibility of renewable energy technologies such as biogas digesters and biomass gasification \nplants using low-cost agricultural wastes.  \n \n49. \nBecause  of  its  potential  to  improve  the  environment  through  reduction  in  coal  usage, \nincreased  utilization  of  agricultural  wastes  for  biogas  production,  and  organic  fertilizer \nproduction, ADB and other international agencies have actively engaged in policy dialogue with \nthe Government to promote biogas renewable energy development. In 1996, ADB financed the \nRural Energy Development Study,17 following which ADB engaged in active discussion with the \nGovernment  that  resulted  in  the  preparation  of  the  Efficient  Utilization  of  Agricultural  Wastes \nfeasibility  study.18  Policy  dialogue  undertaken  during  the  current  project  processing  aimed  at \npromoting larger scale biogas energy development in the PRC. However, impediments exist for \nthe development of biomass renewable energy in the rural sector.  These barriers are inhibiting \nrapid adoption of biomass technologies (para. 24).  \n \n50. \nDuring the TFP, the Government will introduce policies and mechanisms to promote the \nadoption of biomass technologies, and the plan aims to achieve a target of 300,000 households \nper  year.  The  World  Bank  and  GEF  will  assist  the  Government  through  the  Partnership  for \nRenewable  Energy  Development  to  develop  policies  and  mechanisms  for  renewable  energy \ndevelopment. The World Bank-GEF assistance for the partnership will not likely be operational \nin  the  near  future,  and  several  more  years  will  probably  be  required  before  an  appropriate \nregulatory  and  policy  framework  is  established  for  renewable  energy  development.  In  the \nmeantime,  the  Government  will  actively  pursue  the  TFP  target  of  300,000  rural  households \nadopting  biomass  technologies.  The  Project  will  support  the  partnership  by  providing \nmomentum  for  the  adoption  of  biomass  energy  systems  in  rural  areas  during  the  transition \nperiod. \n \n51. \nThe barriers inhibiting biomass renewable energy development will be addressed in the \nproject provinces. As a result of the Mission\u2019s policy dialogue, a viable and sustainable financing \nmodality  will  be  developed  so  that  rural  households  can  have  access  to  longer  term  credit. \nSteps  will  also  be  taken  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity  and  to  overcome  shortages  of \ntechnical  expertise.  Weaknesses \nimplementation  and \nenvironmental  management  capacity  will  also  be  addressed.  The  Project  will  develop \napproaches to enable a large number of poor and disadvantaged rural households to adopt the \nbiomass technologies. In view of the global, regional, and national benefits associated with the \nProject,  ADB  approached  GEF  for  assistance  in  overcoming  these  barriers  and  providing \nfinancial support for the environment policy implementation and public awareness activities. The \n\nto  environment  policy \n\nrelated \n\n                                                 \n17 TA 2100-PRC: Rural Energy Development Study, for $500,000, approved on 16 June 1994. \n18 TA 3370-PRC: Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes, for $703,000, approved on 26 December 1999. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17\n\nProject,  which  will  serve  as  a  model  for  further  replication  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  was \naccepted into the GEF formal pipeline in June 2000.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironment Protection and Promotion of Clean Technologies \n\n52. \nEfficient utilization of agricultural wastes for biomass energy generation will improve the \nrural  environment  and  reduce  GHG  emissions.  During  project  processing,  the  Mission\u2019s  policy \ndialogue  was  designed  to  encourage  the  Government  to  actively  promote  a  policy  to  adopt \nclean renewable energy, especially in the rural areas. The use of biomass fuels can be a basic \nelement  in  sustainable  development  for  a  densely  populated  country  like  the  PRC.  In  some \nnorthern areas of the country, forests near agriculture lands have been cleared for firewood and \nthe small farmers are now turning to less efficient sources such as straw and animal wastes for \nfuel  and  heating.  Many  rural  households  with  higher  than  average  incomes  have  increasingly \nswitched  to  coal  or  liquified  petroleum  gas.  For  most  of  the  poorer  farm  households,  biomass \ngas provides an appropriate and sustainable alternative. \n \nThe  PRC  has  experience  in  biomass  technology.  Biogas  productivity  from  small-scale \n53.  \ndigesters has increased by 50 percent since the mid-1980s. Recently, more emphasis has been \ngiven to the concept of integrated farming with biomass systems, which aims to enhance farm \nproductivity and improve the environment within a farming system.  \n \n54. \n The Mission emphasized to the Government that the market potential for biogas in the \nPRC  is  considerable  and  that  there  is  scope  for  expansion.  For  example,  more  than  14,000 \nlarge-scale livestock breeding farms exist in the country; but only 5 percent have biogas/sewage \ntreatment  installations.  In  rural  areas,  huge  amount  of  biomass  residues  are  available  for \nbiomass gasification each year. However, most is burned, causing air pollution and respiratory \ndiseases.  The  Government  should  promote  biomass  gasification  technology  to  reduce  crop \nresidue  burning.  Progress  so  far  has  been  limited.  By  year  2000,  there  were  only  about  300 \ncrop residue biomass gasification plants in the PRC, each providing producer gas to about 600 \nrural  households.  The  market  potential  of  biomass  gasification  systems  is  large.  If  only  1 \npercent  of  the  total  amount  of  crop  residues  were  converted  into  producer  gas  by  2010, \napproximately 10,000 biomass gasification systems would have to be installed. The Project will \nprovide  funding  to  assist  the  Government  to  establish  28  biomass  gasification  plants  and  to \nstrengthen  its  institutional  capability  to  provide  technical  support  and  extension  services.  The \nGovernment will ensure that continued funding will be provided to support the development of \nbiomass gasification technology and to ensure its sustainability.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n55. \nThe strategy for industrial growth and agricultural intensification adopted by the PRC in \nthe past decades resulted in environmental problems, particularly air and water pollution linked \nto rapid economic growth and industrialization. Coal is the dominant primary source of energy, \naccounting  for  about  67  percent  of  total  commercial  energy  production.  The  use  of  coal  for \nenergy  production  has  resulted  in  high  levels  of  air  pollution,  causing  major  health  problems, \ndegenerating  ecosystems,  declining  agricultural  production,  increasing  GHG  emissions,  and \noccurrences  of  acid  rain.  Total  GHG  emissions  from  all  components  of  the  agriculture  sector \naccount  for  about  12  percent  of  the  national  total.  These  emissions  are  predominantly  due  to \npoor farming practices and inefficient use of biomass resources. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\nThe  rural  environment  has  been  degrading  as  a  result  of  exploitation  of  firewood  for \n56. \ncommercial and domestic use, production of excess biomass from rural farms and households, \nand  intensive  farming  practices  on  degraded  soils.  These  factors  have  led  to  increased  air \npollution  from  the  burning  crop  residues,  soil  erosion,  and  low  farm  productivity.  Poverty  has \nincreased as natural resources are despoiled and depleted in the rural areas. Farm households \nhave limited access to modern energy sources. The limited supply, high cost, and low quality of \nenergy  have  become  important  limiting  factors  for  rural  economic  development.  Direct \ncombustion  of  large  amounts  of  coal,  firewood,  and  crop  residues  is  contributing  to  the \ndeterioration of the environment. Coal is the dominant fuel source for most households in rural \nareas.  From  an  environment  point  of  view,  the  current  practices  in  energy  utilization  and \nagricultural production in the rural areas have led to increased pollution. Poor farm households \nput enormous pressure on the forests for firewood. The surplus of biomass, primarily due to an \nincrease in crop residues, doubled from about 300 million tons in 1978 to over 600 million tons \nin 2001. Over 100 million tons of crop residues are burned each year in open fields, contributing \nto high levels of air pollution. Air pollution in turn contributes to respiratory illnesses.  \n \nBecause of the lack of proper disposal of household and animal wastes (such as poultry \n57. \nand pig manure), a typical poor farm household is usually littered with decayed vegetables and \nfruits, animal manure, unhygienic latrines, and other household wastes. The situation is worse \nduring  the  wet  season,  when  living  conditions  become  filthy,  causing  health  problems  among \nchildren  and  older  people.  A  significant  reduction  of  such  environmental  pollution  and  health \nproblems  could  be  achieved  through  adoption  of  biomass  technologies  utilizing  agricultural \nwastes or biomass resources.  \n \nThe  PRC  produces  over  10  billion  tons  of  agricultural  wastes  per  year.  Inappropriate \n58. \ndisposal contributes to environmental and groundwater pollution. During the last three decades, \nthe Government has spent significantly to develop biomass technologies that are integrated into \nexisting farming systems. Biogas digesters and crop residue gasification technologies have the \npotential  to  become  increasingly  popular,  particularly  among  small  farmers.  However,  small \nfarmers  face  constraints  in  obtaining  credit  to  adopt  biomass  technologies.  Rural  financial \ninstitutions are reluctant to lend funds to them due to lack of collateral and the large number of \nsmall  loans  involved.  There  is  also  lack  of  a  suitable  financial  modality  whereby  rural  farm \nhouseholds  and  enterprises  could  obtain  longer  term  credit  to  assist  them  in  the  adoption  of \nbiomass  technology.  Such  financial  barriers  can  be  overcome  with  assistance  to  develop  an \nappropriate financial model and mechanisms for longer term lending that could be replicated in \nother parts of the PRC. Although the end users of the biomass technologies are in the private \nsector,  there  is  strong  public  sector  interest  and  significant  environmental  benefits  associated \nwith  the  adoption  of  biomass  technologies.  The  Government  has  made  a  concerted  effort  to \npromote  renewable  biomass  energy  to  improve  the  environment,  enhance  the  quality  and \nquantity  of  agricultural  production,  and  improve  the  health  and  income  of  small  farmers.  Four \nenthusiastic  inland  provinces  (Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi)  have  been  selected  to \nimplement the proposed Project. The four provinces were selected because they represent the \ninland  provinces  with  distinct  climatic  ranges,  have  significant  experience  in  developing  and \npromoting  biomass  technologies,  have  large  proportions  of  poor  farmers  living  in  marginal \nareas,  and  have  expressed  great  enthusiasm  to  implement  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also \nhave demonstration effects on other poorer and less innovative inland provinces by showing the \nfeasibility and profitability of the adoption of biomass technologies as well as promoting private \nentrepreneurs\u2019 participation in the project activities.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  long-term  goals  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  the  environment,  to  promote \n59. \nsustainable  agricultural  production  to  enhance  economic  growth,  and  to  improve  welfare  and \nliving conditions of rural households, particularly the poor farmers. The immediate objectives are \nto  demonstrate  the  economic  viability  of  sustainable  biomass  technology  and  to  enhance \nagricultural productivity and rural income. The objectives will be achieved by (i) developing and \nenhancing  sustainable  biomass  technology  using  agricultural  wastes  to  generate  cleaner \nenergy,  (ii)  introducing  improved  mechanisms  and  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  the \nadoption  of  biomass  technology,  (iii)  improving  rural  marketing  facilities,  (iv)  strengthening \nenvironmental  policy  implementation  and  public  awareness,  (v)  assisting  and  facilitating  the \npoor  and  disadvantaged  group  of  farmers  to  adopt  biomass  technology,  and  (vi)  promoting \nprivate sector participation. The project framework depicted in Appendix 1 provides more details \non the project objectives and activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nScope \n\n60. \nThe  project  scope  comprises  components  that  will  address  and  remove  various \nconstraints and barriers leading to the adoption of biomass technologies in a least-cost manner. \nThe  Project  will  overcome  the  financial  barrier  by  developing  and  establishing  an  appropriate \nfinancing  modality  and  mechanism  that  will  enable  rural  farm  households  to  have  access  to \nlonger term credit for the adoption of the biomass technology. The Project will provide support to \novercome institutional and technical barriers through the provision of management and technical \nassistance to strengthen the concerned institutions to ensure project sustainability and greater \nadoption  of  biomass  technologies.  The  lack  of  public  awareness,  information,  and  marketing \nbarriers will also be addressed through various publicity campaigns, seminars, and information \ndissemination activities. Finally, the Project will address the inability of disadvantaged and poor \nhouseholds  to  adopt  biomass  technologies  through  special  training  and  provision  of  biogas \nadoption facilities. The Project has six components: \n \n\na. \n\nComponent A: Fund Renewable Energy Generation and Eco-\nEnvironment Development  \n\n61. \nThis  component  will  provide  funding  assistance  to  Project  beneficiaries  for  the \ndevelopment  and  adoption  of  biomass  technology  and  will  develop  an  appropriate  financing \nmodel  and  mechanism  based  at  the  provincial  finance  departments  for  extending  longer  term \ncredit  to  rural  farm  households.  A  sustainable  and  replicable  financing  model  will  overcome  a \nkey  barrier,  lack  of  access  to  credit,  that  prevents  farm  households  from  adopting  biomass \ntechnologies.19 The longer term financing will allow the beneficiaries to construct the following:20 \n \n\n(i) \n\n4,700  greenhouses  with  small  biogas  digesters  for  project  farmers  (type  I \ntechnology). This is commonly referred to as the 4-in-1 model ecofarm. The four \nelements  are:  greenhouse,  pigs  (or  other  livestocks)  in  an  integrated  pigpen \ninside  the  greenhouse,  vegetable  crops,  and  a  digester.  The  provision  of \ngreenhouses and digesters will enhance small farmers\u2019 productivity and improve \ntheir incomes. Digested fluids and sludge (manure and household wastes) from \n\n                                                 \n19  Details of biomass technology are given in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n20 The figures given are indicative only, as the number will depend on the actual demand during implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n20\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  pigs  and  household  latrine  provide  the  fuel  for  the  underground  digester  to \nproduce  biogas  for  lighting  and  cooking,  and  for  greenhouse  heating  and  CO2 \ngeneration.  Organic  fertilizer  is  produced  through  the  fermented  sludge  and \neffluents,  and  used  as  an  input  to  improve  greenhouse  vegetables  and  farm \nproduction.  \n\n10,900  smaller  scale  orchard  plantations  with  biogas  digesters  (type \nII \ntechnology). This is commonly referred to as the 3-in-1 model ecofarm. The three \nelements  are  pigs  (or  other  livestock),  orchard  (1  hectare),  and  a  digester.  The \nmodel can also use vegetables, cotton, fishponds, grain crops or other crops to \nsubstitute  for  the  orchard.  Manure  from  the  pigs  and  household  wastes  provide \nthe  source  of  fuel  for  the  digester  to  produce  biogas.  Fermented  sludge  and \neffluents are by-products and are used as organic fertilizer for the farm or for fish \nproduction. Most of type II units are located in the two southern provinces where \nthere is high demand for fresh fruits in the nearby cities. Fresh citrus fruits from \nthe  Project  will  be  sold  to  nearby  cities  such  as  Guangzhou,  Hong  Kong,  and \nShanghai, where the market demand is high.  \n\n14  medium-scale  biogas  plants  (type  III  technology).  The  biogas  plants  will  be \nlocated  in  large  commercial  pig  farms.  Pig  manure  and  other  liquid  wastes  and \nsludge will provide the fuel for the biogas plants. Each plant will be able to supply \nup  to  120  households  and  the  central  pig  farm  with  biogas  for  lighting  and \ncooking.  Organic  manure,  which  is  the  by-product  of  the  plant\u2019s  effluent,  will  be \nsold to adjacent farms. \n\n28  medium-scale  straw  biomass  gasification  plants  (type  IV  technology).  The \ngasification  plants  will  be  located  in  farming  villages  where  there  is  abundant \nwheat or other grain straw that is normally burned in the field after harvesting the \ncrop. The plants will use mostly crop residues for gas production. The gas will be \ndistributed \nlighting,  and  heating.  Each \ngasification plant can supply up to 600 farm households.  \n\nfarm  households \n\nfor  cooking, \n\nto \n\nb. \n\nComponent B: Improve Mechanisms for Transferring Biomass \nTechnology  \n\n62. \nThis  component  will  promote  and  expand  biomass  technology  adoption  through \nprovision of training to biogas contractors, biogas technicians, beneficiary farmers, and medium-\nscale plant operators. The contractors will be assisted so that the investments will be built to the \nstandards  expected.  The  contractors  will  develop  a  large  network  of  private  service \nprofessionals  to  conduct  O&M  and  repair  work  after  the  systems  have  been  constructed. \nFarmers will be trained in O&M of their biogas digesters and on appropriate farming systems to \nbe  adopted  in  the  greenhouse  and  in  the  orchards.  Operators  of  medium-scale  biogas  and \nbiomass gasification plants will be provided with technical training to improve their skills in the \nO&M  of  the  plants.  To  strengthen  their  experience  in  the  efficient  utilization  of  agricultural \nwastes, management, and strategies, project staff will receive training to improve their technical \nexpertise  and  extension  skills.  The  training  will  take  the  form  of  workshops,  study  tours  to \nneighboring provinces, group farm visits, and on the job training. Local research fellowships will \nbe awarded on biomass energy system improvement, environmental protection, and monitoring \nof  biomass  technologies.  Promotion  and  expansion  of  biomass  technology  and  renewable \nenergy policy will be included. Consulting services will be provided to help the local government \nto  develop  and  adopt  appropriate  policies  and  incentives  to  encourage  biomass  technology \n\n \n\n\f21\n\nadoption  in  rural  areas.  This  component  will  integrate  all  elements  of  biomass  technology \nadoption,  incorporating  the  existing  farm  production  system  along  with  strengthening  the \ninstitutions,  and  will  develop  a  viable  private  service  sector  and  incentives  for  continued \noperation  to  ensure  sustainability.  The  number  of  biogas  units  in  each  participating  village  will \nbe  significantly  increased  to  support  at  least  one  or  more  private  service  units.  It  is  expected \nthat more than 300 viable private service units will be established in the project areas. \n \n\nc. \n\nComponent C: Rehabilitate Farm-to-Market Facilities  \n\n63. \nThis  component  will  provide  rural  infrastructure  to  link  agricultural  production  areas  to \nthe existing road network. The Project will construct or rehabilitate about 60 kilometers of rural \naccess roads in the four participating provinces. The component will improve the ability of small \nfarmers  in  the  project  villages  to  develop,  expand,  and  market  their  farm  products  by \nconstructing,  improving,  or  rehabilitating  strategic  access  and  farm-to-market  roads,  drainage \nsystems, and bridges. This activity will result in higher farm incomes, marketing of better farm \noutputs, supply of inputs, easy access by extension officers to promote and enhance biomass \ntechnology adoption by rural households, and easier access to obtain spare parts necessary for \nO&M  of  the  biogas  digesters.  Construction  will  be  undertaken  with  the  cooperative  efforts  of \neach  village\u2019s  farm  labor  on  a  volunteer  basis,  while  the  local  government  will  provide  the \nmaterials. The project implementation agencies will organize the civil works. Road maintenance \nwill  be  done  by  volunteer  farm  labor  supervised  by  village  committees.  About  100  remote \nvillages  with  small-scale  biogas  digesters  will  undertake  this  rural  infrastructure  activity.  It  will \nincrease access to markets, facilitate O&M services, and reduce high transportation costs and \ndamage to produce, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas.  \n \n\nd. \n\nComponent D: Improve Environmental Policy Implementation and \nAwareness \n\nto  assist \n\nimplement \n\nto  effectively \n\nthe  provincial  governments \n\nThis  component  is  designed  to  assist  and  develop  environmental  frameworks  and \n64. \nprograms \nthe  national \nenvironmental  policy,  particularly  in  those  areas  relating  to  biomass  technology  development \nand adoption. It will provide environmental equipment, technical support, and training to improve \nenvironmental policy implementation and awareness and to establish facilities and systems for \nenvironmental  monitoring  to  assure  higher  environmental  standards.  This  will  assist  the \nestablishment  of  a  benchmark  for  environmental  standards  and  the  measurement  of \nenvironmental  impacts  resulting  from  project  activities  to  highlight  the  results  for  public \nawareness so that public and political support is forthcoming for the promotion and expansion of \nbiomass  technologies  in  the  rural  areas.  Such  a  demonstration  effect  will  also  promote  public \nawareness and solicit political support to alleviate environmental pollution. The component will \ndevelop a communication strategy to educate the public to raise public awareness, establish a \nsystem of monitoring emissions of environmental contaminants through provision of monitoring \nequipment  and  training  to  farmers  and  government  officers,  and  mount  public  information \ncampaigns  and  barrier  removal  activities,  including  (i)  facilitating  implementation  of  a  national \nrenewable  energy  policy  framework,  (ii)  developing  a  legal  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation, (iii) improving tax incentives for renewable energy development, (iv) strengthening \nrural  financial  institutions,  and  (v)  promoting  technology  for  the  manufacturing  of  biogas \ncomponents. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\ne. \n\nComponent E: Pilot Poverty-Focused Approaches to Biomass \nDevelopment   \n\n65. \nThis  component  will  introduce  an  improved  and  innovative  biomass  development \napproach  especially  designed  to  assist  the  disadvantaged  and  poor  households.  The \ncomponent will develop appropriate community-based biogas energy programs targeted for the \npoor,  who  would  otherwise  not  be  eligible  to  apply  for  project  credit  facilities  provided  under \ncomponent  A.  Initially,  special  training  materials  for  adult  semiliterates  and  extension  services \nwill be developed for this group of beneficiaries.21 Women\u2019s associations at the village level will \nhelp  farmers  to  participate  in  the  adoption  of  biomass  technology  through  special  training  that \nwill upgrade their technical capabilities, and to prepare subloan applications. To enable the poor \nto participate in the Project (i.e., to be eligible for assistance under component A), they will be \nprovided with basic biogas facilities such as biogas digester, pigpen, and other equipment that \nwill  form  part  of  their  own  equity  contribution,  in  addition  to  their  labor,  for  the  application  of \nproject  financing  to  undertake  the  biogas  production  investment.  A  traditional  household \nassistance model will be adopted to provide assistance to poor families. This involves assigning \na  better-off  and  more  experienced  household  to  aid  the  disadvantaged  and  poor  family  on  a \none-to-one  basis  to  provide  technical  assistance  and  support  to  enable  the  poor  family  to \nsuccessfully  adopt  the  biomass  technology.  Support  to  poor  and  disadvantaged  farmers  is \nimportant because they constitute about 3 million of rural population in the project provinces and \nbecause they are the main users of polluting energy (coal and firewood). The Poverty Alleviation \nOffice  and  other  relevant  bureaus  in  the  PRC  receive  a  substantial  budget  from  the  national \ngovernment (over $600 million annually), and its rural county offices will be actively involved in \nthe project implementation activities for this component. The component will be implemented in \ntwo phases. Phase 1 (years 1-3) involves the selection and provision of assistance to about 15 \npercent of project beneficiaries who live below the poverty line (about 2,353 households). GEF \nfunds will be used to introduce this improved approach in phase 1. In phase 2 (years 4-5), the \nGovernment, through its Poverty Alleviation Office and other provincial offices, will continue to \npilot  test  this  approach  using  its  own  resources  to  finance  another  2,597  poor  households.  A \nsuccessful outcome of this component will enable the Poverty Alleviation Office to replicate the \nactivity in other provinces. \n \n\nf. \n\nComponent F: Improve Project Implementation and Capacity \nDevelopment  \n\n66. \nThe  component  will  provide  consulting  services  to  strengthen  the  coordination  of \ntechnical  support,  improve  the  implementation  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies,  and \nstrengthen their institutional capacity to manage and supervise project implementation activities. \nThe Project will involve the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center (FECC) within the Ministry of \nAgriculture  (MOA),  and  the  provincial  governments  of  Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi  as \nexecuting agencies. The project county governments (either the county agricultural bureaus or \nrural energy offices) will serve as project implementation agencies. The project implementation \ncapability  at  both  the  national  and  provincial  levels  will  be  strengthened  through  technical \nsupport,  incremental  staffing,  and  provision  of  training  to  both  the  finance  and  technical \npersonnel.  Extensive  training  in  financial  management  and  credit  provision  will  be  provided  to \nthe  staff  of  finance  bureaus.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  executing \nagencies\u2019  institutional  capacity  to  implement  and  monitor  all  project  activities.  The  executing \n\n                                                 \n21  The disadvantaged and poor farmer, as defined in the Project, is one who (i) has a per capita income of less than \nY1,000/year; (ii) has limited formal education; (iii) is dependent on coal, firewood, and/or crop straw for heating and \ncooking; (iv) lives under poor sanitary conditions; and (v) lives in a less accessible village. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\nagencies  will  be  supported  technically  and  financially  to  assume  the  coordination,  monitoring, \nand evaluation functions at both the provincial and county levels. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n67. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $77.3  million,  including  price  and  physical \ncontingencies;  interest  during  implementation;  and  other  charges  including  front-end  fees, \ntaxes, and duties. Of the total cost, about $36.3 million or 47 percent is in foreign exchange, and \n$41.0 million equivalent or 53 percent is in local currency. A summary of the cost estimates is \ngiven in Table 1, and details are given in Appendix 3. About 79 percent of total base cost will be \nspent  on  renewable  energy  development  and  eco-environment,  and  about  11  percent  on \nimproving  project  implementation  and  capacity  development.  The  component  on  improving \nproject  implementation  and  capacity  development  is  larger  than  normal  expenditure  item  due \nmainly  to  allocating  all  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  consulting  services  to  this \ncomponent.  In  practice,  the  services  of  PMO  consultants  will  be  distributed  among  all \ncomponents. The interest and other charges, totaling to about $5.3 million, are calculated based \non the current London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based interest rate of 3.8 percent.22 \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \n\nA.

Of the total cost of $77.3 million, the \n68. \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide a loan of $33.1 million (43 percent of total cost) from \nordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will finance about 91 percent of \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of 1 percent; conversion options \nthat  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the Loan Agreement. The local governments will contribute $23.6 million and the beneficiaries \n$14.2 million. GEF will provide $6.4 million on a grant basis.  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \nPercent \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \n\nLocal Governments \n\nBeneficiaries \nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF)a \n         Total \n\n33.12 \n\n1.10 \n\n0.00 \n\n2.05 \n\n36.27 \n\n0.00 \n\n22.49 \n\n14.20 \n\n4.31 \n\n41.00 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n33.12 \n\n23.59 \n\n14.20 \n\n6.36 \n\n77.27 \n\n43 \n\n31 \n\n18 \n\n8 \n\n100 \n\n a    Details  and  components  to  be  financed  by  GEF  are  given  in  Appendix  3,  Table  A3.3.  GEF  Council \napproved the grant in December 2001.The Chief Executing Officer of GEF endorsed the Project in May \n2002. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \nThe  local  counterpart  currency  requirements  will  be  provided  by  the  participating \n69. \nprovincial, municipal, county, and township governments through their annual budgets, and by \nthe  project  beneficiaries,  including  private  enterprises.  Loan  funds  repaid  prior  to  the  project \ncompletion  date  will  be  revolved  by  the  relevant  municipal  and  county  finance  bureaus  for \nfurther  financing  of  type  I  and  type  II  investments,  particularly  to  disadvantaged  and  poor \nfarmers.  \n \n2. \n\nRelending and Onlending \n\n70. \nThe PRC will be the Borrower of the ADB loan. On behalf of the Borrower, the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  will  enter  into  subsidiary  loan  agreements  with  Henan,  Hubei,  Jiangxi,  and \nShanxi as provincial governments subborrowers. MOF will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan \nto the four provincial governments at the same rates and terms for financing component A. The \nfunds will be onlent to the municipal, county, and township finance bureaus at the same rates \nand  terms  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  concerned  finance  bureaus  (county  and  municipal  level),  in \nturn,  will  be  responsible  for  channeling  the  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  to  eligible \nenterprises,  and  to  eligible  farmers  through  the  township  finance  bureaus.  The  ADB  loan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f25\n\nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  50  percent  of  the  cost  of  each  subproject.23  The  provincial \ngovernments and the beneficiaries will contribute the balance of the investment cost, which will \nblend  into  the  ADB  loan.  The  finance  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  recovery  of  the  loan \nproceeds, foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for the small-scale borrowers (types \nI  and  II),  and  servicing  the  debt  obligations  of  the  Borrower.  However,  for  the  medium-scale \nbiogas  and  gasification  plants  (types  III  and  IV),  the  subborrowers  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks. \n \nFarmer  and  enterprise  beneficiaries  will  enter  into  legally  binding  contracts  with  the \n71. \nrelevant  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  and  the  finance  bureaus  (county,  municipal,  or \ntownship)  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  of  the  investment  loan.  The  onlending  interest \nrates to the farmers and enterprises will be no less than the prevailing commercial bank rate for \nsimilar  loans  and  terms.  The  repayment  periods  will  be  based  on  the  projected  cash  flow  and \nprofitability of each type of investment. For types I and II investments, the township will onlend \nto the farmers in local currency with a repayment period of not more than 10 years and a grace \nperiod  of  not  more  than  5  years.  For  types  III  and  IV  investments  for  the  enterprises,  the \nmunicipal or county finance bureau will onlend the ADB loan funds in US dollars with repayment \nterms of not more than 10 years, and a grace period of not more than 5 years, depending on the \nprojected cash flow and profitability of the investment subproject. \n \nThe  finance  bureaus24  will  review  and  appraise  each  subloan  application  and  evaluate \n72. \nits  merits  based  on  the  criteria  to  be  established  by  the  Project.  The  subloan  approach  is \ndemand-based and only the qualified applications will be approved. The eligibility criteria for all \ntypes  of  applicants  are  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  G.  Funds  from  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  will  be  blended  in  a  package  based  on  the  onlending  interest  rate  as  described \nabove. Beneficiary contributions can be in the form of labor, existing assets, and/or cash. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n73.  While the detailed implementation arrangements vary from one province to another, the \nProject will have the following organizational and management structure (see also Appendix 4): \nA National Project Coordination Committee (NPCC), which will serve as the policy-making body \nof  the  Project,  will  be  established  at  MOA  in  Beijing  to  provide  guidance  to  the  four  project \nprovinces on all aspects of policy, implementation, coordination, and issues beyond the control \nof  the  provincial  governments.  Under  the  leadership  of  a  vice  minister  of  MOA,  NPCC  is \ncomprised of senior directors from concerned departments such as the State Development and \nPlanning  Commission;  MOF;  SEPA;  and  representatives  of  MOA  from  the  Department  of \nDevelopment  Planning,  Department  of  Research,  Education  and  Rural  Environment,  Poverty \nAlleviation Office, and FECC as members. At the national level, the PMO will be established at \nFECC  for  overall  project  management,  coordination,  training,  recruitment  of  consultants,  and \nother implementation and monitoring activities. The PMO will be the secretariat of NPCC, and \nthe PMO director will serve as the secretary for the NPCC. The functions of the PMO include (i) \nsupervising  feasibility  studies  of  subloans  (medium-scale  biogas  and  biomass  gasification \n\n                                                 \n23  The  type  I  technology  subproject  cost  ranges  from  $2,000  in  Henan  to  $3,000  in  Shanxi.  The  type  II  technology \nsubproject cost ranges from $2,250 in Hubei to $3,600 in Henan. The type III biogas plant is estimated at $235,78 \nper unit and the type IV gasification plant costs about $131,814 per unit. \n\n24  The  capability  of  the  finance  bureaus  to  assess  subloan  applications  in  the  four  provinces  was  thoroughly \nreviewed, and it was found that they have the experience and capability to undertake the tasks as required under \nthe Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\nto  resolve \n\nplants);  (ii)  reviewing  overall  project  annual  work  programs  and  budgets;  (iii)  supervising \nprocurement  activities;  (iv)  coordinating  and  compiling  project  progress  reports  submitted  by \nPIOs;  (v)  developing  monitoring  indicators,  establishing  a  monitoring  system,  and  evaluating \noverall  project  performance;  (vi)  recruiting  and  supervising  consultants;  and  (vii)  providing \ntechnical  and  management  training  including  training  provincial  officials  on  the  adoption  of  a \nproject performance management system (PPMS). \n \n74.  MOA and the four provincial governments will be the executing agencies of the Project. \nA  provincial  leading  group  (PLG)  will  be  established  in  each  province  to  oversee  project \nimplementation,  review  and  approve  project  plans,  source  counterpart  funding,  effect  inter \nsector  coordination,  and  provide  guidance  and  advice \nfield-level  project \nimplementation  issues.  Each  PLG  will  have  the  vice  governor  as  the  chairperson,  with  senior \ndirectors  of  the  department  of  agriculture,  development  planning  commission,  department  of \nfinance,  women\u2019s  association,  bureau  of  environment  protection,  audit,  and  other  relevant \nbureaus  as  members.  Under  the  administrative  control  of  the  provincial  department  of \nagriculture, a PIO will be established to manage and oversee project implementation activities in \neach province. The duties of the PIO will include (i) organizing and compiling all medium-scale \nbiogas  and  biomass  gasification  feasibility  studies  and  investment  plans  of  types  I  and  II \nsubprojects; (ii) drawing up annual work programs and budgets; (iii) applying approved selection \ncriteria in selecting subprojects of large-scale biogas plants; (iv) reviewing and approving county \nPIUs\u2019 work plans and verifying the costs of proposed subprojects; (v) supervising and managing \nprocurement activities; (vi) supervising construction, inspection, and acceptance; (vii) monitoring \nphysical and financial progress and setting up a PPMS for  monitoring and evaluation results; \n(viii)  coordinating  and  compiling  progress  reports  submitted  by  PIUs;  (ix)  conducting,  in \ncoordination  with  the  county  and  township  implementation  agencies,  periodic  socioeconomic \nsurveys to monitor project impacts; and (x) preparing and submitting withdrawal applications to \nADB.  The  PIOs  will  also  serve  as  the  secretariat  for  the  PLG.  Each  PIO  will  be  staffed  with \ntrained  and  qualified  technical,  financial,  and  management  personnel  and  headed  by  a  senior \nprovincial agricultural department as the PIO director. To ensure strong financial management \nof the Project, a senior official from the provincial Department of Finance will be appointed as \none of the two deputy directors of the PIO to manage all financial aspects of the Project.  \n \nThe county or prefecture governments will set up a leading group and establish the PIUs \n75. \nfor field-level project activities. The PIUs will be located in the Bureau of Agriculture and will be \nsupported by local bureaus of finance, livestock, rural energy offices, poverty alleviation offices, \nand other relevant technical agencies. The municipal and county PIUs in turn will work closely \nwith the township governments and village committees, and with civil society organizations such \nas women\u2019s associations, research institutes, and universities. The county finance bureaus will \nactively be involved in all financial aspects of the Project activities. \n \nThe  provincial  finance  departments  will  be  responsible  for  management  of  the  project \n76. \nfinances.  The  project  funds  will  be  released  from  the  provincial  finance  departments  to  the \ntownship  finance  bureaus,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  PIOs,  and  in  turn \ndisbursed  to  project  beneficiaries.  The  disbursement,  repayment,  and  other  financial  activities \nwill  be  channeled  through  the  relevant  finance  bureaus  for  the  medium-scale  biogas  and \nbiomass gasification plants; and through township finance bureaus to the farmer beneficiaries or \nrural cooperatives in the case of small biogas investors.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n77. \n(Appendix 5).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  five  years  commencing  in  2003 \n\n78. \nAll goods and services to be financed by the ADB loan and GEF grant will be procured in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Most of the loan funds will be used by \nsubloan  borrowers  to  construct  small  and  medium-scale  biomass  systems  integrated  with \nexisting  agricultural  production.  Procurement  will  be  mainly  for  environmental  monitoring  and \ntraining equipment. Most of this equipment is simple and available locally and will be procured \nby the respective provincial PIOs. Supply contracts for equipment and materials are estimated \nto cost less than $500,000 and will be done by international shopping, except those estimated to \ncost less than $100,000, which will be done by direct purchase. The civil works for rehabilitation \nof  local  farm  roads  and  bridges  are  simple,  and  the  materials  will  be  provided  by  local \ngovernments and PIUs with volunteer labor from the local farmers. Other civil works associated \nwith  the  provision  of  basic  biogas  facilities  to  the  poor  farmers  are  relatively  small;  they  are \nunlikely  to  be  of  interest  to  foreign  contractors  and  will  be  done  on  a  force  account  basis. \nIndicative procurement packages are given in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n79. \nConsulting services will be required to assist the executing agencies, through the PMO \nand  PIOs.  All  consulting  services  will  be  financed  by  the  GEF  grant.  International  consultants \nwill be selected and engaged through a firm using the quality-and-cost-based (QCBS) method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.    Domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited through arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The consultants will assist the Government \nin  addressing  key  barriers  that  are  contributing  to  lack  of  widespread  dissemination  and \nexpansion of biomass renewable energy systems. Both international and domestic consultants \nwill  be  engaged  to  develop  synchronized  programs  to  help  in  removing  the  barriers  and  to \noversee the implementation of selected activities; assist in setting up institutional strengthening \nprograms  to  raise  the  skills  of  contractors,  farmers,  and  project  staff;  and  develop  an \nenvironmental monitoring and measurement program. About 45 person-months of international \nconsultants and 117 person-months of domestic consultants will be required under the direction \nof the PMO, and another 142 person-months of domestic consultants will be required under the \ndirection of the PIOs in the four provinces. Terms of references for the consulting services are \ngiven in Appendix 7. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement \n\n80. \nThe Borrower will disburse subloans and eligible expenditures under the Project through \n(i) imprest accounts to be established at the PIOs immediately after the effectiveness date of the \nLoan Agreement; or (ii) ADB\u2019s direct payment, commitment, or reimbursement procedures. An \nimprest  account  will  be  established  within  each  of  the  four  provincial  governments.  Initial \nadvances  will  be  equivalent  to  the  PIOs\u2019  projected  disbursements  to  subborrowers  over  a  six-\nmonth  period,  or  10  percent  of  loan  proceeds,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished,  managed, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure will be used to liquidate advances provided into the imprest account. The accounting \nsystems  and  internal  control  procedures  of  the  Department  of  Finance  in  the  four  project \n\nreplenished,  and \n\nliquidated \n\n \n\n\f28\n\nprovinces  have  been  assessed;  their  financial  controls  and  discipline  are  adequate  for  the \napplication of the statement of expenditure procedure.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Accounts, Audits, and Reports \n\n81.  Municipal and county PIUs will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound \naccounting principles, and sufficiently detailed to identify subloans and subprojects financed by \nthe loan and to disclose the use of funds under the Project. The records and accounts will be \nforwarded  regularly  to  the  provincial  PIOs.  The  PIOs  will  maintain  records  of  all  expenditures \nand  prepare  consolidated  project  accounts.  The  PIOs  will  ensure  that  the  consolidated \nprovincial project accounts are forwarded to the PMO at MOA for final consolidation and to be \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO  and  ADB  will  review \nthese records on a random basis. The audited financial statements will be submitted to ADB not \nlater than nine months after the end of the fiscal year. The PMO, in coordination with the PIOs, \nwill submit consolidated semi annual progress reports to ADB within three months of the close \nof the semi annual period. The semi annual progress reports will follow the project performance \nreport format proposed by ADB and should contain (i) physical and financial accomplishments; \n(ii) project performance indicators; (iii) problems encountered or anticipated, and actions taken; \nand  (iv)  a  work  plan  for  the  next  report  period,  among  others.  Within  six  months  after  project \ncompletion,  the  PMO  will  prepare,  in  coordination  with  the  PIOs,  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion  report  summarizing  the  loan  utilization,  project  implementation,  the  attainment  of \nobjective  and  targets,  and  an  objective  evaluation  of  implementation  experience  and  project \nperformance rating. The executing agencies and PIOs will be informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on \nsubmission of audited financial statements and the strict penalties for noncompliance.  \n \n\n7. \n\nImplementation Reviews \n\n82. \nAt the commencement of project implementation, an inception mission will be fielded to \nfinalize  the  project  administration  memorandum.  Details  on  implementation  arrangements  will \nbe fine-tuned, and further details on the poverty targeting mechanisms and monitoring indicators \nwill  be  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  the  provincial  governments.  In  2005,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will jointly undertake a comprehensive midterm review of the Project to assess its \nimplementation status, review its parameters, and take appropriate measures to further improve \nits  implementation  efficiency  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  its  objectives  and  the  anticipated \nsocioeconomic  impacts.  Annual  review  missions  will  be  conducted  to  assess  implementation \nprogress and examine the appropriateness of the project design and scope, the effectiveness of \npoverty  targeting  mechanisms,  and  the  criteria  for  credit  assistance,  and  to  explore  ways  to \nfurther improve project implementation efficiency. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance and Management System \n\n83. \nThe PMO, in coordination with the PIOs, will establish a PPMS system in the PMO and \nPIOs  to  monitor  and  assess  project  impact  and  the  achievement  of  the  project  objectives. \nSample  surveys  using  the  rapid  rural  appraisal  method  and  household  interviews  will \nsupplement and generate data and socioeconomic information for the PPMS. The impact on the \ntarget beneficiaries, particularly on the poor and disadvantaged groups, will be monitored by the \nPIOs  and  PIUs  with  assistance  from  local  poverty  alleviation  offices  and  the  women\u2019s \nassociations.  Special  poverty-focused  surveys  will  be  conducted  by  local  universities  to \ncomplement the data generated under the PPMS and the results of monitoring and evaluation. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f29\n\n9. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n84. \nDuring project processing, ADB's anticorruption policy was explained to the national and \nprovincial  governments  and  to  the  PMO  and  PIOs  in  the  four  project  provinces,  which  were \nbriefed  on  the  anticorruption  provisions  incorporated  into  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  need  for  PMO  and  PIO  staff  to  observe  the  highest \nstandards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  for  and  implementation  of  ADB-financed  contracts  to \nensure that domestic consultant salaries are fully paid without any deduction; it was explained \nthat  sanctions  will  be  applied  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.  Similarly,  the  section  on \nfraud and corruption in ADB's Guidelines for Procurement was also discussed with the project \nofficials.  \n \nThe Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted \n85. \nwell-publicized  campaigns  against  corruption.  ADB's  country  assistance  program  supports  the \nGovernment  in  improving  governance  and  providing  incentives  to  reduce  the  incidences  of \ncorruption  in  the  long  run.  In  1997,  ADB  provided  TA25  to  draft  procurement  regulations  and \nstandard  bidding  documents.  This  assistance  culminated  in  the  promulgation  of  the  Law  on \nTendering  and  Bidding,  which  became  effective  on  1  January  2000.  The  law  stipulates  that \nbidding activities will follow the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and good faith. The \nlaw  also  specifies  that  no  organizations  or  persons  shall  by  any  means  limit  or  exclude  legal \npersons  or  other  organizations  from  other  regions  or  systems  from  participating  in  the  bidding \nprocedure;  no  illegal  interference  in  any  form  is  permitted  in  the  bidding  process.  Bribes  and \ncollusion  are  prohibited  by  means  of  appropriate  sanctions  for  all  abuses  of  the  law,  including \nsubstantial  fines  and  criminal  prosecution.  Work  is  under  way  under  another  TA26  to  help \ndevelop  and  strengthen  the  implementation  of  the  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  related \nregulations  on  procurement  in  the  public  sector  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  county \nmunicipality levels. In 1998, ADB provided a second TA27 relating to the consulting industry and \nauditing  that  included  the  main  elements  of  ADB's  anticorruption  policy.  In  the  TA,  detailed \nguidelines were developed for selecting and engaging consultants. The Government's auditing \nsystem  is  being  strengthened  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the  Audit  Law  and,  as  far  as \npracticable,  international  auditing  standards.  ADB  is  now  working  with  the  Government  under \nanother TA28 to support good governance, including efforts to combat corruption and ensure the \nrule  of  law  through  the  establishment  of  a  sound  legal  framework  for  the  development  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement system. \n \nF. \n\nThe Executing Agencies \n\n86.  MOA  through  FECC  at  the  national  level,  and  the  provincial  governments  in  Henan, \nHubei,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi  through  their  departments  of  agriculture  at  the  provincial  level,  will \nbe the executing agencies of the Project. All have had considerable experience in implementing \nlocally-funded projects, and all have also implemented foreign-assisted projects such as those \nfunded  by  the  World  Bank,  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization,  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural  Development,  UNDP,  and  bilateral  agencies.  The  executing  agencies  have \n\n                                                 \n25  TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on \n\n20 August 1997. \n\napproved on 14 June 2000.  \n\n26  TA  3457-PRC:  Implementation  of  the  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  Related  Regulations,  for  $565,000, \n\n27  TA 3138-PRC: Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants, for $700,000 approved on 22 December \n1998.  TA  3103-PRC:  Strengthening  the  Government  Auditing  System,  for  $700,000  approved  on  26  November \n1998. \n\n28  TA 3631-PRC: Formulation of the Government Procurement Law, for $578,000, approved on 20 February 2001. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30\n\nestablished a permanent PMO and the provincial PIO organizational structure to be used by this \nProject.  Their  performance  in  past  foreign-funded  projects  has  been  satisfactory.  The  project \nstaff are full-time, permanent, and have significant project implementation experience.  \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Measures \n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken,  and  the  summary  IEE  was \n87. \nprepared during project preparation. Subsequently, each subproject investment will be required \nto  prepare  its  IEE  or  EIA  report  to  submit  to  the  respective  environmental  authorities  for \napproval.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  proposed  Project  will  promote  efficient  utilization  of \nagricultural  waste  products  to  improve  the  physical  environment  in  rural  areas.  The \nenvironmental  benefits  of  the  Project  will  include  reduction  of  CO2  and  SO2  emissions; \nelimination  of  nonpoint  pollution  from  intensive  livestock  production;  and  cessation  of \nexploitation of forests for fuelwood. The Project benefits will also include improvements in health \nand  increased  vegetative  coverage  of  nonproductive  lands  with  fruit  trees.  The  IEE  also \nconcluded that the adverse environmental impacts arising from the four type subprojects will be \nminimized  to  acceptable  levels  through  the  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  programs  included  in  the  Project  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nrequirements and those applicable at the national, provincial, and county levels.    \n \n88. \nTo  ensure  that  all  applicable  national,  provincial,  and  county  environmental  regulations \nand standards, as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements, will be met during implementation \nof the Project, an environmental management and monitoring program will be prepared by the \nPIOs  in  each  province  within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  will  include  the  following \nelements: (i) an environmental management structure for the Project, including responsibilities; \n(ii)  detailed  measures  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  site  environment;  (iii)  an  IEE  for  each \nsubproject; (iv) a program for training and education of staff to ensure that they are up-to-date \non all aspects of the subproject, particularly technology and the environmental implications; (v) \nrelevant  environmental  monitoring  systems  for  selected  sites;  and  (vi)  conduct  of  impact \nassessment  during  and  after  completion  of \nthat  applicable \nenvironmental regulations are adhered to by the investors.  \n \n89. \nThe  provincial  rural  energy  and  environment  protection  stations  will  be  responsible  for \nthe  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  program;  and  the \nprovincial  environmental  protection  bureaus  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  program. \nMonitoring and evaluation results will be reported in the semiannual progress reports on project \nimplementation and in annual reports on environmental monitoring. An environmental evaluation \nreport  will  be  carried  out  one  year  after  completion  of  the  Project.  This  will  be  done  in \ncollaboration with the environmental protection agency in each province. MOA will provide these \nreports  to  ADB.  If  any  subproject  is  cited  for  a  violation  of  any  regulation,  law,  standard,  or \nordinance  related  to  environmental  protection  within  the  reporting  period,  it  must  include  a \ncertification  from  the  environmental  protection  authorities  concerned  that  the  defect  has  been \ncorrected or a corrective action plan has been accepted or approved.  \n \n\nthe  subproject  ensuring \n\n2. \n\nPublic Consultation \n\nFrom  the  time  when  MOA  proposed  the  Project  for  ADB  funding  in  1999,  there  have \n90. \nbeen extensive consultations with all levels of stakeholders. In the four project provinces, MOA \nheld  meetings  with  senior  officials  at  all  levels  of  government  down  to  the  municipalities  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f31\n\ncounties. Officials from the provincial rural energy offices held extensive discussions with village \ncommittees  which  in  turn  held  public  consultations  with  villagers.  During  project  preparation, \npublic  consultation  included  43  public  meetings,  63  in-depth  interviews,  11  participatory  rural \nappraisals and participatory poverty assessments, and 150 household interviews. Villagers were \nengaged in focus group meetings with participants from village people\u2019s committee, community \nleaders,  elders,  women\u2019s  representatives,  and  youth  associations  to  collect  broad-based \nopinions  on  the  Project.  In-  depth  interviews  were  done  to  clarify  the  socioeconomic,  poverty, \nand  environmental  implications  of  the  Project.  Particular  attention  was  given  to  fostering  the \nparticipation of villagers, in particular women, during project preparation. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\na. \n\nSocial and Poverty Assessment \n\n91. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  145  villages  in  37  counties.  A  detailed  social  and \npoverty  assessment  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  All  four  provinces  have  experienced  rapid  growth \nduring the Ninth Five-Year Plan period with annual gross domestic product growth ranging from \nan average of 7.9 percent in Jiangxi to 10.1 percent in Henan. The total rural population in the \nparticipating  counties  is  17.3  million  people,  with  average  annual  per  capita  income  ranging \nfrom Y1,906 in Shanxi to Y2,269 in Hubei. Over half of the population have an average annual \nincome below Y2,000. The average farm size in the four provinces ranges from 3 to 5 mu,29 with \nan  average  household  size  of  3.7  person.  The  main  sources  of  household  income  are  from \ncrops, livestock, and seasonal off-farm employment. Within a village, households share similar \nlivelihoods,  assets,  and  living  standard.  The  majority  of  the  poor  villages  are  located  in \ndegraded hilly land with limited resources and rural infrastructure. \n \n92. \nIn  the  project  counties,  14  percent  of  the  population  are  without  access  to  clean  water \nand about 60 percent of the villages have inadequate or poor sanitation. Less than half of the \nhouseholds  have  toilets  and  waste  disposal  facilities.  About  12  percent  of  the  villages  in  the \nproject areas have no access to basic health services. Lack of fuel and lack of water are the two \nmain  problems  most  often  encountered  by  the  household  women.  Main  sources  of  household \nenergy for cooking are fuelwood, straw, and low-grade coal. Women often have to walk several \nkilometers to fetch water. Excessive use of agrochemicals in current farming practices and the \nhealth  implications  for  farmers  and  consumers  are  of  general  concern  to  farmers.    Financial \nservices in the project areas are not well developed. Access to credit is a major problem among \nthe small farmers who have no collateral. For farmers with access to small loans, the loans are \ngiven only for short periods of 3-12 months.  \n \n93. \nAnalysis  of  income  distribution  in  the  project  area  showed  that  about  3  million  people \nliving in the project area are poor and live in poverty. The percentage distributions of population \nliving below the poverty line in the project areas are about 28 percent in Shanxi, 21.4 percent in \nJiangxi, 18 percent in Henan, and 12 percent in Hubei. Participatory poverty assessments and \nfield  information  collected  indicated  that  the  project  rural  population  can  be  classified  into  four \ndistinct income groups: \n \n\n(i) \n\nAbsolute  Poor. This group consists of families with an average income of less \nthan  Y700  per  capita  per  year.  This  group  includes  about  1.4  million  or \napproximately  7.9  percent  of  the  population  in  the  project  counties.  These \nfamilies require assistance to meet their basic needs. They are (i) those who are \n\n                                                 \n29 15 mu is equivalent to 1 ha. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32\n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nincapable  of  working  and  of  taking  care  of  themselves,  such  as  the  old,  sick, \ndisabled,  and  widows  living  alone;  and  (ii)  those  who  live  in  areas  with  poor \nphysical  resources  and  do  not  have  the  knowledge  to  better  utilize  the  assets \nthey have. In  general,  they have very low levels of education, are illiterate, and \nwithout access to information. \n\nPoor. This group consists of families with income of between Y700 and Y1,000 \nper  capita  per  year.  They  consist  of  about  9.4  percent  of  the  population  in  the \nproject area. In general, these households receive their main income from rain-\nfed agriculture. Their main sources of household energy are fuelwood, straw, and \nlow-grade  coal.  These  households  usually  have  access  to  land  and  labor  but \nhave no access to information and credit.  \n\nVulnerable  Poor.  This  group  consists  of  families  with  an  estimated  average \nincome of between Y1,000 and Y2,000 per capita per year. It is the largest group \n(about 40 percent) in the project area. Their production systems range from rain-\nfed  areas  of  larger  sized  land  (>10  mu)  to  small  irrigated  areas  (3-4  mu).  The \nincome  of  these  families  just  about  covers  the  family  needs.  Sources  of \nhousehold  energy  are  similar  to  those  of  the  poor.  Household  heads  are \ngenerally literate and well informed but have no access to credit.  \n\nNonpoor.  This  group  consists  of  families  with  average  per  capita  income  of \nhigher than Y2,000 per year. It includes progressive farmers, traders, and owners \nof  local  cottage  industries.  The  household  heads  generally  have  at  least \nsecondary  school  education,  and  the  families  have  assets  that  can  be  used  as \ncollateral  for  credit.  In  more  accessible  areas,  households  in  this  group  use \nliquified petroleum gas for cooking, coal for heating, and electricity for lighting. \n\nb. \n\nGender Analysis \n\n94.  Women in the project areas are in general faced with inequality in social status; access \nto resources; access to assets, especially housing and credit; and decision making. In addition \nto  household  work,  women  in  the  project  areas  hold  the  main  responsibility  for  on-farm \nactivities. This is due partly to the fact that 30-40 percent of the men in the project areas do off-\nfarm jobs in or outside of their villages. In most cases, men work on agricultural activities only \nduring the peak season, leaving the women with farm work throughout the year. In most cases, \nthe responsibility for collecting fuelwood and straw, and for fetching water lies with the women. \nStatistics confirm that women work 25 percent longer hours than men and thus have less leisure \nand  sleeping  time.  Illiteracy  among  adult  women  in  the  project  areas  is  double  that  of  men. \nWomen are in a disadvantaged position in absorbing new information and technologies. \n \n95. \nDue to the lack of clean energy for cooking and heating, women in these households are \nconstantly exposed to smoke and dust and therefore have a higher risk of respiratory diseases. \nThus,  the  project  output  to  generate  clean  renewable  energy  (biogas)  will  benefit  women \nsignificantly.  With  access  to  biogas  for  cooking,  about  one  hour  of  cooking  time  will  be  saved \neach  day,  and  the  potential  health  risk  will  be  significantly  reduced.  In  addition,  time  will  be \nsaved on collecting fuelwood or straw for cooking.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n33\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses \n\n1. \n\nIncremental Outputs \n\n96. \nThe Project will provide funds from which borrowers may draw as credit for investment in \nfour  types  of  biomass  systems.  About  4,700,  10,900,  14,  and  28  units  of  type  I,  II,  III,  and  IV \nbiogas systems, respectively, will be established under the Project.  \n \n97. \nIn  the  Henan  and  Shanxi  provinces,  a  total  of  18,800  mu  (1,253  ha)  will  be  cultivated \nunder all type I biogas systems, mainly comprising greenhouse vegetables (e.g., onion, melon, \nand  cucumber);  grains  (i.e.,  winter  wheat,  maize,  soybean,  millet,  and  mungbean);  other \nagricultural crops and livestock such as pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Total annual incremental \nvegetable  production  generated  by  type  I  biogas  systems  is  estimated  at  882  tons  (t).  Total \nannual  incremental  grain  production  will  be  about  312  t,  while  total  annual  incremental  pig \nproduction will be 105,750 heads or about 10,575 t of pork (at 100 kilograms/head). All type I \nbiogas systems will generate a total annual incremental production of 2.82 million cubic meters \n(m3) of biogas, 183,558 t of digested effluents, and 44,310 t of sludge. \n \nType II biogas systems, mainly in Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, will generate a \n98. \ntotal annual increment of 209,280 t of citrus production. Total annual pig production under these \nsystems  is  projected  to  increase  from  21,800  heads  (or  2,180  t  of  pork)  to  109,000  heads \n(10,900 t  of  pork)  or  an  annual  incremental  production  of  87,200s  head  (8,720  t  of  pork).  The \ntype II systems will generate a total annual incremental production of 6.5 million m3 of biogas, \n138,213  t  of  digested  effluents,  and  33,365  t  of  sludge,  which  will  be  used  by  the  farm \nhouseholds.  \n \nIn  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shanxi,  Type  III  biogas  systems  will  generate  a  total  annual \n99. \nincremental  production  of  about  1.2  million  m3  of  biogas,  96,830  pigs  (or  9,683  t  of  pork),  and \nabout 246,500 t of digested effluents and sludge. The type IV gasification systems will generate \na total annual incremental production of about 31 million m3 of producer gas.  \n \n100.  Appendix 9, Table A9.2 provides the details on the production figures of each type of the \nbiomass  system.  The  total  projected  annual  incremental  production  of  crops  and  livestock \naccruing  to  the  Project  is  less  than  1  percent  of  current  agricultural  production  in  the  project \narea. Their impact on local prices of these commodities will be insignificant. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n101.  Financial  analysis  was  carried  out  for  each  of  the  four  types  of  biomass  system. \nAssumptions underlying the analysis are presented in Appendix 9. The financial performance of \neach  individual  biogas  system  was  assessed  using  financial  ratios  that  provide  information  on \nthe  capability  of  these  systems  to  (i)  cover  operating  expenses  (i.e.,  operating  ratio),  (ii) \ngenerate returns (income ratios such as return on sales, return on equity, and return on assets), \nand  (iii)  cover  financial  obligations  (i.e.,  current  ratio,  debt  service  ratio,  and  debt  coverage \nratio).  The  operating  ratios  of  the  biogas  systems  range  from  33  to  95  percent,  with  type  II \nbiogas  systems  exhibiting  the  lowest,  and  type  III  systems,  which  incur  relatively  higher \noperating  costs,  exhibiting  the  highest  values.  All  systems  exhibited  income  ratios  that  are \ngenerally higher than the average cost of capital of 4.3 percent, and all were found to generate \nadequate  funds  from  their  operations  to  cover  financial  obligations  as  exhibited  by  the \n\n \n\n\f34\n\ncreditworthiness ratios (i.e., current ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and debt coverage ratio), \nwhich were all greater than one (Appendix 9).  \n \n102.  Financial  farm  analysis  for  each  biomass  system  was  undertaken  (details  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix D). The financial analysis for a type I biogas system is based on two \ntype I subsystems: (i) type Ia subsystem, which compares full technology adoption vs traditional \ntechnology;  and  (ii)  type  Ib  subsystem,  which  compares  full  technology  adoption  vs  improved \ntechnology. Farms under type Ia subsystem will generate annual incremental benefits of about \nY4,013 (or $485), while those under type Ib subsystem will produce about Y2,478 (or $299). In \nthe case of farms operating type II biogas systems, the financial farm budget analysis indicated \nthat farmers\u2019 income will increase by about Y14,254 ($1,722) per annum at full production. Type \nIII  biogas  systems  will  generate  an  annual  incremental  income  of  Y377,416  ($45,600),  while \nnewly constructed type IV gasification systems, will realize an annual net income of Y246,396 \n($29,769). \n \n103.  The results of the financial analysis indicate that each type of system is financially viable. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the small biogas type Ia subsystem yields a FIRR \nof  about  16  percent;  type  Ib  subsystem,  17  percent;  and  type II,  17  percent.  For  the  medium \nscale type III biogas plant, the FIRR is about 16 percent, while for the type IV gasification plant, \nthe FIRR is about 14 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR values of all types of \nbiogas  systems  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  revenue  and  production  cost  as  implied  by  the \nsensitivity indicator, which exhibits a value greater than one for each corresponding change in \nrevenue, production cost, or both. A delay in benefits by one year will not significantly affect the \nFIRR value of any type of biogas system. The FIRR is also not sensitive to changes in foreign \nexchange rate. In the sensitivity analysis, a 30 percent devaluation rate in the yuan exhibits a \nsensitivity  indicator  of  less  than  one.  The  results  of  the  financial  and  sensitivity  analyses  are \nsummarized in Appendix 9, Table A9.8. \n\n \n3. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n104.  Based on economic benefits derived from investments in biogas systems, the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for the whole Project is estimated at about 18 percent. Details are \npresented in Appendix 9 (Table A9.11).  \n \n105.  The analysis indicates that the Project as a whole is not sensitive to changes in revenue \nand  production  costs,  as  the  sensitivity  indicators,  in  general,  exhibit  values  close  to  one.  A \ndelay in project benefits by one year would have an insignificant effect on the base EIRR. More \nresults and details of the sensitivity analysis are given in Appendix 9, Tables A9.12 and A9.13. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental cum Economic Benefits \n\n106.  The current practices in rural PRC of burning agricultural crop residues in situ, spreading \nuntreated  manure  on  fields,  and  using  coal  and  firewood  with  high  ash  and  sulfur  content  for \ncooking  result  in  serious  long-term  negative  environmental  and  health  impacts.  A  reduction  of \nthese negative effects could be made by replacing traditional fuels (such as coal and firewood) \nwith biogas. Improved use of agricultural wastes will also result in a reduction of pollution and \nGHG  emissions.  The  positive  effects  of  adopting  the  four  types  of  biomass  systems  include  a \nreduction  of  CO2  and  SO2  emissions,  soot,  and  dust  and  reduce  time  spent  on  collecting \nfirewood or straw and on cooking. The Project will also result in an improvement in the health of \nthe beneficiaries, and biogas is more convenient to use for lighting and cooking. A reduction in \nthe  amount  of  dumping  of  untreated  solid  and  liquid  wastes  will  result  in  lower  levels  of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f35\n\ncontamination  in  surface  water  and  groundwater.  By  substituting  biogas  for  firewood,  there  is \nthe  added  benefit  of  reducing  exploitation  of  the  forests,  resulting  in  less  soil  erosion  and \nflooding and better management of natural resources. \n \n107.  The  Project  will  bring  about  significant  benefits  to  the  rural  environment  by  converting \nlarge quantities of agricultural wastes (crop residues, livestock solid and liquid wastes, domestic \nwastes,  etc.)  into  organic  fertilizer  and  biogas  (33  million  m3  per  annum),  thus  eliminating  the \npollution  caused  by  agricultural  wastes  and  reducing  the  burning  of  coal.  The  Project  will \nimprove  the  sanitation  of  farm  households,  as  sanitary  wastes  are  easily  disposed  of  in  the \ndigester, thus alleviating the unclean conditions around and within the house, especially during \nthe  wet  season.  The  use  of  organic  fertilizer,  year-round  greenhouse  vegetables,  and  pig \nproduction will enhance the quality and quantity of farm production, increasing farmers\u2019 income \nand generating incremental workdays.  \n \n108.  The  biogas  produced  will  benefit  the  farm  households  in  terms  of  savings  in  coal  and \nother  energy  costs,  savings  in  cooking  time  for  the  female  household  members,  and  better \nhealth. Project estimates on these are as follows:  \n \n\nSavings  in  Fuel.  The  annual  fuel  saving  per  household  for  each  type  of  biogas \nsystem is about Y512 for households using the type I biogas system, Y624 for using \ntype II, Y77 for type III, and Y187 for type IV.   \n\nSavings in Cooking Time. About one hour per day will be saved when using biogas \nor producer gas instead of conventional fuels such firewood, coal, or straw. Based on \na 12 hour-day worked by the average woman and a daily wage of Y20, the average \nannual saving per household is about Y608 per year.  \n\nImpact on Health. Firewood and coal used for cooking can cause health problems \nconnected  with  smoke  inhalation.  When  biogas  is  used  in  cooking,  there  is  a \nnegligible  emission  of  dust,  soot,  and  CO2  due  to  its  chemical  composition.  The \naverage  household  using  biogas  will  realize  a  saving  of  Y30  per  year  in  medical \nexpenses.  \n\nCO2 Reduction. The Project estimated that the use of biogas will result in reduced \nannual  CO2  emissions  of  about  4.6  t  per  household  per  year  under  a  type  I  biogas \nsystem; 4.2 t under type II, 1.8 t using type III, and 0.7 t using type IV or an annual \naverage  of  about  2.8  t  per  household.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate \nChange has calculated the damage cost of CO2 emissions to be at about Y83/t or an \naverage  value  of  Y232  per  household  per  year.  Table  3  compares  the  CO2 \nemissions of cooking with traditional fuels and that of cooking with biogas. \n\nindicate \n\nthat  CO2  reduction \n\n \nfor \n109.  The  results \nconventional fuels is substantial. For example, in the case of the type I system, the reduction in \nCO2  emissions  using  biogas  for  cooking  is  about  92  percent,  while  for  type  IV  it  is  about  36 \npercent. \n \n \n \n \n\nthrough  substituting  biomass  gas \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Comparison of Emissions of Carbon Dioxide by Type of \nBiomass Gas System Used \n \n\n \nItem \n\nType I \n(1)a \n\nType II  Type III \n(120)a \n\n(1)a \n\nType IV \n(600)a \n\nPer Day: \nEmissions using traditional cooking (kg CO2 /day) \nEmissions using biogas (kg CO2 /day) \n \nPer Year: \nEmissions using traditional cooking (t CO2/day) \nEmissions using biogas (t CO2/day) \nTotal CO2 reduction/ year (t) \nTotal CO2 reduction/ year (%t) \n\n \n13.65 \n1.16 \n \n \n5.0 \n0.4 \n4.6 \n91.6 \n\n \n12.51 \n1.19 \n \n \n4.6 \n0.4 \n4.2 \n90.5 \n\n680.40  3,402.00 \n97.20  2,172.00 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n248.0  1,242.0 \n792.6 \n449.4 \n36.2 \n\n35.5 \n212.5 \n85.7 \n\n  a Number of household for each type of biomass gas system.  \n \n\n5. \n\nUnquantified Long-Term Benefits \n\n110.  Future  savings  based  on  the  reduction  of  damage  to  the  environment  and  the  ensuing \nreduction in clean-up costs are difficult to quantify. In addition, there are costs associated with \nthe reforestation that is required to absorb excess CO2, and the costs of continued soil erosion \nand flood damage. The Project will reduce the deforestation activities of poor households living \nnear forests by introducing biomass technology as an alternative to fuelwood, and will increase \nforest coverage by planting fruit trees on over 10,000 hectares of degraded hillside land, mostly \nin watershed areas. Organic fertilizer made available from biomass technology will replenish the \nland  with  the  macro  and  micro  soil  nutrients  necessary  for  long-term  sustainability  of  soil \ndevelopment.  These  benefits  are  significant,  and  will  increase  over  the  long-term.30  The \nadoption of biomass gasification technologies will result in a significant reduction of smoke from \nburning  crop  residues,  which  will  lead  to  improved  public  health  and  reduced  road  and  air \naccidents.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n111.  The  Project  will  improve  the  environment  and  overall  farm  productivity  in  project  areas \nthrough  an  integrated  agriculture  approach  in  which  agricultural  wastes  will  be  efficiently  used \nfor production of low-cost and cleaner energy sources and improved agricultural production. The \nProject will address the poverty of poor and low-income people. The poverty reduction impacts \nof the Project will be considerable. Within the five-year project period, about 34,080 households \nwill  benefit  directly  from  the  project  intervention:  15,600  households  will  invest  in  small-scale \nbiogas  farming  systems,  and  18,480  households  will  have  access  to  clean  energy  from  the \nmedium-scale  biogas  and  gasification  plants.  The  Project  will  have  a  demonstration  effect  to \nattract  commercial  sources  of  credit  to  provide  loans  for  similar  activities  beyond  the  project \nperiod. About 9,000 poor households with incomes of less than Y1,000 per capita per year will \nbe lifted out of poverty during the project period. \n\n                                                 \n30  Adopting  the  biogas  producer  system  will  contribute  to  gradually  reducing  the  destruction  of  forests  as  less \nfirewood  is  burned.  Forests  act  as  CO2  sink,  helping  in  the  reduction  in  levels  of  CO2  in  the  atmosphere. \nDenudation  of  the  forests  also  contributes  to  soil  erosion,  flooding,  and  changes  in  natural  habitat.  The \nGovernment recognizes the problem and is investing in a major reforestation project.  \n\n \n\n\f37\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n112.  For  participating  households,  the  average  incremental  household  income  for  full \nadoption of type I over the traditional farming system will be Y4,013 ($485), an increase of about \n36  percent.  For  type  II,  the  average  incremental  household  income  will  be  about  Y14,254 \n($1,722), or and increase of 73 percent over the without-project situation. \n \n113.  Adopting type III technology will generate 20,000 local jobs. For each biogas plant, 1,200 \nlabor-days for construction will be required, and 30 jobs will be created in the pig farms. About \n300 villagers (mainly women) will increase their earnings by raising piglets. Jobs will be created \nin  the  upstream  and  downstream  sectors  of  the  local  economy,  including  feed  processing, \nslaughtering,  meat  processing  and  transportation.  Adopting  type  IV  technology  will  result  in \nfinancial  benefits  accruing  to  households  through  switching  to  producer  gas  for  cooking  and \nlighting.  These  benefits  are  derived  from  reduced  medical  expenses  as  a  result  of  cleaner \ncooking conditions, estimated to be over Y1.0 million a year for the whole Project. In addition, \nthe  poor  farm  households  will  have  the  opportunity  to  earn  income  by  bringing  straw  from  the \nfields to sell to the biomass gasification plants.  \n \n114.  Distribution  analysis  conducted  on  quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  shows \nthat the share of benefits accruing to the poor will be about 21 percent of total Project benefit \n(Supplementary Appendix E). This poverty impact ratio of 0.21 indicates that the proportion of \nproject  benefits  that  goes  to  the  poor  exceeds  the  current  poor\u2019s  10  percent  share  in  national \nincome.  \n \n115. \nIn  addition  to  increased  income,  the  Project  will  have  impacts  on  improving  living \nconditions  and  environment.  Sanitary  conditions  in  the  project  areas  will  be  improved  through \nproper disposal and treatments of animal and human wastes. The wastes will no longer be left \nto contaminate household water resources. Rather, through biomass technologies, they will be \ntransformed to organic fertilizers for use in the local farming systems. The availability of organic \nfertilizers  along  with  technical  and  marketing  assistance  provided  by  the  Project  will  make  it \npossible  for  farmers  to  adopt  organic  farming  practices,  which  will  reduce  their  current  health \nrisks due to excessive exposure to agrochemicals. Consumers of reduced-chemical and organic \nagricultural products will benefit from improved quality of agricultural products produced by the \nProject. Environmental protection not only tackles nonpoint pollution problems in the PRC rural \nareas but also helps the poor who are most vulnerable to soil erosion, air and water pollution, \nand poor sanitary conditions.  \n \n116.   Reduction  of  GHG  emissions  and  reforestation  activities  will  have  a  positive  impact  on \nthe  global  environment.  At  the  community  level,  construction  of  type  IV  biomass  gasification \nplants will reduce the problem of air pollution due to burning crop residues in the fields. At the \nhousehold  level,  the  availability  of  clean  energy  to  replace  fuelwood  and  coal  will  benefit  the \ndaily lives of women in terms of both health and the time spent in firewood collection.   \n \n117.    A  pilot  poverty-focused  component  is  included  in  the  project  design  to  target  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  households.  Through  the  Project,  local  officials  and  the  women\u2019s  associations \nwill help in social mobilization to enhance the participation of the poor. Special training programs \nfor  low-skilled  adults  will  be  provided  to  poor  and  disadvantaged  households  to  increase  their \ncapacity to adopt biomass technologies. Because about 40 percent of the men are involved in \noff-farm employment to earn cash income, and the women are mostly responsible for household \nand agricultural work, special attention will be given to developing training programs for women. \nDemonstration  farms  will  also  be  selected  from  poor  households,  and  women  farmers  will  be \nencouraged to become lead farmers to train other farmers. The poor, particularly poor women, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nwill  be  empowered  through  special  training  programs  and  through  the  participatory  process \npromoted by the Project.  \n \n118.  Poor households with basic labor skills but with a lack of capital will be assisted by the \nProject  through  the  provision  of  basic  facilities  in  the  form  of  biogas  digesters,  pigpens,  and \nother  equipment.  The  selection  of  poor  household  beneficiaries  will  be  carried  out  in  a \ntransparent  manner  through  participation  of  representatives  from  village  committees,  women\u2019s \nassociations,  poverty  alleviation  offices,  rural  energy  offices,  the  agriculture  department,  and \nrepresentatives of poor households.  \n \n119.  To  facilitate  adoption  of  the  new  farming  systems  by  the  poor,  a  traditional  household \nassistance model whereby rich or better-off households are assigned to aid poorer households \non a one-on-one basis will be established to provide needed assistance. To facilitate the smooth \nimplementation  of  the  pilot  poverty  component,  participatory  poverty  monitoring  and  feedback \nsystem  will  be  established  and  operated  by  the  Project.  Best  practices  of  poverty  reduction \nexperiences  will  be  systematically  documented  and  publicized  among  domestic  and \ninternational development communities to benefit development efforts elsewhere. \n \n120.  Poor  villages,  which  were  physically  excluded  or \nthe \ntransportation  and  marketing  networks  in  the  past,  will  be  connected  through  rural  roads \nfinanced under the Project. Identification of the location of farm-to-market roads and bridges to \nbe  constructed  will  be  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner  to  ensure  that  the  location  of \ninfrastructure  will  serve  poor  and  disadvantaged  households.  The  poor  will  also  have  a \nsignificant role in constructing and maintaining this infrastructure. The participatory process will \nfoster community ownership and transparency in implementing project activities.  \n \nC. \n\nGender Impacts \n\ninadequately \n\nlinked \n\nto \n\n121.  At the household level, women will benefit from the availability of clean cooking energy \nwhich will reduce their exposure to smoke and dust and therefore lower their risk of respiratory \nand  eye  diseases.  With  households  and  agricultural  wastes  properly  disposed  of  in  biogas \ndigesters, and with reduced use of agrochemicals, the immediate environment surrounding the \nwomen, who spend most of their time on the farm and in the house, will greatly improve. \n \n122.  Women  will  be  empowered  through  training  activities,  through  being  supported  as \ndemonstration  households,  and  through  the  participatory  process  promoted  by  the  Project. \nEvery effort will be made to ensure an equitable gender balance in the selection of beneficiaries, \nwith  special  consideration  to  women  who  are  heads  of  households.  With  the  women\u2019s \nassociations  involving  in  the  implementation  of  the  pilot-poverty  focused  component  of  the \nProject, the needs and concerns of women will be sufficiently addressed. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n123.  The  project  design  includes  measures  to  mitigate  potential  institutional,  marketing,  and \ntechnical  risks.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  face  major  institutional  or  technical  risks. \nHowever, the Project must ensure that the subborrowers are committed to participating in it and \nthat they realize their obligations under the repayment terms for the subloans. There is also the \nneed  to  ensure  that  the  provincial  and  county  financial  bureaus  are  capable  of  administering \nand can manage the loan repayment schemes for different types of subborrowers (type I to type \nIV). With regard to the latter, the Project financing scheme is similar to Loan 1386-PRC: Fujian \nSoil Conservation and Rural Development Project and the recently approved Loan 1814-PRC: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n39\n\nfrom \n\nWest Henan Agriculture Development Project. Experience from the former has been good, and \nno  major  problems  have  been  encountered  in  the  financing  scheme  using  the  provincial  and \ncounty finance bureaus to channel project funds and collect repayments.31 Established criteria \nwill  be  followed  in  selecting  project  beneficiaries.  The  executing  agency  of  the  Fujian  project \ngave  preference  to  poorer  members  of  local  communities.  Project  performance  indicates  that \nabout 54,000 rural households, of which about 37 percent are poor farmer families, have directly \nbenefited \nthe  development  or  rehabilitation  of  20,000  hectares  of  orchards/tea \ngardens/bamboo  plantations  and  the  development  of  lowland  aquaculture.  Average  annual \nincome increases have improved between 10 and 30 percent because of project activities. None \nof the participating farmers now have income below the poverty line, and their quality of life has \nimproved markedly. About 3,700 new employment opportunities have been created and market \ndevelopment  has  improved  access  and  resulted  in  better  prices  for  farm  production.  Key \nelements  contributing  to  the  Fujian  project\u2019s  good  initial  performance  include  (i)  adequate \ncapacity to appraise investment fund and loan appraisals, (ii) good loan portfolio management, \n(iii)  ability  to  establish  an  effective  system  for  debt  collection,  and  (iv)  continued  process  of \ncapacity building. These factors have been built into the project design. \n \n124.  Another  potential  risk  the  current  Project  could  encounter  is  a  lack  of  trained  and \nexperienced  technical  personnel  in  the  private  sector  to  help  service  and  maintain  the \nequipment.  The  project  design  reduces  this  risk  by  providing  substantial  funding  for  training \nprivate  contractors  and  lead  farmers,  who  can  establish  private  enterprises  in  each  project \ncounty  to  provide  maintenance  and  repair  services.  This  will  help  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nproject activities.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n125.  The National Government and the four participating provincial governments have given \nthe following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated \nin the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe PIO will include officials from the poverty alleviation office and the women\u2019s \nassociation  in  the  committee  to  refine  the  selection  criteria  for  poor  farmer \nparticipants  before  the  final  selection  criteria  are  adopted.  The  criteria  will  be \ndesigned  to  ensure  that  at  least  26  percent  of  the  farmers  selected  are  poor \n(farmers with low income, and who suffer from other dimensions of poverty such \nas  poor  sanitary  conditions,  low  level  of  literacy,  and/or  overdependence  on \nfirewood and coal for cooking and heating). \n\n(ii)  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  executing  agencies  will  establish  a \nsuitably  staffed  PPMS  unit  within  the  PMO  and  PIOs.  The  PIOs  will  conduct \nroutine results monitoring evaluations and socioeconomic surveys, and report the \nresults to the Government, GEF, and ADB. \n\n(iii) \n\nAll activities supported under the Project (particularly the type III and IV models) \nwill  meet  national  environmental  standards  and  EIA/IEE  procedures,  which  are \nbased  on  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural \nResources  Development  Projects  and  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects.  No \nCategory A or B subprojects will be approved for financing without an EIA report \n\n                                                 \n31 See the Project Performance Report for the Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development Project (Loan 1386-\n\nPRC). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40\n\nreviewed  and  approved  by  the  respective  provincial  government  environmental \nprotection bureau. \n\n(iv)  MOF will relend the loan fund to the provincial department of finance, which will \nonlend  the  proceeds  of  the  subsidiary  loan  to  municipal  and  county  finance \nbureaus  at  the  same  interest  rates  and  terms  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  local \ngovernments will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available in a \ntimely  manner  for  PIUs  to  implement  planned  project  activities.  With  the \nexception  of  relending  to  types  III  and  IV  enterprises,  the  municipal  and  county \nfinance bureaus, where appropriate, will bear the foreign exchange risks. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe  municipal  and  county  finance  bureaus  will  onlend  their  portions  of  the  loan \nfund to the end users at terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB and at a rate of \ninterest not lower than the rates of interest for equivalent lending by commercial \nbanks. \n\nThe  local  governments  will  ensure  that  adequate  counterpart  funds  are  made \navailable  in  a  timely  manner  for  PIOs  and  PIUs  to  implement  planned  project \nactivities. \n\nEach province will ensure that the PIO and PIUs will obtain, on a timely basis, all \nfunds and resources necessary for the implementation of all project activities, as \nwell as maintenance and management of all project assets. \n\n(viii)  The  provinces  will  ensure  that  the  facilities  are  constructed  and  operated  in \naccordance  with  national  and  local  government  environment  procedures  and \nguidelines. \n\nEach  province  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  Development  during \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  take  all  necessary  actions  to  encourage \nwomen living in the project areas to participate in planning and implementing the \nProject. \n\nEach  province  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts  and  effects  through \nPPMS  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the \nbenefits are maximized. \n\n \n\n\f41\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n126. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $33,119,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Efficient \nUtilization  of  Agricultural  Wastes  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5

For \ninternational  and  domestic \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  to  develop  synchronized  programs  to  assist  in  removing  the \nbarriers; to oversee the implementation of selected activities; to assist in setting up institutional \nstrengthening programs to raise the skills of contractors, farmers, and government service staff; \nand  to  develop  an  environmental  monitoring  and  measurement  program.  The  Project  is \nexpected to develop a sustainable and replicable program that serves as an example to expand \nbiogas/biomass renewable energy systems elsewhere in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \nThe  consultants  will  address  the  major  problems  associated  with  (i)  institutional  barriers,  (ii) \ntechnical barriers, (iii) financial barriers, (iv) public awareness and marketing barriers, (v) service \ninfrastructure barriers, and (vi) disadvantaged and poor household barriers. It is anticipated that \nabout  45  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  117  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  will  be  required  under  the  direction  of  the  PMO,  and  about  142  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants under the direction of the PIOs in the four provinces. The scope of work \nare as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nOvercoming institutional barriers \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\n \n(f) \n\nEstablish sound management support to overcome deficiencies in design, \nquality assurance, environmental monitoring, and technical supervision. \n\nEstablish  project  management  and  coordination  committees  to  promote \nintersector  cooperation  between  different  ministries  dealing  with  biogas/ \nbiomass  technology  and  to  supervise  implementation  of  the  proposed \nGlobal  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  project  and  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of the biogas/ biomass energy program as a whole. \n\nAssist  the  provincial  government  in  formulating  and  implementing  a \nbiogas  energy  program  and  action  plan  aimed  at  expanding  the \ndevelopment  of  small-  to  medium-scale  biogas/biomass  renewable \nenergy systems in the PRC. \n\nAddress  ongoing  policy  and  legal  framework  activities  through  national \nlevel steering committees and close liaison with other ongoing renewable \nenergy  programs  in  order  to  be  part  of  the  strategic  partnership \nagreements now being prepared by various aid agencies in the PRC. \n\nAssist in developing a market approach to expand the implementation of \nbiogas/biomass  renewable  energy  systems  nationwide  and  introduce \norganic farming and certification of organic foods to increase the incomes \nof beneficiaries. \n\nProvide  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  activities  for  the \ngovernment and the private sector so they are better prepared to expand \nthe biogas renewable energy program elsewhere in the PRC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n

Secondary \ninformation  was  collected  from  statistic  offices  of  provinces,  counties,  townships,  and  village \nadministrative offices.  For primary information, series of field assessments were systematically \ncarried  out  in  at  least  one  county  in  each  province,  including  counties  where  the  four  case \nstudies  and  two  feasibility  studies  on  the  investment  models  were  analyzed.  In  all  four \nprovinces, total field assessment activities included 43 public meetings, 63 in-depth interviews, \n11  participatory  rural  appraisals  and  participatory  poverty  assessments,  and  150  household \ninterviews (Table A8.1).  Villagers were engaged in focus group meetings with participants from \nvillage peoples committees, community leaders, elders, and women\u2019s and youth associations to \ncollect  broad-based  opinions  on  the  Project.  In-depth  interviews  were  done  to  clarify  the \nsocioeconomic, poverty, and environmental implications of the Project.  Particular attention was \ngiven to fostering the participation of villagers, in particular women, in all the field assessment \nactivities.  \n \n\nTable A8.1: Summary of Field Activities Conducted by the Consultants \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProvince \nHenan \nHubei \nJiangxi \nShanxi \n\n       Total \n\n \nMeetings \n4 \n21 \n3 \n15 \n\n43 \n\n  \nInterviews \n12 \n19 \n10 \n22 \n\n63 \n\n \nQuestionnaires \n- \n30 \n30 \n90 \n\nParticipatory \nAssessments \n1 \n5 \n2 \n3 \n\n150 \n\n11 \n\n   \n\n \n                  Source: Project feasibility study reports. \n \nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile of Target Beneficiaries \n\nThe target beneficiaries of the Project are the rural population living in 145 villages in 37 \n2. \ncounties of the four provinces namely Henan (9), Hubei (10), Jiangxi (12), and Shanxi (6). While \nthe  rural  population  in  the  37  project  counties  includes  about  17.3  million  people,  the  total \npopulation in project villages in the four provinces is estimated at 208,100 in 55,405 households.  \nTable A8.2 shows the estimated population and households in the project villages.  \n \n\nTable A8.2: Estimated Population and Households in the Project Villages \n\n \n \n \nProvince \nHenan \n\nHubei \n\nJiangxi \n\nShanxi \n\n      Total \n\n \n \nTarget \nVillages \n45 \n\n27 \n\n24 \n\n49 \n\n145 \n\nEstimated \nPopulation \nin the Target \nVillages \n67,500 \n\n \nAverage \nHousehold \nSize \n3.9 \n\n \nEstimated \nNo. of \nHouseholds \n17,310 \n\n \nTotal \nBeneficiaries \nHouseholds \n12,660 \n\n48,600 \n\n37,700 \n\n54,300 \n\n208,100  \n\n3.5 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.8 \n\n \n\n13,885 \n\n9,920 \n\n14,290 \n\n55,405 \n\n11,240 \n\n5,000 \n\n5,180 \n\n34,080 \n\n         Source: Project feasibility study reports. \n\n\f \n\n \n63 \n\n    Appendix 8, page 2    \n\n \n\n \n3. \nThe main sources of household income of the project villages are from crops, livestock \nand  seasonal  off-farm  employment.  Within  a  village,  households  share  similar  livelihoods, \nassets, and living standard. Land ownership is relatively equal. The key factor in higher incomes \nappears to be nonfarm activities.  Up to 40 percent or more of men below 40 years old in the \nproject areas are seasonal migrants, working as construction workers or wage laborers in urban \ncenters in their province or in coastal provinces.  \n \nBasic  services  in  the  project  villages  are  insufficient.  As  high  as  12  percent  of  the \n4. \nvillages in the project areas have no access to basic health services. Infant mortality is high at \nabout  0.5  percent.  About  10  percent  of  the  villages  do  not  have  appropriate  access  to  clean \nwater.  Less  than  half  of  the  villages  (42  percent)  have  access  to  sanitation  and  toilets.  The \nconsequences  are  poor  water  quality  and  ultimately  poor  health.  Main  sources  of  household \nenergy  are  fuelwood,  straw,  and  low-grade  coal  which,  when  used  for  cooking  and  heating, \nhave  strong  potential  to  cause  respiratory  and  eye  problems.    In  some  villages,  women  and \nchildren have to walk up to two hours each day to collect fuelwood and to fetch water.  \n \n5. \nDeforestation  and  soil  erosion  in  mountainous  areas  are  common  to  all  the  provinces. \nPopulation  densities,  which  are  in  excess  of  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  resource  base  along \nwith  their  high  dependency  on  fuelwood  for  energy,  are  the  main  factors  in  the  ongoing \nenvironmental  degradation.    The  majority  of  the  poor  are  concentrated  in  resource-deficient \nareas, mostly in the upland sections of the provinces.  \n \nC. \n\nPilot Poverty-Focused Component \n\n6. \nTo  target  meaningful  levels  of  assistance  to  poor  and  disadvantaged  households, \nincluded in the design of the Project is a pilot poverty component to enhance their participation \nin biomass technologies. As poor farmers may have the necessary labor, land, and resources \nbut lack the necessary skills and assets normally required to benefit from project activities and \ninvestments,  this  project  component  will  directly  help  remove  those  barriers.      The  women\u2019s \nassociation in each village will implement the pilot poverty component under the guidance of the \nPIUs. The poor will be informed about the project activities and the general eligibility criteria1 to \njoin them.  Activities in the pilot poverty component are discussed in paras. 7-9. \n \n7. \nTraining  for  Low-Skilled  Households.    Special  training  materials  targeted  at  illiterate \nor low-skilled adults will be developed in a participatory manner under the Project. Training will \nbe  conducted  using  adult  learning  methods  with  emphasis  on  hands-on  experience  at  farm \nsites.    Training  will  be  carried  out  topic  by  topic  to  avoid  overloading  the  poor,  who  have \nrelatively low absorptive capacity. For necessary follow-up activities, project extension staff will \narrange for a better-off household to pair up with each poor household on a one-on-one basis to \nhelp the poor households operate their biomass integrated farming systems.   \n \n8.   \nDemonstration Households and Training for Women. Demonstration households will \nbe selected on a voluntary basis from among poor farmers, in particular women farmers, to form \na basis for extension activities in the village. Study tours will be organized for poor households \nto  visit  demonstration  households  outside  of  their  villages  or  counties.  Arrangements  will  be \nmade  to  enable  members  of  the  poor  households  to  participate  in  the  study  tour.  Training \n                                                 \n1   General selection criteria of poor households include (i) farmer per capita income below the poverty line of Y1,000 \nper  annum,  (ii)  farmers  with  less  than  three  years  of  formal  education,  (iii)  farmers  with  poor  housing  conditions, \ne.g., house with dirt floor and no glass window, and (iv) households with high dependency on fuelwood/straw and \ncoal for cooking and heating. \n\n\f \n\n \n64 \n\n    Appendix 8, page 3    \n\n \n\ncourses  directed  at  women  will  include  not  only  the  operation  of  biogas  digesters  and  their \nassociated  farming  systems,  but  also  other  topics  including  food  processing,  household \nsanitation, safe use of water, and management of income and expenditures. The schedule and \ncontent of the training courses will be designed with special consideration for women\u2019s needs, \ne.g., shorter hours, closer to the house, and baby-sitters available during training hours. \n \n9. \nBiosystem  adoption  facilities.  To  assist  poor  households,  which  lack  capital,  trained \npoor farmers who meet the basic requirements will be provided with an initial biomass system \nthat  include  biogas  digester,  pigpen,  and  other  basic  fixtures.  The  basic  requirements  for \nreceiving  project  assistance  among  the  poor  households  will  include  (i)  household  with \nappropriate land and at least two adults available full-time and (ii) household with no record of \ncrime and with good reputation for helping others. A preliminary list of poor households selected \nto receive project assistance will be made known publicly to all villagers before final approval. \nThese  poor  household  beneficiaries  will  be  monitored  through  the  participatory  monitoring \nsystem  set  up  by  the  Project.  Lessons  learned  through  implementing  this  pilot  poverty \ncomponent  will  be  systematically  documented  to  expand  these  experiences  to  the  wider \ndevelopment community.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty Impacts \n\n1. \n\nIncome and Employment Impacts \n\n10. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  environment  and  livelihood  of  farm  households  in  Project \nareas  through  an  integrated  agriculture  approach  in  which  agricultural  wastes  will  be  more \nefficiently used for production of low-cost, cleaner energy and improved agricultural production. \nDuring  the  project  period,  34,080  households2  (136,320  people)  will  benefit  directly  from  the \nproject  intervention:  15,600  households  with  small-scale  biogas-farming  systems,  and  18,480 \nhouseholds  with  access  to  clean  energy  from  biogas  enterprises.  About  9,000  beneficiary \nhouseholds will be from poor households below the poverty line. This is depicted in Table A8.3. \n \n\nTable A8.3: Beneficiaries by Type of System \n \n\n \n\n \nType of System \nType I \n\nType II \n\nType III \n\nType IV \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n \nEnterprises \n4,700 \n\n10,900 \n14a \n28b \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n4,700 \n\n10,900  \n\n1,680 \n\n16,800 \n\n34,080 \n\n1,500  \n\n3,300  \n\n400  \n\n3,800  \n\n9,000 \n\nBeneficiary Household \n\nHouseholds with Income \nBelow Y1,000/Capita/Year  \n\na  Each type III enterprise provides biogas to 120 households. \nb  Each type IV enterprise provides producer gas to 600 households. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11. \nIn terms of income benefits, the average annual incremental household income for type I \nwill  be  Y4,013  ($485),  an  increase  of  about  36  percent  from  traditional  farming  systems.  For \n\n                                                 \n2  This  includes  4,700  households  of  type  I;  10,900  households  of  type  II;  1,680  households  to  be  serviced  by  14 \nmedium-scale biogas plants (type III); and 16,800 households to be serviced by 28 gasification plants (type IV). \n\n\f \n\n \n65 \n\n    Appendix 8, page 4    \n\n \n\ntype  II,  the  average  annual  incremental  household  income  will  be  Y14,254    ($1,722)  or  an \nincrease  of  73  percent  over  the  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  situation.  At  full  development,  annual \nincremental  agriculture  products  produced  during  the  project  period  will  be  882  tons  (t)  of \nvegetables, 312 t of grain, 209,280 t of citrus fruits, and 289,780 pigs. An area of 8,066 hectares \nof  degraded  mountainous  land  will  be  reforested  with  fruit  trees.  A  number  of  upstream  and \ndownstream  economic  activities  associated  with  the  biogas  farming  system,  e.g.,  pig  feed \nproduction, vegetable processing and servicing of biogas digesters will also be promoted. The \nconstruction  of  type  I  and  type  II  will  require  about  2  million  labor-days  from  the  households. \nLower income households will have an opportunity to provide their services for this activity. It is \nestimated that lower income families will provide half of the labor requirement. \n \n12. \nFor  type  III,  20,000  labor-days  of  local  employment  will  be  generated.  For  each  plant, \n1,200 labor-days for construction will be required, and in addition to 30 jobs created on the pig \nfarm,  300  farm  households  will  increase  their  earnings  by  raising  piglets  on  contract.  A  large \nnumber of jobs including feed processing, slaughtering, meat processing, and transportation will \nbe created for the local economy. For type IV, it is estimated that financial benefits of over Y1.0 \nmillion per year will be realized for the whole Project.  These benefits will be derived from the \nreduced  cost  of  producer  gas  and  reduced  medical  expenses  as  a  result  of  cleaning  cooking \nconditions. In addition, the poor will have the opportunity to earn income by bringing straw from \nthe fields to sell to the gasification plants.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNon-Quantifiable Impacts \n\n \n\n13. \nApart  from  income  and  employment  impacts,  other  indirect  benefits  generated  by  the \nProject will include, for example, lower food prices, better food availability, better quality of food \n(organically grown vegetables), time savings in cooking, cleaner air, cleaner soil and water, and \nbetter  public  sanitation  practices.  Excessive  use  of  agrochemicals  in  current  farming  practices \nand its health implications for farmers and consumers, which are of general concern to farmers, \nwill  also  be  reduced  by  the  Project.    Recycling  of  on-farm  agricultural  resources  will  lower  the \ncost of agricultural production. This is likely to bring wider profit margins for poor who are food \nproducers  and  also  net  food  consumers.  The  poor  will  benefit  more  than  the  nonpoor  from \nproject outcomes that affect public goods and other goods needed to satisfy basic human needs \nlike clean water, energy, and transport because these normally claim a higher proportion of the \nincome of the poor household than of the better-off household.  \n \n14.  Women  in  the  project  areas  anticipate  that  through  the  increased  employment \nopportunities  generated  by  the  Project,  the  majority  of  men  who  are  seasonal  migrants  will \nreturn  to  take  over  the  main  responsibility  for  farm  work  in  the  villages.    This  will  lessen  the \nexcessive  burdens  of  farm  work,  household  work,  and  single  parenting  currently  carried  by \nwomen.  The  poor,  and  in  particular  the  women,  will  be  empowered  through  training  activities \nprovided by the Project. Every effort will be made to ensure an equitable gender balance in the \nselection of beneficiaries, with special consideration for women who are heads of households.   \n \n15. \nIdentification  of  the  location  of  roads  to  link  the  clusters  of  project  investments  to  the \nexisting  road  networks  will  be  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner  to  ensure  that  locations  of \ninfrastructure  will  serve  poor  and  disadvantaged  households.  At  the  same  time,  the  poor  can \nalso  have  a  significant  role  in  constructing  and  maintaining  infrastructure.    The  participatory \nprocess  will  also  foster  community  ownership  and  transparency  in  implementing  project \nactivities.  \n\n\f                                                                              66 \n \n\n    Appendix 9, page 1        \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAssumptions \n\nTypes of Biomass Systems \n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  financial  analysis  focuses  only  on  the  viability  of  the  representative  farm  models \nenvisaged to evolve under the Project. The analysis is based on incremental revenues derived from \nthe sale of agricultural crops and livestock for types I, II, and III biogas systems, and from the sale \nof biogas (for type III system) and producer gas (for type IV system) and incremental costs incurred \nin farm development, working capital, farming operations, and operation and maintenance. The \neconomic analysis was carried out for each type of biogas system and for the Project as a whole \ncovering all six components. The project life is assumed at 25 years, including an implementation \nperiod of five years. Costs included in the economic analysis consist of incremental capital and \noperating costs including physical contingencies, but excluding price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand subsidies. Economic costs and benefits are derived by adjusting financial costs and benefits by \na standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and a shadow wage rate of 0.8. \n \nB. \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  funds  from  which  potential  borrowers  may  draw  as  credit  for \n2. \ninvestment in four types of biogas units. It is expected that about 4,700, 10,900, 14, and 28 units of \ntype I, II, III, and IV biogas systems, respectively, will be established under the Project. Type I \nbiogas farming systems consist of a biomass digester and greenhouse (area of about 0.5 mu1 or \nabout 333 square meters [m2]) for the production of vegetables and pigs with an annual throughput \nof  30  heads.  The  average  farm  has  a  cultivated  area  of  four  mu.  The  financial  and  economic \nanalyses take into consideration two scenarios in assessing the viability of investments in type I \nbiogas systems. The first scenario determines the incremental costs incurred and benefits derived \nby a farm that has fully adopted type I biogas technology (i.e., construction of a biomass digester \nand a greenhouse, which represents the \u201cwith Project\u201d situation) and compares these with a similar \nfarm  applying  traditional  farming  technology  (i.e.,  no  biomass  digester  and  greenhouse,  which \nrepresents the \u201cwithout Project\u201d situation). This is presented in the analyses as the type Ia biogas \nsubsystem. The second scenario evaluates the incremental costs and benefits of a farm with a \ndigester  and  greenhouse  (representing  full  technology  adoption  under  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  situation) \nrelative to one with a greenhouse but without a biogas digester (considered as improved type I \nbiogas  system  under  the  \u201cwithout  Project\u201d  situation).  This  is  presented  as  the  type  Ib  biogas \nsubsystem in both the financial and economic analyses. Of the total 4,700 units of type I biogas \nsystems to be established, 2,350 units, or 50 percent, are assumed in each scenario. \n  \n3. \nType II biogas farming systems mainly produce orchard crops (area of about 15 mu) such as \ncitrus,  and  an  annual  throughput  of  10  pigs  to  supply  the  manure  requirements  of  its  biogas \ndigester.  Type  III  biogas  farming  systems  are  large  pig  farms  that  are  operated  by  farming \ncommunities or groups of individuals, consisting of breeding and fattening stock with an annual \nthroughput of 10,000-15,000 fattened pigs. These systems will generate additional income from the \nsale of biogas to consumer households for cooking and lighting as well as from the sale of digested \neffluents and sludge as farm fertilizer. Type IV systems are mainly biomass gasification plants that \nproduce producer gas, which will be sold to user-households. The plant consists of a gasifier, a gas \ntank, building facilities, and biogas distribution facilities. In the analyses, it is assumed that new type \nIV gasification systems will be constructed under the Project. The number of biogas system in each \nprovince is presented in Table A9.1. \n\n                                                 \n1 1 ha = 15 mu. \n\n\f                                                                              67 \n \n\n    Appendix 9, page 2        \n\n \n \nTable A9.1: Biogas System Investments by Province \n\n \n\n \nProvince \nHenan \nHubei \nJiangxi \nShanxi \n     Total \n\nType I \n(units) \n1,200 \n- \n- \n3,500 \n4,700 \n  Source: Project feasibility study reports. \n\nType II \n(units) \n1,500 \n4,400 \n5,000 \n- \n10,900 \n\nType III \n(units) \n8 \n2 \n- \n4 \n14 \n\nType IV \n(units) \n15 \n11 \n- \n2 \n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nProduction \n\n \n \n \n4. \nIncremental costs incurred by the biogas systems include incremental investment costs, \nworking capital requirements, and operating costs incurred during their operation. Investment costs \ninclude  capital  investment  in  the  construction  of  greenhouses,  pigpens,  toilet  facilities,  biogas \ndigesters, and biogas distribution facilities.  \n \n2. \n \n \n \nA  total  of  about  4,700  farm  households,  each  cultivating  about  4  mu  (2,668  m2),  are \n5. \nexpected to invest on type I biogas systems. In the provinces of Shanxi and Henan, a total of \n18,800 mu (1,253 hectares [ha]) will be cultivated under all type I biogas systems comprising grains \n(i.e., winter wheat, maize, soybean, millet, and mungbean), greenhouse vegetables (e.g., onion, \nmelon, and cucumber), and livestock, such as pigs and a few cattle, sheep, and goats. Incremental \nproduction generated by type I biogas systems is based on production estimates under two type I \nsubsystems:  (i)  type  Ia  subsystem,  which  compares  full  technology  adoption  vs  traditional \ntechnology;  and  (ii)  type  Ib  subsystem,  which  compares  full  technology  adoption  vs  improved \ntechnology. The estimated incremental vegetable area under each subsystem is about 0.5 and 0.25 \nmu,  respectively,  or  a  total  incremental  vegetable  area  of  about  1,175  mu  for  type  Ia  biogas \nsubsystem  and  587.5  mu  for  type  Ib  biogas  subsystem.  The  annual  incremental  vegetable \nproduction  will  be  of  0.6  tons  (t)  and  0.3  t  for  type  Ia  biogas  subsystem  and  type  Ib  biogas \nsubsystem, respectively; the corresponding total annual incremental vegetable production for type \nIa biogas subsystem and type Ib biogas subsystem is about 705 t and 177 t, respectively, or a total \nannual  incremental  vegetable  production  for  all  type  I  biogas  systems  of  882  t.  Total  annual \nincremental  grain  production  is  about  312  t  while  annual  incremental  pig  production  is  about \n105,750 heads or about 10,575 t of pork (at 100 kg/head). All type I biogas systems will generate a \ntotal annual incremental production of about 2.8 million cubic meters (m3) of biogas, 183,558 t of \ndigested effluent, and 44,310 t of sludge (Table A9.2). \n \nAbout 10,900 farm households, each comprising about 15 mu (about 1 ha) for citrus orchard \n6. \nproduction, will invest in type II biogas systems, mainly in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and \nJiangxi. Under the \u201cwith Project\u201d situation, each type II biogas system is assumed to be planted with \nabout 700 citrus trees and will produce about 10 heads of pigs annually. Under the \u201cwithout Project\u201d \nsituation, a type II system is assumed to cultivate 189 citrus trees and produces two pigs. The new \nsystem will produce about 24 t of citrus on a 1 ha orchard area (about 34.3 kg/tree) compared with \nthe same type of system under the \u201cwithout Project\u201d situation, which produces 4.8 t on an orchard of \n0.27 ha (about 25.4 kg/tree). Total annual citrus production under the \u201cwith Project\u201d situation is \nabout 261,600 t compared with about 52,320 t under the \u201cwithout Project\u201d situation or an annual \nincremental citrus production of 209,280 t. Total annual pig production will increase from 21,800 \nheads to 109,000 heads or an incremental production of 87,200 heads or about 8,720 t of pork.

A typical type III system will produce \nabout 87,600 m3 of biogas annually, which will be distributed among consumer households. An \nannual incremental biogas production of about 1.2 million m3 will be produced by type III biogas \nsystems. Under the \u201cwith Project\u201d situation, these systems will produce a total of 144,520 pigs \ncompared with about 47,690 under the \u201cwithout Project\u201d situation or an annual incremental pig \nproduction  of  96,830.  The  type  III  biogas  systems  will  produce  an  annual  increment  of  about \n198,684  t  and  47,822  t  of  digested  effluent  and  sludge,  respectively.  Total  annual  incremental \nvolume of digested effluent and sludge produced will be about 246,506 t (Table A9.2). \n \n8. \nAbout 28 gasification systems (type IV systems) will be established. One gasification system \n(type IV system) will produce about 1.1 million m3 of producer gas. Each gasification system will be \nnewly constructed. The annual incremental production of producer gas is estimated at about 30.7 \nmillion m3 (Table A9.2).  \n \nThe total projected annual incremental production of crops and livestock accruing to the \n9. \nProject is less than 1 percent of current agricultural production in the project area.

Under  the  \u201cwith  Project\u201d  situation,  new  investments  will  be  made  by \nproject beneficiaries in the various types of biogas systems. Total investment in each type of biogas \nsystem is as follows: (i) type I, Y20,750 (or about $2,500)2; (ii) type II, Y27,245 ($3,283)3; (iii) type \nIII, Y1,957,000 ($235,784); and (iv) type IV, Y1,094,056 ($131,814). The investment on each type of \nsystem will require an equity contribution of 25 percent from the beneficiaries, 25 percent from the \ngovernment, and 50 percent from a credit loan fund.  \n \n12. \nLoans for type I biogas systems will have a maturity period of ten years. This includes a \ngrace period of not more than five years from the year of establishment, with repayment on principal \nloan and interest commencing in Year 6 until Year 10. Credit for type II biogas systems is assumed \nto mature in 10 years, with a grace period of not more than five years from year of establishment \n(i.e., from Year 1 to Year 5) and loan repayments commencing in Year 6, when the citrus trees start \nto bear fruits, until Year 10. Although the type II biogas systems will generate positive cash flow on \nthe first year of production, revenues will be derived mainly from pig production and will not be \nsufficient to cover interest charges and repayments on principal loan. An adequate cash flow will be \nrealized in Year 6 when the citrus trees start bearing fruits.  \n \n13. \n\nIn the analysis, loans for type III systems are assumed to have a maturity period of ten years \n\n                                                 \n2  As  the  investment  costs  in  Henan    province  and  Shanxi    province  are  Y16,600  ($2,000)  and  Y24,900  ($3,000), \nrespectively, an average investment cost of Y20,750 ($2,500) was used in analyzing the financial viability of the type I \nbiogas system. \n\n3  As the investment costs in Henan province, Hubei province, and Jiangxi province are Y29,800 ($3,600), Y19,920 \n($2,250),  and  Y18,675  ($2,400),    respectively,  an  average  investment  cost  of  Y27,245  ($3,283)  was  used  for \ndetermining the financial viability of the type II biogas system, which includes purchase of planting materials and trace \nelements. \n\n\f                                                                              70 \n \n\n    Appendix 9, page 5        \n\nwith a grace period of not more than five years (i.e., from Year 1 to Year 5).

The financial revenue from biogas sales is based on a market price of \nY1.20/m3 which, in turn, was converted into economic value using a price correction factor of 0.89 \nand 0.71 for type III and type IV systems, respectively.4 All economic benefits were expressed in \n2001 constant terms and were projected over a 25-year period. Incremental economic benefits were \nestimated from the difference between the economic revenue and cost streams of each biogas \nsystem  which,  in  turn,  served  as  the  basis  for  estimating  the  incremental  economic  benefits \ngenerated by all investments in the various types of biogas systems under the Project. \n \n28. \nEnvironmental economic benefits accruing to the Project, in terms of cost savings, such as \nsavings in fuel, reduction in cooking time, and medical savings resulting from positive impact on \nhealth were also quantified and included in the calculation of the economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) value for the Project as a whole.  \n \n29. \nThe financial value of annual fuel savings per household for each type of biogas system is \nestimated at about (i) Y512 for households under type I biogas systems, (ii) Y624 for households \nunder type II biogas systems, (iii) Y77 for households sourcing biogas from type III biogas systems, \nand (iv) Y187 for households deriving biogas from type IV gasification plants. Multiplying these \nestimated  savings  by  a  conversion  factor  of  1.29,  1.15,  0.89,  and  0.71,  respectively,  the \ncorresponding economic value of fuel savings per household for each type of biogas system is at: \n(i) Y660 for households under type I biogas systems, (ii) Y717 for households under type II biogas \nsystems,  (iii)  Y69  for  households  using  biogas  from  type  III  biogas  systems,  and  (iv)  Y133  for \nhouseholds sourcing biogas from type IV gasification plants. \n \n30. \nA saving of one hour/day in cooking time, on average, is estimated when using biogas or \nproducer gas instead of conventional fuels. Based on a 12-hour day worked by the average woman \nand a daily wage of Y20, the average annual saving per household, in financial terms, is calculated \nat Y608. Applying a shadow wage rate of 0.8, the economic value of savings in cooking time is \nestimated at about Y487 per year. \n \n31. \nFirewood  and  coal  are  inefficient  fuels  for  cooking  and  can  cause  health  problems \nconnected to smoke inhalation. On the other hand, biogas used in cooking has negligible emission \nof dust, soot, and carbon dioxide (CO2) due to its chemical composition. It is estimated that the \naverage household using biogas can realize a financial saving of Y30 per year in medical expenses \nor, applying a SCF of 0.9, about Y27 per year.  \n \n  The  Project  will  generate  considerable  economic  benefits  in  terms  of  reduction  in  CO2 \n32.   \nemissions. This, subsequently, will have positive effects on the environment. The use of biogas \nresults in reduced CO2 emissions of about (i) 4.6 t per household under type I biogas systems, (ii) \n4.2 t per household under type II, (iii) 1.8 t per household using biogas from type III systems, and \n(iv) 0.7 t per household using biogas from type IV gasification plants or an annual average of about \n2.8 t per household. As a consequence, total annual CO2 emission is envisaged to be reduced by \n36-92 percent or about 75 percent per year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has \ncalculated the damage cost of CO2 emissions to be at about Y83/t or an average financial value of \nY232/household/year. This is about Y209/household/year in economic terms. These, however, are \n\n                                                 \n4  The price conversion factor applied in converting the financial price of biogas to economic value for type III and type IV \nbiogas systems is calculated based on the market prices of liquified petroleum gas and coal, adjusted by their thermal \nefficiency, in terms of biogas and producer gas.  \n\n\f                                                                              76 \n \n\n    Appendix 9, page 11        \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nnot included in the calculation of the EIRR. \n \n \n \n33. \nThe resulting economic net present value shows that the Project is expected to generate \napproximately Y553.19 million for the economy. Including environmental economic benefits (i.e., \nsavings in fuel, reduction in cooking time, and medical savings), the EIRR of the whole Project is \nabout  18  percent.  The  summary  of  results  of  the  economic  analysis  for  the  whole  Project  is \npresented in Table A9.11. \n \n \n \nSensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the effect of variations in the estimated \n34. \nbenefits of the Project. The analysis indicated that the Project as whole is not very sensitive to \nchanges in revenue and production costs, as the sensitivity indicators, in general, exhibit values \nclose to one. A delay in Project benefits by one year as well as a devaluation in the yuan by 30 \npercent  likewise  indicate  insignificant  effects  on  the  base  EIRR.
