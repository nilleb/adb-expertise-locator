It will also build the foundations for the country\u2019s \neconomic  recovery  using  a  coordinated  response  led  by  the  country,  with  support  from  its \ndevelopment partners. The proposed loan will provide general budgetary support for: (i) social \nassistance to the poor and vulnerable groups and populations at risk; (ii) a strengthened health \nsystem to prevent and control  COVID-19; and (iii) micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(MSMEs) and workers to insulate them from the economic downturn. \n \nMyanmar sustained strong growth averaging 6.4% in 2015\ua7f72019 and maintained sound \n3. \nmacroeconomic conditions. It has also reported only a moderate number of confirmed COVID-19 \ncases  to  date.  However,  the  country  is  highly  vulnerable  to  economic  shocks  because  of  its \ndependence on trade and tourism, and to future surges of the pandemic because of its limited \npublic health capacity. Disruptions to key economic sectors and  to trade and investment flows \nstand  to  derail  the  strong  growth  trajectory.  ADB  revised  its  projection  of  Myanmar\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth in 2020  from 6.8% to 1.8%\u2014equivalent to economic losses of \n$3.3 billion. COVID-19 may slow Myanmar\u2019s significant progress in poverty reduction because \nlarge poor and vulnerable populations are least able to cope. It will result in an estimated loss of \n1.2  million\ua7f72.1  million  jobs  and  is  likely  to  increase  the  number  of  the  poor  by  1.3  million.2 \nMoreover, the poor living conditions in urban areas, the porous borders with a large migrant labor \npool  of more  than 4  million  people, and  limited water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  expose  the \ncountry to future outbreaks. \n \n4. \nThe government is implementing a $2.5 billion COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP) \nduring  fiscal  years  (FYs) 2020 and 2021.3 The  CERP  was designed  to  raise  preparedness  for \nCOVID-19 surges, mitigate the current economic impact through social assistance and support \nto MSMEs and workers, and help the economy bounce back. The government\u2019s total financing \nrequirement is expected to increase from $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion in FY2020, and to $4.5 billion \nin  FY2021;  of  which  $1.7  billion  in  FY2020  and  $1.5  billion  in  FY2021  will  be  financed  by \nconcessional borrowing from development partners. The risk of public debt distress will remain \nlow  despite the  COVID-19 pandemic,  i.e., below the  public  debt  sustainability  threshold  of  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). The CARES Program is aligned with the operational priorities \n(OPs) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1), \naccelerating progress in gender equality (OP2), promoting rural development and food security \n(OP5),  and  fostering  regional  cooperation and  integration  (OP7).4 It  builds upon ADB\u2019s trusted \nrelationship  with  the  government  through  continued  engagement,  and  will  supplement  the \nongoing health, social, and finance sector responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Myanmar meets \nall the access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO (Table 1).5  \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2020.

Debt sustainability \n\n6. Coordination with IMF \n\nincluding  ADB  and  various  stakeholders \n\nADB Assessment \nADB revised Myanmar\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 from 6.8% to 1.8%, equivalent \nto economic losses of $3.3 billion. Construction, manufacturing, and tourism \nhave  been  hit  hard.  As  a  result,  2.1  million  people  may  lose  their  jobs, \npushing  1.3  million  people  into  poverty.  The  fiscal  deficit  is  expected  to \nwiden to 5.8% of GDP in FY2020, from the pre-shock estimate of 2.6%. In \na more adverse scenario with wider community spread of COVID-19, GDP \ncould  contract  further  in  2020. The  already  weak  health  care  system  was \nconsiderably  stretched  by  the  pandemic,  raising  concerns  about  possible \nsubsequent waves of the disease.  \nThe  government  announced \nthe  CERP,  a  pro-poor  countercyclical \nexpenditure  program  of  $2.5  billion.  It  will  support  public  health,  social \nassistance  through  cash  and  in-kind  support,  and  economic  measures  to \ncontain  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  support  the  poor  and  vulnerable \ngroups. About 44% of the package will be in the form of health-related and \nsocial  assistance  expenditures.  The  government  consulted  with \nin \ndevelopment  partners \nformulating  the  CERP.  Staff  applied  ADB\u2019s  conflict\u2013sensitive  approach  to \nensure  that  the  CERP  has  adequate  provisions  for  supporting  all  ethnic \ngroups living in different parts of the country without any differentiation.  \nMyanmar  sustained  strong  growth,  averaging  6.4%  in  2015\u20132019,  with \nstable  inflation  averaging  7.1%.  It  maintained  sound  macroeconomic \nconditions  and  desirable  policies  within  a  sound  budgetary  framework. \nFiscal  and  monetary  policies  were  moderately  accommodative.  Improved \nbudget  execution  and  debt \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s debt by the Central Bank of Myanmar financing to be phased \nout in FY2021, as originally envisaged. \nMyanmar took steps to strengthen its health system, prevent the spread of \nCOVID-19, and manage the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. It set \nup the National Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment of \n2019 Novel Coronavirus, chaired by the State Counsellor, to coordinate and \nmonitor the COVID-19 responses. It tasked the COVID-19 Containment and \nEmergency Response Committee, chaired by Myanmar\u2019s Vice President 1, \nwith  overseeing  health  responses,  including  those  in  the  CERP,  such  as \ncommunity  surveillance,  quarantine  and  risk communication,  public  space \ndisinfection,  expanding  laboratory  and  clinical  capacity,  and  ensuring \nadequate health human resource and medical equipment and supplies. \nPublic  debt  will  remain  sustainable  despite  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The \nratio of public debt to GDP is expected to increase from 39.5% in FY2019 to \n43.6% in FY2020 and 45.2% in FY2021. This is still below the IMF\u2019s public \ndebt  sustainability  threshold  of  55%  of  GDP.  The  proposed  CPRO  will \nincrease the debt to GDP ratio by 0.38%. \nADB  is  in  close  contact  with  the  IMF  on  macroeconomic  monitoring, \nparticularly  on  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  fiscal  responses.  The  IMF \nprovided an assessment letter confirming that the fiscal stimulus under the \nCERP  will  be  instrumental  in  containing  the  adverse  health,  social,  and \neconomic impacts of COVID-19. The IMF approved the first tranche of its \nRapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument of $356.5 million for \nMyanmar  on  26  June  2020,  and  its  board  will  consider  a  planned  second \ntranche by December 2020. \n\nissuances  allow  monetization  of \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CERP = COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO \n= COVID-19 pandemic response option, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary \nFund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nHigh risks of COVID-19 surges despite few cases. As of 3 August 2020, Myanmar had \n5. \n353  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  and  6  deaths.  Approximately  20,000  people  were  under \ninvestigation and quarantined in dedicated facilities. The Yangon region accounts for 70.5% of all \nconfirmed cases. The country\u2019s testing capacity was scaled up from 320 tests per day to 2,000 \ntests per day. However, the total number of tests performed per million population remains the \nlowest  in  Southeast  Asia.6 The  risk  of  community  outbreaks  remains  high  among  vulnerable \npopulations including: (i) returning migrant workers; (ii) internal migrant workers and people living \nin overcrowded urban and peri-urban areas in Yangon; and (iii) people in conflict-affected areas \nwho lack basic livelihood and health care services. \n  \n6. \nInadequate public health system. The World Health Organization (WHO) assessed the \nability of Myanmar\u2019s health system to detect, prevent, and respond to pandemics as limited.7 The \nhealth-related public expenditure per capita stood at $8.6 in 2017 and remained one of the lowest \nglobally. 8  Most  facilities  operate  with  inadequate  premises,  equipment,  and  supplies.  The \nshortage  in  and  limited  technical  capacity  of  health  care  personnel  has  been  a  continuous \nchallenge, particularly in hard-to-reach or conflict-affected areas. The numbers of doctors (0.68), \nnurses  and midwives  (1.0), and  hospital  beds  (0.9)  per 1,000  inhabitants  are  below the  lower \nmiddle-income country average and WHO-recommended levels. The Health Sector Contingency \nPlan (HSCP) which lays out measures to improve pandemic preparedness, foresees the current \nhealth system being quickly overwhelmed if a community outbreak occurred.9 It is imperative to \nscale up laboratory testing, clinical management capacity, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. \n \n7. \nEconomic growth trends reversed. While the full extent of the public health impact is \nyet  to  be  seen,  the  economy  will  suffer  from  disruptions  to  economic  activities  as  well  as  the \ndownturn in trade and investment. ADB revised its projection of Myanmar\u2019s economic growth for \n2020  to  1.8%  from  a  pre-COVID-19  estimate  of  6.8%.10 The  pandemic  is  expected  to  entail \neconomic losses of $3.3 billion, equivalent to 3.4% of GDP (footnote 2). Wider community spread \nand interactions with fiscal and finance sector vulnerabilities may lead to a greater contraction in \ngrowth in 2020 and a more sluggish recovery. COVID-19 has affected the economy through three \nprimary transmission channels: (i) manufacturing and construction; (ii) tourism; and (iii) trade and \ninvestment flows, including remittances.  \n \nKey affected industries. Construction (6.1% of GDP) and manufacturing (25% of GDP) \n8. \nare the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 containment measures. Output losses from the \ntwo-week  lockdowns  in  April  2020  are  estimated  at  82.9%  for  construction  and  40.7%  for \nmanufacturing.11 Several construction projects and contracts had to be postponed or canceled. \nIn manufacturing, shortages of material and order cancellations from European countries led to \n\n \n\n6  A total of 118,127 tests were conducted from 22 March 2020 to 3 August 2020 (2,064 tests per million population).  \n7  Myanmar  was  rated  2  out  of  5  in  each  capacity  area.

Yangon. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nfactory closures, particularly in the garment segment. By 10 May 2020, 175 out of 600 garment \nfactories had closed because of COVID-19. In addition, travel bans, border closures, and visa \nsuspensions directly impacted the tourism industry, which accounts for 6.8% of GDP and 5.9% of \ntotal employment, with spillover effects on hotels, restaurants, and transport services (together \n15.2% of GDP). International tourist arrivals dropped by 68% year-on-year in the first quarter of \n2020. The Ministry of Hotels and Tourism projected that international arrivals would fall to 2 million \nfrom the earlier estimate of more than 4 million in 2020, with significant downside risks. \n \nDisrupted trade and investment flows. Myanmar\u2019s high reliance on international trade \n9. \nand investment exposes it to vulnerabilities. Exports and imports represent 52.7% of GDP. Export \ngrowth  slowed  to  0.13%  in  March  2020  from  1.7%  in  December  2019,  especially  in  garment \nindustries.  Likewise,  import  growth  declined  to  0.16%  in  March  2020  from  1.5%  in  December \n2019,  particularly  in  manufacturing  and  construction  materials.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  also \ndisrupted investment flows (30% of GDP). In October 2019\u2013June 2020, the Myanmar Investment \nCommission approved $4.4 billion (MK6.1 trillion) in investments. However, total new investment \ncommitments in FY2020 will most likely miss the target of $5.8 billion given the overall sentiment.12 \nFurther, there are also downside risks if all the approved investments will materialize given the \ngeneral regional and global economic slowdown.  \n \n10. \nSignificant job losses. COVID-19 has already caused dramatic declines in employment \nand  income  in many  households.  ADB estimates  that  the  pandemic  will  result  in  job  losses of \n1.2 million\u20132.1 million, equivalent to 5.1%\u20138.7% of total employment (footnote 2). COVID-19 also \nexposed  gender  inequalities  in  business.  Women  represent  60%  of  employees  in  food  and \naccommodation services, 70%\u201390% of street food vendors, and vast majorities in the garment \nindustry. This suggests that women are more vulnerable to unpaid leave or unemployment. About \n83% of the country\u2019s 24 million workers are in the informal sector, with more than half working in \nagriculture and small family businesses, or as own-account workers (61.8% of working women \nand 54.1% of working men). Informal sector workers are typically not eligible for social protection \nbenefits, and only 37% of workers in the formal sector are covered by the social health protection \nscheme. Disruptions in agriculture supply chains, coupled with declining farm household incomes, \nalso cause concern about insufficient agricultural production in the next planting season, which \ncould seriously undermine food security in Myanmar. \n \n11. \nDisruption  of  remittances.  Business  closures  in  neighboring  countries, especially  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Thailand,  has  resulted  in  job  losses  among  migrant \nworkers. It is estimated that 4.25 million Myanmar nationals are working outside of the country, of \nwhich one-third are women. By 12 June 2020, 103,163 migrant workers had returned to Myanmar \nfrom Thailand, the PRC, and other countries.13 In 2019, overseas work contributed about 50% of \ntotal new job opportunities.14 Remittances, on average, contribute 44% of household income and \n4.3% of GDP. The sudden absence of remittance income may result in higher poverty. \n \n12. \nCOVID-19 to slow progress in poverty reduction. The 2017 poverty headcount ratio \nindicates that 19.3% of Myanmar\u2019s population lived under the poverty line of $3.2 per day. Before \nthe pandemic, this was expected to further decline to 11.5% in 2020. ADB now estimates that the \nnumber of poor people will increase from 6.3 million to 7.6 million, and that the projected poverty \n\n \n\n12 Ministry of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations.

Yangon. \n14 Ministry of Labor, Immigration and Population. Nay Pyi Taw. \n\n\fheadcount ratio will increase from 11.5% to 13.9% in 2020.15 Women are at greater risk of falling \nback into poverty than men because they account for the majority of workers in many economic \nsectors  affected by  COVID-19, notably manufacturing,  food,  accommodation,  and  the  informal \nsector.  Low-income  and  rural  households  also  face  vulnerabilities  in  non-income  dimensions, \nsuch as access to education, social protection, and quality health care. Given that 62% of the \npopulation do not have savings, many have no buffer against COVID-19\u2019s economic shocks.16  \n \n13. \nBanking  system  already  constrained.  Myanmar\u2019s  banking  system  has  been  going \nthrough  reforms  to  better  support  the  growing  economy  but  still  exhibits  several  structural \nvulnerabilities. 17  Its  financial  soundness  indicators  are  lower  than  those  of  regional  peers, \nespecially capital adequacy and banking profitability. Moreover, risks remain high and could be \nexacerbated by the economic impact of COVID-19. In private banks, real estate and construction \nloans exceed aggregate capital, and commercial loans are  about 7 times the aggregate equity \ncapital.  Yet, capital buffers are  thin.  Myanmar  banking\u2019s aggregate  Tier 1  regulatory  capital  is \n10.8% of risk-weighted assets, against 15.8% on average in Southeast Asia. In 2019, the banking \nsector\u2019s aggregate return on assets and equity was among the lowest in the region. \n \n14. \nFiscal deficit widening. COVID-19 has exacerbated revenue compression, which further \nlimits  the  fiscal  space  to  counter  economic  impacts.  The  government\u2019s  revenue  in  FY2020  is \nprojected to decline by 18.1%, from $12.7 billion to $10.4 billion, with significant downside risks \n(Table 2). Tax and nontax revenues have declined along with economic activity and commodity \n(gas) prices. Public expenditure in FY2020 is projected to remain at $14.4 billion, but that is only \nthe  result  of  deferring  critical  capital  expenditures  to  prioritize  COVID-19-related  recurrent \nspending needs. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5.8% of GDP in FY2020, from 4.0% in \nFY2019 and the pre-shock estimate of 2.6% in FY2020. \n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Fiscal Impacts of COVID-19 \nFY2020 \n\nFY2019 \n($ billion) \n\nPre-COVID-19 \n($ billion) \n\nTotal government revenue \nOf which: Taxes \n                  Nontax revenue \n\nTotal public expenditure \n\nRecurrent expenditure \nOf which: CERP expenditure \n                  Capital expenditure \n\nOverall fiscal deficit \n       Share to GDP \n\n11.0 \n4.5 \n6.5 \n13.7 \n9.2 \n \n4.5 \n2.8 \n4.0% \n\n12.7 \n4.4 \n8.3 \n14.4 \n9.1 \n \n5.3 \n1.8 \n2.6% \n\nCOVID-19 \nAdjusted \n($ billion) \n10.4 \n4.2 \n6.2 \n14.4 \n9.9 \n1.3 \n4.5 \n4.0 \n5.8% \n\nFY2021 \n($ billion) \n\nChange \n(%) \n\n(18.1) \n(4.6) \n(25.3) \n0.0 \n8.8 \n \n(18.2) \n122.2 \n3.2 \n\n11.2 \n4.6 \n6.6 \n15.6 \n10.8 \n1.0 \n4.8 \n4.4 \n5.8% \n\n( )  =  negative,  CERP  =  COVID-19  Economic  Relief  Plan,  COVID-19  = coronavirus  disease,  FY  = fiscal  year, GDP  \n= gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on International Monetary Fund. \n \n15. \nInitial outbreak prevention and control.

The 6 systemic banks account for 51% of system assets and 65% of total system lending. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ndevelopment partners, formulated the HSCP in April 2020, which defines the health-related tasks \nof:  (i) implementing  travel  restrictions  at  points  of  entry;  (ii)  closing  schools  and  non-essential \nbusinesses,  and  issuing  a  nationwide  \u201cstay  at  home\u201d  order;  (iii)  isolating  suspected  cases  at \ndesignated hospitals and conducting contact tracing; (iv) distributing COVID-19 information to the \npublic, including daily updates on the MOHS website; (v) improving hygiene in public areas; and \n(vi)  procuring  essential  medical  products  and  equipment.  The  health-related  measures  in  the \nCERP are designed to support the HSCP implementation. \n \n Strong pro-poor countercyclical expenditure plan.  The government announced the \n16. \nCERP  on  27  April  2020  to  mitigate  the  COVID-19  impacts  and  to  lay  the  foundations  for  an \neconomic recovery. The CERP comprises health, social, and economic measures. The Ministry \nof Planning, Finance and Industry (MOPFI) estimates that the CERP will stimulate fiscal spending \nby  approximately  $2.5  billion,  including  $203.5  million  in  forgone  tax  revenue  because  of  tax \ncredits and deductions. The key fiscal measures are summarized in Table 3. ADB estimates show \nthat the $2.5 billion fiscal package, including forgone tax revenues (3.7% of GDP), could lead to \na  cumulative  increase  in  real  GDP  of  $3.3  billion  for  FY2020  and  FY2021.18 ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners were consulted in the preparation of the CERP. \n \n\nTable 3: Overview of Government\u2019s COVID-19 Economic Relief Plana \n\nFiscal Response Area \n\nSocial assistance provided to vulnerable groups and populations at risk \nHealth system strengthened for COVID-19 prevention and control \nSupport provided for businesses and economic recovery \nTax relief and credit measures, including government fee waivers \nTotal  \n    Of which:  Government revenue losses \n                     Additional fiscal spending \n\nAmount ($ million) \n   711.4 \n   372.8 \n1,190.0 \n   203.5 \n2,477.6 \n   203.5 \n2,274.1 \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na  The detailed cost estimates by fiscal response area are in Summary of Government\u2019s COVID-19 Economic Relief \n  Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSources: Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry and Asian Development Bank. \n \n17. \nStrengthening  public  health system.  The  CERP  designates  five  investment  areas  to \nstrengthen  the  health  care  system:  (i)  extend  and  improve  quarantine  facilities;  (ii)  import  key \nmedical products; (iii) improve preventive measures; (iv) improve health sector human resource \ncapacity;  and  (v) upgrade  existing  health  facilities.  The  government  repurposed  7,772  public \npremises  into  quarantine  facilities  as  of  15  June  2020.  It  is  implementing  the  systematic \ndisinfection of crowded public spaces where social distancing is difficult and sanitation and waste \nmanagement systems are limited. Mass rapid testing options are being explored as communities \nand businesses  reopen. States and  regions  will conduct human  resource  mapping and  recruit \nadditional  health  workers.  Training  for  the  workforce and  volunteers  will  be  conducted  in each \nstate  and  region.  Finally,  the  government  will  scale  up  laboratory  testing  and  health  facilities, \nrectify  the  unreliable  electricity  supply  at  some  state  and  regional  hospitals,  and  ensure  full \nrefrigeration capacity for the storage of vaccines and special drugs.  \n \n18. \nCash and in-kind support to vulnerable populations. The government will provide one-\ntime cash transfers to vulnerable population segments, including: (i) $21.50 per elderly person \n(80\u201384 years old); (ii) $14.30 per disabled person; (iii) $21.50 for each woman with children under \n2  years  of  age;  and  (iv) $28.50  per  family  covering  about  5.5  million  vulnerable  households, \n\n18 Estimating the Overall Fiscal Impact of COVID-19 Response Packages (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\n \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\fespecially those affected by the closure of factories and businesses or without regular income.19 \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Irrigation  plans  to  provide  financial  support  to \nsmallholder farmers who lost sales revenue or remittance income, to enable input purchases in \ntime  for  monsoon  planting  in  2020.  It  will  also  provide  support  for  enhancing  productivity  and \nmarket  connectivity  in  the  agriculture  sector.  The  government  has  completed  in-kind  (food) \ntransfers  for  4 million  vulnerable  households  and  is  coordinating  the  cash  transfer  program.  It \nexempted 4.4 million households from electricity tariffs for up to 150 kilowatt-hours in April\ua7f7June, \nand up to 75 kilowatt-hours in July 2020. \n \n19. \nFiscal measures to safeguard small businesses and workers. The government set up \na $71.7 million COVID-19 Fund to provide working capital to the most affected MSMEs, such as \ncut\u2013make\u2013pack manufacturing, hotels, and tourism businesses, at a rate of 1% for 1 year.20 It \nprovided working capital to 3,000 MSMEs, of which 30% are owned by women, totaling $65 million \nas of June 2020. It plans to increase the COVID-19 Fund by $358 million. The government will \nalso develop a credit guarantee scheme by the end of 2020.21 The scheme will guarantee 50% of \nbank loans to enterprises (up to a turnover of MK1 billion) that are not beneficiaries of the COVID-\n19 Fund, conditional upon maintenance of staff employed as of 1 February 2020.22  \n \n20. \nTax measures to improve liquidity. Through the CERP, the government will provide tax \nrelief and tax credits to increase the liquidity of businesses and individuals. It will waive the 2% \nwithholding tax on exports and specific goods, customs duties, and the commercial tax on critical \nmedical  supplies  and  products  related  to  the  prevention,  control,  and  treatment  of  COVID-19. \nMoreover, the government will provide a 10% nonrefundable tax credit for incremental wage bills \nand  incremental  investments  in  capital  equipment.  It  will  grant  a  deduction  equal  to  125%  of \nwages  paid  and  a  one-time  increase  in  depreciation  equal  to  125%  of  actual  depreciation  for \n2020. To relieve the financial burden on local businesses, the government will exempt lease fee \ncharges for 3\u20136 months for MSMEs that have leased state-owned factories for manufacturing and \nwaive or reduce toll fees for cargo trucks on major roads and bridges. The total forgone revenue \nfrom all these measures is estimated at $203.5 million.  \n \n21. \nCoordinated  monetary  and  banking  responses.  The  government  initiated  monetary \nand banking system stimulus measures to respond to the economic impacts of COVID-19. The \nCentral  Bank  of  Myanmar  (CBM)  reduced  banks\u2019  deposit  and  lending  rates  by  3%  and  their \nminimum  reserve  requirement  by  at  least  150  basis  points. 23 It  plans  to  establish  an  asset \nmanagement company before the end of 2020 to manage the nonperforming loans of the banks. \nThe CBM also arranged to negotiate with private financial institutions to give more flexibility  to \nhouseholds  that are most  negatively  affected by COVID-19.  The  CBM\u2019s financing of  the  fiscal \ndeficit is limited to $932 million in the FY2020 supplementary budget (37% of domestic financing) \n\n \n\n19 The cash transfer program for pregnant women and children under 2 years of age is an extension of the ongoing \nMaternal and Child Cash Transfer Program. For the cash transfers to 5.5 million households, the Ward and Village \nTract Administrators will conduct means-tests to identify vulnerable households.  \n\n20 The eligibility criteria apply to businesses that (i) are affected by COVID-19, (ii) can restart their business once the \nloan  is provided,  (iii)  obtained business  permits  before  31 March  2018, (iv) have  had annual  profits  over  the  last  \n2 years, (v) have capacity to repay the loan, (vi) will use the loan only for the payment of salaries and operational \ncosts, (vii) are not on any of the government\u2019s black lists, and (viii) have paid the business tax. \n\n21 The ADB is also preparing the Enhancing Financial Access through Public Credit Guarantee Scheme Project, which \nwill provide support for the government to set up a new government credit guarantee corporation, with due regard to \nbank credit risk practices and reporting. \n\n22 To be financed by the government\u2019s funds or by funding sources from other development partners. \n23 In 2020, the CBM cut its policy interest rate by 0.5% on 12 March, 1.0% on 24 March, and 1.5% on 28 April. The \nminimum deposit rates were reduced from 8% to 5%, the maximum lending rates from 13% to 10% for collateralized \nloans, and from 16% to 13% for uncollateralized loans. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nand will be gradually phased out as the economy begins to recover. Box 1 provides a snapshot \nof the COVID-19 impact and summarizes the key response measures taken by the authorities. \n \n22. \nLessons learned. The proposed CARES Program takes into account the experience and \nlessons  from  other  CARES  Programs  in  the  region,  notably  that  (i)  budget  support  for  the \ncountercyclical expenditure program is necessary to mitigate the adverse impact on health and \nsocioeconomic  outcomes  and  to  reinstate  market  confidence,  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  continued \nengagement  through  regular  policy  dialogue  and  investment  programs  is  instrumental  in \nmanaging  the  unfolding  impacts  of  COVID-19.  The  CARES  Program  will  also  include  a \ncomprehensive monitoring and reporting framework involving committees and technical working \ngroups (TWGs) under the government and engage the private sector and stakeholders throughout \nits implementation. It was designed in close consultation with other development partners, such \nas the IMF, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the WHO, and the World Bank. \n  \n\nBox 1: Snapshot of COVID-19 Impact in Myanmar \n\n \nMyanmar\u2019s vulnerabilities in the pandemic situation \n\n(ii) \n\n(i)  While the COVID-19 infection rate has been low so far, the poor living conditions in urban areas \nand the porous borders with a large migrant labor pool of more than 4 million people, all in the \ncontext of a weak health system, considerably expose Myanmar to future outbreaks. \nThe  economic  impact  is  unprecedented\u2014job  losses  of  1.2 million  to  2.1  million  are  expected, \nand  the  number  of  the  poor  is  likely  to  increase  by  1.3  million  people.  More  than  25%  of \nmanufacturing establishments have already shut down, and more such closures are expected. \nSince more than 80% of the labor force is employed in the informal sector, 70% of them women, \nthe social impact will be quite severe. \n\n(iii)  Conflict-affected areas are likely to be more vulnerable if large-scale outbreaks occur. \n(iv)  Recovery in low-value manufacturing businesses, construction, and tourism is likely to be slow \nand highly dependent on regional recovery. Knock-on effects are likely to be felt in the banking \nindustry. \nThe  fiscal  impact  of  the  crisis  is  severe\u2014a  sharp  revenue  compression  will  lead  to  the  fiscal \ndeficit widening to 5.8% of GDP and net financing needs increasing to $4.18 billion. \n \n\n(v) \n\nMeasures taken by the authorities \n\nFirst-phase response to shore up the country\u2019s health facilities, with ADB support \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Design of the CERP in a comprehensive manner, with a focus on social, economic, and fiscal\u2013\n\nfinancial aspects, and keeping an eye on facilitating a swift recovery \n(iii) \nSenior leadership engaged in the design, implementation, and monitoring of the CERP \n(iv)  Commitment to ensure that the CERP support will be distributed in an equitable manner across \n\nall ethnic groups and regions, including in areas where internally displaced people live \n\n(v)  Concerted  dialogue  and  partnership  with  development  partners,  including  the  International \nMonetary  Fund  by  seeking  $700  million  Rapid  Credit  Facility  and  Rapid  Financing  Instrument \nassistance and initiating discussion on debt service suspension \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CERP = COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nProposed Program, Impacts, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n\n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  CARES Program  is  aligned  with ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy for  Myanmar, \n2017\u20132021, by supporting sustainable and inclusive economic development, and job creation for \npoverty reduction.24 The impact of the program will be to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-\n19 on health, livelihoods, and the economy.

The program has three outputs: (i) social assistance provided to the poor \nand  vulnerable  groups  and  populations  at  risk;  (ii)  health  system  strengthened  for  COVID-19 \nprevention and control; and (iii) MSMEs safeguarded and workers supported during the economic \ndownturn. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  value addition.  The  CARES  Program  leverages  ADB\u2019s  continued  engagement \nwith Myanmar and complements its projects for health, social assistance, and job creation. The \nprogram  will  be  complemented  by  technical  advice  and  knowledge  support  under  the  country \nengagement framework.25 In addition, ADB serves as a catalyst for development coordination and \nparallel financing. It closely engages with the MOPFI to jointly monitor the socioeconomic impacts \nof the pandemic. Through a regional technical assistance, ADB will provide policy and technical \nadvice  to  the  government  to  effectively  implement  the  CERP.26 The  program  also  adheres  to \nADB\u2019s conflict-sensitivity approach (Box 2). \n \n\nBox 2: Conflict-Sensitivity Approach of the Program \n\n \nObjectives of conflict-sensitive approach \nADB  applies  a  conflict-sensitive  approach to  all  its  operations  in  Myanmar.  This  seeks  to  ensure  that \nADB  assistance  will  (i)  not  exacerbate  ongoing  conflicts,  (ii) contribute  to  inclusive  development  with \nequitable  benefits  to  all  communities,  and  (iii)  not  be  disrupted  by  local  conflicts.  A  panel  of  conflict \nadvisors advises ADB on the evolving political, economic, ethnic, and other conflict-related situations. \n \nApplication of conflict-sensitive approach to the program \n\nThe  government  has  provided  full  assurances  in  its  development  policy  letter  that  the  CERP \nresources will be channeled to all segments of the vulnerable population of Myanmar, without \nany differentiation or discrimination. Those with the utmost needs will be supported, regardless \nof who the beneficiaries are including the most vulnerable and ethnic minorities, as well as those \nliving in areas affected by past and current conflicts. \nThe government has deployed rapid response teams to manage outbreaks and operate mobile \nclinics to deliver life-saving health care services in conflict-affected areas.  \nThe  Maternal  and  Child  Cash  Transfer  Program  and  cash  and  in-kind  (food)  transfers  to \nvulnerable households and populations at risk include internally displaced persons in camps. \nA country engagement framework will be established as part of the CARES Program to enable \n(a) policy dialogue between the government and ADB, (b) monitoring, and (c) updating on the \ngovernment\u2019s countercyclical measures, which will ensure equitable coverage of the CERP for \nall states and regions.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CERP = COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n25. \nADB supports all three areas of the CERP.

Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the ratio of public \ndebt to GDP was expected to decline from 39.5% of GDP in FY2019 to 36.9% in FY2020, and \nthen increase to 37.2% in FY2021. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the public debt trajectory is \nnow expected to rise to 43.6% of GDP in FY2020 and to 45.2% in FY2021\u2014but still below the \nIMF\u2019s public debt sustainability threshold at 55% of GDP. The $250 million CARES Program will \nhave  only  a  small  impact,  adding  about  0.38%  to  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio,  which  remains \nsustainable.32  \n \nD. \n \n29. \nADB coordinates its COVID-19 response support closely with other development partners \nand the government\u2019s Development Aid Coordination Unit, chaired by the State Counsellor. The \nWHO  supported  the  formulation  of  the  HSCP  and  helped  coordinate  between  United  Nations \nagencies and nongovernment organizations. ADB is coordinating with the  IMF, which provided \nsupport through its Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument, and the World Bank to \nconduct  macroeconomic  monitoring  and  to  support  the  government\u2019s  economic  stimulus \nprograms. This coordination also extends to  assessing the impact of COVID-19 and designing \nthe  proposed  CARES  Program,  for  which  the  IMF  provided  an  assessment  letter. 33 ADB  is \nworking closely with Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the European Union, the IMF, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, and \nthe World Bank, and is exploring financing opportunities to help implement the CERP. \n \nE. \n \nThe  MOPFI  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  program.

It will enable ADB to \nsupport the government through technical assistance to ensure the effective implementation of \nthe CERP (footnote 26). The framework comprises a steering committee to guide and monitor the \noverall  implementation  of  the  CERP.  The  TWGs  will  support  the  committee  with  inputs  for \nmonitoring  the  government\u2019s  overall  COVID-19  response.  They  will  also  facilitate  the \ngovernment\u2019s  engagement  with  the  private  sector,  stakeholders,  and  other  ministries. \nGovernment representatives on the  TWGs will include officials from the  Ministry of Investment \nand Foreign Economic Relations, the MOPFI, and other ministries. The TWGs will meet at least \nonce every quarter. The program implementation period is from September 2020 to September \n2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic will have a devastating and long-term \nimpact  on  much  of  the  population,  particularly  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  Many \nhouseholds have experienced sharp declines in employment and income. Rural households are \nsuffering from a decline in remittances from migrant workers affected by the crisis both in-country \nand abroad. Poverty incidence  will worsen with 1.3 million people expected to  fall into poverty \n(para. 12). While the CERP lays out measures to  contain COVID-19, minimize socioeconomic \nimpacts, and help vulnerable groups, its adequate resourcing and effective implementation will \nbe critical to avert a sharp escalation in poverty and minimize short- and long-term social impacts.  \n \n33. \nGender. The CARES Program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will \naddress the gender-specific impacts of COVID-19 through three channels. First, the government \nwill  target  at  least  50%  female  beneficiaries  in  vulnerable  households  through  various  social \nassistance  programs. 36  Second,  the  MOHS  will  continue  to  mainstream  gender  into  health \nplanning and  service delivery by ensuring that communities have access to  gender-responsive \nCOVID-19 quarantine centers that are segregated, secure, and accessible for  all patients; and \nthat  health  care  workers  (65%  of  whom  are  women)  (i)  undergo  routine  testing  to  reduce \nasymptomatic transmission, and (ii) receive $35.80 in supplementary compensation. Finally, the \ngovernment  has  provided  working  capital  loans  and  tax  credits  to  MSMEs  (of  which  30%  are \nowned by women) to ensure access to credit during the recovery period. \n \n34. \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nprogram  is  not  expected  to  have  any  environmental  or  social  safeguard  impacts  within  the \nmeaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35. \nin Table 5 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37  \n\nRisks and mitigating measures.

It  will  ramp  up  public  health  capacity  by  improving \ntesting,  quarantine,  and  intensive  care  facilities,  and  medical \nstaffing. In addition, financial assistance packages such as working \ncapital loans and tax relief will improve the liquidity of MSMEs and \nworkers.  ADB  will  provide  support for  the  government to set  up  a \nnew  government  credit  guarantee  corporation,  with  due  regard  to \nbank credit risk practices and reporting. \n\nProlonged outbreak and resurgence of \nconfirmed cases deepen the economic \ndownturn. Myanmar has imposed several \nmovement restrictions, such as the \u201cstay at \nhome\u201d order, and curfews in Yangon and a \nfew other states and regions since 19 April \n2020. However, the unfolding health impact \nof COVID-19 may exacerbate the economic \ndownturn, affecting more vulnerable \nhouseholds and at-risk populations. \n\n \n\n35 ADB.  2014.

It reduced banks\u2019 deposit and lending \nrate ceilings by 3.0% and their minimum reserve requirement by at \nleast 150 basis points in March\u2013April 2020. The CBM allowed the \nbanks  to  restructure  and  reschedule  loans  already  extended  to \nMSMEs. It targets to conduct credit auctions, as necessary, to inject \nmore  liquidity  into  the finance  sector.  Before the  end  of  2020, the \ngovernment  plans  to  temporarily  reduce  treasury  bond  and  bill \nauctions to allow for an effective expansionary fiscal stance. \nThe government will convene quarterly meetings with development \npartners  and  stakeholders  to  monitor  the  CERP  implementation \nprogress.  The  technical  working  groups  will  be  tasked  to  engage \nwith  stakeholders  and  ensure  effective  and \ntransparent \nimplementation  of  CERP.  CERP  expenditures  will  be  published \nquarterly, and audited financial statements, within 6 months of each \nfiscal year. In addition, the government plans to unify the automated \nbudget  and  financial  reporting  systems,  which  will  be  critical  in \nenhancing  transparency  and  accuracy  of  financial  information  for \nmonitoring  and  reporting  on  the  CERP.

Adverse  impact  of \nexogenous shocks \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE  \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE OPTION \n \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nOn 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. As of 3 August 2020, \nthe  WHO  reported  17,396,943  million  confirmed  COVID-19  cases  and  675,060  deaths  from  COVID-19 \nglobally.a In Myanmar, 353 positive cases and 6 deaths have been reported as of 3 August 2020.   \n \nImpact on economic growth. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, GDP growth in FY2020 was projected at \n6.8%, sustained at the same level as in FY2019. The pre-outbreak outlook was attributable to robust growth \nin garment manufacturing and construction sectors, coupled with a recovery in the agriculture sector. ADB \nrevised GDP growth for FY2020 downward to 1.8%\u2014equivalent to economic losses of $3.3 billion\u2014with \ndownside  risks from possible  surges  in  infected cases.  This  compares  to 6.8% as  forecast  in 2019  and \n4.2% as projected in March 2020  \n \nImpact  on  key  economic  sectors.  There  are  three  main  transmission  mechanisms  through  which  the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  poses  short- \nlabor-intensive \nmanufactures have seen the biggest impact. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index sank to 29.0 \nin April 2020 from 45.3 in February 2020. This is the third straight month of contraction in the sector and \nthe steepest on record. Output, new orders, purchasing, and employment all contracted at record rates as \ndemand evaporated and workers returned to their hometowns. The garment manufacturing sector, which \nemploys around  1.1 million  workers nationwide  and  accounts  for 24.2%  of total exports  ($4.6 billion),  is \nparticularly  vulnerable  as  it  relies on  foreign markets  for  both  imported materials and  exports.  Of  those \nworkers in the garment manufacturing sector, 350,000 are at risk of either being suspended without pay or \nlosing  their  jobs  permanently.  Second,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  disrupted  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestment flows. From October 2019\ua7f7June 2020, the Myanmar Investment Commission had approved \n$4.4  billion  (MK6.1  trillion)  in  domestic  and  foreign  investments.  However,  total  new  investment \ncommitments in FY2020 will likely miss the target of $5.8 billion due to the sudden disruption  in trade and \nmanufacturing and construction delays arising out of the lockdowns and closures of non-essential business \nactivities.  Lastly,  the  tourism  sector,  which  accounts  for  6.8%  of  GDP  and  2.7%  of  total  employment \n(800,000 jobs), is expected to be hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Hotels and Tourism \nprojected international arrivals to fall to 2 million international travelers from the earlier estimate of more \nthan 4 million for 2020 due to international travel restrictions and trip cancellations. Even this projection is \nlikely to be highly optimistic. \n \n\nto  medium-term  economic  challenges.  First, \n\n \n\n\fCPRO Access Criteria \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n23 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nFinancial  sector  vulnerabilities.  The  banking  system  consists  of  27  private  banks,  of  which  6  are \nsystemic, 4 are state-owned banks, and 13 are foreign bank branches. The 6 systemic banks account for \n51%  of  system  assets  and  65%  of  total  system  lending.  Total  banking  system  assets  aggregate  to  \nMK63 trillion (approximately $42 billion) and represent approximately 60% of GDP. The banking sector has \nbeen characterized by structural  vulnerabilities prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, \nrisk remains high due to relatively low capital adequacy and bank profitability. In private banks, real estate \nand construction loans exceed aggregate capital, and commercial loans account for approximately 7-times \nthe aggregate equity capital. Yet capital buffers are thin. Aggregate banking sector Tier 1 regulatory capital \nis 10.8% of risk weighted assets. For FY2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Myanmar banking sector\u2019s \naggregate returns on assets and equity were among the lowest in the region. In recognition of all these \nchallenges, the banking sector has recently been under a modernization process. \n \nWidening fiscal deficit. The weakened economic environment and the required policy response to contain \nthe  pandemic  will  widen  the  fiscal  deficit.  The  necessary  additional  spending  on  health  and  targeted \ntransfers  to  vulnerable  households  and  firms  will  raise  expenditures,  while  weaker  economic  activity, \nreduced gas revenues, and targeted tax revenue relief will lower government revenue. The budget deficit \nis expected to widen significantly to 5.8% of GDP in FY2020, an increase from 2.6% prior to the COVID-19 \npandemic and 4.0% in FY 2019. In a scenario with widespread community transmission and even weaker \neconomic activity, even higher revenue losses and additional expenditures could further increase the deficit. \nDue to the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the government\u2019s development expenditure program, the total \nfinancing requirement is expected to increase by 13.0% from $3.7 billion to $4.18 billion in FY2020.  \n \nSocial  impact.    Despite  the  relatively  limited  outbreak  to  date,  COVID-19  has  already  caused  severe \ndeclines  in  employment  and  income  in  many  households.  For  example,  the  garment  sector  has  been \nparticularly hard-hit, resulting in significant layoffs. ADB estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic will result \nin 1.2 million\ua7f72.1 million jobs loss, equivalent to 5.1%\ua7f78.7% of total employment.b The employment impact \nof COVID-19 also exposed gender inequalities in the business sector. Women represent 60% of employees \nin  food  and  accommodation  services  and  70%\ua7f790%  for  street  food  vendors.  Women  also  constitute  a \nmajority of employees in the garment industry. This suggests that women are more  vulnerable to unpaid \nleave or unemployment. 83% of the country\u2019s 24 million workforce are in the informal sector, with more than \nhalf working in agriculture, small family business, or as own account workers (61.8% for working females \nand 54.1% for working males). Informal sector workers are typically not eligible for social protection benefits \nand  only  37%  of  workers  in  the  formal  sector  are  covered  by  the  social  health  protection  scheme.  It  is \nestimated that 4.25 million Myanmar nationals are working outside of the country. More than 0.9 million are \nmigrant workers, mainly from Mon State, Kayin State, and Shan State, who cross borders to work in the \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nPRC and Thailand. The official overseas employment constituted more than 50% of total job creation in \n2019, and remittances constituted 4.3% of GDP in 2019 and contributed, on average, 44% of household \nincome.  The  closing  of  businesses  in  the  neighboring  countries,  especially  the  PRC  and  Thailand,  has \nbrought  about  job  losses  among  migrant  workers.  As  of  12  June  2020,  103,163  migrant  workers  have \nreturned to Myanmar from Thailand, the PRC, and other countries.  \n \nCOVID-19 may slow Myanmar\u2019s significant progress in reducing poverty, with large poor and vulnerable \npopulations least able to cope with the impact of COVID-19. The most recent (2017) poverty headcount \nratio indicated that 19.3% of Myanmar\u2019s population lived under the $3.2 per day poverty line and projected \nthe ratio to decline to 11.5% in 2020 in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic.c ADB staff estimates that \nCOVID-19 is likely to increase the number of the poor from 6.3 million to 7.6 million people in 2020, and \nthat the projected poverty headcount ratio will increase from 11.5% to 13.9% in the same year. In addition, \nlarge  portions  of  the  population  (particularly  low-income  and  rural  households)  face  deprivations  and \nvulnerabilities in non-income dimensions such as access to employment opportunities, social protection, \nand  quality  health  care.  Finally,  only  17%  of  all  Myanmar  households  have  a  bank  account,  and  lower \nincome and rural households have particularly limited savings and access to formal financial institutions \n(e.g., 12.4% of poor households experienced health shocks in 2017 versus 10.6% for non-poor). In view of \nsuch  factors,  COVID-19  could  cause  major  and  far-reaching  social  impacts,  particularly  if  the  epidemic \nexpands and is prolonged.  \n \nHealth  impact.  As  of  3  August  2020,  Myanmar  had  officially  confirmed  353  cases  and  6  deaths  from \nCOVID-19. At the same time, approximately 20,000 people are quarantined in dedicated isolation facilities. \nAlthough confirmed cases have been reported from other states and regions as well, the epicenter of the \nCOVID-19 outbreak in Myanmar is the Yangon region, where 70.5% of all cases (249 out of 353) were \nrecorded.d  The country  has  implemented  intensified  public  health measures  such  as  closing  of borders, \nsuspension  of  visa,  travel  restrictions,  screening  incoming  travelers  at  all  points  of  entry,  quarantining \nindividuals with travel history to affected countries and contact history with confirmed cases, and isolating \nsuspected  cases  at  designated  hospitals.  Since  the  onset  of  the  outbreak,  the  government  has  set  up \ncommunity quarantine centers by repurposing public premises (7,772 as of 15 June 2020). The country\u2019s \ntesting capacity has been scaled up from 320 tests per day to 2,000 tests per day by June 2020. These \nmeasures, in theory, will help flatten the curve of the spread of the disease, so the health system can better \nmanage the outbreak.  \n \nMyanmar is at a high risk of significant COVID-19 impact despite officially reporting a moderate number of \nconfirmed cases. Notable vulnerabilities include: (i) a large influx of returning migrants from the PRC and \n\n\fCPRO Access Criteria \n\n2. Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nThailand, many of whom are crossing informal borders; (ii) high population density in urban and peri-urban \nareas  with  weak  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  IDP  camps  that  lack  basic  livelihood  and \nmedical care supplies and are prone to conflict situations. The HSCP for COVID-19 and other emerging \nrespiratory  diseases  projected  that,  if  widespread  community  transmission  of  COVID-19  occurred, \nMyanmar could have 356,821 total confirmed cases and nearly 75,000 active cases at the peak. This is \nbased on  the assumption  that mitigation  measures  are taken and  reduce  the  transmission  rate  by  two-\nthirds.  The  country\u2019s  healthcare  system  capacity  remains  one  of  the  weakest  in  the  region.  Myanmar \nalready faces a severe shortage of professional health staff, with only about 6.8 doctors (57% female) and \n10  registered  nurses  and  midwives  (96%  female)  per  10,000  population  in  2018.  The  country  has  0.9 \nhospital beds per 1,000 people, compared with 2.4 on average in lower-middle income countries, and has \nonly  about  200  equipped  and  functional  intensive  care  beds.  In  the  case  of  widespread  community \ntransmission, the healthcare system can be easily overwhelmed, resulting in a lack of access to services \nand a high mortality rate. Capacity to meet any surge in COVID-19 cases is urgently needed for surveillance \nand diagnosis, prevention and control, and case management. Existing and newly recruited health staff and \nvolunteers need rapid training on personal protection, field laboratory work, risk communication, and patient \nmanagement.  \nOn 27 April 2020, the government announced the CERP. The economic stimulus plan seeks to mitigate the \neconomic  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  while  establishing  foundations  to  facilitate  Myanmar\u2019s \neconomic recovery as part of a coordinated whole-of-nation response. The CERP comprises seven goals:  \n(i) improve the macroeconomic environment through monetary stimulus; (ii) ease the impact on the private \nsector by enabling investment, trade, and the banking sector; (iii) ease the impact on laborers and workers; \n(iv)  ease  the  impact  on  households;  (v)  promote  innovative  products  and  platforms;  (vi)  strengthen  the \nhealthcare system; and (vii) increase access to COVID-19 financing. The MOPFI estimated that around \n$2.5 billion in fiscal spending will be required. To finance the government\u2019s efforts to contain the COVID-19 \npandemic and stabilize the economy, the CERP aims to reallocate the budget in FY2020 to create fiscal \nspace for COVID-19-related responses and investment outlays. In addition, concessional financing will be \nraised \nIMF \nrecommendations. The proposed CARES Program, under the CPRO, will help the government fund and \nimplement the CERP. The government has consulted with development partners, including ADB, as well \nas private sector and stakeholders in formulating the CERP. ADB staff have applied a conflict sensitivity \napproach to ensure that the CERP has adequate provisions for supporting all ethnic groups living in different \nparts of the country without any differentiation. \n \nStrengthening  healthcare  system.  The  health  sector  response  is  guided  by  the  HSCP:  Outbreak \nResponse for COVID-19 and other Emerging Respiratory Disease in Myanmar. The CERP has incorporated \n\nthrough  development  partners  and \n\ninternational \n\ninstitutions, \n\nline  with \n\nfinancial \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nGoal 6 of this contingency plan: strengthening healthcare systems and  a strategy to promote healthcare \nthrough  increased  government  spending  and  regulatory  reform.  The  strategy  has  5  action  plans  and  \n16 actions, which are aligned with the HSCP, with emphasis on: (i) increasing the number and capacity of \nquarantine facilities by turning available public buildings into quarantine centers, recruiting medical staff and \nvolunteers  to  serve  in quarantine  facilities,  and ensuring  sufficient  supplies  of protective  equipment and \nmedical supplies; (ii) immediately procuring the required medical products for COVID-19 prevention, control, \nand treatment with an expedited procurement process; (iii) strengthening community preventive measures \nincluding  establishing  hand-washing  stations  at  convenient  and  accessible  locations,  deploying  mobile \ndisinfection teams to increase coverage of disinfection, deploying mobile teams for distribution of masks, \nand distributing information pamphlets to the public; and (iv) upgrading existing health facilities including \nlaboratories,  hospitals,  and  healthcare  centers  at  various  levels.e  The  country  had  only  one  national \nlaboratory  (BSL2)  for  COVID-19  testing  in  the  beginning  of  2020.  The  plan  is  to  establish  point-of-care \ntesting sites at state and regional levels and expanding COVID-19 testing capacity in the Mandalay Public \nHealth Laboratory  and  the  Department of  Medical  Research, Yangon.  The  total target  capacity  is 3,010 \ntests per day. The HSCP also includes upgrading and expanding ICU capacity at public hospitals (8 central \nlevel hospitals and 43 hospitals at the State and regional level), which will also be supported by a World \nBank project. The MOHS aims to increase the number of ICU beds from the current 200 beds to 500 beds. \nThese challenges have been complicated by a shortage in human resource and limited basic infrastructure \nsuch as unreliable electricity and water supply in many parts of the country.  \n \nSocial assistance provided to vulnerable groups and populations at risk.  The government\u2019s CERP \nhas established action plans to provide cash and in-kind transfers to vulnerable households and farmers. \nThe  government  will  also  exempt  public,  religious  organizations,  and  humanitarian  organizations  from \nelectricity  tariffs:  specifically,  the  government  allowed  an  exemption  of  up  to  150  kilowatt-hours  in \nApril\ua7f7June  and  up  to  75  kilowatt-hours  in  July  2020.  The  government  has  also  provided  in-kind  food \ntransfers to vulnerable households and at-risk populations, especially poor people without regular income. \nThe  General  Administration  Department  under  the  Ministry  of  the  Office  of  the  Union  Government  was \nmainly  responsible  for  the  dissemination  of  food  support.f  In  addition,  the  government  has  announced \nimplementation  of  cash  transfers  of  MK40,000  ($28.50)  per  household  to  about  5.5  million  vulnerable \nfamilies, especially those affected by the closure of factories and businesses or without regular income. \nThe  existing  social  assistance  programs  will  be  scaled  up.  The  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare,  Relief  and \nResettlement will expand the MCCT Program nationwide, which aims to improve nutritional outcomes for \nmothers and children during the critical first 1,000 days of life. The MCCT Program has been ongoing in \nChin State since 2017 and was subsequently expanded to Rakhine State and Naga Self-Administered Zone \nof the Sagaing Region in 2018.g Under the MCCT Program, each pregnant woman and under 2-year old \n\n\fCPRO Access Criteria \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nchild  will  be  provided  MK30,000  ($21.50)  as  one-time  payment.  In  addition  to  the  MCCT  Program,  the \ngovernment  will  provide  one-time  payment  of:  (i)  MK30,000  ($21.50)  to  each  elderly  person  between  \n80\u201384 years old, on top of the regular social pension for elderly persons who are at least 85 years old; and  \n(ii) MK20,000 ($14.30) to disabled people as one-time allowance. To strengthen agriculture value chains \nand promote income generation and retention,  the MOALI will also support farmers, seed farmers, small \nagri-processors, and agri-businesses. To support input purchases in time for monsoon planting by the end \nof  2020,  MOALI  plans  to  provide  cash  or  lending  support  to  smallholder  farmers  who  have  lost  sales \nrevenue or remittance income. MOALI also committed to offer complementary support by the end of 2020, \nproviding advice to enhance productivity and market connectivity.  \n \nProviding working capital for MSMEs. The government had established a MK100 billion ($71.7 million) \nCOVID-19 Fund comprised of MK50 billion drawn from State\u2019s Revolving Fund and MK50 billion from the \nSocial Security Fund, to provide low interest working capital to the most affected industries such as cutting, \nmaking, and processing enterprises, MSMEs, and hotel and tourism businesses. The interest rate is 1% for \na period of 1  year.  Working capital has been  provided  to  the enterprises  which meet  the  pre-structured \ncriteria  established  by  the  government.h  Loans  have  been  provided  to  nearly  3,000  MSMEs  totaling  \n$65 million as of June 2020. The government plans to increase fund size by MK200 billion\ua7f7MK500 billion \n($143.4 million\ua7f7$358.4 million), depending on the evolving needs from MSMEs. Also, the government plans \nto  expand  existing  pilot  commercial  lending  programs  to  those  townships  that  are  most  economically \naffected. The government has also arranged to offer credit guarantee schemes by the end of 2020, with the \nsupport of ADB. Through the credit guarantee scheme, the government will provide guarantees covering \n50% of any new loans made by banks to Myanmar enterprises up to a turnover of MK1 billion ($720,000) \nfor working capital, as long as the enterprises are not beneficiaries of the COVID-19 Fund and conditional \nupon  maintenance  or  rehire  of  staff  employed  as  of  1  February  2020.  Moreover,  the  government  has \ncommitted  to  promote  trade  financing  for  designated  commercial  banks  through  the  establishment  of  a \nMK100 billion ($71.7 million) fund before the end of 2020. \n \nSocial  protection  and  reemployment  of  workers.  The  government  extended  healthcare  benefits  to \nunemployed SSB members from 6 months to 1 year from the date of unemployment, with medicine benefits. \nThe Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement allowed employers to defer their employees\u2019 SSB \ncontributions for 3 months. Under the CERP, the government has committed to implement labor-intensive \ncommunity  infrastructure  before  the  end  of  2020  to  ease  unemployment  triggered  by  the  COVID-19 \noutbreak.  With ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  under  the  Resilient  Community  Development Project,  the CERP \nincludes  action  plans  for  extending  labor  benefits  and  for  implementation  of  labor-intensive  community \ninfrastructure for the purpose of easing the impact on laborers. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n\n3. Pre-shock record \nof generally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\n \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nTax  relief  and  tax  payment  deferral  to  increase  liquidity  among  businesses  and  individuals.  The \ngovernment has deferred the payment of corporate income tax (Q2 payments expiring on 31 March and Q3 \npayments expiring on 30 June) and commercial tax (payable every 3 months) up to 30 September 2020. \nThe government waived the 2% withholding tax on exports and goods tax, customs duties, and commercial \ntaxes on critical medical supplies and products related to the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-\n19. Moreover, the government expects to provide a 10% nonrefundable tax credit on incremental wage bills \nand incremental investments in capital equipment. A tax deduction equal to 125% of wages paid and 125% \nof capital depreciation will be provided to increase liquidity among MSMEs. The government estimates that \ntax revenues will decrease from 5.7% of GDP prior to COVID-19 to 4.2% of GDP in FY2020. However, \nactual tax revenues may be even lower than this primary estimation due to the economic impacts of COVID-\n19 and tax reliefs measures for COVID-19 response. \n \nMonetary  policy and  banking sector  measures.  The  government  has  initiated monetary and  banking \nsector stimulus measures in the run-up to launching the CERP. The CBM reduced the minimum reserve \nrequirement on banks by 150 basis points to better align with market conditions. The CBM allowed banks \nto restructure and reschedule existing loans extended to MSMEs that regularly pay interest and principal \non a timely basis for a period no longer than 3 years. The CBM will conduct credit auctions as necessary \nto inject more liquidity into the banking and financial sector. It has also arranged to negotiate with private \nfinancial institutions to give more flexibility related to interest and mortgage payments for households that \nare most negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the government will allow  the CBM to \nfinance the fiscal deficit as necessary, up to a suitable level consistent with its target for growth in the money \nsupply.  \nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, GDP growth was expected to pick up to 6.8% in 2020 from the average \nof 6.4% in 2015\ua7f72019, with stable inflation rate of 7.1% on average. Robust economic growth has been \nsupported  by  two  key  sectors:  industry  and  services.  Industry  grew  by  8.4%  in  2019  as  garment \nmanufacturing  and  construction  expanded,  while  services  saw  moderate  growth  of  8.3%  in  2019.  The \npickup in GDP growth in the run-up to the outbreak was accompanied by an increase in the inflation rate \nfrom 5.9% in 2018 to 8.6% in 2019 as prices for food and imported fuel rose. \n \nThe external position is broadly in line with economic fundamentals. The current account deficits were \nmodest at an average of 4.3% of GDP in 2015\ua7f72019 due to lower FDI-related imports, including a decline \nin  iron  and  steel  imports  due  to  a  slowdown  in  construction  and  one-off  factors  related  to  changes  in \nautomobile import regulations. In contrast, the exports held up, led by garment manufacturing and natural \ngas, amid global trade tensions, and the economic slowdown in the PRC. The narrower deficit offset weaker \nFDI and other inflows. This allowed a modest buildup of foreign exchange reserves via auctions to about \n$6.0 billion in April 2020, equivalent to 5 months of imports coverage. \n\n\fCPRO Access Criteria \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nFiscal policy was moderately accommodative with improved budget execution and PFM. In the run-\nup to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit was estimated at 2.6% of GDP in FY2020, narrowed slightly \nfrom 4.0% in FY2019, and was considered an appropriate fiscal policy stance. Improved budget execution \nand debt  issuances  had  allowed  the prospect of phasing out  CBM\u2019s  debt monetization by  FY2021.  The \ndeclining  trend  in  the  revenue-to-GDP  ratio  from  18.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2018  to  around  18.0%  in \nFY2019\ua7f7FY2020  needs  to  be  reversed,  and  a  medium-term  revenue  strategy  with  specific  targets  is \nneeded  to meet  SDG-related  spending needs under  the  Myanmar  Sustainable  Development Plan.  This \nwould involve modernizing the tax system to raise revenues while improving PFM systems for more efficient \nand responsive fiscal spending. The government has taken several actions to improve procurement and \nbudget disbursement for the COVID-19 responses. For example, the MOHS has enhanced procurement of \nthe  required  medical  products  for  COVID-19  prevention,  control,  and  treatment  with  an  expedited \nprocurement process. The MOPFI has waived customs duties and commercial tax related to the importation \nof critical medical supplies and products related to the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19. The \nMOPFI has introduced the automated financial information reporting system for the Treasury (FIRST). To \nimprove PFM systems, the MOPFI will move to the second phase of automation to unify budget and financial \nreporting.  The  development of  a  unified chart of accounts  would also  support  the  automation  and  close \ngaps  with  international  reporting  standards.  The  modernization  of  the  PFM  law,  building  on  preliminary \nfindings  of  the  PEFA,  has  made  significant  efforts  to  improve  governance  and  transparency  and  fight \ncorruption through wide-ranging economic, social, institutional, and governance reforms and would support \nthe  PFM  reform  process  over  the  medium-term.  ADB  support  will  continue  to  be  provided  to  improve \nfinancial management capacity of the OAGM. ADB has helped develop the financial audit guidelines aligned \nwith International Standard for Supreme Audit Institution and  will continue  to provide support to improve \nfinancial management capacity of the OAGM, especially for financial audit, governance, and transparency \nof COVID-19-related public expenditures. \n \nBroad monetary aggregates and the exchange rate remained stable. Reserve money growth picked \nup at the end of FY2019 due to increased monetary financing but remained within target as net foreign \nassets remained broadly stable. Moreover, growth in broad money aggregates, the intermediate objective, \nmoderated from 19.0%  in  FY2018  to 15.5%  in  FY2019 as  targeted.  Treasury and  deposit auction  rates \nhave also remained relatively stable as excess reserves of the banking system were seasonally low and \nreserve money growth has moderated to about 6% year-on-year since September 2019. The nominal and \nreal  effective  exchange  rates  have  been  broadly  stable  since  the  CBM  formally  adopted  a  market-\ndetermined reference exchange rate. The move has better anchored market expectations and reduced the \ninformal market spread with limited one-way foreign exchange intervention. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nCPRO Access Criteria \n4. Structural reforms \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nThe  government  has  formed  the  National  Central  Committee  for  COVID-19  Prevention,  Control  and \nTreatment chaired by the State Counsellor, to coordinate and monitor the overall COVID-19 responses. \nThe COVID-19 Containment and Emergency Response Committee chaired by Myanmar\u2019s Vice President \n1 has also been established and tasked to oversee health responses, including those in the CERP. The \nMOHS has announced the HSCP, estimated to cost $300 million, covering two phases: the immediate to \nshort-term (April 2020\ua7f7December 2021) and the short- to medium-term (January 2022\ua7f7December 2024). \nDuring  the  immediate  and  short-term,  the  focus  is  on  community  surveillance,  active  case  detection, \nquarantine measures, risk communication and community engagement, non-pharmaceutical interventions, \nstrengthening laboratory supplies, protection of healthcare workers, and improving clinical capacity. Over \nthe short- to medium-term, the focus will be on strengthening the resilience of the health system and its \npreparedness  for  future  outbreaks  and  other  emergencies  (see  Criteria  2  above  on  countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditures). \n \nIn early May 2020, the government announced the COVID-19 National Response and Recovery Plan for \nthe Education Sector (May 2020\u2013October 2021). The plan includes two phases: phase 1 or response phase \n(May  2020\u2013September  2020)  and  phase  2  or  recovery  phase  through  the  reopening  of  education \ninstitutions (October 2020\u2013October 2021). The holistic plan covers all states and regions in Myanmar and \nall education subsectors under the Ministry of Education. The plan includes a framework of strategies and \ninterventions  for  (i)  ensuring  continuity  of  education  for  all  learners  in  Myanmar,  (ii)  ensuring  that  the \nreopening  of  education  institutions  is  planned  properly,  and  (iii)  contributing  to  safer  and  more  resilient \neducation environments. \n\n5. Debt sustainability  The  IMF\u2019s  Staff  Report  for  the  2019  Article  IV  Consultation  noted  that  Myanmar\u2019s  risks  of  external  and \noverall debt distress continue to be assessed as low. Myanmar\u2019s total public debt is estimated to be 39.5% \nof GDP as of FY2019. Public domestic debt accounted for 62.5% of total public debt in FY2019 and external \npublic debt stood at 37.5% of total public debt in FY2019. Domestic debt comprises treasury bills and bonds, \na  large  share  of  which\u2014mostly  3-month  treasury  bills\u2014is  held  by  the  CBM.  The  largest  share  of  PPG \nexternal debt is held by bilateral creditors, amongst which the PRC and Japan are the largest creditors. The \nInternational Development Association and ADB are the largest multilateral creditors. Gross official reserves \nstood at $6.0 billion (5 months of imports equivalence) in April 2020, up from $5.7 billion in FY2019. \n \nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the public debt to GDP ratio was expected to decline from 39.5% in FY2019 \nto 36.9% in FY2020 and edge up to 37.2% in FY2021. COVID-19 will affect the public debt to GDP ratio by \n(i)  increasing  public  debt  levels  as  the  result  of  higher  budget  deficit,  and  (ii)  contracting  GDP.  ADB \nestimates that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the public debt to GDP ratio from 39.5% in FY2019 to \n43.6% in FY2020 and 45.2% in FY2021\u2014still well below IMF\u2019s debt sustainability threshold of 55%.

Coordination with \nInternational \nMonetary Fund \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nCARES  Program  under  the  CPRO  ($250  million)  is  estimated  to  generate  only  a  small  impact,  adding \naround  0.38%  to  the  public  debt  to  GDP  ratio.  Therefore,  the  existing  debt  ratio  and  projected  public \nindebtedness, including the potential impact of the proposed CPRO borrowing, are sustainable. \nADB  is  closely  coordinating  with the  IMF  on macroeconomic monitoring and  is assessing  the  impact of \nCOVID-19 on the economy and government finances of Myanmar. The government and the IMF have an \nagreement in place for budget support using the Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument worth \nup to $700 million in response to the pandemic. The first tranche of $356.5 million was approved by the \nIMF\u2019s  Board  on  26  June  2020  and disbursed  on  2  July 2020.  The  IMF\u2019s  Board  will  consider  a planned \nsecond tranche of about $350 million by December 2020. ADB has been in close contact with the IMF on \nthe  proposed  CARES  Program.  The  government  is  also  requesting  financial  assistance  from  other \ndevelopment  partners  and  ADB  is  closely  coordinating,  and  exploring  parallel  opportunities,  with  other \ndevelopment partners such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the European Union, and the \nWorld Bank. The IMF has provided an assessment letter (circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 16 June \n2020)  confirming that the fiscal  stimulus  under  the  CERP  will be  instrumental  in  containing  the  adverse \nhealth, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support, CBM = Central Bank of Myanmar, CERP = COVID-19 Economic \nRelief  Plan,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  CPRO  =  COVID-19  pandemic  response  option,  FDI  =  foreign  direct  investment,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  GDP  =  gross \ndomestic product, HSCP = Health Sector Contingency Plan, ICU = intensive care unit, IDP = internally displaced person, IMF = International Monetary Fund, MCCT \n= Maternal and Child Cash Transfer, MK = Myanmar kyat, MOALI = Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, MOHS = Ministry of Health and Sports, MOPFI \n= Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry, MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, OAGM = Office of the Auditor General of the Union of Myanmar, \nPEFA = Public expenditure and Financial Accountability, PFM = public financial management, PPG = public and publicly guaranteed, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Q = quarter, SDG = Sustainable Development Goals, SSB = Social Security Board, WHO = World Health Organization. \na  WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. \nb  ADB. 2020.
