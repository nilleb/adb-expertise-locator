The  Indian  finance  sector  is  still  developing,  with  banks \ndominating  the  sector.  At  the  end  of  FY2016,  the  sector  comprised  216  banks,  including \n149 scheduled  commercial  banks.  The  total  deposits  of  all  banks  stood  at  Rs99.3  trillion  and \ntotal  loans  outstanding  amounted  to  Rs77.2  trillion. 1  In  addition,  11,682 nonbank  financial \ncompanies  were  registered  with  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI),  with  estimated  total  loans \noutstanding of Rs13.0 trillion.2 Notwithstanding the size of the finance sector and the significant \nstrides  the  government  is  making  in  this  sector,  including  the  successful  Pradhan  Mantri  Jan \nDhan  Yojana  scheme  (Prime  Minister\u2019s  People  Money  Scheme),3 access  to  finance  in  India \nremains a key issue. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking subsector (according \nto  the  RBI\u2019s  definition)  worsened  from  4.6%  in  FY2015  to  7.6%  in  FY2016.  The  capital \nadequacy  ratio  (CAR)  of  the  banking  subsector  has  decreased  slightly  in  recent  years,  from \n14.0% in FY2013 to 13.2% in FY2016. \n \n3. \nMicrofinance  industry.  At  the  end  of  FY2016,  the  Indian  microfinance  industry  had \nprovided microcredit to 33.2 million customers through 9,736 branches, disbursing 34.7 million \nloans  amounting  to  Rs670  billion,  with  an  average  loan  size  of  $265. 4  The  number  of \ndisbursements  grew  78.2%  in  FY2016,  while  aggregate  gross  loan  portfolio  grew  by  91.0% \nduring the same period. Since FY2013, the industry has seen a compound annual growth rate \nof  88.6%  in  disbursements  and  a  93.7%  compound  annual  growth  rate  in  the  gross  loan \nportfolio.5 CRISIL  Research,  a  ratings  agency,  expects  the  aggregate  microfinance  institution \n(MFI)  loan  portfolio  to  grow  by  30%\u201334%  annually  until  the  end  of  FY2021.  Problem  loans \namong  MFIs  have  seen  a  steadily  decreasing  trend,  falling  from  0.5%  in  FY2013  to  0.3%  in \nFY2016 for 30 days past due.  \n\n \n\n4. \nThe  Government  of  India  continues  to  support  the  microfinance  industry  and  has \nencouraged  banks  to  provide  further  support  for  micro  and  small  enterprise  (MSE)  financing. \nThe RBI\u2019s 2013 circular defines MSEs as manufacturing or service businesses subject to certain \nsizes of investment or machinery amounts.6 MSEs are eligible for priority sector lending (PSL)\u2014\nan RBI requirement to support financial inclusion that obliges commercial banks to lend at least \n40%  of  their  adjusted  net  bank  credit  of  the  previous  year  to  specified  priority  sectors,  with  a \nfocus  on  underserved  and  rural  borrowers.7 Given  the  operational  difficulties  of  reaching  this \n                                                \n1   Reserve Bank of India, 2016.

Policy makers in India \n5. \nknow  the  ramifications  of  leaving  a  large  section  of  the  population  out  of  the  development \nprocess.  Therefore,  they  are  designing  policies  for  financial  inclusion  that  will  increase  the \navailability  of  financial  services  to  the  poor  and  marginalized  segments  of  society,  and  have \nbeen encouraging banks to prepare a road map to cover all unbanked villages with populations \nof less than 2,000. To achieve sustainable rural operations, banks are considering alternate low-\ncost  channels  for  delivery  of  banking  services.  The  RBI  has  encouraged  them  to  improve  the \noutreach  of  banking  services  through  the  business  facilitator  and  business  correspondent \nmodels.  The  recommendations  of  the  Nachiket  Mor  Committee  also  include  accelerating  the \nflow of credit to the poor and enlarging business correspondents\u2019 catchment areas, including the \nuse of new entities as business correspondents.8  \n \nThe RBI has collated best practices with respect to business correspondent lending and \n6. \nissued guidelines to commercial banks on the use of the business correspondent lending model, \nincluding  cash  management  practices. 9 A  business  correspondent  can  help  banks  mobilize \ndeposits and drive credit penetration in rural and semi-urban areas. A business correspondent \ncan  be  an  individual  (such  as  a  grocery  store  owner),  MFI,  or  agent  of  a  corporate  business \ncorrespondent.10 The  transaction  cost  for  a  business  correspondent  is  estimated  to  be  1/15th \nthe  transaction  cost  in  a  rural  branch.11 The  lower  costs  are  primarily  enabled  by  technology, \nwhich  allows  real-time  transactions.  To  increase  the  profitability  of  rural  operations,  banks  are \nexpected  to  expand  their  reliance  on  this  model.  CRISIL  Research  estimates  that  8%\u201312%  of \nrural transactions are done through business correspondents, and this is projected to increase \nto 25%\u201330% by 2018\u20132019 (footnote 11). \n \nInvestment rationale. Given the continued need to address access to finance issues for \n7. \nmany  customer  segments  in India,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  sought  to  identify \nfinancial institution partners that have demonstrated the ability to reach underbanked segments \nwhile maintaining profitability and good asset quality. In 2014, ADB approved a project with two \nprivate banks in India to address access to funding gaps for agri-lending.12 In 2015, it approved \na  project  with  another  private  bank  to  support  financial  inclusion  in  India. 13  In  2016,  ADB \napproved  a  project  to  support  microfinance  lending  to  women  borrowers  and  sanitation \nfinancing.14 To build on ADB\u2019s initiatives to promote financial inclusion in India, ADB met with a \nnumber of private banks that are reaching underbanked segments and seeking to expand their \noperations  in this  area. IndusInd  Bank  Limited (IndusInd)  is  ADB\u2019s  partner  as  a  local  currency \n\n                                                \n8   RBI. 2013.

In  FY2016,  IndusInd\u2019s  priority  sector \nadvances  reached  out  to  more  than  2  million  poor  households,  including  almost  1.5  million \nagriculturalists, across 25 states and 395 districts. About 40% of the loans were for agriculture \nand  animal  husbandry  (covering  such  areas  as  vegetable  cultivation,  borewell  digging,  pump \nsets,  livestock  loans  for  buffalo,  cow  and  sheep  rearing,  and  kitchen  poultry  units);  and  the \nbalance  was  for  other  microenterprises  (including  saree  trading,  street  vendors,  milk  vendors, \nfruit  and  vegetable  businesses,  cycle  repair  shops,  weavers,  bangle  vendors,  tea  stalls,  and \ntailoring). These types  of microenterprise  activities are  also the  subject of  IndusInd\u2019s business \ncorrespondent model lending.     \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n8. \nADB\u2019s  funding  will  help  support  IndusInd\u2019s  financial  inclusion  program,  enabling  it  to \nreach  a  wider  geographic  segment  of  the  underbanked  and  unbanked.  IndusInd  has  a  strong \nand  expanding  footprint  in  underserved  regions  of  India,  and  focuses  on  maximizing \ndevelopment  impact  by  reaching  a  large  number  of  women  borrowers  to  whom  ADB  cannot \nlend  directly.  This  shows  clear  alignment  with  ADB\u2019s  development  objectives.  IndusInd  has \nbeen identified as an excellent partner for a direct ADB funding initiative as it provides a unique \nopportunity  to  expand  work  with  a  bank  that  has  a  strong  ongoing  commitment  to  inclusive \nfinance, having built it profitably as a core business.16  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nIndusInd  is  a  private  sector  bank  in India  that  was  incorporated  in  1994.  It  offers  a  full \nrange of banking services and is the fifth-largest private sector bank in India by total assets and \n33rd largest bank overall. The bank operates across four divisions: (i) corporate and commercial \nbanking, (ii) consumer banking, (iii) global markets group, (iv) and transaction banking. It has a \ndiversified loan book and services the spectrum of customers including individuals; micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and corporate groups. IndusInd has a strong deposit \nfranchise, mobilizing customer deposits through 1,000 branches and 1,800 ATMs spread across \nthe  country.  It  has  a  long-term  debt  rating  of  AA+  from  ICRA  (Moody\u2019s),  India  Ratings  and \nResearch (Fitch), and CARE Ratings. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nOwnership.  Integrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nIntegrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  for  Nonsovereign  Operations.  No  significant  or  potentially \nsignificant  integrity  issues  were  identified.  IndusInd  is  promoted  by  IndusInd  International \nHoldings  Limited  and  its  subsidiary  Indusind  Limited.  Both  are  entities  established  by  non-\nresident  Indians  led  by  S.  P.  Hinduja.  IndusInd  International  Holdings  Limited  and  IndusInd \nLimited collectively hold 16.7% of all shares and is the largest shareholding group. IndusInd is \nlisted on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.  \n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Microfinance Risk \n\nParticipation Program. Manila.  \n\n16 IndusInd has won several awards and has been recognized internationally for its inclusive financing and corporate \nsocial  responsibility  (CSR)  practices.  These  awards  include  the  Best  Financial  Inclusion  Initiative  at  the  India \nBanking Association Awards in 2016, the Best Rural Outreach Award at the Sustainability Leadership Awards 2014 \nin  Dubai,  Top  CSR  Advocates  in  Asia  at  the  Asia  Corporate  Excellence  and  Sustainability  Awards  2014  in \nSingapore,  and  the  Financial  Inclusion  and  Payment  Systems  Award  2014  for  the  bank\u2019s  partnership  program \nunder its business correspondent model.  \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n11.  Management.  IndusInd\u2019s  senior  management  team  has  full  executive  powers  and  is \nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  bank.  It  includes  an  experienced  team  of \nprofessionals, led by Romesh Sobti who has 34 years of banking experience, having worked at \nABN Amro and ANZ Grindlays, and consists of 12 other senior managers who head individual \nbusiness lines and associated support functions, as well as an independent risk function. \n \n12. \nGovernance  structure.  As  a  listed  company,  IndusInd  must  comply  with  the \ngovernance  requirements  of  the  exchanges  on  which  it  is  listed.  The  bank  is  supervised  by  a \nboard of directors consisting of nine members, with board membership approved by the RBI. Of \nthe nine board members, six are considered independent under Indian law.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \nCapital.  IndusInd  has  a  CAR  under  Basel  III  guidelines  of  15.5%  and  Tier  1  CAR  of \n14.9% at the end of FY2016. This compares with a CAR of 12.1% and Tier 1 CAR of 11.2% at \nthe end of FY2015. The bank has a demonstrated record of mobilizing equity capital at regular \nintervals  to  support  its  growth.  Total  capital  at  the  end  of  FY2016  was  Rs180 billion,  against \nRs107 billion in FY2015. In July 2015, the bank raised Rs43.3 billion through the placement of \nshares with institutional investors, as well as Rs7.5 billion from the promoters to enable them to \nretain their 16.7% stake.  \n \n14. \nLoan  portfolio.  At the end of FY2016, IndusInd had total assets of Rs1,400 billion and \nthe  loan  portfolio  reached  Rs884  billion.  This  represented  loan  growth  of  29%  during  FY2016 \n(against  25%  in  FY2015).  The  bank\u2019s  loan  portfolio  in  FY2016  was  split  59:41  between \ncorporate banking and consumer finance (59:41 in FY2015).   \n \n15. \nAsset quality. IndusInd\u2019s asset quality is sound, with a gross NPA ratio of 0.87% under \nRBI guidelines at the end of FY2016. This was a slight increase from the FY2015 level of 0.81%. \nThe  asset  quality  of  the  bank  has  remained  stable  in  recent  years,  although  gross  NPAs \nincreased  slightly  during  FY2014  in  line  with  industry  trends  as  a  result  of  slippages  in  the \ncommercial  vehicle  segment.  This  has  since  stabilized  as growth  has  slowed  in  this  segment. \nNPAs across other portfolio segments have been decreasing. The bank\u2019s very limited exposure \nto  stressed  sectors  such  as  infrastructure,  power,  iron  and  steel,  and  textiles  has  helped  its \nasset quality. Net NPAs were a low 0.36% at the end of FY2016 (0.31% in FY2015).  \n  \n16. \nEarnings.  The  bank  has  continued  to  increase  profitability  since  2010,  returning  net \nprofit  after  tax  of  Rs22.9  billion  in  FY2016,  a  27%  increase  over  FY2015  net  profit  of  Rs17.9 \nbillion; (FY2014: Rs14.1 billion). This resulted in sound profitability metrics for FY2016\u2014a return \non  assets  of  1.9%  and  return  on  average  equity  of  16.8% (FY2015:  return  on  assets  of  1.9%; \nreturn on  average  equity  of  18.6%). The  decrease in return  on average  equity  was  due  to the \nsignificant capital raised during FY2016.  \n \n17. \nFunding.  IndusInd\u2019s  liability  funding  is  diversified,  with  deposits  to  total  liability  funding \nstanding  at  76%  at  the  end  of  FY2016.  The  remaining  funding  consists  of  a  mix  of  domestic \nbank and institutional borrowings and subordinated debt, the majority of which has a maturity of \nless  than  3  years.  The  bank  has  seen  steady  improvement  in  its  deposit  base  following  a \nstrategy  of  new  product  launches  and  expanding  its  branch  network.  This  contributed  to  the \n25% increase in deposits during FY2016.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide a senior loan of up to $200 million for up to 7 years to IndusInd to help \n18. \nsupport  its  microfinance  activities  under  its  business  correspondent  model.  The  objective  is  to \ndrive  financial  inclusion 17 by  providing  credit  to  significantly  underserved  market  segments, \npredominantly  women  in  rural  areas  of  India\u2019s  less-developed  states.  ADB  also  expects  to \nprovide capacity building technical assistance (TA) in an amount of up to $1 million, which will \naccompany  the  ADB  funding  and  will  target  financial  inclusion  initiatives  that  IndusInd  is \nimplementing or developing. This includes financial and legal literacy programs for women, and \ndigitized processing and product development initiatives.18 \n \nB. \n \n19. \nADB  will  carry  out  project  monitoring.  IndusInd  will  provide  ADB  with  reports  at \npredetermined regular intervals including (i) unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis; \n(ii)  audited  financial  statements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial \ncovenants;  (iv)  reporting  on  the  inclusive  finance  and  business  correspondent  loan  portfolio; \n(v) reporting on selected development indicators agreed between ADB and  IndusInd, including \nthe gender action plan; and (vi) compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nC. \n \nSupport  to  financial  inclusion.  ADB\u2019s  funding  will  help  IndusInd  to  grow  and  reach \n20. \nsignificantly  underserved  customer  segments  in India.  Additional funding will  enable  it  to meet \nand exceed PSL targets\u2014a key government objective. By  providing long-term funding support \nto a leading private bank focused on financial inclusion, ADB has the opportunity to support PSL \ninitiatives and promote financial inclusion to women in less developed areas in India.  \n \n21. \nAccess  to  long-term  funding. Banks in India largely lend from short-term, less stable \ndeposits because of difficulties in sourcing sufficient long-term financing.
