THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed debt \ninvestment in bonds of up to B3,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in United States dollars) out of a \ntotal issuance of B10 billion to be issued by Energy Absolute Public Company Limited (Energy \nAbsolute) for the Energy Absolute Green Bond for Wind Power Project in Thailand. \n \n2.  The project entails the issuance of green bonds to support the long-term financing of \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s 260-megawatt (MW) Hanuman wind farm in Thailand through refinancing of \nshort-term supplier credit that was used to help complete construction of the project. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will subscribe to the bonds and provide assistance to Energy Absolute \nto ensure that the bonds are recognized as certified climate bonds under the Climate Bonds \nStandard (CBS) of the Climate Bonds Initiative. The bonds will also comply with the International \nCapital Markets Association's Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations Green Bond Standards (ASEAN GBS). ADB\u2019s participation is crucial for CBS \ncertification of the entire bond issuance, and the project will contribute to the development of the \ngreen bond market in Thailand and the region. It will be only the third CBS-certified climate bond \nissuance in Thailand and only the second by a Thai energy company. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. The finance sector worldwide is beginning to respond to climate \nchange and attempts to mainstream climate mitigation and adaptation into investment decisions. \nInstitutional investors and banks have increasingly begun to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d1 their portfolios and \nincrease \u201cgreen\u201d2 investments, such as in renewable energy and other areas that contribute to \nclimate mitigation and adaptation. This demand has led to a requirement for credible frameworks \nto verify what qualifies as a green investment. Investors need to assure their clients and other \nstakeholders that they are using frameworks that are consistent with delivering science-based \ntargets for a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. This assurance and transparency are \nequally important for project developers and other issuers, because companies and projects with \nsignificant greenhouse gas emissions can be penalized in the capital markets, whereas climate-\nfriendly investments may attract new investors and benefit from more favorable financing terms. \n \n4.  Green bonds are innovative financial instruments to promote such efforts, whereby the \nproceeds are used exclusively to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new or existing projects \nwith environmental or climate-related benefits. Green bonds provide a mechanism for financing \ninvestments in green and climate-smart projects that are aligned with the Paris Agreement on \nclimate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The \n\u201clabeled\u201d3 green bond market is growing rapidly and reached an annual issuance amount of \n$167.6 billion in 2018 globally, from just $0.5 billion in 2008. Cumulative issuance since the first \ngreen bond was issued in 2007 is estimated at $512 billion.4 The GBP and CBS are the two most \n \n1  \u201cDecarbonize\u201d refers to the process of reducing the proportion of investments in greenhouse-gas-intensive sectors, \ntechnologies, and projects\u2014and correspondingly increasing the proportion of investments in low- or zero-emission \nsectors, technologies, and projects\u2014for a particular investment portfolio or company. \n2  \u201cGreen\u201d investments are those with clear environmental benefits. \n3  \u201cLabeled\u201d green bonds are bonds that are labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d by the issuer because the proceeds are earmarked \nsolely for \u201cgreen\u201d assets. \n4  Climate Bonds Initiative. 2019. Green bonds: The state of the market 2018. London. \n ", "2   \nwidely recognized standards for green bonds based on international best practice.5 Regionally, \nADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department provided technical assistance to help the ASEAN Capital \nMarkets Forum establish the ASEAN GBS, a standard based on the GBP. The project will \ndemonstrate the application of the ASEAN GBS and support an important \u201cOne ADB\u201d initiative \naimed at greening the regional capital markets.6  \n \n5.  Against this backdrop of huge untapped markets and opportunities for ADB, green bond \nissuance in ASEAN economies is expected to accelerate. Thailand, in particular, has great \npotential for an active green bond market because it has significant renewable energy resources \nand its bond market is the largest among ASEAN bond markets. The Thai bond market's annual \nissuance of long-term corporate bonds reached a new high of B879 billion in 2018.7 While \nThailand\u2019s energy production still depends heavily on fossil fuels and renewable energy sources \nare currently contributing only 10%, this is projected to increase to 15%\u201320% by 2036 under \nThailand\u2019s Power Development Plan, 2018\u20132037.8 To date, renewable energy projects have been \nfinanced mainly by banks. Notwithstanding its growing needs and huge potential, the country\u2019s \nfirst green bond complying with GBP was only issued in June 2018 by a local bank. \n \n6.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7.  Project description. The project involves a cornerstone investment of up to B3 billion into \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond issuance. Energy Absolute is aiming to raise a total of B10 \nbillion through bond issues with tenors of 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. ADB will invest in the 7-year \ntranche but will facilitate CBS certification of the entire B10 billion bond issuance. Bond proceeds \nwill be used to support the long-term financing of the 260 MW Hanuman wind farm in Chaiyaphum \nProvince, Thailand. Hanuman is Thailand\u2019s biggest wind farm and reached its commercial \noperation date in April 2019. It has a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with the \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Hanuman will result in annual emission \nreductions of about 200,000 tons of carbon dioxide by 2020. \n \n8.  This will be the second GBP- and CBS-compliant green bond issuance by an energy \ncompany in Thailand and only the third CBS-compliant green bond issuance in Thailand overall. \nNotwithstanding the accelerating interest among issuers and investors globally, the green bond \nmarket in Thailand is still in its infancy. Growing demand from potential issuers looking to \ndemonstrate their environmental and climate credentials is expected to change the current \nlandscape. The project will contribute to the development of the green bond market in Thailand \nby  showcasing  international  best  practice  approaches  to  green  and  climate  bonds \n(i.e., verification and certification) and building on ADB\u2019s momentum gained from working with \nmarket leaders for climate investment in the region. \n \n9.  Borrower.  Energy  Absolute,  established  in  2006,  is  the  largest  renewable  energy \ncompany in Thailand by installed capacity. Its main businesses are renewable energy generation \n(solar and wind) and biodiesel production and distribution. The company also plans to expand \n \n5  Green bonds certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative to be compliant with the CBS are considered \u201ccertified climate \nbonds.\u201d The key differences between the GBP and the CBS are that the CBS requires external verification to obtain \ncertification, which the GBP and the ASEAN GBS recommend but do not require. The CBS and the ASEAN GBS \nare based on and adhere to the GBP and so, typically, CBS-certifiable projects will also qualify under the GBP and \nthe ASEAN GBS. The ASEAN GBS is based on the GBP but contains additional requirements. \n6  ADB. 2015.

The  company  also  manufactures  and  distributes  biodiesel,  purified  glycerin,  and \nbyproducts, with a production capacity of 800,000 liters/day. \n \n12.  Energy Absolute is now pursuing further clean energy growth opportunities, such as \n(i) lithium-ion battery energy storage production; (ii) development of new renewable energy \nprojects outside of Thailand, and renewable energy projects with integrated battery energy \nstorage systems; (iii) electric cars and ferries, including associated charging infrastructure; and \n(iv) \"green biodiesel\"9 and phase change materials. \n \n13.  In December 2016, Energy Absolute embarked on its energy storage venture by acquiring \na 35.2% shareholding in Amita Technologies Inc. Amita was established in 2000 and is a \ndeveloper and manufacturer of lithium-ion polymer batteries for use in electric vehicles and \nstationary energy storage. It is listed on the Emerging Stock Board of the Taipei,China stock \nexchange. During 2017\u20132018, Energy Absolute gradually increased its ownership stake in Amita, \nending up with a controlling stake of 77.2% in November 2018.  \n \n14.  In 2019, Energy Absolute began building a 1 gigawatt-hour energy storage manufacturing \nfacility in Thailand\u2019s Eastern Economic Corridor region; production is expected to start in the \nsecond half of 2020, after a total capital expenditure of B5 billion. The facility is designed to prove \nthe  company\u2019s  technological  expertise,  manufacturing  capability  at  scale,  and  product \nperformance. Energy Absolute hopes that this first phase of investment into energy storage will \nhelp attract interest from potential strategic partners to significantly expand the facility. \n \n \n9  \"Green biodiesel\", also known as renewable diesel or second-generation diesel, is derived from biomass and can \nresult in lower lifetime emissions from engines that run on diesel fuel.  \n ", "4   \n15.  Energy Absolute boasts a strong financial performance, recording revenue growth at a \n9.4% cumulative average growth rate and improving its profitability continuously during 2016\u2013\n2018, as shown by annual improvements in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and \namortization; operating cash flow; and net profit. Almost all of the growth in revenue and \nprofitability  can  be  ascribed  to  the  successful  commissioning  of  multiple  renewable  power \nprojects, notably the Phitsanulok solar plant in 2016 (90 MW) and the Hadkanghan wind farm in \n2017 (126 MW). After commissioning the 260 MW Hanuman wind farm in April 2019, the \ncompany\u2019s revenue  and  profit  is  expected to further  increase  in  2019  and  2020.

Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n17.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) diversified energy mix \nthrough the addition of renewable energy capacity and (ii) use of the bond market as a mechanism \nfor raising capital for the private sector to meet larger and more diverse demands for long-term \ninvestment.  \n \n18.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome is that the viability of green bonds to sustain private \nsector operation of a renewable energy plant has been demonstrated. \n \n10 ADB. 2003.

The outputs are that a corporate bond by Energy Absolute is successfully \nissued, that the green and climate bond status has been achieved, and that the wind power plant \nis operational.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n  \n20.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which has a target of 75% of ADB operations to support climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030 and a target of $80 billion climate finance from 2019 to 2030.11 \nStrategy 2030 also emphasizes the expansion of private sector operations. ADB\u2019s support for the \nproject is also in line with its country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand12 and its \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2018\u20132020, 13  both  of  which  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment and support two core strategic areas for ADB\u2019s focus: infrastructure development \nand environmentally sustainable development. \n \n21.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.14 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target \nof $6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources for clean energy investments. \n \n22.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  have  so  far \nsupported three landmark green bond issuances in Southeast Asia: the Tiwi and MakBan \nGeothermal Power Green Bonds Project,15 the Thailand Green Bond Project (footnote 9), and the \nAC Energy Green Bond Project (footnote 10). The lessons from these projects is that green bonds \ngenerate a high level of interest but the process and benefits are still unclear to issuers, arrangers, \nand regional investors. ADB can play a valuable role by not only assisting the certification of the \nbonds  but  also  providing  market  validation,  helping  build  the  profile  of  green  bonds,  and \nencouraging further issuances. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The proposed project involves the issuance of a B10 billion corporate bond by Energy \nAbsolute in multiple tranches with tenors of 3\u201310 years. Proceeds from the bond will be used for \nthe long-term financing of Energy Absolute\u2019s 260 MW Hanuman wind farm in Thailand, including \nthe refinancing of short-term supplier credit that was used to help complete construction but does \nnot offer a long-term sustainable financing solution. The project reached its commercial operation \ndate in April 2019 and has a long-term PPA with EGAT.

ADB\u2019s participation in Energy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond issuance (which would not \nhave been issued as a green bond without ADB\u2019s advice) will ensure that the entire B10 billion \nbond will be certified under the CBS and also complies with the GBP and the ASEAN GBS. These \ninstruments and standards are not yet widely recognized in the Thai and ASEAN capital markets, \nand their association with ADB will help make certified green and climate bonds better known in \nthe region. ADB\u2019s involvement will also help foster confidence in the benefits of green bonds and \nhelp promote further investments in renewable energy and other climate-friendly businesses. \nFurther, ADB\u2019s participation in the green bond issuance will help support the Hanuman wind farm \nto achieve long-term financial sustainability. Energy Absolute\u2019s ADB-compliant environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) will also provide additional assurance to the market and \ninvestors of its credibility as an issuer of green bonds.  \n \n28.  Green bond program. The project contributes to ADB\u2019s goal to kickstart a program to \nencourage green bond issuance by the private sector, which will help attract commercial investors \nand issuers to this emerging asset class. By leveraging its regional presence, ADB will replicate \ngreen bond issuance in accordance with international best practice in Thailand and in other \nASEAN economies, with possible effects on other bond markets in Asia. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n29.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n30.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C). The policy\u2019s Safeguard Requirement 4 for a general corporate \nfinance project, with earmarked subproject, applies. \n \n31.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. A qualified external expert conducted an audit of the \ncorporate ESMS and a project environmental and social audit of the Hanuman wind farm. The \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of Energy Absolute to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts and the measures being implemented are considered adequate. The audit \ndid not identify any breach of national environmental or health and safety regulations. The \ncompany has agreed to implement minor corrective actions under a time-bound corrective action \nplan, including refining the corporate ESMS specifically for the Hanuman wind farm.  \n \n ", "8   \n32.  Environment. The project is not located in local conservation or protected areas, or areas \nof high conservation value. No forest land is involved in the right of way of the transmission \ncorridor used by the project. The initial environmental examination\u2019s avifauna survey results, \nanalysis of available secondary data, and consultations with relevant stakeholders indicate that \nthe project falls into a low-bird-activity area and has low intensity with regard to migration routes \nof large-bodied birds. 17 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n33.  Social. The project and its associated facilities are on government land (Sor Por Kor land) \nleased to the company for 27 years. The land was held under an agricultural lease by local farmers \nand  was  later  transferred  in  the  name  of  the  company.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED. No impacts on indigenous people are envisaged on account of the project. \n \n34.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements.18 \nEnergy  Absolute  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national \nlaws and regulations; and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB \nbefore disbursement. The ESMS sets out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with \nnational labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001).19 The ESMS will also contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in \nline with ADB standards. Energy Absolute will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its investments\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken.20 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n35.  Energy Absolute was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n  \n36.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n37.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),21 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that  the Government of \nThailand has no objection to the proposed assistance to Energy Absolute Public Company \n \n17 Key stakeholders include (a) the head of Sai Thong National Park, (b) local experts from Kasetsart University and \nKing Mongkut\u2019s University of Technology, (c) the project manager of Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management \nOrganization, and (d) representatives from Bird Life International and the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand. \n18 During due diligence, PSOD undertook a gender assessment of Energy Absolute\u2019s human resource and corporate \nsocial responsibility approaches. Given that ADB\u2019s financing will be channeled to a completed wind project with low \nstaffing requirements, no gender elements were identified for this transaction. However, through discussions with \nADB staff, Energy Absolute has agreed to continue to explore and implement feasible gender measures, such as \nimproved human resource practices (benefits) and preferential hiring of women.  \n19 ADB. 2003.
