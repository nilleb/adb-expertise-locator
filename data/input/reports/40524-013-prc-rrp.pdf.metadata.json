The project follows and complements a previous Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  loan  which  successfully  introduced  onlending  mechanism  to  finance  energy \nefficiency retrofits in a similar energy-intensive Guangdong Province.5 Shandong is the second \nlargest, in terms of industrial outputs, among all provinces in the PRC. Accordingly, the industry \nsector  is  the  main  energy  consumer  in  Shandong  consuming  more  than  three-quarters  of  the \ntotal energy in 2010. Moreover, the energy supply in Shandong is heavily dependent on fossil \nfuels\u2014coal  (71%)  and  oil  (26%)\u2014causing  large  emissions.  The  province\u2019s  total  energy \nconsumption  in  2010  was  340  million  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent  (tsce)\u2014around  10%  of \nthe national total. Shandong's gross domestic product (GDP) has grown consistently at a rapid \nrate,  expanding  from  CNY495.3  billion  in  1995  to  CNY3,941.6  billion  in  2010.  This  economic \ngrowth momentum in Shandong is expected to continue in the foreseeable future putting even \ngreater emphasis on accelerating investments in energy efficiency.  \n \n4. \nthe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  Shandong  Province's  energy \nconsumption per CNY10,000 GDP declined by 22.09%.6 In 2010, its energy intensity7 improved \nto  1.025  tsce  per  CNY10,000  of  GDP.  Despite  improving  the  energy  intensity,  the \nunderinvestment  in  energy  efficiency  and  the  existence  of many  energy-intensive  industries in \nthe  province  provide  significant  opportunities  for  further  energy  intensity  reductions  through \ntargeted investment.  \n                                                 \n1  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  approved  on  5  June  2009  for  $700,000.  ADB.  2009.  Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Project \nin Shandong Province. Manila (TA 7295-PRC). \n\nDuring \n\n2  Examples of some of the energy-intensive industries that will be targeted by this project are iron and steel, cement, \n\ntextile, and paper. \n\n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  Carbon  intensity  is  the  amount  of  carbon  by  weight  emitted  per  unit  of  energy  consumed.  It  is  also  commonly \n\nreferred as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.  \n\n5  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Grant for the People's Republic of China for Guangdong Energy Efficiency \nand  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program.  Manila  (MFF  0020-PRC,  approved  on  4  June,  for \n$100,000,000). All three tranches utilizing the full loan amount ($100 million) have already been approved. \n\n6  Shandong  Provincial  Government  has  successfully  achieved  its  target  for  the  11th  plan  and  will  set  an  energy \n\nefficiency improvement target of 17% per unit of GDP by 2015. \n\n7   Energy intensity is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's economy. It is calculated as units of energy per \n\nunit of GDP. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nThe  existing  industrial  energy  efficiency  financing  mechanisms  in  Shandong  benefit \n5. \nsmall  projects.  A  large  financing  gap  exists  for  medium-  and  large-sized  energy  efficiency \nprojects that involve all or part of an industrial manufacturing process for an industry.8 Three key \nbarriers  have  impeded  investment:  (i)  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  latest  energy  efficient \ntechnologies, combined with the enterprises\u2019 perception of production interruptions and/or loss \nof  revenues;  (ii)  difficulties  for  commercial  banks  to  assess  cash  flow  benefits  and  forgo \ncollateral for such investment projects which do not generate additional revenues; and (iii) lack \nof  capacity  for  evaluation  and  risk  assignments  for  energy  conservation  investments  by \ncommercial  banks.  Limited  market-based  incentive  mechanisms  to  reward  investors  for \nreducing  emissions  through  energy  efficiency  also  discourage  investors.  These  market \nimperfections warrant targeted public interventions. \n \nSeveral measures have been adopted in designing this project to address these barriers \n6. \n(para. 5). Accordingly, the FIL modality was chosen to (i) allow multiple rollover of the ADB loan, \nthus, providing larger investments for energy efficiency over the loan tenor; (ii) build knowledge \nand capacity of provincial government and selected financial intermediary in evaluation and risk \nassignments  for  energy  efficiency  transactions;  (iii)  reduce  transaction  complexities  and  costs \ndue  to  familiarity  and  experience  gained  by  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  the \nfinancial  intermediary  from  the  initial  subprojects;  and  (iv)  enhance  governance  and  improve \nsafeguard compliance for energy efficiency investments beyond the first batch of subprojects.   \n \nConsistent  with  the  Strategy  2020  goals, 9  the  project  encourages  private  sector \n7. \ninvestments. In the first batch, both selected subprojects are private enterprises. The emphasis \non selecting innovative technologies in the selection of the first batch of subprojects is expected \nto  be  maintained  and  further  intensified  for  future  subprojects.  The  project  design  includes  an \ninnovative  package  of  financial  incentives  and  rewards  (para.  21)  to  encourage  and  enhance \nparticipation from similar industrial enterprises,  thus, leveraging additional private investments. \nIn  addition,  specific  recommendations  and  actions  are  also  being  finalized  under  the  TA \n(footnote  1)  to  facilitate  ESCO  participation  in  the  future  subprojects.  This,  combined  with  the \nrecent  PRC  Circular  No.  25  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  on  ESCO \npolicy, will enhance engaging ESCO companies for the project.10  \n \nThe  selected  two  private  enterprises\u2014Golden  Yimeng  Group  (Golden  Yimeng)  and \n8. \nDongying  Lufang  Metallic  Materials  (Lufang)\u2014are  both  industrial  leaders  in  their  respective \nareas and are proposing state-of-the-art energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. \nThe  Golden  Yimeng  subproject  includes  expanding  the  biogas  capturing  system  to  generate \npower  and  supply  heat,  using  biowaste  as  fuel  and  to  produce  organic  fertilizers,  waste  heat \nrecovery  and  energy  conservation  from  various  process  units,  and  using  heat  from  solar \nparabolic  concentrators  to  supply  a  6-megawatt  steam  turbine  to  generate  electricity.  This  will \nbe the first such large-scale industrial solar application in the PRC. Lufang is among the top six \ncopper producers in the PRC. Lufang subproject will support and supplement the development \nof a zero coal copper ore smelting furnace\u2014an innovative technology. This technology will set \n                                                 \n8  The  size  of  an  energy  efficiency  investment  is  defined  by  the  estimated  investment  cost  of  a  single  energy \nefficiency technology intervention. The targeted energy efficiency investments of the proposed project range from \n$10  million  and  above,  compared  with  small-sized  investments  in  the  range  of  $1  million\u2013$5  million  or  less.  The \nsize of an industrial enterprise is defined by its annual revenues. According to the China State Statistical Bureau \n(2008  Guidelines),  enterprises  are  defined  as  medium-sized  if  their  annual  revenues  are  in  the  range  of  CNY30 \nmillion to CNY300 million (approximately $4.4 million to $40 million), and large if in excess of CNY300 million. \n\n9  ADB.  2008.

The involvement of CEB, a commercial bank, in rolling over the fund will \nbring  in  sound  banking  expertise  and  governance  in  energy  efficiency  lending.  It  will  also \nstrengthen  cooperation  between  the  government  agency  (the  PMO)  and  a  major  financial \ninstitution,  which  may  encourage  them  to  work  together  beyond  the  project  and  expand \ninvestments in this high priority area for the government. \n \n10. \nTo ensure that high standards with regard to due diligence and assessment are followed \nbeyond the first batch of subprojects, ADB, the Government of the PRC, Shandong Provincial \nGovernment (SPG), and CEB have agreed on a set of technical, financial, economic, social, and \nsafeguards criteria  for  selecting  subborrowers  and  subprojects.12 This  will  assist  the PMO  and \nCEB in managing risks in future subprojects.   \n \nB. \n \n11. \nShandong Province. \n \n12. \nintensive industries of Shandong Province. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  priority  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction  projects \nimplemented in selected energy-intensive industries; and (ii) capacity developed for government \nand  financial  institutions  in  planning,  investments,  and  management  of  energy  efficiency \nprojects. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe project investment cost, including estimated rollover of funds, is estimated at $553.2 \nmillion,  of  which  $141.8  million  is  for  the  first  batch  of  subprojects.  The  total  cost  includes \nphysical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges during development (Table 1).  \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  requested  financing  of  up  to  an  equivalent  of  $100  million  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  selected  energy  efficiency  projects  using  the \nFIL  modality,  including  taxes  and  duties.13 Provisions  of  the  loan  regulations  applicable  to  the \nloan based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) will apply.14 The loan will have a 15-\nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  10  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  an  applicable  commitment  charge,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.

The  longer  grace  period  is  essential  to  maximize  the \nbenefits of FIL so that the full amount of the loan is available for relending to a greater number \nof  industries  resulting  into  increased  energy  savings  and  emissions  reduction.

The  CEB  will \nestablish a separate escrow revolving account (para. 20). For subsequent subprojects, CEB will \nonlend  the  repayment  proceeds  to  the  eligible  subborrowers  via  this  escrow  account. 15 \nFinancing for each subproject requires at least 25% equity from the respective sponsor or the \nsubborrower.16  \n \n17. \nBoth selected subprojects, in the first batch, will have equity (29%) contributions from the \nsponsors  and  debt  financing  (71%)  from  ADB  loan.  For  future  subprojects,  it  is  expected  that \ncommercial banks will provide debt financing together with the revolving fund.

Relending and Onlending Arrangements \n\n \nThe PRC will be the borrower. The Ministry of Finance will relend the loan proceeds to \n18. \nSPG on the same terms and conditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. SPG will make \nthe  loan  proceeds  available  to  CEB,  under  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  escrow  revolving \naccount  management  agreement  for  further  onlending  to  selected  subborrowers  through \nsubloan agreements between CEB and the subborrower. \n \n\n2. \n\nSpecific Terms of the Financial Intermediation Loan Modality \n\n \nTo  maximize  the  benefit  from  the  revolving  nature  of  the  financing,  the  term  of  each \n19. \nsubloan will be no more than 6 years, including a grace period of 2 years. The loan repayment \nterm  for  all  subprojects  will  match  the  payback  period  for  each  batch.  The  onlending  interest \nrate will be set within the allowable band of the rate permissible by the People\u2019s Bank of China \nfor a commercial loan but would be 10% lower than the existing prime rate of the same term.17 \nThe  Shandong  Provincial  Finance  Department  (SFD)  will  bear  the  risks  of  currency  exchange \nand interest rate fluctuations. Only subprojects satisfying the selection criteria (footnote 12) and \ntechnically  appraised  by  the  PMO  with  the  assistance  of  CEB  will  be  financed  for  subsequent \nbatches. \n \n20. \nTo  ensure  that  ADB  loan  proceeds,  as  well  as  interest  payments  and  principal \nrepayments from the subborrowers are not commingled with the other funds being administered \nby CEB, a separate escrow revolving account will be established and maintained by CEB for all \ntransactions  related  to  the  project  and  administration  of  the  FIL.  This  will  ensure  that  the \naccount is kept distinct from CEB\u2019s own assets and provide protection against adverse results \nfrom  other  CEB  financial  operations.  Since  the  loan  proceeds  will  not  be  relent  to  CEB,  the \nrequirement  to  relend  ADB  proceeds  to  a  financial  intermediary  on  terms  no  more  favorable \nthan  ordinary  capital  resources  terms  is  not  applicable.  Rather  than  relending  the  loan \nproceeds, the funds will be made available to CEB under an escrow arrangement between SFD \nand CEB. \n \nSFD  will  establish  a  Shandong  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction  account  to \n21. \nprovide  support  for  the  project.  The  account  will  be  principally  funded  from  the  interest \ndifferential  between  the  FIL  onlending  rate  to  the  subborrowers  and  ADB\u2019s  interest  rate \n\n                                                 \n17  The interest rates of the local commercial banks in the PRC are regulated based on a prime rate declared by the \nPeople\u2019s  Bank  of  China.  However,  the  interest  rates  on  individual  transactions  are  allowed  to  deviate  from  the \nprime rate within a narrow band to reflect the credit risk of the borrower. The current prime rate in the PRC for the \nsame tenor of the subloan is 6.80%. With the 10% discount, the interest rate on the subloan will be about 6.12%. \nThe interest differential on the subloan will, therefore, be about 3.39%, if the equivalent fixed interest swap rate on \nthe ADB loan is considered. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n(footnote  17).18 The  account  will  be  principally  rebated  to  the  subborrowers  who  achieve  the \ntargeted energy savings, subject to monitoring and verification by independent consultants. \n \nSFD  will  pay  for  the  financial  intermediary  management  fees  (approximately  0.2%  per \n22. \nannum  of  the  ADB  loan  amount),  and  PMO  administration  costs  including  procurement  of \nindependent  consultants  for  professional  services  based  on  the  actual  amount.  These \nprofessional services will include (i) appraisal and selection of future subprojects; (ii) subproject \ncapacity  building,  where  appropriate;  (iii)  implementation  of  ADB  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements  for  the  project;  (iv)  subproject  performance  tracking  and  verification  in  terms  of \nenergy  savings  and  emission  reductions;  and  (v)  production  of  an  operations  manual  as  a \nreference  point  for  future  energy  efficiency  investments  in  order  to  replicate  the  experience \ngained  by  the  PMO  and  financial  intermediary.  To  meet  these  critical needs,  a  separate  PMO \naccount will be opened in accordance with SFD\u2019s procedure.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  summarized  in  Table  3  are  for  the  first  batch  of \n\nE. \n \n23. \nsubprojects.

Subborrowers will be required to follow the relevant \nprocurement  rules  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  for  financial  intermediaries, \nand  adopt  appropriate  procedures  including  (i)  payment  of  reasonable  prices,  and \n(ii)  fair  canvassing  when  selecting  suppliers.  Procurement  must  be  from  ADB \nmember  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be  encouraged  to  procure  goods  through \ncompetitive bidding or shopping when such procedures are most appropriate in the \ninterest  of  economy  and  efficiency.  A  procurement  manual  indicating  the  detailed \nprocurement  procedure  that  will  be  used  under  the  overall  project  implementation \nwill  be  prepared  by  the  PMO  before  procurement  activities  are  undertaken,  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  In  case  of  noncompliance,  CEB  will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. \nBoth  subborrowers  have  requested  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing \nup  to  20%  under  each  subloan.  A  total  of  six  procurement  packages  are  under \nadvanced  contracting.

Results of financial due diligence assessment \nof the first batch of subborrowers are shown in Appendix 2.22  \n \nA. \n \n26. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  for  each  of  the \nsubprojects in the first batch as well as for both the subprojects combined which are 23.3% for \nGolden Yimeng, 22.4% for Lufang, and 22.9% for the two subprojects, respectively. Sensitivity \nanalysis  shows  that  the  subprojects  are  financially  viable  under  various  adverse  scenarios.23 \nThe  financial  analysis  for  the  first  set  of  subprojects  is  assumed  to  be  representative  of  the \nwhole  FIL  project.  Specific  financial  criteria  (footnote  12)  are  formulated  for  future  batches  of \n\n                                                 \n21 Para.  15  of  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Energy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2) \n\nindicates the main lesson learned from Guangdong project.  \n\n22 Financial Performance and Projections of Subproject Companies (accessible from the  list of linked  documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n23 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nGovernance \n\nsubprojects  to  ensure  financial  viability  and  sustainability.

The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  including  environmental \nbenefits  is  calculated  for  each  of  the  subprojects  in  the  first  batch  as  well  as  for  both  the \nsubprojects  combined  which  are  37.3%  for  Golden  Yimeng,  39.0%  for  Lufang,  and  38.2%  for \nboth  subprojects  combined,  respectively.24 Without  environmental  benefits,  the  internal  rate  of \nreturn  for  Golden  Yimeng  is  27.6%,  Lufang  36.0%,  and  both  projects  combined  32.7%.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  under  various  adverse  scenarios  shows  the  economic  viability  of  both \nprojects. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nPolicy  and  regulatory  risks  are  minimal  and  the  benefits  from  the  project  will  ensue  as \nthe government and SPG are expected to maintain priority for energy intensity in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment up to 2020 (para. 3) and recent ESCO policy (para. 7).  \n \nA  due  diligence  assessment  was  conducted  for  CEB,25 which  is  a  national  commercial \n29. \nbank established in 1992. In 2009, CEB was on the list of the 16 best banks of Asia, and is one \nof the top 10 banks of the PRC. ADB was a shareholder and board member of CEB from 1996 \nto 2007. During that period, ADB provided a technical assistance26 and a loan27 to enhance the \ncapacity  of  CEB  in  prudent  banking  practices  and  successfully  introduced  international  best \npractices  to  CEB,  particularly  in  credit  appraisal,  post  disbursement  loan  management,  and \ncorporate  governance,  which  have  also  benefited  the  CEB  Jinan  branch.  The  CEB  Jinan \nbranch,  in  Shandong  Province,  is  a  major  onlender  of  loans  from  foreign  governments  and  \ninternational financial institutions,28 and is familiar with the policies and procedures of SFD. \n \n30. \nBy  the  end  of  2009,  CEB's  total  assets  reached  CNY1.198  trillion,  with  a  total  loan \nportfolio  of  CNY632  billion.  At  the  end  of  2009,  CEB  generated  an  operating  income  of \nCNY24.26 billion, with a net profit of CNY7.64 billion, an increase of 34.8% after excluding the \ntax  preference  factor  of  the  previous  year.  Return  on  equity  was  19.43%  in  2009.  CEB  has  a \nregistered  capital  of  CNY33.43  billion.  After  the  initial  public  offering  in  August  2010,  Central \nHuijin Investment (China SAFE Investment) continues to be the single largest shareholder with \na 49.61% stake.  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  SPG,  the  financial  intermediary,  and  subborrowers.
