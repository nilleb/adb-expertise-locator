THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the West Bengal Drinking Water Sector Improvement Project. The report also describes \n(i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; \nand (ii) the proposed administration of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund1 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility for \nStrengthening  Smart Water  Management  and Climate  and  Disaster  Resilience  in  Selected \nDistricts of West Bengal, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant and the TA. \n \n2.  The project will provide safe, sustainable, and inclusive drinking water services as per the \nstandards set by the Government of India to about 1.65 million people in the arsenic, fluoride, and \nsalinity-affected selected areas of Bankura, North 24 Parganas, and Purba Medinipur districts of \nWest  Bengal  (project  districts).2 It  will  introduce  an  innovative  institutional  framework  and \nadvanced technology for smart water management (STWM) to enable efficient service delivery in \nthe project districts.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  High arsenic and fluoride levels in drinking water threaten public health in India. \nAccording to a study conducted by the World Bank in 2010, 85% of all rural water supply schemes \nin India rely on groundwater.4 One of the greatest public health threats in India is from naturally \nelevated levels of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater. The Ministry of Drinking Water and \nSanitation of the Government of India estimated that around 27 million people in India are at risk \nfrom arsenic and fluoride contamination.5 Drinking water with high concentrations of arsenic in \nthe long term can lead to a range of health problems in humans, including cancer, while chronic \nexposure to fluoride may cause dental or skeletal fluorosis and bone diseases caused by \nexcessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. \n \n4.  West Bengal faces many challenges to its rural drinking water security. West Bengal, \nthe fourth most populous state in India, is by far the worst impacted, hosting around 72% of India\u2019s \ntotal population at risk from arsenic and 5% of the population at risk from fluoride contamination. \nOnly about 47% of West Bengal\u2019s rural population of 74.6 million has piped water supply, \ncompared to the national average of 56%, and piped water supply is through public standposts, \ngenerally at fewer than 40 liters per capita per day (lpcd).6 Government of West Bengal (GOWB) \nestimates that about 91% of West Bengal\u2019s rural population and 41% of its urban population still \nrely on its groundwater reserves for drinking, despite being located alongside two of the largest \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. One neighboring block in South 24 Parganas district, Bhangur \nII, was included in North 24 Parganas\u2019 drinking water scheme based on need and economy of scale. \n3  ADB supported project preparations mainly through the project preparatory technical assistance for State-Level \nSupport for National Flagship Programs (TA 9022-IND).  \n4  World Bank. 2010. Deep Wells and Prudence: Towards Pragmatic Action for Addressing Groundwater Over-\nexploitation in India. Washington, DC. \n5  Government of India, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. Integrated Management Information System (IMIS). \nData valid as of 17 May 2018. \n6  Government of West Bengal (GOWB), Public Health Engineering Department, Data from Integrated Management \nInformation System (IMIS). Data valid as of 17 May 2018. In 2013, the GOWB revised its standards for rural piped \nwater supply to 70 lpcd from 40 lpcd. \n ", "2 \nrivers in India, the Ganges and Brahmaputra (footnote 6). The excessive reliance on groundwater \nis aggravating exposure to arsenic and fluoride in drinking water, as well as the effects of climate \nchange. Further, increased withdrawal of groundwater along the state\u2019s coastal belt is resulting in \nintrusion of salinity in groundwater. Five of the state\u2019s 23 districts are affected by salinity, Purba \nMedinipur being the most impacted. The supply systems are also vulnerable to climate change \nand disaster risks, especially regular flooding.7 \n \n5.  Government\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  GOWB,  through  its  Vision  2020,  and  the \nGovernment of India, through its National Sub-mission on Arsenic and Fluoride, are prioritizing \nand investing in shifting people from reliance on groundwater through hand pumps or tube wells \nto sustainable surface water-based piped schemes.8 The British Geological Survey, which was \nengaged by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), conducted a detailed analysis of arsenic and \nfluoride in drinking water in West Bengal in 2017, including their characteristics, implications, and \nmitigation, as well as lessons learned from elsewhere. The study confirmed that piped water from \nsurface sources offers greater certainty in water quality security in the long term over in situ \ngroundwater treatment practices for arsenic or fluoride.9 \n \n6.  Findings from the sector assessment. The sector assessment shows that throughout \nIndia, sustainability of drinking water services has remained a major challenge despite achieving \ngood asset coverage, mainly because of weak institutional arrangements, limited community \nparticipation, and inadequate financing of operation and maintenance (O&M).10 Though the \ngovernment has launched various policy reforms and programs to decentralize service delivery, \nmost states are struggling to set the right institutional framework to match, and increase, their \nlocal bodies\u2019 capacities to manage services.11 In West Bengal, the Public Health Engineering \nDepartment  (PHED)  manages  water  supply  to  rural  areas  and  to  80  of  the  state\u2019s  114 \nmunicipalities.  It  also  provides  bulk  water  to  many  urban  agglomerations  and  municipal \ncorporations. In all rural areas, the PHED supplies water through public standposts, without \nhousehold connections. A survey commissioned by PHED in Baduria district of West Bengal in \n2016 showed that such public standpost-based schemes may not result in desired health impacts \nsince people may continue drinking from contaminated on-premises sources, such as hand \npumps or wells. Further, because of lack of funds and an integrated approach to planning, \nschemes are generally designed for smaller block-level habitations rather than spatially for a basin \nor a district, resulting in suboptimal use of water resources and loss of economies of scale. In \nNorth 24 Parganas district alone, the PHED manages 211 individual drinking water schemes. \n \n7.  Lessons learned. Lessons learned from ADB water projects in India and elsewhere show \nthat sustainability of assets and services created under projects are dependent on adequate \ninstitutional and operational capacity of local bodies to manage them, and establishment of clear \n                                                \n7  Around 42% of West Bengal\u2019s land area is flood prone.     \n8  Government  of West  Bengal,  Public  Health  Engineering  Department.  2011.

The inclusion of women is \nnecessary  for  ensuring  responsive  service  delivery.  The  GOWB  is  currently  implementing \nintensive rural sanitation improvement programs across the state. A sanitation improvement \naction plan was developed for the project to address identified gaps to ensure sustainable \nsanitation improvement in the project areas.13 ADB conducted a detailed capacity assessment of \nall 66 project gram panchayats based on their sociodemographic, financial, and operational \nresources, and ranked them to assist in their capacity building during the project implementation.14 \n \n8.  Government\u2019s sector reforms under the project and synergy with ADB\u2019s strategies \nand policies. As a result of policy dialogue during project preparations, the GOWB issued a \ngovernment order on 9 November 2017 to all 66 project gram panchayats, with populations \nranging from 16,000 to 26,000, on the asset management and service delivery framework \n(AMSDF),  which  (i)  clearly  defined  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  PHED,  the  gram \npanchayats,  panchayat  samitis,  and  zilla  parishads;  and  (ii)  set  guidelines  for  operational \nsustainability parameters such as metering, tariff, and human resourcing.15 The project, which is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2018\u20132020, will contribute to \nSustainable Development Goals 5, 6, and 13, and is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan.16 \n \n9.  The  project\u2019s  transformative  and  innovative  features  and  value  addition.  By \nincorporating the following features the project is expected to create an exemplary model for rural \ndrinking water services in West Bengal and in India: (i) through efficient use of surface water, the \nproject will preserve groundwater, enhance climate resilience, and reduce the burden of disease \nfrom arsenic and fluoride; (ii) subprojects stem from district-wide comprehensive drinking water \nquality action plans that analyze and integrate drinking water sustainability and quality needs. \nThese action plans will assist in guiding development and connect the existing and future systems \ninto a grid-based supply;17 (iii) the project will provide higher service levels compared with rural \nschemes in India in general, with individual household connections and district metering area \n(DMA) based metered continuous water supply;18 (iv) the project will use a high-technology-based \nSTWM system to efficiently manage water services, which will be a first for rural water schemes \nin the state and in India; (v) the project, through the AMSDF, will cement an innovative and \nsustainable institutional model for the sector; and (vi) the project will include women in service \ndelivery, and empower them through employment, leadership, and increased awareness. \n                                                \n12 Independent Evaluation Department. 2017.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: drinking water security ensured in West \nBengal (footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: safe, sustainable, and inclusive \ndrinking water service received in project districts. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project will have two outputs. All subprojects will be selected in compliance with the \nsubproject selection criteria in the project administration manual (PAM).19 \n \n12.  Output 1: Climate-resilient drinking water infrastructure constructed. The project will \nprovide a minimum of 70 lpcd of continuous potable water through metered connections to the \nhouseholds in selected areas of the project districts. The distribution systems will be designed on \na DMA basis. Both the bulk and the distribution systems will be integrated with modern STWM \nand  monitoring  tools,  including  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  and  geographic \ninformation systems. Bulk water supply systems, consisting of intakes, water treatment plants, \nand transmission mains, will be sized to provide water supply en route to urban and rural areas. \nThey will be connected into a grid with the existing and the new systems in the project districts, \nwhere feasible, to reduce redundancy, improve resilience, and efficiently manage the system. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Institutions  and  capacity  of  stakeholders  for  drinking water  service \ndelivery strengthened. The project will strengthen institutions and the capacity of stakeholders, \nincluding the PHED and the project gram panchayats, for sustainable service delivery. It will \nsupport them to operate the STWM system, including water quantity and quality monitoring, \nelectronic billing and collections, meter reading, and accounting.20 The project will build capacities \nand skills of the stakeholders on O&M, and support public awareness on water, sanitation, and \nhygiene.  It  will  strengthen  the  sector  through  introducing  and  implementing  an  AMSDF; \ninstitutionalizing water and sanitation safety planning; and developing a regulatory framework for, \nand piloting, fecal sludge and septage management.21  \n \nD.

A comprehensive procurement capacity assessment carried out by ADB found PHED \ncapable of managing procurement under the project. ADB also reviewed and approved the \nGOWB\u2019s e-procurement system and the master bidding documents for the project. Advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing will be provided for the project. ADB has advised the \nGovernment of India and GOWB that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the project. Procurement of works and equipment under the \nproject will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  The attached transaction TA, Strengthening Smart Water Management and Climate and \nDisaster Resilience in Selected Districts of West Bengal, will support the GOWB in strengthening \nSTWM, and climate and disaster resilience in project districts. It will assist in (i) implementing a \ncentral-level STWM system within the PHED; (ii) improving a flood-related early warning and \nresponse system in Purba Medinipur; and (iii) building capacity of stakeholders on O&M, climate \nchange, and disaster resilience. The TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on \na grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (footnote 1) under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.26 The PHED will be the executing and \nimplementing agency for the TA, to be implemented over 3 years. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The project is climate resilient and compatible with local capacity. The PHED engaged \ndesign consultants, supported by a large team of ADB grant-funded consultants, to undertake \nsurveys and project preparation, including evaluation of alternative techno-economic options and \nfull life cycle costs. ADB conducted a detailed climate risk and vulnerability assessment to ensure \nproject components incorporate necessary climate resilience and mitigation measures in the \npreliminary,  detailed  design,  and  implementation  stages.27 The  project  will  be  sustainable \noperationally by incorporating the following approaches: (i) ensuring that bulk supply schemes \nremain with the PHED, (ii) building a 2-year O&M period into the contracts for both the bulk and \ndistribution schemes to assist in capacity building, and (iii) implementing an AMSDF and including \nextensive capacity building of stakeholders through support from the attached grant and TA. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project will provide sustainable drinking water services in the project gram panchayats. The \neconomic analysis was conducted for the three sample project gram panchayats for which \nengineering designs were finalized: Chaltaberia, Kashbalanda, and Sonapukur Sankarpur. The \nestimated economic internal rates of return of these gram panchayats ranged from 13.0% to \n14.2%, while the combined economic internal rate of return was estimated at 13.5%, higher than \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, indicating significant economic \nreturns. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results are satisfactory, except under the scenario \n                                                \n26 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Summary Project Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nof all downside risks occurring together, i.e., (i) capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) overrun in O&M \ncosts of 20%, (iii) decline in estimated benefits of 20%, and (iv) 1-year delay in implementation.28 \n \n25.  Financial analysis. Financial analysis was conducted for the project to ascertain its \nsustainability and to determine the extent to which the water supply will generate revenues to \ncover O&M costs. An incremental recurrent costs analysis was conducted for the three sample \ngram panchayats, as the proposed water tariffs are expected to recover O&M costs only. The \nanalysis concluded that the suggested tariff under the AMSDF would generate sufficient revenues \nfor O&M cost recovery. A cash flow analysis was conducted in case unforeseen circumstances \nconstrain tariff revision or recovery. The financial projections of the sample gram panchayats \nshow that their revenue account will remain in surplus with (i) improved collection efficiency, (ii) \nan STWM system and financial management, and (iii) continued financial support from the \ngovernment. Implementation of an AMSDF will help them improve financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment concluded that the PHED can conduct adequate \nfinancial management of the project.29 The PHED has experience in handling large-scale projects \nfunded by GOWB and with external support. It has an established legal, institutional, and \nmonitoring framework available for budgeting, accounting, and auditing. Based on these factors, \nthe financial management risk for the project is moderate. The project design includes the \nfollowing  risk mitigation  measures:  (i)  building  PHED\u2019s  capacity  on  ADB\u2019s  project financial \nmanagement requirements, (ii) strengthening the PHED\u2019s project account and finance divisions \nby engaging qualified staff and consultants, (iii) strengthening the PHED\u2019s internal audit process, \nand (iv) implementing water user charge structure and its regular revisions under the AMSDF. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments of India and West Bengal and the PHED. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. The mitigation measures in the project \ndesign (i) establish regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to residents, (ii) use \nand maintain an e-procurement system to enhance transparency, and (iii) establish a grievance \nredress mechanism to ensure a quick and effective complaints resolution. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  Poverty  and  social.  The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  improving \ninfrastructure and quality of life, reducing women\u2019s drudgery, reducing health morbidity and health \nimpacts of arsenic and fluoride contamination, and stimulating economic growth. The project will \nprovide free water supply connections to the households in the project area, including the poor \nand vulnerable. Based on the affordability and willingness-to-pay survey carried out by the project \npreparatory team in the sample gram panchayats, user charges will be affordable (at less than \n2.5% of the mean monthly household income) and within the household\u2019s willingness to pay.30 \n \n29.  Gender. The project is classified as gender equity. The gender equality and social \ninclusion action plan for the project has clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocation.31 \nThe project will generate employment for over 350 locals in the project gram panchayats, of whom \n                                                \n28 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan and Gender Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n33% will be women. It will provide continuous potable water through metered connections to about \n390,000 households. This will reduce drudgery of women and girls and time poverty, and free \ntime for more productive work, including attending schools. Trade-certified trainings on utility \nmanagement will enhance local women\u2019s employability. The PHED will conduct a gender audit \nand develop and adopt a gender strategy. The project will institutionalize a gender-responsive \npolicy framework for drinking water service delivery in West Bengal through the AMSDF. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.32 \n \n31.  Environment (category B). The PHED prepared an environmental assessment and \nreview framework in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws to guide the \nscreening and environmental assessment of the subprojects. Three draft initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) reports prepared for the sample subprojects show that they are not likely to \ncause significant adverse environmental impacts, and that any impacts during construction and \nO&M can be mitigated through appropriate design and good practices. 33 The project will not \ninclude category A subprojects. The PHED conducted public consultation during the preparation \nof the sample subprojects and will continue consultation throughout project implementation. \nEnvironmental,  social,  and  resettlement-related  grievances  will  be  handled  following  the \ngrievance redress mechanism for the project, detailed in the PAM. All IEEs will form part of the \nbid and contract documents. All draft IEEs prepared will be updated during detailed engineering \ndesign and submitted to ADB for review and disclosure. The PHED will prepare and submit \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The PHED prepared a resettlement framework \nin line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws to guide subproject screening \nand assess resettlement impacts. Subprojects with significant involuntary resettlement impacts \nwill not be eligible for funding. Based on three sample subprojects\u2019 draft resettlement plans and \none due diligence report, the project will not cause significant involuntary resettlement impacts. 34 \nThe draft resettlement plans will form part of bids and contract documents, be updated during \ndetailed engineering design, and submitted to ADB for review and disclosure. The PHED will \nacquire land through negotiated settlement without recourse to expropriation as per GOWB \nregulations. Based on preliminary designs, around 7 acres are estimated to be acquired from \naround 42 private owners. The PHED will prepare semiannual social safeguards monitoring \nreports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans have \nbeen disclosed to project-affected people, and on the ADB and PHED websites. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Indigenous peoples or scheduled tribes comprise \n7.8% of the rural population of West Bengal as a whole. Based on three sample subprojects\u2019 \nappraised, scheduled tribes (i) will benefit from project investments as beneficiaries of improved \nwater supply facilities, free universal household connections, and capacity building and livelihood \nsupport programs; and (ii) are not considered to be made vulnerable by the project. PHED \nprepared  an  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n                                                \n32  ADB.
