No adverse environmental impact was identified. \n\n \nPakistan  continues  to  face  a  range  of  macroeconomic  challenges. \nWhile the food and fuel price shocks of late 2007 and early 2008 have \nlargely  dissipated,  the  economy  is  likely  to  be  on  a  slow  growth  path \nfor the next 2 years at least, because of the general global slowdown. \nReal  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  declined  to  5.8%  in  fiscal \nyear (FY) 2008, after averaging at 7% over the 5 years. It is projected \nto decline to 2.5% in FY2009.  \n \nOn  30  September  2008,  ADB\u2019s  Board  approved  the  AETP  program \ncluster  framework  and  two  loans  totaling  $500  million  for  the  first \nsubprogram  ($200  million  ADF  and  $300  million  OCR)  (AETP1). \nAETP1 supported credible measures to (i) cushion the poorest through \nsocial  safety  nets;  (ii)  move  toward  market-based  wheat  pricing;  (iii) \nresolve  the  long-term  circular  debt  burden  in  the  power  sector;  (iv) \nimprove risk management in the financial sector; and (v) launch work \non medium-term economic transformation.     \n \nIn parallel to AETP1 preparation, the Government sought advice from \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  on  policy  measures  to  restore \nmacroeconomic  stability.  Subsequently,  IMF\u2019s  standby  arrangement \n(SBA) to Pakistan was approved on 24 November 2008 in the amount \nof $7.6 billion equivalent and $3.1 billion was disbursed. On 30 March \n2009,  the  IMF  concluded  its  first  review  of  the  SBA  and  disbursed \n$847  million.  On  26  March  2009,  the  World  Bank  approved  the  $500 \nmillion  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Stabilization  Operation.  On \n17  April,  the  Friends  of  Democratic  Pakistan  pledged  $5.3  billion  in \nsupport of reforms and investments.  \n\n \nBorrower \n \nProposal \n\n \nClassification \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n\f \nThe  proposed  second  AETP  subprogram  (AETP2)  will  help  the \nGovernment  complete  short-term  stabilization  measures.  In  parallel, \nADB  will  support  Pakistan  in  taking  steps  for  medium-term  economic \non \ntransformation.  Future  AETP \nimplementation,  and  they  will  put  into  effect  public\u2013private  dialogue \nmechanisms to transform the economic structure gradually. \n \n\nsubprograms  will \n\nfocus \n\nin \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nfor  macroeconomic  stability  and \n(i) reducing  short-term  distortions \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The  AETP  will  help  Pakistan  achieve  and  sustain  higher  economic \ngrowth  in  the  medium  term.  The  expected  outcome  of  AETP2  is \nfiscal \nimproved  prospects \nsustainability \nthe \nthrough \nagriculture and energy sectors while improving the social safety net for \nthe poor and vulnerable, and (ii) strengthening financial intermediation. \n \nAETP2  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nstabilization  program.  ADB  has  participated  in  IMF  missions,  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s  invitation  and  with  IMF\u2019s  consent,  to  ensure  close \ncoordination on the reform agenda.  \n \nAETP2  supports  the  empowerment  of  women  under  the  Benazir \nIncome  Support  Program  (BISP).  The  amount  of  $150  million  of \nAETP2 will go to the BISP, whose primary recipients are female heads \nof  the  family  so  that  women  of  poor  families  can  directly  access  and \nmanage the social safety net benefits. AETP2 also will help women to \nobtain  national  identification  cards,  a  precondition  to  receiving  BISP \nbenefits.  The  national  identification  card  provides  women  with  a  legal \nidentity and will enable them to play a greater role in society.   \n \nADB  continues  to  be  a  lead  development  partner  in  Pakistan  and \nworks  closely  with  the  IMF,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development \npartners  on  macroeconomic  stabilization  measures  and  other  AETP \nreforms.  Thus,  the  AETP2  agenda  is  well  grounded  in ongoing  policy \nsupport from ADB and other partners, and regular dialogue with them.  \n \n(i) \n\n \nCoordination with \nDevelopment \nPartners \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAETP2  is  the  second  subprogram  under  a  program  cluster  of \nup to four single-tranche subprograms.  \nAETP1 (covering reforms from June 2007 to September 2008) \naddressed  the  food  and  energy  crisis,  supported  short-term \ninvestment  climate  measures,  and \nlaunched  studies  on \nmedium-term  structural  transformation.  This  subprogram  was \napproved by the Board on 30 September 2008.  \nAETP2 supports measures taken during October 2008 to June \n2009 on short-term social safety net, electricity debt resolution, \nand  risk  management  in  the  financial  sector.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment\u2014given  its  present  focus  on  short-term  crisis \nmanagement\u2014needs  more  time  before  reform  steps  can  be \nagreed for structural transformation. \nFuture  subprograms  will  focus  on  structural  transformation, \nbased  on  work  underway  since  mid-2008.  The  decision  to \nproceed is subject to resource needs, and reform commitment \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe proposed loans for AETP2 are:   \n(i) \n\n \n\niii\n\nand  progress.  It  is  likely  that  two  more  subprograms  may  be \nneeded  to  institutionalize  effective  public\u2013private  partnerships \nfor economic transformation. \n\nA  loan  of  $350  million  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  under  the  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \ninterest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper annum; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement.  \nA  loan  of  $150  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ADF,  with  an \ninterest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\nfor \n\nfinance  expenditures \n\n \nTo  retain  the  reform  momentum  and  predictability  of  financing,  the \nGovernment  has  requested  that  AETP3  be  processed  in  December \n2009  for  possible  approval  in  the  second  quarter  of  2010.  Subject  to \nreform progress and financing requirements, subsequent subprograms \ncould  each  be  in  the  range  of  $400  million\u2013$500  million,  putting  the \nAETP  program  cluster\u2019s  aggregate  in  the  range  of  $1.8  billion\u2013\n$2 billion.  The  scope  and  amounts  for  each  subprogram  will  be \nfinalized  during \nthe  respective \nthe  review  and  processing  of \nsubprogram. \n \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the OCR loan will be used first to support the adjustment \ncosts  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and  implemented  under  AETP2,  and \nsecond \nthe  Government\u2019s  general \ndevelopment  purposes.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local \ncurrency generated from the proceeds of the ADF loan will be used to \nsupport poor and vulnerable families that qualify via the new targeting \nscorecard method under the BISP set forth in output 1 of AETP2. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for \nAETP2. \n \nMOF  will  coordinate  with  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies  on  the \nAETP2 reforms, and it will help ensure that the reform agenda stays on \ncourse.  In  coordination  with  MOF,  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP) \nwill  handle  implementation  of  actions  relating  to  the  financial  sector. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  other  regulatory  agencies  or \nministries are consulted as required. ADB will closely monitor program \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  envisaged  outputs  and  outcomes  are \nachieved. \n \n \nLoan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \nProcurement and \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nDisbursement  \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nimports  will  require  a  certificate \n\ncountries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed \nagainst \nthe  Government \nstipulating that the value of Pakistan\u2019s total imports, minus its imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than \nthe  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  a  particular \nyear. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify \nthe accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nAETP2 will provide the following benefits: \n \n(i) \n\nfrom \n\nAssist the Government to meet the large and immediate fiscal \nneeds.  \nHelp  the  Government  to  transition  from  the  current  system  of \ninefficient  and  untargeted  subsidies  toward  a  targeted  safety \nnet  program  for  the  poor,  with  a  focus  on  women.  The  new \nfederal  social  safety  net  program,  the  BISP,  is  expanding  its \ncoverage  from  3.5  million  families  in  FY2009  to  5  million \nfamilies in FY2010 and aims to target up to 7 million families by \nFY2011. Benefits are paid to female heads of families. \nRaise  public  confidence \nstrengthening regulation and supervision of the sector. \nOpen the way for structural transformation. \nEnable ADB to sustain policy dialogue on structural reforms in \nsectors  where  ADB  has  been  actively  involved  through  past \nand current investments.  \n\nthe  banking  system  by \n\nin \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \nWhile  some  of  the  risks  to  AETP2  are  political and  outside  its  scope, \nits design will mitigate a range of others, including the following: \n  \n(i) \n\nInterest  group  resistance  and  poor \nintergovernment \ncoordination.  Those  adversely  affected  by  reforms  in  the \nshort-term  are  likely  to  resist.  The  Government  has  improved \ninter\u2013ministerial  and  agency  coordination  and  information-\nsharing to communicate reform measures more effectively than \nin  the  past.  Further,  the  single  tranche  structure  of  the  AETP \nsubprograms  ensures  prior  actions  by  the  Government  before \nfinancing  is  provided,  and  engagement  through  a  program \ncluster ensures sustainability of such actions.   \n\n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern which is elevated in \nthe case of complex reforms. Technical assistance is helping to \naddress this concern over the shorter term. Moreover, there is \nstrong ownership for reforms since the agenda under the AETP \nis also largely home-grown.  \n\n(iii)  Weak  fiduciary  controls.  With  large  amounts  of  safety  net \nneeds and assistance, it is vital to design and execute the BISP \nin a fully transparent and accountable manner. The World Bank \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nis  providing  a  dedicated  project,  backed  up  by  financing \nsupport; and ADB has worked closely with the Government and \nWorld  Bank,  particularly  to  strengthen  financial  management \nsystems.  \nGlobal  financial  crisis.  AETP  measures  are  predicated  on  a \nglobal  recovery.  While  the  program  cannot  influence  global \nevents,  it  can  help  cushion  Pakistan  against  exogenous \nshocks.  \n\n(iv) \n\ntime, \n\nthe  same \n\n \nAt \nthe  risks  associated  with  not  supporting \nmacroeconomic  stability,  fiscal  sustainability,  and  Pakistan\u2019s  social \nsafety  net  programs  are  very  high.  In  the  absence  of  timely  reforms, \nthe Government\u2019s budget would be continually burdened by costly and \ninefficient  subsidies,  leaving  far  less  resources  for  development \nfinancing.  The  financial  sector  would  be  vulnerable  to  systemic  risks. \nHigh  and  persistent  macroeconomic  imbalances  would  constrain \ninvestments and economic growth while aggravating poverty. \n \nThe underlying assumptions for AETP2 include \n   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nstrong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \ndevelopment partner coordination, and \nopen  dialogue  with \nstakeholders. \n\nthe  private  sector  and  other  key \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  second  subprogram  of  the  Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program (AETP).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nPakistan\u2019s  economy  suffered  serious  shocks  in  2007\u20132008  due  to  skyrocketing \n2. \ninternational  prices  for  oil  and  food.  The  severity  of  the  exogenous  shocks,  aggravated  by \nuncertainties  surrounding  the  political  transition  in  much  of  2008,  was  felt  on  several  fronts. \nOverall domestic inflation rose sharply to a year-on-year rate of 21.5% in June 2008 from 7% in \nJune 2007. External accounts deteriorated, with the current account deficit widening to 8.3% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  from  4.8%.  The  Pakistan  rupee  depreciated,  and gross  foreign \nexchange reserves declined by more than 40% to $8.6 billion (about 2.7 months of imports) by \nJune  2008.  On  the  fiscal  front,  there  were  unprecedented  needs  for  fuel,  food,  and  electricity \nsubsidies, which rose fourfold to PRs408 billion ($6 billion) from their originally budgeted level. \nSymptomatic  of  declining  investor  confidence,  the  Karachi  stock  index  dropped  by  more  than \n35%  during  April\u2013July  2008,  and  the  international  perception  of  the  possibility  of  sovereign \ndefault dramatically increased as evidenced by the yield for 10-year sovereign bonds which rose \nfrom  less  than  10%  per  annum  at  the  beginning  of  2008  to  more  than  25%  per  annum  in \nOctober 2008. The outcome was a decline in real GDP growth to 4.1% in FY2008 from 6.8% for \nthe previous year, with signs of a much steeper decline during the current fiscal year. \n \nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  Government  requested  ADB  and  other  international \n3. \ndevelopment  partners  to  provide  exceptional  financial  assistance.  The  Government  and  ADB \ndesigned  the  AETP  to  mitigate  the  adverse  short-term  impact  of  the  spiraling  food  and  fuel \nprices while helping Pakistan to address some of the more fundamental challenges constraining \nfaster growth. The Government developed a four-point stabilization plan2 which later formed the \nbasis  of  a  standby  arrangement  (SBA)  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  that  was \napproved  in  November  2008.  During  July\u2013September  2008,  ADB  undertook  extensive \nconsultations  with  the  IMF,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  key  bilateral  partners  to  formulate  the \nreform  measures  as  well  as  to  determine  the  budget  support.  Through  an  advisory  mission \nlaunched  at  the  Government\u2019s  request,  an  IMF  team  worked  out  various  funding  scenarios \nduring August\u2013September 2008. It found that Pakistan needed exceptional financing support to \nshore up its international reserves; restore macroeconomic stability; and ensure essential social, \nnondiscretionary,  and  critical  development  expenditures.  The  reforms  initiated  through  the \nAETP in 2008 and the budget support aim to \n  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nexpand and deepen social safety nets for the poor,  \nremove wheat pricing and procurement distortions,  \nbring power tariffs in line with costs and settle long-standing accumulated debt \nin  the  power  sector,  given  the  overhang  of  inter-corporate  receivables  at  $5 \nbillion (2.9% of GDP),   \nimprove risk management in the financial sector, and \ndiversify  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  to  increase  the  relative  size  of  the  industrial \nsector while boosting exports and creating jobs.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  Proposed  Program \nCluster  and  Loans  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation \nProgram. Manila (September). See also Box 1). \n\n \n\n\fFollowing  approval  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  for  the  first  subprogram  of  AETP \n4. \n(AETP1) on 30 September 2008, $500 million was disbursed on the same day to meet urgent \nrequirements and enable the Government to fulfill one of the key conditions in the stabilization \nplan  of  reducing  borrowing  from  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP).  The  local  currency \ngenerated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  AETP1  loans  financed,  among  other  things,  key  social \nsafety  net  programs  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the  food  and  fuel  crisis  on  the  poor.  More \ngenerally,  the  AETP  is  an  integral  part  of  the  financing  plan  that  has  emerged  as  part  of  the \nagreement  between  the  Government  and  the  IMF.  It  was  designed  as  a  program  cluster \ncomprising up to four subprograms that support short- and medium-term reforms. The proposed \nAETP2 carries forward the reforms initiated last year in a seamless manner, and it will provide \n$500 million in budget support to enable Pakistan to meet its urgent social and developmental \nneeds in FY2009.  \n \n5. \nIMF\u2019s  23-month  SBA  was  approved  in  November  2008  for  $7.6  billion  equivalent,  and \n$3.1 billion was disbursed immediately to shore up Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. The \nSBA aims to restore macroeconomic stability and confidence while achieving social stability and \nadequate  support  for  the  poor.  ADB  has  been  closely  involved  in  the  IMF  dialogue  and \nmonitoring and has participated in the review process. On 30 March 2009, the IMF completed \nthe  first  review  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  performance  under  the  SBA.  An  amount  equivalent  to \nSDR568.5  million  (about  $847  million)  was  subsequently  disbursed,  bringing  total  SBA \ndisbursements  to  date  to  an  amount  equivalent  to  SDR 2.64  billion  (about  $3.95  billion). \nPending  completion  of  the  second  review  of  the  SBA,  and  following  the  submission  of  the \n2009/10 budget to the Parliament, the IMF will release the next tranche under the SBA. \n  \n\nTable 1: IMF Program Structural Performance Criteria, Status as of April 2009 \nStatus \n\nTargets and Conditions \n1.

This  operation  complements  the  short-term  policy  reform \nagenda  initiated  under  AETP1  and  provides  budget  support  to  the  social  safety  net  and  for \nmeeting other needs. \n \n\nIII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS \n\nA. \n\nOverview3   \n\n7. \nReal  GDP  growth  dropped  to  4.1%  in  FY2008  after  5  years  of  averaging  near  7%. \nSignificant  factors  constraining  growth  have  been  a  sharp  decline  in  the  growth  of  private \ninvestment  due to political uncertainty, a worsening security situation, and the impacts of high \ninternational oil prices and frequent power shortages. The contribution of investment to growth \nfell to just 0.7 percentage points in FY2008 compared to 2.7 percentage points in the preceding \nfiscal year. The contribution of net exports to growth turned negative, especially due to the oil \nprice  hike  and  continued  slowdown  in  textile  exports,  and  the  manufacturing  sector\u2019s \ncontribution is expected to turn negative for the current fiscal year. \n \n8. \nWhen combined with the failure to align domestic prices with international prices, the oil \nprice shock and high wheat import price led to a massive buildup of unbudgeted and untargeted \nsubsidies  and  resulted  in  a  fiscal  deficit  for  FY2008  of  7.6%  of  GDP\u2014the  highest  in  9  years. \nAlso, interest payments on Defense Savings Certificates, which were issued in the 1990s with \nhigh interest rates, steeply increased interest costs and contributed to the larger deficit. In the \nabsence of additional foreign inflows (e.g., investments and remittances), the deficit had to be \nfinanced  mainly  through  domestic  borrowing  from  the  SBP.  Development  spending  was \ncompressed  relative  to  that  planned  in  the  budget  to  offset  some  of  the  impact  from  the \nuntargeted subsidies. The tax-to-GDP ratio came in at 10.6%, more than half a percentage point \nlower than projected in the budget.  \n \n9. \nSubsidies on oil, food, fertilizer, and power contributed to the budget deficit but failed to \ncontain inflation as food prices soared and the price of fuel was adjusted upward in the last 4 \nmonths  of  FY2008.  Steep  rupee  depreciation  stoked  inflationary  pressures  as  did  financing  of \nthe expanding deficit through borrowing from the SBP. The consumer price index on a year-on-\nyear basis climbed to 21.5% in June 2008 and to 25.3% in August, which was the highest in 30 \nyears. Core inflation also increased. As food prices rose sharply (by 32% in June 2008 year-on-\nyear),  the  poorest  groups  in  society  were  hardest  hit.  With  declining  international  commodity \nprices  and  a  slowing  domestic  economy,  the  year-on-year  consumer  price  index  fell  to  20.5% \nand food inflation to 21.6% in January 2009. Domestic inflation would have fallen by more had \nthe rupee not depreciated by 15.9% against the dollar in the first 7 months of FY2009. \n \n10. \nReacting  to  the  rising  inflation  and  the  sharp  increase  in  imports,  SBP  tightened \nmonetary  policy  three  times  in  FY2008  for  a  cumulative  rise  in  its  discount  rate  of  250  basis \npoints.  That  rate  climbed  by  another  300  basis  points  to  15%  (the  highest  in  South  Asia)  by \nNovember 2008 under the IMF program as inflation persisted, the drain on reserves continued, \nand  the  Government  sought  to  reduce  its  SBP  borrowings  by  making  treasury  bills  more \nattractive  to  commercial  banks.  By  April  2009,  inflation  had  slowed  to  less  than  17.2%, \n\n                                                 \n3  This  section  draws  from  the  chapter  on  Pakistan  in  ADB.  2009.  Asian  Development  Outlook  2009:  Rebalancing \nAsia\u2019s Growth. Manila. That information is updated with more recent figures, where available.  See also Appendix 2 \nwhich includes an updated fiscal note.  \n\n \n\n\fcompared with the record 25% level in the last quarter of 2008. This enabled the SBP to reduce \nthe discount rate by 100 basis points.  \n \n11. \nThe fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 4.3% of GDP in FY2009, as the Government \nhas  removed  or  reduced  subsidies  and  rationalized  development  expenditure.  It  already  has \nfully eliminated the subsidy on petroleum products and is undertaking a phased reduction in the \nelectricity  subsidy,  with  the  target  to  terminate  this  subsidy  by  the  end  of  FY2009.  A \nreprioritization of projects is expected to lead to a slashing of the development budget by over \nPRs100  billion  for  FY2009.  The  Government  has  also  frozen  supplementary  grants  to  various \ndepartments  to  infuse  greater  fiscal  discipline.  Fiscal  performance  for  June  2008\u2013March  2009 \nsuggests  that  the  annual  target  is  achievable.  While  the  slowdown  in  economic  activity  in \nresponse  to  the  global  financial  crisis  has  reduced  revenue  growth  below  earlier  projections, \nreflecting  in  part  lower  sales  tax  revenues  with  the  decline  in  imports,  revenue  from  the \npetroleum  development  levy  and  compressed  expenditures  will  hold  the  deficit  to  the  targeted \n4.3% for FY2009.  \n \nGrowth  is  expected  to  slow  to  2.0%  in  FY2009  due  to  the  global  slowdown,  the \n12. \nGovernment\u2019s tight demand management policies, and infrastructure deficits. GDP growth could \nrise  to  about  3.0%  in  FY2010.  But  there  are  considerable  downside  risks,  including  the \nworsening security situation.

Domestic  pressures  and  the  global  financial \ncrisis  have  led  to  greater  dollarization  and  a  continued  outflow  from  the  system,  which \ncontributes  to  deteriorating  liquidity  conditions.  In  response  to  liquidity  pressures,  in  October \n2008  the  SBP  reduced  the  reserve  requirement  by  4  percentage  points  and  eased  liquidity \nrequirements.  To  ease  the  strains  on  banks  and  other  deposit  institutions,  the  SBP  slowed  a \nmandated rise in paid-in capital for 2013 from a planned PRs23 billion to PRs10 billion (with an \nannual  increase  of  PRs1  billion  per  year  from  2009  through  2013).  The  capital  adequacy \nrequirement of 10% has not been affected.  \n \n14. \nThe crisis had a major impact on financial markets, with the Karachi stock index plunging \nby 57% in 2008. To halt the steep decline, the Karachi Stock Exchange Board imposed a floor \non stock prices in August 2008. This was eliminated in December. To revive the market after the \nfloor  was  lifted,  the  National  Investment  Trust  (the  government-owned  and  largest  money \nmanager in Pakistan) invested about PRs7 billion into the PRs20 billion State Enterprise Fund, \nwhich is investing in the stock market. The market subsequently rallied and has bounced back \nto precrisis levels. Increased confidence and improved terms of trade have helped stabilize the \nrupee  at  around  PRs80  to  the  dollar  since  October  2008  and  enabled  the  SBP  to  rebuild  its \ngross international reserves. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nImmediate Priorities and Challenges. Macroeconomic stabilization is critical, as fiscal \npolicies\u2014particularly  regarding  subsidies\u2014have  left  scant  resources  for  countercyclical  fiscal \nmeasures to address the downturn. Under the IMF program, the  Government will address the \nissues  that  undermine  flexibility  and  macroeconomic  stability.  The  budget  deficit  target  for \nFY2009 (4.3% of GDP) is sharply lower than the 7.4% deficit realized for FY2008 but remains \n\nThe Government\u2019s Policy Response to the Challenges \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nabove the 4% mandated under Pakistan\u2019s Fiscal Responsibility Act (2005). The initial target for \nFY2010  of  3.4%  was  well  within  the  authorized  range,  but  it  may  be  raised  to  accommodate \nincreased external support in the wake of rising requirements for social spending and displaced \npersons.  In  this  context,  policy  measures  will  focus  on  creating  fiscal  space  by  reducing \nsubsidies,  increasing  revenues,  and,  at  the  same  time,  strengthening  the  social  safety  net. \nThere are four key challenges. First, untargeted subsidies are the main threat to fiscal instability: \nin  FY2008,  untargeted  subsidies  for  power,  oil,  wheat,  and  fertilizer  expanded  to  nearly  four \ntimes  their  budgeted  amounts  (about  3.9%  of  GDP  versus  1.1%).  Second,  Pakistan\u2019s  interest \npayments are high by historic standards and are expected to remain at 4%\u20135% of GDP through \nFY2011. Third, Pakistan\u2019s tax revenues have consistently been among the lowest in the region \nat  about  10%  of  GDP.  Finally,  development  expenditures  rose  from  about  2.7%  of  GDP  in \nFY2003  to  nearly  5%  of  GDP  by  FY2007.  Sustaining  this  trend  will  require  resources  that \nPakistan does not have, reflecting capital inflows that are no longer available.   \n \n16. \nFY2009  Federal  Budget.  Despite  the  continued  global  financial  turmoil  and  attendant \nslowdown in economic activity, the Government aims for a much smaller budget deficit. About \n2.5 percentage points of the decrease are to come from lower expenditures, with the reduction \nin subsidies contributing to an overall expected decrease in fiscal spending equivalent to about \n1.6%  of  GDP.  The  Government  eliminated  the  oil  subsidy  by  December  2008  and  has \ncommitted  to  monthly  adjustments  to  pass  along  the  benefits  of  the  oil  price  decline  to \nconsumers. The differential power subsidy has been reduced and will be eliminated by the end \nof  the  current  fiscal  year.  In  addition,  a  freeze  on  non-salary  spending  was  imposed  in \ngovernment departments to curtail current expenditures.  \n \n17.  Maintaining public sector development spending at the FY2008 nominal level amounts to \na  reduction  from  about  4.3%  of  GDP  in  FY2008  to  just  over  3%  of  GDP  for  FY2009.  The \nremaining 1.8% of the decrease in the deficit for FY2009 reflects near-term measures to boost \nrevenues,  including  administrative  measures,  higher  general  sales  tax,  and  increased  luxury \nimport taxes. While tax revenues posted a considerable increase for the first half of FY2009, this \nreflected  in  part  the  contribution  of  the  petroleum  development  levy,  offsetting  lower  than \nexpected  direct  and  indirect  tax  receipts.  The  stabilization  targets  announced  by  the \nGovernment in the budget and the planned reduction in the fiscal and current account deficits \nare  important  to  reinforce  sustainable  growth.  There  are  risks,  however,  that  continued  global \neconomic and financial crisis will impact on economic activity and revenue flows.  \n \n18. \nFY2010  budget  targets  include  allowing  the  deficit  to  move  to  4.6%  of  GDP,  reflecting \nincreased  external  support,  particularly  for  safety  net  provisions  for  the  internally  displaced \npersons. Further spending compression is limited, as lower current spending from the full-year \nelimination  of  subsidies  may  be  offset  by  the  need  to  increase  public  sector  development \nspending.  Revenues  are  expected  to  remain  broadly  unchanged  as  a  share  of  GDP  as \nimprovements  in  revenue  policy  and  administration  largely  offset  the  impact  of  sustained  slow \nreal  growth.  This  is  supported  by  additional  administrative  measures,  including  reduced  tax \nexemptions.  \n \n19.  Medium-Term Context. Pakistan\u2019s strategic priorities are set out in Vision 2030,4 which \nidentifies  the  need  for  structural  change  and  transformation  to  achieve  a  developed, \nindustrialized,  just,  and  prosperous  Pakistan.  The  second  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper5 \nincludes  the  development  of  an  internationally  competitive  industrial  base  as  a  key  strategic \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy (2009\u20132013):  Pakistan. Manila. \n5  Government of Pakistan. 2009. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II. Islamabad.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\npillar. Over the short term, structural transformation requires sound fiscal policy with removal of \neconomic distortions while providing an adequate social safety net for the poor and vulnerable, \nas well as efficient financial intermediation. These objectives are the focus of AETP2, which will \nhelp create the necessary preconditions for structural transformation.  \n   \n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nIssues and Opportunities6  \n\nthe \n\nlatest  poverty  assessment \n\nTargeted Safety Net Intervention.   Based  on \n\n20. \nfor \nPakistan (FY2006), nearly a quarter of the population remains poor and a significant part of the \npopulation is clustered around the poverty line. The recent global food, fuel, and financial crises \nare expected to increase poverty unless appropriate policy measures are taken to protect poor \nand vulnerable families from these adverse shocks. The BISP was created in October 2008 as \nthe  new  major  social  safety  net  program.  It  focuses  on  poor  women.  The  program  targeted \ncoverage for up to 3.5 million families during the first year, providing a cash grant of PRs1,000 \nper month to eligible families whose monthly income is less than PRs6,000. Given the spiraling \ninflation and the severity of the crisis, the Government wanted to get the BISP launched quickly. \nFor  this,  the  BISP  distributed  8,000  forms  to  each  federal  parliamentarian  (members  of  the \nNational Assembly and senators) for distribution to eligible families in their constituencies based \non 13 criteria. Verification of eligibility and payments to eligible families was contracted by BISP \nto existing organizations. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) was used \nto  verify  the  eligibility  of  applicants.  Pakistan  Post  was  contracted  to  deliver  benefit  payments \nthrough money orders to the homes of verified applicants upon production by the female head \nof  the  family  of  her  computerized  national  identity  card  (CNIC).  As  of  30  April  2009,  3  million \nbeneficiaries  have  been  identified  under  the  BISP.  Of  these,  1.8  million  have  been  declared \neligible  by  NADRA.  PRs11  billion  in  payments  have  been  delivered  to  eligible  families  on  a \nretroactive basis (from October 2008, the date of BISP establishment). \n \n21. \nThe  separation  of  the  management  (BISP),  beneficiaries  identification  (politicians  and \npoverty scorecards), and payment benefits delivery (Pakistan Post) functions under the BISP is \nintended  to  guard  against  misuse  and  leakages.  In  line  with  program  goals,  the  targeting  and \nverification  processes  need  further  review  to  maximize  inclusion  of  the  poor  and  address \ncoverage issues of the CNIC database, as well as to improve the institutional arrangements for \nmanaging  the  program  to  effectively  engage  the  various  tiers  of  the  Government.  AETP1 \nsupported expanding federal cash transfer programs and improved targeting. The World Bank is \nproviding support to the Government to improve social safety net programs, including the BISP.7   \n \n22. \nUntargeted  Wheat  Subsidies  and  Inefficient  Reserve  Management.  Wheat  is  the \nfood staple in Pakistan. Given the large population of poor and low-income earners (small-scale \nproducers and consumers), stabilizing the wheat price has been a long-term Government policy \nobjective.  It  has  adopted  a  number  of  interventions  involving  (i)  the  wheat  procurement  price, \nwhich  is  the  support  price  paid  to  producers,  (ii)  wheat  procurement  targets  for  the  Pakistan \n\n                                                 \n6  This  section  presents  changes  in  each  focus  area  of  AETP  since  September  2008.  Otherwise,  the  background \n\nsection presented in the AETP RRP remains relevant.  \n\n7  Under  the  Department  for  International  Development  Poverty  Reduction  Trust  Fund,  the  World  Bank  is  providing \nthe  Government  with  a  $2.5  million  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  to  help  strengthen  the  BISP  program.  It  will \nfocus on the new scorecard targeting method. The World Bank recently approved a $60 million TA loan focused on \nbetter  coordination  of  federal  programs,  preparation  of  a  national  social  protection  strategy,  and  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  programs.  In  addition,  the  World  Bank  is  providing  program  support  through  its  $500  million \nPoverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation and $200 million Social Safety Development Policy Credit.   \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nAgricultural Storage and Supplies Corporation (PASSCO) and the provincial food departments, \nwhich  is  of  particular  importance  to  the  Punjab  province,  which  accounts  for  80%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  production,  (iii)  a  wheat  issue  price,  which  is  the  price  used  for  sale  to  flour  millers \nwhich  is  usually  less  than  the  cost  of  procurement  and  associated  handling  and  storage \ncharges,  and with quota allocations and concessionally priced sales of flour to utility stores, and \n(iv)  import  and  export  controls  depending  on  the  country\u2019s  production  and  domestic \ninterprovincial restrictions on movement until provincial targets are achieved.  \n \nIn  an  average  season,  Pakistan  produces  21  million  tons  of  wheat,  of  which  about  8 \n23. \nmillion  to  9 million  tons enters  the market.  The  Government  annually procures  around  50%  to \n60% of the market amount, ranging from 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons since 2002. Support for \nGovernment  interventions  in  procurement  (domestically  and  through  imports  by  the  Trading \nCorporation  of  Pakistan)  and  sale  of  wheat  at  issue  price  to  flour  millers  have  required \nGovernment  subsidies  plus  investments  into  state-owned  storage  facilities,  procurement \ncenters,  and  utility  retail  stores.  Also  needed  has  been  easy  access  to  credit  from  SBP  and \ncommercial  banks  to  provide  operating  capital  for  procurement  agencies.  These  measures \ninvolve  substantial  government  subsidies  (federal  and  provincial)  to  support  wheat  producers \nand  consumers.  These  interventions,  while  providing  some  price  stability,  have  not  been \nefficient  and  are  not  well  targeted  to  reach  the  intended  beneficiaries.  The  subsidy  cost  on \nimported  wheat  (1.7  million  tons)  in  FY2008  is  estimated  at  PRs40  billion  and  in  FY2009  the \nsubsidy on wheat imports (2.5 million to 3 million tons) will likely be at a similar level. In addition, \nsignificant  subsidy  costs  are  incurred  by  the  procurement  agencies  in  selling  wheat  to  flour \nmillers at issue prices that do not reflect full cost recovery.  \n \nUnder AETP1, to reduce the inefficient subsidies, the Government committed to market-\n24. \nbased  wheat  pricing  and  an  efficient  reserve  management  system  that  included  adoption  of  a \ntime-bound  action  plan  by  the  national  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (ECC). 8 The  ECC \nplan includes reforms in the producer procurement price and wheat issue price to flour millers \nthat support a move toward more market-based pricing, a reduction in the scale of procurement \nundertaken  by  Government  agencies  for  within-year  operational  reserves  and  inter-year \nstrategic  reserves,  and  an  anticipated  expanded  private  sector  role  in  wheat  marketing  and \nstorage. The approach adopted was incremental, reflecting the need to maintain price stability \nfor  producers  and  consumers  until  better  targeted  and  more  efficient  safety  net  programs \nbecome fully operational.  \n \n25. \nAETP  reforms  in  this  area  reflect  Pakistan\u2019s  experiences  in  the  wheat  market  during \n2007  and  2008,  when  high  and  volatile  wheat  and  flour  prices  caused  major  food  security \nproblems  for  low-income  households  and  social  unrest.  While  2008  wheat  production  was \naverage,  the  effects  of  the  government  procurement  policy  (and  in  particular  the  procurement \nprice)  caused  a  number  of  distortions.  The  2008  procurement  price  was  less  than  the  market \nprice (domestic and export parity price), and during the 2008 season the Government needed to \nraise  the  procurement  price  to  PRs625  per  40  kilos.  To  meet  market  needs,  the  Government \nimported wheat that was sold at a loss to domestic flour millers and imposed export bans and \ninterprovincial restrictions to achieve targets.   \n \n26. \nIn  September  2008,  the  Government  announced  the  2009  wheat  procurement  price  of \nPRs950 per 40 kilos (to be harvested from April 2009). The higher procurement price has had a \npositive  impact  on  production  and  was  based  on  cost  of  production  and  international  and \n                                                 \n8  The  ECC  is  a  cabinet-level  committee  of  the  Government  constituted  pursuant  to  Cabinet  Notification  No. \n5/3/2007-Com dated 2 April 2008. It comprises the Prime Minister, various ministers, and such officers as will be \ninvited (including the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and governor of the SBP). \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nregional wheat prices as of September 2008.9 In mid-February 2009, the Government held high \nlevel meetings to discuss the 2009 wheat crop, which is forecast at 25 million tons. Based on \ncurrent  storage  capacity,  the  announced  large  procurement  target  requires  establishing  and \nusing temporary storage facilities. To support private sector wheat purchase, the Government is \nfacilitating  loan  access  through  commercial  banks  for  flour  millers  (and  this  has  involved \nlowering the borrower required equity in for loans to 10%) on terms that are more favorable than \nin previous years.  \n \nThe wheat issue price to flour millers for the 2009 wheat  crop will be set in July 2009. \n27. \nWhile the issue price is technically set by the provinces, the Government has indicated that the \nwheat  issue  price  will  be  based  on  the  procurement  price  and  should  include  all  storage  and \nhandling costs incurred. Losses incurred from an issue price below the sum of the procurement \nprice and costs (e.g., for interest and storage) are made up from the provincial budget. The new \nprice will impact on flour prices and is expected to result in a 20% to 30% increase.  Appendix 7 \nprovides additional information on wheat marketing reforms. \n \nChallenges  in  the  Power  Sector.  Pakistan  suffers  from  a  chronic  shortfall  between \n28. \nelectricity  supply  and  demand.10 This  will  continue  to  seriously  limit  productivity  and  economic \ngrowth  until  the  financial  deficits,  corporate  governance,  and  technical  issues  in  the  power \nsector are resolved in a sustainable manner.  \n \n29. \nThe  financial  deficit  is  due  to  (i)  tariffs  being  inadequate  to  cover  operating  costs  of \npower  distribution  companies  (DISCOs),  let  alone  depreciation  and  a  fair  return  on  equity; \n(ii) nonpayment  by  government,  subsovereign,  and  private  sector  customers  for  electricity \nconsumed;  and  (iii)  the  excessive  accumulation  of  debt  owed  by  DISCOs  to  the  National \nTransmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) in its role as Central Power Purchasing Agency \n(CPPA),  NTDC/CPPA  to  public  sector  generating  companies  (GENCOs)  and  independent \npower producers (IPPs), and from these entities ultimately to fuel suppliers and refineries.11 The \naccumulated debt arrears is often referred to as the power sector circular debt problem.  \n \n30. \nBetween 2003 and 2007 in particular, the Government did not allow power tariffs to rise, \nnotwithstanding  petitions  from  DISCOs  asking  for  tariff  adjustments  to  cover  significantly \nincreased fuel prices and basic operating and maintenance costs as determined by the National \nElectricity Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).12 This caused (i) the tariff differential owed by \nthe  Government  to  the  DISCOs  to  grow  substantially,  with  the  unpaid  amount  for  this  year \nestimated  at  PRs84  billion  ($1  billion); 13 and  (ii)  the  public  sector  power  sector  companies \n(GENCOS, NTDC, and DISCOs) to ultimately borrow PRs216 billion ($2.7 billion) to cover the \ncash shortfall. Further, the amount owed to DISCOs for electricity sold grew and PRs209 billion \n                                                 \n9  In  the  interim  period,  international  wheat  prices  have  fallen  as  forecast  and  on  a  per  ton  basis  the  procurement \n\nprice is above the world price. \n\n10 In  March  2009,  supply  totaled  12,074  megawatts  (MW),  or  82%  of  peak  demand.  For  June  2009,  supply  is \nexpected to be 15,225 MW, or 85% of demand. Such shortfalls have caused widespread shedding and associated \ninterruption of industrial and other economic activity. See also Appendix 8 (Updated Energy Sector Briefing Note) \n11 The DISCOs, NTDC, and GENCOs as well as Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) were formed after the \nunbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA),  and  they  are  owned  by  the  Government. \nIPPs and for the most part the suppliers of fuel to the IPPs and GENCOs are privately owned.   \n\n12 NEPRA is the independent regulator of the power sector determining cost recovery tariffs that can be charged by \nIPPs and GENCOs for capacity and production of electricity, by NTDC for transmission of electricity to DISCOs and \nother bulk  purchasers, and  by DISCOs for distributing electricity to customers. The difference between the tariffs \ndetermined by NEPRA and those notified by the Government is referred to as the tariff differential. \n\n13 For FY2008, PRs35 billion ($0.45 billion) was paid in cash and the actual tariff differential subsidy equaled PRs87 \nbillion ($0.95 billion). For the first 9 months of FY2009, PRs87 billion has been claimed and PRs59 billion has been \npaid.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n($2.6  billion).  Of  this,  (i)  PRs80  billion  ($1  billion)  is  owed  by  consumers  in  the  Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas (FATA), which is unlikely to be recovered and consumers cannot be \ncut  off  for  national  reasons;  and  (ii)  PRs80  billion  from  the  privately  owned  Karachi  Electricity \nSupply Company of which PRs31 billion will be borne by Government.  \n \n31. \nInadequate  tariffs,  nonpayment  of  the  tariff  differential  subsidy,  and  nonpayment  for \nelectricity consumed are thus the key factors causing overdue receivables owed by DISCOs to \nNTDC/CPPA to reach PRs407 billion ($5 billion)14 and those owed by NTDC/CPPA to GENCOs \nand IPPs to grow to PRS250 billion ($3.1 billion). This caused (i) DISCOs and GENCOs to defer \ncritically needed operating and maintenance expenditures to decrease losses, (ii) GENCOs and \nIPPs  to  run  out  of  cash  needed  to  purchase  fuel  for  producing  electricity  at  their  optimal \ncapacities,  and  (iii)  ultimately  to  the  Government\u2019s  taking  the  first  step  to  resolve  the  circular \ndebt  problem  by  guaranteeing  the  issuance  by  NTDC  of  PRs92  billion  in  term  financing \ncertificates (TFCs) to convert the short-term trade debt into midterm debt obligations.15  \n \n32. \nLimited  Financial  Intermediation.  Strengthening  financial  governance  has  become \nmore urgent as a result of the global financial turmoil, which has led to liquidity constraints in the \nlocal banking system. In Pakistan, there is an additional risk of contagion given interconnected \nand direct lending among banking groups. Because of the Pakistan banking sector\u2019s structure \nand current regulatory architecture, such risks are currently difficult to supervise.  \n \n33. \nPakistan  has  adopted  an  institutional  approach  to  regulation  and  supervision  under \nwhich  a  firm\u2019s  legal  status  (e.g.,  as  a  bank,  broker-dealer,  insurance  company)  determines \nwhich  regulator  is  tasked  with  overseeing  its  activity  from  a  safety,  soundness,  and  business \nconduct  perspective.  The  SBP  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  the  banking  sector,  while  the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  (SECP)  is  responsible  for  overseeing \nnonbank  finance  companies  (NBFCs),  some  of which  are  engaged  in  deposit-taking  activities. \nOngoing financial sector consolidation has blurred traditional lines of business activity, creating \nsupervisory  challenges  and  increasing  systemic  risks.  Prudential  risks  are  difficult  to  monitor \nacross  different  segments  of  the  financial  system,  which  are  overseen  by  different  regulators \nhaving  different  regulatory  mandates.  In  the  absence  of  proper  consolidated  supervision  in \nconformity with Basel Core Principle 24,16 a financial conglomerate, or any of its subsidiaries or \naffiliates,  may  become  vulnerable  to  double  counting  of  capital,  large  intra-  and  extra-group \nexposures, contagion problems among entities within the conglomerate, and conflicts of interest \nbetween  business  units  within  the  conglomerate.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  to  avoid  scrutiny \nlosses from banks will be transferred to less regulated and supervised NBFCs, including those \ntaking deposits. \n \n34. \nOne  of  the  emerging  lessons  arising  from  the  global  financial  crisis  is  the  difficulty  in \nsupervising financial conglomerates where there is more than one financial regulator. While in \nmany countries, including Pakistan, financial sector regulators using the institutional approach to \nsupervision have adopted various coordination mechanisms to try and address supervisory and \nregulatory  gaps,  many  of  these  mechanisms  have  not  been  sufficient  to  detect  and  prevent \nsystemic risks associated with financial conglomerates.   \n\n                                                 \n14 This  amount  was  due  at  the  end  of  March  2009  and  represented  a  44%  increase  over  the  PRs286  billion  ($3.6 \n\nbillion) owed at the end of June 2008. \n\n15 Appendix 8 summarizes the issuance of PRs92 billion of TFCs by NTDC, proceeds from which were used to repay \n\namounts owed to GENCOs and IPPs, to their fuel suppliers, and ultimately trade credit provided by banks.  \n\n16 Basic  Core  Principal  24  requires  banking  supervisors  to  \"supervise  banking  groups  on  a  consolidated  basis, \nadequately monitoring and, where appropriate, applying prudential norms to all aspects of the business conducted \nby the group.\" \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n35. \nOther  AETP  reforms  in  this  sector  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  better  manage \nsystemic risks. The focus of AETP1 reforms was to develop a new institutionalized structure to \nsupport  better  management  of  these  risks.  Under  AETP1,  cabinet  approval  was  obtained  for \nlegislative amendments that would establish a regime for consolidated supervision, under which \nthe SBP would become the lead supervisor of financial groups and conglomerates. Licensing, \nregulatory, and supervisory authority over deposit-taking institutions would be transferred to the \nSBP.  AETP1  also  included  legislative  amendments  to  provide  for  greater  accountability  and \nindependence  of  the  SBP,  clarify  its  role  in  the  financial  safety  net  and  lender  of  last  resort \nfunction, and strengthen autonomy of the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU). AETP1 also included \npreparation  of  a  new  consumer  protection  law  and  a  deposit  protection  law,  along  with \nimprovements  in  payment  and  settlement  systems.  Additional  background  information  on  the \nfinancial sector is set forth in Appendix 10. \n \nB. \n \n36. \nAchievements. Policy dialogue and reforms under AETP1 helped Pakistan mitigate the \nfuel  and  food  price  shocks  in  2008.  The  budget  support  has  helped  Pakistan  meet  its  critical \nexpenditures at a time of fiscal compression and bolster public and investor confidence. Under \nAETP1, the Government put in place a major new targeted social safety program, the BISP, and \nbegan  its  rollout.  The  Government  initiated  steps  to  resolve  electricity  debts.  Electricity  tariffs \nwere  raised  and  the  Government  began  to  clarify  the  intercorporate  circular  debt  chain  and \ndetermine  the  debt  liabilities  in  the  system.  Table  4  summarizes  achievements  under  AETP1 \nand how the AETP2 actions build upon these reforms.  \n\nAchievements under Subprogram 1 and Lessons Learned \n\n \nTable 4: Accelerating Economic Transformation Program \u2013 \nAchievements under Subprogram 1 and Current Status of Reforms under Subprogram 2   \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram 1 Activities (Until \nSeptember 2008) \n\nAchievements and  \nStatus as of June 2009 \n\nOutput 1: Immediate distortions removed to initiate structural transformation \nOutput 1.1: Targeted safety nets designed and rolled out for the poor and vulnerable households \nSocial  safety  net  cover  for  up  to  5  million \nSocial  impact  of  food  and \npoor  households  provided  for  through \nfuel  inflationary  pressures \nallocation  of  PRs41  billion  in  FY2009 \nmitigated  through  targeted \nbudget \nsocial safety net programs \n \n \n \n \nClear  criteria  developed \nfor  selecting \nbeneficiaries of cash transfers through the \nBenazir Income Support Program (BISP)  \n \n\nReforms  are  on  track.

The  Government  has \nput in place an automatic fuel price adjustment \nmechanism.  It  also  increased  power  tariffs  by \nan  average  17%  in  September  2008.  With  full \ncost-recovery  tariffs  planned  from  September  \n2009, all subsidies are likely to be eliminated. \n \nTo  resolve  the  circular  debt  problem,  the \nGovernment,  working  closely  with  ADB,  the \nWorld  Bank,  and  the  IMF,  has  adopted  a \ncomprehensive  debt  resolution  plan  for  the \npower  sector  (Appendix  9).  In  addition  to  cost \nrecovery tariffs, the plan includes placement of \ndebt into a new debt holding company outside \nthe  power  sector,  and  the  development  of  a \nfinancing plan for servicing and  repayment of \nthe debt. \n\nOutput 2: Financial intermediation strengthened to support structural transformation \nPrudential  regulation  and \nsupervision strengthened  \n\ncapital \nII \n\nraised  minimum \n\nfinancial  markets \n\nSBP  has  drafted  a  new  banking  act \naligning it with international best practices. \n \nSBP  has \nrequirements  as  part  of  Basel \nimplementation. \n \nSBP  has  launched  work  on  a  10-year \nbanking  sector  strategy  to  broaden  and \ndiversify \nwhile \ndeveloping supportive financial safety nets \nplus  safeguards  for  consumer  protection \nand  effectively  fighting  against  money \nlaundering and financial crimes. \n \nCabinet  approval  obtained  for  legislative \namendments  to  enable  SBP  to  better \nmanage  systemic  risks  by  (i)  adopting  a \nconsolidated \nframework, \nsupervisory \nallowing SBP to be the lead supervisor of \nfinancial  groups  and  conglomerates  in \ncompliance  with  Basel  Core  Principle  24; \nlicensing, \nand \nregulatory,  and  supervisory  authority  over \ndeposit-taking institutions to SBP \n\ntransferring \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\nReforms are substantively on track, but the \nGovernment  and  regulatory  bodies  want  a \nmore  holistic  and  radical  approach  to \nachieve  consolidated  supervision.

There \nis  evidence  of  growing \ndollarization.  With  support  from  the  IMF,  SBP \nhas  in  place  a  plan  to  promptly  address \nbanking sector problems as they emerge. \n \nAll AETP1 actions are on track, and legislative \nreforms are moving ahead.

There  are  three  key  lessons.  First,  planning  for  medium-term  reforms  when \ncountries are struggling to cope with short-term issues is difficult. The structural transformation \nagenda  needs  much  greater  attention,  as  it  may  alter  the  sectoral  and  industrial  landscape  in \nPakistan.  Although  significant  analytical  work  has  been  undertaken  with  ADB  support  and \nseveral  rounds  of  consultations  have  taken  place  with  senior  government  officials  and  private \nsector  representatives,  the  ADB  team\u2019s  assessment  is  that  it  would  be  better  to  focus  on \nmedium-term reforms in the later part of 2009 and early 2010.  \n \n38. \nSecond, consultation with key stakeholders is necessary to build ownership for reforms \nand realistic expectations as to the time frame for implementation, the implementation risks, and \nthe  design  of  risk  mitigation  measures.  In  the  context  of  AETP1,  this  lesson  applies  to  both \nwheat  policy  issues  and  the  financial  sector.  While  ADB\u2019s  consultations  regarding  wheat  have \nbeen  largely  with  the  Government  and  private  sector  business  entities,  dramatically  changing \nglobal wheat market conditions have underscored the fact that farmers and consumers are also \naffected  parties.  In  the  case  of  financial  sector  regulation,  the  authorities  obtained  cabinet \napproval  for  legislative  measures  on  consolidated  supervision.  Yet,  with  the  financial \narchitecture  being  reexamined  in  many  countries  in  light  of  the  crisis,  the  Government  and \nregulatory agencies have taken a position that they would like to explore more in-depth reforms \ninstead of making incremental legislative amendments. Earlier and deeper consultations among \nall parties concerned might have been helpful in shaping ideas and conserving time.  \n \n39. \nin the Government and regulatory agencies that become even more acute at times of crisis.  \n \nC. \n\n Third, expectations on multiple outcomes need to be modest due to capacity constraints \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\nA  number  of  other  development  partners  have  been  involved  in  broad  fiscal,  social \n40. \nsafety  net,  agricultural,  power,  and  financial  sector  reforms  in  Pakistan.  There  has  also  been \nsignificant  development  partner  support  for  a  range  of  cross-cutting  issues  covered  in  AETP. \nThe sector agenda in AETP has benefited from ADB\u2019s past work in the relevant sectors, from \nongoing dialogue with the IMF and World Bank on macroeconomic stabilization measures, and \nfrom dialogue with the World Bank and other development partners on both social safety nets \nfor the poor and vulnerable and resolution of the circular debt in the energy sector.    \n \nThe  Friends  of  Pakistan  is  a  group  supporting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to \n41. \nconsolidate democracy in Pakistan and fund social and economic development in the country. \nThe group was launched in New York on 26 September 2008 and consists of 25 countries and \nmultilateral  institutions,  including  Canada,    France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  the  Netherlands, \nNordic countries, People\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, United \nStates,  and  the  ADB,  European  Union,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  United  Nations,  and  the \nWorld Bank. \n \nAt  a  senior  level  meeting  of  the  Friends  of  Pakistan  group  held  in  Tokyo  on  17  April \n42. \n2009, the Government of Pakistan received $5.28 billion in additional pledges of support over 2 \nyears.  The  meeting  and  a  Donors  Conference  were  attended  by  31  countries  and  18 \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ninternational institutions. The meeting also endorsed the establishment of follow-up mechanisms \nfor  international  cooperation  and  coordination,  including  the  formation  of  working  groups  (of \ninterested  countries  and  institutions)  in  the  identified  areas  of  development,  security,  energy, \ninstitution capacity building, trade, and finance. The Friends also agreed to strengthen existing \ndonor coordination mechanisms.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n43. \nThe  AETP  will  help  Pakistan  pave  the  way  to  restoring  the  precrisis  growth  path.  The \nshort-term outcomes of AETP1 and AETP2 are to create fiscal space. The outputs under these \ntwo  phases  will  include  better  targeting  of  subsidies  and  improved  risk  management  in  the \nfinancial sector. Over the medium-term, the follow-up phases of AETP3 and AETP4 (which will \nbe processed subject to satisfactory progress) will support structural transformation. \n \nAETP  is  structured  as  a  program  cluster  of  four  subprograms  to  be  implemented  over \n44. \n2007\u20132011. AETP1 helped the Government address fiscal implications of the food and energy \ncrisis,  as  well  as  short-term  investment  climate  problems.  It  also  initiated  reforms  that  will  be \ncarried  forward  in  the  medium  term.  AETP2,  in  continuation  of  AETP1,  will  focus  on \nmacroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability by reducing distortions in the wheat and energy \nsectors,  addressing  the  circular  debt  in  the  energy  sector,  and  strengthening  the  social  safety \nnet. AETP2 will also strengthen financial intermediation. To better reflect the time frame needed \nfor  adopting  a  national  structural  transformation  strategy,  policy  actions  directly  supporting \nstructural  transformation  will  not  be  included  not  in  AETP2  but  in  subsequent  subprograms. \nDeteriorating  security  conditions  have  delayed  consultations  needed  to  identify  strong \nleadership and ownership for structural transformation.   \n \nAppendix 3  presents the Government\u2019s development policy letter. The policy matrix for \n45. \nAETP2 in Appendix 4 lays out the policy actions for AETP2 and indicative outputs and activities \nfor subsequent subprograms under this cluster. The activities for subsequent subprograms will \ncontinue to be refined over the next few years, subject to satisfactory implementation progress. \nThe  indicators  will  be  updated  periodically,  depending  on  implementation  progress.  ADB  has \nrequested the IMF to provide a macroeconomic assessment in connection with AETP2. The IMF \nhas agreed to provide the assessment to ADB on 8 June 2009. Once received, the assessment \nwill be separately circulated. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\n1. \n\nRemove Immediate Distortions in the Food and Energy Sectors and Protect \nthe Poor and Vulnerable through Targeted Safety Net Programs \n\n46. \nTargeted Safety Nets Designed and Rolled Out for the Poor and Vulnerable. Under \nAETP2, the Government aims to extend BISP coverage to at least 5 million families in FY2010. \nThe BISP has become fully operational. The BISP office in Islamabad has been established to \nmanage  the  program  and  provincial  offices  are  being  set  up.  Most  positions  in  BISP \nheadquarters have been filled and the directors of the provincial offices have been appointed.  \n \nUnder  AETP2,  targeting  of  beneficiaries  has  also  been  improved.  In  May  2009,  BISP \n47. \nstarted  piloting  in  16  districts  the  new  targeting  method  using  poverty  score  cards  to  identify \neligible families. Based on lessons learned from the pilot project, the poverty score card will be \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nrolled  out  to  all  130  districts  in  Pakistan.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  providing  assistance  to \nstrengthen  BISP\u2019s  program  administration  and  fiduciary  structure,  as  well  as  to  establish  and \nimplement  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  plus  a  grievance  redress  system.  BISP \nexpansion under the new targeting method and improved fiduciary controls will be reflected in \nsubsequent AETP programs. More details on the BISP are included in Appendix 6.    \n \n48. \nToward  Market-Based  Wheat  Pricing  and  Introduction  of  an  Efficient  Wheat \nReserve  Management  System.  Under  AETP1,  the  Government  adopted  an  action  plan  to \nmove to a more market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management system. Under \nAETP2,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  implement  a  formula-based  system  for  (i)  setting  the \nprocurement price for farmers to ensure that such price operates as a floor price and remains \nbelow the competitive market price, and (ii) ensuring that the wheat issue price reflects related \ncosts, including those for transport and storage. An efficient safety net program will eliminate the \nneed to subsidize the issue price, which subsidy is in large part captured by flour millers. Under \nsubsequent  subprograms,  implementation  of  the  ECC  action  plan  will  be  assessed  and  key \nreform  initiatives  implemented  will  be  reflected.  For  AETP3,  the  Government  expects  that \nstrategic  reserves  will  be  maintained  at  2  months  of  annual  consumption  and  that  operational \nreserves will be eliminated.   \n \n49. \nInitiating  Power  Sector  Debt  Resolution.  Under  AETP2,  the  Government  adopted  a \npower sector circular debt resolution plan (Appendix 9)17 and has begun with its implementation. \nThe  plan,  which  was  developed  in  close  consultation  with  ADB,  the  IMF,  and  the  World  Bank \nshould resolve the circular debt problem and more broadly the financial deficit in this sector. It \nshould  indirectly  support  improved  corporate  governance  and  reduce technical  issues  (losses, \ntheft, antiquated equipment, etc.), which have caused the chronic shortfall in Pakistan\u2019s power \nsupply.  The  plan  clarifies  the  amount  of  the  debt  and  key  activities,  including  measures  to \nprevent reoccurrence and ensure sustainable debt servicing. It identifies financing sources and \nagreements and includes milestones, an implementation timetable, and a monitoring framework.  \n \n50. \n\nThe key components of the plan can be group under three headings: \n(i) \n\nTimely notification of cost recovery tariff \n(a)  The  NEPRA  Act  will  be  amended  by  30  June  2009  to  enable  the \n\ndetermination and enforcement of tariff adjustments in a timely manner. \n\n(b)  Notification  of  tariffs  will  not  exceed  15  days  from  determination  and  the \nmonthly  fuel  and  power  purchase  adjustments  will  be  made  effective \nautomatically upon determination by NEPRA.  \n\n(c)  Electricity tariffs will be determined by NEPRA quarterly.  \n(d)  A  business  plan  for  FY  2009/10  has  been  prepared  to  support  tariff  reform \nand maximize outputs and sales in electricity and minimize costs by reducing \nsystem losses. Under this plan, electricity tariffs will be increased by 17.5% or \nas  later  determined  by  NEPRA  to  meet  the  zero  tariff  differential  subsidy \ncommitment.  The  adjustment  will  be  front  loaded  and  made  effective  by  1 \nJuly 2009, with the remainder to be effective by September 2009. \n\n \nSector debt resolution \n(a)  The  Government  will  establish  a  debt  holding  company  by  30  June  2009  to \nassume  the  debt  liabilities  of  public  power  companies,  which  will  in  turn \nstrengthen the financial position of these companies.  \n\n(b)  The debt holding company will be wholly owned by the Government and will \n\n                                                 \n17 Power sector debt refers to circular debt and debt overhang.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n(iii) \n\nmanage and pay the liabilities through the sale of assets, among other things, \nover the next 5 years. \n\n \nImproved technical and financial performance of public power sector companies. \n(a)  Public power sector companies have outstanding liabilities of PRs142 billion \n(as  of  31  March  2009),  which  are  payable  to  GENCOs,  IPPs  and  fuel \nsuppliers. Of this, the MOF will settle or assist to settle PRs53.5 billion, power \nsector companies will recover PRs27.7 billion from customers, and MOF will \nassist in paying the remaining PRs61 billion in liabilities.  \n\n(b)  Performance contracts will be entered into between MOWP and each of the \npower  companies  effective  1  July  2009  to  promote  corporate  autonomy, \nfinancial independence and improved performance.  \n\n2. \n\n Strengthening Financial Intermediation  \n\n51. \nIn recognition of challenges arising under the current regulatory structure for Pakistan\u2019s \nfinancial  sector  (notably  with  respect  to  the  need  to  strengthen  the  supervision  of  financial \nconglomerates),  the  Government  is  considering  adoption  of  an  alternative  supervisory  model, \nincluding integrated regulation. With ADB support, the Government will be examining the costs \nand  benefits  of  various  regulatory  approaches,  along  with  lessons  learned  from  other \njurisdictions.  Changing  the  regulatory  architecture  is  a  long-term  undertaking\u2014with  human \nresource implications\u2014and needs to be carefully considered.  \n \n52. \nOver  the  shorter  term,  to  improve  regulatory  effectiveness  and  risk  mitigation  in  the \nfinancial sector, the SBP and the SECP have entered into a new memorandum of understanding \nunder  AETP2  to  promote  better  coordination,  information  sharing,  and  supervision  of  financial \nconglomerates. The memorandum provides for setting up task forces comprised of staff from both \nagencies  to  help  mitigate  risks  posed  by  financial  conglomerates  and  to  move  toward  a  more \nharmonized  regulatory  framework,  including  a  risk-based  approach  to  supervising  the  nonbank \nfinancial  sector.  In  addition,  to  address  systemic  risk  concerns  posed  by  NBFCs\u2019  deposit-taking \nactivities,  SECP  has  restricted  their  retail  deposit  taking.  Under  subsequent  subprograms,  the \nSBP  will  undertake  a  self-assessment  of  compliance  with  Basel  core  principles  to  identify  and \naddress ongoing gaps.  \n \n53.  While AETP1 envisaged adoption of a new banking act that incorporates international best \npractices,  in  light  of  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  strengthen  the  overall  supervisory \nframework, and to avoid the need for subsequent legislative revisions, it is more prudent to defer \nlegislative  changes  that  impact  the  supervisory  framework  at  this  time.  ADB  will  continue  to \nmonitor  the  status  of  related  legislative  initiatives,  including  the  new  banking  act.  Subsequent \nsubprograms will include adoption of a blueprint for a new regulatory architecture, preparation of \nrelated draft legislation, and implementation of the new legislation, once adopted. \n \n54. \nUnder AETP2, work continues on the draft deposit protection law and the draft consumer \nprotection  law.  The  draft  deposit  protection  law  is  expected  to  incorporate  international  best \npractice principles on deposit insurance to help ensure the autonomy and financial soundness of \nthe deposit insurer, close coordination with financial sector regulators, and protection of depositors \n(including prompt access to their insured funds).18 The draft consumer protection law is expected \n                                                 \n18 International  best  practice  principles  on  deposit  insurance  have  been  adopted  by  the  International  Association  of \nDeposit Insurers (IADI). The IADI was established in 2002 as a nonprofit organization under Swiss Law, following \ndeliberations  by  the  Financial  Stability  Forum.  Fifty-two  deposit  insurance  organizations  are  IADI  members. \nNotable  principles  provide  that  (i)  a  deposit  insurer  should  be  provided  with  adequate  powers  to  finance \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nto  address  such  issues  as  transparency,  confidentiality,  availability  of  statements,  account \nservicing,  protection  against  fraud,  unfair  contracts  and  lending  practices,  methods  of  debt \ncollection, and arbitrary penalties. Under AETP2, SBP also prepared and adopted new real time \ngross settlement rules. Subsequent subprograms will reflect progress in this area. \n \n55. \nTo  improve  FMU  governance,  under  AETP2,  the  Government  submitted  to  Parliament \namendments to the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Ordinance. The Government has also taken \nother steps to strengthen the financial and operational autonomy of the FMU (providing a one-\nline  budget  allocation  to  the  FMU  for  FY2009/01  and  onwards,  agreeing  to  promptly  release \nallocated funds, and facilitating the hiring of FMU staff). In support of international best practice \nprinciples  for  AML,  Pakistan  is  currently  undergoing  a  mutual  evaluation  of  its  AML  regime.19 \nFindings  and  recommendations  are  expected  to  be  finalized  around  July  2009.  Subsequent \nAETP subprograms will take into account relevant priority actions identified through the mutual \nevaluation to support strengthening the FMU.  \n \n56. \nUnder  AETP2,  ADB  continues  to  support  operationalizing  the  FMU  through  ongoing \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).  The  FMU  has  been  relocated  into  new  offices  accommodating \naround 30 staff. Its staffing has increased from 4 staff (during AETP1 preparation in 2008) to 10. \nThe  FMU  is  in  the  process  of  hiring  11  additional  staff,  including  8  professionals.  Its  workload \ncontinues  to  grow.  In  FY2008,  the  SBP  and  subsequently  the  FMU  received  88  suspicious \ntransaction reports. In FY2009, the FMU has received almost 500 such reports. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  AETP  is  an  integral  part  of  macroeconomic  stabilization  efforts  undertaken  by  the \n57. \nGovernment with IMF support. AETP1 and AETP2 provide resources and inputs for short-term \nstabilization measures while paving the way for economic transformation over the medium term. \nAlthough  the  conceptual  framework  was  designed  within  a  short  time  in  mid-2008,  ADB  has \nprovided  the  Government  with  significant  advisory  support,  which  formed  the  basis  for  the \nProgram.  \n \n58. \nGender inequality continues to be an area of major concern in Pakistan. Limited access \nto income-generating opportunities, together with a range of life cycle risks results in increasing \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ncompensation  payments,  enter  into  contracts,  set  internal  operating  budgets  and  procedures,  and  access  timely \nand  accurate  information  to  ensure  that  it  can  promptly  meet  its  obligations  to  depositors;  (ii)  a  deposit  insurer \nshould  be  operationally  independent,  transparent,  accountable,  and  insulated  from  undue  political  and  industry \ninfluence;  (iii)  a  framework  should  be  in  place  for  close  coordination  and  information-sharing  among  the  deposit \ninsurer  and  other  financial  system  safety  net  participants;  (iv)  a  deposit  insurer  should  be  part  of  the  framework \nwithin the financial system safety net that provides for the early detection and timely intervention and resolution of \ntroubled banks; (v) effective failure-resolution processes should facilitate the ability of the deposit insurer to meet \nits obligations, minimize resolution costs and disruption of markets, maximize recoveries on assets, and reinforce \ndiscipline  through  legal  actions  in  cases  of  negligence  or  other  wrongdoing;  and  (vi)  a  deposit  insurance  system \nshould give depositors prompt access to their insured funds. \n\n19 As part of its commitment to reforms in AML and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), Pakistan is currently \nundertaking a mutual evaluation of its AML/CFT regime. The mutual evaluation (carried out by the World Bank and \nin  conjunction  with  the  Asia/Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering)  is  also  part  of  the  broader  Financial  Sector \nAssessment Program of Pakistan under the World Bank. For the mutual evaluation, Pakistan completed a detailed \nself-assessment questionnaire prior to the visit of the evaluation team in January and February 2009. This involved \na detailed assessment of its compliance with a range of international standards relating to AML and CFT, primarily \nthe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40+9 Recommendations. After the on-site visit, a draft report was prepared \nby the evaluation team for discussion with the Government. With support under the ongoing ADB TA for AML, the \nGovernment provided comments on the report. The mutual evaluation report will be finalized following peer review \nand discussion at the annual meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering in July 2009. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nfeminization  of  poverty.  The  amount  of  $150  million  of  AETP2  will  go  to  the  BISP,  whose \nprimary  recipients  are  female  heads  of  the  family  so  that  women  of  poor  families  can  directly \naccess  and  manage  the  social  safety  net  benefits.  By  the  end  of  AETP3,  7  million  female \nhousehold heads in Pakistan are expected to benefit from BISP.  \n \n59. \nIn addition, BISP will work with NADRA to issue CNICs for women. This is a major step \nforward. ADB's country gender assessment for Pakistan notes that more than 50% of women in \nrural  Pakistan  are  without  CNICs  and  that  this  prevents  women  from  exercising  their  right  to \nvote and run for election and access many government services.20 By receiving CNICs directly, \nwomen  will  have  less  dependency  on  their  male  family  members  to  access  services  and \nopportunities.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n60. \nProgram  Loan. As noted above, the costs associated with AETP2 include increases in \nsubsidies to procure wheat from farmers in 2009 (at a price above the import parity price) and \nexpansion  of  the  BISP  to  cover  at  least  5  million  qualified  families.  The  Government  has \nrequested that AETP2 be designed to provide $500 million before the end of June 2009, which \nis the end of the current fiscal year. For AETP2, two loans are proposed\u2014a loan of $350 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and one of $150 million equivalent from the ADB's \nSpecial  Fund  resources  (ADF).  Subject  to  reform  progress  and  availability  of  resources, \nsubprograms  3  and  4  are  each  envisaged  to  be  $400  million\u2013$500  million.  Thus,  the  overall \namount for the AETP is estimated in the range of $1.8 billion\u2013$2 billion. \n \nThe OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \n61. \nrate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms \nand conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were by its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe ADF loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \n62. \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n63. \nProgram Management. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for \nAETP2.  The  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock;  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power;  SBP; \nand BISP will be the implementing agencies.  \n \nThe  secretary  of  finance  will  steer  AETP2.  The  financial  management  arrangements \n64. \nwithin  MOF  have  been  assessed  as  adequate. 21  MOF\u2019s  accumulated  experience \nin \nimplementing  a  large  number  of  program  loans  demonstrates  its  competence  and  capacity  to \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB.  2008.  Releasing  Women's  Potential  Contribution  to  Inclusive  Economic  Growth.  Country  Gender \n\nAssessment: Pakistan. Manila.  \n\n21  In  connection  with  the  processing  of  AETP2,  MOF  has  been  proactively  instituting  measures  to  address \noutstanding  portfolio  issues  under  other  ADB  programs  and  projects.  Measures  include:  (i)  reconciling  imprest \naccounts; (ii) allocating funds for land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) improving implementation performance \ngenerally.  \n\n \n\n\fcarry out financial management of AETP2 effectively. ADB will monitor program implementation \nclosely to ensure that envisaged outputs and outcomes will be achieved.  \n \n \n65. \nImplementation  Period.  The  implementation  period  for  AETP2  is  from  October  2008 \nthrough  June  2009.  The  loan  of  $500  million  will  become  available  following  satisfaction  of \nAETP2 policy actions and after loan effectiveness. Subsequent subprograms will be processed \nsubject  to  adequate  reforms  progress  and  the  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  the \nreform agenda.  \n \n66. \nProcurement  and  Withdrawal  Procedures.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for \nitems procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 12) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nsimplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans. Loan proceeds \ndisbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the \nvalue  of  the  total  imports  of  Pakistan,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n67. \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to \nAETP. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations. The World Bank is currently working with the BISP to improve fiduciary \ncontrols,  including  financial  management  systems.  To  provide  greater  accountability  and \ntransparency in the flow of funds from the BISP to eligible beneficiaries under the new targeting \nmethod, the BISP has agreed to provide ADB with periodic reports and to post these reports on \nits website.   \n \n68. \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom the proceeds of the OCR loan shall be used first to support the adjustment costs of reforms \nto  be  initiated  and  implemented  under  AETP2,  and  second  to  finance  expenditures  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s  general  development  purposes.  For  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds of the ADF loan, the Government shall establish and maintain a separate account at \nthe  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  to  ensure  that  that  these  funds  are  used  to  support  poor  and \nvulnerable  families  that  qualify  under  the  new  BISP  scorecard  targeting  method.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  ADB  with  periodic  reports  on  the  use  of  these  funds \n(utilization  reports)  for  the  period  from  July  2009  until  full  utilization,  and  to  have  this  account \nand related records audited annually in accordance with standards acceptable to ADB. Certified \ncopies of the audited accounts and financial statements, as well as the auditors\u2019 reports, will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \nProgram  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  economic  reform  units  in \n69. \nMOF and SBP have established and are implementing a performance evaluation system for the \nAETP,  which  includes  a  database  on  the  status  of  policy  measures  and  program  indicators \nbased  on  the  policy  matrix.  They  are  monitoring  implementation  of  the  AETP  and  its  impacts \nand  outcomes.  They  will  be  proactive  in  gathering  data  and  proposing  revisions  as  needed  to \nensure  that  data  compiled  provide  useful  guides  to  management  decision  making  by \npolicymakers. Policy advisors may be placed within MOF and SBP to assist in monitoring and \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nevaluation.  ADB  will  keep  track  of  program  implementation  through  regular  reviews  and \nprogress  reports  throughout  implementation.  Based  on  these  reviews,  modifications  and \nimprovements will be considered. The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 identifies \nthe targets by which attainment of the outputs will be measured. In addition, each subprogram \nwill include a table summarizing overall AETP achievements (Table 4). \n \n\nVI. \n\nSUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n70. \nAETP2  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor  and \nwomen. First, it will help the Government move away from inefficient and untargeted subsidies \nto a targeted safety net program for the poor. The BISP is targeting poor families to protect their \nnutrition intake. Beginning with about 2 million families, the coverage has been extended to at \nleast 5 million eligible families. During AETP3, the BISP will be further expanded to support at \nleast  7  million  families  using  the  new  targeting  methodology.  In  addition,  AETP2  aims  to \nempower women by targeting women heads of poor families as the direct recipients and issuing \nthe national identity card for them, which they can use not only to access BISP benefits but to \nalso  to  open  a  bank  account.  Appendix  6  provides  a  summary  of  the  BISP  and  Appendix  13 \npresents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for AETP2.  \n \n71. \nAn  immediate  outcome  of  AETP2  will  be  to  help  Pakistan  meet  immediate  and  large \nfiscal needs. Moreover, it will help the Government address financial deficits in the power sector \nin a more sustainable manner. This sector\u2019s large circular debt impedes reform much needed to \nresolve the ongoing energy crisis. In parallel, AETP2 will raise public confidence in the banking \nsystem  through  stronger  financial  intermediaries  that  are  better  able  to  mobilize  and  allocate \nresources  and  manage  risks.  AETP2  will  also  enable  ADB  to  sustain  policy  dialogue  on \nstructural  reform  in  sectors  where  it  has  been  actively  involved  through  past  and  current \ninvestments. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n72.  While some of the risks of AETP2 are political and outside of its scope, the financing will \nmitigate a range of others, including the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nInterest  group  resistance.  This  is  likely,  as  those  affected  by  reforms  in  the \nshort  term  may  resist.  The  Government  is  adopting  a  good  communication \nstrategy to articulate the long-term and country-stability interests that are behind \nthe  reforms.  Further,  the  program  cluster  nature  of  the  AETP  ensures  prior \nactions by the Government before financing is provided.   \n\n(ii)  Weak capacity. This is a generic concern, which is elevated in case of complex \nreforms. Adequate design and implementation support is being mobilized through \nTA under AETP1 and under related TA projects that are ongoing. \n\nto \n\nimplement  reforms \n\n(iii)  Weak  fiduciary  controls.  This  is  a  generic  concern  but  is  being  addressed  in \nconnection  with  the  BISP  with  support  from  the  World  Bank.  The  Government \ntransparency  and \nplans \naccountability,  including to  strengthen  financial management  systems  within  the \nBISP. \nGlobal financial crisis. The measures under AETP2 are predicated on a global \nrecovery. While the program cannot influence global events, it can help cushion \nPakistan against some exogenous shocks. \n\nthis  area \n\nimprove \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  risk  of  not  supporting  Pakistan\u2019s  safety  net  programs  and  reducing  inefficient \n73. \nsubsidies  is  also  high.  In  the  absence  of  timely  reforms,  the  Government\u2019s  budget  would \ncontinue  to  be  burdened  by  costly  and  inefficient  subsidies,  leaving  fewer  resources  for \ndevelopment financing, and the financial sector would be vulnerable to systemic risks. High and \npersistent fiscal, current account, and investment deficits could lead to unsustainable levels of \npublic  debt  that  would  adversely  affect  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  environment,  constrain \ninvestment and economic growth, and aggravate poverty. \n \n74. \n\nThe underlying assumptions for AETP2 include   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n \n\nstrong and sustained leadership and commitment to reforms,  \ndevelopment partner coordination, and \nopen dialogue with the private sector and other key stakeholders. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n75. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  under  AETP2,  as  set  forth  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, will be in effect for and beyond \nthe duration of AETP2. \nThe Government will provide ADB  with a report on the utilization of BISP funds \nfor the period October 2008 to April 2009.  \nThe Government will transfer the local currency generated from the ADF loan to \na  separate  BISP  assignment  account  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  Such \nfunds  will  be  used  to  support  poor  and  vulnerable  women  and  families  that \nqualify for cash benefits under the new BISP scorecard targeting method.   \nThe Government will provide ADB with a quarterly utilization report for the period \nbeginning July 2009 until full utilization of the local currency generated from the \nADF  loan  on  the  status  of  payments  under  the  separate  BISP  assignment \naccount  to  qualified  beneficiaries  using  the  new  BISP  scorecard  targeting \nmethod. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  separate  BISP  assignment  account  at  the \nNational Bank of Pakistan and related records be maintained in accordance with \nsound  accounting  principles  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable \nin  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The \nGovernment  will  submit  certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements, and the report of auditors, not later than 6 months after the close of \nthe fiscal year to which they relate.  \nThe Government will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports for the period \nJuly  2009  to  June  2010  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  power  sector \ncircular debt resolution plan. The progress report will include updated information \non  outstanding  payments  owed  by  the  Government  to  power  distribution \ncompanies,  power  distribution  companies  to  NTDC  and  CPPA,  and  NTDC  and \nCPPA to the power generation companies and IPPs.   \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation of AETP2 and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment \non any resulting policy proposals. The Government will take into account ADB\u2019s \nviews before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \n\nto  ADB \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nVIII.

Most  of  the  sources  of  fiscal \ninstability for FY2008 have been addressed. Federal subsidies for oil and power have already \nbeen substantially reduced, and further increases to put tariffs at cost-recovery levels are set for \nthe very near term. Wheat subsidies, which equaled 0.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \nFY2008,  covered  high-cost  imports  late  in  the season  as a  result  of  general  mismanagement. \nThe  2009  harvest  is  a  bumper  crop,  and  imports  will  be  unnecessary  for  FY2010.  Interest \npayments will remain high into 2010, as these reflect amounts due on obligations contracted in \nthe 1990s. Current reforms are focusing on ways to achieve a sustained increase in revenues. \n\n2. \nSummary  of  the  FY2008  Fiscal  Crisis.  Surges  in  commodity  prices,  coupled  with \nunsustainable subsidy policies and a general stagnation of tax revenues, contributed to a sharp \ndeterioration  in  the  fiscal  balance  from  the  overall  deficit  equal  to  4.3%  of  GDP  posted  for \nFY2007  to  7.4%  for  FY2008.  Concurrently,  previously  ample  capital  inflows  deteriorated,  and \nthe lack of commensurate reductions in development spending contributed to a deterioration of \nPakistan\u2019s  external  position  as  reserves  declined  to  less  than  1  month  of  imports.  Since \nNovember  2008,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  address  causes  of  the  macroeconomic \nimbalances and return to a path consistent with the 4% fiscal deficit limit implied by Pakistan\u2019s \nFiscal Responsibility Law (2005). This note summarizes key aspects of the fiscal challenge and \nmeasures taken since November 2008.  \n\n3. \nContext.  The  sharp  deterioration  in  FY2008  followed  on  the  heels  of  substantial \nimprovements in the fiscal balance. From 2001, the Government undertook a range of policies \nto  contain  expenditures  and  improve  revenues  as  part  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nPlan approved by the IMF and the World Bank, and by FY2004 the fiscal deficit had declined to \n2.4%  of  GDP.  Robust  capital  inflows  provided  room  for  Pakistan  to  undertake  increased \ndevelopment spending while narrowly improving the internal fiscal balance. The fiscal balance \ndeteriorated somewhat in FY2006 and FY2007 to 4.3% of GDP in response to additional public \nspending following the October 2005 earthquake and a surge in interest payments.  \n\nTable 1:  Summary of Fiscal Position (% of GDP) \n\n Item \n2004/05 \n13.8 \nTotal Revenue \n10.1 \n     Tax Revenue \n3.7 \n     Nontax Revenue \n17.2 \nTotal Expenditure  \n13.3 \n    Current Expenditure \n3.4 \n         Without Interest \n3.9 \n    Development Expenditure \nFiscal Deficit \n{4.3} \n3.3 \nSources:  Economic  Affairs  Wing,  Finance  Division,  Government  of  Pakistan.  2008.

During  FY2008,  subsidy  outlays \nexceeded budget allocations by 2.8% of GDP, accounting for 37.7% of the 3% of \nGDP  increase  in  the  overall  deficit.  The  unprecedented  increase  in  oil  prices \ndrove subsidies far above the budget allocation of PRs15 billion to PRs175 billion \n(1.7%  of  GDP),  as  price  increases  were  not  passed  along  to  consumers.  The \npower  subsidy  roughly  doubled  from  the  budget  allocation  of  PRs73  billion  to \nPRs133 billion. The subsidy on wheat supplied at concessional rates through the \nutility  supply  stores  amounted  to  about  PRs40  billion\u2014and  this  had  no \ncorresponding  budget  allocation.  Fertilizer  subsidies  for  FY2008  amounted  to \nPRs30 billion, more than double the budget allocation. \n\nFigure A2.1: Budgeted versus Actual Subsidies for 2007/08 \n(PRs billion)\n\n175.0\n\n133.3\n\n72.5\n\n15.0\n\n13.5\n\n40.0\n\n29.5\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nBudgeted Subsidies\nPower\n\nOil\n\nActual Subsidies\n\nFertilizer\n\nWheat\n\nSources:  Government  of  Pakistan,  Finance  Division.  2007.

Interest payments on the public debt rose by \nmore  than  49%  in  FY2007  on  the  back  of  lumpy  payments  made  on  maturing \nDefense Savings Certificates issued in the late 1990s. Taken as a share of GDP, \ninterest  payments  rose  from  3.1%  in  FY2006  to  4.8%  for  FY2008.  During \nFY2008,  these  interest  obligations  increased  further  to  PRs490  billion\u2014about \n18%  higher  than  budgeted  amounts.  Payments  for  FY2009  are  expected  to  be \n4.8% of GDP and to remain at about that level for FY2010, placing considerable \npressure  on  the  budget.  A  growing  level  of  debt  also  contributed  to  increased \ninterest  payments,  as  total  public  debt  grew  by  10%  in  FY2007  and  16%  for \nFY2008 in response to expanding fiscal and current account deficits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n619.0\n\n490.0\n\n387.1\n\nFigure A2.2:  Interest Payments (PRs billion)\n\n273.9\n\n235.3\n\n226.3\n\n219.7\n\n260.0\n\n2001/02  2002/03 2003/04  2004/05 2005/06 2006/07\n\n2007/08 2008/09*\n\nSources:  Economic  Affairs  Wing.

Article  IV  Consultation  and  First  Review  Under  the \nStand-by Arrangement\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n\n  \n\n \n5. \nTax Revenue Slippage. Part of the fiscal deficit increase in FY2008 can be attributed to \nsluggish  revenue  performance.  The  Federal  Board  of  Revenue\u2019s  collections  had  increased \ngradually to about 9.7% of GDP and were expected to reach 10.3% for FY2008. Instead, owing \nin part to a slowing economy and a decline in corporate profitability, collections came in about \n0.7%  of  GDP  lower  than  budgeted.  It  is  expected  that  tax  revenue  collections  will  be  about \nunchanged as a share of GDP for FY2009, as higher than expected revenue from the petroleum \ndevelopment levy partially offset lower than expected collection of sales tax revenue on imports. \nThe authorities are considering a range of measures for FY2010. \n \n6. \nFinancing  the  Deficit.  Large  external  capital  inflows  between  FY2005  and  FY2007 \nfinanced  nearly  half  of  the  fiscal  deficit,  limiting  the  extent  to  which  the  Government  relied  on \ndomestic  bank  and  nonbank  institutions.  External  inflows  dropped  precipitously  in  FY2008, \nfinancing  only  about  17%  of  the  deficit,  and  the  Government  relied  on  the  banking  system  to \nfinance 83% of the deficit. Much of that was financed by borrowing from the SBP. SBP claims \non  the  Government  for  budget  support  climbed  from  PRs339  billion  at  the  end  of  FY2007  to \nPRs1,274 by November 2008. Alternatively, budget support to the Government increased from \n3.2% of broad money at the end of FY2007 to 12.5% of broad money at the end FY2008. The \nSBP  financing  for  budget  support  was  restricted  to  the  stock  target  agreed  to  under  the \nInternational Monetary Fund Stand-by Agreement. As treasury bill rates rose in concert with a \n250-basis  point  increase  in  the  SBP\u2019s  discount  rate,  these  securities  became  attractive  to \nbanks.  Most  treasury  auctions  have  been  oversubscribed,  with  a  wide  range  of  banks \nparticipating. \n\n7. \nProspects for FY2010. Strains on the fiscal deficit for FY2009 have been reduced. The \nreduction  in  international  commodity  prices  (especially  for  wheat  and  oil)  will  generate \nconsiderable fiscal space. Additional factors important for the 2010 fiscal outlook include:  \n\n(i) \n\nMeasures  will  be  introduced  for  FY2010  to  strengthen  revenue  collections, \nincluding improvements to both policies and administration. \n\n1,600\n\n1,400\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  has  undertaken  a  rationalization  and  review  of  development \nspending.  \nThe  fiscal  space  generated  by  recent  policy  changes  has  to  be  viewed  in  the \ncontext  of  substantially  increased  risk  to  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  performance \nappearing  in  recent  months.  Social  safety  net  requirements  can  be  expected  to \nexpand  considerably.  Not  only  has  unemployment  increased,  but  a  substantial \nnumber of citizens have been displaced as a result of intensified internal conflict. \nSecurity and defense spending will necessarily rise. Real growth could be further \nreduced,  particularly  if  intensified  conflict  substantially  impacts  on  agricultural \nactivity. \nThe donor meeting in April 2009 resulted in commitments for additional support \nto shore up development activity and to reflect the increase in social support that \nwill be needed. The original deficit target for FY2010 of 3.4% has been loosened \nto accommodate up to 1.2% of GDP in additional donor support. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nGOVERNMENT\u2019S DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE PAKISTAN ACCELERATING ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM \nSUBPROGRAM 2 \n \n\nImpact: Sustained high economic growth  \n \nOutcome: Macroeconomic stability  \n \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram 1 Activities \n\nSubprogram 2 (June 2009) \nActivities \n\nSubprogram 3 (June 2010) \nIndicative Activities \n\nSafety net cover for up to 5 million \npoor  families  provided  for  through \nallocation  of  PRs41  billion \nin \nFY2009 budgeta \n \nClear \nfor \nselecting  beneficiaries  of  cash \nthe  Benazir \ntransfers \nIncome Support Program (BISP)  \n\nOutput 1: Immediate distortions removed to initiate structural transformation \nOutput 1.1: Targeted safety nets designed and rolled out for the poor and vulnerable households  \nSocial  impact  of  food  and \nfuel  inflationary  pressures \nmitigated  through  targeted \nsafety net programs \n\nFY2010  budget  for  the  BISP \nincreased \nincome \nsupport  for  at  least  5  million \nfamiliesb  \n \nBISP  operationalized  with \n(i) \ncentral  and  provincial  offices \nestablished,  and  (ii)  improved \ntargeting \nfor \nbeneficiaries piloted \nOutput 1.2: Market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management in place \nWheat  subsidies  reduced \nand  eliminated  and  wheat \nprocurement \nmade \ncompetitive \n\nto  provide \n\ndeveloped \n\nthrough \n\nsystem \n\ncriteria \n\n \n\nFY2011 budget allocation for \nBISP  increased  to  provide \nincome support for at least 7 \nmillion families  \n \nBISP\u2019s \nfiduciary  structure \nstrengthened  and  improved \nsystem \ntargeting \nimplemented \n\nImplementation \naction plan \n\nof  ECC \n\n(ECC) \n\nEconomic \n\nTime-bound  action  plan  adopted \nCoordination \nby \nfor  market-\nCommittee \nbased \nreserve \nmanagement (ECC action plan)c \nSupport  price  of  wheat  for  farmers \nincreased \nto \nPRs650 \n\nfrom  PRs425d \n\npricing \n\nand \n\n \n \n \n \n\nECC  endorsed  implementation \nof  a  formula-based  system  for \nsetting (i) wheat support price for \n2009  and  beyond  based  on  (a) \ncosts  of  production,  (b)  regional \nprices,  (c)  import  and  export \nparity  prices,  and  (d)  domestic \nand  global  market  conditions; \nand  (ii)  wheat  issue  price  to \nreflect all related costs \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nSubprogram 1 Activities \n\nSubprogram 2 (June 2009) \nActivities \nOutput 1.3: Electricity subsidies funded and power sector debt resolution initiated \nPast \nincluding \nelectricity  subsidies,  settled \nand  debt  restructuring  plan \nimplemented \n\nliabilities, \n\nsector \n\nplan \n\nowed \n\ncircular  debt \nPower \n(PSDRP) \nresolution \nprepared  and \nimplementation \ncommenced.

The Government allocated PRs34 billion for FY2009, targeting 3.5 million families. This \nwas the third-largest allocation in the budget and constituted 0.3% of GDP.  \n \n2. \nBISP  provides  cash  transfers  of  PRs1,000  per  month  to  the  female  head  of  eligible \nfamilies  whose  monthly  income  is  less  than  PRs6,000  per  month.  This  amount  has  been \nestimated as sufficient to finance 20\u201325 days of flour needs for a 5\u20136 member family.  \n \n3. \nThe different tasks under the BISP are functionally separated to guard against misuse of \nfunds.  The  BISP  is  responsible  for  management  of  the  program.  It  decides  on  the  policies \n(including targeting criteria), prepares regulations and manuals, and monitors implementation. In \norder  to  quickly  launch  the  program,  parliamentarians  were  asked  to  identify  beneficiary \nfamilies.  The  services  of  the  National  Database  Registration  Authority  (NADRA)  have  been \nhired  by  BISP  to  verify  eligibility  of  the  selected  families  based  on  specified  criteria.  NADRA \nsends the list of eligible families to BISP to calculate the payments due and to the Pakistan Post \nto deliver the payments. Pakistan Post has been contracted by the BISP to deliver the payment \nthrough money orders to the adult female in the household every alternate month.   \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAs  discussed  above,  key  BISP  functions,  such  as  targeting,  operation,  payments,  and \ncontrols,  are  carried  out  by  separate  actors  to  allow  for  checks  and  balances.  This  requires  a \nstrong central unit to coordinate the program. \n \n5. \nStrategic  and  Management  Level.  The  BISP  is  governed  by  a  management  board \nheaded by the BISP chairperson, who is appointed by the President of Pakistan upon advice of \nthe Prime Minister. The BISP board is responsible for design and implementation of the BISP. \nCurrently, the management board is composed of five members of the National Assembly, the \ndeputy  chairman  of  the  Planning  Commission,  and  BISP\u2019s  managing  director.  However,  the \nrecently  approved  Benazir  Income  Support  Program  Ordinance,  2009  expands  the  number  of \nboard  members  to  not  less  than  nine  nor  more  than  11,  half  of  which  should  be  from  the \nGovernment and half from nongovernment organizations.  \n \n6. \nOperational  Level.  The  managing  director  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  operations  of \nthe BISP and is supported by three departments: (i) the Operations Department liaises with the \nregional  units  in  each  province;  (ii)  the  Administration  Department  is  responsible  for \nadministrative  matters,  media  contacts,  and  information  technology;  and  (iii)  the  Finance  and \nAccounts Department is responsible for the fiduciary aspects of BISP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFigure A6.1: Organizational Structure of BISP Headquarters \n \n\nChairperson\n(Federal Minister)\n\nBoard\n\n \n\nM.D\n\nP.S\nP.A\nP.A\nQ\nN.Q\nDr.\n\nJS \nOperations\n\nJS \nAdministration\n\nJS/FA\nFinance & Accounts\n\nDirector\nPunjab/\nISL\n\nDirector\nSindh\n\nDirector\nBaloch\n\nDirector\nAJK/NA\n\nIT \nOfficer\n\nDS\nAdmin-I\n\nDS\nAdmin-II\n\nDS\nF&A\n\nDirector\nNWFP/\nFATA\n\nAsst . \nOfficer (IT)\n(2)\n\nPS= 1\nPA=12\nAsst.=8\nNQ=8\nS.G=3\nSwep=2\nDR=1\nPMO=1\nReP=2\nDri=11\nR & I\nAsst=3\nN.Q=1\n\nDS\nI/A\n\nA/O\n\nA/O/\nCashier\n\nMedia \nLiaison \nOfficer\n\nAsst.\nMedia \nLiaison \nOfficer\n\nMedia \nAssistant\n\nA/A\n\nA/A\n\n \n\nTo  date, \n\nthe  managing  director  and \n\nSource: http://www.bisp.gov.pk/benazir/organization-chart.jsp. \n \n7. \nthe  directors  general  of  operations  and \nadministration have been appointed. The position of director general for finance and accounts is \nvacant. In addition, 83 other staff have been appointed.  \n \n8. \nAccounting  and  Financing.  The  institutional  arrangements  and  governance  structure \nof the BISP will be defined under implementing regulations to the new ordinance and are in the \nprocess  of  being  drafted.  Comprehensive  accounting  and  finance  guidelines  are  being \ndeveloped.  These  will  incorporate  a  robust  internal  control  framework  and  ensure  adequate \nsegregation of duties. The finance and accounts guidelines will also provide the minimum staff \nand  capacity  required.  Additional  staff  will  be  needed  to  effectively  address  the  anticipated \nnature  and  scale  of  operations  and  satisfactorily  manage  accounting  and  financial  reporting \nfunctions once the entity fully commences operations and subnational formations are functional. \nAn  accounting  and  financial  reporting  module  will  form  part  of  the  entity\u2019s  management \ninformation system (MIS). \n \n9. \nAn  internal  audit  unit  has  also  been  created.  Currently,  the  unit  is  reporting  to  the \ndirector  general  for  finance  and  accounts.  To  ensure  independence  and  enhance  the  control \nenvironment,  the  unit  will  be  placed  under  the  administrative  control  of  the  managing  director. \nAll  internal  audit  reports  will  be  presented  to  the  management  board  for  discussion  and \nappropriate action. An internal audit policy has been drafted and is under internal review. Staff \nin  internal  audit  will  need  to  be  trained  to  ensure  that  the  internal  audit  work  program  can  be \neffectively implemented.  \n \n10. \nOperations.  BISP  has  five  regional  offices.  Each  regional  office  is  managed  by  a \ndirector  general.  The  regional  offices  are  small,  but  they  can  be  expanded  if  needed.  Each \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n45 \n\nregional office has a number of divisional offices covering zones within the region. There will be \n28 divisional offices in total, each headed by a zonal director and assisted by supervisors, 125 \nin total for all divisional offices. So far, all provincial offices have been set up and most of the \ndirector general and director positions have been filled. Other staff still must be appointed as the \nBISP  rolls  out  its  operation.  A  total  of  16  directors  have  been  appointed,  including  directors \ngeneral. The divisional offices are still being established.  \n \n11. \nThe main function of the divisional offices is to redress grievances. A website has been \ncreated  where  individual  applications  and  benefit  payment  status  can  be  tracked.  As  it  is \nunlikely  that  many  targeted  individuals  have  internet  access,  constituents  thus  submit  their \ngrievances  through  their  parliamentarians.  An  MIS  is  under  preparation  which  will  provide \ndivisional offices with access to updated applications and payment status of the applicants and \nbeneficiaries.  A  toll-free  number  will  be  launched  to  submit  grievances  once  the  MIS  is \noperational. Moving grievance redress down to the grassroots level is a priority going forward.   \n \n12. \nFlow of Funds. As set forth in the BISP Income Support Program Ordinance, 2009, the \nBISP prepares an annual budget estimate for the program. The Ministry of Finance reviews and \npresents  a  budget  before  Parliament  that  includes  the  annual  BISP  budget.  Periodically,  the \nBISP  updates  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on  its  budget  requirements  (in  light  of  qualified \nbeneficiaries).  Based  on  the  update,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  advises  the  Accountant  General \nPakistan to release the funds needed into BISP\u2019s assignment account with the National Bank of \nPakistan.  BISP  receives  the  list  of  eligible  families  from  NADRA,  which  is  also  forwarded  to \nPakistan Post. BISP calculates the amount owed. The managing director of BISP approves the \namount  for  release  to  Pakistan  Post  and  issues  a  check.  Pakistan  Post  then  delivers  money \norders  to  eligible  families  and  prepares  payment  information  (status  of  money  order  for  each \nbeneficiary,  whether  it  was  delivered  or  not,  cumulative  figures).  After  30  days,  Pakistan  Post \nprepares reconciliation. \n \n\nTable 6.1: BISP Budget Information (as of 30 April 2009) \n\n  \n\nDescription \n\nBudget allocation for FY 2008/09 \nAmount disbursed by BISP for \n\nAmount  \n(PRs million) \n\n34,000\n\nBenefit payments (including Pakistan Post service chargesa) \nBISP administrative costs \nNational Database and Registration Authority \nPilot poverty score card survey in 16 districts (PPAF/RSPN/PCO) \n\n10,972\n118\n123\n173\nPPAF = Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund; PCO = Population Census Organization; RSPN = Rural Support Program \nNetwork. \na  Pakistan Post will receive PRs25 per money order, the postman will receive PRs5 per money order. \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program.  \n \n13. \nAt  the  current  pace,  around  half  of  the  allocated  PRs34  billion  will  be  disbursed  by  30 \nJune  2009. More  than  95%  of  the  disbursements  are  funding  benefit  payments,  meaning  less \nthan 5% of the resources are used to cover administrative costs and service delivery (including \ncosts of the pilot project to prepare a new targeting method). \n \nfederal \n14. \nparliamentarians  (members  of  National  Assembly  and  senators)  were  asked  to  identify \nbeneficiary families. The rationale is that parliamentarians are accountable to their electorates. \n\nSelection  of  Beneficiaries. \n\nthe  BISP, \n\nto  quickly \n\nIn  order \n\nlaunch \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nAll  parliamentarians,  irrespective  of  party  affiliation,  have  been  provided  with  an  equal \nopportunity  to  recommend  eligible  families.  Each  politician  received  8,000  forms  to  be \ndistributed  based  on  13  criteria  to  the  poor  and  needy  in  his  or  her  constituency. 1  The \ncompleted  forms  were  sent  directly  to  NADRA.  This  selection  process  was  closed  on  28 \nFebruary 2009. Forms submitted after this date have been discarded.  \n \n\nTable 6.2: Status of Forms Processing (as of 30 April 2009) \n \n\n73.5 \n\nPercentage \n100 \n\nTotal Number \n3,500,000 \n3,085,919 \n\nDescription \nNumber of forms distributed to Parliamentarians \nNumber  of  completed  forms  submitted  by  Parliamentarians \nto NADRA \nNADRA = National Database and Registration Authority. \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program. \n \n15. \nIn  December  2008,  the  Government  decided  to  improve  BISP  targeting  through  the \nadoption of a poverty scorecard based on a so-called \u201cproxy means testing\u201d approach. The use of \nthe poverty scorecard will be pilot tested in 16 districts. Three organizations have been contracted \nto  conduct  the  pilot  test:  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  (PPAF),  Rural  Support  Program \nNetwork  (RSPN),  and  Population  Census  Organization  (PCO).  The  PPAF  and  RSPN  are  well \nestablished in the rural areas, and the PCO has a broad network of offices throughout the country. \nThe  BISP  has  established  clear  criteria  for  evaluating  their  performance  before  selecting  the \norganizations for the nationwide rollout of the poverty scorecard survey. The pilot began in May \n2009 and is expected to be completed in 2\u20133 months. \n \n16. \nThis test phase will provide useful insights and the necessary learning for scaling up the \nprogram  nationwide,  including  to  make  improvements  in  the  enrollment,  payment,  grievance \nand appeals, and monitoring and evaluation processes.  \n \n17. \nRecipient  Verification.  NADRA  has  been  contracted  to  verify  targeted  beneficiaries \nunder  the  BISP.  NADRA  receives  the  prescribed  forms  from  the  parliamentarians  and  verifies \nthem electronically by applying certain filters. It is not able to check on one of the key criteria, \nwhich  is  money  income.  Two  weeks  are  allotted  to  process  the  forms.  The  list  of  eligible \nbeneficiaries  is  passed  on  electronically  to  Pakistan  Post  for  payment.  The  list  of  ineligible \nbeneficiaries (those who do not meet all eligibility criteria) is returned to BISP for closure. The \nlist of rejections (due to discrepancies in the forms) is returned to BISP and the applicants for \nrectification. In addition, NADRA rejects people in cases of fraud or duplication. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The  criteria  for  a  family's  eligibility  for  benefits  under  the  BISP  are  as  follow:  (i)  possession  of  a  computerized \nnational  identification  card  (CNIC)  by  the  female  applicant;  and  (ii)  monthly  income  is  less  than  PRs6,000; \n(iii) widowed  or  divorced  women,  without  adult  male  in  the  family;  or  (iv)  any  physically  or  mentally  retarded \nperson(s) in the family; or (v) any family member suffering from a chronic disease. The following families will not be \neligible: (vi) where any member of the family is in the employment of a government or semi-government authority \nor  department  or  the  armed  forces;  (vii)  where  any  member  of  the  household  is  drawing  a  pension  from  a \ngovernment  or  semi-government  authority  or  department  or  the  armed  forces;  (viii)  where  any  member  of  the \nhousehold is receiving any post-retirement benefits from any department or agency; (ix) where any member of the \nfamily owns agriculture land of more than 3 acres or a residential house or plot of more than eight square yards (3 \nmarlas); (x)  where any member of the  family is receiving income support from any other sources; (xi)  where any \nmember of the family possesses a machine readable passport; (xii) where any member of the family possesses a \nnational identity card for overseas pakistanis; (xiii) where any member of the family has a bank account (except at \nNBP, HBL, UBL, MCB, ABL, BOP, Bolan Bank, Khyber Bank, First Women's Bank, Zarai Tarakyati Bank, Khushali \nBank, and all microfinance banks). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n47 \n\nTable 6.3: Number of Beneficiaries  Verified by NADRA (as of 30 April 2009)  \n \nTotal Eligible \n\n819,583 \n469,642 \n343,628 \n112,800 \n55,627 \n1,801,280 \n\nTotal Rejected \n441,119 \n193,809 \n106,247 \n81,399 \n35,388 \n857,962 \n\nTotal Ineligible \n285,935 \n44,699 \n59,672 \n20,635 \n15,736 \n426,677 \n\nTotal Received \n1,546,637 \n708,150 \n509,547 \n214,834 \n106,751 \n3,085,919 \n\nProvince \nPunjab \nSindh \nNWFP \nBalochistan \nFATA \n    Total \nFATA = Federal Administered Tribal Areas;  NWFP = NorthWest Frontier Province.  \nSource: Benazir Income Support Program. \n \n18. \nOne of the  eligibility criteria is that a female member of the family apply as the named \napplicant.  She  needs  to  have  a  computerized  national  identification  card  (CNIC).  The  NADRA \nnetwork  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  the  FATA  region,  is  incomplete  but  is  being  expanded  as \nthe BISP extends coverage. As of October 2008, 67.3 million CNICs had been issued out of an \neligible  adult  population  of  85.5  million.  Since  the  introduction  of  BISP,  NADRA  has  issued  a \ntotal of 2 million new CNIC cards to women. The issuance has potentially a strong emancipatory \nimpact, as the possession of a CNIC is required for most business activities, such as opening a \nbank account, obtaining a telephone connection, and for any government application. \n \n19. \nDisbursement. Pakistan Post has a network of 12,343 post offices that can help reach \nBISP  beneficiaries.  Payments  are  delivered  at  home  without  collection  cost  for  the  recipient. \nPakistan  Post  has  agreed  to  provide  BISP  with  computerized  payment  information  and  a \nreconciliation  of  financial  transactions  within  the  subsequent  month  after  completion  of  the \ndisbursement cycle. In case of abuse (when a postal delivery person asks for a fee), sanctions \nwill  be  imposed.  Pakistan  Post  has  its  own  institutionalized  mechanism  based  on  its  internal \nmonitoring  cell  for  reconciliation,  random  checking,  and  reporting.  So  far,  11  postal  delivery \npersons  have  been  sanctioned  for  mishandling  the  payment  delivery.  The  Postal  Department \nhas also taken administrative action against officials as well as officers.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nWHEAT MARKETING REFORMS \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nUnder the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program, the Government committed \n1. \nto a market-based wheat pricing and efficient reserve management system. This involves wheat \nmarketing  reforms  regarding  the  producer  procurement  price  and  wheat  issue  price  to  flour \nmillers, as well as a reduction in the scale of procurement undertaken by government agencies \nfor  the  within-year  operational  reserves  and  for  inter-year  strategic  reserves.  Given  an \nanticipated expansion in the private sector\u2019s role in marketing, the Government also committed \nto undertake the sale of surplus storage facilities.  \n \nThe  approach  approved  by  the  Government\u2019s  Economic  Coordination  Committee  (30 \n2. \nSeptember 2008) was incremental, reflecting the need to maintain price stability for producers \nand  consumers  until  new  government  safety  net  programs  become  fully  operational  that  are \nbetter targeted and more efficient. A key new program is the Benazir Income Support Program \n(BISP), which will provide income support to 7 million poor and low-income families by 2010.  \n \n3. \nThe  existing  wheat  marketing  support  measures  have  involved  government  subsidies \n(federal  and  provincial)  to  support  wheat  producers  and  consumers  that  include  significant \nsubsidy  transfers  to  flour  millers.  The  interventions,  while  providing  some  price  stability,  have \nnot  been  efficient  or  well  targeted  in  terms  of  reaching  their  intended  beneficiaries.  While  the \nwheat  subsidy  was  only  0.3%  of  GDP  in  FY2008,  it  is  still  significant  in  terms  of  government \nexpenditure (accounting for approximately PRs40 billion). \n \nB. \n\nWheat Economy \n\n4. \nWheat  Marketing  System.  Wheat  is  the  staple  food  in  Pakistan,  and,  given  the  large \npopulation of poor and low-income earners (small-scale producers and consumers), wheat price \nstabilization has been a long-term government policy objective. The Government has adopted a \nnumber of interventions involving \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\na  wheat  procurement  price  (set  by  the  Government  for  purchase  from \nproducers); \nwheat  procurement  targets  for  the  Pakistan  Agricultural  Storage  and  Supplies \nCorporation,  or  PASSCO,  and  the  provincial  food  departments  (with  Punjab \naccounting for approximately 80% of the country\u2019s production);  \na  wheat  issue  price  for  sale  of  procured  wheat  to  flour  millers  (usually  at  less \nthan  the  costs  of  procurement  plus  storage,  handling,  and  transport,  it  is  quota \nbased); and  \ncontrols  on  wheat  movement,  with  import  and  export  controls  (tariffs  and \nprohibitions)  depending  on  the  country\u2019s  production  level,  and  domestically \ninterprovincial restrictions on movement until provincial targets are achieved. \n\n \n5. \nIn an average season, the country\u2019s production is around 21 million tons, of which about \n60% is retained while the remaining 40% (i.e., 8 million to 9 million tons) enters the market. In \nterms of demand, procurement is undertaken by government agencies, flour millers, and traders \n(some  of  which  is  for  illegal  export).  For  2009,  production  is  forecast  at  25  million  tons.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  agenda  calls  for  increasing  wheat  production,  with  a  target  of  30  million \ntons by 2015. To achieve this through productivity improvements would require a large program \nproviding farmers improved access to quality inputs, finance, water, and technical services.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n49 \n\nIn  a  market-based  wheat  producing  economy,  the  wheat  price  will  range  between  the \n6. \nimport and export parity price, depending on the level of production and whether the country is \nexporting or importing in that year, and with adjustments for associated transport and handling \ncharges.  The  export  parity  price  is  lower,  with  the  difference  being  the  cargo  or  freight  cost \n(international  to  port  for  imports)  and  the  transport  and  handling  costs  from  farm  to  port  (for \nexports).  \n \n7. \nIn Pakistan over the period 2005\u20132007, the domestic price was akin to the export parity \nprice, as over this period crop production was good and export was undertaken at some level \n(see Table 1). The exception was the period of high fluctuating prices during 2007\u20132008. Given \ngovernment interventions into the wheat market in Pakistan, the link between international price \nchanges and movement in domestic prices is at times distorted.  \n \n\nTable A7.1:  Wheat Production and Trade \n('000 tons) \n\nImports \n\nExports \n\nConsumption \nYear \n2000\u20132001 \n2001\u20132002 \n2002\u20132003 \n2003\u20132004 \n2004\u20132005 \n2005\u20132006 \n2006\u20132007 \n2007\u20132008 \n\nProduction \n19,024 \n18,226 \n19,183 \n19,500 \n21,612 \n21,277 \n23,295 \n20,959 \n\n80 \n267 \n148 \n108 \n427 \n816 \n136 \n1,820 \n\nDomestic \nProcurement \n8,582 \n4,081 \n4,045 \n3,514 \n3,939 \n4,514 \n4,422 \n3,918 \n\nReleases \n5,537 \n3,376 \n5,130 \n4,104 \n4,500 \n2,088 \n6,003 \n6,320 \n\n \n \n649 \n1,140 \n43 \n \n \n \n\nNote: Export numbers are official exports, and do not include informal sales and exports to Afghanistan. \nSource:  Official Government of Pakistan Statistics (MINFAL, Federal Bureau of Statistics). \n \nThe  existing  government  procedure  for  setting  the  procurement  price  involves  the \n8. \nAgricultural  Policy  Institute  (API)  under  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock \nundertaking  a  wheat  market  analysis.  This  involves  assessing  the  following  factors:  domestic \nsupply,  demand,  stocks,  and  price;  cost  of  production,  comparative  economics  of  competing \ncrops,  fertilizer  costs,  nominal  and real  prices, and  world market  supply  and  demand;  and  the \ndomestic parity price and import and export parity prices.  \n \n9. \nWhile  the  API  analyses  a  range  of  factors,  its  report  does  not  make  a  specific  price \nrecommendation. API does not use a structured methodology with weightings for the key factors \ndetermining  price,  such  as  forecast  international  prices  and  the  cost  of  production.  Under  the \ncurrent  system,  it  appears  that  the  dominant  determining  factor  is  cost  of  production.  The \nanalysis  is  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock,  which  prepares  a \nrecommendation on the wheat procurement price that is then submitted to the ECC. The ECC \nmakes  the  final  decision  on  the  procurement  price.  The  procurement  price  movements  over \n2007\u20132009  and  associated  impacts  on  supply  and  procurement  indicate  the  risks  associated \nwith the current procedure when international wheat prices are fluctuating. To reduce the risk of \nthe wheat procurement price\u2019s being distortionary and to set the price at a level that is above the \nmarket  price,  a  more  structured  price  setting  methodology  is  needed.  Such  a  methodology \nshould require a more thorough assessment of international forecast wheat prices.  \n \nThe  level  of  wheat  stocks  and  reserves  tend  to  be  country-pecific  and  is  influenced  by \n10. \ndomestic  policy  and  assessment  of  potential  risks.  Pakistan  does  keep  large  national  stocks  in \nrelation to its policy of assisting to stabilize prices, which results in high costs to the Government. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nDuring  2001\u20132007,  levels  were  approximately  19%  of  production  (Table  2).  In  comparison, \nnational  stocks  in  India  over  the  same  period  were  about  23%,  which  is  high  relative  to  other \ncountries in South Asia. For India, it reflects the country\u2019s large demand given its population and \nthe impact that increased Indian wheat import requirements would have on the world price. That is \nnot a factor for Pakistan. For 2009, the Indian procurement price is equivalent to PRs750 per 40 \nkilograms  (kg).  (Price  comparison  between  the  two  countries  may  not  reflect  the  wheat  quality \ndifference between them.) By contrast, Bangladesh operates with substantially lower stock levels.  \n \nImpact  of  Wheat  Prices  in  2007  and  2008.  During  2007  and  2008,  wheat  prices \n11. \nincreased  rapidly.  In  Pakistan,  this  price  volatility  impacted  on  households\u2019  capacity  to  access \nand purchase wheat. This, in turn, led to social unrest. The announced 2008 procurement price \nwas  less  than  the  market  price  (export  parity  price),  and  during  the  2008  season  the \nGovernment had to raise the procurement price to PRs625 per 40 kg. Initially, exports had been \nundertaken in 2008. Later in the year, to meet consumer needs, Pakistan had to import wheat \n(1.8 million tons) at a much higher price, which was then sold at a lower price to domestic flour \nmillers. It is estimated this subsidy cost PRs40 billion. Trying to meet this domestic demand, the \nGovernment  banned  exports  and  producing  provinces  imposed  interprovincial  restrictions  to \ncontrol supply and movement and to achieve required targets.  \n \n\nTable A7.2:  Wheat Procurement and Issue Price \n\nProcurement \nPrice \n(PRs/40 kg) \n \n300 \n300 \n350 \n400 \n415 \n625 \n625 \n950 \n\nYear \n \n2000\u20132001 \n2002\u20132003 \n2003\u20132004 \n2004\u20132005 \n2005\u20132006 \n2006\u20132007 \n2007\u20132008 \n2008\u20132009 \n\nSep\u2013Oct \n330 \n330 \n330 \n380 \n\n \nIssue Price \n\nNov\u2013Dec \n335 \n335 \n335 \n380 \n\nJan\u2013Feb \n340 \n340 \n340 \n392 \n\nMar\u2013Apr \n345 \n345 \n345 \n398 \n\n425 \n430 \n625 \nTBD \n\nin  2009. \n\nkg = kilogram; TBD = to be determined. \nSource: Official Government of Pakistan Statistics (MINFAL). \n \n12.  Wheat  Prices \nIn  September  2008,  the  Government  announced  the \nprocurement price (support price) for the 2009 crop of PRs950 per 40 kg. The crop is harvested \nfrom March in Sindh Province and from April in Punjab Province and the other provinces. This \nprocurement price is significantly higher than the 2008 price (PRs625 per 40 kg), and it has had \na  positive  impact  on  production.  Current  2009  wheat  forecasts  are  for  25  million  tons.  The \nGovernment indicated that the procurement price was based on cost of production and reflected \nregional and international wheat prices at that time of approximately $360 per ton (US hard red \nwheat grade 2). It did not reflect forecast international wheat price movements. \n \nSince  setting  the  procurement  price,  international  wheat  prices  have  fallen  (to \n13. \napproximately  $250  per  ton,  at  present),  and  the  procurement  price  is currently  approximately \n$70\u2013$100 per ton above the world price and above the export parity price but below the import \nparity price. This price differential, with a procurement price above the international wheat price, \nhas  increased  pressure  on  the  Government  to  undertake  higher  levels  of  procurement,  and  it \nhas  imposed  financial  and  logistics  burdens  on  the  procurement  agencies.  In  February  2009, \nthe Government announced a wheat import ban. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n51 \n\nUPDATED ENERGY SECTOR BRIEFING NOTE \n\nTechnical \n\n \n1. \nThe acute power shortage in Pakistan is a threat to the social and economic fabric of the \nnation.   Since FY2007, Pakistan has been suffering from an energy crisis caused by a severe \nsupply deficit (reaching up to 5,000 MW peak shortfall in FY 2009). In some places, especially in \nrural areas, there are 10\u201312 hours of load shedding.  Thirty four percent (34%) of the population \nhas no access to electricity from the national grid.  Disruptions in electricity and gas supply are \nfurther  slowing  down  economic  growth  and  global  competitiveness.  Growth  in  2008  was \nconstrained to 5.8%.1  With the shortage of supply it is difficult to increase access to reliable and \naffordable electricity needed.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nAccording to the Government's Medium-Term Development Framework (2005\u20132015), if \nthe economy were to grow at 8% per annum, around 2,000 MW of generating capacity would \nneed to be added each year.  New capacity has not been added in line with demand.  There is \n19,420  MW  of  installed  power  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan.  However,  accounting  for  the \nseasonal nature of hydroelectric plants, gas shortage and closure of some plants, the available \ncapacity  is  around  14,000  MW.  Uncapped  demand  is  estimated  at  21,000  MW.  Larger \ncommercial  customers  are  relying  on  captive  generation,  which  has  raised  their  cost  of \nbusiness,  while  smaller commercial  customers  are  facing  a  decline  in  their  productivity  due  to \nthe  unreliability  of  electricity  supply.  In  FY2009/10,  2,114  MW  of  new  installed  capacity  is \nexpected  from  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  1,247  MW  from  rental  power \ncontracted for 3\u20135 years. Even with this addition, some shortage is expected and load-shedding \nwould be necessary. \n \n3. \nThe  energy  system  also  suffers  from  high  transformation  losses.  System-wide \ntransmission losses remain high at 23.4% of dispatched power, despite some improvements in \nrecent years.  Investment in the sector has been inadequate, and ageing plant and equipment \nare hampered by inadequate maintenance in the past.  The Government has developed clear \nroadmaps and investment plans for the power transmission and distribution sectors, which are \nnow  being  implemented  with  financing  assistance  from  development  institutions.  Each \ndistribution  company  (DISCO)  has  been  given  an  incentive  to  reduce  their  technical  losses \nthrough their tariff.   \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAlthough  good  progress  has  been  made  in  strengthening  the  financial  and  corporate \nindependence  of  the  power  sector  companies  after  unbundling  in  1998,  problems  continue  to \nexist.    Examples  of  this  include:  the  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch  Company  (NTDC) \nacting  as  a  borrowing  vehicle,  which  is  beyond  its  transmission  company  mandate;  the  cross \nservicing of, and pledging of receivables and other assets to secure debt owed by other entities; \nand central control of cash flows.    \n \nThe lack of independence impacts the ability of these public power sector companies to \n5. \neffectively perform their mandate (distribute, transmit or generate electricity), maximize the long-\nterm  return  on  assets  and  attract  new  investment  into  the  sector  through  the  provision  of \ncreditworthy power purchase and other agreements.   Under the current arrangement, there is \nno incentive to improve performance. \n\nGovernance  \n\n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009 (Pakistan, pp. 210-216). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nFinancial Issues \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nFrom 2003\u20132007, customer tariffs were not raised despite the threefold increase in cost.  \nDespite  the  20%  increase  in  2008/09,  the  extraordinary  spike  in  oil  prices  accelerated  the \npayment  arrears  to  the  power  generating  companies,  and  plants  were  not  able  to  operate  at \noptimal capacity due to lack of funds to pay for fuel.  These conditions made the environment \ndifficult  for  increased  private  investment  in  power  generation  through  IPPS  or  rentals.    The \nsituation has improved since the decrease in oil prices and recent steps taken by Government, \nwhich include the adoption of the Power Sector Circular Debt Resolution Plan.   \n \n7. \nThe  National  Electricity  Power  Regulatory  Board  (NEPRA)  determines  generation, \ntransmission,  distribution  and  retail/wholesale  tariffs.    The  price  is  determined  at  full  cost \nrecovery  and  agreed  profitability.  Based  on  the  determination,  the  Government  notifies  the \nofficial tariff.  For the retail/wholesale tariff, any difference between the determined and notified \ntariff should be paid by the Government through the tariff differential subsidy. Tariff differential \nsubsidies were to be paid to the DISCOs to make up for the shortfall in the customer tariff and \ncost recovery tariff.  It is estimated that PRs 308 billion of subsidy is owed by the Government. \nWith  this  and  non-payment  by  public  and  private  customers  (PRs226  billion),  the  DISCOs  \naccumulated  PRs407  billion  ($5.08  billion)  of  payables  for  their  electricity  purchase  from  the \nNTDC, being the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), as of 31 March 2009.   \n \n8. \nWith  Government  guarantee,  in  March/April  2009,  NTDC/CPPA  had  to  borrow  PRs92 \nbillion from banks to pay the fuel costs of IPPs and government-owned generating companies \n(GENCOs).  Total  liabilities  of  NTDC/CPPA  owed  to  these  firms,  amount  to  PRs250  billion \n($3.12 billion) as of 31 March 2009.   \n \n9. \nFurther,  a  total  amount  of  PRs216  billion  of  bank  debt  has  been  accumulated  by \nWAPDA, DISCOs and NTDC to remedy the cash shortfall.  To service this debt, tariffs need to \nbe significantly increased or the Government needs to take over the debt.  IPPs and GENCOs \nalso need to be paid PRs142 billion in cash immediately for them to be able to provide power at \noptimal capacity. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nFor  a  reliable,  sustainable  power  sector,  there  is  a  need  for  (i)  cost  recovery  tariff, \n(ii) resolution of the accumulated debt, (iii) financial and corporate independence of public power \nsector companies, (iv) establishment of CPPA as an independent entity, and (v) cash injection \ninto  the  IPPs  and  GENCOs  to  cover  fuel,  operating,  and  maintenance  costs  that  are \nimmediately payable.  On the technical side, (i) an updated integrated energy plan, (ii) reduction \nof  losses  and  increase  collection  in  line  with  the  distribution  road  map,  and  (iii)  continued \naugmentation  and  improvement  of  transmission  lines  based  on  the  transmission  road  map, \nwould need to be implemented.  The adoption and implementation of the Power Sector Circular \nDebt Resolution Plan by the Government should address many of these issues.   \n\nAnalysis \n\n \n\n\fPOWER SECTOR CIRCULAR DEBT RESOLUTION PLAN \n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n55 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n57 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n59 \n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR BRIEFING NOTE \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nStructural  transformation  depends  upon  an  effective  and  efficient  financial  sector  to \n1. \nmobilize savings, help identify good business opportunities, and monitor business performance. \nThe Government is committed to reforming this sector to enable it to become a more inclusive \npart of the Pakistan economy.  \n \n2. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the  Government  to  develop  the \nfinancial  sector  for  the  last  14  years.  ADB\u2019s  initial  focus  was  on  capital  market  development, 1 \nwhich  was  later  expanded  to  support  development  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector  and  to \nimprove access of the poor to the financial sector.2 In 2008, the Government requested ADB to \nprovide assistance for banking sector reforms.3 Strengthening financial governance has become \nmore urgent as a result of the global financial turmoil, which has led to liquidity constraints in the \nbanking system and increased prudential risks. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nWhile  efforts  have  been  made  to  expand  the  role  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector  in \nPakistan, privately owned banks continue to dominate; overall, banking sector assets comprise \napproximately  72%  of  total  financial  sector  assets.  As  reflected  in  Table  A10.3,  banks  have \nbeen increasing their market share in recent years. However, the rapid credit growth during the \nlast  few  years  has  increased  the  credit  risk  for  this  sector.  Nonperforming  loans  increased  to \nabout  9.1%  of  loans  outstanding  in  2008  compared  to  7.2%  in  2007.    Banks\u2019  profitability \ndeclined  by    about  27.1%  from  the  previous  year,  reflecting  in  part  growing  provisioning \nrequirements in response to the rise in nonperforming loans. \n \nThe sector has also become more diversified. To promote greater economies of scale, \n4. \nthere have been 22 bank mergers and 7 bank acquisitions since 2000, most of which involved \nmergers between commercial and investment banks. Groups of affiliated financial sector entities \n(financial conglomerates) are becoming the norm, as banks broaden their product offerings and \nseek  cross-selling  opportunities.  A  number  of  banks  also  own  shares  in  insurance  companies \nand have interests in asset management companies and mutual funds. Some banks engage in \n\nBank-Dominated Financial Sector \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1995.

In  terms  of \nasset  size,  mutual  funds  constitute  68%  of  the  NBFC  subsector.  The  number  of  mutual  funds \nincreased from 67 in 2007 to 87 (as of 30 June 2008). While NBFCs have been growing, due to \nthe expansion of mutual funds, their share of total financial sector assets continues to decline. \nThe insurance sector has had limited growth. The housing finance sector remains stagnant and \nventure  capital  development  is  at  an  early  stage.  Universal  banking  also  places  pressure  on \nNBFCs.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  capital  market  in  Pakistan  includes  three  stock  exchanges,  located  in  Karachi, \nLahore,  and  Islamabad.  The  exchanges  trade  ordinary  shares;  mutual  fund  certificates; \nmodaraba  certificates;  government  and  corporate  bonds,  including  sukuk 5 and  term  finance \ncertificates  (TFCs).  In  the  capital  market,  new  issues  of  shares  are  very  limited  and  private \ncorporate  listed  issues  of  TFCs  and  sukuk  are  of  limited  importance.  Growing  financing \nrequirements  of  private  and  public  infrastructure  investments,  particularly  in  the  transportation \nand  energy  sectors,  are  likely  to  remain  unmet  unless  new  long-term  financing  sources  are \ndeveloped  outside  the  banking  system.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nFramework  (2005\u20132010)  conservatively  estimates  that  some  $150  billion  (PRs120  trillion)  will \nbe required for such investments over this period.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nPakistan  has  adopted  an  institutional  approach  to  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  under  which  a  firm\u2019s  legal  status  determines  which  regulator  is  tasked  with \noverseeing its activity from a safety, soundness, and business conduct perspective. Under this \napproach,  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)  supervises  and  regulates  banks,  development \nfinance  institutions,  microfinance  banks,  and  exchange  companies.  The  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) regulates the nonbank financial sector. Regulatory \napproaches  differ\u2014the  SBP  focuses  on  prudential  regulation  and  mitigation  of  systemic  risks, \nand the SECP concentrates on investor protection through conduct of business and disclosure \nrequirements.   \n \nUnder  the  Banking  Companies  Ordinance  (1962),  banks  are  deposit-taking  institutions \n8. \nand can perform all of the functions performed by NBFCs, either directly or through a subsidiary. \nWhen  performed  through  a  subsidiary,  SECP  has  jurisdiction  over  the  subsidiary.  Due  to  the \nnascent state of the capital market, a number of NBFCs are engaged in deposit taking, which is \ntraditionally regulated by banking regulators to address prudential risks concerns. These NBFCs \nmobilize  short-term  funds  from  the  general  public  and  extend  working  capital  and  overdraft \nfacilities  to  businesses.  Since  they  are  prohibited  from  undertaking  commercial  banking \n\nFinancial Sector Supervision  \n\n                                                 \n4  Modaraba  is  a  contract  in  which  one  party  provides  capital  to  another  party  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  on  a \nbusiness  with  the  stipulation  that  the  profit  will  be  shared  by  participating  parties  in  clearly  defined  proportions \nagreed beforehand. Any loss incurred is borne by the capital owner.  \n\n5   A sukuk is a security resembling a bond but that complies with Islamic law. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n61 \n\nGovernment Reform Agenda \n\nactivities, they get around this restriction by issuing withdrawal slips that work like checkbooks. \nA  recent  scandal  involving  one  of  the  largest  investment  banks  in  Pakistan  led  the  SECP  to \nissue a directive to this bank to cease taking deposits.  \n \nNBFCs were previously supervised by the SBP, notwithstanding the absence of enabling \n9. \nlegislation providing SBP with sufficient supervisory powers. Since all NBFCs were incorporated \nas  companies  under  the  Companies  Ordinance  (1984),  only  the  SECP  appeared  to  have  the \npower  to  take  action  against  these  firms.  Thus,  when  off-site  surveillance  and  on-site \ninspections of NBFCs by SBP highlighted irregularities, SBP had to request SECP to take action \nagainst  them.  In  December  2002,  the  Companies  Ordinance  was  amended  to  clarify  SECP\u2019s \njurisdiction  over  NBFCs.  That  jurisdiction  was  thus  transferred  from  SBP.  The  amendments \nallowed  NBFCs  to  offer  a  range  of  financial  products  in  order  to  encourage  single-product \nNBFCs  serving  a  specific  market  niche  to  merge.  There  was  limited  consolidation  of  NBFC \nactivities,  however,  even  as  banks  started  making  rapid  inroads  into  this  area.  At  the  time  of \ntheir transfer from SBP to SECP, there were 16 investment banks, compared with 8 at present.  \n \nF. \n \n10. \nIn  the  mid-  to  late-1990s,  the  Government  undertook  major  financial  sector  reforms. \nBased on the institutional approach to regulation, reforms focused on institutional versus sector-\nwide issues.  \n \n11. \nBanking  sector.  Prior  to  the  Government\u2019s  reform  program,  state-owned  banks \ncomprised  80%  of  the  banking  sector  and  were  characterized  by  poor  performance  and  high \nnonperforming loans (often in excess of 70%). Financing for small and medium enterprises and \nmicrofinance  was  nonexistent.  Under  the  reform  agenda,  banking  sector  performance  was \nfacilitated  by  privatization;  restructuring  of  major  banks;  consolidation;  strengthening  of  the \nregulatory and supervisory framework and related capacity; and improvements in transparency, \ncorporate  governance,  and  the  credit  culture.  Reforms  included  adopting  international  best \npractice standards for risk management and money laundering (see discussion below).  \n \n12. \nAs  a  result  of  the  successful  reform  agenda,  the  private  sector  now  accounts  for \napproximately 81% of the banking sector. Access to financial services has increased. Banking \nsector  assets  rose  by  50%  over  the  last  3  years  and  the  industry\u2019s  assets  now  exceed  PRs5 \ntrillion. There has been a major improvement in the sector\u2019s profitability and financial strength. \nReturn on banking assets after taxes rose from 0.1% in 2002 to 1.2% in 2008. Return on equity \nincreased from 3.2% in 2002 to 11.3% in 2008. The SBP introduced Basel II and banks have \nhigher capital adequacy levels that are well above the minimum level for the sector as a whole. \nDespite  economic  shock  and  stress  in  the  stock  market,  the  banking  system  has  shown \nincreased profitability in the first quarter of 2009.  \n \n13. \nSBP  is  implementing  payment  and  settlement  system  reforms.  In  July  2008,  the  SBP \nlaunched the Pakistan Real Time Interbank Settlement Mechanism (PRISM), which is the real \ntime  gross  settlement  system  for  wholesale  payment  transactions.  The  system  is  designed  to \nhandle  all  large-value  payments.  Preliminary  work  has  also  started  on  modernizing  the  retail \npayment  and  settlement  system  to  encourage  electronic  and  mobile  telephone-based \ntransactions. SBP is working with a wide range of stakeholders to promote the use of efficient \nelectronic payment instruments that includes a high level of standardization, schemes that allow \nfor  new  retail  payment \nstraight-through  processing  and  development  of \ninstruments, and alternative channels for making payments.  \n \n\ninfrastructure \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nTo guide its reform agenda over the longer term, the SBP adopted and launched a 10-\n14. \nyear strategy to broaden and deepen the banking sector. The objectives of the strategy are to \nmake  the  banking  sector  (i)  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  economy  and  thus  help \nachieve a more rapid and sustainable economic growth; (ii) financially stronger, more resilient, \nand stable; (iii) better regulated and supervised; and (iv) more efficient and stable. \n  \n15. \nNonbank  Financial  Sector.  Pakistan  has  made  progress  with  capital  market  reforms \nsince  1998,  when  a  year-long  economic  crisis  had  resulted  in  a  stock  market  crash.  A  new \nregulator, the SECP was established to help develop the capital markets.6  \n \n16.  With support from ADB, SECP has undertaken a number of regulatory, supervisory, and \nmarket-reform  initiatives,  including  risk  management  measures  and  introduction  of  new \nproducts. Equity capitalization has improved, and Pakistan\u2019s stock market has been one of the \nbest performing markets since the start of 2008. Nevertheless, and although the stock market \ncapitalization  has  shown  spectacular  increases  in  recent  years, 7 the  market  does  not  play  a \nmajor intermediary role. There have been few new listings and stock values declined sharply in \n2008.  The  private  debt  securities  market  remains  rudimentary  in  scope.  The  government  debt \nmarket has grown in recent years to meet the Government\u2019s growing financing needs, but the \nframework for issuing, pricing, and trading government securities remains underdeveloped. The \ngrowth of NBFCs continues to lag that of banks. \n \n17. \nPreventing  Money  Laundering.  The  Government  is  strongly  committed  to  safeguard \nthe  financial  sector  from  being  used  to  launder  the  proceeds  from  criminal  activities.  In \nfurtherance  thereof,  Pakistan  has  become  a  member  of  the  Asia  Pacific  Group  on  Money \nLaundering,  a  regional  body  associated  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  on  Money \nLaundering  (FATF).  FATF  sets  international  standards  for  global  efforts  in  anti-money \nlaundering  and  countering  the  financing  of  terrorism.  The  FATF  40+9  recommendations  set \nforth international standards. In September 2007, Pakistan adopted an Anti-Money Laundering \n(AML) Ordinance that establishes its framework for AML activities and establishes the Financial \nMonitoring Unit (FMU) in the SBP to receive and process reports on suspicious activities.  \n \n18. \nOngoing Issues in Financial Sector Development. Notwithstanding reform initiatives, \nfinancial  sector  indicators  in  Pakistan  continue  to  lag  behind  those  of  other  countries.  Key \nissues in the financial sector8 include the following: \n\n(i) \n\nInvestor  and  depositor  protection.  The  legislation  establishing  the  SBP  and \nthe  SECP,  respectively,  do  not  provide  for  the  level  of  independence  and \naccountability  arrangements  needed  to  enable  these  institutions  to  effectively \n\n                                                 \n6  The capital market includes three stock exchanges, a national clearing and settlement system, a central depository, \nand  449  NBFCs  (as  of  2007).  NBFCs  include  leasing  companies,  investment  banks,  discount  houses,  housing \nfinance  companies,  and  mutual  funds.  The  state-owned  Central  Directorate  of  National  Savings  is  the  largest \ninstitutional investor in Pakistan, followed by the State Life Insurance Company and Employees' Old Age Benefits \nInstitution.  \n\n7  The global financial crisis, macroeconomic conditions, political uncertainty, and implementation of a pricing floor at \nthe  Karachi  Stock  Exchange  (KSE)  in  2008  have  badly  hurt  the  stock  market.  Subsequent  government \ninterventions  have  helped  stabilize  the  market.  Based  on  deteriorating  macroeconomic  conditions  and  security \nconcerns,  and  a  related  decline  in  the  share  trading  prices  on  the  KSE,  KSE  management  imposed  a  floor  on \nexchange traded prices in August 2008. While the floor halted a further drop in share trading prices, once it  was \nlifted  the  benchmark  KSE  100  index  continued  to  decline.  During  2008,  Pakistani  stock  lost  55%  of  its  value.  In \nJanuary 2009, to stabilize the market, the government-owned National Investment Trust (NIT), the country's largest \nasset management company, helped establish the NIT State Enterprise Fund to invest PRs20 billion into the stock \nmarket.  \n\n8  Included here are issues reflected in the AETP that ADB is helping the Government to address.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n63 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nfulfill  their  assigned  functions,  address  the  blurring  of  product  lines  and  the \nemergence  of  financial  conglomerates,  or  provide  an  effective  enforcement \nframework  to  deter  and  address  violations.  The  recent  global  financial  market \nturmoil and the privately owned structure of the banking system also highlight the \nurgent need for a financial safety net to deal with contagion and systemic risks. \nThis  includes  depositor  protection,  liquidity,  and  lender  of  last  resort  facilities  in \nthe  SBP;  an  exit  framework  to  deal  effectively  with  bank  failures  in  a  way  that \nstrengthens  the  banking  system;  and  improved  coordination  mechanisms  within \nthe Government in cases of systemic problems.   \nRegulatory  arbitrage. NBFCs that take deposits are subject to lower prudential \nregulations  imposed  by  the  SECP,  thus  raising  concerns  about  regulatory \narbitrage. Lending limits by banks that are part of a financial conglomerate may \nbe  circumvented  by  directing  loans  to  NBFCs  that  take  deposits.  There  is  also \npublic  confusion  about  the  role  of  the  SBP  in  supervising  NBFCs,  since  many \ninvestment banks use the word \u201cbank\u201d in their names.  \nPayment  system.  Although  Pakistan  has  made  progress  in  developing \nelectronic  payments,  the  existing  retail  payment  system  is  largely  based  on \nchecks  and  cash.  SBP  has  requested  ADB  support  in  this  area  to  accelerate \nefforts  to  take  advantage  of  new  technologies  and  prevent  a  proliferation  of \nincompatible systems by developing and implementing an overall strategy in this \narea.  \nFMU  autonomy.  The  AML  Ordinance  provides  for  a  cumbersome  FMU \nsupervisory structure consisting of a national executive committee and a general \ncommittee.  The  national  executive  committee  includes  relevant  ministers,  the \nSBP  Governor,  the  SECP  chairman,  and  the  director  general  of  the  FMU.  The \ngeneral  committee \nthe  ministries \nincludes  principal  civil  servants \nrepresented  at  the  national  executive  committee,  the  SBP  governor,  SECP \nchairman,  and  the  director  general  of  the  FMU.  While  the  general  committee  is \nintended  to  provide  assistance  to  the  national  level  committee  in  implementing \nthe law, it is unclear how this structure is supposed to work in practice. The two-\nprong  structure  appears  bureaucratic  and  may  be  cumbersome  to  implement. \nThe  law  also  envisages  that  the  director  general  of  the  FMU  will  be  supervised \nand controlled by the general committee, which is inconsistent with international \nstandards. The FMU also needs to be financially and operationally autonomous.   \n\nfrom \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n2001 \n\n3,042.7 \n\nTable A10.1: Asset Composition of the Financial Sector \n \n2005 \n5,201.5 \n15.1 \n \n0.2 \n7.6 \n3.9 \n18.0 \n70.4 \n \n0.1 \n5.6 \n2.9 \n13.3 \n51.8 \n73.7 \n\n2008 \nItem \n7,646.6 \nAssets (PRs billion) \n7.5 \nGrowth rate (%) \n \n% of total assets \n0.2 \n    MFIs \n8.0 \n    NBFIs \n5.5 \n    Insurance \n14.2 \n    CDNS \n72.1 \n    Banks \n \n% of GDP \n0.1 \n    MFIs \n5.9 \n    NBFIs \n4.0 \n    Insurance \n10.3 \n    CDNS \n52.6 \n    Banks \n    Overall \n73.0 \nCDNS = central directorate of national savings, GDP = gross domestic product, MFIs = microfinance institutions; \nNBFIs = nonbank financial institutions. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. 2008.

The  scope  is  in  line  with  Pakistan\u2019s  second  poverty  reduction  strategy \n(PRSP II) and ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  PRSP  II  covers  a  3-year  period  from  FY2009  to  FY2011.  Its  overall  vision  is  to  regain \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  attain  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  7%  by  FY2013;  create  adequate \nemployment  opportunities;  improve  income  distribution;  and  enhance  global  competitiveness  through  economic \nliberalization, deregulation, and transparent privatization. PRSP II is built upon nine pillars: (i) macroeconomic stability \nand  real  sector  growth,  (ii)  protecting  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable,  (iii)  increasing  productivity  and  value  addition  in \nagriculture, (iv) an integrated energy development program, (v) making industry internationally competitive, (vi) human \ndevelopment  for  the  21st  century,  (vii) removing  bottlenecks  through  public-private  partnerships,  (viii)  capital  and \nfinance  for  development,  and  (ix) governance  for  a  just  and  fair  system.  To  support  the  second  pillar,  protecting  the \npoor and the vulnerable, the Government has taken steps to improve the social safety system and is implementing a \nmajor new cash transfer system for the poorest, the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). The Program supports \nthe expansion and improvement of targeted social safety net interventions to the poor and vulnerable under BISP. \n \nADB  is  a  leading  partner  in  addressing  governance  and  institutional  bottlenecks,  as  well  as  binding  constraints  to \ntransformation and growth. During the country partnership strategy period, ADB will focus on structural transformation, \nincluding reforms in energy and financial markets. Policy distortions and institutional impediments continue to constrain \nthe structural transformation of the economy. These limit growth and investment. In the agriculture sector, for example, \npublic  interventions  distort  the  wheat  market  and  create  disincentives  for  farmers  to  raise  production.  This  has  been \ndetrimental to food security and has resulted in a need to import wheat at a time of high prices, adversely affecting the \nbalance of payments position. In the power sector, inefficient and unfunded subsidies and the accumulated problem of \ncircular  debt  seriously  undermine  investment,  leading  to  major  power  shortages  that  have  become  a  constraint  on \nindustrial  production.  In  the  financial  sector,  weak  governance  impedes  the  development  of  long-term  financial \ninstruments.  This  restricts  growth  in  domestic  savings.  Consequently,  savings  have  been  insufficient  to  finance \ndomestic investment and the savings\u2013investment gap has increased. The Program supports interventions that enable \nthe reduction or abolishment of federal subsidies for wheat and energy, given the development of targeted safety nets. \nPoverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention, TI-H \nB. \n1.  Key Issues  \nBetween FY2003 and FY2008, Pakistan experienced a period of macroeconomic stability and strong economic growth, \nwhich accelerated from 4.4% in FY2003 to an average 8.1% during FY2004 and FY2005, reached an all-time high of \n9% in FY2006, then maintained high growth at 6.5% and 7% in FY2007 and FY2008, respectively. Efforts were made \nduring  this  period  to  redirect  a  larger  share  of  total  public  spending  to  social  services  and  to  poor  and  vulnerable \ngroups.  Poverty-related  expenditures  grew  from  3%  of  GDP  in  FY2003  to  5.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2008.  In  addition,  the \ninflow of foreign remittances rose substantially. Between 2002 and 2008, an inflow of more than $31 billion, or 18.7% of \nGDP,  was  attributable  to  remittances.  All  these  factors  combined  (robust  growth,  macroeconomic  stability,  rising \npoverty expenditures, and high remittances from overseas Pakistanis) contributed to a decline in poverty\u2019s incidence in \nPakistan.  Poverty  estimates  based  on  the  FY2006  Pakistan  Socioeconomic  Living  Standard  Measurement  Survey \nindicated a decline of people living below the poverty line1 from 34.5% in FY2001 to 22.3% in FY2006.  \n \nThe lack of new poverty data after FY2006 does not permit an assessment of the present poverty situation, but it is to \nbe expected that poverty started increasing again in FY2009 with the high domestic inflation caused by high food and \nenergy  prices.  Household  expenditure  surveys  indicate  the  average  share  of  food  in  total  expenditures  is  inversely \n\n                                                 \n1  The poverty line is based on a threshold of 2,350 calories per adult equivalent per day, using the calorific approach \n\nfor estimation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n69 \n\n \nrelated to income levels. A sharp rise in food prices can have a devastating effect on the poor. In Pakistan, food prices \nwent up by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2008. ADB\u2019s analysis2 shows that a 10% increase in food prices can \nthrow an additional 7 million into poverty in Pakistan, a 20% increase 14.7 million, and a 30% increase an additional 22 \nmillion.  While  energy  prices  also  went  up  by  about  30%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  the  rise  in  poverty  incidence  is \nestimated  to  be  much  smaller  at  about  1.5  percentage  points.  ADB\u2019s  analysis  also  shows  that  if  every  poor  person \nwere to be compensated to offset the loss in real expenditure, the Government could incur a cost of between PRs18.5 \nbillion (0.3% of GDP) and PRs83 billion (1.3% of GDP). \n2. Design Features \nThis Program will directly benefit the poor. The impact will be through two principal mechanisms: (i) safety net support \nfor poor households; and (ii) targeting electricity subsidies. The Program will support the transition from untargeted to \ntargeted  support  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  expansion  of  the  social  safety  net  program,  making  it  more \nefficient  to  protect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  the  adverse  impact  of  recent  global  developments.  Specifically,  5 \nmillion poor families (up to 6 persons  per family on average)  will benefit from the BISP under AETP2. As part of the \ncluster, the BISP will cover 7 million poor families by June 2010. Hence, potentially the Program will help direct benefits \nto up to 42 million poor people in Pakistan. Further, the Program will help generate a significant amount of fiscal space \nby targeting electricity and wheat subsidies. \nA.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) to the country and major groups affected. \n\nFirst, it will help the Government to meet large and immediate fiscal needs.  \n\n \nThe Program will provide significant benefits in general, and directed benefits for the poor in particular.  \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Second, the Program will assist the Government to transition from inefficient and untargeted subsidies to targeted \nsafety net programs for the poor. In FY2009, budget provisions were made to target 5 million households under \nfederal  government  cash  transfer  programs  (of  which,  resources  were  provided  for  up  to    3.5  million  families \nunder BISP). In FY2010, the budget allocation will be increased to support up to 5 million families under BISP as \na  policy  condition  under  AETP2.  Subsequently,  for  the  next  phase,  the  Government  will  target  up  to  7  million \nfamilies. \nThird,  the  Program  will  raise  public  confidence  through  stronger  financial  intermediaries  that  are  better  able  to \nmobilize and allocate resources and risks.  \nFourth, the Program will open the way for structural transformation. \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Overall, the  Program  will enable ADB to sustain policy  dialogue  on structural reform in  sectors  where  ADB has \n\n\u2022 \n\nbeen actively involved through past and current investments.  \n\n \n\nanalysis). \n\n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social \n\n \nThe Government is expanding the coverage of its social safety net programs from a targeted 5 million households in \nFY2009 to 5 million families under BISP in FY2010. The Government has agreed to use the local currency generated \nfrom  the  proceeds  of  the  ADF  loan  to  support  poor  and  vulnerable  families  under  the  new  BISP.  One  of  BISP\u2019s \nqualification criteria is that the household income should be below PRs6,000. The monthly benefit is equal to PRs1,000 \nper month, a substantial increase of the monthly income. This would allow a household to finance 20\u201325 days of flour \nneeds for a 5\u20136 member family. The payout  will not alleviate poverty, but it  will protect the nutrition intake to a large \nextent  during  the  series  of  shocks  from  sharp  increases  in  food  and  fuel  prices  last  year  and  the  ongoing  global \nfinancial crisis.  \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  move  toward  market-based  wheat  pricing  and  an  efficient  reserve  management \nsystem. The transition will be gradual, reflecting the need to maintain price stability for producers and consumers until \nbetter  targeted  and  more  efficient  safety  net  programs  become  fully  operational.  An  efficiently  functioning  safety  net \nprogram will eliminate the need for continuing the existing untargeted wheat subsidy. The current untargeted subsidy is \nlargely  going  to  flour  millers.  Discontinuation  of  the  wheat  subsidy  would  cause  millers  to  pay  the  market  price.  This \nwould involve significant structural change in the flour milling industry and a likely expansion in private sector storage \ncapacity.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  reserves  could  provide  supply  security  to  minimize  risk  of  collusion  in  price \ndetermination at the local level.   \n \nSpecific  policies  are  needed  to  deal  with  the  root  causes  and  consequences  of  high  energy  prices.  For  FY2009,  the \nGovernment budgeted a PRs65 billion subsidy for tariff differential and decided to completely eliminate this subsidy by \nnext fiscal year. It is estimated that an additional 5% increase in power tariff is required to eliminate the subsidy. This \nincrease is expected to scarcely affect the poverty incidence (see key issues). \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n2  ADB.

Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium \n\nThe challenge to alleviate poverty remains huge. Pakistan, being a signatory to the Millennium Development Goals, is \ncommitted to achieving the target for poverty by halving the poverty incidence between 1990 and 2015. The estimated \n1990 level of poverty in Pakistan was 26%. Thus, this needs to move to 13% by 2015 if the target is to be met. With the \nlatest poverty estimates (FY2006) at 22.3%, there is clearly still a long way to go. The poverty problem, therefore, is not \nabout  to  be  immediately  eliminated  and  will  require  sustained  efforts.  Key  to  ensuring  long-term  success  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  programs  will  be  continued  and  consistent  pursuit  of  pro-poor  growth \npolicies, along with accompanying investments and a focus on the effectiveness of investment spending, plus forging \nlong-term and constructive partnerships with the private sector, civil society, and development institutions.    \n \nThe combined impact of the jump in food and fuel prices and the global financial crisis could pose a substantial setback \nin  the  fight  against  poverty  and  further  jeopardize  the  already  slow  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Prompt and well-targeted policy responses can substantially reduce the depth, length, and long-\nterm impact of these sudden economic shocks. The expansion of targeted safety net interventions could provide short-\nrun assistance against income shocks and protect the nutrition intake. Good safety nets require workable systems for \nenrolling  beneficiaries,  making  payments,  and  monitoring.  The  most  effective  interventions  will  be  those  that  target \npeople  who are the most vulnerable to income declines and most exposed to the crisis. The Government decided to \nrefine its targeting method using poverty score cards. Under the BISP program, the score card method was piloted in \n10 districts in FY2009, and it will be rolled out in the coming fiscal year to all districts. The other safety net programs \nwould eventually use the same targeting method. With the introduction of BISP, the Government opted for direct cash \ntransfers  which have low administrative costs and do not distort prices. The fiscal implications of public interventions \nmay  seem  daunting,  particularly  given  the  public  spending  stresses  already  experienced  by  Pakistan.  But  the  fiscal \ncosts of  well-targeted  interventions for the poorest need not be  unduly  high, especially  compared to the present and \nfuture costs of not having them in place. For a large share of developing countries, spending on overall safety nets has \nbeen  on  the  order  of  1\u20132%  of  GDP  in  recent  years.  Critically,  the  future  costs  associated  with  not  taking  action  are \nlikely to be many times higher than the savings from inaction.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe  poor  and  the  vulnerable  are  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  targeted  interventions  through  social  safety  net \nprograms. Based on the FY2006 poverty assessment, 22.3% of the population, or roughly 35 million people, are living \nunder the poverty line. Estimates of the incidence of vulnerability range between 47% and 67%. The vulnerable include \nboth  the  chronically  poor  and  the  transitorily  poor  (those  around  or  just  below  the  poverty  line).  The  vulnerable  in \nPakistan  typically  include  the  landless  and  the  homeless;  widows,  and  especially  those  with  dependents  and  no \nsupport;  women  and  children  from  poor  households;  low-caste  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups  and  minorities;  those \nwithout  access  to  health  and  education  and  dependent  on  charitable  donations  for  subsistence;  and  the  politically \ndisenfranchised. About one third of the entire population is vulnerable due to low levels of resources, while for 24% to \n34% of the population vulnerability to poverty stems from high volatility of consumption. Vulnerability is concentrated in \nrural areas and is mainly caused by low levels of consumption.  \n \nWheat  is  the  main  staple  in  Pakistan.  Given  the  large  population  of  poor  and  low-income  earners  (small-scale \nproducers  and  consumers),  wheat  price  stabilization  has  been  a  long-term  government  policy  objective.  Half  of \nPakistan\u2019s  population  is  considered  to  be  \"food  insecure.\u201d  Food  security  is  measured  in  terms  of  physical  access  to \nfood (or its availability), economic access to food, and biological utilization of food (food absorption). Many studies note \nthat  in  Pakistan  physical  availability  of  food  (including  wheat  flour)  may  not  be  the  main  issue,  but  rather  that \nconsumers  are  constrained  by  poverty,  as  their  low  incomes  impede  their  ability  to  use  food  adequately  to  obtain \nbalanced and proper nutrition.  \n \nThe Program will assist the Government in ensuring food availability and access to wheat flour, and especially for the \npoor and vulnerable groups. The key agenda for action includes to (i) develop social safety net programs targeting the \npoor and vulnerable with cash transfers, and (ii) move toward market-based wheat pricing.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nExtensive consultations were conducted with the Government, including the Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Industries; \nMinistry  of  Commerce;  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock;  Ministry  of  Labor,  Manpower,  and  Overseas \nPakistanis; State Bank of Pakistan; Planning Commission; Board of Investment; Privatization Commission; Engineering \nDevelopment  Board,  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Secretariat  responsible  for  the  Benazir  Income  Support  Program;  with \nthe  private  sector  (including  ABN/AMRO,  KPMG,  McKinsey);  and  with  other  development  partners  (including  the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank). \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nA  list  of  key  agencies  and  individuals  to  be  consulted  was  drawn  up  prior  to  loan  processing  missions.  Strong \ncoordination and decision-making abilities are vital for the Program. The Secretary of Finance is steering the Program. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.      Key  Issues.  Gender  inequality  continues  to  be  an  area  of  concern  in  Pakistan.  Limited  access  to  income-\ngenerating  opportunities,  together  with  a  range  of  life  cycle  risks  related  to  malnutrition,  school  non-attendance, \nmarriage  and  dowry,  pregnancy  and  child  birth,  and  widowhood  has  left  women  considerably  more  vulnerable  to \npoverty than men. This results in increasing feminization of poverty.         \n\n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n \n\nBISP, the Government\u2019s flagship safety net program, has a unique feature in which the payment will be made only to \nthe  female  head  of  a  family,  thereby  aiming  to  address  the  feminization  of  poverty.  Computerized  national  identity \ncards  (CNICs)  are  being  issued  by  the  National  Database  and  Registration  Authority  (NADRA)  to  those  women  who \nhave  none,  providing  them  with  a  legal  identity  that  represents  a  first  step  to  empowering  women.  BISP  will  provide \nADB  with  an  update  on  the  progress  In  issuing  these  cards  in  quarterly  utilization  reports.  The  ultimate  aim  of  the \nGovernment  is  to  devise  programs  that  also  support  graduation  from  the  safety  net  through  income  generation  and \nsustainable livelihoods. \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\n \nNo impact \n\n \nNo impact \n\n \nNo impact.  \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nand/or \n\n \nAffordability \nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict,  political \ninstability,  etc),  please \nspecify: Disaster relief \n\n \nNo impact \nIn  the  recent  past,  Pakistan \nhas been affected by natural \nand  manmade  disasters,  an \nearthquake \nin  Balochistan, \nrecent  troubles  in  the  Swat \nValley  and  in  the  Federal \nAdministered  Tribal  Areas \n(FATA) \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\n \n\n \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\naffected \n\nThe  mandate  of  BISP \nhas  been  expanded  to \nvulnerable \ninclude \ngroups \nby \nnatural  or  manmade \nDuring \ndisasters. \nBISP \nFY2009 \n18,000 \nregistered \ninternally \nfemale \ndisplaced  persons \nin \nthe  FATA,  who  are \nreceiving \nsame \nthe \ncash benefits.  \n\nIV.
