An \ninitial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  were  prepared.  The  Project\u2019s \noverall  environmental  effects  are  positive.  It  will  (i)  improve \nsurface  and  groundwater  quality,  including  marine  waters,  by \nreducing untreated and partially treated sewage discharges to the \nenvironment;  (ii)  improve  public  health  by  reducing  sewage  and \ndecreasing flooding; and (iii) reduce solid waste to urban streams \nand  marine  waters  by  improving  drainage  system  management. \nAn  environmental  assessment \nthe  overall  Project  was \nprepared and approved by the Planning and Urban Management \nAgency  and  is  updated  periodically  to  reflect  refinements  of \ncomponent  designs  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement plans. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  (i)  improved  drainage  and  floodways  in \nApia\u2019s  Fugalei  area;  (ii)  a  sewerage  system  including  pressure \nsewers and a wastewater treatment plant to service the low-lying \ncentral  business  area  and  special  needs  areas  including  the \nNational  Hospital,  Malifa  Education  Compound,  commercial \nproperties  located  at  Beach  Road,  and  Fugalei  Market;  (iii)  a \nseptic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  to  service \napproximately 8,000 households within the greater Apia area; and \n(iv)  strengthened \nfor  wastewater  management, \ndrainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n \nIn greater Apia, which has a population of approximately 60,000, \n75%  of  households  have  septic  tank  systems,  but  many  are  too \nsmall, rarely cleaned, and in some instances discharge directly to \nthe nearest drainage channel, thus polluting groundwater, surface \nstreams, and the harbor. In the central business area and special \nneeds  areas\u2014those  with  special  wastewater  concerns  such  as \nhospitals  and  major  school  compounds\u2014less  than  10%  of \nwastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has ineffective on-\nsite  sewage  treatment  facilities  as  do  most  commercial  centers \nand  government  complexes.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  the \nhistorical  lack  of  urban  management  and  absence  of  effective \ntown  planning,  development  controls,  and  adequate  urban \ndrainage and wastewater infrastructure. Flooding after heavy rain \n\ninstitutions \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nis intensified and foul-water flooding poses a health risk due to the \nrelease of septage and latrine wastes to the surface environment. \nInadequate sanitation and wastewater management systems have \nsignificantly  degraded  nearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream \nwater quality in Apia.  \n \nSamoa  is  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  Severe  floods  were \nreported  in  1939,  1975,  2001,  and  2003.  In  addition,  localized \nflooding  occurs  annually.  The  2001  flood  damage  was  estimated \nat  $4.4  million  in  2001  prices.  About  5,000  people  were  directly \naffected  by  the  flooding  and  about  28,000  experienced  water \nshortages.  Businesses  were  forced  to  close  as  the  water  supply \nnetwork  was  damaged.  Other  impacts  included  the  spilling  of \nseptic tanks with resulting environmental and health impacts. \n \nFollowing  a  request  by  the  Government  in  February  2003,  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Sanitation  and \nDrainage  Project  (the  Project)  for  SDR5.604  million  ($8  million \nequivalent) on 27 November 2003. Following detailed design and \nbidding for the larger project components, the Government asked \nADB to provide supplementary financing to help meet anticipated \ncost overruns of $7.8 million. The Government informed ADB that \nit  was  unable  to  reduce  the  scope  of  the  Project  without \ncompromising  the  project  goals,  and  could  not  finance  the  cost \noverrun  from  its  own  resources  due  to  fiscal  constraints.  The \nGovernment also informed ADB that it had sought the assistance \nof other international development partners to help meet the cost \noverrun through grants. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  a  high  standard  of  environmental \nquality and public health for Apia. Outcomes of the Project will be \neffective  and  sustainable  sewage  collection  and \ntreatment \nsystems, and less frequent and severe floods in Apia, through the \nprovision of adequate wastewater and drainage infrastructure, and \neffective wastewater and drainage planning and management. \n \nThe revised project cost estimate is $17.81 million, including taxes \nand duties of $2.17 million.  \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n1,710,000  ($2,780,000  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Financing and Project \nAgreements.  In  addition,  a  grant  of  $2,220,000  will  be  provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to ease the macroeconomic \nimpact of the financing requirements for cost overruns. \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nSupplementary \nFinancing Plan \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\n% \n35.6 \n28.4 \n36.0 \n100.0 \n\n($ million) \n\nFinancing Source \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nAsian Development Bank Grant \nGovernment of Samoa \nTotal Project Cost \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n2.78 \n2.22 \n2.81 \n7.81 \n\n   \n \nThe ADB loan and grant will be provided to the Independent State \nof  Samoa.

The  relending  will \nhave a 30-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an \ninterest  rate  of  5%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the subsidiary financing agreement between \nthe  Government  and  SWA.  An  amendment  to  the  existing \nSubsidiary  Loan  Agreement  will  reflect \nthe  supplementary \nfinancing  and  the  conditions  in  the  supplementary  financing  and \nproject  agreements.  The  Government  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange risk arising from the loan. \n \n1 July 2008\u201331 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010 \n\n \nThe existing implementation arrangements for the Project in terms \nof (i) project management; (ii) accounting, auditing, and reporting; \nand  (iii)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  are \nconsidered  adequate  and  will  remain  unchanged.  Project  review \nmissions will continue to be undertaken on a 6-monthly basis. \n \nMinistry of Finance \n \nThe  equipment,  material,  and  works  financed  by  the  proceeds  of \nthe  loan  and  grant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nProject  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation \nassistance  (PIA)  consultants  were  recruited  in  November  2004 \nand  May  2006,  respectively.  The  PMU  consultants\u2019  contract \nexpired  on  30  June  2008  and  the  PIA  consultants\u2019  contract \nexpires on 31 December 2008. The PMU and the PIA consultants \nhave  performed  well  and  their  services  are  needed  for  the \nduration  of  project  implementation.  The  PMU  and  the  PIA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nusing single source selection.  \n \nUrban  Apia  currently  lacks  an  efficient  drainage  system.  Severe \nfloods have caused major damage to structures and disruptions to \nthe \neconomic  activity,  directly  affecting  business,  most  of \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\npopulation in Apia, and the overall economy. In addition, localized \nflooding  occurs  annually.  This  situation  is  compounded  by a  lack \nof  an  efficient  and  centralized  system \nfor  wastewater \nmanagement.  The  Samoa  Country  Environmental  Analysis \nidentified the need to address the high solid waste generation and \ninadequate  waste  management  practices.  The  Project  will \nimprove Apia\u2019s environment and public health. \n \nThe  economic  analyses  on  the  drainage  and  floodway,  and \nwastewater  components  were  reappraised \ninclude  cost \noverruns  as  a  result  of  factors  associated  with  implementation \ndelays.  Benefits  for  the  drainage  and  floodway  component  are \nquantified  in  terms  of  avoided  costs  of  damage  resulting  from \nflooding.  The  internal  economic  rate  of  return  is  13.2%.  Benefits \nfor  the  centralized  sewerage  system  are  quantified  in  terms  of \ncost  savings  as  compared  to  the  alternative  investment  scenario \nof using individual sewerage systems. The internal economic rate \nof return is 16.5%. The results are robust with respect to changes \nin key assumptions and risks. \n \nFurther  delays  and  project  cost  increases  are  not  expected  as \nmajor  contracts  have  been  awarded  and  bid  documents  for  all \nother contracts have been completed.  \n \nThe Government has demonstrated its commitment to the Project \nand  overall  urban  management  through  the  establishment  of  the \nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Agency,  promulgation  of  the \nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Bill,  and  efforts  to  develop  the \nProject.  Draft  sewerage  regulations  have  been  prepared.  The \nCabinet is expected to endorse the Sewerage Regulations by 30 \nSeptember 2008. \n \nThe  commitment  to  improve  cost  recovery  and  sustainability  is \nevidenced  by  the  recent  approval  of  water  tariff  increases, \nenactment  of  the  public  bodies  bill  to  promote  sustainable \ncommercial  operations  for  public  enterprises,  and  review  of  the \nProject\u2019s  cost-recovery  issues.  Cabinet  endorsement  of  cost-\nrecovery  mechanisms  for  the  sewerage  system  and  the  septic \ntank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  is  a  condition  for \neffectiveness of supplementary financing. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fSAMOA\nSANITATION AND\nDRAINAGE PROJECT\n\nN\n\nMeters\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\n172  40'Wo\n\nFalealupo\n\n13  30'So\n\nMatavai\n\nSataua\n\nSafune\n\nSafotu\n\nFagamalo\n\nSamalaeulu\n\nFalelima\n\nSAVAI'I  ISLAND\n\nS A M O A\n\nSalailua\n\nPalauli\n\nPu'apu'a\n\nFaga\n\nTuasivi\n\nSalelologa\n\nTaga\n\nSatupaitea\n\nMulifanua\n\nApolima\n\nManono\n\nFale'ula\n\nFaleolo\n\nSatapuala\n\nPROJECT AREA\n\nAPIA\n\nFusi\n\nSolosolo\n\n171  30'Wo\n\nFalefa\n\nFalelatai\n\nUPOLU   ISLAND\n\nMatautu\n\nSalani\n\nSiumu\n\nPoutasi\n\nLotofaga\n\nP  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\n\n14  00'So\n\n172  40'Wo\n\n171  45'Wo\n\n171  30'Wo\n\n13  30'So\n\nTiavea\n\n14  00'So\nLalomanu\n\n171  30'Wo\n\nP A C I F I C    O C E A N\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant Site\n\nV a i u s u    B a y\n\nDrainage Improvement Work\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant\n\nFloodway Improvement Work\n\nPressure Sewers\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRiver\n\nVailoa\n\nLepea\n\nTulaele\n\no\n13  50'S\n\nC\n\na\n\ns\n\ne\n\nc\n\na\n\ns\n\ne\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nr\ne\nv\ni\nR\n \nu\ns\no\ni\na\nV\n\nFugalei\n\nm\na\ne\nr\nt\nS\n \na\ng\na\ns\nA\n\nVaimoso\n\nAPIA\n\nAPIA\nHARBOUR\n\nMatauta\n\nV\n\na\n\ni\n\ns\n\ni\n\ng\n\nNiue\n\na\n\nn\n\no\n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\ne\nr\n\nMalifa\n\nTufuiopa\n\nM\n\nuliv\n\nai \n\nR\n\niv\ne\n\nr\n\nLotopa\n\nSinamoga\n\nFogavai\n\no\n13  50'S\n\nVaivasetai\n\nMotootua\n\nMagiagitai\n\n171  45'Wo\n\n08-1875 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nsupplementary loan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Independent State of Samoa for the \nSanitation and Drainage Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nFollowing  a  request  from  the  Government  of  Samoa  in  February  2003,  the  Asian \n2. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved a loan for the Sanitation and Drainage Project (the Project). \nThe  loan  for  SDR5.604  million  ($8  million  equivalent)  was  approved  on  27  November  2003.1 \nThe request followed implementation of a technical assistance (TA) project2 for urban planning \nand management that identified infrastructure investments to improve the environmental quality \nof  Apia.  The  Project  is  the  first  phase  of  a  longer-term  urban  drainage  and  wastewater \nimprovement strategy. The loan and project agreements were signed on 1 June 2004 and the \nloan became effective on 30 August 2004. \n \n3. \nAfter  detailed  design  and  bidding  for  the  project  components  with  the  largest  expected \ncost, the Government asked ADB to provide supplementary financing to cover anticipated cost \noverruns. The Government informed ADB that it was unable to reduce the project scope without \ncompromising the project goals, and could not finance the cost overrun from its own resources \ndue to fiscal constraints. The Government also informed ADB that it was seeking the assistance \nof other international development partners to help meet the cost overrun through grants. The \nEuropean Union (EU) has approved grant financing for the construction of a wastewater sludge \ntreatment  facility  and  for  stream-flow  gauging  and  flood  modeling  to  assist  the  Government  in \nmeeting  the  project  cost  overrun.  The  EU  grants,  which  will  be  provided  as  parallel  financing, \nhave  reduced  the  estimated  cost  overrun  by  approximately  $2.1  million  from  $9.91  million  to \n$7.81  million.  With  the  exception  of  the  sludge  treatment  facility  and  the  stream-flow  gauging \nand flood modeling, which will now be financed by the EU, the project scope is unchanged. The \ncost  overrun  is  due  to  an  increase  in  the  original  cost  estimates.  The  revised  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nAs  a  result  of  increased  economic  activity  and  population  growth,  the  pressure  on \n4. \ndrainage  and  waste  water  infrastructure  in  Apia  has  become  more  critical.  The  economic, \nhealth, and environmental impacts of flooding and wastewater to the Apia community are now \nmore severe than in 2003 when the Project was approved. Efficient and effective drainage and \nwastewater  systems  in  Apia  are  urgently  required.  The  Project  remains  highly  relevant  and \nsupports the Government\u2019s water sector strategy.3 The Strategy for the Development of Samoa \n2008\u20132010 identifies the provisions of efficient and effective utility service and infrastructure as \nessential elements for economic growth, and specifically identifies the Project to help meet key \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n5. \nThe concept paper for supplementary financing of the Project was approved in February \n2008.

The \nstrategy includes a second phase of the Sanitation and Drainage Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n6. \nIn  greater  Apia,  which  has  a  population  of  approximately  60,000,  75%  of  households \nhave  septic  tank  systems;  but  many  are  too  small,  rarely  cleaned,  and  in  some  instances \ndischarge directly to the nearest drainage channel, polluting groundwater, surface streams, and \nthe  harbor.  In  the  central  business  area  and  special  needs  areas\u2014those  with  special \nwastewater  concerns  such  as  hospitals  and  major  school  compounds\u2014less  than  10%  of \nwastewater  is  adequately  treated.  The  hospitals  have  ineffective  on-site  sewage  treatment \nfacilities  as  do  most  commercial  centers  and  government  complexes.  The  situation  is \nexacerbated  by  the  historical  lack  of  urban  management  and  the  absence  of  effective  town \nplanning,  development  controls,  and  adequate  urban  drainage  and  wastewater  infrastructure. \nIndividuals have elevated their plots heights, reclaimed land in the mangrove area, and blocked \nnatural drainage paths. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified and foul-water flooding poses a \nhealth risk due to septage and latrine wastes being released to the surface environment.4 \n \nInadequate  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  systems  have  significantly \n7. \ndegraded  nearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream  water  quality  in  Apia.  Water  quality \nmonitoring  data 5  confirms  sewage  contamination  as  evidenced  by  low  dissolved  oxygen \nsaturation,  high  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  high  total  nitrogen  concentration,  and  high \nindicator  bacteria  concentration.  Urban  drains  are  often  choked  with  litter  and  vegetation,  foul \nsmelling\u2014indicating  anaerobic  conditions\u2014and  contain  floating  oil  and  sewage.  Drains  and \nnatural watercourses are contaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. \n \nSamoa  is  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  Severe  floods  were  reported  in  1939,  1975, \n8. \n2001, and 2003. In addition, localized flooding occurs annually. Damage of the 2001 flood was \nestimated at $4.4 million6 comprising $1.3 million in damage to infrastructure and $3.1 million of \ninsurance payout for mainly commercial damage. The actual costs are likely to be considerably \nhigher as most individual households do not have insurance. About 5,000 people were directly \naffected  by  the  flooding  and  about  28,000  experienced  water  shortages.  Businesses  were \nforced to close as the water supply network was damaged. Other impacts included the spilling \nof septic tanks with resulting environmental and health impacts. \n  \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n9. \nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  Apia\u2019s  environment  and  public  health \nthrough  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  infrastructure,  and  capacity  in  urban  management. \nProject  objectives  include  (i)  improve  public  health,  (ii)  improve  environmental  quality,  \n(iii)  improve  surface  and  groundwater  quality,  and  (iv)  reduce  frequency  of  flooding  in  specific \nlow-lying  areas.  A  special  feature  of  the  Project  is  private  sector  participation  through \n\n                                                 \n4   Septage is the discharge from on-site wastewater treatment facilities such as septic tanks and pit latrines. \n5   Monitoring  is  done  infrequently  and  usually  initiated  through  donor-funded  activities.  ADB  provided  assistance  to \nwater monitoring through (i) ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Drainage and \nWastewater  Management.  Manila;  (ii)  ADB.  1995.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  for \nIntegrated  Urban  Development  Projects.  Manila;  and  (iii)  ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Independent \nState of Samoa for Evaluation of Sewage Treatment Options. Manila. \n\n6   2001 prices. \n\n\foutsourcing  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  drainage  and  wastewater  services  to \nthe  private  sector.  The  Project  also  contributes  to  private  sector  development  through  the \nprovision of improved urban infrastructure and environment for businesses. \n \nThe  Project  has  three  components:  drainage  and  floodways,  wastewater  management \n10. \nand  sanitation,  and  capacity  building.  Project  outputs  include  (i)  drainage  and  floodways;  (ii) \nrehabilitated  drains;  (iii)  installation  of  water  gauges  for  flood  monitoring;  (iv)  design, \nconstruction, and operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system; (v) utility-managed \nindividual  sanitation  systems;  and  (vi)  strengthened  institutions  for  wastewater  management, \ndrainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n \n11. \nThe  drainage  and  floodways  component  mitigates  flooding  of  the  Gasegase  River, \nAsaga Stream Bypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the central business area, \nand  provides  data  required  for  the  development  of  a  broader  drainage  management  plan  to \nguide  future  improvements.  The  scope  of  the drainage  and  floodways  component  includes:  (i) \ndesign  and  channel  improvement  works,  including  de-silting,  channel  realignment,  and  bank \nstabilization, for: (a) approximately 900 meters (m) of the Gasegase River down stream of the \nVaimoso  Bridge;  (b)  approximately  450  m  of  the  Asaga  Stream  from  Fugalei  Street  to  the \nconfluence  of  the  Gasegase  River;  and  (c)  850  m  length  of  the  Asaga  Bypass  Stream  from \nFugalei  Street  to  the  confluence  of  the  Gasegase  River;  (ii)  design  and  construction  of \napproximately  2,570  m  of  pipe  drains  with  internal  diameters  ranging  from  450  mm  to  1,600 \nmm; (iii) rehabilitation,  including  removal  of  debris  and  bank  stabilization, of approximately \n360  m  of  existing  open  drain;  (iv)  installation  of  water  gauging  stations  to  monitor  flood  flows \nand provide data for hydraulic modeling and further drainage design (to be funded by the EU); \nand  (v)  undertaking  topographical  and  cadastral  surveys  to  establish  correct  levels  in  the \nfloodplain  and  low-lying  area  and  hydraulic  modeling  of  flood  flows  (to  be  funded  by  the  EU). \nThe  topographical  and  cadastral  surveys  will  establish  levels  in  the  floodplain  and  low-lying \nareas,  support  hydraulic  modeling  of  flood  flows,  and  guide  the  design  and  implementation  of \ncivil works. \n \n12. \nwastewater and sanitation needs in urban Apia through the following components: \n \n\nThe  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  component  addresses  the  immediate \n\n(i) \n\nIndividual System Rehabilitation and Septage Collection and Treatment Program \nincluding (a) implementation of the Septic Tank Rehabilitation and Replacement \nProgram  including  the  provision  of  septage  collection  services  and  repair  and \nreplacement  of  septic  tanks  to  approximately  8,000  households  in  the  Greater \nApia area; and (b) a detailed sanitary survey; and (c) a sludge treatment facility to \nbe located at the Tafaigata landfill (to be funded by the EU); and \n\n \n(ii)   CBA  and  SNA  Sewerage  System  including:  (a)  design  and  construction  of \napproximately  8,450  m  of  pressure  sewers  inclusive  of  all  sewage  pumps, \ntraining  of  SWA  personnel  for  systems  maintenance,  and  an  extended  defects \nliability  period  of  540  days;  and  (b)  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  a \nsequencing batch reactor wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Sogi, inclusive \nof  effluent  disinfection \ntreatment  capacity  of \nfacilities,  with  an  nominal \n1,000 m3/day. \n\n \nThe  capacity  development  component  provides  capacity  development  in  technical  and \n13. \nmanagement  areas  as  well  as  community  awareness  programs.  Capacity  development  will \nmainly  be  provided  to  SWA;  Ministry  of  Works,  Transport,  and  Infrastructure  (MWTI);  and \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nPlanning  and  Urban  Management  Agency  (PUMA)  for  (i)  capacity  building  in  technical  and \nmanagement  areas  through  identifying  training  needs  and  developing  training  programs; \n(ii) assistance  for  establishment  and  conduct  of  a  twinning  arrangement  for  SWA  with  a  well-\nfunctioning wastewater utility, or similar organization; (iii) community awareness programs in the \nkey  areas  such  as  (a)  need  for  new  infrastructure  and  new  practices,  including  the \nenvironmental implications of unsafe sanitation and drainage practices, (b) application of good \non-site  planning  principles  and  practices  for  sanitation  and  drainage,  (c)  on-site  sanitation \ndesign, operations and maintenance, including where to seek technical assistance and advice, \n(d)  the  responsibilities  of  Government,  households  and  individuals  in  regard  to  sanitation  and \ndrainage, (e) safe wastewater practices; and (iv) Project implementation assistance. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n14. \nThe  project  investment  cost  was  estimated  at  $10  million,  excluding  taxes  and  duties \n(Table  1).  The  cost  estimates  included  land  acquisition,  physical  works,  consulting  services, \nadministration, contingencies, and financing charges during implementation. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Original Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem  \nA.

The loan has a 32-year term including a grace period of \n8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  beneficiary  is  the \nIndependent  State  of  Samoa.  The  loan  was  approved  on  27  November  2003  and  became \neffective  on  30  August  2004.  A  portion  of  the  loan  ($3.5  million  equivalent)  is  relent  by  the \nGovernment to SWA. The relending has a 32-year term including a grace period of 5 years, and \ninterest  of  5%  per  annum,  and  other  such  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  subsidiary \nfinancing agreement between the Government and SWA. The Government assumes the foreign \nexchange  risk  and  provides  $2.0  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  as  counterpart  financing. \nThe financing plan is shown in Table 2. \n \n \n \n\n\fTable 2: Original Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nSources Exchange \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n8.0 \n2.0 \n10.0 \n\nPercent \n80 \n20 \n100 \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  steering  committee \n16. \n(PSC),  established  in  January  2005,  serves  as  a  joint  water  sector  steering  committee  to \nprovide guidance and oversight of water sector projects. Members of the joint PSC include the \nchief executive officers of MOF, MWTI, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry \nof Health; Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry for Women, Community and Social Development, the \ngeneral managers of the Electrical Power Corporation and the Samoa Water Authority (SWA); a \nrepresentative from the Samoa Umbrella Non Government Organization, and the Sanitation and \nDrainage  Project  and  Water  Sector  Support  Program  project  management  unit  (PMU)  project \nmanagers.7 A subcommittee, which meets on a monthly basis, was formed to provide technical \ndirection  for  the  Project.  The  implementing  agencies  are MWTI  for  the  drainage  and  floodway \ncomponent,  and  SWA  for  the  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  component.  PUMA \nremains directly engaged in both components as part of its responsibility for urban management \nand planning. \n \n17. \nThe  PMU  is  staffed  by  a  Samoan  consulting  firm,  and  coordinates  project  activities; \nmonitors overall project progress; and manages project accounts, procurement, and reporting. It \nreports  directly  to  the  PSC.  The  PMU  has  been  effective  and  efficient  in  its  coordination, \nmonitoring, and management of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n18. \nProject  implementation  is  delayed  by  about  24  months.  At  appraisal,  the  Project  was \nenvisaged  to  be  implemented  over  2.5  years,  commencing  in  March  2004.  The  Project \neffectively  commenced  in  November  2005  when  the  PMU  consultants  were  fielded.  The  Loan \nAgreement  specified  a  loan  closing  date  of  30  June  2009.  The  implementation  delay  is \nattributed  to  a  number  of  factors  including  delay  in  loan  signing,  late  recruitment  of  project \nimplementation  assistance  (PIA)  consultants,  and  the  need  to  rebid  major  contracts.  Despite \ninitial  delays,  project  progress  is  satisfactory.  Overall  project  progress  is  estimated  at  42%  as \ncompared  to  the  overall  elapsed  period  of  project  implementation  of  77%.  A  chronology  of \nsignificant project events is in Appendix 2. \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n19. \nProcurement of the Project\u2019s major components is complete. Contracts for the drainage \nand  floodways,  and  pressure  sewers  have  been  awarded.  The  contract  for  the  WWTP  was \nsigned  on  30  May  2008.  Bidding  for  the  contracts  followed  international  competitive  biding \n\n                                                 \n7   The  Water  Sector  Support  Program,  funded  by  the  EU,  supports  water  supply  and  sanitation  development  in \n\nSamoa\u2019s rural areas. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nmethods using the standard ADB Plant-design, supply, and install bid documents. A rebidding \nprocess was undertaken for the floodway and drainage, pressure sewers, and WWTP contracts \nas bids were either noncompliant or included excessive bid prices. ADB has approved financing \nof $7.52 million for contract awards as of 6 May 2008. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n20. \nTo  strengthen  project  management  of  the  implementing  agencies  and  PUMA,  PMU \nconsultants  were  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The PMU consultants were fielded in November 2005. \nPIA consultants were appointed in February 2006 to help the implementing agencies design and \nimplement the project components.8 \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n21. \nThe  loan  proceeds  are  being  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  imprest  account  for  the  Project  was \nestablished  after  loan  effectiveness.  Replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  is  supported  by \nwithdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedures  applies  to  reimbursement  for  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidation  of  the  imprest \naccount.  The  SOE  procedures  are  applicable  to  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $50,000. \nDisbursements as of 6 May 2008 amounted to $1.767 million representing 19.62% of the loan \namount  including  capitalized  financing  charges  of  $0.232  million.  The  loan  imprest  account \nturnover  ratio  is  1.87.  The  equivalent  current  net  value  of  the  loan,  which  is  denominated  in \nSDR,  has  appreciated  from  $8,000,000.00  when  the  loan  was  negotiated  in  October  2003  to \n$9,002,422.87 as of 6 May 2008. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n22. \nThe  PMU  is  responsible  for  preparing  quarterly  project  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation,  and  for  maintaining  separate  accounts  and  records  of  expenditures  for  the \nProject. Externally-audited project accounts and financial statements are submitted to ADB on \nan annual basis. ADB has been provided with the quarterly progress reports on a timely basis. \nSubmission  of  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  2006  audited  project  accounts  to  ADB  was  delayed  by  6 \nmonths; however, the FY2007 audited project accounts were submitted to ADB prior to the due \ndate. The submission of audited financial statements for SWA has been erratic with delays of up \nto  14  months.9 More  recently,  the  timeliness  of  submissions  has  improved  and  the  FY2007 \naudited financial statements were submitted 4 days after the due date (31 March 2008). \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n23. \nA project performance management system, including baseline data, was established to \nfacilitate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  key  performance  indicators.  The  indicators \ncomprise  service  levels,  treated  wastewater  quality,  and  other  measures  of  operating \nperformance; percentage of wastewater collected and treated; user satisfaction with the urban \nenvironment; and relevant health, environmental and economic data to monitor project impacts.  \n\n                                                 \n8   The PIA consultants\u2019 inputs included design and supervision of civil works components, training of SWA and MWTI \npersonnel  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  drainage  and  wastewater  systems,  financial  analysis  of  SWA\u2019s \nwastewater operations including preparation of a review of the wastewater tariffs and design, and implementation \nof community awareness and education programs. \n\n9   The FY2005 audited financial statements were submitted 14.1 months late. \n\n\f8. \n\nProject Review \n\n24. \nProject  review  missions  are  fielded  at  6-month  intervals.  The  Inception  Mission  was \nfielded from 10 to 18 October 2004 and the Midterm Review Mission from 25 March to 4 April \n2008. \n \nF. \n\nRelated Technical Assistance \n\nA  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  the  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Drainage  and \n25. \nWastewater  Management  was  approved  together  with  the  original  loan. 10  The  Treasury \nDepartment  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA;  PUMA  is  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  TA \nprovided 11 person-months of international and 13 person-months of national consultant inputs \nto  provide  institutional  strengthening  of  PUMA,  SWA,  and  MWTI  in  drainage  and  wastewater \nmanagement. Specific components of the TA included preparation of drainage and wastewater \nmaster plans, capacity building in drainage and wastewater planning, review and amendment of \nthe  national  standards  for  on-site  sewage  treatment,  drafting  of  sewerage  regulations,  and \ndevelopment  of  a  geographic  information  system  for  urban  planning  purposes.  The  TA  was \ncompleted  in  January  2008  and  closed  in  May  2008.  The  TA  objectives  and  planned  outputs \nwere fully achieved. Total disbursements for the TA amounted to $393,151 or 98.3% of the TA \ngrant of $400,000. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\n26. \nThe estimated cost to implement the Project has risen significantly as a consequence of \nthe  project  implementation  delay.  The  implementation  schedule  envisaged  at  appraisal  may \nhave  contributed  to  an  initial  underestimation  of  costs.  Investment  costs,  excluding  costs \nassociated with the sludge treatment facility, flow gauging, and flood modeling,11 are estimated \nat $17.81 million, as compared to $10.00 million at appraisal. The impact of delays on project \ncosts  can  be  attributed  to  (i)  weakening  of  the  US  dollar  against  the  currencies  of  bidders  for \nmajor  contracts  and  weakening  of  the  US  dollar  against  the  euro  where  some  equipment  is \nsourced, 12 (ii)  wage  increases,  and  (iii)  substantial  increases  in  price  of  materials  and  fuel \ncosts.13 The impact of these factors on project costs are reinforced by increased prices due to a \nbooming construction market in Australia and New Zealand.14 \n \nAn  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  impacts  of  a  weaker  US  dollar,  wage \n27. \nincreases, and rising material prices on bid prices for the contracts that have already been bid.15 \nThe  cumulative  value  of  the  contracts  already  awarded  is  $13.7  million  compared  with  the \nappraisal cost estimate of $6.0 million for the same contracts. The depreciation of the US dollar \nagainst  the  currencies  of  the  bidders  accounted  for  $0.98  million  of  the  cost  overrun,  wage \nincreases accounted for $0.71 million, and material cost increases accounted for $1.14 million. \nOther  factors  that  contributed  $3.98  million  to  the  cost  overrun  are  booming  construction \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Institutional Strengthening for Drainage \n\nand Wastewater Management. Manila (TA 4229-SAM, for $400,000). \n\n11  Financed by the European Union. \n12  The US dollar weakened by more than 20% against the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, and by 15% \nagainst  the  Samoan  tala  between  September  2003  (time  of  appraisal)  and  August  2007  (when  major  bids  were \nsubmitted). The US dollar depreciated by about 17% against the euro during the same time period. \n13  Material and consumable price increases include oil by 110%, steel by 109%, and plastic pipes by 45%. \n14  This particularly impacts the cost of expert personnel from Australia and New Zealand. \n15  The contracts that have already been bid represent 74% of the revised cost estimate. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nmarkets  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  underestimation  of  sewer  system  construction  costs \nduring project appraisal, and the need to extend the PMU and PIA consultancy contracts due to \nthe delayed implementation. Details of the cost overrun analysis are in Appendix 3. \n \n28.  With major contracts awarded, the risk of further cost overruns is small. Cost estimates \nfor the other components have taken into account current construction market conditions. With \nadvance  procurement  action  to  support  timely  implementation  of  the  remaining  components, \nprices are expected to remain at estimated costs.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n29.  With  estimated  cost  overruns,  the  approved  financing  for  the  Project  is  insufficient  to \ncover  the  costs  to  achieve  the  objectives  and  outputs.  A  reduction  in  the  project  scope  is  not \npossible  as  the  wastewater  components  (the  sewerage  system  and  the  O&M  program  for \nindividual systems) are essential to achieve improved public health and environmental impacts, \nand the sewerage system components (the sewer network and the WWTP) are interdependent \nand cannot function independently. The estimated cost overrun for implementation of the project \ncomponents  (as  defined  under  the  original  Project),  with  the  exception  of  the  EU-financed \ncomponents, amounts to $7.81 million. The EU grants have reduced the estimated cost overrun \nby approximately $2.1 million, from $9.91 million to $7.81 million. \n \n30. \nDespite  significant  cost  overruns,  the  project  components  remain  economically  viable. \nThe Project is key in improving public health and the environment in Apia, and will help reduce \neconomic costs resulting from flooding. The contribution from tourism-related activities to gross \ndomestic  product  has  increased  from  41%  in  2003  to  over  48%  in  2006.  The  continued \ndevelopment  of  the  tourism  sector  is  highly  dependent  on  sustainable  resource  management \nand a clean environment. The Project will indirectly contribute to sustained economic growth by \nimproving the environment for expansion of the tourism industry. \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\n31. \nImplementation  Delays.  A  number  of  lessons  are  evident  from  ADB  support  for \ninfrastructure  development  projects  in  Samoa.  Cost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to \ndelays in implementation. Deferred loan effectiveness, and technical and procurement aspects \nhave been the major contributing factors to delays in project implementation. The risk of delays \nin project implementation and associated cost overruns for projects needs to be identified during \nproject preparation. The preparation of bid documents during project preparation will reduce the \nrisk of project implementation delays.  \n \n32. \nCost  Estimates.  Samoa  is  reliant  on  international  markets,  particularly  for  civil  works \ncontracts  in  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  and  the  preparation  of  accurate  cost  estimates  is \ndifficult as external factors, which are difficult to gauge, often directly impact on costs in Samoa. \nPhysical contingencies must be sufficient to allow for technical uncertainties, and the selection \nof procurement methods must consider the capacity of implementing agencies to manage and \ncoordinate contracts, and their ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n \nD. \n\nRationale \n\nThe original project rationale remains valid; effective drainage and wastewater systems \n33. \nin  Apia  are  urgently  required.  Due  to  climate  change,  Samoa  is  experiencing  increased \nexposure to natural disasters. With increased economic activity and population growth in Apia, \n\n\fthe  economic,  health,  and  environmental  impacts  are  more  severe  than  in  2003  when  the \nProject  was  approved.  Apia  experienced  two  additional  severe  flooding  events  in  2006  and \n2008. While Samoa has experienced stable economic growth, the impact of the 2006 flood was \nsevere and contributed to a sharp reduction in economic growth.16 The importance of mitigation, \nprevention, and climate change adaptation has become more critical and more recognized since \nthe  Project  was  first  approved  in  2003.  The  Project  forms  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  identified \nmitigation measures to improve readiness for natural disasters.  \n \nThe Project supports ADB\u2019s water policy17 by (i) improving and expanding the delivery of \n34. \nwastewater  services;  and  (ii)  increasing  wastewater  service  efficiencies  and  sustainability \nthrough  the  introduction  of  sewerage  tariffs  and  environmental  charges,  and  increased  public \nawareness. \n \n35. \n\nThe Project is eligible for supplementary financing under ADB\u2019s policy criteria as: \n(i) \n\nthe  Project  is  specifically  identified  as  a  high-priority  activity  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008\u20132010, \nsupplementary financing will help achieve the project objectives and benefits, \nsupplementary financing was not previously provided, and \nthe  amount  of  supplementary  financing  will  not  exceed  the  original  financing \napproved by ADB. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \nE. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n36. \nRevolving  Fund.  A  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  (the  revolving \nfund) will be established under the Project. The program, to be provided by SWA, will improve \nApia\u2019s environment and public health through more effective management of sewage generated \nin areas not served by the central business area wastewater management system. The program \nwill  provide  regular  pump-outs  of  septic  tanks,  initially  on  a  2-year  cycle,  and  replace \napproximately  400  septic  tanks  per  year  so  that  8,000  premises18 in  greater  Apia  receive  new \nseptic tanks over a 20-year period. The program will be financed under the revolving fund, with \nthe  initial  capital  injection  of  $900,000  financed  by  the  supplementary  financing.  The  initial \ncapital injection will finance a consultancy to design and implement the septic tank maintenance \nand  replacement  program,  and  the  replacement  of  500  septic  tanks.  SWA  will  outsource  the \nprogram\u2019s  operation  and  management  activities.  The  relatively  small  size  of  the  program  will \nenable  national  consultants  and  contractors  to  participate  and  avoid  the  need  to  develop \ncomplex  outsourcing  agreements.  The  scale  and  operating  cost  will  be  assessed  under  the \nconsultancy to design and implement during program implementation. \n \n37. \nSWA will collect user charges (environmental charge) for full recovery of the investment \ncosts  and  O&M  costs  of  the  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program,  and  debt \nservice,  as  well  as  a  rate  of  return  to  be  agreed  upon  between  MOF  and  SWA.  The \nenvironmental charges and user tariffs for the forthcoming fiscal year will be reviewed annually \nfor Cabinet consideration for the duration of the Project with the first review becoming effective \non  1  July  2009.  As  a  condition  for  effectiveness  for  supplementary  financing,  the  Cabinet  will \npass  a  resolution  approving  a  cost  recovery  mechanism  (the  \u201cCost  Recovery  Mechanism\u201d) \nproviding  until  the  Closing  Date  for  the  full  cost  recovery  of:  (i)  the  investment  costs  and  the \noperations  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  the  septic  tank  subcomponent  through  an \n                                                 \n16  Gross domestic product growth decreased from 5.1% in 2005 to 2.6% in 2006. \n17  ADB. 2003.

A  comprehensive  community  awareness  program \nwas  developed  and  is  being  implemented  with  the  direct  involvement  of  the  community.  The \nprogram  assesses  the  education  and  information  needs  of  the  community  and  identifies  the \nspecial  needs  of  low-income  and  vulnerable  households.  The  program  is  delivering  targeted \ninformation  about  the  Project  and  its  impacts,  specifically  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the \nGovernment,  households,  organizations,  and  communities;  and  general  information  about \nrelated  environmental  and  health  issues.  The  community  awareness  program  will  inform  the \ncommunity  of  costs  associated  with  delivery  of  the  sanitation  services  and  the  need  for  user \ncharges. \n \n39. \nAid  Coordination.  ADB  and  the  EU  are  collaborating  to  improve  water  supply  and \nwastewater  services  in  Samoa.  The  EU  is  supporting  SWA  with  investments  to  enhance \nefficiency  and  quality  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  rural  areas  through  a  water \nsector  support  program  project.  As  part  of  its  engagement,  the  EU  is  supporting  the \nGovernment  with  a  water  tariff  review  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  EU  has  assisted  the \nGovernment in addressing the Project\u2019s cost overrun by providing grants for the construction of \na  wastewater  sludge  treatment  facility  at  Tafaigata,  near  Apia,  and  undertaking  topographical \nand  cadastral  surveys  to  establish  correct  levels  in  the  floodplain  and  low-lying  area  and \nhydraulic modeling of flood flows. \n \nF. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n\n40. \nSamoa\u2019s  overall  public  sector  debt  position  has  been  improving  since  the  early  1990s \nfrom over 100% of gross domestic product to about 43% in 2003. The debt to gross domestic \nproduct  ratio  improved  to  about  38%  in  late  2006.  While  Samoa  has  experienced  an  average \nannual  growth  rate  of  about  3.6%  since  2003,  economic  growth  remains  highly  vulnerable  to \nclimatic  and  global  price  shocks.  This  is  evidenced  by  the  economic  downturn  in  2006  as  a \nresult  of  floods  and  by  the  key  underlying  factors  for  the  cost  increases  of  the  Project.  The \nproposed  grant  of  $2.22  million  will  ease  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  supplementary \nfinancing requirements for the Project.  \n \nG. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n41. \nThe  revised  total  investment  cost  for  implementation  of  the  project  components  as \ndefined  under  the  original  Project,  with  the  exception  of  components  financed  by  the  EU,  is \nestimated  at  $17.81  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $2.17  million.  Financing \ncharges  during  implementation  are  estimated  at  $0.57  million.  The  revised  cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and detailed in Appendix 4. \n \n\n\fH. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n42. \nThe Government has requested a supplementary loan of SDR 1.71 million and a grant of \n$2.22  million,  both  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  to  help  finance  the  cost  overrun  of  the \nProject. The supplementary loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand  interest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5%  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the Financing Agreement and the amended Project Agreement. \n \nThe  loan  and  grant  will  be  provided  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa.  The \n43. \nGovernment will relend a portion of the loan and grant to SWA. The relending will have a 30-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 5% per annum and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the amended Subsidiary Financing Agreement between \nthe  Government  and  SWA.19 The  Government  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk  arising \nfrom the loan. \n \n\nTable 3: Revised Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nItem \n \nA.

Approval of retroactive financing will facilitate timely implementation of \nthe  Project  by  allowing  contract  awards  prior  to  approval  of  the  supplementary  financing.  To \nensure  that  project  implementation  capacity  remains  within  the  implementing  agencies,  the \nPMU consultants will be retained until project completion. The scope of the PIA consultants will \nbe varied to enable full-time construction, supervision, and contract administration. \n \nJ. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  existing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  in  terms  of  (i)  project \n47. \nmanagement;  (ii)  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting;  and  (iii)  project  performance  monitoring \nand  evaluation  are  considered  adequate  and  will  remain  unchanged.  Project  review  missions \nwill  continue  to  be  undertaken  on  a  6-monthly  basis.  MOF  will  provide  ADB  with  a  project \ncompletion report within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n1. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe closing date for the loan will be extended from 30 June 2009 to 31 December 2010. \n\n48. \nThe revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nThe equipment, material, and works financed by the proceeds of the ADB loan and grant \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nare included in all contracts. Requirements of environmental monitoring and management plans \nare reflected in all civil works bid and contract documents. The updated procurement plan and \ncontract packages are detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nThe  PMU  consultants  were  recruited  in  November  2004,  their  contract  expired  on  30 \nJune  2008.  The  PIA  consultants  were  recruited  in  May  2006  and  their  contract  expires  on  31 \nDecember 2008. The PMU and the PIA consultants have performed well and their services are \nneeded  for  the  duration  of  project  implementation.  The  PMU  and  the  PIA  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  using  single  source  selection.  Consultants  required  for  the  septic  tank  maintenance \n\n\fand  replacement  program  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n51. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) are included in \nthe  financing  agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular, all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n52. \nTo  facilitate  timely  project  implementation,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action \nand  retroactive  financing  for  procurement  of  goods,  equipment  and  services,  consulting \nservices,  and  civil  works  contracts.  Advance  procurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  will \nalso  apply  to  the  WWTP,  which  is  being  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  Up  to  20%  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds  are  eligible  for  retroactive  financing. \nRetroactive financing is applicable to eligible expenditures, which must be incurred before loan \neffectiveness,  but  generally  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  signing  of  the  financing  and \nproject  agreements.  The  Government  and  SWA  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nThe proceeds of the supplementary loan and grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation, \nMOF  will  open  separate  imprest  accounts  for  (a)  the  supplementary  loan  and  (b)  the  grant \nimmediately  after  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  exclusively  used  to  finance  the \nADB  share  of  eligible  expenditures  applicable  to  the  supplementary  financing.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  accounts  or  10%  of  the  loan  or  grant  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  direct  payment  procedure  will  apply  for  contracts  awarded  under \ninternational competitive bidding. If the Government initially funds eligible expenditures from its \nown resources, the reimbursement procedures will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify \ndocumentation process, the SOE procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest \naccount and reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per individual payment. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for project components financed \n54. \nthrough  the  approved  loan  and  supplementary  financing.  Separate  audits  of  the  project \naccounts and financial statements for components financed under (i) the approved loan, and (ii) \nthe supplementary financing will be done annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nMOF will provide ADB with copies of the audited project accounts and financial statements for \nboth the approved loan and supplementary financing no later than 9 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. The audit reports will include a separate opinion on the use of \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nthe  imprest  accounts  and  SOE  procedures.  MOF  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress \nreports on project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, MOF \nwill provide ADB with a project completion report. The PMU will compile progress reports. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe economic analyses were reappraised for the drainage and floodway component and \n55. \nsewerage system. In the absence of investments in the drainage component, the status quo is \nassumed  to  continue.  Benefits  were  evaluated  in  terms  of  economic  cost  savings  associated \nwith  damage  to  structures,  infrastructure,  and  goods  in  central  Apia  that  would  continue  to  be \nincurred  as  a  result  of  flooding. 20  Health  benefits  and  potential  benefits  associated  with \nincreased  standards  of  living  and  commercial  activities  resulting  from  a  cleaner  environment \nwere  not  quantified  for  the  purposes  of  the  economic  analyses.  While  the  health  benefits\u2014\nincluding  reduced  incidence  of  typhoid,  infant  diarrhea,  dengue,  and  leptospirosis\u2014and \nenvironmental  benefits  are  large  and  identified  as  key  impacts  of  the  drainage  and  floodway \ncomponent, they are difficult to quantify and evaluate in terms of economic costs. \n \n56. \nThe benefits for the centralized sewerage system were evaluated in terms of economic \ncost  savings  as  compared  to  the  alternative  investment  scenario.  The  sewerage  system  will \nserve about 150 commercial and government premises in the central business district in Apia. \nThe  alternative  to  the  sewerage  system  is  to  continue  to  serve  these  costumers  with  a \ndecentralized  system  of  individual  septic  tanks  for  small  consumers  and  small  package  plants \nfor larger consumers. The septic tanks and small package plants are assumed to be operated \nand  maintained  to  meet  the  same  environmental  and  health  standards  as  under  the  project \ninvestment scenario. \n  \nThe  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  a  period  of  30  years,  including  an \n57. \ninvestment  period  of  5  years.  Taxes  and  duties  were  excluded  from  all  costs.  Economic \ninvestment  costs  include  the  original  cost  estimates  and  estimated  cost  overruns  of  \nST2.39  million  ($0.96  million)  for  the  drainage  and  floodway  component,  and  ST11.10  million \n($4.44 million) for the sewerage system. The economic analyses yield economic internal rates \nof return of 13.2% for the drainage component and 16.5% for the wastewater component. The \nrates  of  return  remain  robust  with  respect  to  changes  in  key  assumptions  and  risks.  Risk  of \nfurther  delays  and  cost  increases  is  negligible  as  implementation  is  advanced.  Sustainability \nthroughout  the  life  of  the  Project  is  ensured  through  the  funding  mechanism  for  O&M  of  the \nwastewater component. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 7. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n58. \nAn  assessment  of  cost-recovery  and  user  charges  was  undertaken  to  ensure \nsustainability  for  the  sewerage  system,  and  the  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement \nprogram. SWA will conduct reviews of cost recovery and submit user charges to Cabinet on an \nannual basis.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20  Average annual flood damage was estimated based on data on damage costs from the 2001 and 2006 floods. For \nsevere  flood  events  (1:20  flooding  events),  the  analysis  conservatively  assumes  that  only  50%  of  damage  costs \ncan be attributed to lack of drainage.   \n\n\fSewerage  System.  Cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries  will  be  achieved  through  the \n59. \napplication of a wastewater tariff for those connected to the sewerage system. The tariff will be \nset on the basis of metered water consumption and applied by SWA as a separate line item on \ncustomers\u2019 water bills. At a minimum, the sewerage tariff will be set sufficient to cover the costs \nof O&M and management. Any gap between actual tariffs and those required to achieve full cost \nrecovery  will  be  funded  by  the  Government  as  a  community  service  obligation.21 Details  of \nanalysis of cost-recovery mechanisms and user charges are in Appendix 8. \n \nSeptic  Tank  Maintenance  and  Replacement  Program.  The  program  includes  initial \n60. \ncapital  to  finance  500  tanks  immediately  and,  as  part  of  a  revolving  fund,  it  will  finance  the \nreplacement of approximately 400  septic tanks per year so that the 8,000 premises in greater \nApia receive new septic tanks over 20 years. Beyond the initial capital injection from the Project, \nthe  program  will  be  funded  by  an  environmental  charge  to  be  levied  on  all  8,000  premises \nreceiving  services  under  the  program.  The  environmental  charge  will  be  set  on  the  basis  of \nmetered water consumption or alternatively as a fixed amount. This fee will be included on the \nSWA  water  bill  as  a  separate  line  item.  At  a  minimum,  the  environmental  charge  will  be \nsufficient  to  cover  the  costs  of  O&M  and  management  of  the  program.  The  Government  will \ncover all costs for annual capital expenditures for septic tank replacement that are not covered \nby  the  environmental  charge.  Charges  were  estimated  under  two  alternative  cost-recovery \nobjectives:  (i)  coverage  of  O&M  and  management  costs;  and,  (ii)  coverage  of  O&M  and \nmanagement costs, as well as annual capital expenditure requirements. \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Resettlement Impacts \n\nA  social  analysis  undertaken  during  project  preparation22 concluded  that  some  of  the \n61. \npoorest  households  in  Apia  are  located  in  low-lying  areas  identified  in  the  project  design  for \nsanitation  facility  rehabilitation.  They  will  benefit  from  improved  living  conditions  and  reduced \nhealth  risks.  Short  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  and  updated  during \nthe Project\u2019s detailed design phase. The project land acquisition activities are complete and no \nfurther  land  acquisition  requirement  is  anticipated.  Interventions  to  address  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998)  are  not  required  as  the  indigenous  population  makes  up  the \nmainstream  society  within  Samoa;  no  social  or  cultural  identities  are  \"distinct  from  that  of  the \ndominant or mainstream society.\" The updated summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 9. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n62. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Project  was  completed  and  confirms  the \nclassification as category B. The Project\u2019s overall environmental effects are positive. The Project \nwill (i) improve surface and groundwater quality, including marine waters, by reducing untreated \nand  partially  treated  sewage  discharges  to  the  environment;  (ii)  improve  public  health  by \nreducing  sewage  and  decreasing  flooding;  and  (iii)  reduce  solid  waste  to  urban  streams  and \nmarine  waters  by  improving  drainage  system  management.  Effluent  from  the  WWTP  will  be \ndischarged into the earth via infiltration trenches to avoid direct discharge of WWTP effluent to \nmangroves  adjacent  to  the  WWTP  site.  Stringent  discharge  criteria  for  the  WWTP  will  ensure \nthat  effluent  has  negligible  impact  on  the  mangroves  and  Vaiusu  Bay.  An  environmental \nassessment  for  the  overall  Project  was  prepared  and  approved  by  PUMA,  and  is  updated \n                                                 \n21  Community service obligations are Government-mandated services provided by public utilities to achieve broader \n\neconomic, environmental, and social objectives. \n\n22  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for the Implementation of the Planning and \n\nUrban Management Strategy. Manila (TA 3860-SAM). \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nperiodically  to  reflect  refinements  of  component  designs  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement plans (EMPs). Civil works for the Project have only recently commenced and the \neffectiveness  of  the  Project\u2019s  EMPs  cannot  yet  be  assessed.  However,  adjustments  to  the \nEMPs will not likely be required. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nthroughout  project \n\nthe  Government  and  SWA \n\n63. \nCommitment  to  Sustainable  Urban  Management. The Government demonstrates its \ncommitment to the Project and overall urban management through the establishment of PUMA, \npromulgation  of  the  Planning  and  Urban  Management  Bill,  and  efforts  to  develop  this  Project. \nBusiness  community  support  and  participation  have  been  fostered  through  ongoing  dialogue \nwith  the  business  community  during  project  development  and  implementation.  Community \nconsultations  are  undertaken  as  an  integral  part  of  project  implementation.  The  Project \nemphasizes  the  importance  of  building  community  and  other  stakeholder  awareness  as \ncommitment  to  the  Project,  as  well  as  building  SWA  and  government  responsiveness  to  the \ncommunity\u2019s  needs  and  views.  To  enhance  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  the  capacity \ndevelopment  measures,  the  project  capacity  development  components  include  significant \ninteraction  with \nimplementation.  The \nestablishment and funding of a twinning arrangement for SWA with a well-established utility will \npromote long-term capacity development. \n \n64. \nCommitment and Availability of Financial Resources for O&M of the Drainage and \nWastewater  Infrastructure. The Government and SWA have demonstrated their commitment \nto improve  cost recovery through recent water tariff increases, enactment of the public bodies \nbill  to  promote  sustainable  commercial  operations  for  public  enterprises,  and  review  of  the \nProject\u2019s  cost-recovery  issues.  Cabinet  endorsement  of  cost-recovery  mechanisms  for  the \nsewerage system, and the septic tank maintenance and replacement program is a condition for \neffectiveness of supplementary financing. \n \n65. \nCommunity Opposition to Land Acquisition for the Project. Land acquisition for the \nProject  is  now  complete,  and  additional  land  acquisition  is  not  anticipated.  Extensive \nconsultations with the community have been undertaken and will continue for the duration of the \nProject to keep the public informed of project activities and impacts. An updated land acquisition \nand resettlement plan was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in May 2008.  \n \n66. \nIssuance  of  Sewerage  Regulations. Draft sewerage regulations were prepared under \nthe  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Drainage  and  Wastewater  Management  TA  (footnote  10) \nfollowing consultations with key stakeholders including SWA, PUMA, and Office of the Attorney \nGeneral.

The  contract  was  procured  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  and  requirements  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nSamoa  is  a  small  and  highly  import-dependent  country  that  relies  largely  on  official \n1. \ntransfers  and  remittances  for  foreign  currency  revenues.  The  country  is  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange and natural disasters. Despite these vulnerabilities, it has experienced stable economic \ngrowth over the last 5 years. Growth of real gross domestic product averaged 3.6% per annum, \nwell above the average growth rate of Pacific region economies. The annual long-term growth \nrate  is  expected  to  be  around  3.5%.  Economic  growth  is  mainly  driven  by  agriculture, \nconstruction,  finance,  and  business  services.  The  main  growth  center  is  Apia.  Samoa  is  also \nbenefiting from an increase in tourism. Increasing economic activity and developing the private \nsector  are  key  strategies  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Government  is \nalso  placing  increased  emphasis  on  climate  change  adaptation  to  improve  the  protection  of \ninfrastructure assets, and reduce the economic and social impacts of natural disasters. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2008\u20132010  lays  the \n2. \nfoundation  for  sustainable  and  broad-based  economic  growth  supported  by  continued  reforms \nand  private  sector  development  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  all  people  in  Samoa.  The \nprovision of sufficient basic infrastructure services and reduction of the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nexternal shocks are essential to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth.  \n \n3. \nUrban Apia currently lacks an efficient drainage system. Severe floods were recorded in \n1939, 1975, 2001, 2003, and 2006. In addition, localized flooding occurs annually. The damage \nto  structures,  and  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  from  flooding  have  significantly \ndisrupted  economic  activity  and  impacted  standards  of  living.  The  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters is evidenced by the sharp reduction in economic growth from 5.1% in 2005 to 2.6% in \n2006,  when  a  severe  flood  occurred.  This  situation  is  compounded  by  lack  of  an  efficient  and \ncentralized system for wastewater management. The Country Environmental Analysis: Samoa1 \nidentified  the  need  to  address  the  high  solid  waste  generation  and  inadequate  waste \nmanagement  practices.  The  Sanitation  and  Drainage  Project  (the  Project)  was  identified  to \nimprove Apia\u2019s environment and public health to meet the objectives of the Government\u2019s water \nsector plan.2  \n \n4. \nThe Project has experienced significant cost overruns as a result of factors associated \nwith  implementation  delays.  The  economic  analyses  were  reappraised  for  the  drainage  and \nfloodway, and wastewater components.  \n \nB. \n\nMethodology \n\nThe economic analyses were conducted over 30 years, including the investment period. \n5. \nAll  economic  costs  exclude  taxes  and  duties  and  are  expressed  using  a  domestic  price \nnumeraire. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.05 was calculated based on the value of imports \nand  exports,  and  related  taxes  during  2005\u20132006.  It  is  applied  to  all  tradable  goods.  Foreign \nand  domestic  skilled  labor  is  treated  as  tradable  goods  due  to  the  ease  and  frequency  with \nwhich Samoans obtain work in the international labor market. The estimated cost overrun for the \ndrainage  component  is  ST2.39  million  and  for  the  wastewater  component  ST11.10  million \n($4.44  million).  Cost  increases  associated  with  consulting  services  of  ST1.20  million  ($0.48 \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Country Environmental Analysis: Samoa.

Physical contingencies are included in \nall cost estimates. \n \n\n1. \n\nDrainage and Floodway Component  \n\n \n6. \nThe  drainage  and  floodway  component  will  mitigate  flooding  of  the  Gasegase  River, \nAsaga Stream Bypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the central business area \nin  Apia;  and  provides  data  required  for  developing  a  broader  drainage  management  plan  to \nguide  future  improvements.  The  investment  will  rehabilitate  the  Fugalei  River,  Gasegase \nStream,  and  Asaga  Stream  bypass  channels  through  the  removal  of  debris  and  silt.  Flow-\ngauging stations will be installed to monitor stream flow, and provide data for hydraulic modeling \nand  further  drainage  design.  The  investment  cost  for  this  component  is  estimated  at  ST10.94 \nmillion  ($4.38  million),  or  ST4.97  million  ($3.58  million)  at  economic  prices.  Operation  and \nmaintenance costs are assumed to be 2% of the total investment cost. \n \n7. \nIn the absence of investments in a drainage and floodway system, current conditions of \nflooding would continue. The benefits of the drainage system are evaluated in terms of avoided \neconomic costs associated with damage to structures, infrastructure, and goods in central Apia \nthat would continue to be incurred as a result of flooding. The avoided costs are derived from \ndata presented in two recent studies on the damage of flooding in Apia prepared by the South \nPacific Applied Geoscience Commission.  \n \nThe  first  study3 relied  on  insurance  records  and  personal  interviews  with  recent  flood \n8. \nvictims to assess overall damage incurred by the April 2001 flood. About 1,300 buildings were \naffected,  with  total  financial  losses  of  ST11.1  million.4 The  second  study5 focused  only  on  the \nLower  Vaisigano  catchment  area  of  Apia,  but  provides  more  details  on  flood  damage  in  that \nzone. The study utilizes the flood stage damage curve to estimate total direct damage costs to \nhousehold, commercial, health, and social establishments, as well as public infrastructure over \na broad range of possible flood events.6 \n \n9. \nThe calculation of benefits for the drainage component combines the damage data from \nthe  2001  study  with  damage  data  and  flood  stage  damage  curves  from  the  2008  study \nextrapolated to the project area.7 The damage costs (in financial terms) estimated for each flood \nevent (footnote 6) are shown in Figure A7. These costs are annualized based on probability of \nthe  event  occurring  in  a  given  year.  Damage  costs  are  based  on  annual  costs  of  severe  and \nserious  flooding  events.  Damage  associated  with  frequent  minor  flooding  events  (1:1  year  or \nmore  often)  are  excluded  from  the  benefit  calculation.  The  average  annual  damage  costs  are \nestimated  at  ST2.33  million  ($0.93  million).  The  average  annual  damage  avoided  by  the \ndrainage component is conservatively estimated by assuming that only half the damage costs \nassociated  with  the  1:20  year  event  and  above  would  be  mitigated.  The  full  damage  costs \nassociated  with  the  1:5  year  and  1:2  year  events  are  assumed  to  be  fully  mitigated  by  the \ninvestment.  The total avoided damage cost is estimated at ST1.99 million ($0.76 million). The \n\n                                                 \n3   Yeo, Stephen. 2001. A Review of Flooding in Apia, Samoa.

Damage  data  from  the  2008  study  was \nextrapolated  to  the  project  area  for  the  remaining  events  using  the  same  ratio  (2.88)  between  the  local  damage \ncosts reported in the 2008 study and overall damage recorded in the 2001 study.  \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\navoided  costs  are  converted  into  economic  costs  by  excluding  taxes  and  duties  and  applying \nthe calculated shadow exchange rate factor to tradable goods. \n\nFigure A7: Damage Cost by Flood Recurrence Interval \n\n18,000\n\n16,000\n\n14,000\n\n12,000\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n(\n \n\n0)\n0\n0\nT'\nS\nst\no\nC\ne \ng\nma\na\nD\n\n-\n\n1:\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nRecurrence Inteval (1:X Years)\n\n1:20\n\n1:40\n\n1:60\n\n1:80\n\n1:100\n\n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe  health  and  other  benefits  associated  with  improved  standards  of  living  and \n10. \ncommercial activities resulting from a cleaner environment were not quantified for the economic \nanalysis.  While  the  health  benefits,  including  reduced  incidences  of  typhoid,  infant  diarrhea, \ndengue,  and  leptospirosis;  and  environmental  benefits  are  significant  and  identified  as  key \nimpacts  of  the  drainage  component,  they  are  difficult  to  quantify  and  assign  specifically  to \nimproved drainage.     \n\n \n2. \n\nWastewater Management and Sanitation Component \n\n \n11. \nThe  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  component  will  complement  the  drainage \ncomponent  by  providing  (i)  a  centralized  operating  sewerage  system  servicing  approximately \n150  commercial  and  government  premises  in  the  central  business  district  in  Apia,  and  (ii)  a \ndecentralized septic tank maintenance and replacement program.  \n \n12.  Most septic tanks within the Apia area currently do not meet the construction standards \nrequired under the National Building Code and do not treat sewage adequately. Septage from \nthe majority of septic tanks discharge directly to water courses or to aquifers creating a public \nhealth  hazard  and  causing  environmental  degradation.  The  discharge  of  septage  to  public \ndrains is a prohibited activity as noted under Section 3(d) of the Public Drains Regulations 2006 \nand  contravenes  Section  63(d)  of  the  Planning  and  Urban  Management  Act  2003.  The  septic \ntank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  will  provide  services  to  premises  for  which \nconnection  to  the  centralized  sewerage  system  is  not  economically  viable.  The  program  will \ninitially  service  about  500  customers  and  be  expanded  over  time  through  a  revolving  fund  to \nservice approximately 8,000 customers.  \n \n13. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  centralized  sewerage  system  compares  the  with-project \ninvestment scenario to an alternative on-site individual investment scenario. Both scenarios are \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7  \n\n39 \n\nassumed  to  provide  similar  environmental  and  health  benefits.8 The  investment  costs  of  the \nwith-project  scenario  are  estimated  at  ST31.19  million  ($12.48  million)  in  financial  terms  and \nST25.45  million  ($10.19  million)  in  economic  terms.  The  total  annual  economic  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  are  derived  from  the  financial  model  for  the  wastewater  treatment \nplant and the pressure sewer system, and include management costs (Appendix 8).  \n \n14. \nThe  alternative  to  the  sewerage  system  is  assumed  to  be  a  continuation  of  on-site \ntreatment  systems.  The  alternative  assumes  two  types  of  individual  systems  depending  on \nwater  demand  and  associated  volume  of  wastewater  generated  by  three  customer  groups \ncategorized  by  size.  Small-use  customers,  defined  as  those  that  could  be  served  by  a  single \nseptic  tank,  would  be  serviced  by  a  septic  tank  with  an  investment  cost  of  ST12,500  and  an \nannual  maintenance  cost  of  ST500.  These  septic  tanks  require  six  pump-outs  per  year. 9 \nMedium-and large-use customers will require small package plants with an investment cost of \nST300,000 and annual O&M costs of ST34,000, inclusive of pump-outs. The investment costs \nand O&M costs are scaled for the estimated volume of wastewater (Table A7.1). \n \n\nTable A7.1: Estimated Costs and Capacity of Individual Sewerage Systems \n\nVolume of Wastewater a \n\nm3/User/day \n\n  Per m3/day b\n\nTotal \n\n  Per m3/day b \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nm3/day \n634 \n240 \n125 \n1,000 \n\n \n\nCapital Cost \n(ST\u2018000) \n\n31.2 \n31.2 \n9.6 \n28.5 \n\n19,777 \n7,494 \n1,200 \n28,471 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nAnnual O&M \n(ST\u2018000) \n\n2.45 \n2.45 \n1.53 \n2.33 \n\n1,553 \n588 \n192 \n2,333 \n\nCustomer \n\nLargec \nMediumd \nSmall e \nTotal \n\n90.6 \n8.6 \n1.3 \n7.6 \n\nm3 = cubic meter, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na Recorded total water demand scaled to wastewater treatment plant capacity of 1,000 m3 per day. \nb Cost per m3 daily wastewater volume. \nc Seven largest customers. \nd Require more than one septic tank except for the seven largest customers. \ne Require one septic tank. \nSources: Samoa Water Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Results and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n15. \nAll costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2008 prices and are discounted by an \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  economic  analyses  yield  internal  economic \nrates of returns of 13.2% for the drainage and floodway component (Table A7.2) and 16.5% for \nthe  sewerage  system  (Table  A7.3).  The  results  are  robust  with  respect  to  changes  in  key \nassumptions  and  risks,  although  the  analysis  shows  that  combined  adverse  events  will  cause \nthe  internal  economic  rates  of  return  to  fall  below  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital \n(Tables  A7.4  and  A7.5).  Risk  of  further  delays  and  cost  increases  is  negligible  as \nimplementation is advanced. Sustainability throughout the life of the Project is ensured through \nthe funding mechanism for O&M of the wastewater component. \n \n\n                                                 \n8   Since environmental and heath benefits are assumed to be identical under both investment scenarios, they cancel \n\nout. However, this assumption may not apply in practice. \n\n9   Pump-out frequency is based on survey data of project beneficiaries provided by the Samoa Water Authority. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7

These  estimates  were  prepared  on  the  basis  of  agreements  reached \nbetween  the  Government  of  Samoa,  Samoa  Water  Authority  (SWA),  and  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  establish  mechanisms  to  ensure  appropriate  cost  recovery  for  these  project \ncomponents. \n \n2. \nDirect  cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  the  application  of  a \ntariff  for  those  connected  to  the  sewerage  system,  and  (ii)  an  environmental  charge  for  those \nserved  by  the  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program.  SWA\u2019s  responsibilities  for \nmanaging the operations of both project components will include the billing and collection of the \nwastewater  tariff  and  environmental  charge.  To  ensure  that  these  charges  continue  to  be \nsufficient  to  achieve  the  agreed  cost-recovery  objectives,  SWA  will  prepare  annual  reviews  of \nthe charges and submit them for Cabinet consideration.  \n \nA. \n\nSewerage System  \n\nThe sewerage system will provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage \n3. \ngenerated  in  Apia\u2019s  central  business  area,  as  well  as  several  priority  special  needs  areas, \nincluding  the  National  Hospital,  Malifa  School,  and  Fugalei  Market.  The  system  will  provide \naverage  treatment  capacity  of  1,000 cubic  meters  (m3)/day  and  serve  approximately  150 \nbusiness and government premises. \n \n4. \nCost  Recovery.  Direct  cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries  will  be  achieved  through  the \napplication of a wastewater tariff for those connected to the sewerage system. The tariff will be \nset on the basis of metered water consumption and applied by SWA as a separate line item on \ncustomers\u2019 water bills. At a minimum, the wastewater tariff will be sufficient to cover the cost of \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  management.  The  Government  will  fund  any  gap \nbetween  actual  tariffs  and  the  amount  required  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  as  a  community \nservice obligation (CSO). CSOs are Government-mandated services provided by public utilities \nintended to achieve broader economic, environmental, and social objectives. Given these wider \nobjectives, the ability to fully recover costs from user charges is generally limited, at least over \nthe  shorter  term.  In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2007,  SWA  received  just  under  ST3  million  from  the \nGovernment for CSOs relating to its existing water supply operations. \n \n5. \nKey  Assumptions.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  sewerage  system  to \nestimate  tariff  and  CSO  funding  requirements.  The  key  assumptions  underlying  these \nprojections are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\nProject life. The project component will commence operations in FY2010 with an \neconomic useful life of 30 years.  \n\n(ii)  Wastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  O&M  costs.  These  are  estimated  for \neach year over the project life by individual cost item: labor, electricity, chemicals, \nsludge  transport  and  disposal,  spare  parts,  and  other  maintenance.  In  FY2010, \nthe  cost  of  WWTP  O&M  is  estimated  at  ST930,000,  expressed  in  constant \nFY2008  prices.  Over  the  life  of  the  facility,  a  gradual  increase  in  costs  is \nprojected due to greater maintenance requirements. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(iii) \n\nPressure  sewer  O&M  costs.  Estimated  for  each  year  by  individual  cost  item: \nlabor,  electricity,  pump  maintenance,  and  sewer  maintenance.  The  cost  of \nelectricity required for the operation of the pumps will be borne directly by each \npremise  served  by  the  system.  Therefore,  this  cost  is  excluded  from  SWA\u2019s \noperating  costs  for  the  purposes  of  tariff  calculation.  Total  O&M  costs  borne  by \nSWA  in  FY2010  are  estimated  at  ST95,000  in  constant  prices.  For  the  WWTP, \nmaintenance costs will gradually increase over the project life.  \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Management  costs.  Based  on  estimates  presented  in  SWA\u2019s  draft  business \nplan for its Wastewater Management Division\u2014which will be responsible for both \nthe sewerage system, and septic tank maintenance and replacement program\u2014\njust  over  half  the  estimated  total  annual  management  cost,  equivalent  to  about \nST160,000 in constant 2008 prices, is allocated to the wastewater system.  \nCapital  replacement  costs.  The  major  requirement  is  replacement  of  the \npressure sewer pumps, which have an estimated life of 20 years. Based on this, \nan annual provision is made equivalent to 5% of the total pump replacement cost. \nDebt  service. Debt service includes principal and interest, and is based on the \nterms of the subsidiary loan agreement between SWA and the Government. The \nterm of the loan is 32 years, including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate \nof 5%. \nFull  cost  recovery.  Consistent  with  existing  project  legal  agreements,  full  cost \nrecovery  is  defined  as  the  coverage  of  O&M  and  management  costs;  debt \nservice; and a rate of return agreed to between SWA and the Ministry of Finance. \nGiven  that  the  rate  of  return  has  yet  to  be  agreed,  this  is  assumed  to  be  a  3% \nannual return on revalued fixed assets.   \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(viii)  Wastewater  tariff. The tariff requirements are estimated for each year over the \nuseful  life  of  the  project  based  on  three  alternative  cost-recovery  objectives:  \n(a)  cover  O&M  and  management  expenses;  (b)  cover  O&M  and  management \nexpenses  plus  debt  service;  and  (c)  achieve  full  cost  recovery.  The  collection \nrate\u2014the  proportion  of  tariff  revenues  billed  that  SWA  actually  collects\u2014is \nassumed to be 90% initially with gradual improvement to 95% over the life of the \nProject. \nCSO  funding.  The  Government  provides  the  difference  between  the  cost \nrecovery  achieved  by  tariffs  and  that  required  for  full  cost  recovery  to  SWA \nthrough CSO funding. \nPrice  basis. Costs and revenues are converted from constant to current prices \non  the  basis  of  the  projected  domestic  inflation  rate,  which  is  3.6%  per  year \nduring  FY2008\u2013FY2011,  and  is  assumed  to  then  gradually  decline  to  3.2%  by \nFY2015. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n6. \nWastewater  Tariffs  and  Government  Funding.

With  the \nintroduction of a centralized sewerage system, existing on-site sanitation systems installed and \noperated by individual premises will no longer be required. Therefore, the net cost to consumers \nis  the  cost  of  the  centralized  sewerage  system  less  the  cost  savings  associated  with  the \nelimination of these on-site systems.  \n \n8. \nThe  total  monthly  charges  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  current  water  consumption, \nwhich  is  excessive  due  to  low  water  tariffs.  Water  tariffs  presently  cover  only  about  40%  of \nSWA\u2019s O&M expenses, and therefore need to be increased. With technical assistance from the \nEuropean Union, SWA is presently reviewing its water tariffs and will propose an increase to the \nGovernment in late 2008. The combination of higher water tariffs and the new wastewater tariff \nwill  result  in  much  more  efficient  use  of  water.  Therefore,  with  less  water  consumed,  the \nfinancial impact of the wastewater charges will be reduced.    \n \n\nTable A8.2: Sewerage System \nEstimated Total Monthly Wastewater Charges in FY2010 \n(ST) \n\nDaily Water Consumed \n\n1.

The program will provide for regular septic tank pump-outs on \na 2-year cycle, and maintenance and replacement on a 20-year cycle, servicing approximately \n8,000  premises  in  greater  Apia.  SWA  will  manage  the  program,  but  outsource  its  O&M  to  the \nprivate sector.   \n \n10. \nThe  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  will  fund  the  immediate \nreplacement  of  up  to  500  septic  tanks  servicing  residential  lots  in  Apia\u2019s  low-lying  areas.  This \ninitial  capital  injection  will  provide  the  basis  establishing  a  revolving  fund  for  the  septic  tank \nreplacement  component  of  the  program.  The  revolving  fund  will  eventually  finance  the \ninstallation of new tanks in approximately 8,000 premises in greater Apia over 20 years.  \n \n11. \nUser  Charges.  Beyond the initial capital injection from the Project, the program will be \nfunded by an environmental charge, to be levied on all 8,000 premises receiving services under \nthe program. The environmental charge will be set on the basis of metered water consumption \nor  alternatively  as  a  fixed  amount.  This  charge  will  be  included  on  the  SWA  water  bill  as  a \nseparate line item. \n \n12. \nCost  Recovery.  At a minimum, the environmental charge will be set to cover the costs \nof O&M and management of the program. If the charges are not adequate to also cover annual \ncapital  expenditures  for  septic  tank  replacement,  this  cost  will  be  funded  by  the  Government. \nCharges are estimated under two alternative cost-recovery objectives: (i) coverage of O&M and \nmanagement costs; and (ii) coverage of O&M and management costs, as well as annual capital \nexpenditure requirements. \n \n13. \nkey assumptions: \n \n\nKey  Assumptions.  Environmental charges are estimated on the basis of the following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProgram  life.  The  program  life  is  assumed  to  be  20  years.  During  this  period, \nseptic tanks serving all 8,000 premises in the greater Apia area will be replaced \nunder the program. \nAnnual  capital  investments. Each year, 400 septic tanks will be replaced at a \nunit cost of ST2,500, expressed in constant 2008 prices. \nO&M  costs.  Each  septic  tank  is  pumped  out  every  2  years  at  a  cost  of  ST250 \nper  pump-out.  The  annual  cost  of  minor  maintenance  is  ST50  per  septic  tank, \nexpressed on a constant price basis.   \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Management  costs.  Annual  SWA  management  costs  are  estimated  at \nST150,000.  The  private  sector  contractors  retained  by  SWA  to  implement  the \nprogram will also incur estimated management of costs of ST400,000 per year. \nEnvironmental  charge.  Charges  are  estimated  as  a  fixed  monthly  fee.  The \ncollection  rate,  the  proportion  of  charges  billed  actually  collected  by  SWA,  is \nassumed to be 90%. \nPrice  basis. Costs and revenues are converted from constant to current prices \non the basis of the projected domestic inflation rate. \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8  \n\n47 \n\nEnvironmental Charges and Government Funding.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008\u20132010 (SDS) identifies the provisions of efficient and effective utility service \nand  infrastructure  as  essential  elements  for  economic  growth,  and  specifically  identifies  the  Project  to  help  meet  key \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Samoa,  as  articulated  in  the  draft  country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132012), is aligned with the SDS 2008\u20132012 and supports the achievement of SDS goals through \ntwo  pillars  for  intervention:  (i)  improved  delivery  of  public  services,  including  the  removal  of  infrastructure  constraints;  and \n(ii)  promotion  of  private  sector  development.  Priority  sectors  identified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  are  (i)  energy; \n(ii) water supply, sanitation, and waste management; and (iii) education. The priority themes are private sector development \nand sustainable economic growth. ADB assistance to the water sector in Samoa focuses on drainage and sanitation. \n \nSamoa\u2019s  national  vision  is  \u201censuring  sustainable  economic  and  social  progress.\u201d  Samoa  has  made  significant  progress \nover  the  past  decade.  Economic  performance  has  achieved  positive  results,  and  social  indicators  have  shown  promising \nimprovements. Despite this, inequalities may be increasing for selected groups and significant challenges remain. Strategies \nto  reduce  hardship  and  increase  opportunities  cannot  ignore  the  people\u2019s  vital  requirements  for  water,  and  the  need  for \nequitable  and  sustainable  management  of  this  critical  resource  in  the  interests  of  society  as  a  whole.  Access  to  public \nservices, quality of service  delivery, and lack of income-generating opportunities have all been identified as major issues in \nrecent assessments of hardship and poverty in Samoa. The role of water is undeniable in reducing such constraints. \n \nSocial  surveys  and  analysis  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  implementation  show  that  some  of  the  poorest \nhouseholds in Apia are located in flood-prone and environmentally degraded low-lying areas. The Project includes elements \nthat specifically address flooding of the low-lying areas of Apia, and will contribute to improved environmental quality through \nimproved  wastewater management and sanitation. The poor will benefit from improved living conditions and reduced health \nrisks. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  \n \nSome  of  the  poorest  households  are  located  in  marginal  flood-prone  and  water-logged  areas  of  Apia;  their  homes  are \nfrequently  subject  to  flooding  causing  damage  to  structures;  loss  of  belongings;  limited  or  loss  of  access  to  work  places, \nservices, and facilities; and increased risk of waterborne disease. The poorest households cannot afford improved sanitation \nfacilities,  resulting  in  increased  health  risks,  environmental  degradation,  and  loss  of  amenities.  The  Project  directly  benefits \nthe  poorest  households  in  Apia,  particularly  those  living  in  low-lying  areas  by  providing  flood  mitigation  measures  and \nimproved and well-maintained sanitation facilities (up to 500 households will be provided with septic tanks). The poor will also \nbenefit from environmental improvements resulting from improved wastewater management services. \n \n2.   Design Features  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit poverty reduction through the provision of some limited jobs for unskilled laborers during the \nconstruction phase and for ongoing drainage maintenance. Poverty reduction impacts can be expected from economic growth \nas  a  result  of  improvements  to  central  business  area  infrastructure,  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  utility \nfacilities, and improved marine environment for the fisheries industry. \n\n Key Issues  \n\n \n\nC.

Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty  data  and  information  through  a  community  consultation  process  contributed  to  the  project  design.  Poverty  analysis \nwas  considered  in  relation  to  the  cost-recovery  and  user-pay  features  of  the  wastewater  and  sanitation  infrastructure \ncomponents. \n \nThe proportion of the poor in the service area population cannot be quantified meaningfully as Samoa has no official poverty \nline.  Some  of  the  poorest  households  in  Apia  are  in  the  low-lying  area  identified  in  the  project  design  for  sanitation  facility \nrehabilitation.  Many  Apia  residents  are  urban  migrants  who  live  outside  the  traditional  village  structure  and  are  exposed  to \ngreater social and economic risks because they have no or limited access to traditional social protection mechanisms. These \npoor households  will benefit  from improved  living conditions and reduction in health risks. The greater Apia area is likely to \ninclude some poor households that will share the same benefits, but with greater marginal utility. Urban poor relying on local \nfishing  for  consumption  and  income  will  benefit  from  the  improved  marine  environment.  Cleaner  marine  water  will  benefit \nthose using it for recreation. \n \nBecause  this  is  an  environmental  project,  the  living  conditions  for  all  in  the  service  area  of  the  Project  will  improve.  These \nbenefits  will  also  accrue  to  the  poor.  Improved  environmental  quality  will  promote  sustainable  urban  development,  for \nexample,  through  tourism.  The  improvement  in  water  quality  will  contribute  to  the  steady  development  of  a  water-based \ntourism industry that depends directly on good water quality. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n \nConsultation  with  key  stakeholders  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  has  continued  throughout  the \nimplementation of the project through public meetings, workshops, and media campaigns. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThe Project includes a community education and public awareness program being implemented by the project implementation \nconsults. The program commenced in January 2008 and will continue for the duration of the Project. Key features include \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nregular press releases including publication of monthly project feature articles, media interviews, and radio \ntalk shows; \nthe  \u201cfriendly  neighborhood\u201d  campaign  involving  discussions  and  dissemination  of  project  information  to \nhouseholds within the project area; \ncommunity-wide distribution of a project information pamphlet in the Samoan language; and \nradio and TV advertisement. \n\n \nActivities to date include \n(i) \n\ndevelopment and dissemination of project information pamphlets in the Samoan language; the pamphlets \nwere distributed in the \u201cfriendly neighborhood\u201d\u2014door-to-door information campaign; \npublication of feature articles on the Project in the national newspapers; \nproduction of a sanitation and drainage brochure to be distributed to the public; \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  meetings with various stakeholders who could possibly contribute and assist with the awareness activities \n\n(v) \n\nof the Project; \ndevelopment  of  the  \u201ccommunity  fact  file\u201d  (a  quarter-page  advertisement)  published  in  local  newspapers \nonce a week informing the general public and residents of the project sites of project issues and progress \nbefore, during, and after construction; and \n\n(vi)  monitoring of information released to the community through the media and other sources. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nC.
