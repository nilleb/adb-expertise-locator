The  Project  will  organize\nfarmers  to  operate  and  maintain  irrigation  systems,  and  assist\nhouseholds to obtain land title.\n\nPrimary: economic\nSecondary: poverty reduction\n\nCategory  -   B\nAn initial environmental examination  (IEE)  was undertaken,  and\nis summarized in an appendix.\n\nThe  Government  places  a  high  priority  on  poverty  reduction\nthrough  growth  of  the  rural  economy.  The  Asian  Development\nBank's  (ADB)  strategy  in  Cambodia  supports  this  objective  by\nfocusing  investments  in  the  populous  rural  areas  of  the  plains\nand  Tonle  Sap  region,  where  the  majority  of  the  poor  reside.\nAgriculture, the  mainstay  of  the  rural  economy,  is  hampered  by\nlack  of  irrigation,  poor  roads  and  market  facilities,  and  limited\naccess  to  improved  farming  technology.  The  project  area  in\nKompong  Thom  Province  is  dominated  by  rural  subsistence  or\nsemisubsistence  farming  dependent  on  one  low-yield  rain-fed\nrice  crop  per  year.  The  majority  of  households  live  below  the\nCambodian poverty line. Periodic droughts in the wet season, or\nsevere flooding, force families into debt to meet their subsistence\nfood  needs.  For  lack  of  irrigation,  most  lands  lie  barren  and\nfallow in the dry season.\n\nThe  provision  of  irrigation  and  drainage,  agriculture  extension,\nrural  roads,  and  markets  can  have  an  important  impact  on\nagricultural productivity  and poverty.  In  the  wet  season,  reliable\nflows and drainage will ensure crop survival during droughts and\nfloods, and reduce the risk of investing in inputs. Combined  with\nthe  introduction  of  modern  rice  varieties,  supplemental  wet\nseason  irrigation  will  also  permit  double  cropping.  Dry  season\nirrigation  will  permit  the  adoption of high-yield  rice  varieties  and\ndiversification  into  higher  value  cash  crops.  Improved  roads\nreduce  vehicle  and  harvesting  costs,  permit  greater  and  timely\nuse of inputs, and generate  other  economic  activities.  Improved\nmarkets reduce spoilage and transaction costs. Combined, such\ninvestments will stimulate the rural economy and reduce poverty.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Project are to increase agricultural\nproductivity  and  farmers\u2019 \nthe  rural\neconomy by providing irrigation and drainage for 7,000 hectares\n(ha),  and  improving  rural  roads  and  markets  in  and  around  the\n\nincome,  and  stimulate \n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiii\n\nproject area. To achieve these objectives, water user groups will\nbe  formed  and  trained  to  operate  and  maintain  the  irrigation\nscheme,  cost  recovery  measures  will  be  applied  for  roads  and\nirrigation  works,  government  staff  at  the  central  and  provincial\nlevel will be strengthened, and benefit monitoring and evaluation\nwill  be  introduced.  The  Project  will also assist farmers to obtain\nlegal title to their lands.\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $23.8  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  $9.6  million  (40  percent)  in  foreign  exchange  and\napproximately  $14.2  million  equivalent  (60  percent)  in  local\ncurrency costs.\n\nSource\n\n Foreign          Local                  Total\nExchange     Currency       Cost     Percent\n\n($ million)\n\nADB\nAFD\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n\n8.6\n1.0\n-\n-\n\n9.6\n\n7.4\n1.6\n4.8\n0.4\n\n16.0\n2.6\n4.8\n0.4\n\n67\n11\n20\n2\n\nTotal\n\n14.2\n\n23.8\n\n100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR12,183,000  from\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.

At the request of the Government, ADB\nfinanced  technical assistance  (TA)  in  1997 to  assess  the  feasibility  of  rehabilitating  the  Stung\nChinit  irrigation  system  in Kompong  Thom  Province.2  The  consultants  focused  their  efforts  on\nthe full development of the system, including an upstream dam and storage to provide wet and\ndry  season  irrigation  over  12,000  hectares  (ha).  Concerned  about  the  Government\u2019s\nimplementation capacity and the environmental impacts of the dam, ADB requested analysis of\na limited development option that would rehabilitate the existing system and use run-of-the-river\nflows to provide supplemental wet season irrigation for 12,000 ha and dry season irrigation for\n2,000 ha.3 Because the study was truncated due to deteriorating security and political turmoil in\n1997, ADB was unable to make a firm decision on whether to proceed with project processing.\nThe study was able to verify strong support for the Project by local people.\n\n3.\nSubsequently the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) requested\nTA to reassess the Project. The TA commenced in November 1999.4 The TA report concluded\nthat  a  limited development option  providing  supplemental  wet  season  irrigation  over  7,000  ha\nand dry season irrigation over 2,000 ha,  and  improving  rural  roads and  markets  in  the  project\narea would be a cost-effective way of increasing agricultural production and farmers' incomes,\nand stimulating the rural economy in the province. A socioeconomic survey of the project area\ncompleted in April 2000 confirmed widespread support for the Project and found that almost 60\npercent of the target beneficiaries live below the national poverty line. ADB and the Government\nagreed to proceed on the basis of the TA recommendations while keeping open the option for\nfuture development of a dam and storage reservoir. This report is based on the findings of the\nfeasibility  studies; external  reports from  the  project  area;  ADB  missions;  and  discussions  with\nGovernment  officials,  project  beneficiaries,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  international\nagencies involved in irrigation and rural roads. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\n\n                                               \n1 \n2\n\nLoan 1199-CAM: Special Rehabilitation Assistance, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\nTA 2592-CAM: Stung Chinit Water Resources Development, for $800,000, approved on 25 June 1996.\nThe Government confirmed at the final tripartite meeting and subsequent meetings that a dam and storage reservoir\nmay be more appropriately considered as a second phase project.\nTA  3275-CAM:  Study for Stung Chinit Water Resources Development Project,  for  $150,000,  approved  on\n13 October 1999.\n\n3\n\n4 \n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nOverview\n\n4.\nCambodia borders Thailand to the west and north, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to\nthe north, and Viet Nam to the east. More than 80 percent of its 11.4 million inhabitants live in\nrural  areas.  One  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  the  region  and  the  world,  Cambodia  is\nmarked by low life expectancy and literacy, and high rates of infant mortality and poverty. The\nmost  recent  (1997)  socioeconomic  data  indicate  that  40  percent  of  the  rural  population  live\nbelow the national poverty line of about $0.41 per person per day.5 Seventy-five percent of rural\npoor  are  from  households  involved  in  some  type  of  agricultural  activity.  Although  peace  has\nbrought a measure of prosperity to the country, there is growing inequality in the distribution of\nincome per capita, with urban areas benefiting from economic growth far more than rural areas.\n\nRural agriculture dominates the Cambodian economy, accounting for nearly half of gross\n5.\ndomestic product (GDP) and 90 percent of employment. Cambodia\u2019s real GDP growth slumped\nfrom an average of over 6 percent in 1991-1996  to only  1  percent following political  turmoil  in\n1997. The agriculture sector averaged less than 3 percent growth prior to 1997, and suffered in\n1997  and  1998  from  floods  and  drought.6  Only  a  fraction  of  cultivated  land  is  irrigated,\nproduction  costs  are  high  due  mostly  to  the  limited  transport  network,  and  agriculture\ntechnologies  lag  far  behind  regional  norms.  For  the  typical  Cambodian  farmer,  unpredictable\nrice surpluses that depend crucially on the weather, plus limited fish and livestock, provide the\nsole source of cash.\n\n2. \n\nThe Impact of War on Agriculture\n\nRice  is  the  staple  food  of  the  country,  is  the  most  commonly  traded  commodity,  and\n6.\naccounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural output and 90 percent of cultivated land. But\nduring the civil war from 1970 to 1975, Cambodia slipped from being a major exporter of rice, to\na net importer, to the brink of starvation.7 The next 15 years of civil strife, population dislocation,\nand neglect left rural infrastructure in shambles, destroyed human resources, and dramatically\nreduced  agricultural  output.  During  the  period  of  Khmer  Rouge  control,  all  city  dwellers  were\nrelocated  to  the  countryside  and  together  with  rural  farmers  organized  into  indentured  labor\ngroups  that  were  repeatedly  moved  to  different  provinces.  All  private  property  was  abolished,\nmen and women were forced to live separately, eating became a communal activity, and daily\nrations set at  one  can of  rice  per  person  per  day.  The  impact on  civil  society  was  profound\u2014\nmore than two decades later rural Cambodia is still marked by lack of social cohesion and low\ninvestment  in  land  improvement  for  agriculture.  Rice  yields  remain  among  the  lowest  in  Asia,\naveraging 1.4-1.6  metric  tons  per  hectare  (t/ha)  in  the  wet  season  and  2.5-3.0  t/ha  in  the  dry\nseason, and many provinces suffer from food insecurity. Apart from rice, some cash crops are\ngrown close to urban centers, but to date there is only modest development of alternative crops\nin rural Cambodia.\n\n                                               \n5\n6 \n\nNational Institute of Statistics. 1997.

To  be  effective,  investments  targeting  agricultural\nproductivity will need to respond to all of these constraints in an integrated manner.\n\n8.\nWater  resource  management  is  an  especially  pressing  challenge  in  Cambodia,  which\nfaces annual floods and droughts, and  sedimentation of  waterways due  to  deforestation.  Until\nrecently,  the  irrigation  subsector  was  marked  by  lack  of  investments.  Only  12  percent  of  rice\nareas currently receive some supplemental irrigation, and dry season rice may be grown on only\n6 percent of the total rice area. Where irrigation systems have been built, maintenance presents\na  problem  due  to  lack  of  resources  for  recurrent  expenditures  and  low  participation  by\nbeneficiaries. Organizing and training farmers for O&M and eventually management of irrigation\nsystems,  and  developing  user  fees  for  cost  recovery  are  thus  crucial  elements  to  ensure  the\nsustainability of future investments in irrigation.\n\nThere is a growing need for the  Government  to develop  a  comprehensive approach to\n9.\nthe  water  sector  with  a  clearly  defined  authority  across  agencies,  modalities  for  stakeholder\nparticipation  in  setting  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  water  users,  and  separation  of  the\nresponsibilities  for  water  resource  management  and  service  delivery.  Appropriate  policies,\nlegislation, and institutional framework should also be defined and established to support these\nreforms,  and  the  concerned  agencies  given  substantial  capacity  development  in  terms  of\nplanning, coordination, and implementation. Systematic and well-defined  investment  strategies\nfor water resource management and service delivery also need to be developed.\n\n10.\nAnother  important  issue  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  the  unregulated  use  of  dangerous\npesticides.  Although  the  Government  passed  a  law  in  1998  to  regulate  the  sale  and  use  of\nchemicals, vaccines, and medicines in agriculture, to date  implementation  and enforcement  of\nthe  law  is  minimal,  and  pesticides  banned  in  other  countries  are  readily  available  in  local\nmarkets.  Farmers typically  are  unaware of  the  dangers to themselves  and  others  from  use  of\nsuch  chemicals,  and  agricultural  runoff  can  distribute  toxins  to  the  Tonle  Sap  and  into  the\nhuman food  chain  through fish  consumption.  Improving  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor\nand enforce the Agricultural Materials Law will require a long-term, nationwide effort, but in the\nshort  term  the  focus  should  be  on  reducing  demand  through  education  on  the  hazards  and\ndemonstration of alternatives.\n\n4.\n\nInstitutions\n\n11.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) has primary responsibility for\nthe  agriculture  sector,  and  is  in  the  process  of  developing  a  pilot  system  for  agricultural\nextension  with  bilateral  assistance.  Prior  to  1999,  MAFF  was  also  responsible  for  water\nresource  management,  particularly  irrigation,  through  its  General  Directorate  of  Irrigation,\nMeteorology  and  Hydrology  (GDIMH).  In  1999  GDIMH  was  separated  and  upgraded  to\nMOWRAM, an independent ministry.  The  third national  institution  relevant  to  agriculture  is  the\nMinistry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD);  its  responsibilities  include  rural  roads.  Each  agency\nmaintains  provincial  departments,  which  serve  as  the  focal  point  for  implementation  of  aid-\nassisted  projects.  Although  all  three  ministries  suffer  from  lack  of  qualified  midlevel\n\n\fprofessionals, the international community, including ADB, is dedicating substantial resources to\ninstitutional strengthening.\n\n4\n\n5.\n\nThe Project Area\n\na.\n\nSocioeconomic Profile\n\n12.\nThe Project is located in the southwestern part of Kompong Thom adjacent to National\nRoad 6, and about 12-15 kilometers (km) east of the flood stage of the Tonle Sap. It is a rural\narea dominated by agriculture. The most recent household-level data  (collected  in  March-April\n2000) indicates that nearly 60 percent of the people in the project area live below the national\npoverty line, compared with the national average of 40 percent for rural areas. Thirty-six percent\nof farmers surveyed borrowed money from local lenders last year to finance medical care  and\nsmall  investments  in  economic  activity,  and  to  cover  food  shortages  at  the  end  of  the  wet\nseason.  The  province  has  the  highest  incidence  of  underweight  children,  and  the  second\nhighest incidence of stunted growth\u2014key measures of malnutrition. Kompong Thom ranks 18th\nout of 21 provinces on the human development index (HDI),8 which combines information on life\nexpectancy at birth, educational attainment, adult literacy, and real GDP per capita. Although it\nis  close  to  Phnom  Penh,  it  lags  behind  other  agricultural  areas  in  infrastructure  and  use  of\nimproved agricultural technologies due to its location on the front lines of internal conflict.\n\nb.\n\nAgriculture\n\n13.\nKompong Thom is a  significant  rice-growing area,  with  128,000  ha  of  paddy and  more\nthan a third of the total floating  rice production nationwide.  But  rice  production  in  the province\nsuffers from floods, droughts, and rat infestations. Drought periods of up to 15 days during the\nwet season can cause severe crop losses, and farmers report dry year yields of less than half\nthose of a wet year. Local varieties make up almost all of rice grown in the province. Although\nthe  Government  has  a  small  agriculture  extension  staff,  it  is  not  adequate  to  fully  meet  the\nneeds of the province or the project area.\n\n14.\nA  social  assessment  of  the  project  area  conducted  in  the  1997  TA  was  updated  in\nMarch-April 2000 through household surveys in 13 villages. The survey found current rice yields\nat 1.2-1.4 t/ha, with a maximum of 2.4 t/ha (using modern varieties) and a minimum of 0.5 t/ha.\nThese  yields  compare  poorly  with  those  attained  in  neighboring  countries  because  of  lack  of\nirrigation  and  agricultural  extension,  use  of  low-yield  rice  varieties  and  technologies,  and\nimpassable farm-to-market roads. Investments in fertilizer are low, and pesticide use is almost\nnonexistent.  A  few  cash  crops\u2014maize,  mung  beans,  soya  beans,  cassava,  and  melons\u2014are\ngrown  in  the  area,  and  irrigated  with  water  traps  and  from  a  few  shallow  hand-dug  wells.\nHouseholds are involved in some nonrice economic activities, including wood collection, fishing,\nanimal  husbandry,  and  services.  Communities  in  the  project  area  are  not  homogeneous.\nVillages  to  the  east,  near  the  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir,  practice  more  dry  season  cropping\ndue to easier river access, and communities at the western extreme of the command area plant\nmore floating rice and practice fishing due to higher water levels in the wet season.\n\nc.\n\nIrrigation\n\n15.\nThe  Stung  Chinit  irrigation  system  was  built  by  40,000-100,000  forced  laborers  during\nthe Khmer Rouge era to provide supplemental wet season and limited dry season irrigation by\n\n                                               \n8  Royal Government of Cambodia. 1997.

The weir gates and control\nand diversion structures are no longer functioning, and some canals are filled with sediment or\nhave  eroded  banks,  leaving  many  areas  unsuitable  for  crops  even  in  the  wet  season  and\nentirely  barren  during  the  dry  season.  But  the  basic  layout  of  the  scheme  is  sound,  the  weir\nsuperstructures  are  intact,  and  many  of  the  canals  require  only  moderate  earthwork.  The\nsituation  presents  an  opportunity  to  restore  irrigation  at  less  cost  than  to  establish  a  new\nsystem.\n\nAt  present  there  are  no  formal  farmer  organizations  to  manage  water  in  the  area,\n16.\nbecause  the  system  is  completely  dysfunctional.  In  the  early  years  of  scheme  operation,  the\nmain canal and gates were controlled by military units, and secondary and tertiary canals were\nmanaged  by  districts,  communes,  and  villages.  There  are  no  written  records  of  these\narrangements. Farmers report high rice yields during this period, but almost all production was\nshipped  to  other  parts  of  the  country.  During  the  1980s,  scheme  management  apparently\nfaltered, and on several consecutive years downstream villages lost their floating rice crop when\nupstream villagers opened canal gates just before harvest time. This highlights the importance\nof coordinated, participatory system management, and full representation of all communities in\nany irrigation management authority.\n\nd.\n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n17.\nRural  roads  in  the  area  are  generally  impassable  through  the  wet  season,  well  into\nDecember,  except  by  oxcart.  But  with  rights-of-way  well  established  and  a  major,  recently\nrehabilitated  highway  nearby,  these  roads  present  an  opportunity  to  rapidly  improve  living\nconditions  in  adjacent  villages  and  reduce  transport  costs  with  a  moderate  investment  in\nrehabilitation.  The  major  towns  neighboring  the  project  area  lack  adequate  market  facilities\nbeyond patches of cleared  land  with, at best, temporary plastic  roofing.  This  is  typical of  rural\nCambodia\u2014the  1999  Cambodia  Human  Development  Report  notes  that  only  14  percent  of\nvillages  in  the  country  have  a  permanent  market,  and  only  4  percent  have  access  to  an\nagricultural  extension  worker.9  All  these  circumstances  constrain  agricultural  productivity  and\nfarmers' incomes.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n18.\nThe Government\u2019s First Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 1996-\n2000  and  Strategic  Plan  for  1997-2001  lay  a  foundation  for  poverty  reduction  and  economic\nrecovery focused on  rural  development.  Key  SEDP  strategies  that  are  directly  relevant  to  the\nProject  include  (i)  the  achievement  of  poverty  reduction  and  broad  participation  in  the\ndevelopment process by focusing on  rural development;  (ii)  substantial  investment to upgrade\nphysical  infrastructure,  particularly  rural  roads;  (iii)  development  of  the  productive  base  of  the\nrural  economy  by  raising  rice  yields  for  food  security  and  eventually  for  export;  and  (iv)\nenhanced income opportunities for farm households by diversifying crops.10\n\n                                               \n9  Ministry of Planning. 1999.

Phnom\n\nPenh.\n\n\f6\n\n1.\n\nAgriculture and Water Resources\n\n19.\nMajor  policy  issues  in  agriculture  and  water  resources  are  addressed  under  the\nAgriculture  Sector  Program  (ASP),11  which  is  based  on  the  Sector  Development  Policy\nStatement of MAFF, and reflected in the 1996-2000 SEDP. The policy reforms under the ASP\nsupport  the  objectives  of  this  plan  and  focus  specifically  on  (i)  improving  property  rights  by\npreparing  a  new  land  law;  (ii)  liberalizing  fertilizer  pricing  and  marketing;  (iii) increasing\ndissemination of agricultural marketing and technological information; (iv) formulating a strategy\nfor microfinance; (v) defining an institutional framework for sustainable O&M of water resource\ninfrastructure;  (vi)  decentralizing  rural  development  activities  by  establishing  local  rural\ndevelopment committees; and (vii) facilitating divestment of the rubber subsector. In July 2000\nthe  Government  submitted  the  new  land  law  to  the  National  Assembly,  fulfilling  the  final\ncondition for release of the second tranche of ASP funds.\n\n20.\nThe Government also recognizes the need for integrated water resources management\nbased on river basins, with appropriate stakeholder participation and coordination. Improvement\nin water resource management through physical investment as well as policy development, and\ninstitution  building  are  essential  elements  of  the  strategy  to  boost  agricultural  productivity.  An\ninitial effort is under way to codify water resources management with the drafting in early 2000\nof a water law, which is undergoing preliminary discussion by Government agencies. In January\n1999,  the  Government  issued  the  Circular  on  the  Implementation  Policy  for  Sustainable\nIrrigation System, which outlines the institutional arrangements and procedures to progressively\ntransfer  O&M  responsibilities for  irrigation  systems from  the Government to farmer  water user\ngroups.  The  policy  is  being  implemented  on  a  pilot  basis  in  at  least  four  aid-funded  irrigation\nprojects. On the trade and marketing side, the Government has lifted a ban on rice exports and\nliberalized the market for fertilizer.\n\n2. \n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n21.\nIn  December  1999,  MRD  issued  the  Policy for  Rural  Roads.  The  policy  sets  a  goal  of\ndecentralized responsibility for  road  management  to the  province,  communes,  and  villages  on\nthe principle of users and beneficiaries pay, while MRD will provide advice on maintenance and\nlocal  mobilization  of  resources.  This  policy  has  yet  to  be  tested  in  practice,  but  lays  a  good\nfoundation  for  sustainable  development  of  rural  infrastructure.  MRD  has  also  adopted  labor-\nbased  appropriate  technology  (LBAT)  for  rural  road  construction,  in  accordance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policies  on  employment  creation  and  poverty  reduction,  and  with  emphasis  on\ncreating  opportunities  (and  where  appropriate,  establishing  preferences)  for  participation  by\ndisadvantaged groups. MRD is in the process of delegating engineering, supervision, and  civil\nworks  requiring  substantial  equipment  to  the  private  sector,  and  currently  is  training  local\ncontractors to meet its requirements.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n22.\nFrom 1992 to 1999, ADB provided Cambodia with 12 loans, totaling $286 million, and 65\nTA  projects  amounting  to  about  $42.4  million.  Three  of  the  investment  projects  and  nine  TA\nprojects,  totaling  $65.1  million  and  $7.8  million,  respectively,  are  in  the  agriculture  and  rural\ndevelopment  sectors.  Key  investments  in  agriculture,  rural  development,  and  irrigation  are\ndescribed  here,  and  a  complete  list  of  external  assistance  to  these  sectors  is  presented  in\nAppendix 2.\n\n                                               \n11  Loan 1445-CAM:  Agriculture Sector Program, for $30,000,000, approved on 20 June 1996.\n\n\f7\n\n23.\nExternal  assistance  to  the  water  resources  sector,  especially  for  irrigation,  is  small\nrelative  to  other  infrastructure  investments,  and  relatively  new  to  the  country  despite  the  high\npriority  given  by  the  Government.  Recently  the  Government  asked  ADB  to  help  develop  the\noverall  policies,  strategies,  and  programs  for  the  water  sector.  In  1999  ADB  provided  TA  to\nMOWRAM  to  strengthen  its  operational  capacity  for  planning  and  implementing  investment\nprojects, and  to  develop  the necessary  policies and  institutions for  integrated  water  resources\nmanagement.12\n\n24.\nThe World  Bank  provided a  $20  million  loan  to  support  the  development  of  the  Social\nFund under the Government\u2019s Council of Ministers. The Social Fund financed more than 1,400\nsubprojects for water supply, education, health, and village-level infrastructure facilities including\nsmall-scale irrigation in all 24 provinces. A follow-up loan of $25 million was approved in 1999.\nThe World Bank will also provide institutional strengthening and support rehabilitation of small-\nand medium-scale irrigation systems through MOWRAM as part of its $27.5 million Agriculture\nProductivity Improvement Project, which commenced in 2000.\n\n25.\nSeveral assistance  agencies are  implementing farmer-managed  irrigation  systems  with\nvarious  types  of  cost  recovery  measures  for  O&M.  The  European  Union  (EU)  provided  grant\nfunds to rehabilitate small- and medium-scale irrigation systems in six provinces as part of a $44\nmillion Support Program for the Agriculture Sector from 1994 to 1998. Water user groups have\nbeen established to operate and maintain these systems, collect user fees, and conduct various\nincome-generating  activities.  A  $40  million  second  phase  project  commenced  at  the  end  of\n1999.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  has  provided  grant  funds  since  1996  to\nrehabilitate coastal polders and organize beneficiary groups to fund and conduct O&M activities.\nThe  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO),  through  its  Programme  on  Food  Security,  is\ndeveloping seven small-scale irrigation pilot projects with farmer organizations and farmer field\nschools.\n\n26.\nThe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  is  providing  technical  support  to\nMOWRAM and a $10 million grant for the rehabilitation of irrigation canals  in  Kandal Province\nfrom 1999 to 2001. JICA is also planning a five-year project for capacity building of engineers in\nMOWRAM and its provincial offices, commencing early in 2001.\n\n27.\nThe Australian  Agency for  International  Development  (AusAID),  in  association  with  the\nInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI), has been assisting the Government since 1998 to\ndevelop agriculture research institutions and to support research programs for the development\nof improved rice varieties and rice-based farming systems. AusAID is also providing a $7 million\ngrant  for  1997-2002  for  institutional  strengthening  and  human  resource  development  of  the\nnational agricultural extension system. These programs have contributed to increasing the area\nof  high-yield  variety  (HYV)  rice  under  irrigated  farming  during  the  dry  season.  Deutsche\nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  is  providing  assistance  in  agriculture\nextension as part of its Kompong Thom provincial development project.\n\nSeveral  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  provided  assistance  for  the\n28.\nrehabilitation of small-scale irrigation systems in the country. Their activities commenced in the\nearly  1990s,  preceding  bilateral  and  multilateral  assistance.  In  the  project  area,  the  Adventist\nDevelopment  and  Relief  Agency  (ADRA)  is  developing  groundwater  resources  and  village\n\n                                               \n12\n\nTA 3292-CAM: Capacity Building in the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, for  $796,000,  approved\non 10 November 1999.\n\n\f8\n\nvegetable farming, helped form a district water management committee to operate and maintain\nwells and sanitation facilities, and built a market at Tang Krasang town.\n\n29.\nConstruction of rural roads has been successfully supported by the International Labour\nOrganization  (ILO)  since  1992  and  ADB  since  1996.  The  Tertiary  Roads  Improvement\nProgramme,  a  cooperative  arrangement  between  MRD,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)\nand  World  Food  Programme,  is  rehabilitating  roads  in  parts  of  Kompong  Thom.  All  these\nprojects use LBAT and recruit large groups of laborers from local communities that will use the\nroads.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe  1999  ADB  Portfolio  Review  Mission  found  that  the  Government\u2019s  project\n30.\nimplementation  capacity  is  generally  good,  although  weak  in  specific  areas.  Government\nagencies suffer from a  shortage  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff, due  to poor  initial  conditions\naffected  by  civil  turmoil  in  the  past  and  low  civil  service  salaries.  Many  staff  trained  under\nexternally-assisted  projects  and  programs  are  quickly  absorbed  by  the  private  sector.\nFurthermore, time-consuming decision  making,  including  lack  of  delegation  of  authority  to  the\nproject  implementation  office,  has  constrained  the  implementation  of  some  projects.  The\nexperience of other funding agencies and NGOs in the country verifies these findings.\n\n31.\nSome  parts  of  Cambodia  suffer  from  a  low  level  of  social  cohesion  due  to  years  of\npolitical and military conflict. Externally-assisted projects that include cooperative arrangements\nbetween  beneficiaries  have  proven  human-resource \nintensive,  and  require  substantial\ninvestments of time and energy to mobilize participants. For irrigation projects, farmers need to\nbe convinced of the benefits of cooperation, they need to realize these benefits within the life of\nthe investment, and their organizations need to be recognized by the Government and protected\nby a legal framework.\n\n32.\n\nThe following lessons have been incorporated into the design of the Project:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nProject design should be kept simple.\n\nProvincial  and  district  agencies  of  the  Government  should  have  active  roles  in\nimplementing projects that require beneficiary participation.\n\nPrior to the commencement of physical works, an agreement should be reached\nwith  beneficiaries  regarding  general  design  features,  intended  implementation\napproach, and subsequent O&M arrangements.\n\nThe  availability  of  sufficient  counterpart  funds  during  project  implementation\nshould be confirmed and closely monitored.\n\nAdequate consulting services must be provided to ensure the  timely  completion\nof  surveys,  detailed  designs,  and  effective  supervision  of  implementation.\nRealistic  implementation  schedules  must  provide  adequate  lead  time  for\npreparatory activities, especially for beneficiary consultations.\n\n(vi) \n\nSufficient  authority  should  be  delegated  to  the  project  implementation  office  to\navoid implementation delays.\n\n\f9\n\nSome of these findings are  mirrored  in ADB\u2019s analysis of past  projects  in  the  irrigation\n33.\nand rural development sector.13 Of particular relevance is the importance of close involvement\nof beneficiaries in project design, implementation, and management. This builds a foundation of\nownership that is a necessary condition for successful farmer participation in O&M and for cost\nrecovery.  But  strong ownership  alone  is  not enough; farmers and  key  institutions  also  require\nadequate  training.  Finally,  when  local  capabilities  are  constrained  by  financial,  technical,  and\nsociocultural  factors,  a  process  approach  is  recommended  to  ensure  flexibility  in  design,\nimplementation, and operation of irrigation systems.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n34.\nThe  major  thrusts  of  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  include  (i)  pro-poor\nsustainable  economic  growth  in  populous  rural  areas,  (ii)  human  resource  and  social\ndevelopment, and  (iii)  promotion  of  private  sector  participation  that  addresses  key  institutional\nand infrastructure weaknesses. The COS recognizes that agricultural and rural development are\nkey  to  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth  in  Cambodia.  In  this  context,  key  areas  for\nimproving  agricultural  productivity  include  (i) providing  and  properly  maintaining  critical\ninfrastructure for irrigation, drainage, and rural transport; (ii) strengthening agricultural research\nand extension; (iii) promoting the private-sector participation in input supply, product processing,\nand marketing; and (iv) providing effective rural financial services.\n\n35.\nADB\u2019s strategy is to assist the Government to develop a comprehensive approach to the\nwater  sector  with  clearly  defined  authority  across  agencies,  modalities  for  stakeholder\nparticipation  in  setting  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  water  users,  and  separation  of  the\nresponsibilities  for  water  resource  management  and  service  delivery.  ADB's  capacity  building\nTA is a first step in this direction. The TA includes (i) detailed sectoral overview, (ii) formulation\nof investment strategies, (iii) establishment of the institutional framework for sustainable O&M of\nirrigation  systems,  (iv)  identification  of  an  action  agenda  for  the  draft  national  water  sector\npolicy, and  (v)  strengthening  of  planning  and  implementation  capacities.  These  processes  will\nbe enhanced by  implementation  of  the  Project.  ADB  will  also  facilitate  aid  coordination  in  the\nwater  sector  to  promote  a  common  approach  in  areas  such  as  water  user  organizations  for\nO&M  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  water  policies  and  laws,  and  sectoral  responsibilities  across\nGovernment agencies.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nThe Government\u2019s new policy on farmer management of irrigation systems is a key step\n36.\nto  ensuring  sustainability  of  future  investments.  Farmer  ownership  of  irrigation  investments  is\ndeveloped  by  ensuring  farmer  participation  in  all  aspects  of  development,  from  planning  and\ndesign to construction and management. Full ownership of the system increases the likelihood\nthat farmers will shoulder a substantial share of costs for O&M. Although the new policy is being\nimplemented in AFD\u2019s Prey Nup project, the EU Le Programme de R\u00e9habilitation et d\u2019Appui au\nSecteur  Agricole  (PRASAC)  project  and  elsewhere,  it  needs  to  be  supported  by  a  legal\nframework, and adjustment of the method for calculating water user fees may be needed. The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  implement  the  policy  under  the  Project  on  a  pilot  basis,  for\nrefinement based on practical experience and especially the views of farmers. The Government\nis  also  sponsoring  a  series  of  national  workshops  and  field  trips  to  give  all  stakeholders,\nincluding the aid community, an opportunity to contribute to policy development.

Sector  Synthesis  of  Postevaluation  Findings  in  the  Irrigation  and  Rural\n\nDevelopment Sector. Manila.\n\n\f10\n\nterm goal of these refinements is to achieve 100 percent cost recovery for  O&M  of  secondary\ncanals  and  structures  and  on-farm  facilities;  the  long-term  goal  of  the  policy  is  to  achieve  full\ncost recovery for all O&M activities.\n\nADB  recognizes  good  governance  as  one  of  the  pillars  of  a  sound  poverty  reduction\n37.\nstrategy,  especially  elements  of  accountability \nfor  Government  employees,  people\u2019s\nparticipation in the development process, predictability in the application of rules and laws, and\ntransparency  in  public  sector  decision  making.  The  Project  is  designed  to  maximize  people\u2019s\nparticipation from design to construction, to management of all major components. The role of\nfarmers  in  irrigation  system  management  will  ensure  not  only  that  decision  making  is\ntransparent,  but  that  key  decisions  are  made  by  the  farmers  themselves.  Governance  issues\nidentified  in  Cambodia  that  are  directly  relevant  to  the  Project  include  lack  of  independent\nauditing  agencies,  land  disputes,  and  highly  centralized  administrative  structures.14  The\nProject's  design addresses  the  audit  issue  by financing  independent external  audits  based on\ninternational auditing standards.\n\nLandownership, registration, and titling are crucial issues for  the  success of agriculture\n38.\nimprovement,  especially  irrigation  projects.  As  land  values  increase  with  the  expectation  of\nirrigation, there is a risk that target beneficiaries may be alienated from their lands because they\nlack  land  title  or  even  less  formal  documentation,  such  as  land  certificates  issued  by  local\ncommune chiefs. The Government\u2019s draft  land  law, prepared  with  ADB  assistance,  addresses\nmany outstanding  issues  on  land  policy, and  was  presented  to  the  National  Assembly  in  July\n2000. Once the law is adopted, detailed rules and regulations will be needed to implement it. A\nrecently  passed  subdecree15  will  simplify  and  accelerate  the  procedures  for  land  titling  of\nindividual  parcels,  using  a  new  orthophotomapping  and  survey  process  developed  in  the\nDepartment  of  Cadastre  and  Geography,  with  assistance  from  GTZ  and  the  Government  of\nFinland. This process will be used in the project area in the first two years of implementation to\nassist target beneficiaries to obtain land titles.\n\nfor \n\ninitiative \n\nthe  Government\u2019s \n\nBy establishing development committees at village, commune, and provincial levels, the\n39.\nASP  provided  support \nto  decentralize  planning  and\nimplementation  of  development  interventions,  and  involve  target  beneficiaries  in  their  own\ndevelopment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  supported  a  similar effort\nfrom the early 1990s. From that experience, the Government is now moving to establish elected\ncommune  councils  by  early  2001.  Although  the  functions  of  commune  councils  and  their\nrelationship with national Government representatives at provincial and district levels, as well as\nwith  the existing development  committees are  yet  to be  defined,  the  councils  are  expected  to\nplay  a  key  role  in  planning  and  implementing  development  activities  in  the  concerned\ncommunes. In terms of project implementation, the focus of institutional strengthening will be at\nthe  provincial  and  district  levels,  and  that  of  extension  services  at  the  commune  and  village\nlevels.  Focusing  on  the  different  levels  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  services  in  the  project\narea  and  recognizes  that  MOWRAM  and  other  agencies  need  substantial  human  resource\ndevelopment at the local level. This strategy requires MOWRAM to dedicate more resources to\nKompong Thom; the ministry has committed to do this.\n\n                                               \n14  Kato,  T.,  J.  A.

Subdecree  on  the  Procedure  of  Establishing  Cadastral  Index  Map  and  Land\n\nRegister. Phnom Penh: Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction.\n\n\f11\n\nAlthough the Government has limited capacity to enforce the Agricultural Materials Law,\n40.\nwhich establishes a  regime  to  control  the supply and use of certain pesticides,  fertilizers,  and\nanimal  medicines,  MAFF  is  committed  to  reducing  the  demand  for  dangerous  substances  by\nsupporting  integrated  pest  management  (IPM).  The  Project  follows  a  similar  approach  by\nincluding IPM as part of a package of agricultural extension services, and provides training for\nprovincial MAFF extension workers on IPM techniques and dissemination.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n41.\nThe  Government  places  high  priority  on  reducing  poverty  by  improving  the  rural\neconomy.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  Cambodia  supports  this  objective  by  focusing  investments  in  the\npopulous  and  poor  rural  areas  of  the  plains  and  Tonle  Sap  region,  such  as  Kompong  Thom\nProvince.  The  provincial  economy  is  dominated  by  rural  subsistence  or  semisubsistence\nfarming  dependent  on  one  low-yield  rain-fed  rice  crop  per  year,  with  limited  employment  and\nincome-generating opportunities during the dry season. Periodic droughts in the wet season, or\nsevere flooding, force families  into  debt  to  meet  their  subsistence  food  needs.  Due  to  lack  of\nirrigation,  most  lands  lie  barren  and  fallow  in  the  dry  season.  The  project  area  presents  an\nopportunity to address these problems as it has abundant water resources, an existing irrigation\nsystem  that  will  need  only  low-cost  rehabilitation,  and  its proximity  to  a  major  highway  and  to\nPhnom Penh.\n\n42.\nThe provision of irrigation and drainage, rural roads, and markets can have an important\nimpact on agricultural productivity. In the wet  season,  reliable flows and drainage  ensure  crop\nsurvival  during  drought  periods  and  floods,  reduce  the  risk  of  investing  in  inputs,  and,  when\ncombined  with  the  introduction  of  modern  rice  varieties,  permit  double  cropping.  Dry  season\nirrigation  will  provide a  large boost  to  farmers'  incomes,  and  permit  the  adoption  of  high-yield\nvarieties and diversification  into higher  value  cash  crops.  Improved  roads  (most  rural  roads  in\nthe project area are impassable except by oxcart) will reduce vehicle and harvesting costs, and\nallow  greater  and  timely  use  of  inputs,  while  stimulating  other  economic  activities.  Improved\nmarkets will reduce spoilage and transaction costs.\n\n43.\nThe  returns  to  investments  in  hardware  can  be  greatly  enhanced  by  complementary\ninvestments in human capital. Thus, training in improved agricultural techniques, IPM, and on-\nfarm water management should go hand in hand with the provision of irrigation. Participation in\nconstruction  and  the  O&M  of  roads  and  irrigation  systems  imparts  skills  to  beneficiaries,\nprovides  much-needed employment, and  ensures  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure.  Finally,  if\nfarmers are assisted in obtaining legal title to their lands, they are much more likely to invest in\nimproved  agricultural  techniques  and  technology,  and  to  participate  in  O&M  of  the  irrigation\nsystem.\n\n44.\nIn  combination,  these  hardware  and  software  investments  can  stimulate  the  rural\neconomy and have a measurable impact on farmers' incomes. By improving rural infrastructure\nand establishing a workable system for agricultural extension, crop diversification, and farmer-\nmanaged  irrigation,  the  Project  will  also prepare the  way for a  second-stage  investment  in  an\nupstream dam that will greatly expand dry season irrigation.\n\n\fB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n12\n\n45.\nThe primary objectives of the  Project  are  to  raise  agricultural  productivity and  increase\nfarmers'  incomes  by  providing  irrigation  and drainage for  7,000  ha,  and  improving  rural  roads\nand markets in and around the project area. The Project will also (i) form and train water user\ngroups to operate and maintain the irrigation system, (ii) apply cost recovery measures for roads\nand irrigation works, (iii) strengthen Government staff at the central and provincial level, and (iv)\nconduct benefit monitoring and evaluation.\n\n46.\n\nThe Project will have the following components.\n\n1.\n\nIrrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\n\na.\n\nFarmer Community Organization and Extension Services\n\n47.\nThis component will address the software requirements for ensuring that the provision of\nwater results in sustainable increases in agricultural productivity that benefit local farmers. The\ncomponent  involves  investing  in  human  resource  development,  community  organization  and\ntraining, and applied research and extension, through three subcomponents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLandownership survey and documentation for land registration and titling. Using\northophotomapping and ground surveys, the Project will assist farmers to obtain\nlegal  title  to  their  lands.  Completed  orthophotomaps  will  also  be  used  for  the\ndetailed design of water offtakes from the secondary canals and for the formation\nof water user groups.\n\nWater user groups.  The  Project  will  help  mobilize,  form,  and  train  farmer  water\nuser  groups  (WUGs),  who  will  elect  members  to  the  farmer  water  user\ncommunities (WUCs) at the secondary canal level. The WUGs and WUCs will be\nthe  focal  points  for  farmer  participation  in  system  design  and  O&M,  and  for\ntraining in water management.\n\nAgriculture extension  services  and  research.  The  Project  will  provide  extension\nservices including farmer field schools and demonstrations on IPM, improved rice\nseed  and  rice  farming  techniques,  crop  diversification,  land  leveling,  animal\nhusbandry, and postharvest practices. Provincial government agencies\u2019 capacity\nto provide long-term extension services will be strengthened.\n\nb.\n\nIrrigation Infrastructure\n\nCivil  works  under  this  component  will  (i)  repair  the  main  diversion  weirs  on  the  Stung\n48.\nChinit  river  and  its  tributary,  the  Stung  Tang  Krasang;  (ii)  repair  flood  bunds,  construct  new\nbunds  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  main  canal,  and  provide  drainage  structures  to  protect  low-\nlying  agricultural  areas  between  the  two  rivers;  (iii)  introduce  a  fish  pass  structure  to  allow\nannual fish migrations; (iv) remodel and repair the main and secondary canals and regulators,\nalong  with  roughly  60  km  of  embankment  service  roads;  (v)  provide  assistance  to  farmers\nconstructing  tertiary  and  quaternary  canals;  (vi)  establish  hydrometeorology  stations  in  the\nStung Chinit catchment area; and (vii) provide field offices and equipment.\n\n\f13\n\nc.\n\nIrrigation System Management\n\n49.\nThe system management component will establish the Stung Chinit irrigation committee,\nresponsible for overall management of the system, and develop a system for farmer-managed\nO&M and cost recovery through WUGs and WUCs. The component will develop the capacity of\nthe  committee  and  MOWRAM  staff  in  all  technical  and  administrative  aspects  of  system\nmanagement.\n\n2.\n\nRural Infrastructure (Part B)\n\n50.\nThis  component  will  improve  roughly  150  km  of  rural  roads  in  and  around  the  project\narea to reduce the cost of transporting inputs and harvested crops, in anticipation of increased\nvolumes  of  both  stemming  from  greater  agricultural  production.  In  addition,  the  Project  will\nupgrade  six  local  markets  that  currently  lack  permanent  roofing,  drainage,  access  to  clean\nwater, truck-loading facilities, and sanitation facilities. The final selection of roads and  markets\nduring  project  implementation  will  give  strong  preference  to  the  views  of  target  beneficiaries\nthrough surveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district levels.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total  project  cost  is estimated  at  about $23.8  million equivalent,  including  physical\n51.\nand  price  contingencies,  duties,  taxes,  and  interest  charges.  Of  this,  about  $9.6  million  or  40\npercent  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost.  Local  currency  costs  including  duties  and  taxes  are\nestimated  at  $14.2  million  equivalent,  or  60  percent  of  the  total  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are\nsummarized in Table 1. Detailed costs estimates are in Appendix 3.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nA.\n     1.  Irrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\n           a.  Farmer Comm.

The Government  and  the\nbeneficiaries  will finance $5.2  million  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost  (22  percent  of  the  total\nproject cost). Beneficiary contribution is through labor to construct tertiary and quaternary canals\nand drains within their parcels.\n\nAs  AFD  funds  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis,  AFD  will  be  responsible  for\n\n53.\nadministering their activities together with MOWRAM, in close coordination with ADB.\n\nSource\n\nADB (including interest\ncharges)\nAFD\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n8.6\n\n1.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n7.4\n\n1.6\n4.8\n0.4\n\n16.0\n\n2.6\n4.8\n0.4\n\n23.8\n\n67\n\n11\n20\n2\n\n100\n\nTotal a\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\na\n\n14.2\n\n9.6\n\nTotals may not tally due to rounding.\n\n54.\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  loan  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s  Special\nFunds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry\nan  interest  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\n55.\nThe  Project  Executing  Agencies  (EAs)  will  be  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and\nMeteorology (MOWRAM) and the Ministry of Rural Development. MOWRAM will be responsible\nfor  three  subcomponents:  farmer  community  organization  and  extension  services,  irrigation\ninfrastructure,  and  irrigation  system  management,  and  MRD  will  be  responsible  for  the  rural\ninfrastructure  component.  The  provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forests  and  Fisheries\n(PDAFF)  will  provide  support  for  agriculture  extension  activities,  along  with  the  Cambodia\nAgriculture Research Development Institute. The Department of Cadastre and Geography of the\nMinistry  of Land  Management,  Urban Planning, and  Construction  (MLM)  will  conduct  the  land\nownership survey and titling activities.\n\nProject  sustainability  depends  on  the  strength  of  institutions,  sense  of  ownership  by\n56.\nGovernment  and  beneficiaries,  and  financial  mechanisms  for  cost  recovery.  Both  MRD  and\nMOWRAM have increased their technical and project management skills considerably  through\n\n\f15\n\npractical experience  on projects financed  by  ADB  and  others.  Although  irrigation  systems  can\nbe  more  complex  to  operate  and  maintain  than  rural  roads,  MOWRAM  will  build  its  skills\ncontinuously  during  the  investment  period  through  on  the  job  training  by  the  implementation\nconsultants, and new or planned institutional strengthening projects.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization and Coordination\n\n57.\nMOWRAM  and  MRD  will  establish  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  at  their\nministries,  headed  by  national  project  directors  at  the  level  of  undersecretary  of  state;  and\nproject implementation units (PIUs) in Kompong Thom, headed by the director of the Provincial\nDepartment  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (PDWRAM)  and  director  of  the  Provincial\nDepartment  of  Rural  Development  (PDRD),  respectively.  Both  PIUs  will  have  full-time  deputy\nproject  managers, plus full-time  engineering,  technical, and administrative  staff.  By the  end  of\nyear  two  of  the  Project,  once  farmer  organizations  are  in  place  and  have  elected  their\nrepresentatives, MOWRAM will establish an office for the Stung Chinit irrigation committee, with\npermanent staff comprising engineers, canal inspectors, and gate operators.\n\n58.\nInterministerial coordination will be provided through a project steering committee (PSC),\nchaired  by  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  and  comprising  the  national  project\ndirectors  from  MOWRAM  and  MRD,  and  representatives  of  other  ministries  involved  in  the\nProject.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  the  Project  and  interagency\ndispute  resolution.  At  the  provincial  level,  a  project  coordination  committee  (PCC)  will  be\nestablished. The PCC will be chaired by the project manager, PIU-MOWRAM, and will include\nthe MRD project manager as deputy chairperson, and representatives from  relevant  provincial\nagencies, the Stung Chinit  resettlement  subcommittee  (SCRS), and  the Stung  Chinit  irrigation\ncommittee.  The  PCC  will  coordinate  implementation  activities  and  make  adjustments  in  work\nprograms. A project organization and coordination chart is in Appendix 4.\n\na.\n\nLand Ownership Survey and Titling\n\nThe  land  ownership  survey  and  titling  component  will  be  implemented  through  the\n59.\nDepartment  of  Cadastre  and  Geography  in  MLM.  The  process  will  begin  with  NGO-led\nworkshops  to  explain  to  villagers  their  land  rights  and  the  planned  cadastral  activities.  The\ndepartment  will  prepare  a  cadastral  index  map  of  villagers\u2019  landholdings  in  the  project  area\nbased  on  aerial  survey,  ground  truthing,  interviews,  demarcation,  and  adjudication  of  land\nparcels.  This  process,  including  procedures  for  dispute  resolution,  is  spelled  out  in  a  new\nsubdecree on the Procedures of Establishing Cadastral Index Map and Land Register. The final\noutput  of  this  component  will  be  land  registration  and  submission  of  all  necessary\ndocumentation for issuance of title certificates for all parcels in the project area.\n\nb.\n\nFarmer Organization\n\nThe guiding philosophy of the irrigation system  is  bottom-up  management.  The  Project\n60.\nwill help form and train WUGs at the 50-ha-block level to participate in the design phase of the\nsystem,  construct  tertiary  and  quaternary  canals  and  drains  with  material  and  TA  from  the\nGovernment,  and  contribute  labor  and  collect  user  fees  to  finance  the  maintenance  of\nsecondary canals and drains. The WUGs will elect representatives to WUCs at  the secondary\ncanal level to represent their interests on the Stung Chinit irrigation committee (para. 64).  The\nWUCs will be responsible for  operating  secondary canals and drains,  will  organize  the  WUGs\n\n\f16\n\nfor canal and drain maintenance, and manage maintenance funds collected from the WUGs. To\nleverage consulting  inputs,  qualified  NGOs  will  be  used  to  mobilize  farmers,  conduct  training,\nand  implement  public  awareness  campaigns\u2014a  model  that  AFD  found  to  be  effective  in\nCambodia.  NGOs  can  also  be  used  to  more  effectively  target  vulnerable  groups  such  as\nhouseholds headed by women, households with disabled persons, and minorities.\n\nc.\n\nAgricultural Extension and Research\n\nExtension activities will include, (i) farmer field schools, (ii) field demonstrations for IPM,\n61.\n(iii) demonstration  plots  for  improved  rice  varieties  and  alternative  dry  season  crops,  (iv)  land\nleveling,  and  (v)  postharvest  processing  to  improve  the  quality  of  milled  rice.  Agriculture\nextension will be based on  the  systems,  expertise, and  materials  developed  in  MAFF  and the\nprovincial Office of Technique, Economic and Extension (OTEE), which will be the Implementing\nAgency  for  this  component.  The  Cambodia  Agriculture  Research  Development  Institute\n(CARDI)  will  conduct  adaptive  research  activities  to  support  OTEE  in  the  field.  AFD  plans  to\nexpand  the  agricultural  extension  services  subcomponent  to  include  microcredit  facilities  for\nfarmers,  through  their  ongoing  work  with  Ennatien  Moulethan  Tchonnebat  (EMT),  a  local\nmicrofinance institution.\n\nd.\n\nIrrigation Infrastructure\n\n62.\nThe irrigation infrastructure component will be managed by the PIU in Kompong Thom,\nwith  the  assistance  of  the  implementation  consultants  and  monitored  by  the  PMO.  Major  civil\nworks  including  remodeling  of  the  main  canal  and  rehabilitation  of  the  weirs  and  control\nstructures  in  the  main  and  secondary  canals  will  be  undertaken  by  a  contractor  engaged\nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Simple  earthworks  for  secondary  canals  and\ndrains may be contracted directly to WUCs and WUGs, under the technical guidance of the PIU\nand  implementation  consultants,  or  through  civil  works  contracts  that  require  the  use  of  local\nlabor along the canal wayleave. The guiding philosophy of the civil works is participation of the\ntarget  beneficiaries  in  determining  the  location  of  offtakes,  ease  of  O&M,  and  longevity  of\nstructures.  Farmers  will  participate  in  system  design  from  the  outset  to  determine  the  optimal\narrangement of canals, drains, and water management structures. At least two thirds of farmers\nalong  each  secondary  canal  in  the  command  area  will  have  to  endorse  and  sign  off  on  the\ndesign  of  secondary  canals  and  offtakes  and  tertiary  block  boundaries  before  they  are\nincorporated in the overall design.\nFor  some  small  civil  works,  such  as  the  rehabilitation  of\nflood  embankments  east  of  the  diversion  weirs,  the  United  Nations  World  Food  Programme\n(WFP) will also participate to target vulnerable groups that do not directly benefit from irrigation,\nand provide rice, fish, oil, and salt as payment to participants doing piece work.\n\n63.\nMOWRAM  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  main  canal,  weirs,  cross-regulators  and\ncross-drainage  structures.  The  Project  will  provide  funds  for  routine  maintenance,  but  on  a\ndeclining  percentage  over  time,  and  the  Government  share  of  maintenance  will  increase\nproportionately to 80 percent of the total during project implementation. The total annual budget\nrequirement of about $130,000 equivalent for the Government's contribution to O&M is modest\nin relation to total GDP and the national revenue budget. WUCs will be responsible for O&M of\nsecondary canals, using labor and funds raised through fees collected by WUGs equivalent to\nabout  $10/ha.  This  is  affordable  to  farmers  who  in  the  most  pessimistic  scenario  will  gain  a\nminimum  of $84  in  annual  income  just  from  supplemental  wet  season  irrigation.  Farmers  that\nalso  receive  dry  season  irrigation  will  be  expected  to  pay  higher  fees  reflecting  higher  water\nusage.  Social assessments  completed  during  project  preparation  found  farmers  willing  to  pay\nwater user fees. AFD and EU agriculture projects in Cambodia have successfully implemented\n\n\f17\n\nfees of the same magnitude, with payment in cash, rice, or labor. Their experience shows that\nuser  fees  should  not  be  imposed  from  above,  but  rather  developed  through  a  consensus  of\nWUG membership. Not surprisingly, farmers are  more  willing  to  make  contributions once they\nrealize  measurable  gains  from  agriculture.  It  is  therefore  unrealistic  to  expect  significant  fee\ncollection in the early stages of the Project. The objective of user fees is to eventually recover\n100 percent of the costs of O&M of secondary canals and structures.\n\ne.\n\nIrrigation System Management\n\n64.\nThe  system  will  be  managed  by  the  Stung  Chinit  irrigation  committee,  comprising\nelected  representatives  from  the  WUCs  and  PDWRAM  technical  staff.  The  committee  will  be\nchaired by a representative of the WUC, and will have farmers as majority members. At least 20\npercent  of  seats  on  the  committee  will  be  reserved  for  women,  reflecting  the  share  of\nhouseholds headed by women in the project area. The committee, with assistance from the PIU\nand  implementation  consultants,  will  (i)  develop  gate  operating  schedules;  (ii)  calibrate\nstructures  to  ensure  equitable  distribution  of  water;  (iii)  prepare  maintenance  schedules  and\nbudgets and package routine maintenance tasks into contracts for the WUCs/WUGs; (iv) foster\nactive  farmer  participation,  through  the  WUCs  and  WUGs,  in  system  O&M  activities,  and\n(v) prepare  a  detailed O&M  manual to guide future  management  of  the  system.  A  diagram  of\nsystem management arrangements is presented in Appendix 5.\n\nf.\n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n65.\nThe  rural  infrastructure  component  will  be  implemented  by  PDRD,  with  technical\nguidance  and  support  from  MRD  and  the  implementation  consultants.  Roads  will  be\nrehabilitated  in  the  command  area  of  the  irrigation  system  and  peripheral  areas  in  Baray  and\nSantuk  districts  using  the  LBAT  model  pioneered  and  used  successfully  in  Cambodia  by  ILO\nsince 1992, and currently used in ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (RIIP). Under\nthe  LBAT  model,  up to 40  percent of  road  construction  expenditures  are  paid  directly  to  local\ncommunities  as  wages.  PDRD  or  beneficiary  groups  will  propose  individual  road  links  and\nmarkets for consideration by the Provincial Rural Development Committee (PRDC). PDRD will\nprepare  detailed  financial  and  economic  appraisals  for  all  proposals.  PRDC  will  recommend\npriority roads and markets to MRD according to the selection criteria used in RIIP.\n\nRural  roads  will  require  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.16  The  Project  will  provide\n66.\nfinancial  support  to  cover  the  maintenance of  rural  roads,  but on  a  declining  share  over  time,\nand  the Government share  of  maintenance  will  increase  proportionately.  This  will  ensure  that\nthe  Government  shoulders  the  burden  of  maintenance  before  the  Project  is  completed.  The\nProject  will  test  alternative  surfacing  materials  that  carry  a  higher  capital  cost  but  lower\nmaintenance costs, and assess their technical and economic viability as well as replicability in\nthe Project, taking into account the initial testing being conducted with the assistance of ILO.17\nFinally, the Project will experiment with the formation of road user committees to mobilize local\nfunds and labor for maintenance, as described in MRD\u2019s policy on rural roads (para. 21).\n\n                                               \n16  Routine maintenance must  be  done  on  a regular  basis to  ensure  the  continued  operation  of roads.  It  includes\nactivities such as filling potholes. This is conducted at relatively low cost ($300 per year per kilometer) using the\nLBAT model. Periodic maintenance involves overlaying of surface materials once every three to five years with a\nmaximum cost of $4,000 per kilometer.\n\n17  An  initial  assessment  by  ILO  indicates  that  using  basalt  blocks  for  road  surfacing  requires  high  initial\ninvestments, but may prove to be economically viable over the long run due to substantially lower maintenance\nrequirements. This finding needs to be assessed on a wider scale.\n\n\f18\n\nFor  the  O&M  of  rural  markets,  the  Project  will  follow  the  design  under  RIIP,  by\n67.\nestablishing  market  committees  in  district  or  commune  councils  before  upgrading  the  market\nwith  the agreement  of  market  traders.18  The  committee  will  operate  the  market,  and  establish\nstall  rental  fees  that  will  cover  at  least  the  cost  for  regular  O&M  and  a  fund  for  further\nmaintenance and improvement of the market.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Arrangements under Parallel Financing\n\nADB and AFD have agreed on the general activities, cost estimates, and outline terms of\n68.\nreference for the farmer organization and agricultural extension component. AFD may improve\nthe design of the component, reflecting its broad experience in Cambodia. All such changes will\nbe  agreed  upon  beforehand  with  ADB.  As  parallel  financiers,  AFD  and  MOWRAM  will\nadminister  the component. Because of  the  close  linkages between  the  components  in  part  A,\nAFD-  and ADB-financed  consultants  will  work  together  as  a  team,  share  the  same  PIU  office\nspace, and attend  meetings of the  PCC,  National  Steering  Committee,  or  other  bodies  where\nthe  presence  of  implementation  consultants  is  required.  Furthermore,  both  groups  of\nconsultants  will  produce  joint  progress  and  project  completion  reports,  participate  in  benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation, and participate jointly in midterm reviews. These understandings will\nbe  specified  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  be  signed  by  AFD,  ADB,  and  MOWRAM\nprior to loan effectiveness.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n69.\nThe  overall  project  implementation  period  is  six  years.  In  the  first  two  years,  the\nlandownership survey and titling activities will be completed, as well as technical investigations,\nconsultations  with  farmers  on  overall  system  management  approach  and  system  layout,\ndetailed  design,  and  any  necessary  resettlement  and/or  compensation  programs.  Civil  works\nwill  proceed  gradually,  beginning  with  the  2,000  ha  designated  for  year-round  irrigation,  and\nproceeding to the remaining 5,000 ha that will receive supplemental wet season irrigation. The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\n70.\nProcurement. ICB will be used for major civil works contracts in excess of $1 million and supply\ncontracts over $500,000.  Specifically,  in  the  irrigation  infrastructure  component,  civil  works  for\nthe  rehabilitation  of  Stung  Chinit  and  Stung  Tang  Krasang  weirs,  Stung  Chinit  spillway,  main\ncanal  structures  and  earthworks  will  be  grouped  in  one  package  and  undertaken  by  a\nprequalified contractor to be engaged through ICB.  Prequalification  criteria  will  be  designed  to\nensure that the international contractor or associates have adequate experience and  technical\nand financial capabilities. All other civil works related to this component involve low-technology,\nlabor-intensive construction and are unlikely to be of interest to international contractors. These\ncivil  works  will  be  contracted  directly  to  WUCs  and  WUGs  and  undertaken  through  force\naccount, or packaged for local contractors through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n71.\nBecause  of  the  simple  nature  of  the  civil  works  for  the  rural  infrastructure  component,\nthey  are  unlikely  to  be  of  interest  to  international  contractors.  The  civil  works  for  road\n\n                                               \n18 \n\nIn markets where the private sector is willing to take on the responsibility of improving facilities, the Project will\nlimit the activities to upgrading common infrastructure such as roads, paving, and drainage.\n\n\f19\n\nimprovement  will  be  undertaken  through  LCB  wherever  possible,  using  labor-intensive\ntechniques, and in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. Alternatively, these will also\nbe implemented through the recruitment of labor groups from among beneficiaries by the PIU on\na force account basis.\n\n72.\nMaterials and equipment to be financed under the Project  will  consist  mainly of  laterite\nfor  surfacing,  service  vehicles,  motorcycles,  a  small  amount  of  construction  equipment,  and\noffice furnishing and equipment. Laterite will be procured through LCB or by force account if it is\nextracted  by  beneficiary  labor.  Other  supply  contracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  will  be\nawarded under international shopping. The procurement of materials and equipment worth less\nthan  $100,000  per  contract  will  be  undertaken  through  direct  purchase.  Tentative  contract\npackages are included in Appendix 7.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement of Loan Proceeds\n\n73.\nTo ensure the timely release of loan proceeds, Imprest Accounts will be established for\nMOWRAM and MRD, who will manage fund flows to their respective PIUs at the provincial level.\nThe imprest accounts will be operated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nFor  further  simplification  of  disbursements,  the  EAs  can  use  the  statement  of  expenditure\nprocedure for contracts costing less than $50,000 or the equivalent in local currency.\n\n6.\n\nConsulting and NGO Services\n\n74.\nThe  Government  will  engage  ADB-financed  consultants  through  several  packages  to\nassist  in  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  transfer  of  technology.  MOWRAM  will  recruit\nconsultants  for  part  A  comprising  77  person-months  of  international  and  202  of  domestic\nspecialists with expertise in engineering for detailed irrigation design, supervision of civil works,\ntraining, project and contract management, and fisheries. The lead firm will act as engineer for\nirrigation  system  design  and  construction,  with  sufficient  delegated  authority  to  effectively\nsupervise the ICB contract on behalf of MOWRAM, and liability for successful completion of civil\nworks. MRD will recruit consultants for part B comprising 15 person-months of international and\n60  of  domestic  specialists  with  expertise  in  road  and  market  engineering,  supervision  of  civil\nworks,  training,  and  social  organization  and  mobilization.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the use of domestic consultants.\n\nAFD  will  use  its  own  procedures  for  recruiting  consultants  for  the  farmer  community\n75.\norganization  and  extension  services  component  of  part  A,  comprising  22  person-months  of\ninternational  and  156  of  domestic  specialists.  Expertise  is  required  in  mobilization  of  farmers\nand  organization  of WUGs,  and  agronomy.  Domestic  NGOs  will  be  recruited  under  the  AFD-\nfinanced component to assist with farmer mobilization, training, and socioeconomic surveys. For\nthe fisheries research and water quality monitoring activities, AFD will engage the Mekong River\nCommission Secretariat (MRCS) on a sole-source basis because of its extensive experience in\nthe  field  and  in  the  ongoing  project  for  Management  of  Freshwater  Capture  Fisheries  (which\nruns through 2005).\n\n76.\nThe relatively large input of consulting services is justified by the integrated cross-sector\ndesign of the Project, the importance of  organizing and  training farmers to  ensure  sustainable\nO&M of the system, the lack of strong social cohesion in rural areas, and the low level of human\nresource  capacity  at  the  provincial  level  of  Government  to  manage  the  system  at  the  outset.\nFurthermore, many of the skills and technology transferred under the Project can be applied to\n\n\f20\n\nfuture water resource development projects, and thus confer a benefit beyond the Project. The\noutline  terms  of  reference  for  loan-  and  grant-financed  consulting  services  are  presented  in\nAppendix 8.\n\n7.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\n77.\nAt  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  has  approved  advance  procurement  action  in\nengaging the ADB-financed consultants. By starting the  time-consuming  process of  consultant\nselection  early,  it  will  be  possible  to  avoid  implementation  delays  and  rapidly  start  farmer\nmobilization  and  irrigation  system  design.  MOWRAM  and  MRD  have  been  advised  that  the\napproval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n\n8.\n\nMidterm Reviews\n\n78.\nADB will conduct regular annual reviews throughout project implementation. MOWRAM,\nMRD,  ADB,  and  AFD  will  jointly  undertake  two  comprehensive  midterm  reviews,  in  mid-2002\nand end-2004. The reviews will cover the entire Project to determine whether adjustments are\nnecessary  in  system  design,  implementation  arrangements,  and  fund  allocation.  The  reviews\nwill  also  address  outstanding  procurement  problems,  financing  and  scheduling  matters,  the\ndevelopment  impact  of  the  Project,  and  progress  of  the  training  programs  and  farmer\norganization.\n\n9.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nMOWRAM and MRD will  maintain  records and accounts  adequate  to  (i)  identify  goods\n79.\nand  services  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  from  counterpart  local  funds;\n(ii) identify the use of these goods and services for  the Project;  (iii)  record  the progress of  the\nProject, including its costs; and (iv) reflect, in accordance with sound accounting principles, the\nProject\u2019s  operational  and  financial  condition.  MOWRAM  and  MRD,  with  assistance  from  the\nimplementation consultants, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports covering\nitems  (i)  through  (iv).  The  detailed  format  for  these  reports  will  be  included  in  the  Project\nAdministration Memorandum (PAM).\n\n80.\nIn  preparing  the  project  accounts,  MOWRAM  and  MRD  will  make  use  of  the  Project\nAccounting  Manual  prepared  for  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  with  ADB\nassistance. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by an\ninternationally  qualified  accountant,  using  loan  proceeds.  Audited  reports  and  financial\nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 12 months after the fiscal year to which they\nrelate.\n\n10.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n81.\nAs  one  of  the  larger  irrigation  development  projects  to  be  undertaken  in  Cambodia  in\nrecent  times,  this  project  provides  an  opportunity  to  assess  the  development  and  success  of\nfarmer group formation and capacity building where there is little prior experience, and provides\nsufficient  period  to  adjust  O&M  procedures  over  time  based  on  early  results.  As  current\ncropping patterns, sources of income, and other features of households in the project area are\nnot  homogeneous,  careful  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  can  reveal  both  the\ngeographic  distribution  of  benefits,  and  the  Project\u2019s  success  in  reaching  the  most  needy,\nvulnerable  households.  Success  hinges  on  adequate  baseline  data  and  consistent  follow-up\nsurveys. The implementation consultant will compile socioeconomic baseline data using the (i)\n\n\f21\n\n1997  TA  social  assessment;  (ii)  a  recent  household  survey  prepared  by  AFD;  (iii) latest\nCambodia Socioeconomic  Survey  (CSES);  (iv)  annual  provincial,  district,  and  commune  data;\nand  (v)  if  necessary,  additional  household  surveys.  Follow-up  socioeconomic  surveys  will  be\nconducted  at  midterm  and  near  completion  by  the  PIUs  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultant\nand participation of local communities either directly or under the auspices of the NGO involved\nin  farmer  mobilization.  The  follow-up  surveys  will  measure  the  impact  on  cropping  intensity,\nyields, crop diversification, transport costs, farmer incomes, and general economic activity. The\nProject will also be monitored for environmental impacts through a research program to test the\neffectiveness  of  the  fish  pass  structure,  and  through  water  quality  monitoring  to  test  the\neffectiveness  of  IPM  training.  The  MRCS  will  manage  both  activities  in  coordination  with  the\nPDWRAM  PIU,  with  financing  from  AFD.  To  the  extent  possible,  target  beneficiaries  will  be\ninvolved in monitoring activities.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n82.\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  and  an  initial  environmental\nexamination  (IEE)  was  conducted  as  part  of  project  preparation.  A  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  is\npresented in Appendix 9. Two major environmental concerns associated with the Project are the\nimpacts  of  the  restored  weirs  on  migratory  fish  and  the  impact  of  the  use  of  pesticide  and\nfertilizers in the project area. The rehabilitation of existing rural roads will not have any negative\nimpact  on  Tonle  Sap  or  other  environmentally  sensitive  areas  along  the  alignment.  Although\nsmall  borrow  pits  may  be  required  for  some  roads,  they  will  be  rehabilitated  with  due\nconsideration  for  the  needs  of  the  local  communities  and,  where  appropriate,  converted  to\nfishponds or to provide water for irrigation of household gardens.\n\n83.\nThe  fish  populations  of  the  Stung  Chinit  and  Stung  Tang  Krasang  can  be  broadly\nclassified  into  two  groups:  fish  of  the  upper  forested  catchment  areas  and  fish  of  the  lower\nsections of the two rivers. There are both migratory and nonmigratory fish in the lower sections\nof  both  rivers.  The  project  impact  on  the  upper  forested  catchment  area  fisheries  will  be\nminimal.  The  Project  will  likely  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  nonmigratory  fish  population\nbecause of the increase in standing water behind the weirs. Fisherfolk living close to the Stung\nChinit and Stung Tang Krasang weirs were unanimous in their opinion that they had greater fish\ncatches  when  the  irrigation  system  was  in  operation  prior  to  1989.  In  the  absence  of  any\nmitigation measures, the  rehabilitation of  the diversion  weirs on  the  two  rivers  would  probably\nhave a negative impact on the migratory fish population during the dry season. To mitigate that\nimpact, a fish pass structure will be constructed at the Stung Chinit weir with a minimum slope\nthat would allow the fish to migrate upstream.\n\nThe use of pesticides in the project area is of concern not only because of the health of\n84.\nthe  farmers  in  the  area  who  work  the  fields  and  consume  the  rice  but  also  for  the  impact  on\nwater  quality,  on  fish  in  rice  paddies  and  downstream,  and  on  livestock  and  waterfowl.  The\nProject will address this issue in the agriculture extension subcomponent, by training WUGs and\nestablishing farmer field schools, and with technical assistance from CARDI. Water  quality  will\nbe monitored throughout the project period to establish a baseline and to assess the efficacy of\nIPM measures.\n\n\f22\n\n2.\n\nBeneficiary Participation in Project Design and Implementation\n\n85.\nA  social  assessment  carried  out  in  1997  included  numerous  focus  group  discussions\nand  workshops  that  elicited  farmer  views  of  the  Project.  The  workshops  revealed  a  general\nconsensus that the Project should proceed as rapidly as possible, a willingness to contribute to\nproject implementation and irrigation system maintenance, and a willingness to donate strips of\nland  where  necessary  for  tertiary  canals  and  drains.  Extensive  household  surveys  conducted\nduring  the  preparation  of  the  Resettlement  Plan  (RP)  in  March  2000,  and  a  socioeconomic\nupdate prepared by AFD in March-April 2000, confirmed these findings. Project implementation\nrelies heavily on beneficiary participation. Designs for secondary canals must be confirmed by\nat least two thirds of the farmers, who will be subcontracted for construction through WUGs or\ndirectly by the civil works contractor. Farmers will operate and maintain the irrigation system up\nto  the  secondary  canal  headworks,  and  will  hold  majority  representation  on  the  Stung  Chinit\nirrigation committee. Rural roads will be selected through a bottom-up approach that focuses on\nmaximizing  cost-effective  positive  impact  for  the  greatest  number  of  people,  and  constructed\nusing the LBAT model, which will generate a large demand for local labor.\n\n86.\nThe beneficiary population includes a high percentage of households headed by women\nand  may  include  some  households  where  the  primary  income  earner  is  disabled.  To  address\nthe  concerns  of  women  and  vulnerable  groups,  special  efforts  will  be  made  during  the  early\nphases of farmer mobilization to ensure full participation in all project activities, including WUGs,\nWUCs, farmer field schools, land titling activities, and system operations.\n\n3.\n\nSocial Impacts and Resettlement\n\n87.\nPreliminary  canal  design  work  indicates  that  about  110  ha  of  Government-owned  land\ncurrently  used  for  recession  rice  (rice  planted  as  floodwaters  recede,  but  without  formal\nirrigation)  will  be  inundated  once  the  weirs  are  repaired.  The  size  of  the  inundation  zone  will\ndecline  steadily  from  the  end  of  the  rainy  season  through  the  dry  season,  allowing  some\nhouseholds  to  continue  recession  rice  agriculture,  but  delayed  by  one  or  two  months.  The\nprimary users of the land come from a nearby village of 73 households. Farmers estimate yields\non  these  sandy  soils  to  be  less  than  1  t/ha.  Although  no  settlements  will  be  flooded  and  no\nphysical  relocation  of  households  is  required,  people  currently  using  lands  that  will  become\npermanently  inundated  will  receive  compensation,  preferably  in  the  form  of  alternate  land  for\nagriculture,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Impacts  from  canal  rehabilitation  are\nexpected  to  be  minor  because  the  rights-of-way  are  already  established,  except  for  22\nhouseholds located on the eastern bank of  the  main  canal, near  the Stung  Chinit  weir.  These\nhouseholds  will  be  relocated  to  an  area  near  the  Stung  Chinit  river  to  preserve  their  primary\neconomic  activity  of  bamboo  collection  upstream.  Rural  roads,  which  will  use  existing\nalignments, and markets, which will be built on existing market land or unoccupied public land\ndonated by the district or commune authorities, are not expected to have adverse impacts.\n\n88.\nAlthough the exact limits of inundation and potential land acquisition for expanded canal\nrights-of-way will not be known until the detailed design phase of the Project, ADB assisted the\nGovernment\u2019s  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  (IRC)  with  the  preparation  of  a  draft\nresettlement plan based on a full census of households that will likely be affected. The draft RP\nwas  prepared  in accordance  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (November  1995)  and\nthe  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  a  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  Where  there  are  differences\nbetween Government procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will govern. The draft RP\nincludes an entitlement matrix, an indicative budget, indicative figures on the number of persons\nthe  Project,  consultative  mechanisms,  grievance  procedures,\nnegatively  affected  by \n\n\f23\n\nimplementation  procedures,  and  details for external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement\nand  compensation.  The draft  RP  will  be  updated  to  include  any  additional  negatively  affected\nhouseholds  identified  during  detailed  design.  An  independent  agency  acceptable  to  ADB,\ntogether with district-level stakeholder groups, will monitor and  evaluate  implementation of the\nRP.\n\n89.\nCompensation and resettlement activities associated with the RP will be coordinated at\nthe national level by the IRC. The IRC will be chaired by MEF, and will include the governor or\ndeputy  governor  of  Kompong  Thom,  the  national  project  director  of  PMO-MOWRAM,\nrepresentatives of other provincial authorities and ministries as appropriate, and representatives\nfrom the affected districts and communes as members. Detailed implementation of the RP will\nbe  conducted  by  the  Stung  Chinit  resettlement  subcommittee  (SCRS),  convened  by  the  IRC\nand chaired by the deputy governor. The draft RP is presented in Appendix 10.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n90.\nThe  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  priority  of\nreducing poverty through growth of the rural economy, which is dominated by agriculture. Lack\nof irrigation is but one of many constraints to agricultural productivity. Cambodia in general and\nthe  project  area  in  particular,  also  suffer  from  extremely  poor  transportation  links,  lack  of\nknowledge about preharvest and postharvest improved agricultural techniques and technology,\nand inadequate marketing links. For these reasons, the Project includes substantial investments\nin rural roads, agricultural extension services, and markets in addition to irrigation infrastructure.\nThe  Project  also  provides  training  for  Government  staff  in  irrigation  design,  construction,  and\nmanagement, as well as agronomy, to ensure transfer of technology and know-how. Because of\nthe  important  role  to  be played by farmers  in  regular O&M  of  the  system,  and  current  lack  of\nexperience in cooperative water resource management, substantial resources are allocated for\nfarmer mobilization and training.\n\n91.\nIn  combination,  these  investments  are  expected  to  increase  agricultural  productivity,\nreduce  farming  costs,  and  stimulate  the  rural  economy.  It  is  probable  that  during  project\nimplementation,  the  skills  developed  therein  will  be  used  to  improve  the  operation  of  other\nMOWRAM  irrigation  systems  elsewhere  in  Kompong  Thom  or  nearby.    However,  benefits\nresulting from the improved operation of these systems have not been included in this economic\nanalysis.\n\n92.\nThe economic analysis is based on a comparison of with- and without-Project scenarios.\nSeparate analyses were conducted for part A and part B, and for the Project as  a  whole.  The\ncost  and  benefits  streams  were  estimated  for  a  20-year  period,  including  6  years  of  Project\nimplementation.  Economic  prices  for  the  main  traded  inputs  are  based  on  World  Bank\ncommodity  price  projections,  and  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  used  to  estimate\neconomic values for nontraded goods.\n\n93.\nThe main benefits accruing from irrigation and agricultural extension include incremental\nrice production, yields of other crops and paddy fish. Road improvement benefits are estimated\nusing  two  conservative  methodologies:  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings  and  increased\nagricultural producer surpluses (APS). VOC savings result from improved road surfaces leading\nto less wear and tear on vehicles, and indirectly from  reduced  charges  associated  with  higher\nvehicle utilization rates (due to reduced journey times) and less expensive modes of transport.\n\n\f24\n\nAPS benefits result from the removal of physical constraints to the transport of bulky items such\nas fertilizer, and from improved seed and surplus crop production. Care has been taken to avoid\ndouble counting of agricultural benefits from roads and irrigation.\n\nMarket  improvement  and  the  landownership  survey  and  titling  subcomponent  are\n94.\nexpected  to  yield  major  benefits  that  have  not  been  quantified.  Consultants  implementing  the\nRIIP in Cambodia estimate that postharvest quality improvements resulting from better  market\nfacilities amount to 2-5 percent of the value of the crop.19\n\n95.\nThe economic costs of part A \u2013 the three components directly concerned with irrigation \u2013\nare combined with the  economic  value  of  incremental agricultural production  to  produce a net\neconomic cash flow over 20 years, yielding an economic internal rate of return (EIRR)  of  15.0\npercent.  The  net  cash  flow  for  rural  infrastructure  yields  an  EIRR  of  32.4  percent,  which  is\nconsistent with that in other ADB-funded rural road projects. The combined Project EIRR is 19.1\npercent.\n\nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  3,  and  full  details  are\n\n96.\npresented in Appendix 11.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Sensitivity Tests and Switching Values\n\nEIRR (percent)\n\nCost\nIncrease\n+ 10%\n\nBenefit\nReduction\n- 20 %\n\nCombined\nCosts +10%\nBenefits \u201320%\n\nSwitching Value at 12%\nDiscount Rate\n\nCosts (%)\n\nBenefits\n(%)\n\n17.2\n\n13.6\n\n29.1\n\n17.0\n\n13.4\n\n28.8\n\n15.2\n\n12.1\n\n25.7\n\n27\n\n94\n\n(20)\n\n(47)\n\nActivity\n\nOverall\n\nBase\nCase\n\n19.1\n\n15.0\n\nIrrigation & Ag.\nExtension\nRural\nInfrastructure\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.\n\n32.4\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\n97.\nThe project beneficiaries  will  include farmers  with  land  in  the  irrigation  command  area,\nand  people  living and  working  within  the areas  of  influence  of  the  project  roads  and  markets.\nThere  is  compelling  evidence  that  the  majority  of  the  beneficiaries  are  poor  by  Cambodian\nstandards. The 1993-1994 Socioeconomic Survey of Cambodia (SESC) provides baseline data\nto measure poverty in the early years following the end of the major civil turmoil. The data reveal\nthat poverty in rural areas was highest, at 40 percent of the population. Even more striking, 46\npercent  of  the  poor  are  in  households  headed  by  farmers,  and  75  percent  are  in  households\ninvolved  in  some  type  of  agricultural  activity.20  The  more  recent  1997  Cambodia  Socio-\nEconomic  Survey  (CSES)  reveals almost no  improvement  in  the  rural  areas:  the  incidence  of\npoverty  declined  marginally  to  39  percent,  and  rural  households  still  accounted  for  nearly  90\n\n                                               \n19     I.T. Transport Ltd. 2000. Market Rehabilitation Sub-Projects: Screening, Selection and Appraisal. Phnom Penh.\n20  Prescott,  N.  and  M.  Pradhan.  1997.  A  Poverty  Profile  for  Cambodia.  World  Bank  Discussion  Paper  No.  373.\n\nWashington: The World Bank.\n\n\f25\n\npercent of Cambodia\u2019s poor in absolute terms. These statistics are based  on a  poverty  line  of\nabout  $0.41 per person  per  day,  which  is  considered  the  bare  minimum  to  meet  daily  caloric\nrequirements plus a nonfood allowance, and is well below the $1 per day standard used by the\nWorld  Bank  and  UN  for  international  comparisons.  The  1997  CSES  also  reveals  growing\ninequality  in the  distribution of  income per  capita,  with urban areas  benefiting  more  than  rural\nareas from economic growth. For example, the rural contribution to the overall poverty gap has\nincreased  from  85  to  88  percent,  and  to  the  poverty  severity  index  from  83  to  89  percent,\ncompared  with  the  1993-94  survey.21  Although  province-specific  data  is  not  readily  available,\nthe  1999  Cambodia  Human  Development  Report  notes  that  the  poorest  villages  in  the  1997\nCSES are located along Tonle Sap, an area that includes the Stung Chinit system and environs.\n\n98.\n AFD\u2019s recent socioeconomic update in the project area provides a much more focused\npicture  of  the  beneficiaries.  AFD  found  that  average  household  income  is  at  the  poverty  line,\nand 60 percent of households surveyed reported income below the poverty line. More than one\nthird of the households surveyed are in debt from the previous year, and half of them borrowed\nmoney  to  cover food  shortages  or  pay  for  basic  medical  care.  Food  deficits  typically  occur  in\nSeptember and November when paddy stocks are depleted before the next harvest.\n\n99.\nThe link between poverty and access to water resources is well established. In Kompong\nThom, lack of irrigation is a key factor in areas of chronic food insecurity. Farmers will not risk\ninvestments  in  better  agricultural  technology  without  reliable  water  supplies,  and  so  remain\nvulnerable  as  subsistence  producers.  Irrigation  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  higher  yields  in\nthe  wet  season  and  opportunities  for  cultivation  of  a  second  wet  season  rice  crop,  new  dry\nseason  crops  including  vegetables  and  legumes,  and  higher  fish  yields  in  paddy  areas.  By\nassisting farmers to obtain legal title to their land, the Project will also provide a major incentive\nfor investments in agricultural productivity. Household margins from agriculture are expected to\nincrease  accordingly,  by  $84-$350  per  year  depending  on  cropping  intensity  and  access  to\nyear-round  irrigation.  This  represents  an  increase  in  annual  income  of  10-40  percent  for  the\naverage household surveyed  by  AFD,  and  should  elevate a  substantial proportion  of  the  poor\nabove the national poverty line. Apart from income, higher  yields of  rice,  other  crops, and fish\nwill improve food security and increase average caloric intake. Early impacts will be captured by\nthe socioeconomic surveys planned for the midterm and at the conclusion of the Project.\n\n100. Benefits  from  roads  and  market  improvement  include  lower  transport  costs;  enhanced\naccess  to  agricultural  extension,  health,  and  education  services;  lower  prices  for  input\npurchases and higher prices for produce sales; and improved access to agricultural inputs. This\nwill directly increase household incomes and reduce the incidence of poverty. The construction\nand  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  works,  roads,  and  markets  will  provide  substantial  direct\nemployment (about 400,000 person-days at $1 per day) for people living in the project area. A\nsurvey of ILO\u2019s ongoing rural road project in Siem Reap Province found that road rehabilitation\nresulted in a doubling of travel trips, 43 percent reduction in travel times, 103 percent increase\nin  loads  carried,  38  percent  reduction  in  passenger  fares,  and  600  percent  increase  in  the\nnumber of local market shops.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n101. Even with unfavorable changes in costs and benefits, the economic returns to the rural\ninfrastructure component are robust. The major risks associated with rural roads is inadequate\nmaintenance.  MRD  fully  understands  the  importance  of  careful  maintenance  planning,  and  is\n\n                                               \n21  Ministry of Planning. 1997. A Poverty Profile of Cambodia \u2013 1997. Phnom Penh.\n\n\f26\n\ncommitted to raising resources through users at the commune or village level, and through labor\ncontributions. The WFP will assist in this regard through their food-for-work initiative already in\nplace  in Kompong  Thom.  It  must  be  noted,  however,  that  although  road  user  committees  are\nincluded  in  MRD\u2019s  new  policy  on  rural  roads,  they  have  not  been  tried  in  practice,  and  this\nstrategy must be viewed as a pilot test in  the  project area.  Two  political  initiatives planned for\n2001 should facilitate the local government\u2019s ability  to  raise  and allocate  resources:  commune\nelections  and  the  Government  decentralization  of  financial  management  and  development\nplanning  through  the  UN-supported  Seila  (foundation  stone)  program.  In  addition,  the  project\ndesign  requires  the Government  to  shoulder a  substantial  share  of  maintenance  expenditures\nduring the investment period, while ADB has strong leverage. Future ADB investments in rural\nroads  should  also  be  conditional  on  the  Government\u2019s  performance  on  maintenance  in  the\nProject.\n\n102.\nThere is also a risk that inadequate maintenance of irrigation infrastructure  will  reverse\nthe  growth  in  crop  yields  as  water  supplies  become  less  reliable.  Success  requires  active\nbeneficiary  participation  to  reduce  the  financial  burden  on  the  Government.  Therefore  the\nProject  allocates  substantial  resources  to  early  and  sustained  investments  in  human  capital.\nThe  economic  returns  to  the  irrigation  components  remain  acceptable  at  12.1  percent  in  the\nevent of a 20 percent reduction in expected benefits and a 10 percent increase in costs. A two-\nyear delay in benefits reduces the EIRR of this component from 15 to 12 percent. The Project\nfaces  a  risk  of  delayed  benefits\u2014directly  through  slow  uptake  of  improved  agricultural\ntechnology  and  water  management,  and  indirectly  through  implementation  delays.  To  ensure\nthat  farmers  are  able  to  benefit  quickly  from  irrigation,  the  Project  includes  substantial\ninvestments for agricultural extension and will work closely with established agencies that have\nconsiderable experience  in  Cambodian  rice farming  systems,  including  IRRI,  AusAID,  CARDI,\nand AFD.\n\n103. A  common  cause  of  implementation  delays  in  Cambodia  is  lack  of  qualified  trained\ncounterpart  staff  with  experience  in  aid-funded  projects.  This  should  not  present  a  serious\nproblem  for  the  Project,  as  both  MRD  and  MOWRAM  have  given  generally  satisfactory\nperformance  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  from  two  new  ADB-\nfinanced TAs: Capacity Building in the Ministry of Water Resources, and Strengthening External\nAid Portfolio Management,22 which will provide assistance in project and financial management\nto all  EAs  of  ADB-financed projects. Provincial  Implementing Agencies  also have  worked  with\nbilateral sources: PDWRAM is receiving training and  material  resources from  the World Bank,\nOTEE  is  working  with  AusAID  to  refine  and  expand  its  agricultural  extension  services,  and\nPDRD is working with KfW and WFP to build roads, and with GTZ on a provincial development\nproject.\n\n104. Rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and rural roads will increase land values in  the\narea.  The  situation  can  lead  to  alienation  of  the  original  inhabitants  by  powerful  and\nunscrupulous interests. Although most of the inhabitants in the project area hold some type of\ndocumentation  for  their  land  issued  by  communal  authorities,  few  have  formal  titles.  For  this\nreason, the Project includes a land registration and titling component that will commence at the\noutset  of  project  implementation.  The  component  also  includes  counseling  and  a  public\nawareness campaign to educate current landowners about their rights and possible remedies in\nthe event that their holdings are threatened.\n\n                                               \n22  TA  3287-CAM:  Strengthening External Aide Portfolio Management,  for  $900,000,  approved  on  2  November\n\n1999.\n\n\f27\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n105.\nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nPrior  to  30  June  2002,  MOWRAM  will  establish  the  Stung  Chinit  irrigation\ncommittee  (SCIC).    At  least  50  percent  of  the  SCIC  members,  including  the\nchairperson, will be elected  representatives from  the  WUCs  in  the  project area.\nAt least 20 percent of seats on the SCIC will be reserved for women. By 30 June\n2003, MOWRAM will have completed construction of a building as headquarters\nfor the SCIC.\n\nAll  environmental  mitigation  measures  set  out  in  the  SIEE  report  will  be\nincorporated  in  the  project  design  and  implemented:  (a)  the  construction  and\ntesting  of  a  fish  pass  structure  on  the  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir,  (b)  periodic\nwater  quality  monitoring,  and  (c)  inclusion  of  IPM  techniques  and  safety\nprograms  on  pesticides  and  fertilizers  as  integral  parts  of  farmer  training\nprograms under the Project.\n\nAll  people  affected  by  the  Project  because  of  either  loss  of  land  or  loss  of\nlivelihood  will  be  compensated  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\nHandbook on Resettlement  and  compensation  measures  set  out  in  the  RP\nagreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Upon  completion  of  the\ndetailed  design  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure  works,  but  prior  to  the  start  of\nconstruction  for  such  works,  the  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  will\nsubmit  to  ADB  for  approval  an  updated  RP  that  identifies  any  other  negatively\naffected persons in addition to those households already identified. The updated\nRP will be prepared in consultation with the affected persons and will specify the\ndetailed  compensation  measures  applicable \nfor  all  affected  people.  An\nindependent,  qualified  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  will  monitor  and  evaluate\nimplementation  of  the  RP.  Stakeholder  monitoring  groups  including  affected\npeople  will  be  established  in  each  district  to  participate  in  the  monitoring  and\nevaluation process.\n\nBy  January  2002,  the  Department  of  Cadastre  and  Geography  will  have\ncompleted  a  survey  of  ownership  in  respect  of  all  land  in  the  project  area,  and\nprepared  and  publicly posted  cadastral  index  maps  in  all  villages  in  the  project\narea. By June 2002, the technical  inspection  of all  undisputed parcels  will  have\nbeen completed for the adjudication record.\n\nThe secondary canals and offtakes and tertiary block boundaries will be prepared\nin  consultation  with  the  farmers  affected  by  such  design.  The  overall  design  of\nthe  irrigation  structure  will  be  completed  only  after  at  least  two  thirds  of  the\nfarmers  along  each  secondary  canal  have  approved  the  designs  for  the\nsecondary canals and offtakes and tertiary block boundaries.\n\n(vi) \n\nPublic  markets  will  be  constructed  only  on  existing  market  sites  or  public  land\nthat is not occupied or used otherwise by private persons. In selecting roads and\nmarkets for upgrading, the Government will take into account the views of target\n\n\f28\n\nbeneficiaries through surveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district\nlevels.\n\n(vii)  MOWRAM  and  MRD  will  ensure  that  maintenance  plans  are  prepared  for  rural\nroads and the main irrigation canal and control structures on the basis of physical\nmeasurements  of  needs  and  agreed-upon  maintenance  standards.  MEF  will\nensure  that  the  budget  will fund the  full  cost  of  the  maintenance  activities  after\nproject  completion.  The  Government  will  apply  the  system  and  financing\narrangements  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  rural  roads  to  be\ndeveloped under the ADB-financed RIIP.\n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that O&M of the irrigation system will be carried out\nin  accordance  with  the  principles  of  its  Implementation  Policy  for  Sustainable\nIrrigation Systems, and will consult ADB on any adjustments of this policy for the\nproject area.\n\nBefore implementation of any market upgrading activities, a market committee for\nthe market concerned will be established and market user fees determined. The\ncomposition  of  the  market  committee,  its  terms  of  office,  and  the  market  user\nfees will need approval from  the Provincial  Rural  Development  Committee.  The\nmarket  committees  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  market  facilities,  and  will\nfinance these activities with market user fees.\n\nB.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n106. Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will be completed:\n\nAFD will have approved the provision of the AFD grant.\n\nThe  Government  will  have  approved  a  Resettlement  Plan,  satisfactory  to  ADB,\nand established the Stung Chinit resettlement subcommittee.\n\nProject  implementation  units  for  each  part  of  the  Project  will  have  been\nestablished and project managers appointed.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n107.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 12,183,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Stung Chinit Irrigation\nand  Rural  Infrastructure  Project,  with  a term  of 32  years,  including a  grace  period  of  8  years,\nand with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n11 August 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\n     President\n\n\f29\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nProject Framework\n\nExternal Assistance for Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment, 1995-1999\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nProject Organization and Coordination \n\nSystem Management Arrangements\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nContract Packages\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nSummary Resettlement Plan\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n30\n\n34\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n46\n\n54\n\n57\n\n1, 3\n\n6, 22\n\n13, 51\n\n15, 58\n\n17, 64\n\n18, 69\n\n19, 72\n\n20, 76\n\n21, 82\n\n23, 89\n\n24, 96\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n\nDetailed Costs Tables and Phasing of Expenditures\n\nDraft Resettlement Plan\n\nSample Constitution and ByLaws for a Water User Group\n\nConsultative Process for System Design\n\nTraining Program for System Management\n\nSelection Criteria for Rural Infrastructure\n\nDetailed Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nProcedure for Establishing Cadastral Map and Land Registration\n\nProject Phasing\n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\nGoals\n\nVerifiable Indicators\n\nMeans of Verification\n\nAssumptions/Risks\n\nReduce poverty through sustained\nsocioeconomic growth in Kompong\nThom Province\n\nIncreased farmer incomes and\neconomic activity in Baray and\nSantuk districts\n\n\u2022 \n\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation\n(BME) surveys, Project\nCompletion Report (PCR)\n\n\u2022  BME surveys, progress reports;\nagronomic observation;

It  identifies\npotential  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  and  recommends  mitigation  and  monitoring\nmeasures during implementation.\n\n2.\nThis SIEE is based on information provided in the final Environmental Impact Assessment\nof  the  Stung  Chinit Water  Resources  Development  Project,1  two  follow-up  fisheries  studies,  field\nvisits,  and  a  detailed  census  of  households  that  may  be  negatively  affected.  It  follows  the  IEE\nprocedures set out in the Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources\nDevelopment  Projects,  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements,  and  Environmental  Review\nProcedures of ADB.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n3.\nThe Project is an integrated rural development project with substantial investments in water\nresources development, rehabilitation of rural roads and markets, training of farmers for long term\nmanagement  of  the  irrigation  scheme  and  development  of  farmer  water  user  groups  to  ensure\nsustainability of the project.\n\nThe  Project  has  a  broad  and  multisectoral  approach  to  stimulate  the  rural  economy  and\n4.\nincludes components for (i) farmer organization, training, and extension services, (ii) rehabilitating\nand  upgrading  irrigation  infrastructure;  (iii)  developing  farmers\u2019  irrigation  management  skills  and\noperation and maintenance (O&M) systems; and (iv) upgrading rural infrastructure such as markets\nand farm-to-market roads.\n\n5.\nThe  Project  will  be  one  of  the  larger  irrigation  development  projects  undertaken  in\nCambodia in recent times.  Monitoring the progress and its implementation will give us information\non the development process, the process of capacity building and training of local staff, monitoring\nthe  effects  of  the  project  on  the  project  area  and  on  the  surrounding  area.  It  will  also  assist  in\nbuilding  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  the\nExecuting Agency, should a second phase be considered.\n\nThe  project  was  initially  assigned  environment  category  A  because  of  the  inclusion  of  a\n\n6.\ndam and reservoir, but was reclassified as category B with the deletion of the dam component.\n\nThe Project covers a gross area  of  about 10,000  hectares  (ha)  in Kompong  Thom,  about\n7.\n150 kilometers (km) north of Phnom Penh on the eastern edge of the Great Lake (Tonle Sap). The\nprovince is one of the poorest in Cambodia and, due to its location on the frontline of an  internal\nsecurity conflict, has missed out on even the modest growth that has occurred in other parts of the\ncountry in the past decade. The province has few natural resources upon which to base economic\nand social development. Much of the population is made up of subsistence or semisubsistence rice\nfarmers,  dependent  on  one  low-yielding  wet  season  rice  crop  per  year,  with  diet  and  income\nsupplemented by capture fisheries and some livestock production. In the wet season, because of\nthe wet climate and low-lying terrain, few  crops other  than  rain-fed  rice can  be grown.  In  the dry\n\n                                               \n1\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment completed in December 1997 was based on the original project concept that\nincluded a storage dam and reservoir in addition to the rehabilitation of the irrigation system.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nseason the situation is even more intractable.  Without irrigation nothing can be grown, and most of\nthe  agricultural  areas  lie  fallow.  Irrigation  can  dramatically  change  the  situation,  by  permitting\nmultiple  rice  crops.  In  addition,  providing  irrigation  opens  the  possibility  of  growing  higher  value\ncrops  and  will  encourage  rice  farmers  to  invest  in  improved  rice  production  technologies.  Thus,\nharnessing the waters of the Stung Chinit and its tributary, the Stung Tang Krasang, will stimulate\nthe rural economy and increase incomes for one of the poorer sections of the country\u2019s population.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nDuring  the  Pol  Pot  regime  in  the  mid-1970s,  many  diversion  weirs,  irrigation  canals,  and\n8.\nwater control structures were built. Many of the structures were poorly planned and designed and\ndid much damage to the rice ecosystem of ancient Cambodia. The structures on the Stung Chinit\nand Stung Tang Krasang are an exception, and functioned for a period from 1978 to 1989, when a\nlarge flood forced the Government to breach the embankment south of the weir to protect it from\ncollapse.\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\n9.\nThe  Stung  Chinit  project  area  is  located  in  the  central  province  of  Kompong  Thom.  The\nproposed  command  area  is  predominantly  a  savanna  floodplain,  comprising  the  northeastern\nfringe of the Tonle Sap floodplain at an altitude of 10-20 meters (m), while the river\u2019s headwaters\nreach altitudes of 100 m. A few scattered hills are found in the catchment area.\n\n10.\nKompong Thom experiences a typical monsoon climate with the major proportion of rainfall\nduring  the  warmer  months  of  May  through  October.  Rainfall  varies  between  1,750  and  2,000\nmillimeters,  the higher figure  attained  in  the  upper  catchment  area.  The  prevailing  pattern  in  the\nStung Chinit area is that the majority of rainfall events are short storms of high intensity lasting from\n1 to 3 hours, which take place over a very small area. The Stung Chinit is one of the tributaries of\nthe  Tonle  Sap  River,  and  has  a  total  catchment  area  of  some  4,2000  square  kilometers  (km2)\n(measured up  to  the Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir).  Downstream  of  the  command  area,  the  Stung\nChinit forms an extensive floodplain-cum-delta system with numerous creeks, braided waterways,\nand permanent waterbodies such as oxbows and  marshes.  The  highest  reported flooding events\nreported  by  farmers  in  the  project  area  occurred  in  1931,  1942,  1944,  1953,  1979,  and  1994.\nLonger  duration  typhoons  during  the  southwest  monsoon  caused  most  of  these  flooding  events\nalthough the largest flood was caused by the northeast monsoon. The 1 in 100 year and the 1 in\n10,000  year  floods  flowing  into  Stung  Chinit  upstream  of  the  Bangki  Tanggren  have  been\nestimated at 2,400 and 10,000 cubic meters/second, respectively.\n\n11.\nIt is estimated that the specific yield of groundwater in the area is small and is assumed to\nrange from 15 to 50 cubic meters (m\u00b3)/day/m. For the area, the yield of the aquifer was calculated\nat 360-800 m\u00b3/day/km\u00b2, depending on the radius of  influence.  A  second estimation  was  made by\nusing  the  water  balance  model  for  the  area,  which  yielded  1.4  million  cubic  meters/year/km\u00b2,\nequivalent to 380 m\u00b3/day/km\u00b2.  Therefore, prospects of  irrigation from  groundwater  resources are\nlimited although it is expected that recharge and yields would increase with the rehabilitation of the\nirrigation system in the area. Many households have private wells, especially along the main road,\nbut few are equipped with pumps. Groundwater-based irrigation during the dry season from high-\nyield wells does not seem to have much scope.\n\nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  Asia\u2019s  largest  freshwater  lake  and  is  of  outstanding  international\n12.\nimportance  for  its  rich  natural  resources.  The  lake  has  been  under  consideration  for  UNESCO\ndesignation as a World Heritage Site. The lake acts as a storage basin\u2014or outlet\u2014for the Mekong\nRiver during the monsoon season. By mid-June, the Mekong water level rises faster than the Tonle\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nSap, the drainage capacity of numerous outlets of the Mekong\u2019s deltaic system to the South China\nSea  cannot  keep  up  with  the  sheer  volume  of  water  flowing  in  the  Mekong  River,  and  water  is\npushed  westward  through  the  120  km  long  Tonle  Sap  River  into  the  lake  and  its  tributaries\n(including  the  Stung  Chinit), thereby  increasing  the  lake  area  sixfold. By  the end  of  October,  the\nflow into Tonle Sap reverses and the lake again drains into the Mekong. The inundated forests of\nthe  floodplains  of  the  Tonle  Sap  serve  as  key  spawning  grounds  and  nursery  for  most  freshwater\nfishes. The high organic content of Tonle Sap\u2019s floodplain further  supports fish expansion and  is  a\nkey factor  in the inherent productivity  of  the  country\u2019s  inland  fisheries.  Over  200  fish  species  have\nbeen  recorded  in  the  Tonle  Sap  area  including  the  giant  Mekong  catfish,  which  weighs  up  to  100\nkilograms.\n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\na.\n\nFlora of Stung Chinit Catchment and Command Area\n\n13.\nPartly because of the long period of political instability and insecurity of the remote forested\nareas, much of the upper reaches of the Stung Chinit have retained their natural forest cover. The\nStung Chinit catchment area comprises one of the last remaining stands of dry evergreen lowland\nforests  in  the  Indo-Chinese  subregion,  which  encompasses  Viet  Nam,  Lao  People's  Democratic\nRepublic, and the eastern parts of Thailand.\n\nMost of the upper catchment area (2,528 km2 or 84 percent) consists of dipterocarp forest.\n14.\nSome  336  km2  (or  11.1  percent)  of  the  Stung  Chinit  catchment  area  constitutes  a  patchwork  of\nforest  of  different  levels  of  disturbance.  Patches  along  the  lower  sections  of  the  Stung  Chinit\ncatchment area have been logged and treated so heavily that few large trees remain. It is assumed\nthat most logging has been carried out by the various communities of the Stung Chinit prior to their\nevacuation in the late 1970s. Some 48 km2 (or 1.6 percent) of the Stung Chinit catchment area is\nmade up of former farmland and landholdings currently in use.\n\nb.\n\nFauna\n\n15.\nCommon wildlife species recorded in the upper catchment area of the Stung Chinit include\npig-tailed  macaque  (Macaque nemestrina),  long-tailed  macaque  (Macaque fascicularis),  and  leaf\nmonkey  (Presbytis cristata).  Mouse  deer  (Tragulus spp.),  civet  and  mongoose  species  (Fam.\nViverridae  and  Herpestidae),  fishing  cat  (Prionailurus viverrinus),  and  wild  boar  (Sus scrofa)  are\nconsidered still common in the upper stretches of the watershed. Otters (Lutra/Lutragale spp.) are\nreported to inhabit the Stung Chinit River and tributaries. In the proposed command area, species\ndiversity has greatly been reduced and only the more common (opportunistic) species still occur in\nsmall  numbers,  like  rodents,  bats,  and  mongooses.  None  of  these  species  are  endemic  to  the\nregion or restricted to the command area.\n\n16.\nStung Chinit is part of the important fishery resource of Tonle Sap. The species diversity of\nthe Tonle Sap and its tributaries is high,  with 215  species  recorded  to date.  Most fish species of\nStung Chinit occur throughout the Mekong\u2019s lower reaches, and Stung Chinit is therefore unlikely\nto hold a large number of endemic species.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Resources\n\nIn 1995 the population of Kompong Thom totaled 542,573. Of these 280,510 were women.\n17.\nThe 1994 population growth rate was estimated at 2.92 percent per year, which would cause the\npopulation  to  double  within  the  next  25  years.  The  province  comprises  an  area  of  13,000  km2,\ndivided into 8 districts, 81 communes, and 720 villages.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nThe number of villages within or near the proposed project area proper is 80. In this area,\n18.\nthere  are  71,609  potential  beneficiaries,  of  which  37,251  are  women  (52  percent).  There  are  an\nestimated 12,500 rural households. The major economic activity of the project area is agriculture,\ncharacterized  primarily  by  paddy  cultivation  during  the  wet  season  and  supplemented  by  the\nproduction  of  livestock  and  an  array  of  fisheries  culture  and  capture  activities.  These  activities\noccur  both  in  the  project  area  itself  and  on  the  nearby  fringes  of  Tonle  Sap.  To  the  east  of  the\nproject  area  some  remaining  forest  areas  also  provide  supplementary  incomes  from  firewood\ngathering, hunting, and collecting wild forest products.\n\n19.\nOver the last two years, four companies have been granted logging concessions covering\n82  percent  of  the  Stung  Chinit  catchment  area.  A  combination  of  stagnant  regional  economic\ngrowth and new logging fees have brought most logging operations to a standstill. On the basis of\na  recent  review  of  concessionaire  performance  conducted  with  assistance  from  ADB,2  the\nGovernment  has  chosen  to  cancel  some  of  the  existing  concessions  and  revise  concession\nagreements to better protect the forest. In the future, logging activities in the upstream catchment\nwill need to be closely monitored.\n\n4.\n\nQuality of Life Values\n\nTo enhance the quality of life for rural Cambodians\u2014who have already suffered from more\n20.\nthan  two  decades  of  civil  war\u2014-it  will  be  necessary  to  move  away  from  subsistence-based\nagriculture. The districts of Baray and Santuk in the command area of the proposed rehabilitation\nproject  contain  a  substantial  number  of  rural  households  that  are  already  involved  in  market-\noriented  forms  of  agricultural  development.  If  these  households  had  access  to  irrigation  water\nduring the dry season and better forms of  water  management during  the  wet  season, they  could\nincrease their household incomes. This will have a multiplier effect for other households, as more\nlocal agricultural wage labor opportunities become available with intensification and diversification\nof local agriculture.\n\n21.\nAlthough provincial statistical data are  generally  considered to be  unreliable,  it  provides  a\nfirst indication of the incidence of waterborne diseases. The most common diseases in  Kompong\nThom are malaria, dengue fever, typhoid, and respiratory infections (including tuberculosis).  Both\ndengue fever and malaria occur in the command area. Malaria is found to occur naturally. Annual\nparasitic incidence (API) is high, with high malaria potential, and moderate to high incidence rates.\nOther  waterborne  diseases  prevalent  in  the  command  area  are  cholera,  gastroenteritis,  and\nhepatitis. Schistosomiasis and filariasis are absent.  Hookworm is prevalent among the population.\n\n22.\nAs the Project will stimulate agricultural development, water resources are likely to become\nexposed  to  more  agricultural  waste  and  pollutants,  as  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are  not\navailable. Polluted water in general could have serious impacts on public  health and  is a  leading\ncause  of  high  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  in  rural  communities.  The  main  sources  for  drinking\nwater  for  the  communities  of  the  command  area  are  rivers  and  private  wells.  The  provincial\nDepartment of Hydrology with assistance from a Christian NGO, Adventist Development and Relief\nAgency (ADRA), has constructed a number of public drinking wells in Kompong Thom.\n\n23.\nUndernutrition  remains  an  issue  for  deprived  communities  far  away  from  Highway  No.  6\nand  who  are  cut  off  from  mainstream  economic  developments.  A  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische\nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) nutrition baseline survey carried out in March/April 1997 in the districts of\n\n                                               \n2 \n\nTA 3152-CAM: Sustainable Forest Management, for $980,000, approved on 31 December 1998.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nStong, Stungsen, and Santuk found a high prevalence of undernutrition (49.3 percent) in children\nunder five years of age, which could be attributed to long-term chronic food shortage.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nMigratory Fish Population\n\n24.\nRehabilitation  of  the  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  and  restoration  of  the  breached\nembankment will negatively impact the migratory fish populations of the Chinit by blocking one of\nthe  migratory  pathways  to  historical  spawning  grounds.  The  Stung  Tang  Krasang  diversion  weir\nhas  blocked  the  main  upstream  wet-season  spawning  migration  in  that  river  ever  since  it  was\nconstructed  in  1978,  although  migration  through  the  Stung  Chinit  and  via  the  main  canal  to  the\nupper  Stung  Tang  Krasang  is  possible  and  documented.  The  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  was\nclosed  almost  continuously  from  1977  to  1989,  and  blocked  fish  migrations  through  the  main\nchannel  during  that  time.  A  migratory  route  was  reestablished  following  the  breaching  of  the\nembankment in 1989 to protect the weir superstructure from further damage. It is not known what\nimpact  the  12-year  weir  closure  had  on  migratory  fish  populations,  but  anecdotal  evidence  and\nobservation suggest that a significant migration still takes place in the Chinit today.\n\n25.\nThe most promising mitigation measure for the migratory fish population is to install a fish\npass on the Stung Chinit diversion weir during the rehabilitation phase of the Project. The current\nstructure at the weir includes a navigation lock on which a fish pass can be constructed.  With the\ncorrect design, this will permit a share of the migratory fish populations to pass the weir and give\nthem access to historical spawning grounds in the upstream areas of the Stung Chinit and Stung\nTang  Krasang.  Due  to  the  superstructure  design,  a  fish  pass  is  considered  less  likely  to  be\nsuccessful at the  Stung  Tang Krasang  diversion  weir, and  the  one  at  the  Stung  Chinit  Diversion\nWeir  will  serve  both  river  systems.  This  is  borne  out  by  the  current  situation  \u2013  the  Stung  Tang\nKrasang  weir  is  jammed  shut, but fish  are  migrating  above  the  weir  through  the  main  canal  that\nconnects  both  rivers.  If the  fish  pass  at  the  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  does  operate  effectively,\nand future monitoring suggests that the Stung Tang Krasang would benefit from its own fish pass\nat the weir, one can be designed at a later stage based on the results of the Stung Chinit model.\n\nThe recommended design will be based on an existing model at the Ben Anderson Barrage\n26.\non the Burnett River, Australia. Without detailed knowledge of operational water levels above and\nbelow the Chinit diversion, the  length of the  structure, and hence the  number  of  cells,  cannot be\nestimated  until  the detailed design  stage.  Because the fish pass  will  be  the first  of  its  kind  to  be\nbuilt in Southeast Asia, there exists an excellent opportunity to carry out original research that may\nbe of tremendous value to other projects in the future. A research proposal for the fish pass at the\nStung  Chinit  diversion  weir  is  included  as  a  supplementary  appendix.  The  Mekong  River\nCommission and the Cambodian Department of Fisheries will collaborate with  the  Project on  this\nresearch component.\n\n2.\n\nMinimum Dry Season Flow\n\nTo maintain the full health and integrity of downstream aquatic habitats, the  entire  normal\n27.\ndry-season flow is required. Clearly, this will not be available. Fish and many other forms of aquatic\nlife are at  their  most  vulnerable  during  the dry-season  months  because  environmental  conditions\nare  usually  most  harsh  during  this  period.  Food  is  often  scarce,  levels  of  predation  are  highest,\nwater temperatures usually peak during the hot season and, subsequently, oxygen often falls to its\nlowest level. All these factors stress fish, rendering them susceptible to disease and mortality.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\n28.\nIn the absence of quantitative studies, minimum environmental flow releases of at least 10\npercent of the mean monthly flow have been recommended to maintain healthy aquatic habitats in\nEurope,  North  America,  and  Australia.  Given  the  diverse  nature  of  tropical  fish  faunas,  and  the\ngenerally  higher  water  temperatures,  the  figure  10  percent  of  mean  monthly  flow  may  not  be\nsufficient  for  the  Stung  Chinit.  But  much  of  the  water  diverted  from  the  river  channel  will  be\ndistributed into the same area through paddy, secondary and tertiary canals, and drains, and some\nwill return to the river course through this system. The species of fish common to the area do not\nnaturally spend most of their lifetime in the river system, but rather move throughout the landscape\nwhere  water  is  available.  Farmers  interviewed  during  the  feasibility  study  noted  that  paddy  fish\nyields improved when the system was functioning in the 1980s.\n\n29.\nEvery  attempt  should  be  made  to  gather  pre-impoundment  data  on  physical  and\nhydrological characteristics below the weir during the design phase of the Project, and to maintain\nthese as much as possible without unduly compromising the irrigation function of the weir. These\nactivities are included in the fisheries research component described in a supplementary appendix.\n\n3.\n\nIncreased Use of Agrochemicals\n\n30. With  the  increase  in  rice  and/or  other  cash  crop  cultivation,  use  of  agrochemicals  will\nincrease and may create problems related to residual toxicity and nutrient enrichment of  water  in\nthe command area. Use of pesticides in the area is currently negligible except for farmers growing\ncash  crops  in  the  dry  season.  But  through  the  drainage  system  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation\nsystem, chemicals could affect wetlands surrounding the villages up  to  the ecologically  important\nTonle Sap and floodplain. Although there is a time lag between the beginning of irrigation and the\nobservance of water quality deterioration (increased pollutants), the agricultural effects are already\nbeing  observed  for  such  aspects  as  nitrates  as  water  hyacinth  is  already  seen  in  the  command\narea.  Lab  facilities  to  analyze  pesticides  residues  in  water  samples  are  not  yet  available  in\nCambodia, but analyses could be carried out in neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand  and  Viet\nNam.\n\nA  recent  study3  showed  that  most  pesticides  available  in  Cambodia  are  of  questionable\n31.\nquality. Most pesticides are not labeled in Khmer and sellers and farmers have no way of knowing\nthe  expiry  date  of  most  of  the  available  pesticides.  Two  popular  pesticides  sold  and  used\u2014\nmevinphos  and  methyl-parathion\u2014are  in  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  Hazard  Class  I,\ni.e., the  most  toxic  of pesticides.  In  October 1998,  the  Cambodian  Government passed  the  Sub-\ndecree  of  Standard  Agricultural  Materials  and  Equipment  Management,  a  law  that  includes\npesticide regulation. This is the first law to deal with pesticides in Cambodia. It regulates the import,\nsale,  labeling,  packaging,  quality,  storage,  disposal,  and  marketing  of  pesticides  in  Cambodia.\nSince the passage of the legislation, however, not much has been done to implement it.\n\nThe lethal effects of pesticides are rarely restricted to the species for which the chemical is\n32.\napplied.  Most  have  a  broad-spectrum  impact  that  causes  incidental  damage  to  a  wide  array  of\nwildlife, plant life, and water organisms. Pesticides also represent a major occupational health risk\nfor farmers and their families.  A WHO report (1990) revealed that occupational pesticide poisoning\nmay affect some 3 percent of the farmers in developing countries every year. Accurate data for the\ncommand  area  is  not  available.  Medical  staffs  in  Baray  and  Santuk  Districts  are  not  trained  in\nidentifying  or  treating  pesticides  poisoning  cases,  and  lack  diagnostic  equipment  and  antidotes.\nPesticide-related  health  problems  stem  largely  from  improper  handling,  application  (mixing  and\nspraying  chemical  cocktails),  and  storage  practices.  WHO  strongly  recommends  that  Category  I\npesticides should  be used  only by  trained personnel.  Field  surveys for  this assessment  revealed\n\n                                               \n3\n\nJahn, G. 1999. The Cambodia-IRRI-Australia Project 1998 Annual Technical Report (CIAP).\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\nthat the present use of pesticides is limited to periods when pest outbreaks occur. This may reflect\nthe  poor  socioeconomic  conditions  prevailing  rather  than  the  seriousness  of  pest  attacks.  Many\nfarmers  do  not  strictly  follow  the  application  prescriptions,  spraying  either  less  than  prescribed\ndoses  (to  reduce  cost)  or  up  to  2  times  higher  during  pest  outbreaks.  Most  farmers  do  not  use\nsprayers, but flick the pesticide over their fields using bamboo brushes.\n\n33.\nExcessive  use  of  chemical  fertilizers  will  result  in  enrichment  of  water  bodies  due  to\nnitrogen and phosphorus runoff. Loading of water bodies (rivers, oxbows, ponds, and marshes) by\nthese  chemicals  could  cause  eutrophication,  which  in  turn  will  give  rise  to  prolific  aquatic  plant\ngrowth, especially of algae. Aquatic  weed  growth  can  cause  a  drop  in  dissolved  oxygen  content\nand impact aquatic life, including fish.\n\n34.\nTo mitigate the impact of increased agrochemical use, the Project will develop farm safety\ntraining  programs  on  integrated  pest  management  (IPM)  as  part  of  the  agriculture  extension\nservices envisioned for  the  project,  and  through farmer field schools  modules on  the  appropriate\nuse of pesticides and fertilizers.\n\n35.\nAnother  mitigation  measure  is  to develop  and  implement  systematic  monitoring  programs\nfor  agrochemicals  residues  in  wetland  ecosystems  and  poisoning  cases.  Water  quality  at\nappropriately  chosen  sites  will  be  monitored  to  measure  changes  in  physicochemical  levels,\nincluding buildup of pesticides residues. The Mekong River Commission will undertake this work on\nbehalf  of  MOWRAM  and  prepare  annual  reports  that  identify  negative  impacts  and  recommend\nmeasures  for  water  quality  improvement.  Future  water  quality  standards  for  various  uses,  as\ndefined by the Ministry of Environment should be adhered to.\n\n4.\n\nIncrease in Hookworm Incidence\n\n36. With  the  irrigation  project,  more  standing  water  will  be  available  and  for  longer  periods\nduring  the  year.  There  is  a  possibility  of  increased  incidences  of  hookworm  in  the  population\nserved by the Project. Hookworms cause chronic blood loss from the intestine and predisposes the\nvictim to the development of iron deficiency anemia, sometimes of great severity, which constitutes\na  major  public  health  problem.  Their  harmful  effects  are  often  aggravated  by  coexistent\nmalnutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. The presence of hookworms reduces the productivity of\nthe population.\n\n37.\nAccording to the WHO office in Phnom Penh, a simple dose of mebendazol tablet will not\nonly have a significant impact on the overall health of the population but also improve their overall\nproductivity.  Given  the  low  cost  of  the  tablet,  $0.02  each,  distribution  of  this  medication  is  well\nwithin the means of a host of nongovernment organizations and international organizations that are\nfocusing on health issues in Cambodia. In the farmer field schools and during extension activities,\nthe  Project  should  ensure  that  farmers  are  educated  on  the  health  risks  of  hookworm  and  seek\npartner organizations to provide mebendazol in the project area.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Mechanism\n\n38.\nThe  potential  impacts  described  above  require  careful  monitoring  of  water  quality  and\nfisheries  health.  MOWRAM  does  not  presently  have  the  capacity  to  undertake  such  research.\nInstead the Mekong River Commission together with the Department of Fisheries will implement a\nmonitoring program that includes annual water quality testing and periodic fish stock and migration\nassessments.  The  work  will  begin  with  establishment  of  environmental  baseline  data  on  water\nquality  and  annual  fish  migrations,  and  then  use  repeat  samplings  over  the  life  of  the  Project  to\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 9, page 8\n\ndetermine  Project  impacts  as  early  as  possible.  Annual  research  reports  will  highlight  problem\nareas and recommend further mitigation measures as necessary.\n\nF. \n\nConclusions\n\nThe Project is expected to improve the quality of life for the population served by increasing\n39.\ntheir  income  and  providing  better  food  security.  With  the  mitigation  measures  as  recommended,\nthe Project would have no significant adverse environmental impact.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nThis summary draws on the draft Resettlement Plan (RP) prepared by the Government with\nassistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  RP  was  developed  from  preliminary\ndesigns, and will need to be updated during the detailed design phase in the early stages of project\nimplementation  to  ensure  that  all  negatively  affected  persons  (APs)  are  accounted  for  and\ncompensated  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements.  A  loan  covenant  makes  commencement  of\ncivil works conditional on satisfactory updating of the RP.\n\nB.\n\nNegative Impacts\n\nThe main components of the project that will result in land acquisition are reconstruction of\n2.\nweirs  that  will  increase  flood-prone  areas,  renovation  of  canal  banks,  and  rehabilitation  of\nsecondary canals and drains that have fallen into disrepair.\n\n1.\n\nResidential Structures\n\n3.\nTwenty-two  households  (86  APs)  residing  on  the  main  canal  bank  will  be  required  to\nrelocate. The houses are made of bamboo and thatch. The primary economic occupation of these\nhouseholds  is  collection  of  bamboo  from  upstream  areas  and  sale  of  bamboo  products,  and\nfishing.  These  households  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  an area  close  to  the  Stung  Chinit  river  to\nprotect their sources of livelihood.\n\n2.\n\nLoss of Productive Land\n\n4.\nIt  is  expected  that  water  impounded  by  the  restored  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  will\ninundate  some  lands  upriver  that  are  currently  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  According  to  a\ncensus of the area completed during preparation of the RP, some of the 70 households in village\nTaphok may be affected by loss of land in the flood-prone  area. A preliminary hydrological  study\nindicates that at maximum flood, some 110 hectares (ha) would be inundated temporarily, and up\nto 30 ha permanently. This area was inundated seasonally from 1977 to 1989, when the irrigation\nsystem still functioned. The collapse of the system permitted local households to expand recession\nrice to some areas closer to the river bottom. Interviews with farmers indicate that when the system\nwas functioning, it was still possible to plant rice in much of the inundated area because the water\nlevel  was  30  centimeters  or  less.  The exact nature of the  impact  cannot  be  determined  until  the\ndetailed  design  phase  of  the  Project,  but  it  is  encouraging  that  Taphok  remained  in  its  current\nlocation  throughout  the  period  when  the  scheme  functioned,  and  supported  roughly  the  same\nnumber of families.\n\n5.\nDuring restoration of the secondary canals and drains, some households may lose narrow\nstrips  of  agricultural  land  along  canal  alignments.  Focus  group  discussions  and  consultations\nindicated that households are willing to give up to 2-meter strips of land voluntarily.  Furthermore,\nhouseholds  with  lands  along  the  canals  are  expected  to  be  the  major  project  beneficiaries.  The\nproject design also requires that two thirds of the farmers agree on the design for secondary canals\nprior to commencement of civil works.\n\nC.\n\nConsultations, Census, and Baseline Survey\n\n6.\nDuring preparation of the RP, focus discussions with potential APs were conducted in five\nvillages  to  inform  stakeholders  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives  and  likely  impacts.  Following  focus\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\ndiscussions,  the  village  leaders  participated  in  an  information  campaign  to  describe  the  planned\ncensus and baseline survey and inform the target villages of the schedule for consultations. During\nthe  survey, APs  were given detailed  information on  the Project,  the  objectives of  the  survey,  the\ngeneral provisions of ADB\u2019s resettlement policy, and resettlement/compensation options. Based on\nthe preliminary design, the census and social survey covered 91 percent of affected households.\nExcept for  the  22 families  residing  on  the  canal banks, all  other families  are  engaged  in  farming\nactivities. Secondary occupations are fishing and wage labor. Thirty-six households surveyed earn\nless  than  KR50,000  and  are  below  the  poverty  line.  The  balance  earn  between  KR50,000  and\nKR100,000, and only 2 households earn more than this in a year. The majority of the households\nhave only verbal permission to cultivate the land, and although no formal titles exist for the land in\nthe area, the Government claims right of ownership. The Government  recognizes that  regardless\nof legal status, negatively affected farmers are entitled to compensation.\n\nD.\n\nUpdating and Revisions in the RP\n\n7.\nDuring the design phase of  the Project,  technical  specifications for the  diversion  weir and\nmain  canal  and  detailed  hydrological  investigations  will  permit  a  more  accurate  estimate  of\ninundated areas and APs upstream of the weir. At this stage it will also be possible to determine if\nany  secondary  canal  or  drain  restoration  will  result  in  further  APs.  Thus  at  the  end  of  2001,  the\nGovernment  will  review  the original  census  data, update  information  on  land  use by  the  affected\nhouseholds,  and  identify  any  other  households  further  upstream  that  may  be  affected.  The\nGovernment will submit the revised and updated RP to ADB for approval prior to commencement\nof civil works.\n\nE.\n\nLegal and Policy Framework\n\nAt  present there  is no  legally documented  resettlement policy  in  Cambodia.  Resettlement\n\n8.\nwill be guided by ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).\n\nF.\n\nEntitlements\n\n9.\nAttempts  will  be  made  during  the  detailed  design  to  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  social\nimpacts.  Vulnerable  groups  will  be  given  special  assistance  to  deal  with  adverse  impacts  and\nassisted  to  benefit  from  the  project,  by  participating  in  small  civil  works.  The  UN  World  Food\nProgramme  will  participate  to  target  vulnerable  groups  and  provide  rice  and  cash  payments  for\npiecework. Farming households will be entitled to participate in the agricultural extension services\npackage under the Project. Severely affected vulnerable households will be entitled to agriculture\ninputs to the value of $200 per household.\n\n10.\nCompensation  will  be  at  replacement  value  for  lost  assets.  Transportation  and  a\nsubsistence allowance will be paid to cover for any loss of income during the resettling  period.  A\ntransport  allowance  of  a  maximum  estimated  $40  per  household  or  assistance  in  kind  would  be\nprovided.  The  subsistence  allowance  is  estimated  at  $50  per  household.  Loss  of  land  will  be\ncompensated with similar productive land, if available, or compensated at market prices, currently\nestimated  at  $2,000/ha.  All  unit  prices  for  compensation  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  prior  to\npayment of compensation.\n\n11.\nThe  cost  of  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  is  estimated  at  about  $370,000\nequivalent. This includes contingencies for up to 75 additional households and 80 ha of land in the\nevent that more APs are identified based on detailed design.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Arrangements and Grievance Redress\n\n12.\nThe Government has established an Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) chaired\nby the Ministry of Economy and Finance to take overall responsibility for resettlement in aid-funded\nprojects.  To  handle  day-to-day  implementation  matters,  IRC  will  establish  the  Stung  Chinit\nResettlement Subcommittee (SCRS) that will include the governor or deputy governor of Kompong\nThom Province, an appointed IRC member, representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources\nand Meteorology Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and other relevant provincial departments and\nat least four representatives of the APs. AP representation may be revised upward once the total\nnumber  of  APs  is  finalized  during  detailed  design.  Stakeholder  monitoring  groups  will  be\nestablished at the village level.\n\n13.\nA  grievance  committee  will  be  established  within  the  SCRS  and  will  include  AP\nrepresentatives  as  well  as  representatives  from  an  independent  nongovernment  organization\nengaged to monitor RP implementation (see below). Members of the PIU will be assigned to assist\nthe SCRS on the technical aspects of resettlement arising from planned civil works, scheduling of\nactivities, and coordination.\n\nH.\n\nIndependent Monitoring\n\nIRC will engage an independent agency to carry out monitoring and evaluation of the RP.\n14.\nThe  objectives  and  the  terms  of  reference  will  be  prepared  by  IRC  and  reviewed  by  ADB.  AP\nrepresentatives  will  work  with  the  independent  agency  to  ensure  participatory  monitoring.\nGrievance  may  also  be  expressed  to  the  independent  agency  and  the  concerns  raised  will  be\nincluded in the monitoring report. The agency will submit quarterly reports to IRC and ADB directly.\nSix  months  after  the  completion  of  resettlement  activities,  the  monitoring  agency  will  submit  an\nevaluation report to ADB and IRC.\n\nI.\n\nImplementation schedule\n\n15.\nResettlement activities will commence at the earliest in year 2002. Once the detailed design\nis complete and a revised plan is submitted, IRC will provide an updated implementation schedule\nthat indicates resettlement activities as they relate to the civil works.\n\n\f 57\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Stung Chinit irrigation system was built in the late 1970s by the Khmer Rouge regime\n1.\nusing largely forced labor. The system was designed to provide supplemental wet season irrigation\nover the maximum possible command area of 12,000 hectares (ha) using run-of-the-river flows, but\nwith little regard for economic viability. Although there are few records, local farmers recall that the\nscheme  operated  more  or  less  continuously  until  the  late  1980s,  when  the  main  canal  was\nintentionally breached to protect  the Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  during  a  major flood. Since  then\nmany of the canals have silted up, none of the major control structures are functioning, and service\nroads  are  largely  impassable  in  the  wet  season.  Agriculture  continues  in  the  area,  but  at  a  low\nintensity.  Farmers  rely  on  one  rain-fed  rice  crop  per  year,  fisheries  associated  with  wet  season\npaddy, and livestock including some cattle, pigs, chickens, and ducks.\n\n2.\nThe first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted feasibility study to assess  development\noptions  for  the  Stung  Chinit,  conducted  in  1997,  concluded  that  maximum  benefits  would  be\nobtained by the construction of a dam upstream that would allow year-round irrigation over the full\n12,000  ha  command  area.  However,  the  Government  and  ADB  subsequently  agreed  that\nproceeding  with  the  full  dam  option  would  be  too  ambitious  at  this  stage,  in  view  of  the\nGovernment's limited implementation capacity, farmers\u2019 lack  of  experience  with fully  irrigated  rice\nproduction, and uncertainty about environmental impacts. It was therefore agreed that a two-stage\napproach should be adopted in developing the area. The first stage will be limited to areas close to\nthe  main  canal  that  can  be  irrigated  using  run-of-the-river  flows.  A  subsequent  feasibility  study\nestimated  these  areas  at  7,000  ha,  comprising  5,000  ha  to  receive  supplemental  wet  season\nirrigation and 2,000 ha to receive year-round irrigation.\n\nIrrigation,  though  crucial,  is  but  one  of  many  constraints  to  agricultural  productivity.\n3.\nCambodia  in  general  and  the  project  area  in  particular,  also  suffer  from  extremely  poor\ntransportation  links,  lack  of  knowledge  about  preharvest  and  postharvest  improved  agricultural\ntechniques  and  technology,  and  inadequate  marketing  links.  For  these  reasons,  the  Project\nincludes substantial investments in rural  roads, agricultural extension  services,  and  markets.  The\nProject  also  provides  Government  staff  with  training  in  irrigation  design,  construction  and\nmanagement, as  well as agronomy,  to  ensure  transfer  of  technology  and know-how.  Because  of\nthe  important  role  to  be played by farmers  in  regular operation and  maintenance of  the  scheme,\nand current lack of experience in cooperative water resource management, substantial resources\nare allocated for farmer mobilization and training.\n\n4.\nIn combination, these investments are expected to increase agricultural productivity, reduce\nfarming costs, and  stimulate  the  rural  economy.  It  is  probable that  during  project  implementation\nthe  opportunity  will  be  taken  to  use  skills  developed  therein  to  improve  the  operation  of  other\nirrigation schemes elsewhere in Kompong Thom Province or nearby provinces.  However, benefits\nresulting  from  the  improved  operation  of  these  schemes  were  not  included  in  this  economic\nanalysis.\n\nB. \n\nAssumptions on Project Costs\n\nThe costs were prepared according  to  standard  ADB  guidelines  using  COSTAB software.\n5.\nThe costs were based either on local prices prevailing in the project area in late 1999 or in dollar\nterms inflated from previous studies at a rate of 3 percent per year.  An exchange rate of KR3,800\nper dollar was used where applicable. Physical contingencies were estimated for  individual  items\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nat rates shown in the detailed cost tables. Physical contingencies are based on Mission estimates,\nthe Cambodian Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (RIIP),1 and the recent International Fund\nfor  Agricultural  Development  appraisal  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila\n(foundation  stone)  Project.  International  price  contingencies  were  calculated  according  to  ADB\u2019s\nestimates  of  international  price  inflation,  currently  2.4  percent  per  year.  Local  inflation  had  been\nrunning at rates of up to 18 percent  annually  in  recent  years  but, as  a  result  of  political  changes\nand improved economic policies, fell to about 4 percent by the end of 1999. An inflation rate of 6\npercent  was applied  to  local  costs, as  specified  in  the  ADB  guidelines for  Cambodia.  Taxes  and\nduties have been applied at rates supplied by the Cambodian Ministry of Finance.\n\nC.\n\nExpected Impact of the Main Components\n\n1. \n\nIrrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\n\na. \n\nAgriculture\n\nThe  proposed  project  area  totals  about  7,000  ha  that,  following  the  collapse  or  de-\n6.\ncommissioning of the irrigation system structures, is currently cropped with only wet  season  rain-\nfed rice. The exact extent of the cropped area will be established during the detailed design phase.\nYields are currently low by international standards at 1.2\u20131.4 tons per hectare  (t/ha).  Without  the\nProject, per hectare yields are expected to rise from an average of 1.3 to 2.3 t/ha over a 20-year\nperiod as a result of the gradual adoption of improved technologies\u2014which is already taking place\nin  Cambodia\u2014and  improved  marketing  and  road  communication  in  the  Kompong  Thom  area,\nwhich until recently has been virtually inaccessible.\n\n7.\nWith  the  Project,  assuring  supplies  of  supplementary  irrigation  water  and  introduction  of\nimproved  technologies  are  expected  to  raise  wet  season yields from  the  initial  1.3  t/ha up to  3.0\nt/ha, generally exceeding the without-project situation by 0.7 t/ha.  It is anticipated that the 7,000 ha\nwill be improved over a period of three years by 2,000, 2,000, and 3,000 ha per year, and with the\nfirst  significant  increase  in  yield  occurring  in  the  year  2005.    Furthermore,  and  based  on  recent\nexperiences  in  other  improved  irrigation  schemes  in  Cambodia,  the  provision  of  supplementary\nirrigation  in  the  wet  season  together  with  agricultural  extension  and  improved  rice  varieties  will\nallow about 40 percent of farmers to double-crop their  land, growing one  short-duration  rice  crop\nfollowed by another longer duration crop.\n\nThe  rehabilitation  of  the  weirs  and  associated  irrigation  works  will  also  allow  the  reliable\n8.\nirrigation of about 2,000 ha in the dry season. Production on this land in the dry season is currently\nnegligible and will remain so in the without-project situation. With irrigation, yields on this area are\nexpected to  increase over  a four-year period from  2.5 to 4.0  t/ha,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  it  will\ntake  two  years  to  bring  the  full  area  into  production.  Again  following  the  experience  of  other\nimproved  irrigation  schemes  in  Cambodia,  farmers  are  expected  to  diversify  away  from  rice\nproduction into other cash crops on about 25 percent of the dry season irrigated area of 2,000 ha.\nThe cropping intensity on the balance of the 1,500 ha, which is solely planted to rice, is expected to\naverage 90 percent in the dry season.\n\n9.\nThe difference between the with- and without-project situations is expected to stabilize after\n20 years, after which time yields will have reached their steady-state levels. In total, the Project is\nexpected to lead to a  sustainable  increase  in  rice  production  of  about 16,300 t  of  rice and about\n950 t of other crops per year.\n\n                                               \n1 \n\nLoan 1385-CAM: Rural Infrastructure Improvement, for $25.1 million, approved on 28 September 1995.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nb.\n\nFisheries\n\n10.\nFish production in paddy fields is already a common practice in the project area, but yields\nare limited by the occurrence of drought periods during the wet season. During the socio-economic\ninvestigations undertaken as part of the project preparatory technical assistance, farmers reacted\npositively  to  the  idea  of  supplementary  irrigation,  especially  since  it  would  make  their  fish\nproduction  more  reliable  and  profitable.  However,  fish  production  on  irrigated  land  in  the  dry\nseason  is  a  more  problematic  concept  in  that  the  proposed  high-yielding  varieties  require\napplications  of  pesticides,  which  may  reduce  paddy  fish  productivity.  On  average,  and  after\ndiscussions with local farmers, the increase in fish production resulting from the rehabilitation of the\nirrigation scheme was estimated at about 15 kg per ha per year, valued at about KR5,000 per kg,\nor a total of about $20 per ha per year over the 7,000 ha. These benefits will accrue as each wet\nseason block is sequentially rehabilitated.\n\n2.\n\nRural Infrastructure (Part B)\n\nADB  has  established  through  a  number  of  projects,  especially  in  Bangladesh2  and\n11.\nCambodia (the RIIP), that the provision or improvement of rural roads and markets leads to definite\nand  sustainable  benefits.  These  include  lower  transport  costs,  enhanced  access  to  agricultural\nextension, health and education services, lower prices for purchases and higher prices for sales of\nproduce, improved access to agricultural inputs, the opportunity to diversify into higher value crops\nsuch as  vegetables,  increased  availability  of  raw  materials  for  nonagricultural  industries,  a  wider\nmarket  for  crops  and  other  locally  produced  goods,  reduced  levels  of  spoilage,  and  increased\neconomic  opportunities  such  as  repair  shops,  roadside  cafes,  and  fuel  sales  associated  with\nimprovements in transport. A further direct benefit is the employment created by the use of labor-\nintensive construction technology \u2013 completing 1 km of road is estimated to generate about 2,000\ndays of employment.\n\n12.\nBecause  some  of  the  preceding  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify  or  forecast,  ADB  has\nadopted  two  conservative  methods  of  assessing  benefits:  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings\nand  the  stimulation  of  agricultural  producer  surpluses  (APS).  VOC  savings  result  from  the  direct\nreduction in costs as a result of less wear and tear on vehicles following an improvement in road\nsurface conditions, a drop in prices charged when vehicle utilization  rates  can be  increased as  a\nresult  of  a  reduction  in  journey  times,  and  changes  to  less  expensive  modes  of  transport.  APS\nbenefits  result  from  the  removal  of  physical  constraints  to  the  transport  of  bulky  items  such  as\nfertilizer,  improved  seed  and  surplus  crop  production  as  well  as  from  crop  diversification.  The\ncalculation of the benefits accruing to the 150 km of roads to be rehabilitated under the Project is\ndiscussed below.\n\n13.\nDirect benefits have not been attributed to the associated refurbishing of six rural markets\nsince these benefits are difficult to quantify precisely. However, the consultants  implementing  the\nRIIP  derived  an  estimate3  of  postharvest  quality  improvements  resulting  from  better  market\nfacilities  valued  at  2-5  percent  of  the  value  of  the  crop.  The  average  agricultural  turnover  of  12\nmarkets investigated by the consultants was about $685,000.\n\n                                               \n2 \n3 \n\nFor example, see PCR: BAN 21086: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, June 1999.\nI.T.  Transport  Ltd.  2000.  Market Rehabilitation Sub-Projects: Screening, Selection and Appraisal.  Phnom  Penh,\nFebruary 2000.\n\n\f  60\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\na.\n\nVOC Benefits\n\n14.\nThe RIIP based its estimates of VOC savings on a study undertaken on stretches of roads\nrehabilitated by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Battambang Province. Battambang\nis more remote and less developed than Kompong Thom. The project area is directly adjacent to a\nrecently renovated national highway, and is only two hours from  Phnom  Penh, therefore  this  ILO\nestimate  is  inherently  conservative.  The  costs  were  inflated by  20  percent,  using  the  increase  in\nthe price of labor from KR2,500 per day to KR3,000 per day from the time of the survey until now\nas a proxy for the general increase in costs.\n\n15.\nAccording to the survey estimate, before roads were rehabilitated an average of about 780\nvehicles of various types, mostly bicycles or motorcycles, traveled along a typical kilometer length\nat  a  weighted  average  VOC  of  KR210  per  vehicle  per  kilometer.  After  rehabilitation,  the  traffic\ncount rapidly increased to about 1,400 vehicles per day, at an average VOC of KR150 per vehicle\nper  kilometer.  The  economic  analysis  does  not  include  cost  savings  for  incremental  traffic\ngenerated by road rehabilitation, to avoid double counting of benefits attributed to APS (paras. 16-\n18).  Thus,  the  VOC  saving  can  be  estimated  at  600X(210-150)  =  KR36,000  or  about  $9.45  per\nkilometer per day.  This equates to a total VOC saving of US$ 3,356 per kilometer per year. As in\nthe RIIP, it was assumed that these savings will take two years to reach their full levels.\n\nb. \n\nAPS Benefits\n\n16.\nPrevious ADB studies have referred to research work in Bangladesh and elsewhere, which\ndemonstrated  that  improving  rural  roads  stimulates  agricultural  production  on  each  side  of  the\nrehabilitated road and generates APS. The width of the corridor is generally at least 2 km on each\nside  of  the  road.  About  150  km  of  road  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the  proposed  component,  of\nwhich about 50 km pass directly through the Stung Chinit irrigation scheme. No APS benefits have\nbeen attributed  directly  to  those  50  km of  road  since  increased  production along and near  these\nroads has been assumed to come from the rehabilitation of the irrigation scheme and the provision\nof irrigation water.\n\nOf  the  remaining  100  km,  about  80  percent  is  assumed  to  pass  through  productive\n17.\nagricultural  areas,  the  remainder  being  occupied  by  villages  and  fishponds  or  is  used  for  other\npurposes  or  is  idle.  The  net  length  of  road  for  which  APS  benefits  can  be  claimed  and  the\nassociated benefit corridor are presented in Table A11.1.\n\nTable A11.1: Road Lengths and Corridors for APS Benefits\n\nYear\n\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n\nNet Road Length\n(km)\n10\n 30\n30\n10\n\nBenefit Corridor\n(ha)\n4,000\n12,000\n12,000\n4,000\n\nAPS = agricultural producer surplus.\n\n18.\nIt was noted above that, even without the Project,  per hectare  yields  are  expected  to  rise\nfrom 1.3 to 2.3 t/ha over the 7,000 ha over a 20-year period as a result of the gradual adoption of\nimproved  technologies  and  improved  marketing  and  road  communication.  The  APS  impact  of\nimproving  roads  under  the  rural  infrastructure  component  has  been  assumed  to  speed  up  this\nprocess by about five years over the amount of time that it would otherwise have taken. Thus, in\n\n\f 61\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nthe  calculation  of  APS  benefits  the  without-Project  increase  in  per  hectare  gross  margins  is\naccelerated by five years and multiplied by the area of the benefit corridor.\n\nC.\n\nFinancial Farm Analyses\n\n19.\nFour simplified farm models were prepared to assess the Project impact on a typical farm\nfamily  in  the  area.  The  average  farm  size  was  1  ha.  No  account  was  taken  of  changes  in  the\nproduction  of  other  crops  within  the  homestead  plot,  of  fish  production,  or  of  other  off-farm\nincomes, since it had been  assumed  that  those enterprises  would not  be  directly affected by  the\nProject. The four models refer to\n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe present without-Project situation;\nthe future without-Project situation in the year 2020;\nthe  future  with-Project  situation  in  the  year  2020  on  the  7,000  ha  provided  with\nsupplementary irrigation in the wet season; and\nthe future with-Project situation in the year 2020 on the 2,000 ha provided with irrigation\nwater in the dry season.\n\n20.\nThe calculated financial gross margins per hectare in the various situations, based on  the\nprice of rice in the project area, about KR450 per kg or $118 per mt, are presented in Table A11.2.\n\nTable A11.2: Gross Margins\n($)\n\nSituation\n\nWithout Project \u2013 2001\nWithout Project \u2013 2020\nWet Season Irrigation \u2013 2020\nDry Season Irrigation \u2013 2020\nBoth Wet Season and Dry Season \u2013 2020\n\nGross Margin\n(per hectare)\n114\n153\n237\n266\n503\n\nGross Margin\n(per family\nperson-day)\n\n0.95\n1.28\n1.98\n2.21\n2.10\n\nBy  the  year  2020,  the  provision  of  supplementary  wet  season  irrigation  should  raise  the\n21.\naverage  family\u2019s  income  by  a  minimum  of  $84  per  year,  earning  an  additional  $0.70  per  family\nperson-day.  Dry season irrigation only would raise it by $113 per year or $0.93 per family person-\nday. Those families cropping  in  both  wet  and dry  seasons  could expect  an  increase  of  $350 per\nyear, or $0.82 per family person-day.  This analysis  assumes  quite  slow adoption  of  technologies\nand  techniques  to  improve  yields.  A  parallel  study  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement\nestimated  annual  incremental  household  returns  to  cropping  in  the  wet  and  dry  season  at  $236.\nThe  analysis  assumed  lower  cropping  intensities,  and  assumed  these  benefits  are  available  by\nyear 6 of the Project. The use of irrigation to allow cropping in both the wet and dry seasons is thus\nan effective way of sustainably and significantly raising family incomes. The analysis is inherently\nconservative  because  it  does  not  attempt  to  capture  the  impact  of  improved  post-harvesting\npractices  on  rice  quality  and  price,  though  provision  is  made  for  training  in  this  area  as  part  of\nagricultural extension services under Part A.\n\n\f 62\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\nD.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe economic analysis was carried out separately for both of the major components and for\n22.\nthe Project as a whole in accordance with standard ADB procedures. Economic prices for the main\ntraded inputs and outputs, which are mainly rice and fertilizer, are based on the latest World Bank\ncommodity  price  projections  for  the  year  2005,  adjusted  to  constant  1999  values  using  the  G-5\nmanufacturers'  unit  value  index.  Rice  is freely  traded from  Cambodia  across  the  borders  to  both\nThailand and Viet  Nam and  in  both  directions  depending  on  the  time  of  year.  Rice  is  commonly\nexported  from  Cambodia  after  the  wet  season  harvest  as  farmers  have  to  accept  low  prices  to\nclear  their  debts  and  to  purchase  various  goods,  but  rice  is  later  imported  again  to  Cambodia\nduring the lean period before the next harvest. The price used in the analyses is thus the arithmetic\naverage  of  the  import-  and  export-parity  prices.  This  situation  is  expected  to  continue  in  the\nmedium-term  future  as  increases  in  Cambodian  rice  production  are  offset  by  population  growth.\nRice  has  initially  been  priced  at  a  15  percent  quality  discount  over  the  value  of  Thai  5  percent\nbroken rice. However, given the large local and regional market for rice and the gradual nationwide\nimprovements  in  communications  and  marketing  information,  it  is  expected  that  producers  with\naccess  to  reliable  supplies  of  irrigation  water  will  respond  to  quality  price  differentials  and  (i)  10\nyears from now will be receiving prices discounted by only 10 percent from the Thai indicator price,\nand (ii) within 15 years will be receiving prices discounted by only 5 percent.\n\n23.\nFertilizer prices were estimated at import-parity levels, reflecting the likely ongoing need for\nCambodia to import fertilizer.  Border prices were adjusted to  farmgate  prices  by  allowing for the\neconomic values of transport, processing, and marketing. The prices of nontraded goods were also\nadjusted  by  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  current  practice  for\nprojects in Cambodia; hired farm labor was shadow-priced at 75 percent of its market value.\n\n2. \n\nIrrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\n\n24.\nThe  volumes  of  incremental  production  and  input  use  have  been  multiplied  by  their\neconomic prices  to derive  the economic net  value  of  incremental  production,  and  combined  with\nthe  economic  costs  of  the  three  components  directly  concerned  with  irrigation  to  derive  a  net\neconomic cash flow for the irrigation components. The resulting economic internal rate of return for\nPart A is 15.0 percent.\n\n3. \n\nProviding Rural Infrastructure (Part B)\n\n25.\nThe EIRR for this component is based on the estimated VOC and APS benefits accruing to\nthe  rehabilitation  of  the  rural  roads;  benefits  from  the  improvement  of  the  six  selected  village\nmarkets were not included. The calculated EIRR for this component is 32.4 percent.\n\n4.\n\nWhole Project EIRR and Sensitivity Tests\n\n26.\nCombining the net cash flow streams for both Parts A and B yields a project EIRR of 19.1\npercent. Table A11.4 presents a resource statement with the major cost and benefit streams and\ncalculation  of  EIRR  by  component  and  for  the  entire  Project.  A  number  of  sensitivity  tests  were\ncarried out to test the EIRRs under a range of assumptions. The results of the sensitivity tests are\npresented  in  Table  A11.3.  It  is encouraging that the  irrigation  infrastructure  component  yields  an\nestimated  EIRR  of  15  percent.  The  EIRR  of  this  component  remains  above  the  12  percent\nthreshold  despite a 10 percent  cost  increase  and  20  percent  reduction  in  benefits.  The  risk  of  a\n\n\f  63\n\nAppendix 11, page 7\n\ncost  increase  beyond  current  estimates  is  low:  the  estimates  are  intentionally  conservative,  with\ngenerous contingencies, to ensure adequate funds are available despite possible economic shocks\nduring the life of the Project.\n\nThe EIRR for rural infrastructure proves even more robust when costs rise and benefits fall\n27.\nby  10  percent.  APS  benefits  claimed  from  the  rural  infrastructure  component  may  prove\nconservative  because  the  corridor  of  influence  is  assumed  to  be  only  2  km  on  each  side  of  the\nroad, whereas experience in other countries has demonstrated that it may often reach up to 5 km\non each side of a rehabilitated road.\n\nTable A11.3: Summary of Sensitivity Tests and Switching Values\n\nActivity\n\nOverall\nIrrigation & Ag.

If  the  benefits from  irrigated  agriculture  accrue  two  years  faster\nthan expected, the return to Part A increases to more  than  21 percent.  A  corresponding delay  in\nthe accrual of benefits drives the EIRR down to 12 percent. It was not considered necessary to test\nfor  the  impact  of  delayed  benefits  for  the  rural  infrastructure  component  since  road  benefits  are\nknown to accrue almost immediately after the investments have been made, and Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment's ongoing experience in road building under RIIP makes construction delays unlikely.\n\n\fTable A11.4: Resource Statement and Calculation
