The  Project  will  reorient  the  PVE\nsystem  to  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  programs,  internal  and\nexternal efficiency, and financial sustainability; and broaden access\nfor  all  segments  of  the  population,  particularly  out-of-school  youth\nand  disadvantaged  groups.  The  Project  will  strengthen  support\nactivities  such  as  accreditation,  skills  testing,  and  certification,  and\nlinkages  between  primary  vocational  education  institutions  (PVEIs)\nand  private  industry  and  communities.  The  Project  will  improve\nentrepreneurship  training  programs,  and  support  activities  both\nwithin  and  outside  the  PVE  system,  including  business  incubator\n(internship  and  start-up)  services,  entrepreneurship  consulting\nservices for small business, and small business club networks.\n\nPrimary:\nSecondary:\n\nHuman Development\nPoverty Reduction\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nThe  Government  is  faced  with  the  immediate  problems  of  increasing\npoverty and unemployment, and the medium- and long-term concern of\nskills development for economic development. Key reforms are needed\nin  the  PVE  subsector  to  improve  policy  planning,  management  and\nadministration,  financing,  training  quality  and  relevance,  equity  and\naccess,  entrepreneurship  development,  and  involvement  of  the  private\nsector in skills development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has\nalready provided technical assistance (TA) to formulate a master plan for\nthe  education  sector,  followed  by  the  Education  Sector  Development\nProgram,  which  addressed  reforms  and  investment  mainly  in  basic\neducation.  The  proposed  Project  will  be  the  next  priority  step  in  the\nGovernment-ADB development partnership.\n\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  capability  of  the\ngeneral population to obtain and maintain better means of livelihood\nthrough  employment  and  self-employment,  with  particular  attention\nto the inclusion of socially and economically disadvantaged groups.\nTo  achieve  this,  the  Project  aims  to  (i)  provide  more  relevant  and\nhigher  quality  PVE  programs,  and  reorient  the  PVE  system  to\nimprove  its  efficiency  and  sustainability,  as  well  as  its  outreach  to\nentrepreneurship\ndisadvantaged \ndevelopment  both  within  and  outside  the  PVE  system;  and  (iii)\nstrengthen  support  institutions  for  PVE  and  entrepreneurship\n\nstrengthen \n\ngroups; \n\n(ii) \n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\n\fiii\n\ndevelopment  and  support  for  project  implementation.  The  Project\naims  to  improve  public-private  partnerships  in  these  areas,  involving\nGovernment,  private  business,  industry,  nongoverment  organizations\n(NGOs), and civil society.\n\nThe  Project  will  establish  a  labor  market  analysis  system  to  link  PVE\nprograms to market demand. The Project will upgrade and consolidate\n32 existing PVEIs into 29 model resource centers, and improve 70 other\nPVEIs  around  the  country.  Disadvantaged  groups  and  out-of-school\nyouth  will  be  targeted  through  outreach  programs.  Production  facilities\nand  business \nincubators  will  be  enhanced  both  as  part  of\nentrepreneurship  training  and  for  better  PVEI  financial  sustainability.\nTechnical certification and accreditation systems will be established and\nadvocacy for policy reforms carried out through information, education,\nand  communication  activities  to  reach  the  community  at  large,  PVEI\nadministrators,  central  Government  officials,  and  lawmakers.  The\nProject will establish two development facilities, one for developing and\nfinancing training innovations, the other for supporting PVEI production\nand entrepreneurship activities. A microcredit fund will be developed on\na  pilot  basis  to  assist  start-up  entrepreneurs  trained  by  the  project\ninstitutions.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $31.3  million,  of  which  the  foreign\nexchange cost is $14.2 million (45 percent) and the local currency cost is\n$17.1 million equivalent (55 percent).\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n14.2\n0.0\n14.2\n\n10.8\n6.3\n17.1\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n25.0\n6.3\n31.3\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent\n\n80.0\n20.0\n100.0\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nA loan of SDR19.262 million ($25 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special\nFunds resources with a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during\nthe grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006\n\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP)\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  Department  for  Vocational  Training\nand  Education  (DVTE)  under  MLSP.  A  multisectoral  project  steering\ncommittee  that  will  include  private  sector  representation  will  provide  policy\nand  operational  guidance \nto  DVTE  during  all  phases  of  project\nimplementation, and maintain private sector cooperation.\n\n\fiv\n\nProcurement\n\nAll procurement to be financed from the proceeds of the loan will be carried\nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n\nConsulting\nServices\n\nThe  Project  will  provide  230  person-months  of  international  consulting,\nincluding 144 person-months of international volunteers, and in addition,\n475 person-months of domestic consulting.\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\nAll international consultants will be selected and engaged through a firm\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five years, until 31 December 2005\n\nThe Project will improve not only the skills of the country\u2019s economically active\nsegment  of  the  labor  force  but  also  the  capacity  of  unemployed  and  out-of-\nschool  youth  and  adults  to  seek  livelihood  through  better  skills  and\nentrepreneurship.  This  will  reduce  overall  unemployment  and  provide  the\ncountry with a better skilled and more productive labor force in support of the\nGovernment\u2019s  economic  transition  efforts.  Educational  benefits  include  the\nreorientation of the PVE system to be more responsive to market demand and\nthe  improvement  of  training  curricula  and  programs,  instructional  materials,\nand  school  facilities  and  equipment.  The  reorientation  will  also  make  the\nnationwide  PVE  network  more  efficient  and  sustainable.  The  Project  will\nincrease  the  sense  of  partnership  between  the  Government  and  the  private\nsector  (namely,  industry  and  business,  NGOs,  and  civil  society)  in  skills  and\nentrepreneurship  development.  Direct  beneficiaries  will  be  the  students  and\ngraduates of the formal PVE system, the new entrepreneurs developed by the\nproject  facilities.  The  Project  will  have  specific  outreach  programs  targeting\nvulnerable  groups  such  as  students  from  poor  families  (as  identified  by  the\nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  monitoring  surveys),  orphans  and  single-parent\nchildren,  handicapped  children,  and  refugees.  An  estimated  67,000  students\nand  32,000  graduates  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project  over  its  five-year\nlifetime,  of  whom  about  38 percent  come  from  the  vulnerable  groups  and\nabout  34 percent  are  females.  The  Project  will  also  directly  benefit  about\n212 administrators and policymakers; 112 PVEI directors and head teachers;\nand  2,041  teachers,  instructors,  and  administrative  staff  nationwide  who  are\nworking in the formal PVE system.\n\nTA  grant  of  $600,000  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the\nGovernment  of  Japan,  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  skills  and\nentrepreneurship  development  accompanies  the  Project.  The  TA  will  help\npolicymakers  with  policy-level  strategic  planning  in  both  international  and\nCentral Asian contexts, and recommend improvements to the Government.\n\n\f1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Skills and Entrepreneurship Development Project.

The TA was implemented in close collaboration with\nthe  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP),  and  in  a  highly  participatory  manner,\nconsulting  stakeholder  groups  such  as  central  and  local  government  agencies,  external  aid\nagencies,  schools  and  training  institutions,  private  employers,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs),  teachers,  principals,  and  communities  at  large.  A  rapid  social  assessment  was\nundertaken as part of the TA and additional poverty assessments were conducted during loan\nfact-finding  in  February-March  2000  and  loan  appraisal.  The  Appraisal  Mission3  visited  the\nKyrgyz  Republic  from  2  to  23 June  2000.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  TA,\nsubsequent  consultations  with  the  stakeholder  groups,  and  the  Mission  findings.  The  project\nframework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context\n\n3.\nSince  independence  in  December  1991,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  a\ndetermined  approach  to  transform  the  economy  to  a  market-based  system.  After  persistent\neconomic  contraction  from  1991  to  1995,  a  significant  turnaround  in  macroeconomic\nperformance was achieved in 1996, only to be set back again severely4 by the economic crisis\nof the Russian Federation that broke out in August 1998. Meanwhile, income inequality appears\nto  be  increasing  dramatically  (para.  7).  Inflation  increased  about  27  percent  in  the  first  half  of\n1999  compared  with  12  percent  the  previous  year,  largely  due  to  the  weak  currency,  which\ndepreciated  from  an  average  of  about  Som21  to  the  dollar  in  1998  to  about  Som41.5  in  May\n1999.5 Faced with this deteriorating economic situation, the Government reached an agreement\nwith  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  on  revising  the  enhanced  structural  adjustment\nfacility  program  approved  by  the  IMF  board  in  February  1999.  The  policy  package  under  the\nrevised  program  has  two  main  components:  tightening  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  and\n                                                \n1  TA 3084-KGZ: Skills and Entrepreneurship Development, for $600,000, approved on 5 October 1998.\n2  The TA examined skill areas known to be important for the Kyrgyz economy, including the areas of agriculture and\nagro-processing,  building  and  construction,  electrical  and  mechanical  trades,  light  industry,  electronics  and\ninformation technology, services (financial, tourism, food services, personal care), and arts and handicrafts.\n\n3  The  Mission  comprised  M.  P.  Perlas,  Mission  Chief;  P.  Kamayana,  Programs  Officer;  E.  C.  Sison,  Education\nDevelopment Specialist (staff consultant); and J. Cortes, Microentrepreneurship and Microfinance Specialist (staff\nconsultant).\n\n4 Real gross domestic product grew by only 1.4 percent in 1998 and 0.4 percent in the first half of 1999 compared\n\nwith 7.1 percent in 1996 and 9.9 percent in 1997.\n\n5 At present, $1.00 = Som47.6.\n\n\f2\n\naccelerating and strengthening structural reforms. Meanwhile, the country continues to confront\nserious  deterioration  of  education  and  health \ninfrastructure,  high  unemployment  and\nunderemployment, and sharp declines in income and social protection payments.\n\nAccording  to  the  preliminary  results  of  the  April  1999  census,  the  population  is  now\n4.\nabout 4.8 million with a growth rate of 1.5 percent. About 2.5 million (51 percent) are female and\n1.8 million (39 percent) are children under the age of 16. About 3.2 million (66 percent) live in\nrural  areas,  an  increase  from  about  62  percent  from  1990.  This  increase  is  principally  due  to\nmigration  to  rural  areas  as  large  state  enterprises  ceased  production  in  urban  areas  and\nemigration  of  urban  citizens  to  other  countries.6  Social  indicators  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are\nprovided in Appendix 2.\n\nAs  of  January  1998  (latest  available  information),  the  working  age  population7  was\n5.\nestimated at 51 percent of the total population. The labor force participation rate declined from\n65.2  percent  in  1997  to  60.0 percent  in  1998.8  In  the  same  period,  the  unemployment  rate\nincreased  from  5.7  to  5.9 percent  of  the  economically  active  population.9  This  figure  does  not\ntake into account the level of underemployment10 which in 1998 was estimated to be as high as\n28.5 percent. The proportion of women in the labor force declined from 51 percent in 1992 to 47\npercent in 1998. Because of a relatively young population mix, the labor force has grown from\n2.26  million  in  1992  to  2.35  million  in  1998.  Meanwhile,  the  employed  population  decreased\nfrom 1.84 million in 1992 to 1.70 million in 1998.11 The number of unemployed registered with\nMLSP\u2019s Department of Employment Services (DES) dramatically increased from 1,800 in 1992\nto  55,900  in  1998,  reaching  a  peak  of  77,200  in  1996.  The  rural  oblasts  (provinces)  of  Jalal-\nAbad, Naryn, Talas and Yssyk Kul had higher rates of increase in unemployment than the urban\nareas  of  Bishkek,  Chui,  and  Osh.  Women  comprised  about  58  percent  of  the  registered\nunemployed in 1998.\n\nThe  human  development  index  (HDI)12  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  declined  from  0.715  in\n6.\n1992 to 0.698 in 1998, reaching its lowest point of 0.676 in 1995. This places the country in the\nmiddle HDI level internationally. The country\u2019s HDI ranking has decreased from 82nd in 1992 to\n113th  in  1998.13  Among  the  three  basic  HDI  indicators,  educational  attainment  has  remained\nrelatively the most stable during 1992-1998, while real per capita gross domestic product (GDP)\n(1992  prices)  declined  steeply  during  1992-1995,  by  as  much  as  26  percent  annually.\n\n                                                \n6  Migration reached a peak in 1993 and has been decreasing ever since.\n7  Working age is defined as 16-59 years for males and 16-54 for women.\n8  In 1992, the labor force participation rate was 81.3 percent.\n9  To  be  defined  as  unemployed,  a  person  must  be  jobless  throughout  the  year  and  have  declared  to  the  census\ninterviewer  that  he  or  she  has  actively  looked  for  a  job  (economically  active).  Also,  according  to  the  Law  on\nEmployment, farm dwellers and their families are considered employed because every villager is allotted a piece of\nland, and does not fall under the category of unemployed even if in fact he/she does not have a job.\n\n10 People  are  defined  as  underemployed  if  they  declare  to  the  census  interviewer  that  they  worked  during  certain\nparts of the year but either were found unemployed during the time of interview or indicate that they were without\npaid work during parts of the year.\n\n11 The numbers of employed reached a low of 1.64 million in 1995, and has since been steadily increasing.\n12 The HDI, as measured by United Nations Development Programme in the 1999 Kyrgyzstan Human Development\nReport,  is  a  weighted  index  of  three  basic  indicators:  (i)  longevity  as  measured  by  life  expectancy  at  birth;  (ii)\neducational attainment as measured by adult literacy (for people aged 15 years or older), and the percentage of\nchildren  and  young  adults  (aged  7-24  years)  enrolled  in  the  education  system;  and  (iii)  standard  of  living  as\nmeasured by real GDP per capita.\n\n13 In 1997, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked 107th among 193 countries, compared with the other Central Asian republics\n\nof Kazakhstan (93rd), Tajikistan (115th), Turkmenistan (85th), and Uzbekistan (100th).\n\n\f3\n\nDifferences  between  the  country\u2019s  HDI  and  gender  development  index14  have  remained  small\nand stable over the past years (1996-1998). This is largely due to the comparatively high level\nof  education  for  women  in  the  country.  On  the  other  hand,  women\u2019s  share  of  earned  income\nwas low.\n\n7.\nSince 1996, poverty levels in the Kyrgyz Republic are being monitored regularly through\nsurveys  by  the  National  Statistical  Committee  (Natstatcom),  namely  the  Kyrgyz  poverty\nmonitoring survey and the living standards measurement survey. Two poverty lines are defined:\nthe  food  poverty  line,  which  characterizes  the  \u201cextremely  poor,\u201d  and  the  general  poverty  line\nwhich characterizes the \u201cpoor.\u201d15 The proportion of poor people was stable at about 51 percent\nin 1996 and 1997, but increased to about 64 percent in 1998, most likely due to the effects of\nthe  economic  crisis  in  the  Russian  Federation.  The  proportion  of  extremely  poor,  which  had\nimproved  from  about  19  percent  in  1996  to  15  percent  in  1997,  deteriorated  to  23 percent  in\n1998.\n\n8.\nPoverty appears to be predominantly a rural issue. An estimated 80 percent of the poor\nlive  in  rural  areas,  and  the  gap  between  urban  and  rural  areas  appears  to  be  growing.  By\ngeographic area in 1998, only Bishkek City and Chui oblast had populations that were less than\n50 percent poor; the other oblasts all had over 60 percent poor, with Naryn having the highest at\nabout 90 percent. The proportion of extremely poor was less than 10 percent in the urban areas\nof Bishkek, Osh, and Chui, but more than 20 percent in the rural areas, with Naryn having the\nhighest  proportion  at  about  59  percent.  Income  inequality  has  also  worsened.  In  1993,  the\npoorest 20 percent of the country gained 11.5 percent of all income. In 1998, this share dropped\nto 4.7 percent.\n\n9.\nThe  structure  of  employment  has  changed  drastically  during  1992-1998,  mainly  due  to\nthe  downsizing  and  closure  of  state-owned  enterprises.  In  1992,  about  60  percent  of\nemployment was in state bodies (comprising both state-owned enterprises and central and local\ngovernment agencies) and 9 percent in collective farms. By 1998, state bodies employed less\nthan  30  percent,  and  collective  farms  about  1  percent  of  the  working  population.  Employment\nhas been moving to individual farming (increasing from 16.5 percent to 35.1 percent) and joint-\nstock  companies  (from  nil  to  11  percent).  Self-employment  rose  from  virtually  nil  in  1992  to  8\npercent  in  1998.  A  significant  yet  unquantifiable  employment  source  is  the  informal  labor\nmarket,  e.g.,  shuttle  traders,  baby-sitters,  and  intermediaries.  Of  the  1.7  million  employed  in\n1998,  the  top  five  sector  employers  were  agriculture  (48.8  percent),  trade  and  public  catering\n(10.4 percent), industry (9.8 percent), education (8.2 percent), and public health (5.5 percent).\n\n10.\nThe Kyrgyz Republic continues to face severe social and economic difficulties. Although\nthe  economy  is  recovering  slowly,  some  of  the  main  problems  faced  include  increasing\nunemployment,  underemployment,  and  poverty  largely  due  to  general  production  decline  and\nscaling  down  of  state  enterprises.  The  Government  addresses  its  problems  of  unemployment\nand  underemployment  through  DES,  which  is  responsible  for  employment  centers  throughout\nthe country where the unemployed register for possible jobs. DES arranges for upgrading and\nretraining  of  job  seekers  in  cooperation  with  proximate  institutions  and  employers.  In  1999,\nMLSP estimated that about 173,300 people were unemployed16 in the country. Of these, about\n\n                                                \n14 The  same  indicators  for  HDI  are  used  to  measure  the  gender  development  index,  the  only  difference  is  that\n\nindexes are adjusted in accordance with the differences for these indicators between men and women.\n\n15 The food poverty line is the level of per capita consumption for each household below which, even if all resources\nwere devoted to food, the minimum caloric requirement could not be met. The general poverty line represents the\nminimum level of consumption taking into account both food and nonfood basic needs.\n16 This included 48,400 people laid off by state agencies and 13,300 employed part-time.\n\n\f4\n\n62,200  were  registered  with  DES;  DES  found  jobs  for  23,800  and  arranged  training  for  6,500\n(about 14 percent more than in 1998).\n\n11.\nThere  is  also  a  serious  mismatch  between  skill  supply  and  labor  market  demand.\nAlthough  substantial  information  on  the  labor  market  and  employment  is  being  gathered\nregularly  by  Natstatcom  (since  independence)  and  the  National  Observatory  of  Kyrgyzstan\n(since 1998),17 no regular consolidated labor market and skills needs analysis exists. There is\nno  national  employment  strategy.  Furthermore,  a  large  part  of  the  workforce  needs  retraining\nand upgrading to be able to meet contemporary skill needs arising from the changing nature of\nemployment. Thus the technical and pedagogical content of courses at technical and vocational\ninstitutions and schools must be adapted to changes in the structure of labor market demands.\nBecause  of  lack  of  employment  opportunities,  an  increasing  part  of  the  population  is  seeking\nlivelihood  through  self-employment,  mostly  in  the  informal  sector.  Because  capitalist  activities\nwere  discouraged  during  the  Soviet  years,  entrepreneurship  abilities  are  generally  low  and\nthese  abilities  need  to  be  developed  among  the  population  at  large,  and  the  legislative  and\ntaxation infrastructure improved for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).\n\n2. \n\nGeneral Education\n\n12.\nThe formal education system of the Kyrgyz Republic (Appendix 3) includes preschooling,\ngeneral  schooling  (primary,  basic  secondary,  complete  secondary),  primary  and  further\nvocational education and training, and higher education. Preschool education is available in day\nnurseries  (for  1.5-3  years  of  age)  and  kindergartens  (3-7  years  of  age).  Primary  education\n(grades  1-4,  age  6-11),  basic  secondary  education  (grades  5-9,  age  11-15),  and  complete\nsecondary  education  (grades  10-11,  age  15-18)  are  offered  in  various  types  of  institutions:\nregular  schools,  grammar  schools,  lyceums,18  and  specialized  schools  that  have  additional\nfocus  on  particular  subjects.  In  school  year  1999/2000  (SY2000),  a  total  of  about  1.1  million\nstudents  attended  1,941 schools,  all  under  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Science  and  Culture\n(MESC).\n\nIn  1995, \n\nThe  Government  has  made  significant  progress  in  developing  the  general  education\n13.\nthe  Government  requested  ADB  assistance19  with  conducting  a\nsubsector. \ncomprehensive  review  and  developing  a  national  master  plan  for  education  and  training,  and\nthen  preparing  a  project  to  address  the  identified  Government\u2019s  priorities.  This  led  to  the\napproval  of  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (ESDP)20  that\nfocuses  on  reforms  and  investments  in  basic  education.21  The  reforms  pertain  to  three  key\npolicy  areas:  (i)  sector  sustainability  and  efficiency,  by  rationalizing  the  existing  system  of\nresource mobilization for basic education and the cadre of teaching and administrative staff, as\nwell  as  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  education;  (ii) quality  and  relevance  of  basic\neducation  by  reforming  curricula,  textbooks,  learning  materials,  and  student  assessment  and\nschool evaluation; and (iii) access to and equity in preschool and basic education by formulating\na  national  strategy  to  address  the  declining  level  of  preschool  services,  rationalizing  early\n\n                                                \n17 The National Observatory of Kyrgyzstan is part of a network of institutions established by the European Training\nFoundation,  an  agency  of  the  European  Union,  with  the  aim  of  developing  an  information  base  on  vocational\ntraining and its best practices in general, and on vocational training reform in the partner countries in particular (in\nCentral and Eastern Europe and in Central Asia).\n\n18 Lyceums offer a combination of general and vocational education subjects.\n19 TA 2290-KGZ: Education and Training Master Plan, for $900,000, approved on 17 January 1995.\n20 Loan  1554/1555-KGZ:  Education Sector Development Program,  for  $32.7  million,  approved  on  29 September\n\n1997.\n\n21 Basic education refers to grades 1-11.\n\n\f5\n\nchildhood education provision, and providing assistance and funding for disadvantaged groups.\nInvestments under the ESDP, all addressing basic education, include curriculum and textbook\nimprovements,  teacher  development,  improvement  of  the  education  delivery  network,  and\ncapacity  building  and  resource  mobilization.  The  ESDP  included  TA22  to  strengthen  education\nplanning  and  administration  at  central  and  local  levels.  The  ESDP  also  includes  key  catalytic\nreforms  for  vocational  education  and  training  (para.  17)  and  higher  education  to  prepare  the\nGovernment for future development activities in these subsectors.\n\n3. \n\nVocational Education and Training\n\nPrimary  vocational  education  (PVE)23  and  further  vocational  education  and  training  are\n14.\nprovided in 105 PVE institutions (PVEIs) under MLSP\u2019s Department for Vocational Training and\nEducation  (DVTE).  Technical  vocational  programs,  with  less  emphasis  on  general  education\nsubjects, are provided to about 22,600 students. The precursor of DVTE (before 1988) was an\nindependent  body  whose  purpose  was  to  provide  professional  skills  training.  From  1988  to\n1990,  the  Government  attempted  to  place  the  PVE  system  under  the  Ministry  of  People\u2019s\nEducation  (the  precursor  of  MESC);  however,  this  arrangement  reverted  to  that  of  an\nindependent  state  committee  in  1991  because  the  single  ministry  arrangement  placed  more\nemphasis  on  general  education  and  undermined  the  ability  of  the  PVE  system  to  produce\nenough  specialists  for  the  economy  at  that  time.  After  independence,  the  prevailing  economic\nsituation called for PVEIs to assume more social functions, such as retraining the unemployed,\nproviding  skills  training  to  out-of-school  youth,  and  upgrading  and  retraining  the  adult\npopulation.  At  the  same  time,  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  required  new  training  in\nemerging \ntechnology,  and\nfinance,  management, \nentrepreneurship),  as  well  as  reorienting  existing  training  programs  to  be  more  flexible  and\nadaptable  to  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  In  1994  this  dual  employment  and  social\nprotection  role  of  PVEIs  prompted  the  Government  to  place  the  PVE  system  under  MLSP  by\nestablishing DVTE. As a result, PVE is embedded, in a more generalized form, in the general\neducation curriculum of lyceums and specialized schools under MESC, at basic secondary and\ncomplete  secondary  levels.  Another  48  postsecondary  institutions  under  MESC  and  other\nministries offer specialized technical and vocational programs in their speciality programs.\n\nskill  areas \n\ninformation \n\n(e.g., \n\n15. While the PVE system was included, in general terms, as part of the education system\nby  the  Law  on  Education  (1992),  a  subsequent  law  passed  in  October  1999\u2014the  Law  on\nPrimary Vocational Education\u2014distinguishes PVE from the general education system and sets\nout in more detail its legal, organizational, and economic basis. The goal of PVE is to satisfy the\nneeds of citizens to receive labor training through education, the main components of which are\ninitial training, qualifications upgrading, and retraining of workers who have not had vocational\neducation.  PVE  curricula24  are  implemented  by  PVEI  directors  based  on  national  standards\npromulgated by MESC for education content, and DVTE for training content. Programs offered\nin  PVEIs  must  be  approved  by  DVTE  and  typically  include  theoretical  and  practical    training,\non-site  internship,  and  student  activities  on work attitudes and ethics.\n\n                                                \n22 TA  No.  2879-KGZ:  Strengthening  of  Education  Planning  and  Administration,  for  $930,000,  approved  on\n\n29 September 1997.\n\n23 PVE is the official term for the initial stage of vocational education and training offered in grades 10-11. In the past,\nit  was  referred  to  alternatively  as  vocational  and  technical  education,  or  vocational  education  and  training.\nAppendix 2 provides basic data on the PVE system.\n\n24 The Republican Scientific and Methodological Center within MLSP is responsible for PVE curriculum development\n\nand training of PVEI directors, teachers, and administrative staff.\n\n\f6\n\nWhile the PVE law recognizes the importance of private sector involvement, currently only one\nprivate PVEI25 is operating,  and cooperation between public PVEIs and business and industry\nremains ad hoc. This is largely due to the fledgling state of private industry in general.\n\n16.\nThe entry point to PVE is after completion of grade 9 of general education. Basic PVE\nsubjects  may  be  embedded  in  the  general  education  system  under  MESC  (i.e.,  offered  in\ngrades  10-11  or  in  three-year  programs  in  lyceums  or  specialized  secondary  schools  with  the\ngraduate having an option to continue for higher education). Vocational and technical subjects\nare  offered  with  more  depth  of  treatment  and  more  practical,  hands-on  training  in  PVEIs,  in\nwhich case the graduate enters the labor market after a two- or three-year program.\n\n17.\nThe  ESDP  included  key  catalytic  reforms  for  the  PVE  system,  namely,  developing  a\nstrategic  plan  for  reorienting  PVE,  establishing  a  national  training  board  (NTB)  to  assume\nresponsibility for policy and planning of PVE and promote links with business and industry, and\nestablishing  a  task  force  to  develop  specific  policies  regarding  private  sector  involvement  in\nPVE  delivery.  The  plan \nthe  skills  and\nentrepreneurship  development  TA  (footnote  1)  and  will  be  implemented  by  the  Project.  A\nmultisectoral  NTB  and  task  force  were  established;  however,  both  were  rendered  inactive  by\nfrequent changes at senior levels of Government. The NTB and task force were combined into\nthe project steering committee for the TA and the proposed Project (paras. 57 and 77).\n\nfor  reorienting  PVE  was  developed  under \n\n18.\nThe responsibility for policy, planning, and national level administration of PVE now rests\nwith  MLSP,  within  which  DVTE  plays  the  central  role  in  coordination  with  MESC  on  matters\nrelating  to  education  curriculum  requirements.  At  the  oblast  level,  administration  is  maintained\non behalf of the central Government by akhims26 through the oblast departments of education.\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has significant influence on PVE policy and planning, as it plans\nand controls the budget according to key financial and training indicators submitted by DVTE.\n\nthroughout \n\nthe  country  with  a \n\nThe  105  PVEIs  are  dispersed \n\n19.\ntotal  of  about\n22,600 students  and  2,200  teachers  and  instructors,  giving  a  student-teacher  ratio  of  about\n10:1. The gender composition of PVE students in SY2000 was 66 percent male and 34 percent\nfemale. The industrial courses where females are traditionally enrolled are sewing, personal and\nconsumer  services,  trade  and  public  catering,  and  textile  production.  Enrollment  in  PVEIs  has\nfallen  dramatically  since  1992  when  there  were  a  total  of  115  PVEIs  and  a  total  enrollment  of\nabout 51,000. During SY1999, the system had 8,250 graduates and 10,800 new entrants. The\ndecline  in  enrollment  has  been  caused  mainly  by  cutbacks  in  the  central  and  oblast  budgets\nsince independence. Many PVEIs were left to cover their own costs, resulting in PVEIs having\nto reduce their capacity, which led to sharp cutbacks in enrollment. Another reason behind the\ndecline  was  the  general  loss  of  interest  of  the  population  because  of  the  perceived  lack  of\nrelevance  of  programs  to  the  emerging  labor  market  demand,  deteriorating  infrastructure,\nobsolete books and materials, low teacher morale, and generally falling standards.\n\n                                                \n25 There are, however, an undetermined (and increasing) number of private training agencies that focus on specific\ntraining  in  high-demand  areas  such  as  computer  and  information  technology,  accounting  and  business,  and\ntailoring, without offering the entire PVE curriculum.\n\n26 The akhim is an appointed official who functions like a chief executive officer for the oblast or raion (district).\n\n\f7\n\nApart from providing vocational education and training, the PVEIs also fulfil an important\n20.\nsocial  protection  role.  Government  policy  (as  stipulated  by  the  PVE  law  and  confirmed  by  the\nPresident  and  the  Prime  Minister  during  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Development\nFramework [CDF] Workshop on Poverty Reduction and Social Protection27  on  15-16  February\n2000)  states  that  PVEIs  provide  a  mechanism  to  equalize  employment  and  education\nopportunities  for  disadvantaged  groups.  About  one  third  of  PVE  students  come  from\ndisadvantaged groups such as the poor, orphans, children from single-parent families, disabled,\nand  refugees.  Full  or  partial  subsidies  are  provided  to  \u201cbudget\u201d  students  depending  on  their\nsocioeconomic  status  as  determined  by  means  testing  by  MLSP\u2019s  Department  of  Social\nProtection. Budget students comprise about 80 percent of PVEI enrollment; the other 20 percent\nare \u201ccontract\u201d students, i.e., self-paying students or those on a short-term program for retraining\nor upgrading.\n\n21.\nGenerally,  the  PVE  system  is  short  of  funds.  This  is  reflected  in  the  reduction  of  the\nshare of public expenditure allocated to education in general and PVE in particular. The Law on\nEducation 1992 stipulates that such allocation should not be less than 10 percent of GDP, which\nhas  not  been  possible  under  the  prevailing  economic  situation.  Due  to  insufficient  levels  of\nfunding,  PVEIs  have  been  compelled  to  innovate  and  generate  income  by  themselves.28\nHowever,  heavy  taxation  of  this  income,  which  includes  tuition  paid  by  contract  students,\ndampens the initiatives of many PVEIs.29\n\n22.\nPublic  expenditure  for  education  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  oscillated  during  1991-1999,\nranging from 3.7 to 7.8 percent. However, the relative share of the education budget allocated to\nPVE dropped steadily from 12.9 percent in 1994 to 6.9 percent in 1999. Likewise, in real terms\n(1995  prices),  total  expenditures  for  PVE  declined  from  Som105.0  million  in  1995  to  Som63.2\nmillion in 1998, a reduction of just under 40 percent. Public expenditure for PVE emanates from\nthree  general  sources:  the  central  (or  republican)  budget,  the  local  budget,  and  alternative\nsources  (such  as  contract  students  and  income  generation).  The  share  of  central  and  local\nbudgets in the total expenditures decreased from 67 and 25 percent in 1994 to 62 percent and\n21 percent in 1998. The share of alternative sources increased markedly from 8 percent in 1994\nto  17  percent  in  1998  as  a  result  of  PVEIs  being  forced  by  budget  circumstances  to  generate\ntheir own revenues. Appendix 4 provides details on PVE financing.\n\n4. \n\nThe Nonformal Sector\n\n23.\nThere  is  no  official  definition  of  nonformal  education  (NFE)  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nalthough  its  main  features  are  that  it  does  not  lead  to  an  official  certificate  of  educational\nattainment, and that it is lifelong education generally available to all segments of the population\nirrespective  of  age,  gender,  or  educational  attainment.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  NFE  has\nbasically  five  forms:  courses,  seminars,  circles,  self-education,  and  media.  NFE  is  provided  in\nsix general areas: professional skill upgrading, medicine and psychology, legal, moral, religion,\nand economics. The country has substantial NFE activities conducted by both state and private\norganizations,  largely  unregulated,  and  responding  to  labor  market  requirements  or  popular\ndemand.  At  present,  more  than  250  NGOs  are  registered  in  the  field  of  NFE,  including\nthose  established under  projects of  multilateral and bilateral aid  organizations.  Depending on\n\n                                                \n27 The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the pilot countries being assisted by the aid community using the CDF approach.\n\nThe workshop was the first in a series of workshops convened by the Government for CDF planning.\n28 Some PVEIs report generating income adequate to cover up to 15 percent of their total operating costs.\n29 Taxation was 50 percent until July 1999, when it was reduced to 30 percent, the same taxation level as that of a\n\nbusiness enterprise.\n\n\f8\n\nthe  subject  and  target  group,  NFE  programs  may  range  in  duration  from  a  few  days  to  more\nthan a year.\n\n24.\nThere  has  not  been  any  comprehensive  study  of  the  status  of  NFE  in  the  country.\nHowever,  the  National  Observatory  of  Kyrgyzstan,  in  collaboration  with  the  United  Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the European Training Foundation (ETF),\nconducted a survey in mid-1999 of 63 heads of organizations involved in NFE activities and 50\npeople  who  have  received  NFE.  The  objectives  were  to  assess  the  prevailing  situation  and\ndevelop recommendations for strengthening NFE to mitigate the impact of economic transition.\nThe findings include the following.\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nMost people require training in fields related to economics and services.\nThe  majority  of  NFE  students  were  15-28  years  and  achieved  up  to  secondary\nlevel of schooling.\nThe most vulnerable groups of people (the unemployed, the needy, and the risk\ngroups  such  as  alcoholics,  drug  addicts,  invalids)  obtain  NFE  courses  in  skills\nupgrading, medical/psychological, and economic fields.\nThe  youth  and  the  unemployed  each  comprise  about  25  percent  of  all  NFE\nstudents with risk groups comprising 14 percent.\nMore women than men use NFE to find work, upgrade their qualifications, obtain\nlegal knowledge, and improve their health conditions. Men tend to obtain NFE to\nincrease  their  economic  activity  or  acquire  a  higher  status  or  position  in  an\nongoing career.\nThe majority that NFE plays an important role in reducing tensions in society by\nincreasing the individual\u2019s activities and improving employment opportunities.\nAmong the survey respondents, 48 organizations offered NFE with funding from\ngrants  (25),  student  fees  (9),  the  national  budget  (5),  commercial  organizations\n(4), noncommercial organizations (4), and credits (3).\n\n(viii)  For training that was free of charge, the dropout rate averaged about 27 percent.\n\nFor paid training, the dropout rate was about 7 percent.\nNFE  is  less  expensive  than  regular  education,  with  international  organizations\nand  NGOs  providing  courses  at  minimal  fees.  The  most  expensive  courses\naddress market economy needs.\nThe largest source of NFE funding is grants from international organization and\nlocal NGOs.\n\n25.\nThe survey recommendations include the need for (i) comprehensive national policy and\na legislative basis for NFE; (ii) improved cooperation among Government NFE institutions and\nproviders to avoid overlap and improve targeted programs; (iii) financially sustainable NFE that\nis not totally dependent on grant support; and (iv) applied research on NFE.\n\n5. \n\nEntrepreneurship Development\n\n26.\nGiven  the  decreased  production  and  lack  of  employment  prospects  in  most  economic\nsectors,  self-employment  through  entrepreneurship  is  now  regarded  by  the  Government  as  a\npotentially  promising  engine   of  growth  and  employment  generation  in  the medium to  long\n\n\f9\n\nterm.  In  1998,  over  27,000  SMEs30  were  registered  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  with  more  than  a\nmillion  workers.  About  54  percent  of  the  SMEs  were  active  in  Bishkek.  In  addition,  close  to\n50,000 agricultural  enterprises  and  90,000  nonagricultural  enterprises  were  active.  Since\nindependence, the annual growth rate of the SME sector (in terms of numbers employed) has\nbeen  between  7  and  12  percent,  and  the  percentage  of  self-employed  among  the  working\npopulation grew approximately 10 percent per year.\n\n27.\nThe  idea  of  starting  a  business  seemed  very  distant  to  many  of  the  respondents\ninterviewed  during  the  project  preparatory  TA's  focus  discussion  groups.  The  respondents\nlacked  of  understanding  of  the  principles  underlying  entrepreneurship,  such  as  business  plan\ndevelopment,  and  marketing  and  sales  strategies.  More  than  70  years  of  discouragement  of\nentrepreneurial  behavior  is  the  major  reason.  Moreover,  attention  to  improving  technical  skills\ninherited  from  the  Soviet  period  is  still  prevalent  in  the  PVEIs.  Nevertheless  the  country  has\nentered one of the most market-oriented reform paths among the Central Asian republics. Even\nthough  some  regions  are  acutely  poor  and  many  people  have  difficulty  adapting  to  market\neconomic conditions, they have shown an understanding of the need to change.\n\n28.\nAt the macro level, growth in self-employment has been generated by the country\u2019s trade\nagreements mainly with the Russian Federation, Turkey, and the European Union, and through\nthe establishment of special free economic zones for developing companies. Other Government\nprograms  include  the  establishment  of  the  State  Fund  for  Support  of  Small  and  Medium\nEnterprises (SFSMB) in 1991 and partnerships with international aid organizations and NGOs in\nentrepreneurship  development  projects  such  as  the  Small  Business  Development  Center\n(SBDC)  assisted  jointly  by  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  United\nNations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO),  and  various  microcredit  projects.\nHowever,  these  efforts  are  hampered  by  obstacles  such  as  the  absence  of  a  comprehensive\npolicy on entrepreneurship development, an unfavorable tax code and legislative environment, a\ncumbersome system for permits and certificates,31 the prevalence of rent-seeking activities, lack\nof sources of credit, lack of reliable information for entrepreneurs on current regulations in the\nsector, and poor training in entrepreneurship and business-related subjects. Such inefficiencies\nhave fostered the growth of a large informal economy that has resorted to tax evasion; bribery;\nand informal, often usurious credit.32\n\n29.\nThe  overall  high  level  of  education  of  the  population  does  not  necessarily  translate  to\nentrepreneurial competence. Attitudes, work ethics, and service orientation are just as important\nin  developing  a  successful  entrepreneur.  Most  entrepreneurs  learn  on  the  job;  however,\nentrepreneurship  training  is  available  at  the  PVEIs  as  well  as  business  support  centers  of\ngovernment programs such as those offered at DES and SBDC. In SY2000, a total of 76 PVEIs\n\n                                                \n30  Natstatcom  has  two  ways  of  classifying  an  enterprise:  by  number  of  paid  employees  and  by  annual  turnover\nvolume  in  som.  Definitions  differ  depending  on  the  type  of  business  production  or  nonproduction  (i.e.,  trade  and\nservices).  For  production  businesses,  a  microenterprise  would  have  15  or  fewer  employees  or  turnover  of  up  to\nSom150,000;  a  small  enterprise  16-50  employees  or  turnover  of  Som150,000-Som500,000;  and  a  medium\nenterprise  51-200  employees  or  Som500,000  to  Som2  million.  For  nonproduction  businesses,  the  corresponding\nranges are (i) microenterprises\u2014up to 7 employees or up to Som230,000; (ii) small enterprises\u20148-15 employees\nor  Som230,000-Som500,000;  (iii)  medium  enterprises\u201416-50  employees  or  Som500,000  to  Som2  million.  If  the\nnumber of employees and the turnover do not match a category, Natstatcom is free to determine the classification\nas it sees fit.\n\n31Entrepreneurs interviewed during the TA bewailed the fact that over 30 signatures are needed on various papers\n\njust to open up a small business.\n\n32Apart  from  moneylenders,  informal  financing  from  family  and  friends  is  a  major  source  of  credit.  More  than\n50 percent  of  entrepreneurs  interviewed  during  the  TA  started  their  businesses  by  borrowing  from  relatives  and\nfriends.\n\n\f10\n\nprovided  entrepreneurship  training  as  part  of  the  full-time  PVE  curriculum  to  a  total  of  5,366\nstudents  (about  24  percent  of  total  PVE  enrollment)  in  subjects  relating  to  farm  management\n(3,333  students),  accounting  (1,295),  business  management  (247),  small  business  enterprise\n(188),  hotel  and  restaurant  management  (121),  office  management  (98),  and  tourism  (84).\nShort-term  training  was  also  provided  to  451  adults  in  the  areas  of  accounting  (285),  farming\n(87),  SMEs  (67),  and  business  management  (12).  That  same  school  year,  there  were  2,681\ngraduates  in  those  entrepreneurship  subject  areas.  An  estimated  40  percent  of  graduates\nstarted their own businesses.\n\n30.\nNotwithstanding  the  significant  number  of  students  enrolled  in  the  entrepreneurship\nsubjects,  many  PVEI  directors  fail  to  appreciate  the  importance  of  entrepreneurship  training,\nand  consequently  do  not  take  measures  to  develop  their  training  programs  and  encourage\nstudents. This lack of vision and appreciation is compounded by the fact that most books and\nsyllabi are obsolete, and economics teachers need retraining relevant to a market economy. A\nnumber of externally funded initiatives33have been carried out to develop more relevant subjects\nwith  accompanying  textbooks  and  materials  and  to  train  PVEI  directors  and  teachers  both  in-\ncountry  and  out-of-country.  However,  these  initiatives  have  had  mixed  results.  Some  of  the\nshortcomings mentioned during interviews with officials concerned included the fragmentation of\ninitiatives that led to lack of dissemination of successful programs  throughout the PVE system,\nand the inability to adapt the foreign programs to the Kyrgyz setting. Another factor influencing\nthe  effectiveness  of  entrepreneurship  programs  is  the  attitude  of  the  students  themselves.\nInterviews with young PVEI students show that (as is to be expected for 17-19 year olds) very\nfew  aim  to  start  their  own  business  immediately  after  graduation.  For  the  unemployed\nundergoing  retraining,  the  situation  is  different.  Generally,  these  persons  have  matured  and\ngained some working experience that can help them if they start a business. Many have limited\naccess to capital for a start-up, usually borrowed from friends and relatives.\n\n31.\nIn  theory,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  good  fundamentals  for  the  promotion  of  small\nbusinesses,  namely,  active  promotion  and  support  by  the  Government,  adaptable  attitudes\namong a well-educated population, and relatively workable (although sometimes cumbersome)\nlegislative  infrastructure.  However,  in  practice,  the  business  climate  is  difficult.  During  the\nproject  preparatory  TA,  focus  group  discussions34  were  convened  with  local  entrepreneurs  in\nBishkek, and Yssyk Kul and Osh oblasts. Findings are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRegardless of supportive government policy, legislative provisions, and advisory\nprograms supported by external funding agencies and NGOs, entrepreneurs face\nenormous difficulties in starting and sustaining a small business (para. 28). There\nare  few  business  clubs  or  entrepreneur  associations35  that  could  serve  as  a\nplatform for united action.\nBusiness subjects taught in PVEIs are not regarded as relevant to the needs of\nmicroentrepreneurs.  Programs  quality  differed  widely  among  PVEIs.  The\nentrepreneurs feel that the problem is systemwide, from irrelevant curricula and\ncourses, to poor quality of teachers, to lack of appropriate instructional materials.\n\n                                                \n33  Sources  of  external  assistance  include  the  World  Bank  (through  its  Social  Safety  Net  Project),  the  Danish\nInternational  Development  Assistance,  International  Labour  Organization,  and  the  German  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr\nTechnische Zusammenarbeit.\n\n34 A typical focus group comprised about 5-8 entrepreneurs with 10-140 employees, most of whom have been active\n\nfor more than two years. Some focus groups had representatives from PVEIs.\n\n35  The  Rotary  Club  of  Bishkek  was  founded  during  the  TA,  and  interest  among  employers  and  entrepreneurs  was\n\nenormous.\n\n\f11\n\nThe concept of business incubators, or internship programs, 36 has been actively\nsupported by externally funded programs since the early years of independence;\nhowever,  the  programs  have  not  measured  up  to  expectations  in  boosting  the\nstart-up  of  microenterprises.  The  main  problems  identified  are  that  (a)  new\nbusinesses  cannot  survive  the  prevailing  taxation  environment  and  need  tax\nbreaks  for  one  or  two  years  to  stabilize  growth;  (b)  business  incubators  are\nsubjected  to  the  same  tax  structure  and  many  have  had  to  close;  and  (c)\nbusiness  support  activities  sometimes  evolve  into  social  support  programs,  and\nnew entrepreneurs are unable to cope with the business environment outside the\nincubators.  SBDC  provides  business  advice  for  a  fee  through  an  officer  in\nBishkek and one in each oblast, but the program\u2019s coverage is modest.\nTypically,  entrepreneurs  have  difficulty  finding  sources  of  credit.  Due  to  the\nunstable banking environment, commercial banks are cautious in lending money\nto businesses that seem risky. Microbusiness poses a higher lending risk than a\nlarge  company,  and  the  entrepreneurs  find  banks  to  be  extremely  hesitant  to\ngrant  loans.  There  are  other  sources  of  credit  such  as  SFSMB,  the  Financial\nCompany for Credit Unions, (assisted by ADB), the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance\nCorporation  (assisted \nInternational\nCommunity  Assistance  (assisted  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment), and Mercy Corps International.37\nThe entrepreneurs provided mixed views of the quality of students produced by\nPVEIs.  In  Bishkek,  the  entrepreneurs  admitted  reluctance  in  hiring  PVEI\ngraduates  because  they  lack  the  right  motivation  and  training,  and  the  current\nprogram  offerings  are  largely  irrelevant.  In  Osh,  however,  most  of  the\nentrepreneurs, particularly the farmers, had positive attitudes to PVEIs and their\ngraduates.  The  consensus  was  that  PVEI  training  is  too  specialized  and  many\nentrepreneurs are willing to cooperate in influencing the design of curricula and in\nactual  training.  Under  these  conditions,  they  are  also  open  to  paying  for  their\nemployees\u2019 training.\n\nthe  World  Bank), \n\nthe  Foundation \n\nfor \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n6.  Skills and Entrepreneurship Development Issues\n\na. \n\nAbility of the PVE System to Respond to Market Needs\n\n32.\nThe  PVE  system  at  present  is  mostly  supply-driven  with  little  regard  to  relevancy,\nemployability,  or  self-employability.  PVEIs  are  told  by  DVTE  how  many  budget  students  they\nmay  accept;  funds  are  allocated  accordingly.  DES  augments  data  from  Natstatcom  and  the\nNational  Observatory  of  Kyrgyzstan,  and  conducts  regular  surveys  and  data  gathering  on\nemployment and the labor market. It has no overall consolidating and coordinating mechanism\nto develop a comprehensive national analysis. As a result, some PVE programs are flourishing\nwith waiting lists of applicants (e.g., printing, tailoring, bank management training, computer and\ninformation  technology,  and  English)  where  employment  and  self-employment  prospects  are\ngood,  while  other  programs  (e.g.,  building  and  construction,  mining  and  metallurgy,  electricity\nand  energy,  and  tourism  and  handicrafts)  are  maintained  well  under  capacity.  This  has  led  to\nlack  of  funds  to  expand  the  high-demand  courses.  A  regular  mechanism  needs  to  be\n\n                                                \n36  A  business  incubator  provides  the  environment  and  resources  for  business  survival  and  growth.  The  incubator\nconsists  of  both  production  and  training  facilities.  Most  incubators  also  provide  on-the-spot  consulting  services  to\nhelp  the  entrepreneur  during  the  vulnerable  start-up.  Other  facilities  can  be  shared,  such  as  conference  rooms,\ntelephones, and computers.\n\n37 Apart from SFSMB and Financial Company for Credit Unions, the other programs have specific target groups such\n\nas the poor, women, and rural areas.\n\n\f12\n\nestablished  to  link  PVE  program  planning  to  labor  market  signals.  The  Project  will  establish  a\nlabor market analysis system that will be linked to PVE program offerings to make them market-\ndriven.\n\nb. \n\nQuality and Relevance of PVE Programs\n\n33.\nA major defect of training programs is that they are inflexible and do not allow elements\nto be combined to suit individual needs or the particular requirements of future employment or\nself-employment.38 Nor do they provide a broad platform of basic skill and knowledge covering a\nwide occupational area on which different programs of increasingly specialized content can be\ndesigned.  Program  content  is  generally  out  of  date,  and  textbooks  and  other  study  material\nneed  replacement.  Program  curricula  needs  improvement  and  training  methods  expanded  by\nincreasing  the  use  of  modern  training  aids,  and  developing  methods  that  use  information\nprocessing  as  well  as  information  learning  more  effectively.  While  faculties  are  generally  well-\nqualified,  their  knowledge  in  their  respective  fields  and  in  teaching  methodology  need\nupgrading.  However,  virtually  no  funds  are  available  for  teacher  training.  The  Project  will\nreorient the PVE system to provide more relevant and higher quality programs, along with the\nrequisite curriculum and instructional materials development, teacher training, and facilities and\nequipment upgrading. The Project will also provide funds for innovative PVE training programs.\n\nThe  target  outcomes  of  programs  are  not  generally  expressed  in  terms  of  skills  and\n34.\nknowledge  to  be  mastered,  but  rather  in  subjects  to  be  covered  in  a  prescribed  number  of\nhours. There is no structure of standards and qualifications to which outcomes are linked. The\nonly  controls  in  place  are  students\u2019  examinations,  which  cannot  be  moderated  externally.  A\nWorld  Bank  project  (para.  50)  introduced  methodology  for  developing  competency-based\ncurricula;  however,  only  the  nine  model  PVEIs  set  up  by  that  project  and  their  neighboring\nPVEIs have been able to avail of the methodology. No systematic mechanism exists for sharing\nsuccessful programs across the entire PVE system. Two centers share this responsibility under\nMLSP,  the  Republican  Scientific  and  Methodological  Center  and  the  Information  Center.\nCurrently  both  centers  lack  the  institutional  capacity  for  this  task.  The  Project  will  provide\nconsultants and training to strengthen support institutions, including key units of MLSP.\n\nThe TA consultants noted that the quality standards for some craft skills would be totally\n35.\nunacceptable  in  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  countries.  In  this\nrespect,  enterprises  have  an  important  role  in  insisting  on  high-standard  output  from  training\ninstitutions, while enterprise managers themselves need training in skill-demand definition and\nenforcement  of  standards.  The  Project  will  establish  a  technical  certification  and  accreditation\nsystem, and provide staff development and operational support to implement and maintain the\nsystem.\n\nc. \n\nEfficiency of the PVE Delivery System\n\n36.\nThe  existing  network  of  small  PVEIs  is  inefficient,  with  an  average  enrollment  of  about\n200  students  each.  During  project  preparation,  the  Mission  found  that  the  majority  of  PVEIs\nwere  running  under  capacity,  some  were  operating  at  about  20  percent  capacity.  While  some\nconsolidation may be desirable, the process must be undertaken with care and due attention to\nspecial  factors.  First,  at  least  in  rural  areas,  PVEIs  have  a  social  role.  Their  very  existence\n\n                                                \n38 MLSP has been moving away from the overspecialization that was prevalent in Soviet times to more flexible skills\npreparation  for  future  career  mobility.  However,  former  attitudes  and  habits  are  deeply  embedded  in  the  PVE\nsystem and improvements have been piecemeal.\n\n\f13\n\nprovides economic activity and employment, and they are vehicles of social assistance for the\ndisadvantaged. Second, the country is, on average, lightly populated, with some 23 people per\nsquare  kilometer,  and  distances  between  PVEIs  are  already  quite  large.  Under  present\neconomic  circumstances,  students  generally  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  public  transport  to  come\nfor  daily  training,  nor  can  they  or  their  families  afford  private  transport.  Boarding  facilities  are\nsometimes available, even if buildings are usually dilapidated. However, the system itself cannot\nafford to establish and maintain more boarding facilities. Third, the experiences of some PVEIs\nthat are self-sustaining shows that the existing network could be sustainable, particularly if PVEI\nphysical facilities are downsized to more modest capacity and operated more efficiently instead\nof being closed outright. Certain programs offered in several institutions could be consolidated\nin one PVEI if programs are sufficiently improved to attract participants from a wider area. Thus\nthe  PVEI  network  and  offerings  need  to  be  rationalized.  The  Project  will  (i)  carry  out  a\nnationwide  school  mapping  exercise  with  the  aim  of  addressing  efficiency  issues,  and\n(ii) rationalize the existing PVE delivery network into a combination of model resource centers\nand regular PVEIs that will optimize resources and programs, as well as improve sustainability\nand outreach to disadvantaged groups.\n\nd. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the PVE System\n\n37. With  diminishing  public  budget  support,39  each  PVEI  is  left  to  fend  for  itself.  This  is\nexacerbated by a 30 percent taxation of gross extrabudgetary revenue. As a result, enrollment\nis  reduced,  access  to  PVE  is  limited,  and  technical  and  teaching  staff  are  reduced.  Also,\nproduction activity has become a necessity for survival in many PVEIs; however, this should be\nregulated  properly  so  that  it  does  not  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  academic  and  training\npursuits.  In  view  of  this,  financial  and  in-kind  support  of  the  surrounding  community  possibly\naugmented by external funding agencies becomes invaluable in the short to medium term. For\nthe  longer  term,  sustainable  sources  of  revenue  must  be  developed  for  the  PVEIs  with  the\nassistance of the surrounding communities, business, and industry. The Project will, as part of\nimproving  the  efficiency  of  the  PVE  delivery  system,  convert  excess  PVEI  capacity  into\nproduction  units  and  farms  (where  these  can  be  viable)  and  support  innovative  income-\ngenerating strategies among PVEIs.\n\ne. \n\nEquitable Access to PVE\n\n38.\nThe PVE system is not available to all those who might benefit from vocational training\nbut  do  not  apply  for  it  for  reasons  such  as  poverty  and  gender  stereotyping.  Since  students\ncannot  afford  to  pay  for  daily  public  transport,  catchment  radii  are  limited  to  a  few  kilometers.\nAlso, there is a tendency for poor rural families to keep children at home to take on family work\nwhile their elders are at school. Girls are more likely to be kept at home while boys go to school.\nOn  the  other  hand,  PVEIs  are  vehicles  of  social  protection,  and  students  from  poorer  families\nare given special assistance as far as the limited resources of each PVEI permit. A number of\nresidential  PVEIs  cater  to  orphans  and  youth  who  are  physically  or  mentally  handicapped.\nHowever,  no  special  training  facilities  or  equipment  are  available  for  the  handicapped,  and\nPVEIs  are  not  equipped  or  professionally  prepared  to  accept  handicapped  people  in\nmainstream training. Of the approximately 40,000 refugees of all ages from other countries, only\nabout 15,000 are officially registered and are thus entitled to attend PVEIs.40 The PVE system\n\n                                                \n39  The  central  budget  has  constantly  been  reduced.  In  mid-1999,  the  original  budget  was  reduced  by  10 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, payments from the oblast budgets are irregular and not subject to central control.\n\n40 Government policy focuses on training and retraining refugees to enable them to adapt to Kyrgyz society as soon\n\nas possible.\n\n\f14\n\nmust  provide  equitable  access  to  these  disadvantaged  groups.  As  part  of  optimizing  the  PVE\ndelivery network, outreach programs will be piloted and supported by the Project.\n\nf.\n\nLinkages with Private Industry and the Community\n\n39.\nPrivate industry is currently weak; its links with the PVE system are inevitably weak as\nwell.  Linkages  take  place  at  the  level  of  individual  PVEIs,  and  depend  on  the  interest  and\npersonal  contacts  of  the  PVEI  director,  e.g.,  getting  experienced  private  practitioners  and/or\nemployers  for  part-time  teaching  and  participation  in  examination  panels.  These  personal\ncontacts  come  into  their  own  when  PVEIs  are  trying  to  build  up  the  nonformal,  specially\ncommissioned training on which many rely, but community contacts in general are given more\nimportance than those with private industry. At the national level, employers have been invited\nand  sometimes  agreed  to  take  part  in  developing  national  standards.  However,  the  scale  of\nstandard  setting  activity  at  DVTE  is  modest  and  there  are  no  funds  to  pay  for  employers\nparticipation. More PVEI-industry-community partnership mechanisms are needed. The Project\nwill support the strengthening of private industry, NGO, and community cooperation with PVEIs.\n\ng.\n\nCapacity Building and Institutional Strengthening\n\n40.\nOverall financial difficulty in the sector adversely affects DVTE\u2019s capacity to manage and\noperate  the  PVE  system.  Fragmentation  of  the  education  and  training  delivery  system,  with\nschools  under  MESC,  PVEIs  under  DVTE,  and  retraining  under  DES  further  weakens  its\ncapacity. The situation is not helped by PVE\u2019s weak public image, partly derived from the history\nof  PVEIs  being  sources  of  trained  blue-collar  workers  for  large-scale  industry  and  collective\nfarms,  and  partly  from  the  perception,  more  or  less  correct,  that  the  system  serves  a  social\nprotection  role  and  accepts  students  who  are  not  suitable  for  general  education.  Internal\nmanagement  rationalization  and  training  for  headquarters  and  institutional  manager  is  clearly\nneeded,  together  with  specialized  training  for  technical  staff  involved  in  financial  management\nsystems,  training,  and  development,  not  only  at  DVTE  but  also  in  other  MLSP  units.  Capacity\nbuilding and institutional strengthening will be included in the Project.\n\nh.\n\nSkills Testing and Certification\n\n41.\nNo system or structure of national skill standards exists. Curricula describe what is to be\ntaught and the hours to be devoted to each component, but without any outcome targets. Under\nsuch  circumstances  skill  testing  becomes  a  rather  arbitrary  affair  and  each  PVEI  sets  its  own\nexaminations, without formal external quality control or moderation, although sometimes under\nthe  observation  of  employers\u2019  representatives.  The  quality  of  examinations  depends  on  the\nquality of the instruction, which is often adversely affected by the lack of training materials and\nequipment.  Employers  interviewed  during  the  TA  complained  that  they  could  not  trust  a  PVEI\ngraduation  certificate  to  reflect  the  actual  level  of  skill  competency.  The  Project  will  develop  a\nreliable  national  skills  standard  system  and  the  accompanying  accreditation  and  certification\nsystems (paras. 33-35).\n\ni.\n\nEntrepreneurship Development\n\n42.\nThe  entire  system  of  entrepreneurship  development  needs  either  strengthening  or\nreform,  namely,  the  establishment  of  an  overall  policy  framework;  provision  of  training  (both\nwithin and outside of PVEIs) in core and specialized entrepreneurial skills; provision of technical\nand  advisory  support  for  existing  and  future  entrepreneurs;  improvement  of  the  taxation  and\nlegislative \ntax\nregulations,  and  credit  sources;  and  stronger  partnerships  between  PVEIs  and  surrounding\n\nframework;  more  efficient  dissemination  of \n\nfresh  business \n\ninformation, \n\n\f15\n\nSMEs. Within the PVE system, there is a need to develop a standard curriculum design, retrain\nPVEI  directors  and  teachers,  update  books  and  instructional  materials,  and  upgrade  facilities.\nProduction  facilities  at  PVEIs  can  be  used  both  as  income  generating  units  and  as  a  training\nground for student entrepreneurs. A functional assistance approach for fresh graduates starting\ntheir  new  businesses  is  also  needed.  This  could  be  addressed  by  combining  business\nincubators  and  access  to  microcredit.  A  major  component  of  the  Project  will  address  these\nneeds, including providing PVEIs with revolving funds41 for production activities and microcredit\nschemes for microentrepreneurs trained under the Project.\n\n43.\nGroups  that  should  be  especially  encouraged  in  the  field  of  entrepreneurship  include\nthose that have strong potential for success, e.g., women,42 and those that most need a source\nof  livelihood  but  are  unable  to  find  work,  e.g.,  the  long-term  unemployed,  the  poor  from  rural\nareas, and the handicapped. According to the Bishkek office of SFSMB, less than 20 percent of\nall new ventures in 1998 were started by women.\n\nj.\n\nDeveloping a System of Lifelong Learning\n\n44.\nDespite the steady drop in enrollment over the years since independence, many PVEIs\ncontinue  to  insist  that  they  have  more  than  four  applicants  for  every  place.  However,  most  of\nthese  applicants  likely  are  those  who  have  failed  to  access  the  presently  prescribed  routes  to\nhigher  education,  which  are  desired  by  the  majority.  At  present,  applicants  who  are  not\naccepted  at  PVEIs  generally  remain  unemployed.  Alternative  approaches  in  NFE  and  lifelong\nlearning  are  needed  for  these  applicants.  Also,  the  support  and  cooperation  of  employers,\nNGOs,  and  community-based  organizations  are  needed  locally,  regionally  and  nationally.  The\nProject  will  provide  support  for  nonformal  training  through  business  incubators  and  advisory\ncenters in each oblast.\n\nk. \n\nLegislative and Regulatory Framework\n\n45.\nThe existing legislative framework such as the law on private property, and the tax code,\nand  lack  of  clarity  of  regulations  for  business  start-ups,  limit  PVEIs\u2019  initiatives  to  develop  and\nbecome self-sustaining. These limitations are unsuitable for a world of work where employable\nskills  require  more  complex  background  knowledge  and  enhanced  personal  abilities  such  as\nproblem solving and autonomy, and where everyone has the right, and is encouraged, to pursue\neducational opportunities as far and as long as their interest and talents will allow. Also, NGOs\nand community-based organizations, which have an important role to play in skills development\nfor  the  local  market,  need  an  effective  legislative  basis  for  such  activities.  Legislation  and\nregulations  relating  to  entrepreneurial  activities  and  entrepreneurship  development  hamper\nmore than help. In fact, legislative obstacles, licensing red tape, and onerous taxation are seen\nas the main reason why many small- and medium-size businesses are failing. There is a clear\nneed  for  reform  and/or  reduction  of  regulation  in  these  areas.43  The  TA  accompanying  the\nProject  will  address \nfor  skills  and\nentrepreneurship development.\n\nthe  enabling  environment \n\nthe  need \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n                                                \n41 These funds will be a one-time provision under the Project and will be sustained by the PVEIs thereafter.\n42  Experience  in  other  countries  shows  that,  apart  from  the  developmental  aspects  of  empowering  women  through\n\nentrepreneurship, women entrepreneurs fare better than men under similar circumstances.\n\n43  Areas  that  need  attention  are  tax  regulations  for  PVEIs  that  operate  production  farms  and  units  as  part  of  their\ntraining  programs,  and  the  idea  of  not-for-profit  agencies  and  how  they  are  treated  under  tax  and  licensing\nregulations.\n\n\fB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n16\n\n46.\nThe  Economic  Development  Strategy  of  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  up  to\nthe  Year  2005  is  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  national  development  plan.  Based  on  this\nstrategy,  the  Government\u2019s  Indicative  Plan  for  the  Years  1999-2001  stipulates  concrete\nmeasures for implementing the program to stabilize the economic and social situation. The main\ngoals  of  the  plan  include  ensuring  sustainable  growth,  decreasing  unemployment,  and\nimproving the living conditions of the population.\n\n47.\nEven  before  developing  the  medium-term  national  development  plan,  the  Government\nlaunched  several  programs  relating  to  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development  as  part  of  a\nholistic  strategy  with  a  theme  of  human  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  employment\ngeneration. These include the Bilim (knowledge) Program and the Cadres of the 21st Century\nProgram both established in 1996, the National Strategy for Sustainable Human Development in\n1997, and the National Poverty Alleviation Program (Araket) and the National Program for Labor\nMarket and Employment (Emgek) both in 1998.\n\n48.\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  one  of  the  pilot  countries  being  assisted  by  the  aid  community\nusing  the  CDF  approach  (para.  20).  The  Government\u2019s  priorities  for  poverty  reduction  include\n(i) pursuing sustainable economic growth by strengthening the most important branches of the\neconomy,  especially  agriculture;  (ii) adopting  labor-intensive  approaches  to  employment\ngeneration;  (iii) promoting  enterpreneurship  development  throughout  the  country,  especially  in\nthe  rural  areas;  and  (iv) providing  social  protection  to  vulnerable  groups.  The  priorities  are\nbased  on  good  governance,  decentralization  of  administration  to  the  rural  governments  at  the\nvillage  level  (ayil okmotu),  and  stronger  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  and  civil  society.\nUnder  the  CDF  approach,  ADB,  IMF,  UNDP,  and  World  Bank  are  helping  the  Government\ndevelop  its  national  strategy  for  poverty  reduction.  IMF  will  provide  support  for  the\nmacroeconomic framework and external debt management; UNDP, World Bank, and ADB will\nsupport  different  aspects  of  poverty,  sustainable  pro-poor  policies,  and  governance  issues,\nensuring  that  the  national  strategy  is  built  through  participatory  processes.  An  ADB-financed\nTA44  is  focusing  on  poverty  analysis  and  critical  targeted  interventions,  and  the  production  of\nreports  covering  community  development,  children,  women,  a  labor  market  study,  SME\ndevelopment and microfinance, export promotion, fiscal decentralization, and anticorruption.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n49. Within  the  framework  of  the  Consultative  Group  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  ADB  is\nacknowledged  as  the  lead  aid  agency  for  education  and  training.  The  ADB-funded  education\nand training master plan (para. 13) has guided the Government's development programs in the\nsector,  the  first  phase  of  which  was  the  ESDP.  The  Project  is  the  second  phase  in  this\nGovernment-ADB development partnership. A third education project, included in ADB\u2019s country\nprogram  for 2002;  is  to review the master plan and reforms undertaken under the ESDP, and\nbuild upon them to further develop the basic education subsector.\n\nSince  independence,  support  for  PVE  has  been  broad,  though  fragmented.  A  World\n50.\nBank-financed  training  component  of  the  Social  Safety  Net  Project  (1995-1998)  aimed  to\nestablish  adult  retraining  capacity,  including  the  upgrading  of  nine  PVEIs  into  model  PVEIs  in\nselected  specialization  areas.  The  World  Bank's  ongoing  Social  Sector  Adjustment  Credit\nincludes  an  employment  component  that  aims  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  active  and\n\n                                                \n44 TA 3458-KGZ: Support to the National Strategy for Poverty Reduction, for $600,000, approved on 14 June 2000.\n\n\f17\n\npassive  labor  market  programs.  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit\n(German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  has  assisted  in  providing  long-term  advisory\nservices  to  strengthen  DVTE  and  selected  PVEIs,  teacher  training,  development  of  training\nmethodologies, and development of active labor market measures. The Canadian International\nDevelopment  Agency  is  assisting  PVEIs  in  Yssyk  Kul  oblast  and  supporting  twinning\narrangements between Kyrgyz and Canadian training institutions. The European Union\u2019s TA for\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States has assisted in setting up the National Observatory\nof Kyrgyzstan, and ETF is developing pilot training of entrepreneurship trainers. A number of aid\nagencies  are  active  in  SME  development  and  training  such  as  UNDP,  UNIDO,  ETF,  and  the\nSwiss agency Helvetas. A UNDP project is presently supporting the SBDC in Bishkek and five\nother oblast branches until 2001. Danish International Development Assistance has helped with\ntextbook  development  and  production  for  the  PVE  sector.  Appendix  5  summarizes  major\nexternally  assisted  projects  in  the  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development  sector.  During  the\nproject  preparatory  TA  and  project  processing,  ADB  missions  regularly  consulted  with  and\nbriefed  representatives  of  major \ntraining  and\nentrepreneurship  development  to  ensure  that  the  Project  would  complement  and  not  overlap\nwith their activities.\n\nfunding  agencies  active \n\nin  vocational \n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB's  experience  with  the  ESDP  has  been  satisfactory,  with  MESC  as  the  executing\n51.\nagency;  experience  with  MLSP  during  the  TA  to  prepare  the  Project  has  likewise  been\nsatisfactory. In both cases, an important factor was the strong ownership both ministries had for\ntheir  respective  projects.  This  will  be  crucial  to  the  success  of  the  proposed  Project.  Another\nfactor  in  implementing  the  ESDP  was  the  frequent  changes  in  ministry  leadership.  These\nchanges  delayed  some  ESDP  components;  however,  the  problem  of  loss  of  institutional\nmemory and momentum of implementation was rectified through close monitoring by ADB staff.\nA  similar  situation  was  experienced  with  the  NTB  (para.  17),  which  has  been  reconstituted  as\nthe project steering committee. Taking these lessons into account, the Project was designed to\nfoster  ownership  among  stakeholders,  and  close  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during\nimplementation whenever changes in key personnel occur.\n\nThe  Project  design  also  took  into  account  lessons  learned  from  evaluation  findings  on\n52.\nother ADB projects45 involving technical and vocational education and training. One of the most\nimportant  lessons  identified  by  the  evaluation  studies  was  the  need  for  training  institutions  to\nforge a strong partnership with the private sector, particularly to get management and teaching\ninput from industry people. The Project will incorporate several initiatives to strengthen private\nsector  cooperation:  advisory  boards  will  be  established  for  each  PVEI  comprising  school,\ncommunity, and private sector representatives (paras. 62-63), a development facility for training\ninnovations  will  encourage  private  institutions  and  individuals  to  contribute  curriculum  and\nmethodology  innovations  (para.  64),  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)\ncampaigns  will  advocate  cooperation  with  the  private  sector  and  funds  will  be  provided  to\noperationalize  such  cooperation  (paras.  64  and  71).  The  evaluation  studies  highlight  the\nimportance  of  matching  training  programs  with  the  skill  demands  of  industry.  The  Project  will\nreorient  the  PVE  system  specifically  to  address  this  need  by  improving  curricula  and\ninstructional materials, training trainers, and establishing a labor market analysis system that will\nlink  PVE  program  offerings  to  industry  demand  (para.  61).  The  evaluation  studies  identify  the\n\n                                                \n45  ADB.  1999.

The\nProject will reorient PVE programs to address skills demanded by the market, while maintaining\nthe  social  protection  role  of  PVEIs  by  strengthening  outreach  programs  (para.  63).  The\nevaluation studies point out that final-year students of the evaluated training projects were often\nwell-prepared for further studies and/or employment, but not for self-employment. The Project is\nstrongly  oriented  to  entrepreneurship  development  (para  65).  The  evaluation  studies  cite  the\nneed  to  raise  the  level  of  Government  commitment  to  support  technical  and  vocational\neducation and training. In the case of the Kyrgyz Republic, budgetary constraints may make this\nimpossible.  The  Project,  instead  of  fostering  reliance  on  government  budget,  provides  for\nimproving sustainability at the PVEI level by developing and strengthening production units and\nfarms,  and  providing  a  development  facility  to  help  PVEIs  establish  revolving  funds  for  their\nproduction  activities  (paras.  68-69).  The  evaluation  studies  note  that  a  one-shot  approach  to\ndevelopment of technical and vocational education and training should be avoided and instead\nthe focus should be on long-term involvement. For the Kyrgyz Republic, the Government-ADB\ndevelopment partnership in the education and training sector (para. 49), of which the Project is\nthe second phase, embodies this long-term focus.\n\n53.\nSome lessons learned from the experience of the World Bank's Social Safety Net Project\nare relevant. A core of resources has been built up at nine model PVEIs under that project, and\nthese  will  be  used  and  expanded.  The  modular  model  for  curriculum  development  will  reduce\nthe  necessary  number  of  consulting  person-months  for  the  Project.  The  experience  from  the\nWorld Bank project shows the need to build an information dissemination mechanism from the\nvery  beginning  of  a  project.  A  plan  for  dissemination  of  the  expected  outputs  should  be\nelaborated  for  each  activity.  Experience  from  the  entrepreneurship  training  and  development\nprojects  carried  out  by,  among  others,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  and  the\nETF, shows the need to make a thorough adaptation of any study material that is imported from\nother countries. Mere translation, change of names and currency, and other cosmetic editorial\nchanges  are  not  enough.  These  will  be  taken  into  account  during  implementation  of  the\ncurriculum and textbook development activities under the Project.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  education  policy  paper47  is  being  updated  to  incorporate  lessons  learned  in  the\n54.\nlast  decade  and  link  education  more  closely  to  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty\nreduction.  The  current  policy  notes  DMCs  that  suffer  from  a  pronounced  mismatch  between\neducation and labor will need assistance to expand and improve secondary schooling, including\nstructural  reforms  of  technical-vocational  education  within  and  outside  the  secondary  school\nsystem,  if  they  are  to  become  more  responsive  to  structures  and  prospects  of  labor  markets.\nThe updated draft policy paper points out that while priority, in the interests of poverty reduction,\nshould  continue  to  be  given  to  basic  education,  skills  development  and  higher  education  are\nalso  important  if  a  country\u2019s  labor  force  is  to  increase  productivity  and  acquire  new  skills\nrelevant in a competitive, globalizing environment. However, support for these areas should aim\nto  increase  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  strengthen  government  capacity  to  set  and  monitor\nstandards,  maximize  cost-effectiveness,  and  give  special  attention  to  equity  of  access  for  the\npoor.\n\n                                                \n46  The  studies  cited  in  footnote  45  point  out  that  in  most  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  members  countries  technical  and\nvocational  schools  have  the  traditional  role  of  providing  economically  disadvantaged  or  intellectually  less-gifted\nyouth with access to high-quality and relevant training. This situation also prevails in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n47 ADB. 1988. Education and Development in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. .\n\n\f19\n\n55. Within  the  framework  of  poverty  reduction,  human  development  is  an  essential\ncornerstone of ADB\u2019s strategy.48 Investment in education and skills development must focus on\nmaximizing impact on the poor and vulnerable groups. In this context, ADB continues to support\nthe  Government's  education  reform  efforts  that  started  with  the  ESDP,  and  in  meeting  the\ncountry's  requirements  for  basic,  technical,  and  vocational  education.  ADB's  1996  country\noperational  strategy  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  remains  broadly  relevant;  however,  it  is  to  be\nrevised  in  2001  in  the  light  of  changing  economic  conditions,  ADB\u2019s  new  poverty  reduction\npolicy,  and  lessons  learned  under  the  existing  strategy.  The  main  objectives  of  the  strategy\ninclude  enhancing  the  medium  and  long-term  potential  of  the  country  by  investing  in  human\ndevelopment to preserve the gains under the Soviet system, and reorienting service provision to\na market-based economy. Operational strategies include assistance for education and training,\nimprovements  in  the  provision  of  public  services  including  social  services  provided  by  local\ngovernments,  and  investment  in  rural  finance.  All  these  areas  will  be  touched  upon  by  the\nProject. In addition, targeting of vulnerable groups through the PVE system will be addressed by\nthe Project through outreach programs.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n56.\nThe  education  master  plan  developed  under  ADB  TA  and  the  ESDP  are  major\nmilestones  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  the  education  and  training  sector.  While\ndialogue  focused  initially  on  basic  education,  a  review  of  the  PVE  subsector  was  undertaken\nunder  the  ESDP  to  provide  a  sound  foundation  for  reorientation  and  future  development.  Key\ncatalytic reforms  in PVE included under the ESDP were (i) developing a strategic plan for the\norientation of PVE, including a needs analysis for institutional capacity and assessment of the\nexisting  policy  environment;  (ii)  establishing  the  NTB  to  assume  responsibility  for  policy  and\nplanning of PVE, and to promote links with industry and business; and (iii) developing specific\npolicies regarding the registration and operation of private PVEIs, including taxation, licensing,\nas well as curriculum/program and accreditation requirements.\n\n57.\nExperience with implementing catalytic PVE reform was mixed mainly because frequent\nchanges  in  MLSP  leadership  disrupted  the  reform  activities.  Policy  dialogue  during  the  TA  to\nprepare  the  Project  helped  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  disruptions.  The  development  of  the\nLaw  on  Primary  Vocational  Education  was  a  significant  boost  for  concretely  establishing  the\nProject.  Due  to  policy  dialogue  during  TA  implementation,  the  NTB  was  reconstituted  into  a\nmultisectoral  body  with  three  permanent  committees,  one  for  planning  PVE  policy,  one  for\nfor  overseeing  project\nstrengthening  social  protection  of \nimplementation. While curriculum/program requirements are being addressed progressively, the\ndevelopment  of  specific  policies  on  private  PVEIs,  taxation,  licensing,  curriculum,  and\naccreditation will be carried out under the Project and its accompanying TA.\n\nthe  population,49  and  one \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Government is faced with the immediate problems of overcoming increasing poverty\n58.\nand unemployment, and the medium and long-term concern of providing skills for the labor force\n                                                \n48  R179-99:  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific. The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\n\nBank.\n\n49  This  covers  programs  and  activities  of  DVTE,  DES,  and  the  Social  Protection  Department,  all  under  MLSP,\nincluding  social  protection  within  the  framework  of  ADB\u2019s  Loan  No.  1645-KGZ:  Social Services Delivery and\nFinance, for $10 million, approved on 27 November 1998.\n\n\f20\n\nfor economic development. A competent, productive, and flexible workforce and improved self-\nemployment opportunities are critical, with a particular focus on the poor and vulnerable groups.\nThe  existing  PVE  system  does  not  effectively  address  these  needs  and  has  to  be  reoriented.\nKey reforms are required for skills and entrepreneurship development related to policy planning,\nmanagement  and  administration,  financing,  training  quality  and  relevance,  equity  and  access,\nand involvement of the private sector. Within the framework of ADB\u2019s overall education strategy\nfor  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  ESDP  assisted  the  Government  with  reforms  and  investments\nmainly in basic education and dealt with PVE only peripherally by initiating key catalytic reforms\n(para. 17). The Project will directly address these needs, and is the Government\u2019s next priority\nstep  in  the  Government-ADB  development  partnership  within  the  framework  of  the  education\nmaster  plan.  Poverty  reduction  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  Project,  as  the  exclusion  of  the\npoor  and  disadvantaged  groups  in  socioeconomic  development  will  be  addressed.  The  PVE\nsystem  is  traditionally  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  vehicles  to  provide  training  to  disadvantaged\ngroups  to  enhance  their  opportunities  to  seek  gainful  employment  and  self-employment.  The\nProject has been designed to improve the outreach of PVEIs training programs, particularly in\nrural  areas,  and  includes  entrepreneurship  development  specifically  to  address  this  poverty\nreduction  objective.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  priorities  for  assistance  to  the\ntechnical-vocational education subsector (paras. 54-55).\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\n\nObjectives\n\n59.\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  capability  of  the  general  population  to\nobtain and maintain better means of livelihood through employment and self-employment, with\nparticular  attention  to  the  inclusion  of  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged  groups.  To\nachieve this, the Project aims to (i) provide more relevant and higher quality PVE programs, and\nimprove  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  PVE  system  as  well  as  its  outreach  to\ndisadvantaged  groups  by  reorienting  the  PVE  system;  (ii)  strengthen  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment both within and outside the PVE system; and (iii) strengthen support institutions for\nPVE and entrepreneurship development, and support for project implementation.\n\n2.\n\nScope\n\n60.\nThe Project will have the following four components: (i) reorientation of the PVE system\nto address the issues of quality and relevance of PVE programs, the ability of the PVE system\nto respond to labor market needs, the efficiency and financial sustainability of the PVE system,\nand equitable access for all segments of the population; (ii) microentrepreneurship development\nto  address  the  need  for  improving  entrepreneurship  training  programs  both  within  and  outside\nthe  PVE  system;  (iii)  strengthening  of  support  institutions  to  address  the  need  for  capacity\nbuilding and institutional strengthening; and establishing accreditation and certification systems,\nand \nfor  project\nimplementation.  The  project  components  are  described  in  the  following  sections  (paras.  61  to\n73). In addition, a TA grant will be attached to the Project to improve the enabling environment\nfor skills and entrepreneurship development in the country.\n\nindustry  and  communities;  and  (iv)  support \n\nthe  private \n\nlinkages \n\nin \n\na.\n\nReorientation of the PVE System\n\nRationalization  and  School  Mapping.  The  country\u2019s  entire  system  of  PVEIs  will  be\n61.\nrationalized in terms of specialization, coverage, and outreach programs to be able to respond\nbetter  to  the  emerging  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Ongoing  mapping  of  PVEIs  will  be\nstrengthened to determine the appropriate mix of program specialization (in the context of local\n\n\f21\n\nneeds and potential) and coverage of the oblasts and raions. PVEIs will be improved to provide\nmore  relevant  and  higher  quality  training  in  more  appropriate  areas.  A  labor  market  analysis\nsystem will be established and linked to PVE program offerings to make them market-driven.\n\nModel  Resource  Centers  for  Specific  Specializations.  The  Project  will  upgrade  and\n62.\nconsolidate 32 existing PVEIs into 29 model resource centers dispersed throughout the country,\nand  selected  according  to  training  needs  in  priority  specializations  for  the  country  and  the\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  selected  PVEIs.50  Appendix  6  shows  the  distribution  of  model\nresource  centers  and  the  criteria  used  in  selecting  the  PVEIs  concerned.  The  model  resource\ncenters will, in addition to offering regular PVE programs, serve as centers for the development\nof  program  and  training  innovations,  and  dissemination  of  these  innovations  and  other\ninformation relevant to PVE. Curriculum programs and learning materials will be developed for\nthese model resource centers, and twinning arrangements will be made with foreign institutions\nto  encourage  exchange  of  technology.  Facilities  of  existing  PVEIs  will  be  upgraded  to\nprescribed  health  and  safety  standards,  training  and  office  equipment  will  be  upgraded,  and\ninstitution-based  advisory  boards  will  be  set  up  for  each  model  resource  center  comprising\nschool, community, and private sector representatives.\n\n63.\nNationwide Improvements. Other PVEIs that are not designated to be model resource\ncenters will also be upgraded throughout the country based on their submitted business plans.51\nA total of 70 PVEIs will be improved in terms of facilities and equipment. Advisory boards will be\nestablished for each PVEI. In addition, the existing curriculum programs and learning materials\nwill  be  improved.  This  will  include  outreach  programs  to  reach  special  schools  that  serve\ndisadvantaged  groups,  such  as  those  who  are  physically  and  mentally  handicapped.  Also,\noutreach  programs  will  be  developed  for  towns  built  around  large  enterprises  that  have  now\nclosed  operations.  Selected  neighboring  PVEIs  are  expected  to  be  upgraded  to  carry  out  the\noutreach  programs.  Mobile  training  units  will  also  be  established  within  each  oblast  to  bring\nteachers and demonstration classes to outlying PVEIs and NFE institutions on a rotation basis.\nThese units will be linked to model resource centers in the oblast.\n\n64.\nDevelopment  Facility  for  Training  Innovations.  To  help  improve  the  quality  and\nrelevance  of  the  PVE  curricula,  initiatives  and  innovations  will  be  encouraged  by  the  Project\nfrom  other  sources  in  addition  to  MLSP,  DVTE,  and  the  PVEIs  (e.g.,  private  institutions  and\nemployers,  NGOs,  and  individuals  or  groups  of  individuals).  A  development  facility  with  $1\nmillion equivalent funding will be provided under the Project to assist in developing and piloting\ninnovations  in  PVE  training.  The  facility  will  also  provide  support  for  IEC  campaigns  for  these\ninnovations.  Screening  and  selection  of  innovations  to  be  funded  will  be  done  by  a  technical\ncommittee52  chaired  by  the  director,  DVTE.  Proposals  will  be  evaluated  according  to  the\ntechnical  soundness  of  the  proposed  innovation,  relevance  to  priority  specializations,  use  of\nappropriate technology, development and implementation costs, beneficiary coverage, potential\nfor  replication,  sustainability,  and  potential  for  resource  mobilization  within  the  community  and\nlocal government. Details of this development facility are given in Appendix 7.\n\n                                                \n50 Details of nationwide improvements of PVEIs selected for upgrading and the extent of upgrading required may be\n\nfound in the supplementary appendixes.\n\n51 PVEI directors have submitted a first round of their business plans and their corresponding programs with the aim\nto address skill needs in their respective areas, and improve the internal and external efficiency of their institutions.\n52 The committee will include representation from the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center, experienced\nPVEI directors, and private employers. Subject-specific experts may be asked to advise the committee as needed.\nThe  exact  membership  and  specific  terms  of  reference  of  the  committee  will  be  finalized  during  project\nimplementation, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\n\n\f22\n\nb.\n\nMicroentrepreneurship Development\n\n65.\nThis  component  include:  (i)  review  and  improvement  of  existing  entrepreneurship\ntraining  programs;  (ii)  enhancement  of  existing,  and  piloting  of  new,  business  incubator\nthe  PVEIs,  establishment  of\nstrategies;  (iii) development  of  production  units  among \ncorresponding  service  units,  and  piloting  of  service  strategies;  (iv)  development  and  initial\nfunding  of  revolving  fund  mechanisms  to  finance  production  activities;  and  (v) development  of\nsupport services and piloting of a microcredit fund for microentrepreneurs.\n\n66.\nImproving Entrepreneurship Programs. The Project will review and improve the entire\nsystem  of  entrepreneurship  training  that  exists  at  present  within  both  the  formal  PVE  system\nand  the  nonformal  system  of  training  being  carried  out  by  DES  and  other  agencies,  including\nexternally aided projects and NGOs. DVTE will ensure that inputs from the various sectors are\ncoordinated and consolidated into a comprehensive strategy. Entrepreneurial core skills such as\nconfidence  building,  creative  problem  solving,  and  innovative  thinking  will  be  introduced\ngradually into all PVE training programs. Teachers and trainers will be upgraded accordingly to\ncarry  out  the  training  programs  in  a  student-centered  way.  Textbooks,  learning  materials,\nequipment, and support mechanisms will be developed.\n\nPiloting Business Incubator Strategies. Experience with production facilities at some\n67.\nPVEIs has shown that financial sustainability can be improved by enhancing such facilities. At\nthe  same  time,  such  facilities,  coupled  with  business  incubators,  could  provide  practical\nentrepreneurship  training  and  experience  to  students.  The  business  incubators  themselves\ncould  be  an  additional  source  of  income  for  the  PVEIs.  The  Project  will  improve  existing\nbusiness  incubator  programs  and  convert  existing  surplus  capacity  in  PVEIs  into  appropriate\nbusiness  incubators.  The  Project  will  also  provide  equipment  and  learning  materials  for  the\nbusiness  incubators.  Additional  innovations  of  business  incubator  strategies  will  be  developed\nand piloted.\n\nDeveloping  Production  Units  and  Service  Units. Existing  production  facilities  and\n68.\ncapacity  among  the  PVEIs  will  be  enhanced,  and  new  production  units  and  farms  will  be\ndeveloped at PVEIs that do not have them at present. New production strategies and activities\nwill  be  piloted  and  successful  ones  implemented  under  the  Project.  Staff  of  PVEIs  will  be\ndeveloped to sustain these production units and farms. Expansion of production units will call for\nan efficient system to share (or lease) and service equipment and machinery. The Project will\ntherefore  develop  a  system  of  service  units  and  pilot  service  strategies  that  would  allow\nproximate  PVEIs  to  share  and  service  their  equipment  and  machinery.  The  required  staff  will\nalso be developed under the Project.\n\n69.\nDevelopment  Facility  for  Production  Activities:  A  positive  effect  of  declining  budget\nsupport  to  PVE  has  been  the  innovations  adopted  by  PVEI  directors  to  help  sustain  their\noperations. To support and strengthen these efforts of self-sustainability, the Project will provide\nseed funding to help PVEIs establish their own revolving funds for production activities. These\nrevolving funds will be replenished and maintained through the income generated by the PVEIs\u2019\nproduction units and/or farms. Block grants will be provided to PVEIs based on business plans\nsubmitted  by  PVEI  directors.  Business  plans  will  be  screened  and  selected  on  a  competitive\nbasis  by  a  technical  committee53  chaired  by  the  director,  DVTE.  Proposals  will  be  evaluated\n\n                                                \n53 This  committee  will  include  experienced  PVEI  directors  who  have  successful  production  activities  in  their\ninstitutions.  Representatives  from  the  particular  community  and  local  business  and  industry  where  the  applying\nPVEI is located may be asked to advise the committee as needed.\n\n\f23\n\naccording  to  their  rationale  and  justification,  technical  soundness,  contribution  to  the  PVEI\u2019s\npractical  training  program,  and  commitment  of  the  PVEI  to  sustaining  the  revolving  fund\nmechanism. The total amount to be provided by the Project will be $1 million equivalent. Details\nof this development facility are given in Appendix 8.\n\n70.\nDeveloping Support Services and a Pilot Microcredit Fund for Microentrepreneurs.\nSupport  services  for  microentrepreneurs  will  be  established  under  the  Project  such  as  IEC\nactivities,  business  consulting  services  in  each  oblast,  and  voluntary  business  clubs  and\nnetworks. Consulting services will include advice on business plan development, packaging and\nmarketing,  accounting  and  finance,  legislation,  and  human  resource  development  and\nmanagement.  Business  clubs  and  networks  will  be  created  to  provide  continuing  education  to\nentrepreneurs  and  strengthen  their  business  opportunities.  A  microcredit  fund  for  start-up\nentrepreneurs  will  be  piloted  under  the  Project.  This  fund  will  provide  an  opportunity  for\ngraduates  and  trainees  of  the  PVEIs,  who  want  to  start  a  business,  to  borrow  money  after\nfulfilling standard requirements such as borrower training, preparation of an adequate and viable\nbusiness  plan,  and  proper  documentation.  The  Project  will  provide  $1  million  equivalent.  The\nGovernment,  through  MOF,  will  onlend  the  funds  in  som  to  SFSMB,  as  the  financial\nintermediary,54  at  nonsubsidized  rates.  SFSMB  will  onlend  to  subborrowers  (individuals  or  in\ngroups)  at  a  lending  rate  that  would  cover  both  MOF\u2019s  onlending  rate  as  well  as  SFSMB\u2019s\nadministrative costs, service fees, and provision for bad debts. Subborrowers will be required to\nsubmit an acceptable business plan to a technical committee55 chaired by the director, DVTE.\nThe technical committee will submit a long list of acceptable business plans to SFSMB for loan\nprocessing according to SFSMB\u2019s procedures. Details of the microcredit mechanism are given\nin Appendix 9. Details on SFSMB, its institutional capacity, and its credit experience are given in\nAppendix 10.\n\nc.\n\nStrengthening Support Institutions\n\nThe Project will strengthen institutions in support of the above two components (paras.\n71.\n61 to 70). This includes policy review, and advocacy for reform through IEC activities to reach\nthe community at large, PVEI directors, policymakers at MLSP and other agencies involved with\nPVE  policy  and  finance,  decision  makers  in  the  President\u2019s  Office  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s\nOffice, and lawmakers. Key units at MLSP and other agencies involved with the Project will be\nstrengthened  through  in-country  and  out-of-country  training,  provision  of  funds  for  systems\ndevelopment  and  operational  support,  and  consulting  services  for  key  tasks.  The  Project  will\nsupport  the  establishment  of  a  technical  certification  and  accreditation  system,  and  the\ndevelopment  of  staff,  systems,  and  operational  support  to  implement  such  certification  and\naccreditation.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen  cooperation  among  PVEIs,  local  governments,\nand  the  private  sector  through  the  use  of  IEC  campaigns  and  the  provision  of  funds  to\noperationalize  such  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  provide  support  for  reorienting\nprograms  for  staff  of  DVTE,  PVEIs,  and  local  governments;  linking  DVTE  and  PVEI  directors\nwith  industry,  NGO,  and  community  leaders;  developing  dual  training  and  industry-based\ntraining  mechanisms  to  involve  employers  and  industry  groups;  and  establishing  voluntary\nbusiness clubs.\n\n                                                \n54 SFSMB is a nonprofit state agency established in 1991 to provide support to SMEs by means of financing, training,\nand  consultative  and  informational  advice,  and  other  services  as  needed.  SFSMB  has  regional  offices  in  each\noblast (except Batken) and has been providing credit to SMEs since 1992.\n\n55 This committee will include PVEI directors with technical experience in preparing business plans. Advice will also\n\nbe sought from specialists of the UNDP-assisted SBDC as needed.\n\n\f24\n\nd.\n\nSupport for Project Implementation\n\n72.\nThe Project will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) in Bishkek and a sub-PIU in\nOsh,56  to  implement  the  project  activities  efficiently  and  effectively.  Appendix  11  provides  the\norganizational  structure  of  project  implementation.  Key  staff  in  the  PIU  will  be  on  a  full-time\nbasis and will include the project manager, a finance and administrative officer, a civil works and\nprocurement officer, and a consultant services and staff development officer. The sub-PIU will\nbe  similarly  staffed  by  full-time  key  staff;  however,  instead  of  a  project  manager,  it  will  be\nheaded by a project coordinator who will report to the PIU\u2019s project manager. Each unit will be\nprovided with the necessary facilities, equipment, and a vehicle. Also, key PIU and sub-PIU staff\nwill  be  trained  in  project  planning  and  management,  and  in  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures.\nConsultants  for  project  and  financial  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  midterm\nreview  will  augment  the  PIU  staff.  The  Project  will  also  provide  the  necessary  funding  for  the\nPIUs\u2019 recurrent operational expenses under normal Government budgetary allocations.\n\n73.\nThe development activities required for the Project are summarized as follows: Appendix\n12\u2014staff development; Appendix 13, consulting services; Appendix 14, textbooks and learning\nmaterials; Appendix 15, civil works; and Appendix 16, equipment and furniture.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n74.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $31.3  million  equivalent,  of  which  $14.2\nmillion (45 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $17.1 million equivalent (55 percent) is the\nlocal currency cost. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 17.\n\n75.\nADB will provide a loan of $25 million equivalent from its Special Funds sources and the\nbalance of $6.3 million equivalent will be provided by the Government. The Borrower will be the\nKyrgyz Republic and the loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years,\nwith an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter. The loan will include financing of the interest charge. The Government and ADB will\nseek  out  possible  cofinancing  sources  for  the  Project,57  and  in  the  event  cofinancing\nmaterializes,  the  corresponding  portion  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  reallocated  to  other  project\ncomponents  or  canceled  as  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 18.\n\n                                                \n56The  geographic  separation  between  north  and  south  necessitates  establishing  the  sub-PIU  in  Osh.  This  will\n\nminimize delays and frequent (and costly) commuting by PIU staff between Bishkek and Osh.\n\n57OWZ  Bayern,  an  agency  of  the  German  state  of  Bavaria,  has  expressed  interest  in  providing  parallel  grant\ncofinancing  for  the  out-of-country  training.  OWZ  Bayern  has  the  explicit  policy  of  supporting  the  democratization\nprocess and the move to a market economy in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, linking\nits training programs in these countries to about 70 training institutions in Bavaria. It has designed and carried out\nan  ETF-assisted  training  of  trainers  program  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  1999  for  small  business  trainers  and\nadvisers.  DVTE  officials  have  confirmed  that  OWZ's  performance  in  this  project  was  satisfactory.  The\narrangements for cooperation are being finalized by ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations.\n\n\f25\n\n8.7\n1.9\n0.7\n0.5\n11.7\n\n0.6\n0.7\n1.3\n\n1.2\n14.2\n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent of\nBase Cost\n\nA.

A multisectoral\nproject  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  minister,  MLSP,  and  including  the  project  director,\nwith appropriate representation from various stakeholder groups such as DVTE; MESC; MOF;\nMinistry of Industry and Foreign Trade; State Committee for Foreign Investments and Economic\nDevelopment  (Goscominvest);  SFSMB;  other  government  agencies  as  appropriate;  private\n\n\f26\n\nsector (e.g., the Chamber of Commerce of the Kyrgyz Republic); and NGOs will provide policy\nguidance  for  the  Project.  DVTE,  with  guidance  from  the  project  steering  committee,  will  be\nresponsible  for  coordinating  and  consolidating  multisectoral  views  and  inputs.  The  PIU  will  be\nheaded by a project manager to be appointed by the Government subject to the concurrence of\nADB. The PIU and the sub-PIU (para. 72) will be responsible for day-to-day aspects of project\nimplementation  in  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility.  To  ensure  timely  and  effective\ninstitutional  response  to  project  needs,  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  be  shared\nby  various  central  and  local  agencies.  DVTE\u2019s  role  will  mainly  be  in  policy  coordination  and\nplanning at the central level and overall supervision of the PIU. DVTE's oblast coordinators for\nPVE will assume a coordination and monitoring role in their respective localities for curriculum\nand materials development, facilities and equipment upgrading, and support activities. Appendix\n19 provides an implementation responsibility matrix for the Project.\n\n1.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n78.\nThe Project will be implemented over five years beginning about January 2001. As soon\nas  the  Project  becomes  effective,  the  PIU  will  start  recruiting  international  and  domestic\nconsultants for the lead-in activities such as project management and finance, school mapping\nand rationalization, planning and development of model resource centers, planning of outreach\nprograms for disadvantaged groups, planning and development of entrepreneurship programs,\nand monitoring and evaluation. Also, detailed planning and implementation of staff development\nprograms  under  the  Project  will  start.  Rationalization  of  the  PVE  system  according  to  the\nfindings of the school mapping exercise will commence in the second year of the Project, along\nwith  curriculum  and  instructional  materials  development,  implementation  of  entrepreneurship\nprograms,  engagement  of  volunteers  for  curriculum  implementation,  finalization  and  execution\nof contracts for facilities and equipment upgrading, and implementation of the two development\nfacilities for training innovations and production activities, as well as the pilot microcredit fund.\nThereafter, the Project will be in full swing. The Project implementation schedule is included as\na supplementary appendix.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement of Goods\n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines for\n79.\nProcurement. Appendix 20 summarizes the procurement packaging for the Project. Discussions\nwere  held  with  the  project  director  designate  and  the  project  manager  designate  on  ADB's\nanticorruption  policy  and  the  need  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  in  all  project\nactivities. They were advised that (i) ADB will reject a proposal of award if it determines that a\nbidder  has  engaged  in  corrupt  or  fraudulent  practices  when  competing  for  the  contract  in\nquestion; (ii) any expenditure incurred with or through corrupt or fraudulent practices will not be\nreimbursable; (iii) any firm or individual found to have engaged in such practices will be declared\nineligible  for  ADB-financed  contracts,  either  indefinitely  or  for  a  stated  period;  and  (iv)  where\nsuch  practices  have  been  engaged  in  and  the  Government  has  not  taken  a  timely  and\nappropriate remedial action, the relevant portions of the loan may be canceled.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\n80.\nCivil works under the Project will involve the renovation and consolidation of facilities of\n32  PVEIs  to  become  29  model  resource  centers,  small  refurbishment  of  up  to  70  PVEIs,  and\nrefurbishment of at least 12 dormitories and of the main DVTE building in Bishkek. These civil\nworks components are small and scattered throughout the country and are unlikely to attract the\ninterest  of  international  construction  firms.  Therefore,  procurement  will  be  through  local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  without  precluding  interested  foreign\n\n\f27\n\nbidders  from  participating.  Contractors  will  be  required  to  give  appropriate  warranties  for  their\nwork.\n\nb. \n\nEquipment, Instructional Materials, and Service Vehicles\n\n81.\nTo the extent possible, procurement will be arranged in such a way that each package or\ncontract  award  will  be  appropriate  for  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  for\ngoods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and  for  goods  with  a  total  estimated  value  of\n$500,000  or  less,  international  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed.  Items  costing  less  than\n$100,000  equivalent  (such  as  service  vehicles)  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchase\nprocedures.  Major  packages  include  machine  tools,  automotive  repair  equipment,  hotel  and\ncatering equipment, agriculture and agroprocessing equipment, construction training equipment,\nelectronic  repair  training  equipment,  textile  training  equipment,  and  computers.  All  equipment\nprocured will be appropriate for use in training programs rather than full production equipment.\nThe PIU will prepare lists and specifications of goods to be provided.\n\n3.\n\nStaff Training and Development\n\n82.\nThe  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  392  person-months  of  out-of-country  training  for\n212 administrators  and  head  teachers,  and  2,195  person-months  of  local  training  for\n2,565 trainers, teachers, and administrators in curriculum and textbook development, local and\nregional  administration  of  education  and  training,  computer  literacy,  training  skills  upgrading,\norganization  of  distance  education,  career  guidance,  accreditation  and  certification,  skills\nstandard development, work health, and safety. The programs will range from one week to three\nmonths, and will be conducted at central and regional levels. Cofinancing of the out-of-country\ntraining is being finalized with OWZ Bayern.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n83.\nThe  Project  provides  for  a  total  of  86  person-months  of  international  consulting,\n144 person-months  of  international  volunteer  services,  and  475  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting. The international consultants, with input duration ranging from 2 to 18 months, and\ncovering a wide range of specializations, will assist DVTE, the model resource centers, and the\nPVEIs  covered  by  the  Project  in  all  aspects  of  training  and  development.  The  volunteers  will\nwork  on  implementing  curriculum  and  producing  training  materials.  The  domestic  consultants\nwill  act  as  counterpart  staff  to  the  international  consultants  and  will  support  them  in  their\nassignments.  The  selection  and  recruitment  of  international  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in\nseparate packages through a combination of individuals and an international firm in accordance\nwith  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The  volunteers  will  be  selected  by  the  PIU\ninstitutional  arrangements  with  multilateral  organizations  (e.g.,  United  Nations\nthrough \nvolunteers) or bilateral agencies under arrangements acceptable to ADB. Domestic consultants\nwill be recruited by the PIU under arrangements acceptable to ADB. The terms of reference of\nthe consultants are summarized in Appendix 13.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund\n\n84.\nAll  forms  of  disbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with\nGovernment and ADB guidelines and procedures. An imprest account will be established after\nloan  effectiveness  to  expedite  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds.  The  imprest  account  will  be\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed\nestablished \narrangements between the Government and ADB. The account will be opened by the PIU in a\n\n\f28\n\ncommercial  bank  to  be  selected  according  to  Government  and  ADB  guidelines.  The  initial\namount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed six months of project expenses\nand  is  estimated  at  $500,000.  The  PIU  will  prepare,  in  consultation  with  DVTE,  MOF,  and\nGoscominvest, the draft formulation of project expenditures for all activities for the five-year life\nof the Project, complete with estimates for each year of project implementation. These budgets\nwill be reviewed and updated every six months. All budgets will be reviewed and approved by\nMOF before implementation. Project expenditures will be recorded at source by the PIU and the\nsub-PIU.  The  PIU  will  approve  and  supervise  all  drawdown  arrangements.  Each  facility,\nrehabilitation contractor, and supplier of equipment and furniture receiving project funds will be\nrequired  to  open  an  account  with  a  commercial  bank  into  which  the  funds  will  be  paid.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  followed  to  liquidate  the  imprest  account  and  to\nreimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000 equivalent.\n\n85. While  the  development  facilities  for  training  innovations  and  production  activities  are\ngoverned by their own specific procedures as discussed in Appendixes 7 and 8, the funds for\nthese development facilities will be disbursed according to the same guidelines and procedures\nas for other project components. Upon approval of proposals and PVEI business plans by the\nrespective technical committees, the PIU may use either the Project's imprest account or submit\nwithdrawal applications to ADB to release the required funds.\n\nThe microcredit fund will be onlent by MOF to SFSMB in a phased manner as agreed to\n86.\nby SFSMB, DVTE, and ADB, according to the guidelines discussed in Appendix 9. The goods\nand  services  to  be  financed  by  the  individual  subloans  will  be  purchased  from  ADB  member\ncountries.  The  first  10  microcredit  applications  slated  for  approval  will  be  reviewed  jointly  with\nADB by fax, electronic mail, or hard copy before final approval is given by SFSMB.\n\n6. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\nThe  PIU  will  prepare  and  provide  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and\n87.\nprovide them to ADB within 30 days of the respective period. The reports will be provided in a\nformat  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  include  progress  made  against  established  targets  and\nproblems encountered during the period under review, steps taken and proposed to be taken to\nresolve  the  problems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  proposed  work  program  to  be\nundertaken  during  the  succeeding  quarter.  The  PIU  and  sub-PIU  will  monitor  the  progress  of\nimplementation in their respective areas of responsibility. Within three months after the physical\ncompletion of the Project, DVTE will submit a project completion report to ADB providing details\non implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and evaluation.\n\n88.\nSeparate records and accounts for all expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of\nthe loan will be maintained by DVTE in accordance with sound accounting principles. They will\nspecify the expenditures for all activities and identify all expenditures to be financed out of the\nloan  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial  statements,  statements  of  expenditures,\nand  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\nauditors\u2019 report, and copies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including\nthe auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use\nof the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures, will be submitted to\nADB in English not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n\f29\n\n7. \n\nMidterm Review\n\n89.\nIn addition to semiannual reviews, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken\nby the Government and ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation to\nassess the Project\u2019s progress and achievements against its objectives; to identify any difficulties\nbeing encountered; and to recommend remedial action, if and where required.\n\n8. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n90.\nDVTE  will  develop  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  subsystem  within  the  integrated\nmanagement  information  system  for  the  PVE  system  to  collect  and  analyze  data  for\nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the PVE system,\nas well as to measure PVEI-level sustainability. The subsystem will include information on the\nProject,  including  staff  and  student  flows,  internal  and  external  efficiency  indicators,  the  staff\ndevelopment program, the status of facilities and equipment, and education costs and finance.\nThe subsystem will also include those indicators specified in the project framework in Appendix\n1.  Additional  indicators  for  the  subsystem  will  be  developed  by  DVTE  and  the  finalized\nsubsystem  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  within  three  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nNo  adverse  environmental  effects  are  expected  from  the  Project.  Civil  works  will  be\n\n91.\nmostly upgrading of existing PVEI facilities scattered throughout the country.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n92.\nDuring  Project  preparation,  a  social  sector  analyst  was  included  in  the  TA  consultant\nteam and a poverty specialist was engaged to participate in loan fact finding. The social sector\nanalyst  identified  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups  in  the  different  regions  of  the  country\n(including gender analysis), and carried out a social impact analysis. Thereafter, measures were\nincorporated into the Project design to address the needs of these identified vulnerable groups\nand  to  mitigate  potential  negative  social  impacts.  The  poverty  specialist,  through  field  visits,\nvalidated  the  social  analysis  and  made  additional  recommendations  to  strengthen  the  poverty\nreduction  aspects  of  the  Project.  Measures  incorporated  into  the  Project  design  as  a  result  of\nthis  process  include  the  use  of  mobile  training  units  and  outreach  programs,  the  microcredit\nfund, use of NGOs to implement parts of the Project, disaggregation of labor market and benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation information requirements to enable gender and poverty analysis, and\nstrong support for IEC and advocacy campaigns. Also, the TA was carried out in a participatory\nmanner. At the start of the TA, a national visioning workshop was held with various stakeholder\ngroups  to  identify  the  characteristics  required  of  a  well-functioning  skills  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment system in the Kyrgyz context. As a result of this process, Project objectives were\ngrouped  into  key  result  areas.  Each  key  result  area  was  validated  through  visits  to  all  oblasts\nusing focus group discussions among stakeholder groups and rapid assessment surveys. In the\nprocess, awareness of the Project was raised among these groups.\n\nH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n93. While the Project addresses the comprehensive and more urgent development needs in\nfor  skills  and\nskills  and  entrepreneurship  development, \n\nthe  enabling  environment \n\n\f30\n\nentrepreneurship  development  in  the  country  also  need  to  be  improved  (para.  42).  This  will\nrequire not only improving the policy and legislative environment but also developing a medium-\nto  long-term  vision  and  strategic  framework  and  action  plans  for  skills  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment in the country in both international and Central Asian contexts. To carry this out,\nsupporting  TA  will  be  provided  to  help  MLSP  with  this  strategic  process,  and  to  improve  the\nenabling environment. The TA will build upon the activities started during the project preparatory\nTA  and  assist  MLSP  officials  in  carrying  out  external  and  internal  scanning  of  the  country\u2019s\nstrengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  with  respect  to  skills  and  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment. Existing legislation will be reviewed, constraints identified, and recommendations\nfor  improvement  submitted  to  the  Government.  Thereafter,  IEC,  advocacy  campaigns,  and\nsocial  marketing  of  policies  and  plans  will  be  conducted.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  about\n$742,000 equivalent, comprising $464,000 in foreign exchange cost and $278,000 equivalent in\nlocal currency cost. Of these costs, ADB will provide $600,000 on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to finance the entire foreign exchange cost\nand part of the local currency cost. A description of the TA is given in Appendix 21.\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis58\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nTo  improve  its  economic  performance  and  be  competitive  both  globally  and  in  Central\n94.\nAsia,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  needs  to  produce  a  competent  and  productive  workforce  (both\nemployed  and  self-employed)  that  can  respond  flexibly  to  market  demand.  This  will  require\nreorienting  the  country\u2019s  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development  systems  to  provide  quality\ntraining that is relevant and market-driven. The Project will reorient the formal PVE system and\nstrengthen  the  nonformal  sector  of  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development  to  address  this\nneed.  The  establishment  of  a  labor  market  analysis  system  and  skills  certification  and\naccreditation  systems  will  ensure  the  quality  and  relevance  of  PVE  programs.  With  improved\nquality  and  relevance,  it  is  expected  that  quantitative  and  qualitative  improvements  in\nemployment  and  self-employment  are  expected  to  be  realized  among  both  the  general\npopulation  and  disadvantaged  groups.  In  addition  to  improving  the  skills  of  the  country\u2019s\nworkforce,  the  Project\u2019s  improvements  in  entrepreneurship  development  will  also  contribute  to\nemployment  generation,59  particularly  in  the  sectors  of  agriculture  and  financial  and  business\nservices.\n\n95.\nThe Project\u2019s mapping exercise will lead to a rationalization of the PVE system that will\nimprove efficiency of the PVE delivery network and sustainability of PVEIs, as well as outreach\nto  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups.  The  Project  will  introduce  best  practices  in  training\nmethods and curricula that are appropriately adapted to local conditions and needs.\n\nThe two development facilities and the microcredit fund provided under the Project will\n96.\nallow  more  equitable  distribution  of  benefits  to  institutions  and  individuals.  The  development\nfacility for training innovations will promote innovative curriculum and program development by\nboth private and public sector entities, and strengthen ownership for these programs as they are\nimplemented.  The  development  facility  for  production  activities  will  not  only  enhance  the\nsustainability  of  PVEIs  but  also  induce  PVEI  directors  to  rationalize  business  plans  for  their\n                                                \n58  The  analysis  provided  herein  is  qualitative  both  because  of  data  constraints  and  because  the  Project\u2019s  benefits\n\ncannot be adequately quantified for a rate of return analysis.\n\n59 With the present experience that about 40 percent of PVEI entrepreneurship graduates eventually start their own\nbusinesses (para. 29), even as microentrepreneurs with less than 7 paid employees, the employment generation\npotential would be significant.\n\n\f31\n\nrespective  institutions  as  a  requirement  for  availing  of  the  fund.  The  microcredit  fund  will  give\nenterprising PVEI graduates an opportunity to start their own small businesses. To avail of this\nfund,  these  graduates  will  have  developed  sound  business  plans  in  cooperation  with  their\nrespective PVEIs and thus improve the likelihood of success in starting up their businesses.\n\n97.\nThe  accompanying  TA  will  establish  the  long-term  policy  and  strategy  framework  for\nskills  and  entrepreneurship  development  in  the  country  and  recommend  legislation  for\nGovernment  and/or  Parliament  approval  that  will  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  skills\nand  entrepreneurship  development.  The  Project  will  also  improve  private  sector,  NGO,  and\ncommunity cooperation with PVEIs and local government units.\n\n98.\nEducational  and  institutional  improvements  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  will\nimprove  29  model  resource  centers  and  70  regular  PVEIs  in  addition  to  an  undetermined\nnumber of NGOs and other NFE institutions that will be able to avail of curriculum and program\nimprovements. The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the students, graduates, teachers,\nand administrators of the formal PVE system, and the new entrepreneurs trained using project\nfacilities.  Assuming  existing  levels  of  enrollments  and  graduation60  and  the  same  structural\nproportions  of  gender  and  disadvantaged  students,  an  estimated  67,000  students  and  32,000\ngraduates will benefit over the five-year lifetime of the Project, of whom about 34 percent would\nbe female and 38 percent would come from poor and disadvantaged families, such as orphans,\nsingle-parent  families,  handicapped  children,  and  refugees.  A  total  of  212 administrators  and\npolicymakers,  112  PVEI  directors  and  head  teachers,  and  2,041  teachers,  instructors,  and\nadministrative staff nationwide will benefit from the country\u2019s staff development programs.\n\nAt  project  completion,  incremental  recurrent  expenditures  to  sustain  new  interventions\n99.\nintroduced by the Project will amount to about 17 percent of the 1998 recurrent expenditures for\nPVEIs.61  Despite  present  public  budget  constraints,  these  incremental  expenditures  are\nexpected  to  be  met  as  (i)  the  newly  reoriented  PVE  system  will  offer  higher  quality  and  more\nrelevant training programs that will attract and retain more fee-paying students; and (ii) the PVEI\ndirectors  have  demonstrated  sufficient  resourcefulness  and  ability  to  mobilize  resources  from\nthe community and the surrounding business and industry, and to generate their own revenue\nthrough production activities. The Project is designed to strengthen both.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n100.\nFemale  enrollment  in  the  PVEIs,  which  comprises  about  34  percent  of  total  enrollment\n(Appendix  2),  gravitates  to  the  agriculture  and  service  sectors.  Over  90  percent  of  females\nestimated  to  be  enrolled  in  courses  for  light  industry  (sewing,  textiles),  services  (catering,\ntourism, personal, and health care) and agriculture. Of the 29 model resource centers, eight are\nin  the  services  sector,  eight  in  agriculture,  and  three  in  light  industry.  These  resource  centers\nwill  contribute  directly  to  improving  the  employability  of  women  in  the  long  term.  The  ratio  of\nunemployed females to unemployed males (as registered with DES) is about 3:2. The Project\u2019s\naim to reduce unemployment will be expected to benefit women in the same proportion.\n\n                                                \n60 This may be considered a conservative assumption because, as the quality and relevance of PVE improves under\n\nthe Project, enrollment figures will likely increase.\n\n61 1998 figures are the latest available figures, expenditures for 2000 are estimated to be at the same level.\n\n\fC. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n32\n\n101.\nThe  PVEIs  cater  to  a  large  segment  of  the  disadvantaged  group  of  students,  namely,\nthose  who  are  not  able  to  secure  a  place  in  the  general  education  stream  and  those  who  are\nfrom  poor  and/or  refugee  families,  orphans  or  from  single-parent  families,  or  disabled.  Budget\nstudents  (who  comprise  about  80  percent  of  total  PVE  enrollment)  are  fully  or  partially\nsubsidized by the Government budget according to means-tested criteria applied by the Social\nProtection  Department  of  MLSP.  The  Project  will  improve  the  employability  and  self-\nemployability of  these students, and  give them an opportunity to break away from the poverty\ncycle experienced by their families.\n\nThe  existing  poverty  surveys62  indicate  that  reliance  on  agricultural  subsistence  and\n102.\nwage  earnings  is  directly  correlated  with  a  rural  family\u2019s  level  of  poverty.  The  eight  model\ncenters  to  be  developed  in  agriculture  production  and  processing  dispersed  throughout  the\ncountry  are  expected  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  agriculture-related  activities  and  income\nproduction  capability  particularly  in  the  rural  areas.  The  PVEIs  also  serve  another  particularly\ndisadvantaged  group\u2014those  living  in  company  towns  built  around  large  state  enterprises  that\nhave  closed down since  independence. Most of these towns are served by PVEIs that will be\nimproved  under  the  Project.  In  addition,  the  outreach  programs  to  be  developed  under  the\nProject will serve towns that do not have a PVEI in their area.\n\n103.\nThe  microcredit  fund  under  the  Project  will  also  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The\nsymbiotic  link  between  training  and  microcredit  will  be  most  effective  among  the  poor  and\ndisadvantaged  groups  of  PVEI  graduates  whose  only  option  is  to  start  a  small  business.  The\navailability of microcredit will provide them with an immediate opportunity to translate their newly\nacquired skills into a business.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n104. Although  DVTE  has  experience  implementing  a  component  of  a  past  World  Bank\nproject,  the  magnitude  and  complexity  of  the  Project  will  be  a  major  challenge  to  DVTE\u2019s\nimplementation  capacity.  The  implementation  responsibility  matrix  in  Appendix  19  shows  that\nthe challenge of Project implementation will be shared by DVTE with various other central and\nlocal units. Staff turnover is also an inevitable concern, as experience with the ESDP and past\nTAs  demonstrates.  The  same  implementation  responsibility  matrix  will  serve  as  a  guide  to\ninstitutional responsibilities and enhance the continuity of project activities. Also, vigilant project\nadministration and monitoring by ADB staff will be a key factor for continuity. Another concern is\nthat  English  is  not  widely  understood  by  PIU  and  DVTE  staff.  The  Project  includes  staff\ndevelopment and consulting services to strengthen DVTE in this regard. Also, provision is being\nmade to translate key project documents into Russian (such as this report, the Loan and Project\nAgreements, and the Project administration memorandum).\n\nThe  existing \n\nlegislative  and \n\n105.\ntaxation  environment  surrounding  skills  and\nentrepreneurship  development  will  tend  to  hamper  some  of  the  Project\u2019s  activities,  particularly\nfor  the  start-up  entrepreneurs  who  will  be  trained  by  the  Project.  The  accompanying  TA  for\nimproving  the  enabling  environment  is  designed  to  address  this  concern  in  addition  to  its\nproactive visioning and strategy formulation.\n\n                                                \n62 Kyrgyz poverty monitoring surveys and living standards measurement surveys.\n\n\f33\n\nThe  overall  lack  of  budgetary  funds  for  the  PVE  system  will  also  pose  a  risk  to  the\n106.\nProject.  The  Project  is  designed  to  strengthen  PVEI-level  sustainability  by  improving\nparticipatory  development  partnerships  at  the  institution  and  community  level,  as  well  as\nstrengthening  the  income-generating  capacity  of  PVEIs.  The  Project  provides  development\nfacilities to support start-up of these activities.\n\nA. Specific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n107.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nWithin  one  year  of  the  completion  of  the  school  mapping,  the  Government  will\nsubmit  to  ADB  its  plan  to  rationalize  the  PVE  sector  and  thereafter  commence\nthe rationalization.\n\n(ii)  Within  six  months  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  MLSP  through  the  PIU  will\nsubmit  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,  details  of  the  staff  development  programs.  The\nPIU  will  incorporate  bonding  agreements  with  the  out-of-country  training\nprograms  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project,  with  the  aim  of  multiplying  the\ntraining to other staff as appropriate.\nThe  first  10  microcredit  applications  slated  for  approval  by  SFSMB  will  be\nreviewed jointly with ADB before final approval.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Within  three  months  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  DVTE  will  develop\nindicators  for  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  subsystem,  and  submit  the\nspecifications of the finalized subsystem for ADB\u2019s concurrence.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\n108. Before  the  loan  becomes  effective,  MLSP  will  appoint  the  project  director,  the  project\nmanager, and key staff of the PIU and sub-PIUs, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence.\n\nC.\n\nConditions for Disbursement\n\nFour  conditions  must  be  met  relating  to  establishment  of  three  separate  technical\n\n109.\ncommittees and finalization of a subsidiary loan agreement for the microcredit fund.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBefore  any  disbursement  is  made  for  the  development  facility  for  training\ninnovations, MLSP will finalize (a) the terms of reference and membership of the\ntechnical committee, (b) the criteria and procedures for screening and selecting\ninnovations  in  PVE  training,  and  (c)  procedures  for  availing  of  the  development\nfacility,  and  submit  these  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,  and  after  securing  ADB\nconcurrence, establish the committee.\nBefore  any  disbursement  is  made  for  the  development  facility  for  production\nactivities,  MLSP  will  finalize  (a)  the  terms  of  reference  and  membership  of  the\ntechnical committee, (b) the criteria and procedures for screening and selecting\nbusiness  plans,  and  (c)  procedures  for  availing  of  the  facility,  and  submit  the\nsame for ADB\u2019s concurrence, and after securing ADB concurrence, establish the\ncommittee.\nBefore  any  disbursement  is  made  from  the  microcredit  fund,  MLSP  will  finalize\nthe  terms  of  reference  and  membership  of  the  technical  committee  that  will\nreview and screen business plans and the criteria, and procedures for availing of\n\n\f34\n\n(iv) \n\nthe  microcredit  fund,  and  submit  the  same  for  ADB's  concurrence,  and  after\nsecuring ADB concurrence, establish the committee.\nBefore  any  disbursement  is  made  from  the  microcredit  fund,  MLSP,  in\nconsultation  with  MOF  and  SFSMB,  will  finalize  the  criteria  and  procedures  for\navailing  of  the  fund  in  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  (that  will  include  the\nestablishment  of  a  distinct  unit  within  SFSMB  to  implement  the  Project's\nmicrocredit  component  and  maintain  a  separate  accounting,  monitoring,  and\nreporting system for the microcredit component), and submit the same for ADB\u2019s\nconcurrence.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI

At  present,  most  primary  vocational  education  (PVE)  curricula  are  in  the\ntraditional Soviet form, highly specialized, and without much regard for labor market demand or\nflexibility  to  move  across  specializations.  While  the  Project  will  improve  the  quality  and\nrelevance of PVE curricula, there is an accompanying need to incorporate and/or disseminate\nthe successes of ongoing fragmented efforts to modernize and reorient curricula. Also, there is\na need to encourage and support appropriate training innovations. These innovations typically\noriginate  at  two  levels:  (i)  individuals,  usually  primary  vocational  education  institution  (PVEI)\ndirectors  and  teachers,  who  have  adapted  traditional  courses  to  local  demand,  and\n(ii) institutions  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  that  have  focused  on  skills  training\nand  entrepreneurship  development.  Furthermore,  it  is  expected  that  training  requirements  will\nchange as the country adapts to a market economy. To support existing work and requirements\nthat  may  emerge  during  project  implementation  and  were  not  anticipated  during  project\nprocessing, a development facility for training innovations will be incorporated into the Project.\n\nObjective.  This  facility  is  intended  to  support  (i)  development  of  existing  and  new\n2.\ntraining programs that may be given priority during project implementation, (ii) implementation of\nnew special training for specific beneficiary groups, (iii) innovations in training methodology, and\n(iv) development of new instructional materials or media.\n\n3.\nNature of the Facility. Funding will be provided for training innovations according to a\nproposal-approval-award  process.  Proposals  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  a  technical\ncommittee1 appointed by the minister of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and\nchaired  by  the  director  of  MLSP\u2019s  Department  for  Vocational  Training  and  Education  (DVTE).\nAwards  will  be  in  the  form  of  block  grants;  the  amount2  and  phasing  of  disbursements  will\ndepend on the proposal.\n\nCriteria  for  Evaluation  and  Award.  Evaluation  criteria  for  the  proposals  will  include\n4.\ntechnical  soundness  of  the  proposed  innovation,  relevance  to  priority  specializations,  use  of\nappropriate  technology,  development  and  implementation  costs,  beneficiary  coverage  and\nneeds,  potential  for  replication,  and  sustainability.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  to\nproponents  who  can  provide  counterpart  support  or  mobilize  community  or  local  government\nsupport.  DVTE  in  consultation  with  the  technical  committee  will  be  responsible  for  developing\nand submitting the detailed criteria for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concurrence, also as\na condition of disbursement.\n\nEligible  Participants.  The  facility  may  be  availed  of  by  PVE  institutions,  other\n\n5.\neducational institutions, NGOs, private employers, individuals, or groups.\n\n6.\nImplementation Arrangements. The funds for the facility will be disbursed according to\nguidelines  and  procedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  funds  will  be\nadministered by the project implementation unit (PIU) under the guidance of DVTE. Block grants\nwill  be  disbursed  in  a  phased  manner  according  to  monitorable  milestones  or  indicators  that\nmust be elaborated in the proposal. The PIU will conduct information campaigns in every oblast\nabout  the  availability  and  operating  policies  and  guidelines  of  the  fund.  Proposals  will  be\nreviewed  and  approved  quarterly.  The  deadlines  for  submitting  proposals  for  each  quarter  will\nbe set by the PIU in consultation with the technical committee.\n\n                                                \n1\n\nThis committee is envisaged to include representation from the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center,\nexperienced  PVEI  directors,  and  private  employers.  Subject-specific  experts  may  be  asked  to  advise  the\ncommittee as needed. The exact membership and specific terms of reference of the committee will be finalized\nduring project implementation, subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\nThe amount of each block grant may vary, and will be determined by the technical committee.\n\n2\n\n\fDEVELOPMENT FACILITY FOR PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\n\n49\n\nAppendix 8\n\nRationale.  As  public  budget  support  for  primary  vocational  education  (PVE)  has  been\n1.\ndiminishing, many primary vocational education institutions (PVEIs) have been successful in augmenting\ntheir budgets with income generated from production units and farms. At the same time, these production\nfacilities serve as venues for practical skills and entrepreneurship training for PVE students. The Project\nwill provide a development facility to support these production and entrepreneurship activities in PVEIs\nwhere they already exist, and assist other PVEIs in establishing similar production and entrepreneurship\nactivities to enhance their sustainability.\n\nObjective.  The  facility  is  intended  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  PVEIs  by  enhancing  their\n2.\nincome-generating capabilities through support for production and entrepreneurship activities, as well as\nenhance the practical skills and entrepreneurship training of students.\n\nNature  of  the  Facility.  Funding  will  be  provided  to  PVEIs  to  develop  new,  or  improve  existing,\n3.\nproduction facilities on the basis of business plans submitted by the PVEI directors. The business plans\nwill be reviewed and approved by a technical committee1 appointed by the Ministry of Labor and Social\nProtection  (MLSP),  and  chaired  by  the  director  of  MLSP\u2019s  Department  for  Vocational  Training  and\nEducation  (DVTE).  Awards  will  be  in  the  form  of  block  grants  and  the  amount2  and  phasing  of\ndisbursements will depend on the business plan.\n\n4.\nCriteria  for  Evaluation  and  Awards.  Business  plans  will  be  evaluated  on  a  competitive  basis\naccording  to  the  following  general  criteria:  rationale  and  justification  for  applying  for  a  block  grant,\ntechnical soundness, contribution to the PVEI\u2019s practical training program, and commitment of the PVEI\nto  sustain  a  revolving  fund  mechanism.  DVTE  in  consultation  with  the  technical  committee  will  be\nresponsible  for  developing  and  submitting  the  detailed  criteria  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nconcurrence, also as a condition of disbursement.\n\n5.\n\nEligible Participants. The facility may be availed of by model resource centers and PVEIs.\n\nImplementation  Arrangements.  The  funds  will  be  disbursed  according  to  guidelines  and\n6.\nprocedures  acceptable  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  funds  will  be  administered  by  the  project\nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  under  the  guidance  of  DVTE.  Block  grants  will  be  disbursed  in  a  phased\nmanner  according  to  measurable  milestones  or  indicators  that  should  be  elaborated  in  the  business\nplans. The PIU will disseminate operational policies and guidelines, as determined by DVTE, to all PVEIs\nbefore  implementation  of  the  facility.  PVEIs  will  finalize  their  business  plans  in  consultation  with  DVTE\nand submit them to the PIU. The business plans should include the rationale or justification for applying\nfor  a  block  grant,  implementation  plans,  monitoring  indicators,  the  planned  linkage  of  the  production\nfacilities  with  the  PVEI\u2019s  practical  training  programs,  and  a  commitment  by  the  PVEI  to  sustain  the\nrevolving fund that will be supported by the block grant. Proposals will be approved in two batches. The\nfirst batch will be for those PVEIs identified as model resource centers, and will be approved in time for\nimplementation starting fiscal year 2002. The second batch will be for the rest of the PVEIs, and will be\napproved in time for implementation starting fiscal year 2003. Proposals will be reviewed by the technical\ncommittee  in  consultation  with  DVTE.  After  initial  review,  the  technical  committee  may  request  further\nrefinements of the business plan relating to the proposal, and issue guidelines for negotiations between\nthe  PIU  and  the  PVEI  on  the  manner  of  implementation,  actual  amount  of  the  block  grant,  the\ndisbursement  schedule,  and  the  sustaining  of  the  revolving  fund.  During  implementation,  the  recipient\nPVEI will submit semiannual progress and financial reports for audit purposes.\n\n                                                \n1\n\nIt is envisaged that this committee will include experienced PVEI directors who have successful production activities in their\ninstitutions.  Representatives  from  the  local  community  and  private  business  and  industry  may  be  asked  to  advise  the\ncommittee as needed. The exact membership and specific terms of reference of the committee will be finalized during project\nimplementation subject to ADB concurrence, as a condition of disbursement.\n\n2 The  size  of  each  block  grant  may  vary  according  to  the  business  plan  submitted  and  will  be  determined  by  the  technical\ncommittee in consultation with DVTE. It is estimated that each PVE institution may receive a total block grant ranging from\n$5,000 to $15,000.\n\n\f50\n\nMICROCREDIT FUND\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nAn essential complementary strategy for entrepreneurship development is the provision\n1.\nof  accessible  and  appropriate  credit  to  potential  entrepreneurs  who  have  undergone  skills\ntraining  and  practiced  or  apprenticed  in  actual  business  activities.  The  Project  needed  such  a\ncomplementary scheme for the graduates of the primary vocational education (PVE) system. To\nidentify  a  suitable  microcredit  mechanism  for  the  Project,  a  review  of  nine  existing  microcredit\ndelivery  programs1  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  how  they  addressed  the  credit  needs  of\nmicroentrepreneurs was carried out. Roundtable discussions were held with primary vocational\neducation institution (PVEI) directors to determine the feasibility of linking training programs to a\nmicrocredit scheme for graduates.\n\n2.\nMost  existing  credit  schemes  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  supported  by  aggressive\ndevelopment activities usually funded by external sources; administrative and support cost are\noften  several  times  larger  than  the  actual  amount  lent  to  the  borrowers.  The  development\nassistance is meant to create suitable and viable social and institutional infrastructure, as well\nas assist with legal and regulatory aspects, to enable the microcredit scheme to be sustainable.\nExperiences  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  show  a  generally  high  repayment  rate  among  borrowers,\nespecially if denominated in som, but greater difficulty in repayment among those who borrowed\nin  equivalent  foreign  currency.  The  developing  nature  of  the  country\u2019s  financial  infrastructure\ncoupled  with  highly  volatile  inflation  rates2  are  the  weak  links,  and  contribute  to  high  cost  of\nadministering the credit scheme, resulting in high interest rates to the borrowers.\n\n3.\nAdequate  and  reliable  information  is  not  available  for  a  rigorous  demand  and  supply\nanalysis  of  credit  for  microentrepreneurs.  However,  information  from  focus  discussion  groups\ninvolving  entrepreneurs  conducted  during  project  preparation  indicates  that  the  absorptive\ncapacity  for  microcredit  for  such  purposes  is  large,  particularly  in  the  informal  labor  market\nwhere small businesses operate. The two major issues mentioned by entrepreneurs interviewed\nwere  the  lack  of  financing  sources  and  the  prevailing  difficult  environment,  in  particular,\ncumbersome red tape and an onerous tax code. On the supply side, with the exception of the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  scheme  for  Loan  1529(SF)-KGZ,  which  only  requires\nmembership  in  a  credit  union  to  qualify  for  a  loan,3  other  microcredit  schemes  reviewed  have\nspecific target groups of beneficiaries, e. g., agricultural loans, loans for rural women, loans for\npoor  self-help  groups  as  identified  by  volunteers,  or  registered  unemployed.  Also,  some\nmicrocredit  schemes  are  limited  to  geographic  areas  (e.g.,  targeting  the  poorer  or  southern\noblasts). To provide entrepreneur graduates equal opportunity for credit, a microcredit fund will\nbe piloted under the Project.\n\n                                                \n1  Schemes  examined  included  those  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Loan  No.  1529(SF)-KGZ:  Rural Financial\nInstitutions,  for  $12.5  million,  approved  on  21  August  1997;  two  World  Bank-funded  projects  with  the  Kyrgyz\nAgricultural  Finance  Corporation,  Mercy  Corps  International  supported  by  the  United  States  Department  of\nAgriculture;  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development-funded  Foundation  for  International\nCommunity Assistance, the State Fund for Support of Small and Medium Business (SFSMB); and the microcredit\ncenters of the Department of Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.\n\n2  Inflation  rate  estimates  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  have  been  changing  rapidly.  The  inflation  rate  for  1999  was\nestimated  at  about  41  percent  per  annum.  At  appraisal  (June  2000),  the  inflation  rate  estimate  was  fluctuating\nbetween 27 to 30 percent per annum but has since dropped to about 15 percent per annum.\n\n3  Project-trained  entrepreneurs  would  not  be  ready  to  join  credit  unions  outright  because  of  the  membership\n\nrequirements but could be expected to join such unions after accumulating some savings.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nThe prerequisites for a desirable microcredit scheme for the Project are (i) it should be\n4.\naccessible to the target beneficiaries (i.e., the potential entrepreneurs among PVEI graduates);\n(ii)  it  should  provide  credit  at  real  lending  rates  without  subsidy;  (iii)  it  should  be  efficiently\nadministered to be relatively affordable compared with other schemes; (iv) it should add value to\nor  further  the  technology  of  microcredit  management  and  institutional  infrastructure;  and  (v)  if\npossible,  it  should  not  develop  a  new  scheme  but  instead  avail  of  an  existing  microcredit\nmechanism. \nfollowing  criteria  were  applied:\n(i) sustainability  of  the  financial  intermediary,  (ii)  sustainability  of  the  microcredit  scheme,  and\n(iii) flexibility of collateral requirements.\n\nthese  considerations, \n\nIn  addition \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nfound \n\nto  be \n\nfinancial \n\nthe  most  appropriate \n\nAmong various alternatives evaluated, the State Fund for Support of Small and Medium\n5.\nBusiness  (SFSMB)  was \nfor\nimplementing  the  Project's  microcredit  fund  (Appendix  10  includes  institutional  details  on\nSFSMB). SFSMB has a functioning management structure for fund management, experience in\nconducting  commercial  and  financial  viability  appraisal,  and  trained  staff  to  monitor  loan\nrepayments and collection at the oblast level. Furthermore, SFSMB has an ongoing partnership\n(UNDP)-assisted  Small  Business\nwith \nDevelopment  Center  (SBDC)  using  an  integrated  business  center  approach.  Advisory  units  of\nSBDC  in  each  oblast  will  be  able  to  support  and  advise  borrowers  on  their  business  planning\nand  operations  as  well  as  assist  SFSMB  (on  a  fee  basis)  to  assess  loan  applications  and\nmonitor  loan  performance.  SFSMB  will  accept  both  physical  and  social  collateral  under  the\nscheme.\n\nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n\nintermediary \n\nB.\n\nThe Microcredit Fund\n\n1.\n\nUnderlying Principles\n\n6.\n\nThe microcredit scheme will follow the underlying working principles:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe scheme should work within the policy framework and development strategies\nof the Project and should be consistent with ADB's microfinance strategy.4\nThe multisectoral project steering committee will provide overall policy guidelines\nin  project  implementation,  while  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  provide  policy\ndirection  and  general  guidelines  on  funding  mechanisms  of  the  microcredit\nscheme and operations.\nThe Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) through the Department for\nVocational  Training  and  Education  (DVTE)  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall\nsuccess of the Project, with SFSMB as the responsible financial intermediary for\nthe implementation of the microcredit component. Thus, overall coordination and\nmonitoring of all project activities, including microcredit, will be the responsibility\nof DVTE.\nSFSMB will also be responsible for the appraisal and approval of endorsed credit\napplications, loan disbursements, and collection of repayments, and arranging for\nadvisory financial services to the subborrowers.\n\n2.\n\nOnlending Terms\n\n7.\nADB  will  lend  to  the Government  $1 million  equivalent  in  foreign  exchange  for  the\nmicrocredit    component.

The interest rate to\nbe charged by MOF will be a fluctuating rate equal to the inflation rate prevailing at the time of\nonlending plus the risk insurance charges assumed by MOF. The term of onlending would be 20\nyears including a 7-year grace period. Penalty fees would be at 0.2 percent per annum. SFSMB\nwould pay back the principal plus interest semiannually.\n\nSFSMB  will  onlend  in  som  to  individual  subborrowers  and/or  groups  of  subborrowers,\n\n8.\nunder the following conditions:\n\nThe maximum amount of a single loan will be the som equivalent of $1,000.\nThe  maximum  lending  term  (repayment  period)  will  be  2  years.  In  general,  the\nrepayment period will depend on the type of business.\nThe  lending  rate  will  be  MOF's  interest  rate  (para.  7)  plus  a  margin  to  cover\nSFSMB's administrative costs, service fees, and provision for bad debts.6\nEach  loan  will  be  governed  by  a  written  contract  between  SFSMB  and  the\nsubborrower that will specify the repayment schedule, grace period (if any), and\npenalty fees for late repayments.\n\n3.\n\nRequirements for Subborrowers\n\nBefore  a  subborrower  or  group  of  subborrowers  can  avail  of  a  loan,  the  following\n\n9.\nrequirements must be fulfilled:\n\nThe  subborrower  will  be  either  a  graduate  or  a  student  in  good  standing  in  a\nPVEI.\nThe  subborrower  will  submit  an  acceptable  and  viable  business  plan  in  the\nproper format.\nThe  subborrower  will  undergo  the  required  borrower  training  to  be  provided  by\nSFSMB or its training representatives.\nThe subborrower will pass SFSMB's credit investigation.\nThe subborrower should have appropriate collateral as determined by SFSMB\n(social collateral may be allowed depending on circumstances).\n\n4. \n\nStep-by-step Procedures\n\n10.\n\nThe following procedures will apply.\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v)\n\n(i) \n\nApplicants  will  submit  business  plans  in  the  required  format  to  a  technical\ncommittee  comprising  officials  of  DVTE  and  selected  PVEI  directors  who  have\nsubstantial  technical  experience  in  appraising  business  plans.  In  this  respect,\nadvice  will  be  available  from  the  UNDP-assisted  SBDC  and  its  branch  offices.7\nSince  the  technical  committee  will  be  based  in  Bishkek,  applications  may  be  in\nfax or electronic form, to enable quick processing of oblast level applications.\n\n                                                \n5 Onlending will be done in a phased manner as agreed to by SFSMB, MLSP, and ADB.\n6 With the current estimate of the annual inflation rate at about 15 percent, plus MOF estimates of its risk insurance\ncharge at about 2-4 percent, plus SFSMB's present margin of 7 percent, the Project's Microcredit Fund would now\nhave a lending rate of about 25 percent. This is consistent with SFSMB's current charges of 25-45 percent interest\non its loans depending on the individual circumstances surrounding each loan.\n\n7 The SBDCs provide a range of services from advice on preparation of business plans, borrower training, organizing\nof workshops, and monitoring of loans. See also para. 3 of Appendix 10 for a description of cooperation between\nSFSMB and SBDC.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nThe  technical  committee  will  screen  the  applications  and  submit  a  longlist  of\nacceptable business plans to the corresponding regional office of SFSMB, where\nthe  applicant  resides.  The  regional  office  will  decide,  according  to  SFSMB's\nprocessing procedures, which applications in the longlist will be accepted.\nThe  accepted  applicant  completes  the  required  loan  documentation  with  the\nassistance of SFSMB's technical staff at the regional office.\nAfter  all  requirements  are  fulfilled,  the  loan  is  released  by  the  regional  office  of\nSFSMB in the form of bank transfer.\nMonitoring of loans and collection of repayments will be the responsibility of\nSFSMB.\n\n11.\n\nThe flowchart of the proposed Microcredit Fund is shown below.\n\n5.\n\nUndertakings by DVTE and SFSMB\n\nThe following will be undertaken by DVTE and SFSMB to ensure proper implementation\n\n12.\nof the loan:\n\nBefore  any  part  of  the  Project's  microcredit  component  is  disbursed,  DVTE  will\nestablish  the  technical  committee  described  above  (para.  10[i])  to  review  and\nscreen  business  plans.  The  terms  of  reference  and  membership  of  the\ncommittee, and the criteria for accepting business plans for onward endorsement\nto SFSMB will be subject to ADB concurrence.\nBefore  any  part  of  the  Microcredit  Fund  is  disbursed,  SFSMB  will  establish  a\ndistinct unit8 at the central level for microcredit of PVEI graduates and students.\nThe terms of reference of that unit will be subject to ADB concurrence.\nThe first 10 microcredit applications will be reviewed jointly with ADB before final\napproval.\nSFSMB  will  maintain  separate  accounting  for  the  microcredit  component  and\nsubmit  a  quarterly  status  report  to  DVTE  and  ADB  (in  English)  on  loans  and\nrepayments.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                \n8  This  separate  unit  will  serve  a  dual  purpose:  to  maintain  separate  recording  and  monitoring  for  the  Project\ncomponent and to pilot improvements on SFSMB's current (Soviet) style of record keeping and financial reporting.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nFigure A9: Flowchart of the Microcredit Fund\n\nADB\n\nMOF\n\nNBKR\n\nPSC\n\nDVTE\n\nSFSMB\n\nPVEIs\n\nBusiness\nAdvisors\n\nSubborrowers/beneficiaries\nPotential entrepreneurs among PVEI\ngraduates\n\nLEGEND:\n               Funds flow ($)\n               Funds flow (Som)\n               Decision/Policy flow\n\nADB\nDVTE\n\nMOF\nNBKR\nPSC\nPVEI\nSFSMB\n\nAsian Development Bank\nDepartment for Vocational Training and Education under the Ministry of Labor\nand Social Protection\nMinistry of Finance\nNational Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic\nproject steering committee\nprimary vocational education institution\nState Fund for Support to Small and Medium Business\n\n\fSTATE FUND FOR SUPPORT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS\n\n55\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nA. \n\nLegal Status and Mandate\n\n1.\nThe  State  Fund  for  Support  of  Small  and  Medium  Business  (SFSMB)  was  established  by\nPresidential  decree  on  23  August  1991  as  the  National  Entrepreneurship  Fund,  later  renamed  the\nFund for Development of Entrepreneurship in the Kyrgyz Republic, and finally SFSMB. It is a nonprofit\nstate agency with a mandate to provide state support to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)\nby means of financing, training, consultative and informational advice, and other services as needed\nby SMEs.\n\n2.\nThe  main  objectives  of  SFSMB  include  (i)  participate  in  the  implementation  of  Government\nprograms  and  projects  aimed  at  SME  development,  (ii)  mobilize  foreign  and  domestic  resources  for\nSME support, (iii) provide credit to SMEs using its own funds as well as provide assistance to SMEs\nto  obtain  credit  from  other  sources,  (iv)  create  support  services  for  SMEs  on  a  fee  basis  such  as\ntraining  and  business  advisory  centers,  and  (v)  assist  in  creating  a  legal  environment  favorable  to\nSME development. Income from economic activities, interest on loans, as well as property received by\nSFSMB  are  not  taxable,  remain  with  SFSMB,  and  are  directed  to  the  realization  of  its  objectives.\nSFSMB  is  accountable  to  the  Government  through  the  Office  of  the  First  Deputy  Prime  Minister\nresponsible for economics and industry.\n\nB. \n\nOrganization and Operation\n\n3.\nThe organization chart of SFSMB is shown in Figure A10. SFSMB is based in Bishkek and has\nfive  regional  offices  (in  Jalal-Abad,  Yssyk  Kul,  Naryn,  Osh,  and  Talas  oblasts),  two  representative\noffices  (in  Kemin  and  Toktogul  raions),  and  a  business  incubator  in  Jayil  raion.  The  total  staffing\n(excluding the chairperson and deputy chairperson) is 24 technical staff and 11 support staff. Lending\noperations  are  fully  delegated  to  regional  offices  for  loans  amounting  to  less  than  Som100,000.\nBeyond that amount, loan applications are endorsed to the head office in Bishkek, usually by fax, and\nacted upon by a credit commission that meets weekly. Channeling of funds to the regional offices is\ndone through commercial banks (if available) or branches of the Savings and Settlement Company,1\nwhich has an extensive network of rural branches and post offices to reach remote areas.\n\n4.\nIn  addition  to  the  foregoing  lending  activities,  SFSMB  cooperates  closely  with  the  United\nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  assisted  Small  Business  Development  Center  (SBDC),\nwhich provides technical assistance (advisory and training services) through a network of integrated\nbusiness  centers  in  Bishkek,  and  in  Jalal-Abad,  Yssyk  Kul,  Naryn,  Osh,  and  Talas  oblasts.  This\ncooperation  with  integrated  business  centers  was  established  by  Government  resolution2  in  1998.\nUnder the resolution, an integrated business center is tasked to provide the full range of services to\nsupport SMEs, and SFSMB has a tripartite arrangement with SBDC and local chapters of the Kyrgyz\nTrade  and  Industry  Chamber.  The  regional  offices  of  SFSMB  provide  financial  support  to  SMEs\nthrough  loans  in  priority  areas  such  as  agriprocessing;  production  of  food,  industrial,  and  general\nconsumption  goods;  manufacturing  of  export-oriented  goods,  processing  of  local  raw  materials;\nemployment  generation;  and  implementation  of  new  technologies.  SBDC  provides  the  consultative-\ntraining  component  and  the  local  chapters  of  the  Kyrgyz  Trade  and  Industry  Chamber  provide  the\ninformation  component.  This  integrated  approach  will  be  used  to  support  the  subborrowers  of  the\nProject\u2019s microcredit component.\n\nC.\n\nFinancial and Microcredit Experience\n\nRigorous  analysis  of  SFSMB's  financial  statements  is  constrained  by  the  fact  that  they  have\n5.\nnot been prepared according to internationally accepted accounting standards. Being a state agency\n\n                                                \n1 \n\nThe Savings and Settlement Company is a national savings institution established in 1996 by the National Bank of the\nKyrgyz Republic primarily to provide savings and money shop services to rural areas.\n\n2  Resolution No. 206, approved on 21 April 1998.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nand  subject  to  Parliament  audit,  SFSMB  has  been  following  the  standard  prescribed  format  of\naccounting carried over from Soviet times.3\n\n6.\nSFSMB  has  two  major  sources  of  income,  namely,  3  percent  of  the  net  proceeds  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s privatization program and income from SFSMB\u2019s lending operations.4 SFSMB does not\nreceive any allocation from either republican or local budgets. About a quarter of SFSMB\u2019s income is\nused  for  salaries  and  bonuses,  and  administrative  and  operational  expenditures;  the  balance  is\nchanneled  back  to  lending.  Table  A10.1  summarizes  SFSMB\u2019s  income  and  expenditures  for  1998,\n1999, and the first seven months of 2000.\n\nTable A10.1: SFSMB's Income and Expenditures, 1998-2000\n(Som \u2018000)\n\n Item\n\nA.

Thus,  calculation  of  a  subsidy  dependency  index5  is  not  possible.  SFSMB's  reliance  on\nexternal  funding  (the  privatization  proceeds  are  the  major  source),  seen  as  a  percentage  of  total\ninflows,  declined  from  95  percent  when  it  started  in  1992  to  51  percent  in  1994,  increased  to  84\npercent in 1996, and thereafter, steadily declined to 27 percent in 1999, reflecting the irregular pattern\nof  privatization  proceeds.6  Regardless  of  this  fluctuation,  SFSMB's  income  from  lending  operations\ncan sustain its operational and administrative expenditures even if privatization proceeds slow down\nor stop completely.\n\n8.\nSFSMB  started  lending  operations  in  1992.  During  its  first  full  year  of  lending  operations\n(1993), SFSMB lent a total of Som2.5 million. Its lending level has since been increasing steadily and,\nin 1999, total loans amounted to Som13.8 million (an average annual increase of about 33 percent).\nTable A10.2 shows SFSMB\u2019s lending experience since 1998.\n\n4 \n\n                                                \n3  However,  subloans  under  the  Project's  microcredit  component  will  be  recorded  and  accounted  for  separately  using\ninternationally accepted accounting standards. In this respect, the Project's piloting of a microcredit component serves\nalso as a pilot for SFSMB to move to internationally accepted accounting standards.\nIncome from lending operations include repayment of interest on loans, fees for collateral inspection, penalties on late\nrepayments, and a maximum of 7 percent margin for other administrative costs.\nSuch  as  that  discussed  in  Yaron,  J.  1995.  Assessing Development Finance Institutions - A Public Interest Analysis.\nWorld Bank Discussion Paper, World Bank, Washington, DC.\nIn  the  first  seven  months  of  2000,  SFSMB  has  enjoyed  a  surge  in  privatization  proceeds  owing  to  a  large  inflow  of\nSom7.5 million in June 2000.\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n                1998                \nAmount\nNumber\n(Som \u2018000)\n\nTable A10.2: Loans Provided by SFSMB\n\n                1999                \nAmount\nNumber\n(Som \u2018000)\n4,627.0\n2,898.0\n1,343.4\n810.0\n1,777.0\n1,396.5\n922.0\n13,773.9\n\n35\n42\n28\n9\n20\n21\n27\n182\n\n75.7\n\n4,248.2\n1,635.0\n1,744.0\n1,256.3\n500.0\n1,115.0\n745.7\n11,244.2\n\n142.3\n\n      2000 (Jan-Jul)      \n\nNumber\n\n32\n21\n7\n3\n9\n18\n10\n100\n\nAmount\n(Som \u2018000)\n3,295.0\n1,515.0\n1,053.0\n250.0\n519.0\n993.0\n685.0\n8,310.0\n\n83.1\n\nBishkek\nChui\nJalal-Abad\nYssyk Kul\nOsh\nNaryn\nTalas\nTotal\nAverage  Loan\nSize\n\n14\n14\n15\n10\n1\n15\n10\n79\n\nSFSMB  provides  loans7  to  individuals  and  businesses  up  to  a  maximum  of  Som500,000,\n9.\nalthough the average loan amount  hovers around Som80,000. The interest rate has fluctuated from\n25 to 45 percent depending on the type of business and on whether the loan is short (less than one\nyear)  or  long  term  (up  to  five  years).  If  an  entrepreneur  has  had  good  repayment  experience  with\nSFSMB, future loans may be given more favorable lending terms. Repayment of principal and interest\nare  usually  due  quarterly.  Collateral8  is  required  for  all  types  of  loans  at  present;  however,  for  the\nProject\u2019s  microcredit  component,  SFSMB  officials  have  agreed  to  consider  social  collateral  (e.g.,\nguarantees by peer groups or respected individuals).\n\nSFSMB's  repayment  rate9  experience  is  as  follows:  1998,  76.1  percent;  1999,  71.2 percent;\n10.\nand 2000 (January to June), 86.7 percent. These repayment rates are lower than desirable compared\nwith  other  microcredit  experience  in  other  countries.  However,  this  is  in  large  part  due  to  the\ncomparative  newness  of  savings  and  credit  concepts  to  the  general  population  and  the  relatively\nunstable banking situation. The improvement in repayment performance during 2000 can be attributed\nto  a  combination  of  tightening  up  of  collateral  requirements  and  improved  borrower  training  and\nbusiness  advice  given  by  the  recently  established  integrated  business  centers,  which  are  specific\nstrategies undertaken by SFSMB to improve their lending operations.\n\n11. With its present level of staffing, SFSMB has an average loan processing time of about three\nweeks  (assuming  the  application  papers  are  completely  and  correctly  filled  out).  Typically,  the  first\nweek  is  spent  on  advising  and  assisting  the  borrower  to  prepare  a  business  plan,  and  orienting  the\nborrower to SFSMB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. The second week is spent on helping the borrower\nto complete the loan documentation and submit it to the credit commission.\n\nIn 1999, SFSMB provided loans for 182 projects and, in the first seven months of 2000, 100\n12.\nprojects. SFSMB estimates that an average of 50-60 more applications per year are declined mainly\nbecause of lack  of collateral, nonfeasibility of the project, and lack of facilities and entrepreneurship\nskills among the applicants. At present, SFSMB has 413 applications pending (including those in the\nregional  offices)  for  a  total  of  Som120  million.  Given  SFSMB\u2019s  experience  and  the  recently\nestablished  integrated  business  centers  (that  would  reduce  SFSMB\u2019s  advisory-training  function  in\nfavor  of  lending),  SFSMB  is  institutionally  capable  of  processing  more  loans.  The  limiting  factor\nappears to be lack of funds.\n\n                                                \n7 \n\n8 \n\nLoans  fall  into  three  categories:  financial  (for  working  capital),  technical  (for  facilities  and  equipment  purchase),  and\nleasing.\nPresent  collateral  requirements  are  as  follows:  financial  loan,  125-150  percent  of  loan  amount;  technical  loan,\n80 percent of loan amount (acquired equipment may be used as collateral); leasing loan, 25-30 percent of the amount of\nthe leasing transaction.\n\n9  Repayment rate is calculated as a percentage of the total som amount actually repaid for those loans and interest that\n\nfell due during the given period.\n\n\fFigure A10: Organization of SFSMB\n\nChairperson\n\nDeputy Chairperson\n\nCredit Management Department\n(Head)\n\nAdvisor1\n\nAccounting Unit (2)\nAudit Unit (3)\nFinance and Economics Unit (2)\nLegal Unit (3)\n\nAdministrative \nManagement Department  \n(Head plus 2 technical staff \nplus 5 support staff)\n\nRegional and Representative Offices, \nBusiness Incubator (Total of 22 Staff--\nTypical Staffing: director and chief \naccountant plus one additional expert in \neach regional office)\n\n \n5\n8\n\n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n0\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n4\n\nRepayment Unit (3)\n\nUnit for Long-\nTerm Credit (2)\n\nUnit for Short-Term Loans and \nMicrocredit (2)\n\n___________________________________\n1\n\nThe present adviser is concurrently the chief technical adviser of the United Nations Development Programme-assisted Small Business Development Center.\n\n\fORGANIZATIONAL CHART OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION\n\n59\n\nAppendix 11\n\nSteering Committee 1\n\n       Project Director\n\n     Project Manager\n       (Bishkek PIU)\n\n          Project\n     Consultants\n\n          Project\n      Coordinator\n    (Osh  Sub-PIU)\n\nConsultant Services/\nStaff Development\n           Officer\n\nConsultant Services/\nStaff Development\n           Officer\n\n        Civil Works/\n       Procurement\n           Officer\n\n         Finance/\n    Administrative\n          Officer\n\n_________________\n\n1\n\n      Civil Works/\n      Procurement\n          Officer\n\n         Finance/\n    Administrative\n          Officer\n\nComprising the minister of labor and social protection (chairperson), the project director (secretary) and\nappropriate  representation  from  various  stakeholder  groups  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Education,\nScience, and Culture; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade; State Committee for\nForeign Investments and Economic Development (Goscominvest); State Fund for Support of Small and\nMedium Business; other government agencies as needed; private sector (e.g., Chamber of Commerce\nof the Kyrgyz Republic); and nongovernment organizations.\n\n\fSUMMARY OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT\n\nComponent/Subcomponent\n\nDescription\n\nCategory Duration\n(weeks)\n\nParticipants\n(Beneficiaries)\n\n         Total         \nPerson-\nmonth\n\nNumber and Source of Participants\nOther\nMLSP\n\n         PVEI         \n\nNo. Model/\n\nVTE\n(incl.\nPIU) Agencies Officials\n\nPrivate or\nLocal\n\nRC\n\nOther\n\nI.

The  enabling  environment  needs  to  be  improved  by  establishing\ninstitutional  infrastructure  such  appropriate  legislation  and  taxation  and  supporting/providing\nsustained  advocacy  and  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC)  campaigns  for\nstakeholders and the community at large.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\n2.\nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  the  Government,  particularly  the  Ministry  of\nLabor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  to  develop  a  medium-  to  long-term  strategic  policy\nframework  and  action  plans  for  skills  and  entrepreneurship  development.  The  TA  will  help\nMLSP  identify,  formulate,  and  advocate  appropriate  policy  and  legislative  reforms  that  will\nenable the PVE system to be more responsive to changing labor market requirements.\n\n3.\nThe  TA  will  facilitate  the  development  of  an  explicit  vision  and  mission  statement  for\nskills  and  entrepreneurship  development,  taking  into  account  international  and  Central  Asian\nperspectives,  the  country\u2019s  comparative  advantage,  and  available  human  and  economic\nresources.  This  will  involve  internal  and  external  scanning  of  the  country\u2019s  (and  MLSP\u2019s)\nstrengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  to  evolve  a  strategic  framework  and  action\nplans, including identification of policy and legislative agenda to implement them.\n\n4.\nThe  resulting  strategic  framework  and  action  plans  will  be  discussed  and  refined  in  a\nnational consultative workshop that will be facilitated by a panel of international authorities and\nexperts. The recommendations of that workshop will be followed up to the development of draft\nlegislation  and  policy  pronouncements  for  the  consideration  of  the  Government.  The  TA  will\ndevelop IEC strategies for social marketing of approved action plans.\n\nD.\n\nConsultant Requirements\n\n5.\nThe  TA  will  require  three  international  consultants:  a  strategic  planner  for  economic\ndevelopment  (3  person-months),  human  development  specialist  (3  person-months),  and\nlegislation specialist (3 person-months). These international consultants will work in cooperation\nwith  four  local  consultants:  a  strategic  planner  for  economic  development  (6  person-months),\nhuman development specialist (6 person-months), legislation specialist (3 person-months), and\nIEC and media specialist (3 person-months). The TA will engage three renowned authorities in\nstrategic planning, human development, and skills and entrepreneurship development to serve\nas a panel of experts in a national consultative workshop.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 21, page 2\n\nE.\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n6.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $742,000  equivalent,  comprising  $464,000  in\nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $278,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  financing  from  Japan  Special  Fund  for  $600,000\nequivalent to cover all of the foreign costs and $136,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.\nThe  Government  will  provide  the  balance  of  $142,000  equivalent,  mostly  in  kind,  which  will\ncover the cost of counterpart staff and workshop participants (remuneration, per diem, and local\ntravel  expenses),  support  staff;  office  facilities;  utilities;  supplies;  and  preparation,  translation,\nand reproduction of documents. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in\nTable A21.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n7.\nThe Executing Agency for the TA will be MLSP though DVTE. The director of DVTE will\nadminister the TA and oversee the work of the consulting team. The team will work under the\nguidance of the project steering committee that has been established for the Project.\n\nAn international consulting firm will be engaged for the TA according to ADB Guidelines\n8.\non the Use of Consultants. The  team  will  gather  preliminary  information  through  minisurveys\nand discussions with stakeholders. Thereafter, a visioning workshop will be convened, bringing\ntogether senior-level government officials who have a policy role in skills and entrepreneurship\ndevelopment. After two follow-up workshops to cover other parts of the country (one in Bishkek\ncovering  the  northern  oblasts  and  one  in  Osh  covering  the  southern  oblasts),  a  national\nconsultative  workshop,  in  which  the  panel  of  international  authorities  will  participate,  will  be\nconvened  to  present  and  discuss  the  results  of  the  previous  workshops.  Thereafter,  the  team\nwill develop legislative recommendations at a legislative workshop.\n\nThe TA should be implemented within six months. The first workshop will be convened\n9.\nwithin two weeks after the start of the TA. The national consultative workshop will be held about\nthe  fourth  month  of  the  TA.  ADB  missions  will  be  scheduled  to  allow  ADB  input  at  both\nworkshops.\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 21, page 3\n\nTable A21: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ '000)\n\nForeign\n\nLocal\n\nExchange Currency\n\nTotal\n\nCost\n\nItem\n\nA.
