Environmental  implications  of  the  proposed  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms  were  reviewed  and  environmental  interventions \nincorporated, as required. \n \nAgriculture accounts for 39% of the national gross domestic product \n(GDP), and employs about 70% of the total workforce. Rural income \nis  primarily  generated  from  agriculture,  which  is  dominated  by  rice \nproduction.  Despite  the  importance  and  potential  of  agriculture,  its \ngrowth during the 1990s has been sluggish and has widely fluctuated \ndue  to  its  heavy  dependence  on  rain-fed  rice  cultivation.  The \ncountry\u2019s  average  rice  yield  was  estimated  at  2.1  tons  per  hectare \n(ha)  in  2001,  the  lowest  in  Southeast  Asia.  During  the  First \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDPI, 1996\u20132000), the average \ngrowth  of  agriculture  was  less  than  3.0%  per  annum  (with  high \nvariability), which was far below the plan target of 5.2% per annum, \nand had no substantial impact on poverty reduction in rural areas. \n \nWith  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the \nGovernment implemented the first Agriculture Sector Program (ASP, \nlegislation, \n1996\u20132000), \nagricultural \nfinance,  public \nenterprises,  and  decentralization.  Although  ASP  was  generally \nsuccessful,  the  Government  recognizes  that  the  reform  measures \nintroduced  under  ASP  needed  deepening  to  accelerate  agricultural \ngrowth. Regulations for the Land Law, enacted in August 2001, need \nto  be  prepared  and  implemented.  In  keeping  with  the  goals  of \nreorienting  public  agencies  and  promoting  private  sector's  role, \nfurther  progress  in  divestment  of  state-owned  public  enterprises  is \nwarranted.  New  regulations  and  regulatory  capacity  must  be \ndeveloped  to  maintain  the  quality  and  safety  of  agricultural  inputs \ntraded in the market. Further efforts are also required to improve the \npolicy  and \nthe  Government's \nadministrative capacities that will promote private sector participation \nin  the  agriculture  sector,  particularly  in  marketing  and  financial \nservices,  and  training  and  education.  To  remove  knowledge  and \ntechnology  constraints  on  agricultural  productivity,  the  Government \nmust  continue  to  improve  the  skills  and  resources  of  the  national \nsystem for agricultural research and extension.  \n \nUnder  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII, \n2001\u20132005),  the  Government  aims  to  transform  agriculture  into  a \ndriving force to improve economic growth and reduce poverty  within \na  market-oriented  policy \nframework  by  promoting  agricultural \ncommercialization  and  diversification.  In  line  with  SEDPII,  the \nGovernment  wishes  to  continue,  with  ADB's  assistance,  its  policy \n\ninstitutional  environment,  and \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nto  address \n\nincluding \n\nreforms \n\ninputs, \n\nrural \n\nrural \n\nland \n\n\fiii \n\nissues \n\nrestricting \n\nresolving  critical \n\nGovernment  wishes  to  continue,  with  ADB's  assistance,  its  policy \nand  institutional  reform  measures  and  expand  opportunities  in  the \nsector  by \nthe  sector's \nperformance, including (i) limited access to productive resources and \nimproved  agricultural  inputs  due  to  weak  regulatory  systems,  (ii) \nuncertainty  in  the  market  environment  for  private  agro-based \nenterprise  growth,  (iii)  lack  of  resources  for  effective  agricultural \nresearch  and  extension  services \nto  promote  commercialized \nagriculture,  and  (iv)  weak  capacity  and  resources  at  agricultural \ninstitutions. \n \nOne  of  the  three  priority  areas  in  ADB's  country  strategy  for \nCambodia  is  to  promote  rural  economic  development,  thereby \ncontributing to the ultimate goal of poverty reduction. ADB's strategy \nfor  Cambodia's  agriculture  sector  is  to  help  achieve  the  SEDPII's \nobjectives  by  increasing  agricultural  productivity.  ADB  also  aims  to \npromote  private  sector  participation  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and \nincrease  awareness  and  knowledge  among  the  rural  poor,  women, \nand vulnerable groups to help them participate in overall agricultural \ndevelopment  and  to  gain  better  access  to  productive  opportunities. \nThe Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) is required to \nimplement these ADB strategies.  Complementarity and synergy with \nprojects  and  programs  of  ADB  and  other  external  funding  agencies \nwere fully considered during loan processing of ASDP. \n \n\nimpact  on \n\nto  promote  sustainable  growth  of  market-based \nagriculture  and  improve  agricultural  productivity.  ASDP  will  be \nimplemented  within  the  framework  of  SEDPII  and  will  (i)  improve \nability  of  smallholders  to  raise  productivity  and  diversify  into  high-\nvalue products; (ii) improve the market environment for private agro-\nbased enterprise growth; and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity for \ncompetitive  agricultural  commercialization.  ASDP  will  also  promote \nincreased  participation  of  the  poor  and  women  in  agricultural \nproduction, marketing, and post-production. \n \nSocial and environmental issues considered under ASDP include (i) \nsocial \nthe  rural  poor  and  vulnerable;  (ii)  gender \nmainstreaming  in  agricultural  development;  (iii)  supply  and  use  of \nagrochemicals; and (iv) efficient use of natural resources. Social and \nenvironmental  assessments  have  been  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB's guidelines. In conjunction with ASDP, ADB has provided \na  grant  assistance  project  under  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction to support nongovernment organization (NGO) activities in \nthe poverty-stricken areas in southern Cambodia to enhance ASDP's \nimpact  on  rural  poverty  reduction  based  on  a  partnership  between \nthe  Government  and  NGOs.  ADB's  operational  experience  in \nCambodia  indicates  that  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  must  be \ninvolved  in  formulating  and  implementing  development  activities. \nADB  conducted  a  series  of  stakeholder  consultations  during  the \nformulation  and  processing  of  ASDP.  ADB  will  ensure  continued \nconsultation with key stakeholders during ASDP implementation. \n\n \nObjectives and Scope   ASDP  aims \n\n \nSocial and  \nEnvironmental Issues \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n \n\nObjective and \nScope \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\nProgram \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\nExecuting \nAgencies and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nThe Project Loan \n \n\nObjective and \nScope \n\n(iii) \n\nrationalizing  agricultural \n\n \nWithin the overall program framework of ASDP, the program loan will \nfacilitate  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  ensure  a  favorable \nenvironment  for  market-based  agricultural  growth.  The  loan  will  (i) \nprovide better access to productive land, water, improved seeds, and \nother  quality  agricultural  inputs;  (ii)  improve  efficiency  of  rubber \nproduction, and ensure no direct state intervention in the agricultural \nfacilitate  agricultural \ninput  and  output  markets;  and \ninstitutions  and \ncommercialization  by \nimproving access to effective research and extension services at the \nlocal level. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  17,485,000 \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, with a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe loan will finance the proposed policy and institutional reforms in \ntwo  tranches  over  3  years,  from  January  2004  to  December  2006. \nThe first tranche of $15 million equivalent will be available for release \nupon loan effectiveness, subject to full compliance with first-tranche \nconditions.  The  second  tranche  of  $10  million  equivalent  will  be \nreleased approximately 30 months later after due compliance by the \nGovernment with second-tranche conditions. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  and  the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  will  be  the  executing \nagencies for the program loan. MAFF will be responsible for overall \ninter-ministerial  program \nthrough  an \nprogram \nsecretariat.  The  Government  has  already  established  the  program \nsecretariat,  and  appointed  a  program  director,  who  will  head  the \nsecretariat,  and  one  full-time  counterpart  staff.  The  secretariat  will \nalso have a program support unit, headed by a program manager, to \nfacilitate \nthe \nprogram loan. \n \nThe  proceeds  generated  under  the  loan  will  be  used  to  support  the \nreform measures in the agriculture sector proposed under ASDP as \nthe  first  priority;  and,  secondly,  to  finance  other  expenditures  for \nagriculture and rural development. MEF will closely monitor the use \nof  such  funds.  Increased  adjustment  costs  will  be  required  to  (i) \nfacilitate  rural  development  support  at  the  local  level,  including \nagricultural \nimplement \nregulations  for  seeds,  agro-chemicals  and  marketing;  (iii)  complete \ndivestment  of  agricultural  public  enterprises;  and  (iv)  improve  the \ncapacity of agricultural institutions. \n \n \nThe  project  loan  will  provide  farmers  with  support  services  to \nincrease  agricultural  productivity  and  promote  diversification.  The \nproposed  project  activities  will  complement  the  program  loan, \nthereby enhancing the ASDP's overall program benefits.

The  project  will  involve  beneficiaries \nof social land concessions in the extension support component, and \nprovide  capacity-building  support  to  agencies  implementing  the \nreform measures proposed under the program loan. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $5.88  million  equivalent, \ncomprising $1.73 million (29%) in foreign exchange and $4.15 million \nequivalent (71%) in local currency costs. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nPercent \n\n \n  80 \n  20 \n \n100 \n\nSource \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n1.73 \n0.00 \n \n1.73 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n2.97 \n1.18 \n \n4.15 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n4.70 \n1.18 \n \n5.88 \n\nTotal \n\n \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  3,287,000 \nequivalent from the Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years \nmaturity,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n \nMAFF and MEF will be the executing agencies for the project loan. A \nproject  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  in  the  MAFF's \nprogram  secretariat.  PCU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  coordinator \nand include necessary support staff, and will be responsible for inter-\nagency  coordination  required  for  overall  project  implementation, \nprovision  of  guidance  for  the  provincial  and  district  staff,  and  other \ncentral-level  project  administration.  The  project  will  also  involve  (i) \nthe Seila Task Force for central-level coordination; (ii) provincial rural \ntheir  executive \ndevelopment  committees \ncommittee  secretariats;  and  provincial  departments  of  agriculture, \nforestry  and  fisheries  (PDAFFs);  (iii)  district  extension  staff  of \nPDAFFs;  and  (iv)  commune  councils.  Based  on  the  annual  work \nprogram  agreed  with  the  executive  committee  secretariats  of  the \nprovincial rural development committees, PDAFF will be responsible \nfor  ensuring  that  the  annual  work  program  for  the  concerned \nprovince  will  be  effectively  implemented  and  in  line  with  the \nGovernment's  decentralization  policy.  The  PCU  will  compile  all \nproject-related  documents  such  as  work  plans,  progress  reports, \nstatements  of  expenditures,  and \nloan  withdrawal  applications \nsubmitted by the project provinces. \n \nThe proceeds of the program loan will finance the foreign exchange \ncosts of eligible goods and services produced in, and procured from, \nADB  member  countries  (other  than  ineligible  items  specified  in  the \nLoan Agreement for the program loan, and imports financed by other \n\nthe  project  area; \n\nin \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nCost Estimate \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\nExecuting \nAgencies and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fvi \n\nLoan Agreement for the program loan, and imports financed by other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  funding  sources).  Eligible  items  will  be \nprocured  by  the  private  sector  on  the  basis  of  normal  commercial \npractices for procurement, or by the public sector in accordance with \nthe  Government's  prescribed  procurement  practices,  acceptable  to \nADB.  Under  the  project  loan,  service  vehicles,  equipment  and  civil \nworks  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  \n \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards  ASDP's  basic  assumption  is  the  continued  commitment  of  the \nGovernment  to  make  agriculture  more  productive  and  stable  by \nfacilitating  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification.  The \nGovernment's  strong  commitment  is  reflected  in  its  development \npolicy letter for ASDP. \n \nRisks are mainly related to difficulties anticipated in (i) approval and \nimplementation  of  subdecrees  related  to  social  and  economic  land \nconcessions,  and  (ii)  divestment  of  public  enterprises.  The \nimplementation of subdecrees related to social  and economic land \nconcessions involves difficult political processes and a large number \nof  stakeholders.  The  Government  must  establish  procedures  to \nscreen  potential  concession  programs  to  ensure  the  proper  use  of \navailable and unused state land for productive purposes and for the \nbenefit  of  poor  farmers.  Competition  for  such  land  should  be \nadequately  controlled.  ADB  is  helping  the  Government  establish \nimplementation guidelines for the social land concession subdecree \nand  formulate  a  draft  subdecree  on  economic  land  concessions \nthrough  an  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  land  legislation. \nADB  will  also  provide  TA  in  conjunction  with  ASDP  to  ensure  close \nmonitoring  of  ASDP  implementation  and  conduct  effective  dialogue \nwith  the  Government.  ADB  will  closely  coordinate  with  the  World \nBank,  which  will  initiate  the  social  land  concession  program  on  a \nsmall-scale pilot basis. \n \nThere  is  a  wide  consensus  within  the  Government  on  the  need  for \nearly divestment of agricultural public enterprises. ADB was informed \nthat  the  highest  authority  of  the  Government  decided  on  early \ndivestment,  and  initiated  the  process  for  carrying  out  external \nauditing  of  public  enterprises.  ADB  engaged  in  a  long  and  careful \ndialogue  with  the  enterprises  during  program  formulation  and  loan \nprocessing  to  ensure  that  the  Government  provides  adequate \nsafeguards  for  staff  to  be  separated  as  a  result  of  enterprise \ndivestment.  A  resettlement  policy  framework  has  been  agreed  on \nwith the Government to address any adverse social impacts that may \nresult  from  any  involuntary  acquisition  of  productive  opportunities \nand  displacement  of  smallholders  due  to  changes  in  land  use.  The \nTA,  proposed  in  conjunction  with  ASDP,  will  provide  technical  and \nadvisory  support  to  help  the  Government  complete  divestment  of \npublic enterprises during the program period. \n \n \n\n\fvii \n\nThe  risk  related  to  the  project  loan  that  farmers  may  not  adopt \nimproved  technology  and  inputs  is  minimal  as  farmers  showed \nstrong demand for them at various on-farm trials and on field days. In \nthe  southern  region  where  the  project  loan  will  be  implemented, \nfarmers'  demand  for  improved  seeds  and  extension  support  is  high \nfor beans and vegetables, reflecting the good marketing potentials of \nthese crops and local market conditions. \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  An  advisory  TA  is  being  proposed  in  conjunction  with  the  ASDP \nloans. The provision of grant funds of $1 million is being proposed to \nhelp the Government undertake policy and institutional reforms in the \nagriculture  sector.  The  proposed  TA  is  required  to  provide specific \ntechnical inputs, which are not easily available in Cambodia, and  will \nbe focused  on  the  areas  where  TA  contributions  to  market-oriented \nagriculture development will be maximized. The progress of policy and \ninstitutional reforms to be supported under the TA will be monitored in \nconjunction with ASDP.  The  proposed  TA  will  require  (i) consulting \nservices  consisting  of  29  person-months  of  international  and  28 \nperson-months of domestic consultants in agricultural policy planning \n(and  team  leadership),  corporate  management,  public  expenditure \nmanagement, agricultural research, social and gender analysis, and \nlaw;  (b)  office  equipment;  (c)  training  and  seminars;  (d)  local  travel; \nand  (e)  report  preparation  and  communications.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 3 years.  \n\n\f \n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP).  The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Policy and Institutional \nReforms in the Agriculture Sector, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nCambodia's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  was  estimated  at  $282  in  2001, \n2. \nmaking it one of the least developed countries in South and Southeast Asia. On account of its \nsocial  capacity  for  human  development,  Cambodia  is  in  the  lowest  tier  of  the  medium  human \ndevelopment category and ranked 130th, with its human development index in 2001 estimated \nat 0.556, and its gender development index at 0.551 (105th), one of the lowest in Asia.1 \n \nAbout  36%  of  the  country's  population  is  estimated  to  live  below  the  poverty  line,2 with \n3. \nabout 90% of the poor living in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty is about 40% or four \ntimes  that  for  Phnom  Penh.  Poverty  in  rural  Cambodia  is  pervasive  with  a  large  proportion  of \nrural population also living near the poverty line, presenting both an opportunity for a substantial \nreduction of poverty with the right policies and a danger of a rapid increase with inaction. The \ncharacteristics  of  poverty  differ  across  the  country:  (i)  limited  access  to  productive  resources \nand  low  productivity  in  the  south  and  southeast,  (ii)  displacement  and  resettlement  in  the \nnorthwest,  and  (iii)  poor  human  development  indicators  in  the  mountains  of  the  northeast. \nPoverty  is  particularly  prevalent  among  vulnerable  groups  affected  by  the  long  civil  conflict: \ninternally displaced people, returned refugees, and war widows. \n \n4. \nReducing poverty by emphasizing rural development was the primary development goal \nof  the  First  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPI,  1996\u20132000),  which  highlighted  food \nsecurity  and  transition  to  market-based  agriculture.  Key  components  of  SEDPI  included  (i) \nprovision  of  better  access  to  improved  agricultural  inputs;  (ii)  improvement  in  rice yields and \nreduction  in  production  loss  due  to  irregular  weather  conditions;  (iii)  promotion  of  livestock \nproduction,  particularly  by  improving  animal  health;  and  (iv)  promotion  of  commercialized \nagriculture.  Central  to  this  were  institutional,  regulatory,  and  policy  reforms  to  introduce  a \nframework conducive to market-based agricultural growth. \n \n5. \nCambodia is predominantly agrarian, with agriculture representing 39% of GDP, and at \nleast  70%  of  rural  population  directly  dependent  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood.  Of  the  total \ncropped area of about 2.6 million hectares (ha), 90% is planted with rice (2.3 million ha in 2000), \nwhich is the primary staple, providing about 70% of nutritional intake on average, with per capita \nconsumption  needs  estimated  at  151  kilograms  (kg)  of  white  rice.3  Agriculture  is  important  to \nreduce  rural  poverty  and  improve  the  capacity  for  human  development.

Forestry's contribution \nto  GDP  has  substantially  declined  in  recent  years  due  to  the  issue  of  illegal  logging  and \nsubsequent suspension of logging activities. A more detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \nUnder SEDPI, national GDP was targeted to grow on average at 7.5% per annum, with \n6. \nagriculture  expected  to  achieve  5.2%.  Domestic  political  conflicts  in  1997  and  the  regional \nfinancial  crises  of  1997  and  1998,  combined  with  the  severe  floods  of  2000,  reduced  overall \nGDP growth rate during the period to 6.7% per annum and agricultural growth to less than 3.0% \nper  annum  on  average  (with  high  variability),  well  below  the  SEDPI  targets.  Overall  poverty  in \nCambodia is  estimated  to  have  declined  during  the  SEDPI  period  but  this  was  largely  due  to \nsignificant reduction in urban poverty led by the growth of the garment sector. Slow agricultural \ngrowth  means  that  the  sector  provided  no  major  impetus  to  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  the \nlinkage between agriculture and the rest of the rural economy was thought to have weakened. \nMany  of  the  new  entrants  to  the  labor  force  have  thus  had  to  be  absorbed  into  relatively \nunproductive employment in agriculture. \n \nHowever, the  Government  introduced  important  institutional  and  policy  reforms  during \n7. \nthe SEDPI period with assistance of external funding agencies, including ADB\u2019s first Agriculture \nSector  Program  (ASP).4  ASP  initiated  several  reform  measures  to  establish  a  policy  and \ninstitutional framework for market-based agricultural growth, and resulted in (i) enactment of the \n2001 Land Law to improve security in land tenure and ownership; (ii) introduction of mass media \nprograms  to  provide  better  access  to  agricultural  technology  and  market  information;  (iii) \nreorganization  of  state-owned  public  enterprises  and  establishment  of  a  regulatory  framework \nfor  agricultural  inputs  in  the  market;  (iv)  launching  of  a  divestment  process  for  state-owned \nrubber  estates  (SOREs);  (v)  introduction  of  a  rural  road  maintenance  plan  and  budget;  (vi) \nestablishment  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  rural  finance  development;  and  (vii) \ndecentralization  of  development  activities.  ASP  was  generally  successful.  However,  the \nGovernment  recognizes  that  reforms  needed  deepening  to  fully  capture  the  benefits  of \nagricultural growth and poverty reduction. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\n8. \nThe  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII,  2001\u20132005)  was  officially \nlaunched  in  July  2002.5  Its  main  development  objectives  are  to  (i)  promote  broad-based \neconomic  growth  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  poor,  (ii)  facilitate  social  and  cultural \ndevelopment, and (iii) ensure the sustainable use of natural resources and sound environmental \nmanagement.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Government  aims  to  improve  the  country's \ngovernance  environment  and  attain  higher  economic  growth.  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  at  an \naverage rate of 6.1% per annum during the plan period. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1996.

Second  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132005. \n\nPhnom Penh. \n\n\f3 \n\nfor  a \n\nframework \n\n(iii)  accelerate  sustainable \n\nliberal  and  market-oriented \n\nland  management  and  administration; \n\nUnder SEDPII, the Government has shifted its focus from food security, which was the \n9. \ncore  strategy  of  SEDPI,  to  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification.  The  Government \nnow  aims  to  transform  agriculture  into  a  driving  force  to  achieve  higher  economic growth and \nreduce rural poverty. The Government's public investment program for 2001\u20132003 is expected \nto  allocate  $210.2  million  to  the  agriculture  sector  or  about  12%  of  the  total  program  amount. \nHowever,  at  present,  the  allocable  budget  ceiling  for  the  agriculture  sector  is  limited.  The \nstrategy of SEDPII for the agriculture sector is to (i) promote a consistent macroeconomic and \nagricultural  policy \ntrade  environment  by \nderegulating agricultural input and output markets; (ii) establish policy and legal frameworks for \neffective \nirrigation \ndevelopment;  (iv)  strengthen  essential  agricultural  support  services;  and  (v)  develop  quality \nstandards for  agricultural  inputs.  To  promote  agricultural  growth,  the  Government  wishes  to \ncontinue  and  enhance,  with  ADB's  assistance,  the  policy  and  institutional  reform  measures \nintroduced  under  the  first  ASP  (para.  7),  and  resolve  critical  issues  restricting  the  sector's \nperformance through focused investment. \n \nIn  line  with  SEDPII,  the  rolling  medium-term  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \n10. \n(NPRS)6 for 2003\u20132005 has been prepared by the Government with active participation of civil \nsociety organizations and assistance of external funding agencies. NPRS builds on SEDPII but \nseeks to clearly define and implement the Government\u2019s approach to poverty reduction. NPRS's \ncentral objective is to mainstream efforts to reduce poverty, shifting from a series of projects to \nintegrated budgetary support. NPRS aims to reduce rural poverty by addressing (i) inadequate \naccess  to  land;  (ii)  weak  management  of  water  resources;  and  (iii)  lack  of  rural  infrastructure. \nAccess to land and water is highlighted as the fundamental natural resources forming the basis \nfor economic growth and poverty reduction, especially in rural areas where people rely on them \nfor  agriculture.  Besides  land  and  water,  key  elements  of  the  agricultural  strategy  also  include \nimproved access to effective research and extension services, quality inputs, and markets. \n \nSEDPII and NPRS stress the need to improve productivity and value added of rural land \n11. \nand  labor.  While  food  security  is  being  addressed,  the  dominance  of  subsistence  or  near-\nsubsistence  production  of  low-value  rice  undermines  efforts  to  raise  incomes  and  generate \nemployment  in  rural  communities.  The  lack  of  linkages  with  agro-industries  is  also  seen  as \nlimiting  the  value-added  potential  of  agriculture  and  its  multiplier  effects  through industry and \nservices.  Emphasis  is,  therefore,  put  on  commercializing  agriculture,  and  creating  links  with \nprocessing and support services. However, a number of impediments still hinder this approach. \nASDP  is  designed  to  help  overcome  such  impediments  or  reduce  their  significance  through \nsupport  for  market-oriented  initiatives  in  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  through  direct \ninvestment to improve public sector services. \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to Resources and Inputs \n\n12. \nThe  revised  Land  Law  was  enacted  in  August  2001  to  ensure  consistency  with  the \nConstitution,  and  clear  legal  definitions  and  terminology  about  land  ownership.  However, \nestablishment and granting of agricultural land titles remain problematic, and many disputes are \nstill  being  reported.  Land  concessions  are  also  the  subject  of  much  debate  because  of  their \nrelevance  to  strategies  for  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  the  issue  is  highly \npolitical.  By  November  2002  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  had \ngranted  25  land  concessions  for  agricultural  production,  covering  about  724,000  ha  under \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  December  2002.  National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005. Phnom \n\nPenh. \n\n\f4 \n\ncontracts with concessionaires (mainly from 1998 to 2001). MAFF further reported that only 10 \nconcessions initiated planting, involving about 14,000 ha or less than 2% of the total concession \nareas. The remaining concession areas are unused due to absence of infrastructure for access \nand land disputes. \n \n13. \nUnder  the  2001  Land  Law,  land  concessions  should  not  exceed  10,000  ha  unless \njustified by evidence of actual investment and needs. This limit is to be applied to existing and \nnew  concessions,  necessitating  renegotiation  of  concession  contracts  and  revocation  of \nconcessions over this limit. Strict application of the limit is expected to release at least 412,000 \nha  of  land  designated  for  agriculture,  which  would  provide  ample  resources  to  promote \nproductive economic concessions and to allocate land to the landless. There will be a potential \nfor increasing various income-generating activities for the poor, and examples of the integration \nof  smallholder  and  estate  agriculture  can  be  found  across  Southeast  Asia.  The  Government \nthus  recognizes  the  need  to  (i)  reduce  unused  economic  land  concessions,  (ii)  further \naccelerate the securing of land titles for farmers, and (iii) implement the 2001 Land Law through \nthe issuance of necessary subdecrees and guidelines. \n \n14.  Most  crop  production  in  Cambodia  is  rain-fed.  Irrigation  is  often  supplementary  and \nseason-specific  rather  than  year-round.  Even  this  supplementary  irrigation  is  limited,  covering \nonly  16%  of  the  total  rice  growing  area.  In  addition,  a  flood  recession  system  of  production  is \nused on 7% of the area. As a result, almost all rice is single-cropped and highly dependent on \nrainfall. Under the first ASP, new approaches to irrigation management and maintenance were \ntested  based  on  the  formation  of  farmers'  water  user  communities  (FWUCs).  Eleven  pilot \nschemes  are  being  pursued  under  the  MAFF's  medium-term  work  program  for  2001\u20132005. A \nwater  law  is  being  reviewed  at  the  National  Assembly,  and  a  new  statement  on  water  policy \ndrafted,  incorporating  the  commitment  and  mechanisms  for  sustainable  small-  and  medium-\nscale  irrigation  schemes.  In  parallel,  the  Government  is  increasing  investment  in  irrigation \nprojects with assistance from bilateral and multilateral funding agencies, including ADB. \n \n15. \nFarmers'  access  to  improved  seeds  and  other  inputs  is  still  limited  due  to  their  lack  of \nawareness  of  the  benefits  of  using  improved  seeds  and  other  required  inputs.  Im portant \ncontributions are being made to the production and dissemination of improved rice seeds by the \nCambodian  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  Institute  (CARDI)  with  support  from  the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  and  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Agricultural \nProductivity Improvement Project. However, total production of improved rice seeds is still small \n(about 400 tons), barely enough to cover the needs of most farmers. To improve the legal and \ninstitutional framework for seed production and distribution, the Government is drafting a seed \nlaw,  which  aims  to  promote  the  private  sector's  role  in  improving  seed  production  and \ndistribution. This is an important step to initiate the promotion of the seed and planting materials \nindustry  in  Cambodia.  Other  important  areas  also  need  to  be  addressed:  quality  control \nmeasures, regulatory enforcement mechanisms and capacity building. The projects financed by \nother funding agencies are involved in these areas. The Government also issued a subdecree \nand established the Bureau of Agricultural Materials Standards within MAFF in October 1998 to \nprovide a regulatory framework to protect farmers and other users of agricultural inputs (seeds, \nfertilizers,  pesticides,  veterinary  medicines,  feeds  and  feed  additives)  from  adulteration, \ncommercial  exploitation  and  dangers  to  health  as  a  result  of  low-quality  products  and \ninappropriate packaging. Much remains to be done, particularly to address issues such as the \npresence  of  unmarked  and  concentrated  chemicals,  and  over-adulteration  of  products,  by \nstrengthening the bureau's capacity and raising awareness of these issues among farmers. \n \n\n\f5 \n\nFarmers  often  report  that  limited  access  to  finance  is  a  major  impediment  to  adopting \n16. \nimproved technology to raise productivity, diversify into higher-value commodities, and establish \nprocessing and service enterprises. Rural outreach by formal financial institutions is extremely \nlimited and there appears to be a serious level of mistrust in formal financial institutions among \nrural population. Numerous non-government programs provide small-scale credit although their \noverall impact is small. Licensed microfinance institutions also have sizeable loan portfolios and \nbroad  area  coverage.7  Still,  deficiencies  of  rural  finance,  involving  savings  mobilization  and \ncredit  provision,  are  major \nIn \ncollaboration with other multilateral financial institutions, ADB is addressing the issue of the rural \nfinancial system under the financial sector program.8 \n \n\nto  developing  commercialized  agriculture. \n\nimpediments \n\n3. \n\nMarket Environment for Private Agro-Based Enterprises \n\n17. \nDuring  the  first  ASP  period,  the  Government  initiated  steps  for  withdrawing  its  direct \nintervention  in  production  and  marketing  of  agricultural  and  agro-based  products.  In  the \nagriculture  sector,  the  Government  owns  seven  rubber  estates,  Agricultural  Inputs  Company \n(AIC),  and  Kampuchea  Fish  Import  and  Export  Company  (KAMFIMEX).  While  SOREs  remain \nactive  producers  constituting  about  80%  of  the  total  rubber  exploited  area  of  the  country,  the \nother  two  enterprises'  activities  have  been  significantly  curtailed  as  private  companies  have \nincreased  their  market  shares.  SOREs  have  been  posting  losses  for  a  number  of  years  and \nappear  to  drain  resources  from  the  rubber  sector.  Continued  state  ownership  impedes  the \ngrowth  of  the  whole  rubber  sector  by  restricting  development  of  smallholder  or  family  rubber \nproducers  and  by  constraining  smallholder  processing  and  marketing  of  rubber.  The  impaired \nquality of estate rubber also constrains the promotion of Cambodian rubber in the international \nmarket.  It  is  reported  that  this  results  in  the  lower  price  of  Cambodian  rubber  by  15\u201320% as \ncompared  to  that  of  other  countries'  rubber,  which  is  certified  for  international  standards,  and \nseriously  affects  smallholders'  income.  Thus,  SOREs'  operationally  and  financially  poor \nperformance hinders efficient use of resources and points to a lost opportunity for development. \n \n18. \nState ownership of AIC and KAMFIMEX also uses scarce public resources for redundant \noperations, and provides uncertainty in the agricultural input and output markets about possible \nstate  interventions  in  future.  Bureaucratic  procedures  and  informal  government  pressures  for \nsocial  and  political  imperatives  restrict  the  day-to-day management of public enterprises. AIC, \nwhich is supposed to distribute agricultural inputs, has not had any business recently and has \nbeen  paying  administrative  expenses,  including  salaries  of  its  55  staff,  from  the  receipt  of \ninterest on cash assets. Given that the private sector sufficiently meets input supply, there is no \nclear  justification  for  the  state  ownership  of  AIC,  and  the  Government  recognizes  the  need  to \nfacilitate AIC's divestment. KAMFIMEX had a monopoly of fish exports until 2000, when export \nof  live  fish  and  fish  products  was  liberalized.  KAMFIMEX  still  acts  as  an  agent  for  small  fish \ntraders, allowing export under its license, with a fee to cover customs duties and other charges. \nKAMFIMEX  currently  has  103  full-time  staff  and  40  fishermen  associated  with  its  fishing  lot. \nThough it became an autonomous public enterprise in September 2002, KAMFIMEX's financial \nperformance has not been made public yet. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB  provides  lines  of  credit  to  some  of  the  licensed  financial  institutions  under  ADB.  2000.

MAFF was the lead executing agency for the first ASP and implemented it satisfactorily. \nMAFF  operates  a  standardized  planning  process  using  procedures  that  are  reasonably  well \nestablished.  MAFF's  current  organizational  structure  was  adopted  in  April  2000  through  a \nsubdecree  establishing  12  line  departments.9  Planning  capacities  are  variable  among  MAFF \ndepartments  partly  because  of  variable  training  and  capacity-building  programs  in  the  past. \nCore  functions  among  the  departments  are  unclear,  particularly  in  the  role  of  policy  planning \nand management, and  due  to  the  mixture  and  overlapping  of  service  delivery  functions.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  a  strong  need  to  review  the  structure  to  clarify  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  these  departments  within  MAFF  in  a  market-oriented agriculture sector. The \nreorganization  of  MAFF  needs  to  be  carried  out  based  on  such  a  review  and  the  renewed \nstrategy for human resource development in line with the Government's decentralization policy. \n \n20. \nThe Government has been pursuing accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nThe action plan to comply with membership conditions in various areas has been implemented \nsatisfactorily.  In  July  2003,  WTO  completed  its  work  for  Cambodia's  membership  and \nrecommended it in September 2003. The Government has established a task force to address \nWTO  issues  in  the  agriculture  sector.  Several  important  aspects  regarding  harmonization  of \nregulations  and  procedures  relate  to  plant  protection  and  animal  health.  The  Government  has \nalso  established  a  WTO  unit  in  MAFF  to  implement  regulations  and  prepare  new  regulatory \nsystems to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural and agro-based products in accordance \nwith WTO provisions. \n \n\n5. \n\nGender in the Agriculture Sector \n\ntechnology,  and  productive  resources, \n\n21.  Women  constitute  more  than  half  the  farming  population,  and  are  engaged  in  various \nagricultural activities, including seed selection, transplanting and harvesting in rice farming, and \ncaring  for  household  members.  Women  also  do  milling  and  pounding  of  paddy  for  household \nconsumption. The gender division of labor  is not entirely rigid but men expect to be paid more \nfor remunerative activities. Women farmers are also active in homestead vegetable production \nand  small  livestock  for  subsistence  and  cash  income.  However,  their  access  to  improved \nis \nknowledge  and \nsubstantially limited due to their unrecognized social role, inadequate literacy and socio-cultural \ninhibition  in  the  villages.  Women  are  under-represented  in  agricultural  institutions.  Female \nextension  workers  are  less  than  one  third  of  the  total  extension  staff  at  the  local  level.  The \nsituation  is  even  worse  at  MAFF's  central  offices.  Female  students  are  under-represented in \nagricultural  universities  and  colleges.  To  increase  the  effectiveness  of  agricultural  support \nservices,  women  farmers'  access  to  such  services  must  be  increased  through  sector-wide \nimprovement  in  mainstreaming  of  gender  issues.  The  Government  has  long  recognized  this \nneed  in  the  agriculture  sector  but  progress  has  been  rather  slow.  During  SEDPII,  the \nGovernment  aims  at  establishing  a  sector-wide \nfor  gender \nmainstreaming. \n \n\nfinancial  services, \n\ninstitutional \n\nframework \n\nincluding \n\n6. \n\nAgricultural Support Services \n\n22. \nFollowing  liberalization  of  markets  from  1989  to  1996,  the  Government  clearly  lacked \ninformation  about  market  conditions  and  opportunities  at  home  and  abroad.  Agricultural \nactivities and development strategies of the Government continued to be production rather than \n\n                                                 \n9   An assessment of agricultural institutions in Cambodia is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n\f7 \n\nmarket  oriented.  Small  markets,  however,  exhibited  strong  competitive  characteristics with a \nlarge number of small retailers, middlemen and wholesalers. Product prices were largely set by \ntraders on the basis of privileged information about domestic and regional markets. Under the \nfirst  ASP,  the  Agricultural  Marketing  Office  was  established,  and  staff  trained.  A  survey  to \nassess  the  impact  of  the  market  information  services  (MIS)  was  undertaken  in  1998.  The \nassessment  indicated  that  it  benefited  about  80%  of  farmers  and  traders,  and  strengthened \nfarmers'  bargaining  power.  Some  also  questioned  the  usefulness  of  the  information  collected \nand  the  way  it  was  presented  for  dissemination.  In  general,  it  was  considered  too  early  to \nconclude the outcome of the assessment as the MIS was still being developed. During SEDPII, \nfurther  strengthening  of  the  agricultural  MIS  of  MAFF  is  being  planned  by  the  Government  to \ncontinue and broaden MIS data collection and dissemination, and provide training in marketing \nand market analysis, survey methodologies and data management systems.  \n \n23. \nUnder  SEDPII,  the  Government  intends  to  raise  value  added  in  agriculture  by \ndiversifying  into  higher-value  products,  and  increasing  downstream  processing  and  related \nservices. Undermining this approach are low yields and uncertain quality of products. With the \ncountry's scarce resources to improve access to agricultural technology, research efforts must \nbe client oriented and highly focused on resolving issues that have the most immediate impact \non the users of research. A national policy for agricultural research and extension was approved \nby the Government in October 1998 to improve the delivery and use of research and extension \nservices, dwelling extensively on institutional issues to make them more effective at addressing \nthe  critical  issues.  Crucially,  research  institutions  were  to  be  divorced  from  direct  MAFF \nmanagement  to  support  intellectual  independence  and  budgetary  autonomy  to  allow  for \ncommitment to medium- and long-term research programs. The national policy also emphasizes \nthe  need  to  strengthen  coordination  among  research  institutes,  universities,  government \nagencies and the private sector. \n \n24. \nThe  agricultural  extension  services  receive  only  about  2%  of  MAFF's  total  recurrent \nbudget despite their importance in improving farm productivity. Inadequate allocation of budget \nfor  district  and  provincial  extension  services  hampers  delivery  of  support  services  for  farmers \nand  affects  service  quality.  MAFF's  extension  services  have  been  long  supported  by  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  since  1995.  Technology  extension  has  also  been  supported  through \nvarious  area  development  projects  financed  by  other  external  funding  agencies.  However,  as \nthe Australian support will be gradually reduced, MAFF urgently requires an increased budget to \nmaintain even the current level of support services. Additional resources are also needed at the \ndistrict and provincial levels to complement efforts of area development projects and expand the \ncoverage  of  extension  services  to  areas  with  greater  potential  for  commercialized  and \ndiversified agriculture. The Government is also trying to raise motivation of extension staff and \nmake  them  more  accountable  by  removing  the  system  of  patronage  that  normally  determines \ncareer development and undermines incentives. \n \n\n7. \n\nCurrent Policy Environment \n\n25. \nA major thrust of government policy has been towards the decentralization of decision-\nmaking  and  the  deconcentration  of  public  service  delivery,  and  these  have  become  key \nelements  in  the  drive  to  strengthen  governance,  promote  administrative  reforms  and  reduce \npoverty. Before the commune council elections in February 2002, the average Cambodian had \nlittle  contact  or  knowledge  of  commune-level  administration.  The  election  introduced  a \nrepresentative  level  of  local  government;  11,261  councilors  were  elected  to  1,621  commune \ncouncils, with 5- 11  members  in  each  council.  Commune  councils  are  still  in  their  infancy  and \n\n\f8 \n\ngenerally  have  only  one  clerk.10  Efforts  for  deconcentration  of  service  delivery  have  been \ndirected at strengthening capacity of line ministries at the provincial level, including for service \ndelivery  through  district  offices.  A  number  of  ministries  have  begun  to  assess  the  potential \nservice delivery role for commune councils. Accordingly, the current policy of the Government is \nto  fully  take  into  account  the  deconcentration  of  public  service  delivery  in  implementation \narrangements proposed for new public sector projects in the agriculture sector. \n \n26. \nIn 2000 the Government announced its decision to introduce a medium-term expenditure \nframework  (MTEF)  to  budget  planning  in  priority  sectors,  including  the  agriculture  sector.11 \nMTEF  aims  to  provide  a  medium-term  rolling  process  and  mechanism  for  continuity  to  link \ndevelopment  plans,  multi-year  programs,  and  annual  recurrent  budgets.  This  approach  is \nexpected  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures  in  pursuit  of  development \nobjectives. The MTEF approach will be introduced into the agriculture sector for the 2004- 2006 \nframework  during  ASDP.  To  make  the  approach  effective,  MAFF's  central  role  in  policy  and \nplanning needs to be strengthened in parallel by rationalizing MAFF departments (para. 19). \n \n\n8. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n27. \nTotal external assistance to the agriculture sector in Cambodia amounted to about $35.4 \nmillion  in  2001  on  an  annual  disbursement  basis,  including  multilateral  (54%)  and  bilateral \n(43%) agencies, and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) (3%). Since 1992 ADB \nhas  provided  24  loans,  amounting  to  a  cumulative  total  of  about  $620  million  on  a commitment \nbasis,  and  101  TAs  totaling  about  $68  million.  Eight  loans,  including  portions  of  emergency \nassistance  loans,12  for  a  total  of  $158.7  million  or  about  26%  of  the  ADB's  total  committed  loan \nproceeds, are for agriculture and rural development. In the agriculture sector, the largest bilateral \nfunding  source  is  Japan,  followed  by  France,  Australia,  and  Denmark.  Other  major  external \nfunding  agencies  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  Cambodia  include,  among  others,  European \nCommunity,  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations,  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural  Development,  and  World  Bank.  ADB  has  been  active  in  ensuring  adequate \ncoordination  with  other  external  funding  agencies  through  working  group  meetings  of  the \nconsultative  group  of  external  funding  agencies  in  agriculture  and  natural  resources.  External \nfunding agencies involved in agriculture and rural development will be regularly briefed on the \nprogress  of  ASDP  implementation  at  these  working  group  meetings.  The  development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n9. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n28. \nADB prepared project performance audit reports for the Special Rehabilitation Assistance \nLoan13  and  for  the  first  ASP  (footnote  4).

ADB emphasized the \nimportance of stakeholder consultations in formulating and agreeing on the framework of ASDP. \n \nExperiences  from  the  past  and  ongoing  projects  of  ADB  and  other  external  funding \n29. \nagencies  often  indicate  common  practical  issues  related  to  insufficient  project  readiness  when \napproved  and  shortage  of  skilled  and  experienced  people  to  implement  foreign-aided projects. \nThese  issues  need  to  be  continuously  addressed  during  country  portfolio review exercises and \nregularly  discussed  with  the  Government  by  project  review  missions.  ASDP  will  be  supervised \nintensively to ensure that it is implemented effectively and its program impact sustainable. \n \n\n10. \n\nADB's Operational Strategy for the Agriculture Sector \n\n30. \nADB's  current  operational  strategy  in  Cambodia  focuses  on  the  three  priority  areas:  (i) \nrural  economic  development,  (ii)  human  resource  and  social  development,  and  (iii)  private \nsector development.14 A new country strategy and program is expected in early 2004. It can be \nstrengthened  by  sharpening  its  focus  on  implications  of  the  state  reform  program  and  by \nenhancing  the  impact  of  sector  interventions  on  poverty  reduction.  The  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment  will  continue  to  make  ADB  operations  more  effective.  ADB  agrees  with  the \nGovernment  that  critical  constraints  on  agricultural  growth  and  productivity  need  to  be \naddressed  under  ASDP  in  line  with  SEDPII  and  NPRS  of  the  Government.  Farmers'  better \naccess  to  productive  resources,  a  favorable  market  environment,  and  improved  inputs  are \ncritical to increased productivity, production and farm income. ASDP has been formulated in this \nconceptual framework. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n1. \n\nObjective \n\n31. \nASDP  aims  to  promote  sustainable  growth  of  the  market-based  agriculture  sector  in \nCambodia,  and  thereby  contributing  to  overall  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. ASDP \nwill  facilitate  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification  in  line  with  SEDPII  and  also \nensure  that  the  poor  and  women  increasingly  participate  in  agricultural  production,  marketing, \nand post-production system. The program framework is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n2. \n\nScope \n\n32. \nASDP's  overall  scope  will  include  support  to  (i)  improve  farmers'  ability  to  raise \nproductivity  and  diversify  into  higher-value  products,  (ii)  improve  the  market  environment  for \nprivate  agro-based  enterprise  growth,  and  (iii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  competitive \nagricultural commercialization. A development policy letter, describing the Government's reform \nmeasures under ASDP, with a policy matrix, summarizing the sequence and specific actions, is \nin Appendix 4. \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Cambodia. Manila. \n\n\f10 \n\n \nB. \n\nImportant Features \n\n33. \nThe need to integrate farmers into rapidly growing urban markets and international trade \nis  at  the  core  of  ASDP's  approach  to  sustainable  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction. \nASDP includes a range of measures to provide support for this broad framework. The general \nprinciples  adopted  in  formulating  ASDP  were  (i)  consistency  with  SEDPII  and  NPRS,  (ii) \ncoordination  with  other  programs  and  projects  in  the  agriculture  sector  to  avoid  duplication  of \nefforts, and (iii) close linkage between the program component and the project component. The \nTA  proposed  in  conjunction  with  ASDP  will  provide  the  Government  with  the  technical  and \nadvisory support required to achieve ASDP's objectives. \n \nC. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n34.  Within  the  overall  framework  of  ASDP,  the  program  loan  aims  to  facilitate  policy  and \ninstitutional  reform  measures  to  ensure  a  favorable  environment  for  market-based agricultural \ngrowth.  The  loan  will  (i)  provide  better  access  to  productive  land,  water,  improved  seeds,  and \nother agricultural inputs of good quality; (ii) improve efficiency of rubber production, and ensure \nno  direct  state  interventions  in  the  agricultural  input  and  output  markets;  and  (iii)  facilitate \nagricultural  commercialization  by  strengthening  and  rationalizing  agricultural  institutions,  and \nproviding access to improved support services. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\na. \n\nAccess to Productive Resources and Inputs \n\nThe  2001  Land  Law  gives  the  poor  and  the  landless  improved  access to unused state \n35. \nland. For this purpose, a subdecree for social land concessions15 was approved by the Council \nof  Ministers  on  19  March  2003.  This  also  fulfilled  the  Government's  commitment  made  to  the \nconsultative group of external funding agencies. Adequate consultations with key stakeholders \nhave  been  conducted  for  the  finalization  of  the  draft  subdecree  with  assistance  from  ADB's \nongoing  TA. 16  Under  the  subdecree,  the  Government  will  distribute  unused  land  to  eligible \nhouseholds  for  productive  purposes.  Initially,  a  small-scale  pilot  project  for  social  land \nconcessions will be implemented under the World Bank's Land Management and Administration \nProject.  Within  a  year  the  Government  is  expected  to  complete  the  implementation  guidelines \nfor  the  subdecree  to  establish  screening  procedures  for  potential  social  land  concession \nprograms  and  provide  adequate  control  over  competitions for state land. The Government will \nalso  establish  and  implement,  before  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the  program  loan,  a \nmechanism to provide extension support for beneficiaries of social land concessions.  \n \n36. \nThe  Government  has  given  out  agricultural  concessions  to  private  companies  and \nindividuals  for  commercial  farming.  The  underlying  rationale  was  that  large  estates,  with  their \nlarge-scale  investments,  would  be  able  to  use  land  more  efficiently  and  productively  than \nsmallholders.  However,  most  agricultural  concession  lands  remain  unused  without  generating \n                                                 \n15 Social land concession is a legal mechanism to transfer private state land for social purposes to the poor who lack \n\nland for residential or subsistence farm ing purposes. \n\n16 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Implementation of Land Legislation. Manila.  (TA \n3577- CAM).  A  follow-up  support  will  be  provided  under  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for Implementation of Land Legislation-Phase 2. Manila.  (TA 4181- CAM). \n\n\f11 \n\nexpected  benefits  (para.  12).  The  Government  is  rationalizing  these  concession  lands  and, \naccording  to  the  official  record,  revoked  about  100,000  ha  of  unused  concessions  by  August \n2002.  To  facilitate  this  process,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  draft  subdecree  on  reducing \nunused  economic  concessions  in  consultation  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.17 The Land \nPolicy  Council  of  the  Government  thus  established  an  interministerial  working  group  in  May \n2003, involving MAFF and the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. \nThe  Government  will  approve  this  subdecree  in  line  with  the  Land  Law  before  release  of  the \nsecond tranche of the loan. \n \n37. \nThe Government has drafted a national water policy (para. 14) and will issue this policy \nbefore  the  release  of  the  first  tranche  of  the  loan  to  provide  broad  guidelines  for  efficient  and \neffective  water  resource  management.  In  parallel,  the  Government  has  been  undertaking pilot \nprojects to introduce FWUCs and  cost-sharing arrangements for public irrigation schemes to \nimprove the use and management of irrigation water. The policy also aims to increase funding \nfor  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  schemes  in  the  long  run.  Three  pilot \nschemes are being implemented with NGO assistance. To further promote sustainable irrigation \nmanagement,  the  Government  will  expand  this  pilot  activity  during  2001\u20132005  to  8  other \nirrigation schemes in the country,18 and complete forming FWUCs under all 11 schemes before \nthe second tranche release. \n \nDuring  the  1990s  Cambodia's  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  free  market \n38. \neconomy  affected  the  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,  including  improved  seeds  (para.  15).  The \nGovernment recognizes that a modern private seed sector needs to be developed to increase \nproduction and delivery of quality seeds to farmers. The Government will finalize the draft seed \nlaw  through  consultations  with  key  stakeholders,  and  submit  it  to  the  National  Assembly  for \napproval before the release of the second tranche of the program loan. In accordance with the \nenvisioned  law,  public  research  institutes  such  as  CARDI  will  focus  on  basic  research,  variety \ndevelopment, and foundation seed production, with the private sector engaged in multiplication \nand distribution under a new regulatory framework.  \n \n39. \nThe Government introduced a legal framework to ensure the quality and environmental \nstandards  of  agricultural  inputs.  The  Bureau  of  Agricultural  Materials  Standards,  which  was \nestablished for this purpose, has 7 staff and 47 provincial inspectors, who received training on \nthe  inspection  and  management  of  agricultural  inputs.  In  October  2002  the  Government \napproved  the  guidelines  for  local-level  implementation  of  the  subdecree.  Awareness  of \nagrochemical quality and requirements for handling agrochemicals will be widely disseminated \nto farmers through the extension system. During ASDP, the bureau will distribute the guidelines \nin Khmer language and complete training and seminars for provincial staff and private traders, \nand,  before  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the  loan,  establish  an  appropriate  inspection \nsystem in collaboration with other government agencies. \n \n\nb. \n\nEnvironment for Private Agro-Based Enterprise Growth \n\n40. \nUnder  the  first  ASP,  the  Government  initiated  the  divestment  of  seven  SOREs,  which \nwere  in  poor  condition  due  to  weak  management,  unskilled  tapping,  inadequate  maintenance, \nold  trees  and  theft.  In  March  1999  these  estates  were  converted  into  self-financing  public \nenterprises, which are still owned by the Government and being operated under restrictions of \nbureaucratic  procedures  and  weak  marketing  mechanisms  (para.  17).  To reverse the current \n\n                                                 \n17  Economic concessions allow beneficiaries to clear areas of state land for agriculture and agro-industry purposes. \n18 These schemes are located in 11 provinces, including the 4 ASDP project provinces. \n\n\f12 \n\nsituation of the rubber sector, the Government has accelerated the divestment process for the \nseven SOREs, and in May 2003 established a national committee for the divestment of state-\nowned public enterprises in the agriculture sector. A private, well-qualified external auditor will \nbe  appointed  to  conduct  an  audit  following  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  before \nthe  first  tranche  of  the  program  loan  is  released.  The  Government  will  update  and  revise  the \n1998 Divestment Plan for SOREs19 based on the audit results, and complete the divestment of \nthe SOREs before release of the second tranche of the loan according to the plan and schedule \nagreed  with  ADB,  which  should  include  appropriate  safety  net  measures  for  any  possible \nadverse social impact. The Government has also initiated an overall review of the rubber sector \nand  examined  the  rules  and  regulations  for  marketing  rubber  products.  Before  release  of  the \nloan's second tranche, the Government will have removed the identified regulatory constraints \non marketing unprocessed and processed rubber. \n \n41. \nOver  the  past  2  years,  AIC  has  been  transformed  into  a  state-owned public enterprise \nwith  its  own  statute,  and  registered  as  a  company  with  Ministry  of  Commerce.  However,  AIC \nhas been unable to fulfill its mandate as an autonomous enterprise without government support, \nand  still  uses  scarce  fiscal  resources  for  unproductive  purposes.  Under  the  new  market \nenvironment  of  increased  competition  from  the  private  sector,  the  Government  recognizes  the \nneed  to  complete  divestment  of  AIC.  KAMFIMEX  was  restructured  into  an  autonomous  public \nenterprise  in  September  2002,  and  its  role  in  the  market  greatly  reduced.  However,  state \nownership of KAMFIMEX still gives a high level of market uncertainty as direct state intervention \nmay still be possible in future. In particular, KAMFIMEX's influence over fish exports and linkage \nwith MAFF's Department of Fisheries constrain further liberalization of fish production and trade. \nIn  this  context,  the  Government  will,  through  the  national  divestment  committee  (para.  40), \nestablish  a  timetable  for  divestment,  and  appoint  a  private,  well-qualified  external  auditor, \nacceptable to ADB, to carry out auditing according to internationally accepted standards before \nthe  first  tranche  release.  The  Government  will  complete  divestment  of  AIC  and  KAMFIMEX \nbefore release of the second tranche. \n \n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening for Agricultural Commercialization \n\n42. \nThe  roles  and  responsibilities  of  some  departments  of  MAFF  still  continue  to  overlap, \nand  the  policy  planning  and  monitoring  functions  are  scattered  among  them.  A  higher-level \nplanning  unit  of  MAFF  is  urgently  needed,  The  Government  will  conduct  a  review  of  the \nmandates  of  MAFF's  departments  during  ASP,  then  rationalize  them,  and  approve  a  new \nsubdecree before release of the second tranche of the loan. This reorganization will particularly \nstrengthen  the  role  of  the  Department  of  Planning,  Statistics,  and  International  Cooperation  in \nagricultural policy planning, program budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n43.  MAFF  has  been  making  efforts  to  promote  mainstreaming  of  gender  issues  in  the \nagriculture  sector  mainly  on  a  project-by-project  basis  with  limited  coordination  among  them. \nImpact of these activities on sector-wide progress of gender mainstreaming has, therefore, been \nrather  minimal.  In  June  2003,  MAFF,  in  collaboration  with  Ministry  of  Women's  and  Veterans' \nAffairs,  established  a  working  group  to  formulate  a  sector-wide  policy  and  strategy  to \nmainstream  gender  issues.  This  initiative  will  enhance  women's  role  in  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment, and improve women's access to agricultural support services. Before the second \n\n                                                 \n19 The  1998  divestment  plan  and  related  social  impact  assessment  report  were  prepared  under  ADB's  technical \nassistance provided in conjunction with the first ASP (footnote 4). ADB. 1996.  Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nthe Agriculture Sector Program . Manila. (TA 2591- CAM: Agricultural Policy Reform Support). \n\n\f13 \n\ntranche release, the Government will approve and commence implementation of this policy and \nstrategy,  which  will  also  include  specific  action  plans.  The  TA  proposed  in  conjunction  with \nASDP will help facilitate this process (para. 79). \n \nTo  support  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification,  effective  institutions  are \n44. \nrequired to facilitate the integration of farmers and private enterprises into rapidly growing urban \nand  international  markets,  and  to  ensure  that  products  meet  strict  food  safety  and  quality \nstandards to gain access to such markets. Cambodia is expected to become a member of WTO \nsoon and will need a skilled public sector to help the country exploit the opportunities that WTO \nmembership  will  bring.  To  ensure  conformity  with  WTO's  regulatory  requirements  in  the \nagriculture  sector,  the  Government  has  already  formulated  a  detailed  timetable,  and  has \nestablished in June 2003 a unit in MAFF specifically tasked to facilitate WTO-related activities. \nIn  particular,  MAFF  will  ensure  harmonization  with  WTO's  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary \nrequirements  during  ASDP,  including,  inter  alia,  revision  of  existing  regulations,  provision  of \ntraining programs, and upgrading of laboratory facilities, which the TA will address. \n \nDuring  the  first  ASP,  the  Government  commenced  a  program  of  agricultural  MIS  to \n45. \ndisseminate  information  on  markets  for  major  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  (para.  22).  The \nprogram  contents  were  subsequently  revised  with  assistance  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, and the information is now being broadcast by the National \nRadio of Cambodia, Bayon Radio and TV, and Radio Battambang. Price information is collected \nby MAFF's provincial agricultural marketing offices from wholesale traders in Phnom Penh and \nnine  provincial  market  centers.  An  impact  assessment  on  MIS  indicated  that  it  generally \nbenefited farmers and traders. However, the Government recognizes the need to reassess the \ncurrent system, and will formulate and implement a more effective strategy for MIS, satisfactory \nto ADB, before release of the second tranche of the loan. \n \n46. \nThe  Government  of  Australia  has  been  helping  Cambodia  strengthen  agricultural \nresearch and extension, particularly in rice farming, in collaboration with the International Rice \nResearch  Institute,  and  significantly  contributed  to  achieving  the  country's  rice self-sufficiency. \nHowever, the provision of public support services in agricultural research and extension is still \nheavily  constrained  by  the  shortage  of  financial  and  human  resources.  For  non-rice  crops, \nnational  capacity  is  even  weaker,  although  there  have  been  efforts  by  MAFF  to  improve \ntechnology  and  service  delivery  in  vegetable  production,20  and  the  World  Bank's  Agriculture \nProductivity  Improvement  Project  is  supporting  rubber  research.  Private  sector  capacity  in \nresearch and extension is also limited. \n \n47. \nTo  provide  better  access  to  improved  knowledge  and  technology  for  competitive \nagricultural  commercialization,  the  Government  intends  to  improve  the  national  system  for \nagricultural research and make it more responsive to client needs in line with the 1998 national \npolicy  (para.  23).  MAFF  is  now  in  the  process  of  strengthening  CARDI  as  a  core  agricultural \nresearch  institute  with  the  use  of  counterpart  funds  generated  under  the  first  ASP.  MAFF  will \nalso  formulate  a  master  plan  for  agricultural  research,  and,  before  release  of  the  second \ntranche,  the  Government  will  approve  a  master  plan,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  start \nimplementing it. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB  provides  support  for  improved  technology  in  vegetable  production  (ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  for \nStrengthening  the  Collaborative  Vegetable  Research  Network  in  Cambodia,  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic, \nand Viet Nam [Phase II]. Manila. TA 6011- REG). \n\n\f14 \n\nThe  Government  has  been  trying  to  strengthen  agricultural  extension  services  despite \n48. \nfinancial  and  human  resource  constraints.  However,  high  absenteeism  of  public  extension \nworkers  is  still  seen  in  some  provinces  due  to  low  salaries  and  allowances.21  As  services \nprovided  by  NGOs  and  other  private  organizations  offer  limited  coverage,  public  agricultural \nextension services need to be further strengthened up to a required minimum, and the skills of \nfield staff improved to meet the needs of farm households. The Government will propose to the \nNational Assembly an increase in the 2004 recurrent budget of MAFF by at least 5% over 2003 \nto  provide  adequate  extension  services,  and  will  also  continue  to  provide  an  incremental \nincrease  in  the  annual  budget  for  agricultural  extension  during  ASDP.  Progress  will  be \nmonitored by ADB during the program period through its regular dialogue with the Government. \nIn addition,  before  release  of  the  second  tranche  of  the  program  loan,  the  Government  will \ninstitutionalize  the  revised  content  in  the  information-disseminating  programs  on  agricultural \ntechnology by improving the existing weekly information services, which started in 1997. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nA  program  loan  of  $25  million  equivalent  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  is \n49. \nproposed. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The annual \ninterest charge will be 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The Borrower will be \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  loan  will  be  utilized  over  the  program  period.  The  provision  of \nSpecial Funds resources is justified for Cambodia because of its low national income and weak \nbase for tax and non-tax revenues. \n \n\n4. \n\nProgram Adjustment Costs \n\n50. \nThe  total  adjustment  cost  to  carry  out  ASDP's  reform  measures  is  estimated  at  about \n$30  million,22  and  will  include  (i)  extension  support  related  to  social  land  concessions;  (ii) \ndivestment  of  public  enterprises;  (iii)  improved  market  information  services  and  quality  control \nfor traded agricultural inputs; and (iv) strengthening of agricultural support services. The social \nland  concession  programs  will  not  be  effective  unless  accompanied  by  land  titling  and \nagricultural  support  services  for  newly  entitled  smallholders.  Such  support  services  will  be \nrequired  during  the  second  half  of  the  ASDP  program  period,  and  their  costs  are  tentatively \nestimated  at  about  $4  million.  Compensation  payments  may  also  be  required  to  defray  the \nearlier investment costs of the concessionaires of unused and revoked economic concessions, \namounting to about $2 million. \n \nIn  the  divestment  of  public  enterprises,  cost  efficiency  is  expected  to  be  realized \n51. \ngradually over the medium term. In the short run, there will be costs required for the provision of \ncompensation  packages  for  some  redundant  staff.  In  the  case  of  SOREs,  the  process  will \nmainly  affect  administration  and  management  staff  or  about  5%  of  total  employees  (footnote \n19). In order to effect the divestment of rubber estates, provision of redundancy packages and \nsupport  services  may  also  be  required  for  possible  displaced  workers  from  the  counterpart \nfunds  the  loan  will  generate.  The  amount  needed  is  estimated  at  about  $2  million,  subject  to \ndirect  negotiations  between  the  Government  and  worker  representatives.  Under  ASDP,  MAFF \naims  to  improve  and  expand  its  agricultural  MIS,  which  was  introduced  during  the  first  ASP. \n\n                                                 \n21 An adequate incentive system is required for the staff engaged in agricultural research and extension, and needs \nto  be  combined  with  a  new  performance  appraisal  approach,  which  was  formulated  for  the  Department  of \nAgricultural Extension with assistance from the Government of Australia. \n\n22 This section is based on earlier estimates made under a TA (ADB. 2001.  Technical Assistance for Preparing the \nAgriculture  Sector  Development  Program .  Manila.  [TA  3695- CAM]),  and  ADB's  subsequent  discussions  with  the \nGovernment. \n\n\f15 \n\nMAFF  also  provides  regulatory  services  to  ensure  the  quality  of  various  agricultural  inputs \ntraded in the market. The estimated cost of these services is about $2 million. \n \n52. \nThe  introduction  of  the  MTEF  approach  into  the  agriculture  sector  will strengthen the \nlinkage  between  national  development  plans  and  annual  public  expenditures  for  the  sector.  A \nsubstantial increase in overall expenditures is required in the short run to finance a gap due to \nlimited  resources  allocated  for  agricultural  extension  services,  and  to  support  the  creation  of \nsustainable  services  in  the  medium  term.  The  overall  budget  ceiling  for  the  agriculture  sector \nneeds  to  be  increased  from  about  2%  to  5- 10%,  the  level  adopted  for  other  priority  sectors.23 \nADB  will  continue  close  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  other  major  external  funding \nagencies in view of the limited allocable budget ceiling for the sector and the slow progress in \noverall revenue increase. The adjustment cost for this purpose is estimated at about $20 million \nbased on the preliminary projection made for the MTEF exercise.24 \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Organization \n\n53.  MAFF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be the executing agencies \nfor  the  program  loan.  They  were  the  program  executing  agencies  for  the  first  ASP  and \nsuccessfully  completed  it.  MAFF25  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation  of \nASDP through an interministerial program secretariat, which includes the Council for Agricultural \nand Rural Development; Council for Land Policy; and the ministries of land management, urban \nplanning  and  construction;  rural  development;  water  resources  and  meteorology;  commerce; \ninterior;  and  women's  and  veterans'  affairs.  The  Government  has  already  established  the \nsecretariat, and appointed a program director, who heads it, and one full-time counterpart staff. \nMAFF will also establish a program support unit (PSU) before loan effectiveness to manage the \nday-to-day implementation of the program loan. The PSU will comprise a program manager, a \nmonitoring and evaluation officer, an accounting officer, and other necessary support staff. MEF \nwill monitor the use of loan proceeds and counterpart funds to be generated from the program \nloan. The secretariat will meet at least quarterly to review the progress of ASDP implementation \nand resolve any operational issues. ASDP's program implementation chart is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nb. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n54. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items  produced \nin  and  procured  from  ADB's  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6).  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds finance goods already imported, the value of \neligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) \nif the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately \npreceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal \nplus  all  other  am ounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  succeeding  1-year  period. \nProcurement will be carried out on the basis of either normal commercial practices satisfactory to \nADB for the private sector or the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures satisfac tory to \nADB for the public sector. \n \n                                                 \n23 World  Bank  and  ADB.  2003. \n\nIntegrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  and  Public  Expenditure  Review.  The  actual \n\nrequirement for the agriculture sector will be worked out during ASDP. \n\n24  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance.  2002.  The  Medium -Term  Expenditure  Framework  for  Cambodia:  2003\u20132005. \n\nPhnom Penh. \n\n25 MAFF's current staff strength is about 9,300 (3,772 in Phnom Penh and 5,522 elsewhere). \n\n\f16 \n\nc. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n55.  Counterpart funds generated from the program loan will become part of the Government\u2019s \nbudgetary resources. The funds will be used to support the reform measures in the agriculture \nsector  proposed  under  ASDP  as  the  first  priority;  and,  secondly,  to  finance  the  development \nexpenditures for agriculture and rural development. MEF will monitor the use of such funds. \n \n\nd. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports \n\n56. \nA  special  account  to  receive  loan  proceeds  will  be  established  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness  at  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  and  operated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook .  The  Government  will  manage,  operate,  and  liquidate  the  account  in \naccordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. All financial transactions of the special account will be \nrecorded separately in a manner that allows identification of expenditures from loan proceeds and \ncounterpart  funds.  The  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  will  be  audited  only upon \nADB's  request,  provided  that  ADB  retains  the  right  to  (i)  audit  any  accounts,  and  (ii)  verify  the \nvalidity  of  certification  issued  by  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  The  PSU,  in \ncollaboration with MEF, will prepare and furnish to the program secretariat and ADB a quarterly \nprogress report in form and detail satisfactory to the Government and ADB. Within 3 months of the \nloan closing date, the Government will also submit to ADB a detailed completion report on the \nprogram  loan  performanc e.  The  format  and  content  of  the  report  will  be  agreed  on  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n57. \nThe  interministerial  program  secretariat  will  monitor  program  performance  and  impact \nbased on ASDP's program framework. Program impact will be assessed particularly for the poor \nand women in the project provinces. Primary data collection disaggregated by gender and income \nwill  be  carried  out  by  district  extension  offices  in  the  provinces  selected  for  ASDP's  project \ncomponent and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project (footnote 26). In addition, \ninformation  collected  under  other  projects  of  ADB  and  other  external  funding  agencies  will  be \nused.  ADB's  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  will  keep  close  contact  with  the  relevant  government \nagencies and external funding agencies to remain updated on the status of such progress. The \nworking  group  on  agriculture  and  natural  resources  organized  by  external  funding  agencies  in \nCambodia will provide the venue for such consultation and coordination. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches  over  3  years  from  January  2004  to \n58. \nDecember 2006. The first tranche of $15 million equivalent will be available for release upon loan \neffectiveness, subject to full compliance with the first-tranche conditions. The second tranche of \n$10 million equivalent will be released approximately 30 months later, after compliance by the \nGovernment with the second-tranche conditions. \n \n\nf. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nDuring  divestment  of  SOREs,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  closure  or  downsizing  of  any \n59. \nparticular  estate  will  in  itself  force  rubber  smallholders  out  of  business  since  the  Government \nhas  already  shown  its  willingness  to  hand  over  to  estate  workers  or  encroaching  smallholders \nthe areas they are planting and harvesting rubber. However, there is a possibility, though less \nlikely, that the closure or downsizing of an estate may lead to establishment of other activities \ndisplacing either rubber or non-rubber smallholders or both. It is also necessary to address the \npossibility  of  any  adverse  social  impacts  that  may  result  from  the  divestment  of  AIC  and \n\n\f17 \n\nKAMFIMEX due to involuntary acquisition of assets and changes in land use. For this purpose, \na  resettlement  policy  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  has  been  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment  in  relation  to  divestment  of  state-owned  public  enterprises,  including  the  seven \nSOREs,  AIC,  and  KAMFIMEX.  ASDP's  program  executing  agencies  (para.  53)  will  be \nresponsible for providing compensation and rehabilitation assistance and, if required,  relocation \nand resettlement of people affected by ASDP's program measures.  \n \n60. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  acquisition  of \nassets,  resettlement  and  monitoring  activities  specified  in  any  agreed-on  resettlement  policy \nframework  and  resettlement  plans,  if  required,  and  will  meet  any  unforeseen  obligations  in \nexcess of the resettlement plan budget estimate to satisfy resettlement policy objectives.  The \nprogram  executing  agencies  will  engage  an  independent  external  monitor,  acceptable  to  ADB \nand  with  agreed-on  terms  of  reference,  to  monitor  and  evaluate  implementation  of  the \nresettlement policy framework and resettlement plans, if required. \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nto  achieve \n\nThe project loan will provide farmers with effective agricultural support services, and has \n61. \nincreased \nbeen  designed  as  a  pilot  project \ncommercialization of agriculture and reduce rural poverty. The project loan will help establish a \nmechanism  to  increase  participation  of  farming  households  in  the  rural  economy  through \nimproved productivity and diversification into more marketable, higher-value commodities (crop, \nlivestock, and fishery), and through greater integration of producers into marketing, processing, \nand  related  service  activities.  Together  with  the  JFPR  project,  the  project  loan  will  provide  a \nframework  for  future  MAFF  extension  activities  in  other  provinces  and  linkages  to  agro-based \nenterprise development. \n \n\nthe  ASDP's  objectives \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\na. \n\nExtension Support for Farmer Groups \n\n62. \nIn Cambodia, the potential for rice production to further enhance farmers\u2019 livelihoods is \nlimited.  The  small  size  of  landholdings  (usually  less  than  2  ha)  and  low  yields,  combined  with \ndemands  of  household  consumption  and  low  unit  value,  limit  the  size  and  value  of  any \nmarketable  surplus.  Although  some  opportunities  remain  to  increase  yield  of  rice  for  export, \nimprovements  in  household  incomes  for  rural  households  must  come  from  diversification into \nalternative  high-value  products  and  from  increased  participation  in  the  marketing  and \ndownstream  processing  of  agro-based  commodities  and  related  agribusiness  services.  Most \nfarmers, however, have limited access to new and improved technologies (knowledge, skills, or \ninputs), and are poorly organized to take advantage of either production or market opportunities. \nAs  shown  in  NGOs'  rural  development  projects  and  donor-supported  activities  through \nprovincial departments of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (PDAFFs), the use of farmer groups \nis not only effective for delivering support services to individual farmers but also enables such \nservices to offer an extended outreach to communes and villages.26 \n \n                                                 \n26  ADB's project under JFPR grant assistance provides synergies and complementarity of the NGO approach with the \nproject  component  of  ASDP  in  areas  where  intensive  socioeconomic  support  is  urgently  required.  (ADB. 2002. \nGrant  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Improving  the  Livelihood  of  Poor  Farmers  in  Southern \nCambodia. Manila. [JFPR 9027\u2013CAM for $1.8 million]). \n\n\f18 \n\nin \n\nthe  project  area, \n\nIn  selecting  communes \n\nUnder the project component of ASDP (the project), extension support will be provided \n63. \nfor  existing  and  new  farmer  groups.  The  project  will  cover  four  provinces  in  the  southern \nprovinces  of  Kompong  Cham,  Kompong  Speu,  Kampot,  and  Takeo,  and  be  primarily \nimplemented  by  provincial  and  district  agricultural  extension  staff.  These  provinces  were \nidentified  during  ASDP  formulation27  based  on  (i)  the  expected  impact  of  agricultural  growth  on \npoverty reduction; (ii) growth potential and accessibility; (iii) capacity of local institutions; and (iv) \npossible linkages and complementarity with other development activities, particularly ADB's Rural \nInfrastructure  Improvement  Project.28 \nthe \nGovernment will prioritize those that carry out social land concession programs or are affected \nby  divestment  of  SOREs  to  provide  adequate  extension  support  to  ensure  sustainable \nlivelihoods  of  the  beneficiaries  of  these  reforms.  During  the  midterm  review,  the  possibility  of \ntransferring  primary  responsibility  for  project  implementation  to  the  communes  will  be \nconsidered subject to their technical capability. \n \n64. \nThe  project  will  support  the  formation  of  new  farmer  groups  and  strengthen  existing \ngroups, and help build capacity of provincial and district agricultural extension staff. The project \nwill  also  facilitate  farmers'  access  to  quality  inputs  for  field  trials  (such  as  seeds,  seedlings, \nfertilizers  and  veterinary  medicines)  as  well  as  their  participation  in  capacity-building activities \n(field training, study tours,  and  group  meetings).  Prior  to  project  implementation,  stakeholder \nconsultation  meetings  will  be  held  in  the  four  project  provinces  to  present  the  details  of  the \nextension support component to key stakeholders. MAFF will also inform the general public of \nproject details through mass media and public communication materials. \n \n65. \nAgricultural extension offices will plan and provide technical training and other services \nto farmer groups. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of women farmers with respect to \nfunctional literacy programs and to the scheduling, materials and accommodation arrangements \nof  training  programs.  Special  consideration  will  also  be  given  to  farmers  of  ethnic  minorities \nregarding  the  composition  of  farmer  groups  and  contents  of  the  training  programs.  The \nextension  support  component  is  expected  to  benefit  about  2,800  farmer  groups  in  the  four \nproject provinces, comprising about 56,000 farmers. \n \n\nb. \n\nSupport Services for Agro-Based Enterprises \n\n66. \nCambodia has a large number of micro agroenterprises, each usually comprising a few \nfamily members and temporary workers. The enterprises are organized as sole proprietorships, \nrarely  registered,  and  do  not  rely  on  formal  credit  for  investment  capital.  To  integrate  farmers \ninto rapidly growing urban and international markets, it is important, particularly in rural areas, to \npromote market linkages between farmers and these enterprises and traders. However, growth \nof micro- and small-scale agroenterprises is constrained by weak infrastructure, limited access \nto  credit,  and  limited  information.  No  institutional  framework  provides  relevant  information  on \ntheir  common  issues  and  business  opportunities.  Even  the  simplest  data  on  how  many \nagroenterprises  operate  in  a  certain  area  and  in  which  field,  and  their  size,  are  not  easily \navailable outside Phnom Penh. With the exception of a few NGOs, no institutional mechanism \nprovides such business information and services to agroenterprises. \n \n\n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2001.

(Loan 1385\u2013CAM[SF] for $25.1 million). This \nproject rehabilitated about 500 kilometers of rural roads in the project area, and was completed in June 2002. \n\n\f19 \n\nUnder  the  project,  the  Government  will  introduce  agroenterprise  resource  services \n67. \n(ARS)  to  address  this  issue  and  provide  training,  counseling,  advisory  support,  and  export \npromotion.  Each  ARS  to  be  contracted  under  the  project  will  provide  (i)  training  programs  in \nfinancial planning and management, government regulations, compliance with WTO regulatory \nrequirements,  computer  skills  and  English;  (ii)  export  promotion  fairs  and  exhibitions;  and  (iii) \nsupport  to  form  trade  and  industry  associations,  including  women's  enterprise  associations. In \neach  province,  ARS  will  concentrate  on  specific  subsectoral  opportunities  rather  than \ndeveloping a standard model to cover all agroenterprises. ARS will use appropriate facilities at \nprovincial  towns,  including  the  existing  provincial  women  in  development  centers.  The \nexperience of a few NGOs implies that each ARS will have about 880 beneficiaries, and a total \nof  4,400  by  the  end  of  the  project  period.  International  and  national  NGOs,  and  local  private \nsector enterprises will be able to provide ARS in the project provinces. ARS may be eventually \ntransferred to local business associations or chambers of commerce and industry. \n \n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening for Agricultural Commercialization \n\nIn  the  agriculture  sector,  public  institutions  to  promote  marketing  and  export  of  agro-\n68. \nbased  products  are  still  weak  and  cannot  facilitate  trade  and  services  in  the  private  sector \neffectively.  A  major  constraint  on  promotion  of  agro-based  exports  is  failure  to  meet \ninternationally  required  quality  and  safety  standards  in  markets  abroad.  As  agricultural \ndiversification  and  commercialization  progress,  compliance  with  such  standards  for  an \nincreasing  range  of  agricultural  exports  will  become  even  more  important.  To  address  these \nissues,  the  institutional  strengthening  component  of  the  project  will  provide  support  (training \nprograms,  seminars,  equipment,  and  office  facilities)  to  relevant  agricultural  institutions, \nincluding  MAFF's  departments  of  agro-industry; agricultural legislation; and planning, statistics \nand international cooperation. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Cost Estimates \n\n69. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $5.88  million  equivalent,  comprising  $1.73  million  or \n29%  of  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $4.15  million  or  71%  of  local  currency  costs.

The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years.  The  annual  interest  charge  will  be  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the project and 72% of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  high  proportion  of  local  cost  financing  by  ADB  is  necessary  in  view  of  the \nhigh  percentage  of  local  currency  expenditures  under  the  project  and  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nconstraints. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The balance of $1.18 million will be \nfinanced  by  the  Government.  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2,  and  details  are  in \nAppendix 7.

MAFF and MEF will be the executing agencies for the project. MAFF will be responsible \nfor  overall  project  implementation,  and  establish  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  in  the \nprogram secretariat of MAFF before loan effectiveness. The PCU will have a project coordinator \nappointed by MAFF from the Department of Agricultural Extension, and necessary support staff. \nMEF  will  monitor  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  provide  adequate  budget  to  support  project \nactivities,  and  ensure  proper  financial  management  for  the  project  loan.  The  project  will  also \ninvolve (i) the Seila Task Force at the central level; (ii) respective provincial rural development \ncommittees,  their  executive  committee  secretariats  and  PDAFFs  at  the  provincial  level;  (iii) \ndistrict-based extension staff of PDAFFs; and (iv) commune councils. The executive committee \nsecretariats  of  the  provincial  rural  development  committees  will  agree  with  PDAFF  on  the \nannual work program at the beginning of the year, and PDAFF will implement the agreed annual \nwork program for the project according to schedule. Project activities will be financed by funds \nwithdrawn from the project imprest account. \n \n72. \nUnder  the  extension  support  component,  appropriate  selection  criteria  for  project \nbeneficiaries,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  established.  During  selection  of  beneficiaries,  MAFF \nwill ensure that at least 50% of the members of farmer groups come from poor households and \nthat  at  least  50%  of  participating  farmer  group  members  are  women.  Indicative  criteria  for  the \npoor households will generally include  (i)  a  large  number  of  dependents,  including  more  than \nfive children, and disabled and elderly  people; (ii) vulnerable, female household heads; (iii) less \nthan 0.75 ha per household and high dependence on rain-fed agriculture; (iv) inadequate food-\ngrain  production  for  family  consumption  and  dependence  upon  seasonal  borrowing;  or  (v) \nilliteracy  or  less  than  3  years  of  primary  education.  Beneficiaries  should  be  able  to  work  and \nlearn together in a group, and keen to participate in the project. \n \n\nb. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n73. \nProcurement  of  civil  works,  service  vehicles  and  equipment  should  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works to be procured under the project \nare rehabilitation of agricultural extension offices and expected to be in small packages costing \nless  than  $100,000.  International  companies  are  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding  for  these \nlocal civil works, which will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory \nto ADB. Packages for some service vehicles, which are likely to exceed $100,000 and can be \nsourced  more  effectively  from  international  suppliers,  will  be  procured  through  international \nshopping  procedures.  Where  appropriate,  procurement  may  be  by  direct  purchase  for  items \nbelow $100,000. \n \n74.  MEF will arrange to open a dollar imprest account for the project with the National Bank \nof Cambodia immediately after loan effectiveness. The account will be managed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  the  Government's  project  accounting  manual. \nMEF will delegate administration of this account to the PCU through arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB.  An  initial  amount  will  be  deposited  into  the  account  based  on  the  projected \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  but  will  not  exceed  $500,000.  The  account  will  be \nreplenished based on withdrawal applications submitted through MEF to ADB from time to time. \nLoan proceeds will be made available from the central project account to the provincial project \naccounts. Project funds will be disbursed through PDAFF's provincial and district offices for civil \nworks,  locally  purchased  vehicles  and  equipment,  contractual  staff,  training,  and  locally \n\n\f22 \n\n76. \n \n\nrecruited  service  providers  and  consultants.  The  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  and \nreplenished  according  to  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  for  payments  below \n$50,000.  Payment  for  the  institutional  strengthening  component  and  a  part  of  the  contract \npayments for support services for agroenterprises will be made by the PCU. \n \n\nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n75. \nThe  project  will  finance  a  team  of  consultants,  including  (i)  21  person-months  of \ninternational consultants in extension services, and environmental management and monitoring; \nand  (ii)  254  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  in  project  management  and  coordination, \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  agricultural  extension.  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  provide  these  services.  The  extension  project  advisor \n(international  consultant)  will  act  as  the  team  leader,  and  the  project  management  and \ncoordination specialist as the deputy team leader. The selection and engagement of consultants \nwill be done with ADB's standard quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  these  consulting \nservices are in Appendix 8. \n \n\nd. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe project implementation period will be 5 years from January 2004 to December 2008. \n\ne. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports \n\n77. \nThe PCU will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditures and have them \naudited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nprinciples.  All  financial  transactions  for  the  project  will  be  recorded  separately  in  the  project \naccount in a manner that allows identification of expenditures under the project. Certified copies \nof  such  audited  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB,  in  English,  within  9  months  after  the  end  of \neach fiscal year. To meet these requirements, the PCU will set up a project accounting system \nin accordance with MEF accounting guidelines. The PCU will compile quarterly progress reports \non  overall  project  implementation,  which  will  be  submitted  to  the  interministerial  program \nsecretariat  and  ADB  before  the  end  of  the  month  following  the  quarter  under  review.  The \nGovernment will also prepare and furnish to ADB a midterm review report at the end of the third \nyear  of  project  implementation  and  a  project  completion  report  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion. These reports will be in a form and have details satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nf. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  PCU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  project  performance  and  impact.  It  will \n78. \nestablish  an  appropriate  monitoring  system  with  assistance  from  project  implementation \nconsultants  as  part  of  the  management  information  system  linked  with  the  interministerial \nprogram  secretariat.  Baseline  data  and  information  on  environmental  and  social  aspects  of \nASDP have been developed through detailed field surveys during project formulation and will be \nused to develop the monitoring system. The social impact indicators developed and used for the \nJFPR  project  will  be  fully  taken  into  account.  In  addition  to  regular  project  supervision,  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  on  project \nperformance and impact. During the midterm review, project implementation arrangements will \nbe  closely  reviewed  in  view  of  the  progress  of  the  Government's  decentralization policy. The \n\n\f23 \n\nproject  completion  review  will  be  carried  out  upon  project  completion  based  on  the  terms  of \nreference to be agreed between the Government and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n79. \nIn  conjunction  with  ASDP,  an  advisory  TA  is  required  to  provide  the  Government  with \ntechnical and advisory support for the proposed policy and institutional reform measures in the \nagriculture sector. The TA will cover three main areas: (i) strengthening of MAFF's institutional \ncapacity  in  agricultural  policy  planning,  program  budgeting  and  marketing  services;  (ii)  further \ndivestment  of  state-owned  public  enterprises  in  the  agriculture  sector;  and  (iii)  establishment \nand development of national agricultural research and extension systems. The total cost of the \nTA is estimated at $1,180,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  balance  of  TA  costs \namounting  to  $180,000  equivalent  will  be  met  by  the  Government's  own  resources  to  cover \ncounterpart  staff  support,  office  accommodation  and  supplies,  and  part  of  field  transport.  The \nexecuting agency for the TA will be MAFF. The selection and engagement of the consultants for \nthe TA will be done by ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB's \nstandard quality- and cost-based selection method will be used, and technical proposals invited \nfrom the shortlisted consulting firms will be in ADB\u2019s simplified formats.  The TA  will be carried \nout  over  3  years,  and  will  require  services of an international consulting firm,  consisting of 29 \nperson-months  of  international  consultants  and  28  person-months  of  domestic  consultants in \nagricultural  policy  planning,  corporate  management,  public  expenditure  management, \nagricultural  research,  social  and  gender  analysis,  and  law.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 9. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProgram Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts \n\nPoverty  and  social  impact  assessments  for  ASDP  are  summarized  in  Appendix  10. \n80. \nASDP  will  address  current  issues  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  generate  positive  impacts  on \npoverty reduction in the medium to long term by increasing employment and income-generating \nopportunities for the rural poor. The project component to support farmer groups will generate \ndirect  benefits  to  poor  farmers  as  at  least  50%  of  the  farmer  group  members  will  be selected \nfrom  the  poor.  Farmers'  linkage  with  markets  and  alternative  income-generating opportunities \nwill be strengthened through agricultural commercialization and diversification enhanced under \nASDP, and through provision of support services for local small-scale agro-based enterprises. \n \n81.  Mainstreaming  gender  issues  in  the  agriculture  sector  will  be  a  major  consideration \nunder  ASDP.  Ministry  of  Women's  and  Veterans'  Affairs,  which  is  the  primary  government \nagency  engaged  in  gender  issues,  has been included in ASDP's program secretariat, and the \nministry's  provincial  departments  will  be  involved  in  the  extension  support  component  of  the \nproject.  ASDP  will  help  mainstream  women  in  agricultural  production  by  ensuring  that  at  least \n50% of participating farmers are women. ADB will regularly monitor field activities to ensure that \ngender  issues  are  fully  taken  into  account  according  to  an  action  plan  drafted  for  ASDP \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  ASDP  will  also  assist  MAFF  in  formulating  and  implementing a \nsector-wide  policy  and  strategy  for  mainstreaming  gender  issues  under  the  program  loan  and \n\n\f24 \n\nTA  in  coordination  with  other  gender-related  activities.29  No  negative  gender  issues  are \nenvisaged during ASDP implementation. \n \n82. \nDuring  divestment  of  public  enterprises  under  the  program  component  of  ASDP, \nliquidation of unsustainable public enterprises may result in some redundancies in the short run. \nThe Government prepared and approved a divestment plan for SOREs in 1998, which needs to \nbe updated and revised based on accurate information on the estates' financial positions, asset \nvalue, and workforce. The seven SOREs have about 15,500 employees, of whom about 12,000 \ncasual  workers  are  engaged  in  rubber  planting,  production  and  transport  activities  on  a \ncontractual  basis.  The  remaining  employees  include  managerial  and  administrative  staff, \nteachers, health workers, security guards, and drivers. Most employees likely to be affected by \ndivestment will be less poor, managerial staff. Teachers and health workers are expected to be \nabsorbed  into  the  ministries  or  provincial  authorities  and  to  receive  adequate  compensation \npackages. Regarding AIC (55 staff) and KAMFIMEX (about 300 staff), actual conditions will be \ndetermined  through  negotiations  during  divestment  between  the  Government  and  worker \nrepresentatives.  The  Government  assured  ADB  that  adequate  compensation  will  be  made  in \naccordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  stipulated  in  the  Labor  Law.30 A resettlement policy \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  has  also  been  prepared  and  agreed  on  with  the \nGovernment  to  address  possible  inadequacy  of  legal  provisions  in  Cambodia,  and  to  ensure \nASDP's compliance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n83. \nThe  subdecree  for  social  land  concessions  has  been  finalized  through  a  series  of \nstakeholder  consultations  under  ADB  TA  (footnote  16).  The  subdecree  and  related \nimplementation  guidelines  provide  adequate  safeguard  measures  against  any  adverse  social \neffects,  which  will  be  further  specified  based  on a pilot social land concession program to be \ncarried out under the World Bank's ongoing Land Management and Administration Project. ADB \nwill  closely  monitor  the  progress  of  social  land  concession  programs,  and  will  further  discuss \nthis policy measure with the Government during ASDP. \n \n84. \nIn the project provinces, the mainly Muslim Cham people are the major ethnic minority \ngroup,  constituting  about  5%  of  the  total  population.  They  are  lowland  farmers,  with  the  same \nlifestyle  as  the  dominant  Khmer  people.  Other  ethnic  minority  groups  include  Vietnamese, \nChinese,  and  Suoy  (mainly  in  Kampong  Speu).  No  negative  impact  on  these  ethnic  minority \ngroups is foreseen under ASDP. Special consideration will be given to them and their practices \nwhen they intend to form farmer groups to participate in the extension support activities of the \nproject. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n85. \nThe  potential  environmental  impact  of  ASDP  was  assessed  in  an  initial  environmental \nexamination and is summarized in Appendix 11. The adoption of a less interventionist approach \nwithin  a  more  market-oriented  policy  framework  will  generally  enhance  the  efficient  use  of \nnatural resources in the agriculture sector, thereby resulting in positive environmental impacts. \nIncreased  productivity  of  agricultural  land  with  better  access  to  improved  inputs  and  water \nresources  will  reduce  the  pressure  to  clear  and  cultivate  elevated  lands,  which  are  less  fertile \nand  have  lower  potential  for  sustainable  use.  With  increased  commercialization  and \n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Sustainable  Employment  Promotion  for  Poor \n\nWomen. Manila. (TA 3947- CAM). \n\n30  Divestment  of  the  Cambodia  Pharmaceutical  Enterprise,  which  was  privatized  in  1996,  was  completed  through \ndirect  negotiations  between  the  investor  and  the  Government,  and  based  on  the  requirements  specified  in  the \nLabor Law (minimum notice period before separation and severance benefits). \n\n\f25 \n\ndiversification of agricultural production, ASDP may generally increase the use of agrochemicals \nfor  the  production  of  high-value  products.  According  to  the  field  survey  conducted  for  ASDP \npreparation, about 70% of farmers use at least one type of inorganic fertilizer, with an average \nuse  of  about  68  kg  of  fertilizers  per  production  season  (or  40  kg/ha),31  which  is  substantially \nlower than the average use in Asia. With increased awareness among farm households about \nthe proper use of agrochemicals under ASDP, the potential environmental risk of their increased \nuse will be minimal. ASDP will also have a positive environmental impact through an improved \nregulatory system to ensure the quality of agrochemicals traded in the market. ASDP activities \nunder  the  project  will  not  be  carried  out  in  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Other  impacts \nwill be indirect on environment through second- or third-generation products of ASDP in relation \nto the use of land and water resources. Appropriate measures have been considered to mitigate \nany  possible  adverse  impacts  on  environment.  Consulting  services  engaged  in  the  project  will \nalso  assist  the  Government  in  environmental  management  and  monitoring.  A  full-scale \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial and Economic Impacts \n\n86. \nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  for  ASDP  have  been  carried  out  and  summarized  in \nAppendix  12.  ASDP  will  promote  adequate  fiscal  allocations  to  facilitate  agricultural  growth  in \nline  with  SEDPII  and  NPRS,  and  help  improve  the  country's  fiscal  situation  through  potential \nrevenue  collections  from  the  agriculture  sector.  ASDP  will  also  shift  the  focus  of  public \nexpenditures  in  the  agriculture  sector  to  local  administrations  in  line  with  the  Government's \ndecentralization  policy  so  that  the  sector  budget  will  be  allocated  to  areas  where  local  needs \nand demands are more directly reflected. \n \n87. \nIndicative  farm  budgets  and  cropping  patterns  were  used  to  assess  the  farm-level \nfinancial  cost  and  benefit  streams  of  the  expected,  gradual  farmers'  shifts  to  more  intensive \nproduction of high-value products. The project component of ASDP will result in diversification of \nproducts  by  smallholders,  an  improved  environment  for  agro-based  enterprises,  and  capacity \nbuilding of agricultural institutions. Extension support will also facilitate adoption of improved paddy \nproduction during the wet season.  Realization  of  the  full  development  potential  is  assumed  to \ntake  4  years,  gradually  building  up  from  25%  in  the  first  year,  when  a  household  becomes  a \nmember of a farmer group. \n \n88. \nIn calculating the economic internal rate of return for the project, economic prices have \nbeen estimated based on the farm-gate financial prices for outputs and inputs with the use of a \nworld price numeraire. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 has been used for nontraded items, \nand  economic  budgets  were  estimated  for  all  of  the  crops  under  the  with- and without-project \nsituations for extension support. The economic internal rate of return for the base-case scenario \nis  estimated  at  39%,  and  a  standard  sensitivity  analysis  shows  the  economic  viability  of  the \nproject component. \n \nB. \n\nProgram Risks \n\nASDP  was  formulated  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  Government  remains \n89. \ncommitted to the market-oriented development of the agriculture sector in line with SEDPII, and \nto  the  policy  for  increased  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification.  This  commitment \n\n                                                 \n31  The average size of land holdings in the surveyed area was about 1.7 ha (ADB. 2001.  Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Agriculture Sector Development Program . Manila. [TA 3695- CAM] Annex \n13). \n\n\f26 \n\nhas  been  repeatedly  stated  by  the  Government  at  various  stages  and  reconfirmed  to  ADB \nmissions and through the development policy letter of the Government (Appendix 4). \n \n90. \nThe program risk related to the access to land resources is availability of land for social \nland  concession  programs,  which  will  be  hampered  if  an  adequate  amount  of  productive  land \ncannot be made available. ADB conducted a series of dialogue on this issue, and considers that \nan in-depth survey is required for each potential program for social land concessions based on \nthe  outcome  of  the  pilot  program  (para.  83),  and  substantial  progress  needs  to  be  made  in \nreducing unused economic land concessions.  Adequate control over competition for such lands \nis  also  required.  ADB  is  helping  the  Government  establish  implementation  guidelines  for  the \nsocial  land  concession  subdecree  and  formulating  a  draft  subdecree  on  economic  land \nconcessions through an ongoing TA for land legislation. ADB will also provide TA in conjunction \nwith  ASDP  to  ensure  close  monitoring  of  implementation  and  effective  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment during the program period. \n \n91. \nThere  is  a  political  risk  related  to  divestment  of  state-owned public enterprises. ADB's \nexperience  suggests  that  divestment  requires  a  series  of  careful  and  skillful  dialogues  since \nstrong  resistance  may  come  from  people  with  vested  interests in continuing such enterprises. \nThe divestment of the state-owned enterprises was decided by the Cabinet in December 2002. \nProvision of ADB's TA in conjunction with ASDP will enhance this process. Support from other \nexternal funding agencies to establish  an efficient agriculture sector, particularly the rubber and \nfishery subsectors, is expected to facilitate the divestment process. \n \n92. \nAn effective public-private partnership is important to successfully implement the agreed \nreform measures for (i) a legal and institutional framework for better access to improved seeds; \n(ii) a regulatory system to ensure the quality of agrochemicals traded in the market; (iii) activities \nto  comply  with  WTO  requirements;  (iv)  national  coordination  of  agricultural  research activities; \nand  (v)  improved  quality  and  expansion  of  public  agricultural  extension  services.  Close \nstakeholder  consultations  will  continue  to  be  carried  out  during  ASDP  implementation  to \nstrengthen  and  maintain  a  partnership  between  the  private  sector  and  the  Government.  ADB \nreview missions will help strengthen this process. \n \nThe risk related to the project loan that farmers may not adopt improved technology and \n93. \ninputs  is  minimal  as  farmers  showed  strong  demand  for  them  at  various  on-farm trials and on \nfield days. The degree of farmers' adoption of new products and improved technology is closely \nrelated to the marketing potential of such products. In the south where the project loan will be \nimplemented, farmers' demand for improved seeds and extension support is high in soybeans, \nyard long beans, mungbeans, and cherry tomatoes, reflecting the good marketing potentials of \nthese crops and local market conditions. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n94. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions taken prior to \nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  program  loan,  as  described  in  the \n\n\f27 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\nfor \n\nto  assess  any  possible  requirements \n\ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration of the ASDP loan \nand  subsequently;  (b)  promptly  adopt  the  other  policies  and  take  the  other \nactions  included  in  ASDP  as  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and the \npolicy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for \nthe duration of the program loan period and subsequently. \nThe  Government  will  provide  beneficiaries  of  social  land  concession  programs \nand estate workers of divested SOREs with adequate extension support. \nThe Government will ensure that adequate social safeguards satisfactory to ADB, \ninvoluntary \nincluding  measures \nresettlements  that  could  arise  from  ASDP  and  to  prepare  resettlement plans, if \nrequired, will be incorporated in ASDP. \nThe Government will ensure that acquisition of assets, compensation, relocation, \nand  resettlement  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  policy \nframework  and  the  resettlement  plans,  if  required,  agreed  on  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, the Borrower's laws, regulations, and procedures, and the \nADB's requirements as defined in the ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \nand  the  Handbook  on  Resettlement.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the \nBorrower's laws, regulations, and procedures, and ADB's requirements, the latter \nshall apply. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  appropriate  arrangements  are  made  to \nredeploy within the Government, staff, who are separated through divestment of \nSOREs,  AIC,  and  KAMFIMEX;  or  (b)  adequate  compensation  payments  are \nprovided to them in accordance with terms and conditions stipulated in the Labor \nLaw and ADB's relevant policies. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  an  adequate  incremental  increase  in  annual \nbudget allocations is made for the agriculture sector above the level of budgetary \nallocations \nin  extension  services,  and \nincorporated into the MTEF. \nThe Government will ensure timely implementation of MAFF's work program for \n2001\u20132005 to follow up on activities initiated under the first ASP. \n\nfor  MAFF,  particularly \n\nfor  2004 \n\nThe Project Loan \n\nIn the implementation of the project loan, the Government will ensure that (a) at \nleast 50% of the members of farmer groups will come from poor households; (b) \nat  least  50%  of  the  members  of  farmer  groups  are  women;  and  (c)  equal \nopportunities  for  the  project  benefits  will  be  available  for  ethnic  minority  groups \nwhen they intend to form farmer groups and participate in the project, and special \nconsideration given to their farming practices and culture. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n95.  MAFF will establish the PSU for the program loan and the PCU for the project loan, and \nappoint necessary counterpart staff for these units. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n96. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n\f28 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 17,485,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Agriculture Sector Development Program from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,287,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development Project from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\n30 October 2003 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n\fAppendix 1     29 \n\nAGRICULTURE SECTOR IN CAMBODIA \n\nCrop Production \n\nA. \n \nCambodia's agriculture is dominated by rice cultivation, which takes up about 2.3 million \n1. \nhectares (ha) or 90% of the total cropped area, mainly in the lowland areas along the Mekong \nRiver  and  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  There  are  two  main  seasons  for  rice  production.  Dry-season rice, \nwhich accounts for about 0.8 million tons (t) or 20% of total rice production of about 4.0 million t, \nis  cultivated  from  December  to  March,  mainly  for  sale,  and  largely  consists  of  high-yielding \nvarieties developed under the project supported by the International Rice Research Institute and \nthe  Government  of  Australia.  The  yield  of  dry-season  rice  was  estimated  at  about  3.2  t/ha  in \n2001. Wet-season rice, which accounts for about 3.2 million t or 80% of total rice production, is \nusually  cultivated  from  May  to  September, and consists mainly of local varieties for domestic \nconsumption.  Average  yield  is  about  1.9  t/ha.  While  the  average  annual  production  growth  of \ndry-season  rice  from  1996  to  2000  (4.8%)  exceeded  that  of  wet  season  rice  (2.8%), \nCambodians  prefer  the  taste  and  quality  of  local  varieties  and  so  continue  to  grow  them. \nFarmers\u2019  access  to  irrigation  water  is  still  significantly  limited,  with  the  irrigated  area  for  rice \nestimated at about 473,000 ha in 1997/98 or about 16% of the total rice area, which is mostly for \nsupplementary  wet-season irrigation.  During  the  past  decade,  the  country  has  become  self-\nsufficient in rice and is able to export a modest surplus. Even though the exact amount of this \nsurplus  is  not  known  due  to  the  largely  informal  nature  of  the  rice  trade,  it  is  estimated  that \nabout 400,000 t of paddy and about 50,000 t of milled rice were exported in 2001. \n \n2. \nOther major crops are maize (71,500 ha), vegetables (33,800 ha), soybean (33,300 ha), \nmung  bean  (25,000  ha),  sesame  (19,200  ha),  cassava  (16,300  ha),  peanut  (10,400  ha), \nsugarcane  (7,700  ha),  and  sweet  potato  (7,400  ha).  Maize  production  grew  rapidly  at  an \naverage rate of about 11% per annum from 1991 to 2000, particularly as a result of improved \nyields and increasing demand for animal feed due to the rapid growth of the poultry industry in \nrecent years. The increasing demand for animal feed in the country and in neighboring countries \nis  highly  advantageous  for  Cambodia.  Maize  is  mainly  produced  in  Kampong  Cham Province \nand other areas in the southern region. Farmers sell their products to traders at the farm gate or \nat  village  markets.  Vegetable  production  is  difficult  to  interpret.  Official  statistics  report  an \naverage  annual  decline  of  2%  during  1991\u20132000,  possibly  reflecting  the  impact  of  some \nunofficial  imports  from  Viet  Nam,  which  may  have  destabilized  the  domestic  market  and \nundermined  incentives  for  local  growers  to  produce  vegetables.  However,  actual  production, \nincluding  unrecorded  home-garden  production,  is  thought  to  be  substantially  greater.  Over  the \nlast decade, soybean production declined marginally, but the last 5 years have seen substantial \ngrowth  by  over  10%  per  annum  with  about  70%  of  production  going  to  Viet  Nam.  Yields  and \nquality, however, remain low and vary among producing areas. The limited growth in output of \nmung beans at 1.7% over the decade masks a strong decline of 5.0% over the last five years, \nparticularly concentrated in the dry season crop. Kampong Cham and Kandal provinces are the \nprimary  producing  areas  of  mung  beans,  which  are  traded  in  bulk  at  markets  in  Phnom  Penh \ntogether  with  soybeans,  sesame,  and  peanuts.  These  markets  in  Phnom  Penh  function  as \nintermediate markets to transport vegetables and other products to other provinces. \n \n3. \nSesame  production  expanded  rapidly  at  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  about  20% \nover the last 5 years, with a significant increase in cultivated area. Sesame is mainly produced \nin  the  southern  provinces  along  the  Mekong  River  before  major  flooding  starts.  Cassava \nproduction also grew rapidly during the 1990s at an average annual growth rate of about 11% \ndue  largely  to  increasing  demand  from  the  starch  industry  in  the  country  and  abroad.  Peanut \nproduction  achieved  reasonable  growth  overall  at  7%  per  annum  largely  because  of  yield  and \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\narea  growth  in  the  5  years  before  1996.  Sugarcane  production  fell  in  the  last  five  years  at  an \naverage annual rate of over 5%, reversing a positive trend in the early 1990s largely as a  result \nof a decline in yield. A similar large decline occurred in output of sweet potato during 1996\u20132000 \nby  an  average  annual  rate  of  over  6%.  This  is  the  result  of  a  decline  in  area  and  yield,  which \nwas a response in part to its low value compared to rice and maize.  \n \n4. \nOther industrial crops include rubber (36,400 ha), tobacco (9,700 ha) and jute (200 ha). \nTobacco  and  jute  have  been  in  decline  over  the  last  10  years.  The  area  tapped  for  rubber \nproduction  has  been  declining  by  about  2%  per  annum  over  the  last  decade.  The  decline  in \nrubber production has further accelerated since 1996. The yield of rubber is expected to further \ndecline in the medium term since the pace of rubber replanting cannot compensate for old trees \ncoming  out  of  production.  Seven  state-owned  rubber  estates  (SOREs)  dominate  the  rubber \nsector  with  31,000  ha  or  85%  of  the  total  area  in  production.  Although  external  auditing  is \nrequired to obtain reliable information on the estates' financial performance, the conditions of all \nthe  SOREs  except  for  one  estate  have  been  generally  deteriorating  as  they  lack  funds  for \nreplanting of old trees. The Government must update and revise the 1998 divestment plan for \nSOREs  and  expedite  divestment.  Another  1,000  ha  are  in  the hands of the Rubber Research \nInstitute  of  Cambodia.  There  is  a  growing  smallholder  sector  (about  4,400  ha),  including \ngrowers  supported  by  the  Government  of  France.  Total  rubber  production  in  Cambodia  was \nabout 38,650 t of dried rubber in 2001, of which 36,460 t were exported. Over the last decade, \nexports have ranged from $20 million to $40 million largely as a result of variations in the world \nprice, which after a period of decline now seems to be recovering slightly. \n \n5. \nCambodian rubber has reportedly been discounted in world markets by as much as 15\u2013\n20%1 because of quality and supply inconsistency. Smallholder rubber is often produced in the \nform  of  coagulates,  the  export  of  which  by  smallholders  is  banned.  This  has  rendered  the \nsmallholders dependent on state-owned estates to process and sell rubber, which accounts for \nthe  low  revenue  of  smallholders.  At  present,  private  firms  are  not  active  in  the  rubber  sector. \nThere  are  two  small  private  estates  for  rubber  production,  but  no  private  firms  are  involved  in \nprocessing. There were a few plans in the past for the private sector to start rubber processing, \nbut these plans did not materialize. The Government's policy for the rubber sector is to increase \nefficiency  in  estate  rubber  production  by  disinvesting  the  state-owned  rubber  estates  and \npromoting private interests. This policy also supports the expansion of smallholder production, \nwhich  is  the  prevalent  form  of  rubber  production  in  major  rubber  producing  countries  in \nSoutheast Asia, accounting for 80% of the world's production. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nLivestock  as  a  source  of  food,  income,  and  draught  power  is  an  integral  element  in \nimproving  rural  livelihoods  for  smallholders  and  the  landless.  The  Government  has  long \nemphasized  better  animal  health,  husbandry,  and  nutrition  in  its  livestock  policy.  The \nGovernment has recently drafted a strategy, the main thrust of which is control of trade-related \ndiseases  in  villages,  where  most  animals  are  held,  to  support  commercialization  of  livestock \nactivities as a source of supplementary farm income. The European Commission is to help the \nGovernment conduct a comprehensive study of the livestock sector to determine the need for \nsupport in animal health, marketing, and institutional reform. \n \n\nOther Subsectors \n\n                                                 \n1  A report on the performance of the smallholder project in January 2002 suggested the level of discount was as high \n\nas 30%. \n\n\fAppendix 1     31 \n\nFish has traditionally been the primary source of animal protein for Cambodian people.2 \n7. \nOfficial  statistics  indicate  that  people  engaged  in  fishing  constitute  about  2%  of  the  total labor \nforce, but underestimate the large number of people in small-scale fishing and fish catch in their \nrice  fields  as  a  major  source  of  livelihood.  A  different  estimate  indicated  that  fishery  provides \nmain employment to about 9% of the population, and secondary employment to 27%. Inland fish \ncatch  mainly  comes  from  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake,  with  small-scale  rice-field  fishing  constituting \nabout  20%  of  the  total.  Marine  catch  is  estimated  at  about  30,000  t,  but  is  grossly \nunderestimated because a large part of  the  catch  is  not  translated  into  fish  landings  but  sold \ndirectly  offshore.  Total  catch  in  2001  was  about  194,500  t  (135,000  inland,  42,000  marine, \n17,500 aquaculture). \n \n8. \nFishery  is  a  significant  export,  amounting  to  about  $4  million  in  2001.  Exports  and \nproduction  fluctuate  widely  year  on  year,  but  catches  have  grown  at  about  4%  per  annum  on \naverage  over  the  last  5  years.  In  the  past,  exports  were  totally  controlled  by  the  Kampuchea \nFishery Import and Export (KAMFIMEX), a government agency. It was turned into a financially \nautonomous  state-owned  enterprise  in  September  2002,  and  needs  to  compete  with  other \nprivate enterprises on an equal footing with the private sector. Fishing has been regulated by a \nsystem  of  fishing  concessions  or  lots.  Recently,  the  number  of  lots  has  been  reduced \nsubstantially  (from  235  covering  about  1  million  ha,  to  164  covering  around  400,000  ha).  The \nobjective is to release more than half the fishing lots to local communities. The mechanism to \nmanage these community fisheries is being determined. Aquaculture has also increasingly been \nsupported at the village level and has grown at about 9% per annum over the last decade, and \nnow accounts for about 10% of marketed production. Processing is constrained  by the lack of \nconstant  supplies,  a  situation  more  acute  for  freshwater  than  marine  fisheries,  although  the \nlatter are also affected by inshore poaching by unlicensed foreign vessels. \n \n9. \nForestry  has  declined  in  importance  in  recent  years  largely  because  of  the  ban  on  the \nexport of logs starting in 1996 and revocation of forest concessions.3 In 2001 forestry accounted \nfor only 6% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product compared with over 12% before \nthe  First  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (1996\u20132000)  period.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to \nintroduce  a  mechanism  for  sustainable  management  of  forest  resources  agreeable  to  all  key \nstakeholders. Community forests, which constitute still less than 1% of the total forest area, are \nbeing promoted, but are still restricted due to complications associated with land titling. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe mandate of Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) is based on the \nsubdecree  issued  in  April  2000,  which  stipulated  that  the  ministry  is  responsible  for  facilitating \nthe development of market-oriented agriculture sector by formulating sector policies, facilitating \ntechnology  improvement  and  establishing  regulatory  standards.  MAFF  is  still  in  a  period  of \ntransition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  market-oriented  system.  There  is  substantial  room  to \nupgrade  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  central  and  local  MAFF  staff.  MAFF  has  four  groups, \nincluding the Rubber General Directorate, and 12 line departments. The total number of MAFF \n                                                 \n2  Fish products account for about 70% of total animal protein intake, and Cambodians consume an average of about \n\nInstitutional Framework in the Agriculture Sector \n\nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries \n\n1. \n\n30 kilograms of fish a year. \n\n3  Licenses for 15 companies, which operated on 22 sites covering a total of about 3 million ha, had been revoked by \nJune  2002,  leaving  14  companies  with  licenses  to  exploit  timber  on  19  sites  covering  about  4  million  ha.  New \nregulations,  however,  have  suspended  these  operations  as  well  pending  the  approval  of  sustainable  forest \nmanagement plans. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nstaff  was  9,036  in  March  2002  (3,495  central,  and  5,541  local).  There  are  large  differences  in \nstaff  numbers  among  the  12  line  departments  due  to  staff  increases  in  the  past  for  some \ndepartments.  MAFF  recognizes  the  need  to  reallocate  staff  among  departments  according  to \nthe  newly  stipulated  functions  of  the  departments.  Under  MAFF's  control  there  are  two \nagricultural  colleges,  one  university  of  agriculture,  two  research  institutes,  and  nine  economic \nenterprises, including seven rubber estates.4 \n \n11.  When  the  subdecree  was  issued,  an  overall  review  was  planned  on  the  detailed \nfunctions of departments, but has not happened. As a result, there are still gaps and overlaps \namong MAFF's departments. Their roles and responsibilities need to be revised based on this \noverall  review,  which  will  be  undertaken  during  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program \n(ASDP).  MAFF's  staff  members  in  provinces  belong  to  provincial  departments  of  agriculture, \nforestry  and  fisheries.  Public  extension  services  for  farmers  are  primarily  provided  by  district \nextension staff. At central and local levels, an effective planning system is urgently required to \nintegrate externally and nationally funded programs and activities within a sector strategy. The \nplanned  projects  and  programs  need  to  be  consolidated,  budgeted,  and  prioritized  in  such  a \nframework. \n \n12.  MAFF's  central  budget  for  recurrent  expenditures  amounted  to  about  KR20  billion  or \nabout  $5  million  in  2001,  of  which  about  18%  was  allocated  to  staff  salaries;  67%  for  general \nadministration, materials, and  maintenance;  and  the  remaining  15%  for  operational expenses. \nThis  structure  of  expenditures  has  not  changed  since  then.  MAFF's  budget  for  recurrent \nprovincial expenditures is estimated at about 70% of the central budget. MAFF's operations are \nalmost  totally  dependent  on  external  funds  obtained  through  programs  financed  by  external \nfunding  agencies.  Disbursement  of  funds  for  MAFF's  field  operations  and  staff  salaries  is \nreportedly slow and erratic. There are often significant delays in release of funds, which affects \nimplementation of programs where seasonality of agricultural activities requires a quick flow of \nfunds  to  avoid  loss  of  a  full  year  in  programs.  This  delay  in  fund  flow  often  disrupts  linkages \nbetween  planning  and  field  operations.  According  to  the  technical  assistance  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  to  formulate  ASDP,5  the  MAFF's  Agriculture  Development  Support  for  the \nSeila Project financed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development provides a useful \nmodel for annual planning and fund disbursements, which has been formulated in line with the \nGovernment's decentralization policy. This model will be considered for adoption in the project \ncomponent of ASDP in view of MAFF's experience and skills accumulated in financial planning \nand management. However, consulting services will still need to be engaged under the project \nloan to provide assistance in the day-to-day project management. \n \n \n \n13. \nThe Council for Agricultural and Rural Development, chaired by the prime minister and \nrepresented  by  all  ministries  related  to  agriculture  and  rural  development,  is  the  highest \ngovernment  authority  for  interministerial  coordination  for  issues  related  to  the  policies  and \nstrategies  for  the  agriculture  sector.  The  line  agencies  are  required  to  regularly  submit  the \nprogress  reports  on  their  operations  to  the  council.  Its  secretariat  has  about  20  staff.  The \nprovincial  rural  development  committee  is  responsible  for  field-level  coordination  among  line \nministries  and  departments.  This  function  will  be  shifted  to  districts  and  communes  as \ndecentralization progresses. \n\nInter-ministerial Coordination in the Agriculture Sector \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n4  A more detailed assessment of agricultural institutions, including MAFF, is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n5   ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Agriculture Sector Development \n\nProgram . Manila. (TA 3695- CAM). \n\n\fAppendix 1     33 \n\n3. \n\nPublic Economic Enterprises in the Agriculture Sector \n\n \n \n \n14. \nIn  1998  the  Government  approved  a  divestment  plan  for  the  seven  SOREs  and \nsubsequently  established  seven  autonomous  public  enterprises  as  an  initial  step.  This  plan \nproposed  several  steps,  including  (i)  establishment  of  public  enterprises  outside  MAFF,  (ii) \nreconstruction  and  consolidation  to  establish  the  enterprises  as  viable  economic  entities,  and \n(iii)  sale  of  public  shares.  Alternatives  included  conversion  of  estates  into  smallholdings,  and \ndissolution. Divestment is expected to be completed by 2006. The Government, through MAFF's \nGeneral  Directorate  for  Rubber  Plantations,  initiated  some  steps  to  improve  the  estates' \noperations  by  separating  some  workers  and  staff  but  could  not  pursue  this  process  due  to \ngeneral resistance among administrative and managerial staff, and lack of funds. Some estate \nstaff have been separated since 1998, mostly absorbed by the public sector. Most field workers \nof the estates are contracted for rubber tapping and transportation.6 To effectively implement the \ndivestment  process  of  the  SOREs,  the  1998  divestment  plan  needs  to  be  updated  based on \nreliable  information  gathered  from  external  auditing,  and  pension  issues  of  staff  resolved \nthrough a participatory process during ASDP. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  initiated  divestment  of  the  Agricultural  Inputs  Company  (AIC)  in 1999 \nby converting it into an autonomous public enterprise. This process aimed to remove constraints \nand  uncertainty  in  the  market  for  agricultural  inputs,  including  agrochemicals  and  agricultural \nmachinery.  At  present,  AIC's  assets  include  cash  of  about  KR8  billion  or  $2.1  million,  four \nwarehouses and transport vehicles. Registration of AIC as a commercial company and approval \nof its statute by the board of directors were delayed for more than two years due to the delayed \nsettlement  of  counterpart  funds  from  AIC's  sale  of  stocks  of  past  grant  aid,  and  other \nadministrative issues. AIC sold about 7,000 t of urea in 2000, but has not been engaged in any \nbusiness  activity  since  it  became  an  autonomous  enterprise  despite  business  plans,  which \nincluded  proposals  to  trade  10,000  t  of  urea  and  5,000  t  of  diammonium  phosphate  in  2001. \nAnnual  administrative  and  salary  costs  of  about  KR400  million  ($100,000)  were  more  than \ncovered by interest received on AIC's cash assets.7 AIC's operations continue to be hampered \nby government procedures and AIC's own inflexible decision making. \n \nKAMFIMEX  was  established  in  the  late  1980s  to  handle  fish  exports,  which  it \n16. \nmonopolized until 1989. With liberalization of fish exports, KAMFIMEX now acts as an agent for \nsmall  fish  traders,  allowing  them  to  export  live  fish  and  fish  products  under  the  KAMFIMEX \nlicense,  charging  a  fee  to  cover  customs  duties  and  service  charges.  MAFF's  Department  of \nFisheries  also  granted  KAMFIMEX  a  fishing  lot  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  to  compensate \nKAMFIMEX  for  loss  of  income  from  export  and  transport  services,  and  secure  its  viability \nthrough catches. It is reported that fishermen associated with the KAMFIMEX's fishing lots are \nrequired  to  sell  their  catches  through  KAMFIMEX.  MAFF  will  need  to  consider  options  for \ndivestment of KAMFIMEX based on an accurate assessment of its assets and liabilities based \non the findings of external auditing. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  The  largest  estate  (Chup)  has  18  villages,  totaling  about  4,500  tappers.  Each  worker  receives  about  $1  per  day \n\nplus 24 kilograms of rice per m onth. \n\n7   Interest  rates  earned  on  this  fund  began  at  12%  in  2001,  when  interest  earned  amounted  to  KR1.0  billion,  as \nagainst  KR8.9  million  in  cash  deposits  (from  the  sale  of  stocks  and  leasing  of  trucks),  but  this  substantially \ndecreased in 2002 as interes t rates had fallen to 5%. Before 2001 interest on AIC\u2019s cash assets were credited to \nthe Government. This was changed after lengthy negotiations between AIC and the Government. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nVision for Agriculture in Cambodia \n\nD. \n \n17. \nCambodia is now self-sufficient in rice and is constantly exporting rice surplus. Increased \nrice  production  has  helped  improve  food  security  and  set  the  basis  for  agricultural \ncommercialization  and  diversification,  which  constitute  the  main  strategic  thrust  of  the \nGovernment's Second Socioeconomic Development Plan. However, the achievements are still \nfragile because agriculture largely depends on rainfall. Weak water control and lack of improved \ntechnology make smallholders vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather. Yet, the country is at a \ncrucial  moment,  when  strategic  decisions  need  to  be  made  in  relation  to  the  future  vision  of \nagriculture in the medium- to long-term. In this vision, rice will continue to be the main crop in \nterms  of  cultivated  areas,  but  the  importance  of  rice  in  terms  of  value  added  within  the  sector \nwill  decline.  The  share  of  higher  value-added  products  such  as  non-rice crops, fisheries, and \nlivestock  has  a  potential  to  increase  as  a  result  of  closer  integration  with  domestic  and \ninternational markets. Agricultural products may become a driving force for sustainable growth \nand allow Cambodia to benefit from its membership in the World Trade Organization. This vision \nwill clearly require concerted efforts to facilitate commercialization of agriculture, diversification \ntoward higher-value products, and integration of smallholders with agro-based enterprises. \n \n18. \nTo achieve this vision for the agriculture sector, the Government will continue the policy \nand  institutional  reforms  initiated  under  the  first  Agriculture  Sector  Program  (1996\u20132000) and \naddress  remaining  sector  issues  to  (i)  improve  ability  of  smallholders  to  raise  productivity  and \ndiversify towards higher-value products, (ii) improve market environment for private agro-based \nenterprise  growth,  and  (iii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  competitive  agricultural \ncommercialization.

E. Mr.  Tadao  Chino\nPresident\nAsian  Development  Bank\nMetro  Manila\nThe  Philippines\n\nYour \n\nExcellency,\n\nSubject\n\nDevelopment  Policy  Letter  for  Cambodia  Agriculture  Sector\nDevelopment  Program\n\n1. \nThe  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  (RGC)  hereby  requests  for  a  Special  Funds\nloan  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development\nProgram  (ASap).  Asap  has  been  formulated  through  extensive  dialogue  between  ADB  and\nin the  agriculture  sector.  and  reflects\nRGC.  and  through  consultations  with  key  stakeholders \ncritical  needs  of  the  sector. \nto  the\nmarket-ba:sed  agriculture  sector  development  and  aims  at  promoting  the  sector's  sustainable\ngrowth,  thereby  contributing  to  the  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in Cambodia.\n\nthe  Asap,  RGC  is  firmly  committed \n\nIn  implementing \n\n2. \nDuring  the  five-year  period  of  the  First  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (1996-\n2000),  the  domestic  political  and  regional  financial  crises  combined  with  the  severe  floods  of\n2000  resulted  in a  reduction  in the  rate of overall  economic  growth  to about  6.7%  per  annum.\nAlthough  Cambodia  achieved \nthe  growth  of  the\nrice  self-sufficiency  during \nagriculture  sector  was  minimal  at  3%  per  annum,  which  was  less  than  the  rate  of  population\ngrowth  and \nis\nwidespread \nin  the  country  with  about  36%  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line,  and  is\nin  rural  areas.  The  sustainable  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector  is  essential  for\nconcentrated \nthe  improvement  of peoples'  livelihoods  in Cambodia  where  the  sector  accounts  for  33.2%  of\nthe  gross  domestic  product  and  about  70%  of  the  total  population  directly  depends  on\nagriculture  for  their  livelihoods.\n\nfor  an  agrarian  society \n\nlike  Cambodia.  Poverty \n\nrather  disappointing \n\nthe  period, \n\nto  this  process  by  facilitating \n\nthe  transition  of  the  agriculture  sector \n\n3. \nImportant  institutional  and  policy  reforms  were  introduced  into  the  agriculture  sector\nduring  the  second  half  of  the  1990s.  The  ADB's  first  Agriculture  Sector  Program  significantly\ncontributed \nfrom  a\ncentrally  planned  system  to  a  sector  based  on  individual  initiatives  and  market  principles.\nCambodia  is currently  at  a  critical  stage  when  the  country's  vision  and  strategic  decisions  for\nthe  agriculture  sector  in  the  medium  to  long  term  have  to  be  materialized. \nIn this  vision,  rice\nwill  continue  to  be  the  main  crop  as  people's  staple  food  and  in terms  of cultivated  area.  Rice\nproduction  needs  to  be  improved  with  higher  productivity,  better  irrigation  systems,  and\nlinkages  with  modern  milling  facilities  and  export  markets.  However,  the  share  of  higher-\nvalue-added  products  such  as  non-rice  crops,  fish  and  livestock  in  the  agriculture  sector  is\nexpected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  closer  integration  with  urban  and  international  markets.\ninto\nBased  on  improved \n\ntechnology,  agricultural  diversification \n\ninputs  and  new  agricultural \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 4\n\nhigher-value  products  and \nfacilitated.\n\nforward \n\nlinkages  with  agro-based  enterprises  need \n\nto  be\n\n4. \nIn July  2002,  RGC  launched  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII:\n2001-2005)  with  assistance  from  external  funding  agencies,  including  ADB.  Under  SEDPII,\nRGC  wishes  to  transform  agriculture  into  a driving  force  to  achieve  higher  economic  growth\nand  reduce  the  incidence  of  rural  poverty.  To  achieve  this  sector  objective,  RGC  intends  to\naccelerate  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification  by  (i)  enhancing  a  liberal  and\ntrade  environment;  (ii)  deregulating  the  exportation  of  agricultural  and  agro-\nmarket-oriented \nbased \nimproving\n(iii)  developing  agricultural  quality  standards  and \nfacilities  for  postharvest  handling,  storage,  and  processing;  and  (iv)  establishing  appropriate\nfor  efficient  and  cost-effective  market\ncommercial \ntransactions  in the  agriculture  sector.  During  SEDPII,  RGC  intends  to  provide  increased  fund\nallocation  to  the  agriculture  sector,  amounting  to  about  12%  of  the  total  public  expenditures.\nASDP  will  provide  a timely  support  for  agriculture  development  in  line  with  SEDPII.\n\ninstitutional  arrangements \n\nindustrial  products; \n\nlaws  and \n\nfarmers'  ability \n\nUnder  ASDP,  RGC  will  focus  its efforts  on three  medium-term  policy  objectives: \nto  raise  productivity  and  diversifying \n\n(i)\n5. \ntowards  higher-value\nimproving \nfor  private  agro-based  enterprise  growth;  and\nproducts;  (ii)  improving  market  environment \n(iii)  strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity  for  competitive  agricultural  commercialization.  The\nspecific  reform  measures  proposed  under  ASDP  are  summarized  below  and  included  in the\nPolicy  Matrix  attached  to this  letter.\n\nproducts \n\nhigher-value \n\nand  diversifying\n\nFirst,  RGC  will  improve \n\nfarmer's  abIlity \nby  providing \n\nIn  raising  productivity \nthem  with  better  access \n\n6. \nto  productive\ntowards \nresources  such  as  land  and  water,  improved  seeds,  and  quality  inputs  in  the  agriculture\nsector.  The  revised  Land  Law  was  formulated  with  assistance \nfrom  ADB,  and  enacted  in\nAugust  2001.  However,  RGC  still  requires  a  wide  range  of  support  to  put  this  into  effect  so\nthat  Cambodian  people  will  actually  benefit  from  the  Law  in  having  good  access  to available\nland  and  securing  individual  land  rights.  Under  ASDP,  RGC  will  facilitate  the  implementation\nof  the  revised  Land  Law  by  initiating  the  transfer  of  private  state  land  for  social  purposes  to\nthe  landless  poor  and  ensuring  farmers'  secure  rights  to  their  land,  thereby  increasing  their\nincentives  and  ability  to  raise  productivity \nthrough  better  farming  and  land  management.\nRGC  will  formulate  a  sub-decr7e  for  the  reduction  of  economic  land  concessions  through  an\nihter-ministeria/  working  group  established  under  the  Council  for  Land  Policy.  RGC  has\nsubmitted  the  draft  Water  Law  to  the  National  Assembly  for  approval,  and  formulated  a draft\nNational  Water  Policy \nlegal  and  administrative\nin  line  with  the  draft  Water  Law.  This \nframework,  once  put  in  place,  will  ensure  better  planning  and  management  of  water\nin\nresources.  In parallel,  RGC  will  promote  the  formation  of farmers'  water  user  communities \nthe  priority  irrigation  schemes  during  the  ASDP  period.\n\nDespite  the  growing  production  of  high-value  crops,  farmers'  access  to  improved\n7. \nlegal  and  institutional\nseeds  still  remains  very  limited.  RGC  considers  that  an  appropriate \nframework  for  the  seed  sector  needs  to  be  established  to  increase  the  delivery  of  certified\nqualIty  seeds  to  farmers.  During  the  ASDP  period.  RGC  intends  to  finalize  the  draft  Seed\nLaw  for  this  purpose.  RGC  will  also  improve  the  regulatory  system  to  ensure  the  quality  of\nagro-chemicals \nin  the  market  by  providing  training  for  provincial  staff  and  private\ntraders,  and  strengthening \n\nthe  quality  inspection  system  in the  country.\n\ntraded \n\ngrowth \n\nSecondly,  RGC  will \n\nimprove  market  environment \n\n8. \nenterprl.8 \nto  promote  private  investment  in  the  agriculture  sector.  RGC  has  been\nmaking  efforts  to  modernize  the  Cambodia's  rubber  industry,  which  has  been  dominated  by\nthe  state.owned  rubber  estates.  With  assistance  from  ADB,  RGC  initiated  the  divestment  of\nrubber  estates  in  March  1999  by  converting  them  into  autonomous  public\nthe  state-owned \nfrom  the\nenterprises.  RGC  has  also  been  promoting  rubber  smallholders  with  financing \n\nfor  private \n\nagro-based\n\n\fAppendix \n\n4\n\n41\n\nincluding  smallholders' \n\nGovernment  of  France.  However,  the  estates'  inefficient  management  and  weak  marketing\nmechanism  still  result  in the  Jack of  international  recognition  and  lower  prices  of  Cambodian\nrubber  products.  RGC  wishes  to  further  advance  the  divestment  process  of  the  state-owned\nrubber  estates  and  complete  the  process  during  the  ASDP  period.  This  will  benefit  the  whole\nrubber  sector, \nrubber  production  and  marketing,  and  result  in  an\nin  the  sector's  overall  value-added.  During  the  last  few  years,  RGC  has  also\nincrease \nin  the  agriculture  sector  by\ninitiated  its  divestment  plans  for  other  state-owned  enterprises \nmaking  them  financially  autonomous.  However,  the  two  enterprises  (the  Agricultural \nInputs\nImport  and  Export  Company)  have  not  been\nCompany  and \nsuccessfully  adapted  to  market  conditions,  generate  uncertainty  in the  agricultural \ninput  and\noutput  markets,  and  use  scarce  public  resources  for  redundant  activities. \nIn  this  context,\nthese  enterprises  under  ASDP.

The rural economy has traditionally been \nconstrained by cyclic and chronic problems leading to increased poverty. Low agricultural value-\nadded  growth  implies  low  income  for  farmers,  who  make  up  most  of  rural  population.  Low \ngrowth  and  uncertainty  also  imply  reduced  incentives  to  invest  in  the  sector,  thus  weakening \nlinkages with the rest of the rural economy and compromising the sector's future sustainability. \nIn December 2002 the Government formulated the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) \nin  line  with  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII),  and  emphasized  the \nimportance of the agriculture sector in maximizing food self-sufficiency and increasing income-\ngenerating  opportunities.  In  the  agriculture  sector,  the  Government  will  implement  pro-poor \nstrategies to target provinces with high incidence of poverty and food insecurity. \n \nThe  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP)  will  facilitate  policy  reforms  in \n2. \nthree  areas:  (i)  improve  farmers  ability  to  raise  productivity  and  diversify  toward  high-value \nproducts,  (ii)  improve  the  market  environment  for  private  agro-based  enterprises,  and  (iii) \nstrengthen  institutional  capacity  for  competitive  agricultural  commercialization.  All  these \nmeasures  will  have  some  direct  or  indirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  The  first  policy  area \naddresses  improvement  of  legal  and  regulatory  aspects  of  productive  resources  and  input \nsupply, access, and use, with emphasis on poor and low-income farmers. By improving access \nto and use of non-rice land, smallholder investment can be encouraged through secure tenure. \nFarm production may be increased through improved  access to and use of irrigation water and \nquality  seed,  fertilizer  and  chemicals  in  input  markets.  The  poor  are  expected  to  be  major \nbeneficiaries  in  the  short  to  medium  term  particularly  of  measures  related  to  land  tenure  and \nlinkage  opportunities.  The  poor  will  also  benefit  from  quality  agricultural  inputs,  provided  they \nare affordable. \n \n3. \nSecond, divestment of public enterprises will remove distortionary effects of agricultural \ninput and output markets and enhance more com petitive market environment. Rubber is one of \nthe largest agricultural exports but state domination of the industry and inefficiencies constrain \nthe  subsector\u2019s  income-earning  and  growth  potential,  and  discourage  estate  and  smallholder \nexpansion. Smallholders, including the poor, will benefit from an improved market environment \nthat  will  facilitate  private  agroenterprise  growth.  However,  this  policy  area  may  result  in  a \npossible short-run reduction in public sector employment during divestment and have possible \nadverse  impact  on  low-income  estate  workers.  Any  negative  impact  needs  to  be  mitigated \nthrough  support  for  redeployment  and  provision  of  opportunities  for  smallholder  plantation \nownership and operation.2 The divestment of other enterprises, the Agricultural Inputs Company \n(AIC) and the Kampuchea Fish Import and Export Company (KAMFIMEX) will have no adverse \nimpact on the poor, but needs to include appropriate social safeguards satisfactory to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  third  policy  area  of  ASDP  will  require  shifting  of  public  sector  roles  and \n4. \nresponsibilities to encourage commercial agriculture at the national and local levels. The policy \n\n                                                 \n1  This  section  summarizes  the  poverty  impact  assessment  conducted  on  ASDP.  The  full  assessment  is  in \n\n2  Agricultural  Development  Services.  1999.  The  Divestment  of  Rubber  Plantations:  Social  Impact  Assessment. \n\nSupplementary Appendix F. \n\nSingapore. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n59 \n\nGender \n\narea  will  indirectly  impact  the  poor  through  several  channels  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  by \nimproving  access  to  and  relevance  of  agricultural  support  services  (extension,  research,  and \nagro-industries) in the decentralized system, and clarifying the national roles of the Ministry of \nAgriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  to  focus  on  improved  gender-sensitive  policy \nformulation. Improvement in MAFF policy planning will result in implementation of policies that \nmore  effectively  facilitate  agricultural  commercialization  in  domestic  and  export  markets  in  a \nfree-trade  environment.  Decentralization  of  agricultural  support  service  functions  to  the  local \nlevel will improve service provision, relevance, and overall access to poor farmers. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nWomen are generally disadvantaged in accessing  essential services and resources to \novercome  poverty,  particularly  in  education  (women's  literacy  rate  is  61%,  considerably  lower \nthan men's 83%). Rural women have a higher risk of ill health and bear a substantial burden in \nagricultural  production  in  addition  to  household  duties.  Women  constitute  more  than  half  the \nfarming  population  and  carry  out  most  of  the  rice  transplanting  and  harvesting.  They  are  also \nresponsible  for  seed  selection,  and  milling  and  pounding  for  household  consumption.  Women \nwork an average of 25- 45% longer than men each day. Women often tend vegetable gardens \nfor home consumption and for sale. Men are normally responsible for the care of large livestock, \nand women for small livestock. The gender division of labor is not entirely rigid  but men expect \nto be paid more for remunerative activities than women because of claimed physical strength. \n \n6. \nWomen  carry  out  well  over  90%  of  reproductive  and  household  duties,  including  the \ncaring for not only the very young and the aged but also, in some cases, adults who are ill or \ndisabled.  Social  obligations  are  important  and  time  consuming.  Women  do  not  get  public \nrecognition for their supportive role, especially in preparing food for the numerous cultural and \nreligious rituals. Women also provide much of the community work, such as ensuring the daily \nfeeding  of  monks  or  the  logistics  to  organize  a  major  temple  festival.  Women  and  men  have \nequal rights to legally own land. However, distress sales of land (due to loan default and other \nhardships) among poor female-headed households have been over double that of male-headed \nhouseholds.  Access  to  affordable  credit  and  other  income-generating  opportunities,  including \nwage  labor,  is  limited.  Participation  of  women  in  the  political and public sectors remains low \nfrom the commune to national level. Female extension workers are less than one third of total \nstaff complement. The situation is even worse at the MAFF central office, while slightly better in \nprovincial  departments  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries.  Female  students  are  under- \nrepresented in all institutions that offer tertiary education in agriculture.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nBased on a socioeconomic asses sment, 4 provinces in the southern region have been \nidentified  as  the  project  area  for  ASDP's  project  component  in  view  of  their  production  and \nmarketing  potential  of  high-value  products,  and  synergy  with  other  projects  in  the  agriculture \nsector. The project provinces are Kampong Cham, Kampong Speu, Kampot, and Takeo, with a \npopulation of about 3.5 million or 31% of the country's population. Land area ranges from 9,420 \nsquare kilometers (km2) in Kampong Cham to 3,490 km2 in Takeo. On average, more than 89% \nof labor force in these provinces is engaged in agriculture. Life expectancy at birth varies but is \nmostly in the late 50s. Kampong Speu has the highest total fertility rate of 6, and highest infant \nand child mortality rates of 80 and 53, respectively. \n \n8. \nThere are pockets of serious poverty, especially in Kampong Cham. These poor areas \nare  particularly  vulnerable  to  floods  and  other  natural  disasters.  In  the  project  provinces,  the \n\nSocioeconomic Profile of the Project Area \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nmajority  of  communes  are  poor,  with  20- 40%  of  households  being  below  the  official  poverty \nline.3  More  than  90%  of  households  have  some  type  of  land.  Survey  findings  (footnote  4) \nsuggest that 74% of male-headed and 62% of female-headed households have wet-season rice \nland,  while  61%  of  male-headed  households  and  62%  of  female-headed  households  have \nhome-garden  plots  for  non-rice  crops.  Only  2%  of  male-headed  and  none  of  female-headed \nhouseholds  have  a  legal  title  for  their  agricultural  or  residential  land.  Landless  households \nconstitute about 5% of total households surveyed.4 Landlessness is concentrated in the poorest \ngroup  of  farmers.  Large  tracts  of  land  concessions  exist  in  Kampong  Speu,  Kampong  Cham, \nand Kampot provinces, and limit access of landless and marginal farmers to productive land.  \n \n9. \nLand-use  patterns  have  changed  rapidly  with  the  increase  in  commercial  activities.  A \ndual system of land ownership and control is emerging. Obtaining a land certificate is complex \nand  lengthy,  involving  several  layers  of  government  offices.  There  is  a  tendency  that  more \npowerful  and  influential  parties  obtain  land  from  weaker  and  vulnerable  groups  of  people  by \ntaking  advantage  of  their  influence  in  their  society.  Forced  sale  or  land-grabbing is observed \noccasionally. The lack of awareness of the content and benefits of the 2001 Land Law, and lack \nof resources and knowledge disadvantage the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n10. \nDue to population pressure, migration from lowland to upland has become increasingly \nvisible  in  recent  years.  In  some  cases,  the  landless  or  near-landless  people  provided  with \nprivate  state  land5  from  local  authorities  clear  it,  resell  it,  and  migrate  again.  Similarly, \nencroachment  is  reported  in  various  economic  concessions.  In  the  project  provinces,  in-\nmigration rates are lower than those in provinces around the Tonle Sap Lake. According to the \nsurvey  (footnote  4),  the  majority  of  out-migrants  from  rural  areas  move  to  other  rural  areas. \nRural-to-urban out-migration is relatively low. \n \n11. \nIn  the  four  provinces  of  ASDP,  the  mainly  Muslim  Cham  people  are  the  major  ethnic \nminority group, constituting about 5% of the total population. They are lowland farmers having \nthe same life style as the dominant Khmer people. Their Islamic religious beliefs may limit the \nparticipation of women in social organizations. Other ethnic minority groups include Vietnamese, \nChinese,  and  Suoy  (mainly  in  Kampong  Speu).  The  accurate  number  of  these  people  is  not \nknown  because,  especially  in  the  case  of  Vietnamese,  some  are  illegal  migrants  belonging  to \nthe fishing community and also because they are often not permanently settled. It is estimated \nthat  they  constitute  less  than  1%  of  the  total  population  in  the  ASDP  provinces.  There  is  no \nadequate information on these ethnic groups, although the upland location of the Suoy people \nwould  suggest  an  involvement  in  shifting  or  swidden  cultivation.  It  is  also  likely  that  some  of \nthese groups, who have access to land in upland valleys, grow a wet season rice crop and non-\nrice crops such as vegetables, root crops, gourds and fruits for their consumption. \n \n12. \nAs in other parts of the country, there are people with disabilities in the project provinces \ndue to the past war and landmines. The 1999 Cambodia Socioeconomic Survey estimated that \nat  least  1.5%  of  rural  population  is  disabled.  Disabled  females  usually  suffer  from  congenital \ndisabilities,  including  visual  and  hearing  problems  than  males.  Landmines  will  also  have  a \nlingering impact on agricultural and other income-generating activities in the rural area.  \n \n                                                 \n3   Including monthly expenditure of KR 54,050 and other five criteria of (i) crop land per household, (ii) forest land per \n\nhousehold, (iii) female literacy, (iv) dependency ratio, and (v) access to safe drinking water.  \n\n4  Based on the field surveys conducted under a TA (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia \n\nfor Preparing the Agriculture Sector Development Program . Manila. [TA 3695- CAM]). \n\n5  Private  state  land  can  be  leased  or  traded  while  public  state  land  (like  land  for  roads and railways) is under a \n\nspecial legal regime and belongs to public legal entities. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n61 \n\nPossible Social Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n13. \nUnder  ASDP,  the  Government  will  facilitate  implementation  of  the  2001  Land  Law  by \nputting  in  place  the  subdecrees  on  social  land  concessions  and  on  reduction  of  unused \neconomic  land  concessions.  Selected  landless  people  will  be  settled  in  areas  to  be  made \navailable under the social land concession programs. ADB discussed possible social risks with \nthe  Government  and  agreed  to  include  in  the  subdecree  requirements  for  detailed  social  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  for  all  social  land  concession  programs.  These  measures \nwill  identify  possible  social  and  environmental  risks  involved  in  each  concession  program.  A \ndetailed  field  survey  will  be  first  carried  out  by  the  World  Bank  for  a  pilot  social  concession \nprogram  under  its  Land  Management  and  Administration  Project.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  the \nprogress and continue its dialogue during ASDP. \n \n14. \nLiquidation  of  unsustainable  public  enterprises  may  lead  to  short-term redundancies. \nThe Government has established a committee to manage divestment of the rubber estates, AIC, \nand KAMFIMEX, and address labor issues. There are about 15,500 employees in seven state-\nowned rubber estates. About 12,000 casual workers are engaged in rubber planting, production \nand  transport  activities  on  a  contract  basis.  Other  employees  include  managerial  and \nadministrative  staff,  teachers,  health  workers,  security  guards,  and  drivers.  Most  employees \nlikely to be affected will be among the less poor, including administrative and managerial staff \n(about  700).  Teachers  and  health  workers  are  expected  to  be  absorbed  in  the  relevant \nministries or provincial authorities. The Government formulated a plan for the divestment of the \nseven rubber estates in 1998. This plan needs to be updated and revised based on the external \naudit  of  the  estates  to  be  carried  out  by  the  national  divestment  committee.  A  resettlement \npolicy  framework  has  also  been  prepared  to  address  the  inadequacy  of  the  existing  legal \nprovisions  in  Cambodia.  This  policy  is  based  on  the  idea  that  ASDP  must  serve  the  needs  of \nsociety and ensure that the program affected people are at least as well-off due to divestment of \npublic enterprises. \n \n15. \nDivestment of AIC (55 staff) and KAMFIMEX (about 300 staff) will increase efficiency in \nthe use of scarce public resources, remove market uncertainties, and contribute to the growth of \nprivate agro-based enterprises, thereby creating more employment opportunities in the medium \nterm. During dialogue with ADB, the Government indicated its policy to absorb as many staff as \npossible  through  redeployment  within  MAFF.  However,  some  staff  members  need  to  be \nseparated  if  the  enterprises  are  to  be  liquidated.  The  Labor  Law  requires  the  employer  to \nprovide the employee with a specified minimum notice period before separation and a minimum \nseverance  benefit.  According  to  other  instances  of  divestment  in  Cambodia, actual terms and \nconditions  are  usually  determined  during  direct  negotiations  between  the  investor,  who  is \ninterested  in  purchasing  the  assets  of  the  concerned  public  enterprise,  and  the  Government, \nwhich  is  usually  represented  by  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  the  concerned  line \nministry.  In  relation  to  ASDP  reform  measures,  the  Government  assured  ADB  that  adequate \ncompensations  would  be  provided  for  the  employees  of  the  concerned  public  enterprises  in \ncase they are affected by the divestment plan of the Government. \n \nA few ethnic minority groups live in the project area for ASDP's project component. No \n16. \nadverse  social  impacts  on  them  are  foreseen.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  to  their \nfarming practices and social conditions when they intend to form farmer groups and participate \nin the project activities for agricultural extension support. Where necessary, minority groups may \nform their own groups and receive separate training. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \nB. \n \n\n \nC. \n \n\n \nD. \n \n\n \n\nTable A10: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nLinkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority \nin Country Poverty Analysis           YES \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reducing poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe  agriculture  sector  accounts  for  39%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  70%  of  the  total  labor  force,  and  has  a \nsignificant potential to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas, where about 90% of the country's poor live. The \nsector can also help increase farm household income, food security, rural employment and agro-based exports. \n\nSector  identified  as  National  Priority  in  Country  Poverty \nPartnership Agreement     YES \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nPoverty  is  widespread  in  the  country,  especially  in  rural  areas.  About  10%  of  farm  households  have  no  access  to \nagricultural  land,  and  farmers'  access  to  natural  resources  such  as  forest  and  fish  resources  is  limited.  Low  and \nhighly  variable  rural  incomes  set  the  stage  for  massive  internal  migration  in  the  country.  Increasing  disparities \nbetween  rural  and  urban  areas  cause  social  tensions  and  marginalization  of  rural  migrants  in  cities.  Increased \nproduction and marketing of high-value products is essential for sustainable agricultural growth. The current situation \nof  stagnant  agriculture  leads  to  persistence  of  poverty.  Lack  of  access  to  productive  resources  and  improved \nagricultural  inputs  and  technology  is  a  major  cause  of  low  productivity.  Especially,  poor  farmers  are  deprived  of \nincome-generating  opportunities,  physically  and  institutionally.  Large,  unhealthy  households  are  faced  with  serious \nobstacles  to  improving  their  livelihoods.  The  poor  have  low  levels  of  education,  and  lack  functional  skills  and \ninformation  on  markets.  The  poor  have  limited  access  to  commune  clinics,  health  centers,  and  modern  medical \nfacilities, and are also highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Locally-based intensive support is required to improve \nthe poor's livelihoods.  \n\nParticipation Process \n\nParticipation Strategy \nTo be formulated at project inception \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared  \nYES \nDuring preparation of the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP), stakeholder analysis and consultations \nwere  conducted  in  several  ways,  including  through  farmer  investm ent  surveys,  in  three  provinces  of  different \nagroecological  zones,  stakeholder  participatory  workshops  in  11  provinces,  and  focused  group  discussions  with  a \nwide range of stakeholders.  \n \nASDP  implementation  will  involve  participation  of  key  stakeholders  at  different  levels  and  from  different  sectors. \nMAFF and its provincial departments, and provincial departments of the Ministry of Women's and Veterans' Affairs, \nand other local administrations will take active part in the project component in line with the decentralization policy of \nthe Government. Private traders and nongovernment organizations will be involved in training programs, various field \ndays, and demonstration trials to be organized under ASDP. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Signifi-\ncant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \nNot \nsignificant \n\nResettlement \n\nStrategy to Address Issues  \n\nOutput Prepared \n\nThe  subdecree  for  social  land  concessions  was  finalized \nthrough  a  series  of  stakeholder  consultations  with  ADB\u2019s \ntechnical  assistance  to  Cambodia  for  Implementation  of \nLand  Legislation  (TA  3577- CAM).  A  pilot  social  land \nconcession  program  will  be  carried  out  under  the  World \nBank's  ongoing  Land  Management  and  Administration \nProject.  As  part  of  the pilot program, field assessments will \nto  ascertain \nin  some  selected  areas \nbe  conducted \n\nSocial and \nenvironmental \nimpact \nassessment \nrequirements \nincorporated in \nthe subdecree for \nsocial land \n\n\f \n\nStrategy to Address Issues  \n\nOutput Prepared \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n63 \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Signifi-\ncant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\nin  some  selected  areas \n\nincluding  downsizing  or  closure  of \n\nto  ascertain \nbe  conducted \nimplementation  issues  and  risks  and  ways  to  overcome \nthem  before  introducing  social  land  concessions  to  other \nareas.  ADB  will  continue  close  dialogue  with \nthe \nGovernment  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  social  land \nconcession program. \n \nWith  respect  to  divestment  of  state-owned  rubber  estates \nand  other  public  enterprises,  several  scenarios  can  be \nconsidered, \nthe \nenterprises.  There  is  a  possibility,  although  less  likely,  that \nthe  closure  or  downsizing  of  an  enterprise  may  lead  to \nestablishment of other activities displacing some workers of \nthe  enterprises.  To  address  this  issue,  the  Government  will \nensure that adequate social safeguards, satisfactory to ADB, \nwill be incorporated in ASDP. \nSupport \ninstitutionalization  of  gender \nmainstreaming  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  foreseen  under \nASDP.  No  negative  gender  issues  relating  to  ASDP \nimplementation are anticipated. Rather, a number of positive \nimpacts on women are highly likely. Women farmers will be \nempowered \nresources, \nservices, and opportunities.  \nNone \nDivestment  of  public  enterprises  may  result  in  some \nredundancies. External auditing will be carried out to obtain \nreliable  information  on  the  financial  positions  of  these \nenterprises and to update or formulate workable divestment \nplans, which will form the basis for detailed negotiations and \ntransparent  divestment  processes.

This section discusses the financial and economic benefits of \nASDP  expected  under  these  two  components.  A  narrative  assessment  has  been  done for the \nprogram  component  although  preliminary  estimates  are  also  indicated  for  the  adjustment  costs \nrequired for major policy and institutional reforms. With regard to the project component, financial \nand  economic  analyses  have  been  carried  out  quantitatively on the incremental cost and benefit \nstreams of the extension support for farmer groups. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  program  component  combines  efforts  to  liberalize  key  agricultural  markets,  and \nfocuses  on  institutional  reform  and  strengthening.  Institutional  reforms  are  a  medium-term \nprocess  given  the  time  required  to  establish  institutional  systems,  build  staff  capacity,  monitor \nagricultural  trades,  and  implement  regulations  nationwide,  and  to  realign  budgets  to  deliver \ndecentralized support services. \n \nThe  benefits  associated  with  improved  access  to  land  will  be  generated  from  increased \n3. \nsecurity of land property rights, which will provide incentives to poor and landless farmers to make \nunused  land  productive.  Several  farmers  are  already  living  on  the  land  envisaged  in  social  land \nconcession  programs  or  borders  of  economic  concession  lands.  This  is  in  fact,  one  of  the  main \nreasons for the failure of economic concessions that were given without considering the needs of \nlocal communities or landless people. The costs required for the reforms on land concessions will \ninclude  those  for  rural  development  support  for  the  beneficiaries  of  social  land  concessions  to \nsustain  their  livelihoods.  The  Government's  social  land  concession  programs  will  not  be \neffective  unless  accompanied  by  land  titling  and  agricultural  support  services  to  newly  titled \nsmallholders. The rural development support costs for the program will include those for land-\nuse surveys, titling, agricultural extension support and infrastructure. There will also be costs for \nincreased public awareness campaigns on the subdecree for social land concessions and the \n2001  Land  Law.  Compensation  payments  may  be  also  required  to  defray  investment costs of \nthe developers of unused and subsequently revoked economic concessions. \n \n4. \nThe expected benefits generated from divestment of state-owned rubber estates are of \ntwo  types.  The  first  relates  to  the  lower  cost  of  production  resulting  from  more  efficient \nenterprises and work force. The second type relates to additional investment in new assets and \nthe consequent increase in future revenues generated from higher profits from rubber or other \nproducts. Cost efficiency will be realized gradually one over the medium term. In the short run, \nthere  may  be  costs  required  to  provide  compensation  packages  for  some  redundant  staff.  To \neffect divestment of rubber estates, redundancy packages and provision of support services for \ndisplaced workers may be required, for which the program loan will generate counterpart funds. \n \nBenefits  expected  from  strengthening  of  agricultural  institutions  are  mostly  indirect  and \n5. \nto be generated from a more effective role of the public sector to facilitate the market-oriented \nagricultural  growth.  Rationalization  of  the  institutional  functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nForestry and Fisheries (MAFF) will require staff training to be provided under the project loan. In \naddition, the program loan will support the expanded role and geographic coverage of MAFF in \nregulating  quality  of  seeds,  fertilizers,  and  agrochemicals,  as  well  as  in  providing  market \ninformation services. \n\n\fAppendix 12     67 \n\n \n6. \nThe  Government  decided  to  introduce  a  medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) \nfor budget planning in priority sectors, including the agriculture sector.1 This will strengthen the \nlinkage between annual expenditures for the sector and overall development plans such as the \nSecond  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII)  and  the  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy.  In  view  of  the  importance  of  the  agriculture  sector,  the  allocation  of  public \nexpenditures  for  the  sector  needs  to  increase  rapidly  in  line  with  SEDPII. 2  The  overall  budget \nceiling for the agriculture sector needs to increase from about 2% to the range of 5\u201310%, which \nis the level adopted for other priority sectors. It is estimated that an incremental budget of about \n$20  million  will  be  required  for  the  agriculture  sector  in  the  medium  term.  During  ASDP \nimplementation, ADB will continue its dialogue with the Government for strengthening the MTEF \nfor  the  agriculture  sector,  and  promote  adequate  fiscal  allocations  to  facilitate  agricultural \ngrowth.  ASDP  will  also  improve  the  country's  fiscal  situation  through  potential  revenue \ncollections and increased efficiency in the agriculture sector. \n \n7. \nUnder the program component, ASDP will also contribute to benefit distribution in favor \nof  the  poor  through  (i)  increased  public  awareness  of  the  legal  framework  related  to  the  2001 \nLand  Law  and  related  subdecrees,  (ii)  progress  in  implementing  social  land  concession \nprograms  for  the  poor,  (iii)  divestment  of  state-owned  rubber  estates  and  other  public \nenterprises  that  will  benefit  rubber  smallholders  and  small-scale  enterprises  in  the  private \nsector,  and  (iv)  increased  fiscal  resources  to  local  administrations  to  deliver  public  agricultural \nextension services. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n8. \nFinancial and economic analyses were carried out for the project component of ASDP \nbased  on  typical  cropping  patterns  in  the  project  area,  and  expected  aggregate  costs  and \nbenefits.  It  is  assumed  that  the  project  benefits  are  expected  from  farmers'  adoption  of  new \ntechnology  through  extension  support  for  farmer  groups.  Other  benefits  indirectly  generated \nfrom  ASDP's  program  component  and  other  project  activities  relating  to  support  services  for \nagro-based  enterprises  and  institutional  capacity  building  will  significantly  enhance  project \nbenefits  but  have  not  been  quantified  in  the  analyses.  The  economic  life  of  the  project  is \nassumed to be 20 years. The prices of project inputs and outputs are those prevailing during the \nsurveys conducted in June 2002 in the project area.3 \n \n9. \nThe present Government policies in line with SEDPII are assumed to remain during the \nproject  period,  and  general  inflation  relating  to  project  inputs  and  outputs  will  not  have  a \nsubstantial  impact  on  relative  prices.  The  analysis  also  assumes  that  the  Government  will \neffectively  implement  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  under  ASDP  to  ensure  adequate \nbudgetary  allocations  for  public  extension  agents  to  achieve  project  objectives.  The  primary \ndata  and  information  for  the  analysis  were  collected  in  the  project  provinces  during  the  field \nsurveys, and recent data on farm-household production were available from various secondary \nsources related to the  ongoing  agriculture  projects.  These  data  have  been  used  to  construct \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

With-  and  without-project \nsituations  have  been  compared  based  on  these  farm  budgets  to  assess  the  incremental \nfinancial benefits and economic viability of improved practices arising from the proposed project \ninterventions.  The  analyses  assumed  that  about  70%  of  non-poor  farmers  and  about  60%  of \npoor  farmers  would  adopt  improved  technologies  and  practices  for  commercial  crops  offered \nunder the project. \n \n10. \nProject  activities  will  be  implemented  in  the  southern  region  of  Cambodia  where  there \nhas  been  a  significant  progress  in  rural  infrastructure  development4  and  private  market \ndevelopment.  Good  potential  exists  for  agricultural  commercialization  and  diversification,  with \nincreased  extension  support  for  farmer  groups  through  provision  of  information  on  new \nagricultural  technology,  markets,  and  enterprises.  The  total  number  of  potential  communes  for \nparticipation  in  the  project  is  512,  which  have  been  identified  to  avoid  overlapping  with  other \nongoing  project  activities.  Of  these  communes,  project  activities  can  be  implemented  in  about \n280  communes,  with  an  assumption  that  about  10  farmer  groups  from  each  commune  will \ndirectly  benefit  under  the  project.  The  cumulative  number  of  participating  farmer  groups  will \nreach 2,800 by project completion and about 56,000 farm households (20 farmers in a group) \nwill receive direct benefits under the project. \n \n\n2. \n\nCropping Patterns \n\n \n11. \nGradual  changes  in  cropping  patterns  are  expected  under  the  project  through  farmers' \nincreased adoption of new agricultural technology and commercial crops. In a few villages in the \nproject  provinces,  rapid  changes  have  been  achieved  by  nongovernment  organizations  and \nunder  the  Special  Programme  for  Food  Security  initiated  by  the  Government  with  assistance \nfrom the Food and Agriculture Organization. The project area is mostly in the rain-fed lowland \nregion  where  most  farmers  cultivate  rain-fed  paddy  during  May\u2013September.5 According to the \nfield survey conducted in the project provinces during preparation of ASDP, at least about 70% \nof  cropped  area  is  devoted  to  rice.  Non-rice  crops  include  corn  and  other  cereals,  various \nvegetables, beans, pulses, and fruits. \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  promote  more  efficient  and  commercially  viable  cropping  patterns  by \nincreasing access to improved inputs, and information on technology and marketing.  Both non-\npoor and poor farmers are expected to gradually change their cropping patterns and introduce \ncommercial  production.  Farmers  will  modify  commercial  cropping  patterns  more  frequently  in \nresponse  to  changes  in  local  market  conditions.  With  improved  access to extension services \nand market information, farmers and their groups will be able to make more informed decisions \nand  adopt  more  efficient  farming  practices.  Cropping  intensity  is  expected  to  increase  slightly \nbut remain almost stable in the medium term. \n \n\n3. \n\nCrop and Farm Budgets \n\n \n13. \nIndicative  crop  budgets  have  been  established  for  main  crops  cultivated  in  the  project \narea and based on farm-gate prices. Rice planting is mainly done through broadcasting in the \nproject  area.  Unpaid  family  labor  is  the  primary  source  of  unskilled  labor.  Hired  labor  is \nestimated to cost about KR3,900 ($1) per day. In some areas where transplanting is practiced, \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

Other cash expenses include those for hiring \ndraft animals and purchasing agrochemicals. \n \n14. \nCambodian farmers consider rice a highly important staple food and strongly emphasize \nsecure rice production. Farmers, particularly poor farmers with small  landholdings, are thus not \nexpected  to  reduce  their  cropped  area  for  wet-season  rice.  Under  the  project,  incremental \nfinancial  benefits  for  farmers  will  mainly  come  from  higher  margins  gained  from  improved \nproductivity and increased production of high-value crops. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Economic Costs and Benefits \n\n \n15. \nThe  indicative  economic  viability  of  the  project  has  been  assessed  in  aggregate  based \non  the  economic  prices  of  farm  inputs  and  outputs.  Border  prices  have  been  taken  from the \nWorld Bank's global market prices (constant 2002 prices), and a world price numeraire is used \nfor  the  analysis.  The  economic  prices  of  local  and  high-yielding  rice  varieties  have  been \nestimated at the border on an import- and export-parity bases as appropriate, and adjusted for \nnon-tradable  costs,  including  handling  and  transportation,  with  a  standard  conversion  factor  of \n0.9,  and  labor  contents  with  a  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.9.6  Project  cost  items  for  extension \nsupport for farmer groups, which are mostly non-tradable items, have also been adjusted with \nthe standard conversion factor. The economic internal rate of return for the project is 39% and \neconomic net present value at a 12% discount rate is KR40,234 million ($10.3 million). \n \n\n5. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \nA  standard  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  for  (i)  increased  costs,  (ii)  reduced \n16. \nbenefits, (iii) a combination of the two, and (iv) a 1-year lag in benefits.
