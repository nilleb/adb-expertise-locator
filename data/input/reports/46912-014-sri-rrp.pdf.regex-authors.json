I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nunsecured loan of $15,000,000 to DFCC Vardhana Bank (DVB) for the Housing Finance Project \nin Sri Lanka.1 \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  The finance sector in Sri Lanka has been constrained by a number of factors. The difficult \ninvestment climate, cumbersome procedures, and, in particular, the lack of access to adequate \nand timely financing has led to borrowing becoming more expensive and profit margins being \nreduced. Bank lending, however, has increased as a result of stabilization of the political situation \nand continued strengthening of the economy.  A gap in longer-term funding that would support \nthe growing needs of borrowers seeking housing loans and funding for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), for instance, remains. Moreover, there is a clear preference by banks to \nserve large, top-tier companies and higher-income customers that are perceived to have lower \nrisks,  which  serves  to  further  limit  access  to  finance.  This  proposal  aims  to  support  the \ndevelopment of the finance sector by addressing the scarcity of housing finance in Sri Lanka by \nproviding long-term funding and capacity building technical assistance (TA) to a mid-tier bank \ntargeting the underserved market. \n \n3.  Sri Lanka suffers from a housing shortage that is currently estimated at between 350,000 \nunits and 1 million units with an additional need of about 100,000 units per annum.2 There is also \na special need for new housing and rehabilitation of homes damaged by the civil war in the North \nand East, and South as a result of the 2004 tsunami. Demand for housing has steadily increased \nfollowing the end of the civil war, which has led to improved consumer sentiment, rising income \nlevels (16% in total since 2009),3 and repatriation of Sri Lankans.  \n \n4.  Against this backdrop of growing demand, however, is a scarcity of mortgage financing as \nreflected in a mortgage debt\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of 6%, which is considerably \nlower than the global average of about 30%. Although the Sri Lankan mortgage market grew at \nan annual rate of about 30% from 2004 to 2009, the World Bank estimates that 80% of the \npopulation does not have access to long-term financing needed to purchase homes (footnote 2). \nNot only is there a sheer lack of mortgage finance available, but also the small amount of \nmortgage finance that is provided is extended to just a few narrow customer segments, resulting \nin market fragmentation. The World Bank estimates that banks provide mortgages to only 20% of \nthe population and at the higher end of the housing market, while a small segment of the lower \nend of the market is being served by microfinance institutions and some state-owned banks \n(footnote  2).  Nearly  30%  of  the  market,  primarily  in  the  middle-  and  lower-middle-income \nsegments, are considered to be bankable clients but are not expected to be served in the near to \nmedium term by the current market. The Government of Sri Lanka expects the private sector to \nplay a larger role in the provision of housing finance and, with that, the government intends to \nshift away from primary mortgage provision. This will create further room for private commercial \nbanks to expand their operations to cater to the largely unmet demand for housing finance.4 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  T.

Colombo (June); and \n ", "2    \n5.  A well-functioning mortgage system with increased and diverse private commercial bank \nparticipation in terms of first- and second-tier banks is needed to provide access to mortgage \nfinance to these prospective borrowers and close the market gap. Greater private commercial \nbank  participation  is  expected  to  lead to  a more  competitive  mortgage finance market  with \nimproved affordability, efficiencies, and product diversification, and, importantly, more inclusive \ncustomer segmentation strategies. The involvement of more private sector commercial banks \nproviding higher volumes of mortgage lending (currently at only about 4% of total banking assets) \nis also important as the government cannot support the large needs of the housing market as it \nmoves toward a more efficient economy.5 \n \n6.  One of the primary impediments to the overall development of the mortgage market in Sri \nLanka has been the lack of access to longer-term financing for banks because of the country\u2019s \nlow level of finance sector development (FSD) (specifically its capital markets), the civil war, and \nthe global financial crisis. Due to the government\u2019s current account deficit and the need to bridge \nthe external funding gap, the government is encouraging overseas borrowings by Sri Lankan \nbanks for both senior and subordinated debt.6 Other issues that have constrained growth include \neviction difficulties, high land registration costs, the absence of an electronic title system, and lack \nof comprehensive market data.7 With respect to the middle- and lower-middle-income segments, \nadditional  issues  include  a  perception  of  heightened  risk  (as  many of  these  customers  are \nnonsalaried workers), an absence or underdevelopment of sophisticated and specialized credit \nanalysis  techniques  makes  it  difficult  for  banks  to  better  serve  these  markets,  and  lack  of \naffordability at the lower end of the market. \n \n7.  Given the need for long-term funding to increase private commercial bank participation in \nthe market and with the goal of encouraging banks to target underserved customer segments, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) met with several banks in 2011 to identify a suitable candidate \nwith the interest and ability to move down market. Additionally, ADB sought a bank that could \neffectively address the specific needs for housing in the North, East, and South.  DVB, a medium-\nsized bank and a participant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program,8 was selected as a partner bank \nfor the project for a number of reasons. First, DVB has an interest in addressing underserved \nsegments. Its current average mortgage loan size is approximately equivalent to $27,500, which \nis less than many of the larger banks. DVB is thus deploying a niche strategy by servicing an \nunderserved segment of the market. Moreover, DVB is willing to move further down market with \nthe use of ADB proceeds. Second, DVB\u2019s parent bank, the DFCC, is a well-known development \nbank with over 60 years of experience in the market. DVB benefits from this brand recognition, \nwhich  is  particularly  important  for  personal  loans  such  as  mortgages.  Third,  DVB  has  an \nextensive branch network of 127 branches, of which 105 are outside Colombo, including eight in \nthe North and East. Finally, although DVB is ranked eighth in the market in terms of assets \n($353.3 million as of 31 December 2011), its credit standing is close to or on par with some of the \nlarger commercial banks. Fitch Ratings Sri Lanka has given DVB a AA- rating, which is equivalent \nto ratings for Hatton Bank and Sampath Bank and only one notch lower than Commercial Bank of \nCeylon.9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) meetings with the Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in \nMay 2012. \n5  Shorebank International. 2012.

The project entails the provision of long-term funding of $15 million \nto  enable  DVB  to  provide  mortgages  to  borrowers  to  purchase  affordable  housing  and  to \nrehabilitate existing homes. The project has geographic targets to support rehabilitation in the \nNorth, East, and South. To strengthen the banking sector and enhance ADB\u2019s developmental \nimpact,  DVB  will  also  be  participating  in  ADB\u2019s  existing  TA  for  Housing  Finance  Capacity \nDevelopment in South and Southeast Asia to further strengthen its mortgage loan origination and \nservicing capacity.10 This will be the ADB Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s first housing \nfinance transaction in Sri Lanka. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n9.  DVB is a subsidiary of DFCC and a licensed commercial bank.11 A merger between DFCC \nand DVB in the long term is possible, but this may be dependent on future amendments to the \ncurrent Banking Act and CC being able to obtain a combined license/ commercial banking license \nwith strong development banking links.12 In addition to its large branch network, DVB has 200 \nautomatic teller machines13 and 750 staff. At end December 2011, DVB had a 1.3% market share \nof total banking loans, 1.2% in terms of deposits, and 1.0% of total assets.14 DVB's lending focus \nhas historically been the provision of working capital facilities to SMEs and corporate entities. \nDVB began providing housing loans in 2006; however, mortgage lending accelerated after the \nwar in 2009. DVB established the Personal Financial Services Unit in 2010, which offers personal \nloans for professionals, mortgages and construction,15 education loans, financing of imports, and \npurchase of motor vehicles. As of the end of 2011, DVB\u2019s portfolio was segmented as follows: \ncorporate banking 22%, business banking 17%, branch banking and SMEs 50%, and personal \nfinancial services (PFS) 11%. \n \n10.  With the establishment of the Personal Financial Services Unit, DVB has strategically \nshifted to a customer-centered approach to better respond to growing consumer demands and \nthe improving economy following the cessation of the civil war.16  By 2015, PFS is expected to \ncontribute to 33% of all bank advances. DVB has launched a number of standard asset and \nliability products, such as leasing loans, education loans, and junior plus savings and deposits. \nWith respect to its mortgage lending activities, to meet this target, DVB launched Vardhana \nSandella, its branded housing loan product targeted at borrowers from business and professional \nbackgrounds. DVB also benefits from its existing base of SME customers, as it is familiar with the \nmarket segment and can cross-sell its affordable home loan product to these potential borrowers. \nSecond,  DVB  recruited  an  experienced  PFS  head  who  has  23  years  of  consumer  loan \nexperience, including mortgage lending, from a leading bank in Sri Lanka. Third, DVB has further \nstrengthened the SME department, enabling experienced staff to provide branches with expertise \nin areas including mortgage lending, and guidance as needed.  A separate mortgage finance unit \nwill be created by the end of 2012. \n \n11.  The opening of the Northern and Eastern provinces is viewed by DVB as a  market \nopportunity, given the pent-up demand for financial services. DVB envisages an expanding role in \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and Southeast Asia. Manila \n(TA 7469-REG). \n11 The Central Bank of Sri Lanka issues banking licenses for two categories of banks: licensed commercial banks and \nlicensed specialized banks. The main difference is that licensed commercial banks are permitted to accept demand \ndeposits from the public and can act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange, which entitles them to engage in a \nwide-range of foreign exchange transactions.  Licensed specialized banks cannot do this. \n12 The merger is dependent on the legal implications of holding both a commercial bank and a specialized bank license. \n13 Includes other access points apart from own automatic teller machines. \n14 DVB Bank Market Study 2012. \n15 Construction relates to building of individual houses or renovation for individuals or families on a small scale. \n16 Per capita income has steadily increased, rising from $899 in 2000 to $2,400 in 2010.

By the end of 2012, DVB \nwill add eight branches, giving DVB 16 branches in the North and East and by far the largest \ndistribution network among the banks in Sri Lanka in the conflict-affected areas. Parallel to the \nphysical expansion, DVB increased the number of staff and management by 19% to a total of 750 \nemployees to strengthen core banking areas and to match the growth of business volumes. \nDVB\u2019s expanded geographical penetration and increased number of staff enables it to market its \nPFS products to individual customers in rural and semi-urban areas, where competitors are not \nnumerous. Eighty percent of DVB\u2019s PFS portfolio is from the outstations.17 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n12.  DVB, previously known as the National Mercantile Bank, was established as a licensed \ncommercial bank in 1996. DFCC acquired the National Mercantile Bank in 2003 when it was in \nneed  of  capital,  and  subsequently  restructured  and  renamed  it.  DFCC,  with  total  assets  of \nSLRs109.5 billion as of December 2011, is ranked fourth in the market as of 30 June 2011 in \nterms of total assets.18 DFCC currently holds a 99.1% stake in DVB.19 It obtained regulatory \napproval to increase its holding in DVB to 100% in April 2011. Major shareholders of DFCC are \nthe Bank of Ceylon Pension Fund (14.3%), the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (13%), the \nHatton National Bank (12%), M. Yaseen (8.6%),20 the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (6.4%), \nthe  Seafeld  International  (5.76%),  and  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  (4.8%).21 DVB  is  of \nstrategic importance to DFCC, accounting for 42% of DFCC\u2019s assets as of the end of December \n2011, and plays an important role in expanding the group\u2019s product offering. The two banks are \nviewed by DFCC as separate economic entities, but with integrated front- and most back-office \nfunctions. \n \n2.  Management \n13.  DVB\u2019s senior management consists of a team of banking executives with experience \nacross multiple banks in Sri Lanka and who are responsible for managing DVB in conformity with \nits stated goals. The key senior positions are (i) chief executive officer (CEO), (ii) chief operating \nofficer, (iii) executive vice-president of lending, (iv) senior vice-president of treasury, (v) head of \noperations, (vi) senior vice-president of integrated risk management, (vii) vice-president of credit \nrisk management and credit risk appraisal, and (viii) head of personal financial services. The \nCEO, L. Silva, has more than 25 years of experience in banking, credit, leasing, factoring, and \nbranch management.22  The bank has a number of management committees.  The Asset Liability \nCommittee (ALCO) analyzes DVB's operating condition and market risks, and devises strategies \nfor  managing  risks  and  meeting  funding  needs.  The  ALCO  reports  to  the  Integrated  Risk \nManagement Committee. \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n14.  DVB is managed through various levels of corporate governance, including the board of \ndirectors, several board committees to facilitate managing DVB's operations, and the internal and \nexternal audit function. The board of directors reports to the shareholders and is headed by its \n                                                \n17 DVB. 2012. DVB Annual Report. Colombo. \n18 Fitch. 2011.

Apart from the \nchair and CEO of DFCC, DVB, and DFCC have different board members. They come from \nvarious backgrounds and have diverse experience both locally and internationally. The board \napproves DVB's strategy, business plan, and corporate plan; reviews all of DVB's general policies \nand  principles;  and  is  involved  with  other  matters  relating  to  overall  bank  functioning  as \nappropriate.23   The  board  of  directors  has  appointed  four  subcommittees  to  assist  in  the \nperformance  of  its  duties\u2014the  Audit  Committee,  the  Human  Resource  and  Remuneration \nCommittee,  the  Integrated  Risk  Management  Committee,  and  the  Nomination  Committee. \nCompliance within DVB is supervised by the Audit Committee, which reports to the board.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n15.  DVB\u2019s  overall  financial  performance  is  strong.  Total  assets  increased  by  56%  from \nSLRs29.5 billion to SLRs45.9 billion from 2010 to 2011. As of the end of March 2012, total assets \nwere SLRs52.9 billion. Growth in net income was 92% from 2010 to 2011, which is strong given \nthe competitive interest rate environment and DVB\u2019s increased branch network costs.

Capital adequacy. DVB\u2019s capital position is strong at 17.2% of risk-weighted assets as of \nthe end of 2011. This is an improvement from 15.4% as of the end of 2010, which was due to \nfresh capital infusion of SLRs1.1 billion from the parent company by way of a rights issue and a \nfully subscribed SLRs1.0 billion subordinated debenture issue in 2011. \n \n17.  Asset quality. DVB\u2019s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, defined as 90 days and above past \ndue, was 4.3% as of the end of 2011, below the industry average of 4.5% and comparing \nfavorably to the NPL ratio of 7.2% reported at the end of 2010. Housing NPLs were low at only \n2% as of March 2012. The overall improvement of the quality of the credit portfolio reflects the \nbenefits of stable economic conditions and DVB\u2019s concerted actions to reduce NPLs by tightening \ncredit underwriting standards.  \n \n                                                \n23 Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides \ndetails regarding DVB\u2019s directors. \n ", "6    \n18.

After-tax  earnings  increased  by  92%  from  SLRs275.9  million  in  2010  to \nSLRs531.4 million in 2011 in line with the increase in DVB\u2019s lending portfolio, which grew from \nabout SLRs19 billion in 2010 to SLRs33 billion in 2011. The increase in net profit was driven by \ngrowth in fund- and fee-based income, cost efficiencies relating to operations, and reduced loan \nimpairment charges. Net income during the three months ending 31 March 2012 was SLRs150.7 \nmillion. \n \n19.  Liquidity. DVB has diversified sources of funds. During 2011, DVB was able to borrow \nshorter-term funds from commercial banks and raise capital from the market. DVB\u2019s loan\u2013deposit \nratio increased from 91% to 104% from 2010 to 2011as deposits grew more slowly than loans. \nThere were negative maturity gaps in the 3\u20136-month bucket due to deposit maturities, as more \ndepositors prefer a shorter investment horizon when there is an upward movement in the yield \ncurve, and in the above 5-year bucket due to the shortage of longer-term financing, which is \nrequired for some of the longer-term products such as mortgage loans. ADB\u2019s 10-year loan will \nhelp to reduce maturity mismatches for longer-term mortgage loans.24 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20. ADB proposes to provide a senior unsecured loan to DVB of $15 million with a tenor of 10 \nyears. DVB will be required to use the facility exclusively for mortgage onlending and housing \nrehabilitation loans. The ADB loan will be disbursed in two tranches to help DVB better manage \nits growth and to benefit from ADB\u2019s TA for Housing Finance Capacity Development in South and \nSoutheast Asia (footnote 10).The capacity development TA will focus on (i) improving credit \nassessment techniques with a particular emphasis on assessing self-employed or lower-middle-\nincome borrowers, which comprise part of the target market of the project; (ii) developing a more \ndetailed  scorecard  for  housing  loan  borrowers  and  portfolio  and  risk  management;  and  (iii) \ntraining. \n \n21.  Housing loan parameters for the ADB facility. ADB will restrict the use of its funds to \nonly owner-occupied residences to prevent speculative lending. Additionally, a geographic target \nwill be set at a minimum of 30% outside Colombo in the North, East, and tsunami-impacted \nareas. To ensure that DVB is providing loans for affordable housing, it will be expected to have an \naverage mortgage loan size of not more than $20,000 for the pool of mortgages originated from \nADB funds. This represents a reduction of about 25% from DVB\u2019s current average mortgage loan \nsize. Additionally, to ensure prudent growth of the portfolio, loan-to\u2013value ratios in excess of 80% \nwill not be allowed. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Reporting arrangements. DVB will be required to provide the following information: (i) \nunaudited quarterly financial statements; (ii) audited annual financial statements; (iii) quarterly \ncompliance  certificates  for  agreed-upon  financial  covenants;  (iv)  semiannual  reports  on  the \nmortgage portfolio, which will include data on loans extended to women; and (v) an annual \nenvironmental  and  social  performance  report,  including  a report  on  housing  loans taken  by \nwomen. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s Operations Manual governing, Nonsovereign Operations, monitoring \nreports will be prepared on a regular basis, but at least annually. 25 The first monitoring report will \nbe prepared no later than 12 months after approval by the ADB Board of Directors. \n                                                \n24 Most deposits are rolled over at the new interest rate. \n25 ADB. 2010. Nonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D10/BP. Manila. ", "  7 \n \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n23.  ADB will provide critically needed long-term funding to DVB, which DVB can in turn use to \noffer mortgages of longer tenor. Housing borrowers in Sri Lanka have been adversely impacted \nby the country\u2019s low level of FSD (especially in the North and East), including the absence of a \nwell-developed capital market, which limits the availability of longer-tenor funding. In addition, \nADB\u2019s involvement ensures that the loan will be used to target housing finance needs in areas \nimpacted by the civil war and tsunami. With the recovery and the return of the diaspora, longer-\ntenor funding is essential to build or rebuild houses that have been destroyed or damaged, and to \nsupport future growth. Moreover, women who have lost their spouses in the war will also have the \nopportunity to borrow and build secure housing and/or improve existing dwellings. DVB has \ncommitted  to  provide  5%  of  the  facility  to  women  borrowers.  Lastly,  the  ADB  capacity \ndevelopment TA will provide DVB with support to prudently expand and increase the efficiency \nand sustainability of services for mortgage lending. Increasing efficiencies is expected to enable \nDVB to improve affordability of mortgage loans.26 \n \nD.  Risks \n24.  Political and economic conditions. President Rajapaksa\u2019s coalition party has ruled for \ntwo consecutive terms since the end of the war. While the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nis not expected to reemerge as a major threat, isolated terrorist attacks may occur. In addition, \nalthough the economy has been strengthening since 2009, it has been affected by the global \ndownturn and high interest rates due to a lack of liquidity in the banking system.27 Adverse \nchanges in the political situation or a further economic downturn could negatively impact DVB\u2019s \noverall performance, as well as the demand for mortgage loans. However, Sri Lanka\u2019s overall \noutlook is positive and GDP is projected to expand by 7% annually (footnote 26) on average \nthrough 2016. \n \n25.  Regulatory issues pertaining to mortgage lending. The Sri Lankan title registration \nsystem and regulatory environment for mortgage lending could be strengthened to accelerate \nhousing ownership.  Regulatory issues have not constrained growth of DVB\u2019s housing finance \nbusiness.  Banks can foreclose on property, but eviction is culturally difficult.  In the north and \neast, there are titling issues in certain cities as a result of the civil conflict.  DVB will carefully \nassess titling and registration issues in these regions.  In many cases where clear titles are an \nissue, DVB can obtain title insurance. \n \n26.  Market competition. The housing finance market in Sri Lanka has become increasingly \ncompetitive since 2009, particularly in specific market segments. State-owned banks, helped by \nthe offering of subsidized lending to not only low-income borrowers but also middle-income \nborrowers, continue to dominate the housing finance market. However, DVB as well as other mid-\ntier banks are seeking to build their housing loan portfolios. While DVB currently operates in the \nupper middle- and middle-income market, DVB seeks to capitalize on its niche SME market \nknowledge and broad distribution network to expand into other income and geographic segments, \nnow largely underserved, which is expected to give it a strategic advantage. The government is \nalso not expected to be able to continue to provide large subsidies to state-owned banks on a \nlong-term basis, which should contribute to leveling the playing field.  \n \n                                                \n26 The World Bank estimates that operational efficiency gains can save borrowers 100\u2013300 basis points.

Country Report Sri Lanka. London (May). \n ", "8    \n27.  Portfolio growth, evolving risk management/underwriting capacity. DVB reported an \nNPL ratio of 4.3% in 2011, a decrease of 2.9% from 2010, coinciding with total loan growth of \n75% in 2011. DVB\u2019s mortgage loan portfolio has also performed well with an NPL ratio of 2% as \nof 31 March 2012. DVB has implemented a number of measures to improve credit underwriting \nand portfolio monitoring standards including the use of a risk rating tool, sector segmentation, and \nincreasing down payments when necessary. In the near term, the bank plans to further tailor its \ncredit scoring system for mortgage lending.  ADB\u2019s TA will help to further strengthen DVB\u2019s credit \nunderwriting and servicing standards to help the bank manage its expansion in this market \nsegment. Additionally, ADB\u2019s loan will be provided in two tranches to prudently manage loan \norigination. ADB will monitor asset quality via reporting from DVB on the bank and its mortgage \nportfolio.  \n \n28.  Future funding risk. Growth of DVB's mortgage business is dependent upon access to \nlong-term funding and deposit growth, which are constrained by the state of the capital markets \nand macroeconomic instability. Banks can access capital markets, but the tenor of bonds tends to \nbe shorter term. In the future, as the capital markets mature, banks may be able to issue longer-\nterm bonds. More immediately, longer-term funding can be obtained through other IFIs active in \nSri Lanka. DFCC has relationships with various IFls and has been successful in obtaining funding \nfrom them.  \n \n29.  Currency risk. DVB will borrow and repay in US dollars, although all mortgage loans will \nbe in Sri Lanka rupees. To mitigate this risk, DVB will hedge the ADB loan and the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka has offered swaps at preferred rates for all banks obtaining foreign funds. DVB is \ncompliant with the prudential open exposure limit of a daily maximum of $3 million. As of the end \nof December 2011, DVB had an open exposure of $2.6 million. As DVB\u2019s treasury operations are \nintegrated with DFCC, DFCC will help DVB to hedge open exposures. Currently, there are no \nviable currency swap options via ADB, and ADB does not have the ability to issue a local \ncurrency bond. Should this scenario change during the tenor of the loan, DVB will have the option \nto convert the loan on agreed terms with ADB. \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n30.  The project will directly contribute to private commercial banks, especially tier-two banks, \nhaving an increased share in the housing finance sector in Sri Lanka, which is important given \nthat state-owned banks have the dominant share of the market. Increasing the private sector\u2019s \nshare of the housing finance market from 36% to 46% by supporting the growth of mid-tier banks \nis expected to improve competition in the sector and lead to the development of competitive \npricing and better products and services. It is also expected to help address housing shortages, \ngiven that, as more mortgage financing becomes available for affordable housing, construction in \nthis segment typically grows.28 Other indirect development impacts of housing finance include an \nincreased contribution of the construction sector to overall economic growth and employment \ngeneration, particularly for unskilled or nonprofessional or technical workers, through its many \nbackward and forward linkages.29 The main outcome from the project is the successful expansion \nof DVB\u2019s housing finance program to an underserved segment, while ensuring a minimum 30% of \nthe amount equal to the ADB loan is provided as mortgage loans in the North, East, and South by \n                                                \n28 In many emerging market countries, housing shortages can be directly linked to a lack of housing finance.

In 2008, the industry comprised predominately \ncraftsmen (71%), followed by technical staff (12%), professionals (11%), and operators (6%). Source: A. Pathirage. \n2008. Sri Lanka Country Report. Paper for the 14th Asia Construct Conference. Tokyo.  23\u201324 October. ", "  9 \n2017. DVB will also commit to providing at least a 5% of the amount equal to the ADB loan to \nfemale mortgage borrowers  and at least 40% of the amount equal to the ADB loan to married \ncouples (jointly to husbands and wives) by the end of 2017.  The output includes DVB having \nincreased  housing  finance  from  DVB.  A  key  output  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  credit  risk \nassessment and servicing capabilities to better target more lower-income clients. The latter is a \nresult of the parallel CDTA approved in 2009 by ADB for capacity development for housing \nfinance, some resources from which will be specifically directed to DVB to enable it to improve \nthe quality of its growing housing portfolio. DVB will also commit to a target of training 50% of its \nfemale credit analysts with funding from the CDTA. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n31.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB will strengthen its support to the finance sector at the regional \nand national levels by helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and \nservices and by promoting inclusive growth.30 Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to assist \nin channeling the region's savings into the most productive investments, as well as continue to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The \ninvestment supports institutional and finance sector development through the deepening of the \nfinance sector by expanding mortgage lending in Sri Lanka to an underserved customer segment.  \n \n32.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  10-year  development  policy \nframework (DPF), 2007\u20132016, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016.31 The DPF \nwas revised in 2010, reflecting the change in the country\u2019s environment after the end of the war. It \naims to accelerate economic growth, increase access to finance, address low private sector \ninvestment,  improve  social  indicators,  eradicate  hard-core  poverty,  and  improve  the \nenvironment.32 The country partnership strategy is built on the DPF and Strategy 2020, which \nspecifies a focus of ADB assistance on private sector development and expanding the role of the \nprivate sector, including projects that support housing. The project supports both these objectives \nby  increasing  the  share  of  private  commercial financing  in the  housing finance market  and \nimproving bank capacity in this area through TA. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n33.  Supporting FSD is a key focus of development assistance for ADB, in line with the tenets \nof ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy (footnote 32) and enhanced poverty reduction \nstrategy.33 The latter states that ADB seeks to promote \u2015sound and efficient banking systems and \ncapital markets\u2016 since these are seen as \u2015indispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing \nsavings and ensuring availability of long term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor \ngrowth\u2016 (footnote 33). ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy refers specifically to ADB's \nrole  in  strengthening  the  finance  sector,  including  housing  finance,  in  developing  member \ncountries. ADB\u2019s Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division\u2019s Business Plan and Priorities, \n2010\u2013201234 also states that ADB will support housing finance projects as one of the major \ncomponents for a healthy finance sector. In addition, ADB\u2019s Finance Sector Operational Plan \nhighlights the need to support housing finance projects as part of FSD in developing member \n                                                \n30 ADB. 2008.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n34.  The investment is classified category FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. DVB\u2019s business activities have minimal or no \nadverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples. DVB will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, exclude all projects \nthat will have adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). DVB will confirm this in its periodic reports to ADB and need not apply \nany other specific safeguard requirements.36 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n35.  DVB was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n36.  The proposed senior unsecured loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, \nand single investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n37.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),37 \nthe Government of Sri Lanka will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to DVB. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed senior unsecured loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $15,000,000 to DFCC Vardhana Bank for the Housing Finance Project in Sri Lanka, from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n6 August 2012 \n                                                \n35 ADB. 2011.
