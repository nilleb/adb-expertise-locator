I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nand partial risk guarantees (PRGs) for the Reliance Bangladesh Liquefied Natural Gas and Power \nProject in Bangladesh, comprising: (i) a loan of up to $182,000,000; a PRG for commercial bank \nloans of up to $180,000,000 covering principal, interest, and PRG fees; and a PRG of up to \n$60,000,000 covering breakage costs of interest rate swaps for these commercial bank loans for \nReliance Bangladesh LNG and Power Limited (RBLPL); and (ii) a loan of up to $71,000,000; a \nPRG for commercial bank loans of up to $70,000,000 covering principal, interest, and PRG fees; \nand a PRG of up to $20,000,000 covering breakage costs of interest rate swaps for these \ncommercial bank loans for Reliance Bangladesh LNG Terminal Limited (RBLTL). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n2.  Project identification. Bangladesh has chronic power shortages. Despite increases in \ninstalled generation capacity since 2010, the country has been facing widening peak deficits in \npower generation1 since power demand continues to increase and older generation plants are \nshut down for long periods of maintenance. The country\u2019s heavy dependence on natural gas for \npower generation2 and declining domestic gas reserves exacerbate this deficit. The fertilizer \nindustry and transport sector in Bangladesh, which also use natural gas, have suffered similar \nlimitations of gas availability. In May 2017, 46% of demand from power generators and 57% of \ndemand from fertilizer manufacturers were not met because of gas supply shortage.3 As of June \n2016, the total remaining recoverable domestic gas reserves were estimated at 13.6 trillion cubic \nfeet,4 and these are expected to be exhausted by 2026. The widening power demand\u2013supply gap \nand the impending gas shortage have resulted in the Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of \nPower, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) (i) developing the Power System Master Plan, \n2010 (updated in 2016), which calls for greater private sector investments in power generation; \n(ii) passing the Power and Energy Fast Supply Enhancement (Special Provision) Act, 2010, which \nprovides a role for the private sector to import, regasify, and supply liquefied natural gas (LNG); \nand (iii) establishing a gas development fund, to accelerate gas exploration, production, and \ndiversification of gas supply, including the import of LNG.5 \n \n3.  To address the power deficit and gas supply shortage, Reliance Power Limited (RPL) \nsubmitted a proposal to the MPEMR in 2015 to develop 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power \ngeneration capacity and terminal facilities for the import of LNG for power generation. The power \ngeneration capacity was proposed to be developed in three phases and locations.6 In 2016, RPL \nreceived approval from the government to develop the first phase (the project), which consists of \n(i) a 718 MW7 combined cycle power plant (CCPP), using natural gas as fuel; and (ii) LNG import \ninfrastructure  (the  LNG  Terminal)  supplying  regasified  LNG  (RLNG)  into  the  national  gas \n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Power Development Board. 2017.

The LNG supply will be arranged by the national oil and gas company, \nBangladesh Oil, Gas & Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla), and delivered by LNG suppliers to an \noffshore floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU),8 which will be connected to the LNG \nTerminal facilities. The FSRU will be owned and operated separately by a third party, and will be \nleased under a time charter party agreement. \n \n4.  Project design. The project involves the following two components: \n \n(i)  Combined cycle power plant. The CCPP consists of two 9F Class General \nElectric gas turbines, two  heat  recovery  steam generators,  and  one  steam  turbine, \ntogether with auxiliary equipment and supporting infrastructure at the site. The gross \ngeneration output of the CCPP is 745 MW and the net generation output is 718 MW. When \ncomplete, the CCPP will sell net power generated to Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB) according to the terms of a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA). \nThe CCPP will be located on land provided by BPDB under a land lease agreement. \nSupporting infrastructure at the site will include electrical equipment, control systems, raw \nwater  treatment  and  cooling  water  systems,  and  gas  and  power  transmission \ninterconnection facilities. A subsidiary of Petrobangla will supply natural gas to the CCPP. \n \n(ii)  Liquefied natural gas terminal. The LNG Terminal, to be developed off the coast \nof Kutubdia Island, consists of a mooring point, a jetty, and an 18-kilometer long 30-inch \nwide natural gas pipeline, which will connect the FSRU to a metering point at Valve Station \n2 in Napura. RBLTL will operate the LNG Terminal\u2019s facilities.  Petrobangla and its \nsubsidiaries own and operate the national gas transmission grid.  \n \n5.  The borrowers. The project components described above will be owned and operated by \ntwo separate borrowers: (i) RBLPL, a privately owned company incorporated in Bangladesh to \ndevelop, own, and operate the CCPP; and (ii) RBLTL, a privately owned company incorporated \nin Bangladesh to develop, own, and operate the LNG Terminal. Both RBLPL and RBLTL are \nwholly owned by RPL, via its wholly owned subsidiaries.   \n \n6.  The sponsor. RPL was incorporated in 1995 to develop, own, and operate power projects \nin India and international markets. RPL is the largest private sector power producer in India and \noperates 5,945 MW of power generation capacity in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, \nMaharashtra, and Rajasthan.9 RPL\u2019s power plants generate power from thermal and renewable \nenergy sources, and the average annual availability of all plants was over 90% during FY2017. \nRPL\u2019s power plants sell power generated under long-term PPAs with predetermined stable tariffs. \nDuring FY2017, RPL aggregate revenue was reported at \u20b9108.9 billion; earnings before interest, \ntax, depreciation, and amortization were \u20b946.4 billion; cash flow from operations was \u20b946.7 billion; \nand net profit was \u20b911.0 billion. As of 31 March 2017, RPL\u2019s total assets were \u20b9641.7 billion and \nits net worth was \u20b9213.7 billion. RPL was listed in 2007, and shares are traded on India\u2019s National \nStock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. As of 30 June 2017, RPL\u2019s market capitalization \nwas \u20b9130.9 billion and the company has a credit rating of BBB from ICRA Limited.10 \n \n7.

", "  3 \n  \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n8.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: Power and Energy Sector Master \nPlan for Bangladesh (2016), Vision 2041 objectives of enhancing imported energy infrastructure, \nand constructing a robust, high-quality power network.11 It will help address a widening gap \nbetween the demand and supply of electricity and natural gas, both of which are critical for \ncontinued industrial and economic growth. The project will increase available de-rated generation \ncapacity by about 10% and provide 12.5% of the targeted LNG terminal capacity by 2041 (footnote \n5). The development of infrastructure to import LNG will ensure that Bangladesh can continue to \nuse existing gas-fired power generation capacity even while domestic gas reserves are declining \nand will be eventually exhausted. The long-term assured availability of natural gas via imports will \n(i) reduce the need to import other fuels like coal or liquid fuel, which are more harmful to the \nenvironment; (ii) allow the phasing out of expensive, short-term rental power plants that rely on \nimported fuel oil, reducing the cost of purchased power for BPDB; and (iii) result in national foreign \nexchange savings where the import of more expensive imported fuel oil is reduced. \n \n9.  Outcome. The project's outcome will be increased ability of Bangladesh\u2019s electricity and \ngas systems to respond to demand. \n \n10.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs are the development and commissioning of the CCPP, \nand infrastructure to facilitate the import and transmission of 500 million standard cubic feet per \nday of gas, along with the associated job creation and support for the growth of the local economy. \nGender responsive stakeholder consultations and community engagement will be carried out. The \nproject is expected to create 1,000 jobs in the construction phase. ADB\u2019s PRG has mobilized \nseveral international commercial banks, which will be lending to an infrastructure project in \nBangladesh for the first time. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n11.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports \ninfrastructure development and private sector operations, two of ADB\u2019s main strategic priorities \nfor 2014\u20132020.12 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh highlights nine priority areas, \nof which the project is aligned with three: (i) easing infrastructure constraints, (ii) providing climate \nand disaster-resilient infrastructure and services, and (iii) creating conditions for greater private \nsector participation.13 Easing of infrastructure constraints in the energy sector is a core priority for \nthe government, and the country partnership strategy identifies two key outcomes that ADB \ncontributes to: (i) an increase in access to electricity from 72% of households in 2015 to 96% by \n2020, and (ii) an increase in per capita generation of electricity from 371 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in \n2015 to 514 kWh by 2020. Led by RPL, the project involves a foreign direct investment, and \nknowledge transfer of developing and operating energy infrastructure, from India to Bangladesh. \nReliance is the first among several Indian companies to pursue activities aligned with efforts by \nboth governments to increase Indian investments in Bangladesh. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s \noperational plan for regional cooperation and integration.14  \n \n                                                \n11 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2016.

The Assistance \n \n16.  ADB  will  provide:  (i)  a  loan  of  up  to  $182,000,000  to  RBLPL;  a  PRG  of  up  to \n$180,000,00015 covering principal, interest, and PRG fees, for commercial lenders in connection \nwith their loans to RBLPL; and a PRG of up to $60,000,00016 covering breakage costs of interest \nrate swaps for swap counterparties in connection with commercial loans to RBLPL; and (ii) a loan \nof up to $71,000,000 to RBLTL; a PRG of up to $70,000,00017 covering principal, interest, and \nPRG fees, for commercial lenders in connection with their loans to RBLTL; and a PRG of up to \n$20,000,00018 covering  breakage  costs  of  interest  rate  swaps  for  swap  counterparties  in \nconnection with commercial loans to RBLTL. As a senior secured lender, ADB will have a first \nranking charge over the project\u2019s fixed and movable assets; an assignment of the two borrowers\u2019 \nrights under the project agreements, licenses, and approvals; bank accounts; insurances; and \nshare pledges, to the extent available. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s role as a direct lender and guarantee provider will enable the project to mobilize \nmuch-needed long-term debt financing, which has very limited availability in the domestic and \ninternational  markets.  The  quantum  of  financing  for  a  private  sector  project  is  considered \nsubstantial, and has been made available by mobilizing commercial lenders (through ADB\u2019s risk \nmitigation via its PRG), many of which are lending for the first time in Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement significantly enhances environmental and social standards for the project. Corporate \ngovernance standards are at an internationally acceptable level because of the presence of \ninternational lenders, led by ADB. Successful financing of the project will establish precedents for \nfuture financings of similar projects, including integrated LNG and power projects, by boosting \ninvestor and lender confidence. \n \nC.

Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  The project is classified category A for environment under the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) (SPS). There are two environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) \nstudies undertaken for the CCPP and the LNG Terminal. The ESIAs identify the environmental \nimpacts and risks and incorporate, in procedures and plans, adequate measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate and compensate for potential adverse impacts associated with the project \nconstruction and operation. The ESIAs comply with (i) SPS requirements, (ii)  International \nFinance Corporation Environmental Health and Safety guidelines, and (iii) national legislation.  \n \n27.  The CCPP\u2019s ESIA includes a detailed evaluation of air quality. The CCPP will utilize natural \ngas as fuel and the pollutants of potential concern are mainly oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The CCPP \nwill  minimize  its  contribution  to  ambient  air  quality  (AAQ)  through  the  use  of  gas  turbines \nincorporating dry, low NOx burners. An air quality evaluation using United States Environmental \nProtection Agency (USEPA) approved dispersion emission modeling included project emissions \nfrom the CCPP and cumulative emissions from other power plants in the area.19 Modelled NOx \nconcentrations were in compliance with the applicable criteria. Dispersion modelling indicates the \nbackground  level  of  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO )  in  the  project  area  will  be  compliant  with  the \n2\ngovernment\u2019s National AAQ Standards, World Health Organization AAQ Guidelines, and U.S. \nNational AAQ Standards. The CCPP water requirement will be met by Meghna River, a perennial \nriver flowing adjacent to the CCPP site. As  the CCPP will utilize a closed circuit cooling system, \nlow volumes of water extraction and discharge will occur. This will  ensure minimal (less than 3\u00b0 \nCelsius) rise above the ambient river temperature at the point of discharge and hence no significant \nimpact on the river fish population is anticipated. An online monitoring system will measure water \nparameters at the discharge point. Since the area is prone to cyclones, the CCPP\u2019s project design \nmakes provisions to avoid risks due to flooding or sea level rise.  \n \n28.  The LNG Terminal and FSRU will be located off the west coast of Kutubdia Island. While \nthe terminal itself and the FSRU\u2019s activities will generate limited air, noise and water impacts, \nRBLTL has developed procedures and plans for adequate management of these impacts. The \nESIA found that endangered terrestrial and marine flora and fauna, such as Olive Ridley turtles \nand dolphins, are not expected to be adversely impacted by the project and the ESIA properly \n                                                \n19 The CCPP will not be operated under single cycle as per the power purchase agreement (PPA).  \n ", "6   \nidentifies and evaluates impacts and risks on the biodiversity. The ESIA details measures to \navoid, minimize, or mitigate these risks in the environmental management plan. ADB\u2019s due \ndiligence confirms that RBLTL is committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions for \nstaff and contractors. Operational risks are identified and appropriate  mitigation measures, \nincluding an emergency response and disaster management plan, are in place. \n \n29.  Due diligence confirmed the adequacy of the institutional capacity and commitment of the \nborrowers to manage the project\u2019s environmental and social impacts. RPL conducted meaningful \nconsultations with relevant stakeholders at the project sites, and the ESIA report was disclosed on \nthe ADB website on 16 March 2017. Community liaison officers will be deployed to develop, \nimplement and manage stakeholder engagement and grievance redress mechanisms for the \nproject. The borrowers are committed to implementing the necessary mitigation measures, with \nsubmission of semiannual progress reports, to comply with ADB\u2019s SPS requirements.  \n \n30.  The project is classified Category B for involuntary resettlement and Category C for \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s SPS. The CCPP will not require any land acquisition as it will \nbe located on government land. Impact on seasonal grazing activity at the site is expected to be \ninsignificant since this will continue undisrupted in vacant areas belonging to BPDB. Further, \nRBLPL  has  committed  to  providing  assistance  to  cattle  owners  as  part  of  its  community \nengagement activities. RBLPL will locate transmission towers, connecting the CCPP to the \ntransmission network, within BPDB land, avoiding any land utilized for seasonal cultivation and \nalso avoiding impact on standing crops and assets. At the LNG Terminal site, exclusion zones or \nrestriction of movement of fishing communities are not anticipated during the construction and \noperation of the subsea pipeline. Involuntary resettlement impacts are expected from land \nacquisition for the gas pipeline connecting the FSRU to the metering station. The land acquisition \nand resettlement for the pipeline will be undertaken by Petrobangla and is expected to be \ncompleted in 2018. RBLTL will bear the cost of resettlement activites. Preparation of resettlement \nplans for the pipeline, in line with ADB\u2019s SPS, is not possible at this stage since the alignment has \nnot been finalized and therefore there is limited preparedness for land acquisition. Based on the \nassessment of the preliminary pipeline alignment, involuntary resettlement impacts are not \nexpected to be significant given that (i) all land acquired for the pipeline will be compensated at \nreplacement costs and will also be available to land owners for continued use after construction \nof the pipeline, and (ii) permanent impact related to land acquisition will be limited to about 23 \nhouseholds who cultivate a four acre plot proposed for the valve station. To address involuntary \nresettlement impacts, Petrobangla will prepare and implement a Resettlement Plan (RP) following \nthe Resettlement Framework, consistent with World Bank Operational Policies and ADB\u2019s SPS.20  \n \n31.  The borrowers will report to ADB on compliance with SPS, including implementation of the \nRP.  Due  diligence  and  stakeholder  consultations  confirmed  that  there  are  no  outstanding \ngrievances or complaints associated with the ownership or use of land at project locations. No \nindigenous peoples reside in or around the project areas, or are expected to be affected by the \nproject. The project is not expected to affect territories or natural and cultural resources owned, \nused, occupied, or claimed by indigenous peoples as their ancestral domain. \n  \n32.  During  construction  phase,  civil  works  contractors  are  expected  to  provide  work \nopportunities for the local community. The borrowers will comply with national labor laws and, \npursuant to ADB's Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The \nborrowers commit to preferential engagement of women in all project related employment, target \n                                                \n20 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Information disclosure and consultations with \naffected people are conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.21 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  RPL, as the ultimate owner of RBLPL and RBLTL, was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of \nimplementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and \nthe  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes \nappropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, \nand remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n34.  The proposed loans and guarantees are within the medium-term, country, industry, group, \nand single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n35.
