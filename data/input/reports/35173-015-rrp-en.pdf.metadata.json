Since  the  establishment  of  276  urban  municipalities  in  2015,  58%  of \n3. \nNepal\u2019s  population  of  29  million  is  urban.  Out  of  3,900  municipalities,  including  58  urban \nmunicipalities,  the  Constitution  of  Nepal  (2015)  created  7  provinces  and  77  districts  with  6 \nmetropolitan and 11 sub-metropolitan cities, and 276 urban and 460 rural municipalities. Rapid \nurbanization\u2014resulting from migration, reclassification, and natural increase\u2014has widened the \nurban  infrastructure  deficit.  Unmanaged  urban  growth  and  lack  of  improved  WSS  have  led  to \nenvironmental degradation, public health risks, increased vulnerability to the impacts of climate \nchange  and  natural  hazards,  a  rise  in  urban  poverty,3 and  hampered  economic  growth.  Since \n2000,  Nepal  has  made  strong  efforts  to  improve  access  to  WSS.  It  increased  water  supply \ncoverage from 73% to 84% and basic sanitation coverage from 30% to 81% between 2000 and \n2015.4 Yet  in  2016,  only  34%  of  water  supply  was  reported  to  be  safe  and  only  15%  met  the \nnational water quality standards. More efforts are also needed to achieve improved sanitation: \nonly 34% of urban households have septic tanks and only 15% have sewer connections. Fecal \nsludge  management  and  sanitation  for  marginalized  groups,  especially  for  women  and  poor \nhouseholds, remain a challenge.5 Overall, municipalities find it difficult to provide adequate, cost-\neffective  services  because  they  lack  funds  and  skilled  personnel,  and  sufficient  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) budgets. \n \nSector  policy  and  institutional  arrangements.  The  government  targets 6  for  WSS \n4. \nservices focus on inclusive development for improved functionality, enhanced service levels, and \nexpanded municipal sanitation, covering all citizens, including poor and vulnerable groups.7 The \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.

Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and \n\nHygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines. Geneva. \n\n6  The sector objectives are laid out by the government\u2019s National Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy, \n2009;  the  Fourteenth  Three-Year  Plan,  2016;  the  updated  15-year  Development  Plan  for  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation in Small Towns, 2015; and the National Urban Development Strategy, 2017. \n\n \n \n\n\fgovernment has defined sectoral institutional responsibilities and service delivery mechanisms.8 \nThe Ministry of Water Supply (MOWS) is responsible for planning, implementation, and regulation \nof WSS; its Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) supports the provision of WSS \nfacilities in municipalities where large utilities do not exist, and these are operated by water users\u2019 \nand sanitation committees (WUSCs)9 or municipalities. \n \n5. \nRecently,  the  Local  Governance  Operation  Act,  2017,  entrusted  municipalities  with \nresponsibility for WSS services. While municipalities\u2019 capacity for this responsibility is being built, \nthe government  and  residents  have been receptive to  a  decentralized,  participatory,  and cost-\nsharing  service  provision  model  through  water  users\u2019  associations  (WUAs)  and  WUSCs. \nDevelopment  support  for  municipal  WSS  has  been  channeled  through  a  combination  of \n(i) government grants through the DWSS, (ii) loans by the Town Development Fund (TDF),10 and \n(iii) contributions from municipalities and beneficiaries.11 \n \nPast  support  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  successfully12 \n6. \nsupported the government in improving WSS services in 70 small towns13 through three projects \n(footnote 1), introducing continuous water supply and providing universal household connections, \nincluding  subsidized  connections  and  affordable  supply  for  poor  and  vulnerable  households.14 \nThe  project  will  continue  the  \u201csmall  towns\u201d  model  developed  with  ADB  support  involving  (i)  a \ndemand-driven, cost-sharing approach that strengthens ownership and inclusion of women and \nmarginalized groups; (ii) use of explicit, performance-based subsidies to deliver services to poor \nand  vulnerable  groups;  (iii) use  of  a  participatory  financing  mechanism  with  partial  investment \ncost recovery; (iv) introduction of tariffs that allow to recover O&M and debt service costs; and (v) \nWUSCs  as  service  operators.15 The  model  is  considered  successful  by  the  government  and \ndevelopment  partners. 16  ADB  also  significantly  supported  urban  WSS  in  water-stressed \nKathmandu Valley, which includes tapping additional water from Melamchi River through a 26-\nkilometer  (km)  diversion  tunnel.17 Adopting  a  harmonized  approach  in  assisting  Nepal\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment,  ADB  is  also  supporting  resilient  delivery  of  urban  services  and  facilities  in  eight \n\n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n9  The WUSCs, formed under the Nepal Water Resource Act (1992), are the elected executive bodies of WUAs. \n10 The TDF is a government-owned entity established under the Town Development Fund Act, 1997. Loans from the \ngovernment to WUAs or municipalities are generally onlent by the TDF under a subproject financing agreement. The \nTDF also supports WUAs in institutional and financial management, including introduction of tariffs. \n\n11 WUAs contribute 30% of civil works costs for water supply subprojects (25% from the TDF loan and 5% from users\u2019 \nupfront cash contribution), and 15% of civil works costs for sanitation subprojects (subsidy from municipalities). \n12 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2018.

It  also \nincorporated adequate measures based on lessons from previous projects, such as (i) obtaining \nbetter  quality  assurance  and  control  measures  for  subproject  designs  by  engaging  dedicated \nproject management and quality assurance consultants for the entire project period, (ii) ensuring \nthat  subproject  designs  incur  combined  capital  and  O&M  expenditures  at  least-cost,  and  (iii) \nupdating existing DWSS design guidelines to factor in climate and disaster risks. Institutional and \nfinancial  improvements  include  (i)  consulting  service  inputs  for  TDF  and  ISSAU  to  provide \ntechnical, utility management, and corporatization support to WUAs27 and project municipalities; \n(ii)  adoption  of  tariff  guidelines  and  management  agreements  between  WUAs  or  project \nmunicipalities  and  the  DWSS  with  clear  definition  of  roles  and  responsibilities;  (iii) a  subsidy \nmechanism to ensure coverage of the poor;28 and (iv) adequate capacity and resources for future \nsubproject  preparation.  To  improve  sustainability,  the  project  will  support  1 year  of  O&M  in  all \nworks contracts including on the job training for WUSC technical staff. Subprojects are driven by \ndemand from WUAs and project municipalities, and selected along transparent criteria, including \npopulation  growth,  poverty  index,  existing  WSS  infrastructure,  community  willingness  for  cost \nsharing, and long-term O&M contract.29  \n \nClimate  change  resilience  and  adaptation  measures.  The  project  is  categorized  as \n19. \nmedium for climate change impact and a climate risk and vulnerability analysis was conducted. \nThe  DWSS  design  guidelines  incorporate  a  separate  section  on  climate  change  containing \nassessment  and  adaptation  procedures for reducing the  impact  of  climate change on  physical \ninvestments  and  building  project  municipalities\u2019  resilience.  Subproject  designs  incorporate \nspecific  measures  such  as  (i)  groundwater  source  from  deeper  aquifers  where  yields  are  not \naffected by changes in precipitation, (ii) pipes to be laid below ground to avoid damage during \nfloods,  (iii)  source  protection,  (iv)  no  construction  in  floodplains  and  landslide-prone  areas, \n(v) additional free-board allowance to design parameters, (vi) power backup generators to ensure \noperation, and (vii) adoption of water conservation and awareness-raising measures.30 \n                                                \n27 The ISSAU will assist WUAs in their corporatization, either as a water board under the Water Supply Management \n\nBoard Act, 2006, or as a company under the Companies Act, 2006. \n\n28 The project will cover all poor and vulnerable households (including 100% poor households headed by women) by \nproviding a 100% upfront cash contribution subsidy for water supply and a 90% subsidy for  toilets through output-\nbased aid, e.g., reimbursing the contractors upon completion of the toilet facilities. \n\n29 Detailed subproject selection criteria and the list of pre-selected project municipalities are in the PAM (footnote 25). \nSelection of future investments to be designed under the project will follow the same criteria, with preference for \ninvestments located in Kathmandu Valley, provincial headquarters, and strategic border municipalities. Subproject \nprocurement can only start once the DWSS and a municipality sign a management agreement with the local WUSC \nfor 20 years of O&M service. The municipality will own the system and the WUSC will operate it. \n\n30 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n20. \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound \nsince the project aims to provide more sustainable urban WSS services. The economic internal \nrates  of return of  three sample WSS  subprojects  range from  12.3% to 16.4%,  higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. Most of the \nsample subprojects have also yielded satisfactory results when subjected to a sensitivity analysis \nusing the following downside risks: (i) a capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) an overrun in operation \nand  management  costs  of  20%,  (iii)  a  decline  in  estimated  benefits  of  20%,  (iv)  a  1-year \nimplementation delay, and (v) all of the above downside risks combined. The project will increase \nits economic viability even further if unquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements \nare included in the analysis.31 \n \n21. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  financial  analysis  was  conducted  on  three  sample  WSS \nsubprojects  by  estimating  cash  flows  over  the  project  life  to  ensure  that  the  subprojects  will \ngenerate sufficient revenues to cover incremental recurrent costs, including full O&M and debt \nservice  costs.32 A  government  grant  is  funding  70%  of  civil  works  costs  for  the  water  supply \nsubprojects,  and  85%  of  civil  costs  for  sanitation  subprojects  and  all  other  costs,  such  as \nequipment and consulting services. Revenue streams are not intended for full cost recovery, but \nto recover incremental recurrent costs. An incremental recurrent cost recovery analysis revealed \nthat all sample subprojects would generate sufficient revenues from water tariffs to fully recover \nincremental  recurrent  costs  through  periodic  tariff  revisions.  The  PMO  and  TDF  will  provide \ncapacity  building  and  hand-holding  support  to  WUSCs  on  tariff  fixation,  revenue  mobilization, \nawareness campaigns, and consultations on the project to improve the financial efficiency and \nsustainability of WSS services.33 \n \nC. \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  showed  that  the  DWSS  and  TDF  could  conduct \n22. \nfinancial  management  of  the  project  adequately.  The  two  entities  have  sufficient  experience \nhandling ADB-funded projects. They are also implementing the ongoing ADB-funded Third Small \nTowns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  satisfactorily  in  terms  of  timely  receipt  of \nproject funds, including counterpart funds; efficient project management with adequate staff; and \nprompt  disbursement  of  funds  to  contractors  and  consultants.  The  procurement  assessment \nconcluded  that  the  overall  procurement  risk  for  the  project  is  moderate. 34  The  overall  risk \nassessment for the project is moderate. Risk mitigation measures include (i) securing commitment \nof the government and the DWSS to ensure timely establishment of WUSCs with qualified staff, \n(ii) extending  full  training  and  skills  development  support  to  boost  the  PMO\u2019s  financial \nmanagement capacity, and (iii) appointing or recruiting qualified staff to fill the vacant positions in \nthe finance section of the TDF. Close monitoring and the resolution of these capacity gaps will be \nimplemented with the support of the loan consultants.35 \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MOWS,  DWSS,  and  TDF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Debt service costs include 25% share of civil works costs for water supply components to be covered by a TDF loan. \n33 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n24. \nThe  project,  classified  as  gender  equity  theme,  has  approaches  and  implementation \ninterventions  directly  focusing  on  gender  and  social  inclusion  by  providing  sustainable  water \nsupply and improved sanitation services in project municipalities.36 Inclusion and coverage of all \npoor and vulnerable37 households in a subproject coverage area is ensured through subsidized \nconnections  to  piped  water  supply  and  output-based  aid  for  sanitation  infrastructure.  The \nimprovement  in  WSS  infrastructure\u2014individual  water  connections  and  toilets\u2014will  benefit \nwomen, in particular, by decreasing the average time per day spent on collecting and managing \nwater. The framework for inclusion in the PAM outlines the provision of WSS services for poor \nand vulnerable households, including full subsidy for water supply connections and up to 90% \nsubsidy for individual toilets through output-based aid to ensure affordability and access to better \nservice. A lifeline tariff subsidy for water supply supports continuous affordability of water user \ncharges  by  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  The  project  benefits  the  poor,  women,  and \nvulnerable people  by  ensuring their  participation  in project-related  consultations,  training  units, \nwork generation, and awareness campaigns. Women\u2019s empowerment is targeted through their \nparticipation  in  decision-making.  The WUSCs  are  required  to  have  women  (at  least  33%)  and \nrepresentatives of marginalized ethnic groups among their members, and for a woman to occupy \nat least one of the key posts (chair, vice chair, or treasurer). A gender equality and social inclusion \naction  plan 38 ensures  that  activities  to  mainstream  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  are \nimplemented and monitored at regular intervals. Data, disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and social \nand economic background, will be collected. Resources are allocated for the implementation and \nmonitoring of the action plan. \n \nE. \n \n25. \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n26. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  PMO  prepared  an  environmental  assessment  review \nframework  (EARF)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  applicable \ngovernment environmental regulation to provide guidance on subproject selection, screening and \ncategorization,  information  disclosure  and  consultation,  assessment,  planning,  institutional \narrangement,  and  processes  to  be  followed  during  project  implementation.  Five  sample \nsubprojects were appraised, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports were prepared \nin  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  EARF. 40  The  IEEs  also  include  an \nenvironmental compliance audit of existing facilities that will be rehabilitated or expanded under \nthe project.41 The sample IEEs and information on project municipalities indicate that there are no \necologically  sensitive  areas,  planned  infrastructure  will  only  require  small  footprints,  and  the \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n36 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Vulnerable  people are defined  as those suffering  the effects  of marginalization  within  or  outside their  community \nbecause  of  their  ethnicity,  gender,  caste,  religion,  disability,  health,  education,  or  socioeconomic  status.  For  the \npurpose  of  this  project,  this  specifically  includes  Dalit,  disabled,  disaster-affected,  marginalized,  and  endangered \nindigenous groups that are politically, socially, or economically excluded. \n\n38 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 ADB.

Currently, treated water quality meets both Nepal and World Health Organization guideline values. \nRaw water quality is good, and water treatment plants do not generate considerable amounts of sludge. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fpotential impacts are site-specific\u2014few if any of them are irreversible42 and can in most cases be \nreadily  mitigated  and  minimized  by  applying  proven  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally \nsound  engineering  and  construction  practices  consistent  with  international  good  practices. \nStakeholders were involved through meaningful consultations and views expressed were fed into \nIEEs and subprojects. The consultation process will be continued during project implementation \nto ensure that stakeholders are fully engaged. The environmental management plans (EMPs) will \nform part of the bid and contract documents. The IEEs were prepared with site-specific EMPs and \nmonitoring program, and submitted to ADB, and no works will start until final IEEs are reviewed \nand approved by ADB. The EARF and IEEs were disclosed on ADB and project websites, and to \naffected people. A grievance redress mechanism is included in the PAM. Adequate consulting \nsupport is included in the project to ensure satisfactory environmental compliance. The PMO will \nreport to ADB on EMP implementation twice a year. \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  To  guide  subproject  preparation,  the  PMO \nprepared  a  resettlement  framework  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the \nGovernment of Nepal\u2019s policies, and a sample resettlement plan and four sample due diligence \nreports. 43 Private land acquisition for sample subprojects is not needed. The resettlement plan, \nprepared for a sample WSS subproject, assesses the impact on common property resources and \nprovides  suitable  mitigation  measures.  The  DWSS  has  some  experience  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring  category  B  subprojects  for  involuntary  resettlement  safeguards  under  ADB-funded \nprojects. The grievance redress mechanism will address issues and grievances in a timely and \neffective manner. The PMO will submit semiannual social safeguard monitoring reports to ADB \nand  will  be  supported  by  loan  consultants  in  monitoring  compliance  with  safeguards.  No \nsubprojects rated category A for involuntary resettlement will be included. \n \n28. \nIndigenous peoples (category B). To guide subproject preparation, the PMO prepared \nan indigenous peoples planning framework in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nthe Government of Nepal\u2019s policies. Field visits confirmed the presence of indigenous peoples\u2019 \ngroups in one of the sample municipalities, who will be included in project benefits. Indigenous \npeoples\u2019 groups who are traditional users of surface water sources proposed for a municipal water \nsupply  system  are  also  identified,  and  a  sample  indigenous  peoples  plan  was  prepared. 44 \nPrevious  ADB  projects  implemented  by  the  DWSS  were  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \nsafeguards. Capacity building of PMO staff as well as training of municipal officials and WUAs on \nindigenous peoples\u2019 safeguards, and refresher training sessions on involuntary resettlement will \nbe required. Regional PMOs, municipalities, and WUAs will need capacity support from the social \nsafeguards  consultant  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples \nplans. No subprojects rated category A for indigenous peoples will be included. \n \nF. \n \n29. \n                                                \n42 Potential impacts during construction arise from excavations and include (i) health and safety hazards to workers, \n(ii) noise and dust, (iii) increased road traffic, and (iv) soil erosion and silt runoff from stockpiled materials and wastes. \nDuring operation, facilities may generate noise and odor from sanitation, sewage treatment, and discharges to the \nenvironment. The IEEs set performance standards on key environmental parameters like noise, odor, and discharge \nin line with international good practice (as set out in World Bank\u2013International Finance Corporation Environmental, \nHealth and Safety guidelines) and the Government of Nepal\u2019s requirements. \n\nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.45 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n43 Resettlement  Framework,  Resettlement  Plan,  and  Due  Diligence  Reports  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\n44 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\nin Appendix 2). \n\n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nChanges in government \nstructures may jeopardize the \ninstitutional arrangements and \nproject implementation. \nClimate change and extreme \nevents will undermine the \nsmooth operation of facilities. \nWUSCs may fail to sustain \ncapacity to operate and \nmaintain investments and \neffectively provide services. \nWUSCs may not increase tariffs \nto sustain the systems. \n\nMitigation Measures \nImplementation and fund-flow structures that were successfully established in \nearlier projects funded by the Asian Development Bank will remain in place. \nRoles of stakeholders are clearly defined, and formation of water users\u2019\nassociations and WUSCs will ensure consensus among key stakeholders. \nDesign standards will include assessment of climate and disaster risks. Project \nmanagement and quality assurance consultants will ensure that appropriate \ndesign features are incorporated in subproject design. \nThe project will (i) provide 1-year operation and maintenance support through \ncontractors, and staff training for the first 6 months before operations takeover; \nand (ii) support business plan preparation and establishment of necessary utility \nmanagement tools for computerized billing, accounting, and auditing. \nTariff guidelines will be prepared.
