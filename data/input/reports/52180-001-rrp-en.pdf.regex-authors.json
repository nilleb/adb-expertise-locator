I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $10,000,000 in Ascent Myanmar Growth Fund I L.P. in Myanmar.  \n \n2.  The fund is a closed-end private equity fund established in Singapore as a limited \npartnership and will invest through Ascent Myanmar Growth Fund Private Limited, a private \nlimited company incorporated in Singapore (collectively, AMGF). The fund will invest primarily \nequity capital for growth purposes in middle-market companies, including small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  operating  in  Myanmar.1 Focus  sectors  include  consumer,  education, \nfinancial services, health care, and technology, media and telecommunications. Investing in \nAMGF will allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to contribute to Myanmar\u2019s economic growth \nwhile providing development benefits, including supporting female entrepreneurs. The proposed \ninvestment will help deepen capital markets in Myanmar by providing scarce growth equity capital \nto  Myanmar\u2019s  middle-market  companies,  including  SMEs.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  investment  is \nexpected to catalyze private sector investment into Myanmar and encourage international best \npractices of investment.  \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Description.  Ascent  Capital  Partners  Pte.  Ltd.  is  a  newly  established  Singapore-\nregistered private equity fund manager that aims to invest in middle-market companies, including \nSMEs, in Myanmar. The firm was founded and is indirectly owned by its two managing partners, \nChong Chong Lim and Tee Keong Pneh. [This information has been removed as it falls under the \nexception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Ascent Capital \nplans to build a team of up to 16 staff, with 13 investment team professionals (including the two \nmanaging partners and a dedicated portfolio management team of three operating professionals), \nand three supporting finance and administrative staff.  \n \n4.  Ascent Capital is raising its first private equity fund with a target capitalization of $100 \nmillion. Ascent General Partner Private Limited will be incorporated to act as its general partner. \nThe general partner will engage Ascent Capital as its investment manager, which will (i) identify, \nevaluate, and structure potential investments for AMGF; (ii) participate in the management of \nportfolio companies; and (iii) provide administrative functions.2 \n \n5.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].3 The collective experience of the anchor investors \nand the two founders in executing and managing investments and navigating the complex legal \nand political landscape in Myanmar, is essential to Ascent Capital\u2019s success. [This information \nhas been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].4 \n \n \n1  Middle market companies and SMEs are defined as companies with typical enterprise value of $2 million\u2013$50 million. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n3  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n4  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] ", "2 \n6.  Investment identification. ADB has been tracking several private equity fund managers \nin frontier countries in South and Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, \nPakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mongolia. Myanmar has shown consistent growth in gross domestic \nproduct over the past since 2008 and is increasingly being scoped by private equity investors \nbecause of its improving investment landscape. According to the World Bank, Myanmar\u2019s gross \ndomestic product grew at an average of 7.9% during 2008\u20132017.5 Despite this achievement, \nMyanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia with 32.1% of the population \nliving below the national poverty line.6 Rapid growth is expected to continue because of four key \nadvantages: (i) ample investment opportunities in essential services and infrastructure because \nof the country\u2019s political and economic isolation during 1990-2011; (ii) strategic location between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and India, with access to 40% of the world\u2019s population; (iii) a \nlarge population of 54 million that offers a young workforce and a strong market base for domestic \nconsumption; and (iv) abundant natural resources. Since the country\u2019s liberalization in 2011, the \nGovernment of Myanmar has increased efforts to improve the investment environment for foreign \ninvestors to enable them to leverage Myanmar\u2019s advantages to drive economic growth.  \n \n7.  The growth rates in Myanmar is comparable to that in several frontier markets, and ADB \nhas been seeking a high-quality fund management team with strong investment and operational \nexperience, backed by credible anchor investors. Ascent Capital meets ADB\u2019s investment criteria. \nThe general partner\u2019s management team is led by Chong Chong Lim, an experienced corporate \nand investment professional with prior working experience at Temasek International; and Tee \nKeong Pneh, an experienced private equity investment professional with prior working experience \nat Maybank Private Equity and Navis Capital Partners.7 Chong Chong Lim was group chief \nfinance officer at the Capital Diamond Star Group, a leading business conglomerate in Myanmar \nwith diversified businesses in agriculture, food, retail, real estate, healthcare, financial services \nand automotive goods. Tee Keong Pneh was chief executive officer of Maybank Private Equity, \nthe private equity arm of Malayan Banking Berhad, where he managed legacy funds, developed \nnew fund management strategy, designed new investment process, led merger and acquisition \ntransactions and communicated with key Maybank stakeholders.  \n \n8.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Although Ascent Capital is a newly established \nplatform with no track record of investing in Myanmar, ADB\u2019s due diligence has confirmed that \nthe two managing partners and two anchor investors have individual management and investment \nexperience, extensive business relationships, and relevant knowledge of the local market and \nregulatory environment to ensure the platform is a success.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  AMGF intends to make 10\u201315 investments of $5 million\u2013$10 million each in fast-growing \nmiddle  market companies,  including  SMEs,  in  the  consumer,  education, financial  services, \nhealth\u2013care, and technology, multimedia, and telecommunications sectors. These will likely be \nfamily-owned companies requiring expansionary capital, including companies facing succession \nchallenges or undergoing transformation because of competitive pressures as Myanmar\u2019s market \ncontinues to liberalize. AMGF will seek joint ventures and/or strategic partnerships where possible \nto enable its smooth entry into the market and share the investment risk with local partners. The \n \n5  World Bank.

AMGF will also identify companies owned and operated by women and young \nentrepreneurs and help improve their business processes and operational efficiency. AMGF will \nseek significant minority or majority stakes to ensure active post-investment operational roles in \ninvestee companies. AMGF\u2019s holding period is expected to be 5\u20137 years; its anticipated exit \nstrategies including trade sales to local and/or foreign strategic buyers, secondary sales to other \nprivate equity funds and financial buyers, and initial public offerings. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership. AMGF is structured as a Singapore limited partnership that will invest all or \nsubstantially all of its assets in a Singapore-incorporated private limited company, which will be \nthe master fund. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n11.  Integrity due diligence and enhanced tax integrity due diligence were conducted.8 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified. After reviewing the transaction, \nADB does not believe that it has been established or is being used for money laundering, terrorism \nfinancing, or cross-border tax evasion. \n \n12.  Management. Ascent Capital is led by its two managing partners, Chong Chong Lim and \nTee Keong Pneh. As of 30 September 2018, the two managing partners have assembled a team \nof  seven  supporting  investment  professionals  and  are  recruiting  a  dedicated  portfolio \nmanagement team of up to three operating professionals. The full team of up to 16 staff will be \nbased in Yangon and is expected to be in place before 30 June 2019, by the fund\u2019s final closing. \nThe portfolio management team is expected to be led by a full-time operating partner that has \nalready been identified by Ascent Capital and will be formally recruited by June 2019. Employee \nrecruitments are expected to be in accordance with its gender policy to ensure equal employment \nopportunities and non-discrimination in the workplace.  \n \n13.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n14.  Where possible, Ascent Capital will seek representation on the boards of its investee \ncompanies to provide strategic and operational guidance. \n \n15.  Governance structure. Ascent Capital\u2019s investment process is structured in four phases \nand includes three investment committee meetings: \n \n(i)  Deal sourcing and initial screening. The investment team will carry out initial \nscreening once an investment opportunity is identified. The investment team will \ndraft a deal alert for the first investment committee meeting. \n \n(ii)  Evaluation and strategic due-diligence. The investment team will review the \nindustry, company, valuation, and value proposition and will draft an investment \n \n8  ADB. 2003.

A \nnon-binding offer will be issued if the investment committee agrees to proceed. \n \n(iii)  Financial and legal due-diligence. The investment team will engage third-party \nlegal and financial advisors for legal and financial due diligence, and will draft and \npresent a due diligence report to the third investment committee meeting after this \nphase. A binding offer will be issued if the investment committee agrees to \nproceed. \n \n(iv)  Documentation and closing. The investment team will negotiate and execute \ndocumentation and close the investment. \n \n16.  Ascent Capital\u2019s portfolio management team is expected to work closely with the fund\u2019s \ninvestment team and the management team of each investee company to drive post-investment \nvalue creation initiatives.  \n \n17.  In addition to the investment committee, AMGF will have an advisory committee with up \nto five members, including one representative from each anchor investor and representatives \nfrom limited partners with capital commitments of at least $20 million. Notwithstanding ADB\u2019s \nproposed investment size, Ascent Capital has agreed to grant ADB a seat on the fund\u2019s advisory \ncommittee. The advisory committee will primarily resolve conflicts of interest and will act in an \nadvisory role to the general partner on matters related to the oversight of AMGF activities. The \nadvisory committee may also offer strategic advice, particularly on policy changes and interaction \nwith regulators, local business dynamics, and general reputational and political issues. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n18.  Ascent Capital is a newly established private equity platform raising its first fund, hence \nthere is no historical financial performance to report. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $10,000,000 in Ascent Myanmar Growth \nFund I L.P. ADB\u2019s proposed investment will not exceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital \nand will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n20.  Ascent Capital has indicated that it aims to achieve a gross internal rate of return of 20% \nin United States dollar terms for the fund. Consistent with market practice and subject to certain \nlimitations, the general partner can recall for the purpose of reinvestment the capital portion of \ndivestment proceeds previously distributed to limited partners. In such a scenario, ADB\u2019s total \ncapital commitment to the fund would remain unchanged. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  Exit strategy. The fund has a 12-year term, subject to two 1-year extensions upon the \nmajority approval of the investors. The anticipated exit strategies for AMGF\u2019s investments are \n ", "5 \n \ntrade sale to foreign and local strategic buyers and secondary sales to regional financial investors. \nAMGF will also selectively consider initial public offerings as an option.  \n \n22.  Reporting arrangements. Ascent Capital will provide ADB with quarterly reports and \naudited annual financial statements, an annual valuation report, an overview of the portfolio with \nbrief information on each portfolio company\u2019s financial performance and valuation, an annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring \nreport that includes performance against gender mainstreaming targets. ADB will review this \ninformation to ensure that Ascent Capital provides the required information and clarification. If the \ninformation received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  Private sector development. ADB\u2019s investment in AMGF is expected to encourage \ninternational investment and introduction of governance best practices in the fund\u2019s investee \ncompanies, which could potentially help scale-up small and/or medium sized local businesses. \nThe investment may also help catalyze private sector investment in Myanmar by demonstrating \nthe viability of private equity as a financing option in the country where equity capital availability \nis scarce and banks are undercapitalized, which limits their ability to lend to companies that are \nable to pledge collateral.  \n \n24.  Setting standards. As the first development financial institution investor in AMGF, ADB \nwill obligate Ascent Capital to report on gender and development indicators and adopt an \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) acceptable to ADB. Ascent Capital will \nrequire  portfolio  companies  to  operate  in  accordance  with  its  ESMS.  Because  of  ADB\u2019s \ninterventions during the fund\u2019s formation, the proposed AMGF investments will be screened \nagainst a gender equity scorecard, national environmental and social laws, and ADB\u2019s safeguard \nrequirements. In addition, ADB will provide oversight on environmental and social matters, \nincluding gender and labor, as required during investment appraisal. \n \n25.  Long term funding. The fund\u2019s ability to provide long-term, patient equity capital will \nbenefit companies that struggle to scale up because of unavailability of long-term expansion \ncapital. This will help develop Myanmar\u2019s economy and capital markets, which are still at a \nnascent stage of development. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n26.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n \n33.  Impact. The project is aligned with the 12-point Economic Policy of the Union of Myanmar, \nwhich promotes inclusive economic growth, a competitive, vibrant, and market-oriented private \nsector and a financial system that can sustainably provide capital to businesses and SMEs.  \n \n34.  Outcome.  Financial  sustainability  of  private  equity  investments  in  Myanmar  is \ndemonstrated. \n \n35.  Outputs. AMGF is established and investments in 10\u201315 companies are completed, and \na gender inclusive policy is adopted. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n36.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment in AMGF aligns strongly with \nthe operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.12 These include (i) addressing poverty \nand reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all and (ii) \nfostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration by  enhancing  connectivity  and  strengthening \ncooperation  in  the  financial  sector.  Strategy  2030  also  supports  expanding  private  sector \noperations, including expanding regional reach through private equity funds, supporting greater \nfinancial inclusion, strengthening the finance sector in capital markets, and widening geographical \ncoverage. \n \n37.  Consistency with country strategy. The proposed investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017-2021, which focuses on: (i) improving Myanmar\u2019s \naccess  and  connectivity  to  regional  and  global  markets;  and  (ii)  promoting  structural  and \ninstitutional  reform  to  support  the  modernization  of  Myanmar\u2019s  economy.13 ADB\u2019s  country \n \n10  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n11  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]  \n12 ADB. 2018.

Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  proposed \ninvestment is consistent with the ADB plan for financial sector operations, which prioritizes (i) \ninclusive finance for households and SMEs and (ii) regional monetary and financial cooperation \nand integration.14 The plan addresses ADB\u2019s focus on supporting enhanced access to finance, \nincluding through private equity funds, for SMEs. \n \n39.  Lessons from previous operations. While this will be ADB\u2019s first investment in a \nMyanmar-focused private equity fund, lessons learned from previous fund investments were \nconsidered and incorporated into the proposed transaction. A Special Evaluation Study on Private \nEquity Fund (PEF) Operations published in July 2008 concluded that ADB\u2019s screening process \nlacked strategic focus since investments were identified primarily through sponsors approaching \nADB. The proposed transaction was identified through a bottom-up market mapping exercise of \ncarefully assessing the fund manager and confirming the relevant investment and/or operating \nexperiences of the partners in Myanmar. The fund\u2019s strategic focus on sectors and developmental \nindicators were also confirmed to be in line with ADB\u2019s mandate. [This information has been \nremoved as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. \n17.2.(v)].  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n40.  ADB has categorized the investment to be in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009).15 \n \n41.  Category  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  investment's  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts, its risks associated with AMGF\u2019s likely future portfolio and its commitment and capacity \nfor environmental and social management. As a first-time fund manager in Myanmar, Ascent \nCapital had no ESMS before ADB\u2019s proposed investment. During due diligence, ADB provided \nguidance to Ascent Capital in developing its Myanmar-focused ESMS and conducted training to \nstrengthen  the  managing  partners\u2019  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements.  AMGF\u2019s  likely  portfolio  is  not  expected  to  (i)  require  major  infrastructure \ndevelopment or generate significant, adverse, irreversible or diverse environmental and social \nimpacts or risks; and (ii) require involuntary resettlement or adversely or beneficially affect distinct \nand vulnerable ethnic minority communities. The ESMS will exclude the fund from investing in \nany potential investment that may be classified category A for the environment, involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Ascent \nCapital will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using \nADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before \ndisbursement.16 The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national \nlabor laws and measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant \nto ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for \n \n14 ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n15 ADB.

Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), Ascent Capital has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) \nAscent Capital will design and implement an overarching gender policy to guide and manage its \nefforts in achieving gender equality in its investees\u2019 businesses. (ii) Ascent Capital will screen its \npotential investees using a gender equality scorecard to assess their status and responsiveness \nto women\u2019s empowerment in the workplace. (iii) Ascent Capital will establish and maintain a \ngender mainstreaming outreach program to enhance the skills and capacity of business women \nwithin its portfolio companies and the broader community. Ascent Capital will submit periodic \nreports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n43.  Ascent Capital was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC.
