", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \nthe Republic of Kiribati for the Outer Islands Transport Infrastructure Investment Project. \n \n2.  The project will improve the safety and resilience of transport connectivity in the following \nouter islands in the Kiribati\u2019s Gilbert Group of islands: Abaiang, Beru, Nonouti, and Tabiteuea \nSouth.1 The project will (i) improve the safety of interisland navigation by conducting hydrographic \nsurveys  and  producing  nautical  charts;  (ii)  improve  the  resilience  of  outer  island  access \ninfrastructure by providing ship-to-shore navigation aids; building a jetty, boat ramps, shelters, and \nmultipurpose maritime facilities; and rehabilitating island-crossing causeways; and (iii) strengthen \nthe enabling environment for sustainability by providing technical support and training to help build \ngreater institutional  capacity to design, implement, and maintain transport sector investments, \nincluding contingency planning, extreme weather maritime management, and resilient operational \nand maintenance practices. The overall objective is to support the country\u2019s development goals in \nimproving access to economic opportunities and social services, particularly for those living in the \nouter islands. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country context. Kiribati is one of the most remote and geographically dispersed countries \nin the world. It has 33 small islands spread across 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean. About \n55% of Kiribati\u2019s total population of 115,847 live in the main island of Tarawa, which includes the \ncapital, South Tarawa; the remaining inhabitants are spread across the outer islands.2 These are \nlow-lying atolls that are highly exposed to the effects of climate change, including sea level rise \nand more intense rainfall and wind from tropical cyclones.3 Access to goods and services in the \nouter islands is limited. Many inhabitants are moving to the more urban capital, which provides \njobs, access to higher education, and specialized social services. \n \n4.  Safe and resilient transport infrastructure is essential for connecting Kiribati\u2019s population to \neconomic opportunities and social services, particularly for those living in the outer islands. Such \ninfrastructure is also key to achieving the government\u2019s objective to stop migration from the outer \nislands to Tarawa, which is already overcrowded and congested.4 Stopping migration requires \nsubstantive improvements in (i) the safety of interisland maritime navigation; (ii) the resilience of \nouter island access infrastructure; and (iii) the institutional capacity of key government agencies: \nthe Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development (MICTTD); and \nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy (MISE). \n \n5.  Transport sector challenges. The safety of interisland maritime navigation is a major \nconcern because of the lack of nautical charts, which are necessary for safe navigation and for \nprevention of vessel groundings that can result in fatalities and pollution. The government does \nnot have the resources or expertise to carry out the hydrographic surveys required to produce \nnautical charts. The hydrographic surveys provide essential  information to plan and develop \nmaritime infrastructure, such as the configuration of the seafloor, water depths, and the location of \n \n1  Kiribati is made up of three island groups: the Gilbert Group, which includes the main island of Tarawa and the capital, \nSouth Tarawa; the Phoenix Group; and the Line Group. \n2  World Bank Open Data. Kiribati (accessed 7 January 2020). \n3  An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef with a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. \n4  Government of Kiribati. 2015. Kiribati Development Plan 2016\u201319. Tarawa. \n ", "2 \naids to navigation (ATON), which are markers to guide vessels. The lack of hydrographic surveys \nconstrains the development of the outer islands. It restrains private sector investments and tourism \nindustry, disrupts shipping of copra to markets, and causes long periods for resupply of basic \ngoods. \n \n6.  Outer island  access infrastructure is inadequate  and  lacks resilience  in  several key \naspects. ATONs are not designed to withstand harsh conditions. Many need replacement and \nsome are completely missing. The outer islands lack ship-to-shore berthing infrastructure such as \nboat ramps and jetties, and passengers often must wade through several hundred meters of water \nto reach land. Such passage is particularly dangerous for children and the elderly. Degraded \nisland-crossing causeways hinder connectivity and lack climate-resilient features such as proper \ndrainage and erosion control. \n \n7.  The  key government agencies  have inadequate  institutional  capacity for sustainable \ndevelopment and maintenance of transport infrastructure in the outer islands.  The MICTTD\u2019s \nMarine Division regulates domestic and international shipping, provides ATONs, and conducts \nsearch-and-rescue operations.  The MISE\u2019s Civil Engineering  Division handles  land transport \ninfrastructure development and maintenance and coastal protection. Both divisions are under-\nresourced and lack capacity. There is no systematic approach to maritime sector development, \nsuch as an overall road map and medium- and long-term investment plans. \n \n8.  Climate change and disaster resilience. An atoll nation, Kiribati is low-lying and highly \nvulnerable to climate change and disaster risks. Climatic conditions and the impacts of wind and \nwaves have contributed to the growing strain on shipping  operations. In particular, improved \nmaritime infrastructure must account for the seasonal wave climate. Since 2008, several severe \nevents have impacted Kiribati, including two major ferry accidents caused by rough seas (2009 and \n2018); tropical cyclones (2015 and 2016); extreme tides (2010, 2014, and 2015); and large swells \nbecause of strong winds (2008). Climate change could worsen the wave climate. Safety is a \nconcern during the northern trade wind season (December\u2013March), when waves are higher and \nlast longer than in other months. Aside from safety concerns, surface wind-generated waves can \nimpact maritime infrastructure in many ways, including through coastal flooding during storm wave \nevents, coastal erosion because of episodic storm events and long-term changes in integrated \nwave climate, and reef morphology. \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has conducted an initial disaster and climate risk \nassessment, which highlights the project\u2019s intent to mitigate disaster and climate change risks.5 \nFollowing the hydrographic surveys (para. 16), ADB will develop a more detailed assessment and \na detailed design of maritime infrastructure to ensure that project disaster risks are fully assessed, \ndisaster risk reduction measures identified and costed, and best practices in building climate and \ndisaster resilience reflected in the final design. \n \n10.  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts. Currently, Kiribati has no confirmed case of \nCOVID-19. The project will ensure that contractors are prepared to mitigate potential COVID-19-\nrelated risks associated with the movement of labor, materials, and equipment. The impact of the \nproposed project will contribute positively to the government\u2019s effort to secure safe movement of \ncritical supplies and people between Tarawa and the outer islands. Transport connectivity is key \nfor trade, and maritime infrastructure supported under this project will not only improve maritime \nsafety but also boost economic activity. \n \n \n5  Disaster and Climate Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n11.  Alignment with strategic priorities. The project is in line with the Kiribati 20-Year Vision, \n2016\u20132036,6 which sets the country\u2019s development goals and long-term planning framework. The \nvision\u2019s overall objective is to \u201cbolster national efforts in transforming the lives of an I-Kiribati and \neconomy into a resilient, wealthy, healthy and secure nation.\u201d7 The project is consistent with the \nADB Strategy  2030  priority  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity, particularly  in  small  island \ndeveloping countries.8 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach in reducing costs \nby improving domestic and regional connectivity through transport infrastructure, managing risks, \nand enabling value creation; and in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals.9 The project is \nincluded  in ADB\u2019s country operations  business  plan, 2020\u20132022  for 11 small Pacific island \ncountries.10 \n \n12.  Lessons. Kiribati\u2019s remoteness has a significant and often unpredictable impact on costs. \nThe difference between the cost estimate at appraisal and the actual contract price can be largely \nattributed to the absence of detailed designs. The project is learning from this and applied a 20%\u2013\n30% contingency (25% average physical contingency) to all estimated civil works, and a buffer in \nthe estimated time lines to factor unforeseen delays. \n \n13.  Experience in ADB\u2019s Kiribati operations shows that intensive implementation support will \nbe required throughout the project. It will establish an outer islands implementation unit (OIIU) and \nsupport the Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU).11 The project will build the institutional capacity \nof agencies throughout project implementation and hold regular videoconferences with the OIIU, \nthe KFSU, and implementing agency focal points as needed. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: improved access to economic and social \ninfrastructure in the outer islands  (footnote 6). The project will have the following outcome: \nimproved safety and resilience of transport connectivity in Abaiang, Beru, Nonouti, and Tabiteuea \nSouth.12 \n  \n15.  The government prioritized the four islands because either they have no infrastructure or, \nif they do, it is more dilapidated than that of other outer islands.13 The project will be cofinanced \nby ADB and the World Bank to achieve the following outputs: \n \n16.  Output  1:  Safety  of  interisland  navigation  improved.  The  project  will  produce \nhydrographic surveys and nautical  charts for the  four target islands  to significantly improve \nnavigation safety. The output will inform the design of the project-financed maritime works and \nenable investments in developing other maritime infrastructure. The hydrographic surveys will lead \nto more climate-resilient spatial planning by establishing a detailed baseline to monitor the impacts \nof climate change on marine resources, reefs, and the coastline. \n \n6  Government of Kiribati. 2015.

Output 2: Resilience of outer island access infrastructure improved. The project will \n(i) improve ship-to-shore navigation safety by replacing defective ATONs, fabricating and installing \nnew  ATONs,  and  establishing  a  system  of  maintenance;  (ii)  rehabilitate  island  access \ninfrastructure to meet the needs of women, minors, and older people by constructing jetties, \nconcrete boat ramps, and shelters; and (iii) improve intraisland connectivity by providing technical \nsupport for building multipurpose maritime facilities and rehabilitating island-crossing causeways. \nResilient  design measures and construction materials will be used to increase  infrastructure \nresilience to extreme tides, storm surge, and other identified disaster risks. \n \n18.  Output 3: Enabling  environment strengthened. The project  will (i) strengthen  the \nMICTTD\u2019s and the MISE\u2019s institutional and regulatory functions for transport by providing technical \nsupport and training to improve the ministries\u2019 skills in managing transport infrastructure to be built \nunder the project; and (ii) identify and prepare priority maritime projects for investment. The output \nwill  help  build  greater  institutional  capacity  to  design,  implement,  and  maintain  transport \ninvestments.  Capacity building  will include  contingency planning,  extreme weather maritime \nmanagement, and resilient operation and maintenance practices. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  ADB has extensive experience in tackling the needs  and challenges of the Pacific\u2019s \ntransport, and the proposed engagement in Kiribati\u2019s maritime transport will help build capacity in \ngovernment agencies. The project will provide a natural platform for sector-related development \npartner coordination among the government, ADB, and other development partners. Support for \ngender  equality and women\u2019s empowerment is central to the  2030 Agenda  for Sustainable \nDevelopment.14 The project will consider the project area\u2019s gender issues, such as accessibility to \npublic services by women and extremely high rates of gender-based violence (GBV), and will \npropose actions to promote gender equality. \n \n20.  The project continues ADB\u2013World Bank cooperation in Kiribati, which began in 2010, when \nthe Kiribati Road Rehabilitation Project was approved; in 2017, it was successfully implemented.15 \nThe approach adopted by both cofinanciers has laid the groundwork for the proposed project. \nCofinancing is a useful way to lower the risk from the government\u2019s inadequate implementation \ncapacity by reducing the workload, avoiding burdensome duplicated procedures, and shortening \nprocessing times. ADB\u2019s significant contributions to the project, including  project preparation \ntechnical assistance to ensure high project readiness, supplemented and/or complemented the \nWorld Bank\u2019s services.16 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is  estimated to  cost $42.0  million  (Table 1). Detailed  cost estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).17 \n \n22.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $12.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. \n \n14 United Nations. 2015.

The amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost. No government counterpart \nfunding is budgeted for this project, but the government will cover all other costs not financed by ADB and the World \nBank, including land acquisition and resettlement costs. \nb  As of February 2020. \nc  Physical and price contingencies of 2.4% for domestic inflation and 1.6% for international inflation, and a provision for \nexchange rate fluctuation are included. \nSources: ADB and World Bank estimates. \n \n23.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures relating to the \ncontracts for the hydrographic surveys, ATONs, maritime infrastructure, and capacity-building \nprograms for the MICTTD and the MISE. The World Bank will provide grant financing equivalent \nto $30.0 million, which will jointly back all ADB-financed contracts and other contracts not financed \nby ADB to rehabilitate island-crossing causeways, provide operational support to KFSU, and the \ncontingent emergency response component.18 \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF grant)  10.01  23.8 \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF DRR Financing)  1.99  4.8 \nThe World Bank (International Development Association grant)  30.00  71.4 \nTotal  42.00  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund; DRR = disaster risk reduction. \nSources: ADB and World Bank estimates. \n \n24.  Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $11.48 million. ADB will finance 37.89% ($4.35 \nmillion) of adaptation costs. Disaster risk reduction measures to increase the disaster resilience of \nmaritime infrastructure and causeways (output 2) and strengthen institutional capacity for more \nresilient outcomes (output 3) to be financed by ADB are estimated at $2.43 million (footnote 5), of \nwhich $2.0 million will be covered by the Asian Development Fund disaster risk reduction financing \nmechanism. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) will be the executing agency. \nThe MICTTD will be the implementing agency for the maritime components, and the MISE for the \nland transport components. The project will establish the OIIU, to be housed under the MFED, to \n \n18 The contingent emergency response component is the World Bank\u2019s contingent financing mechanism available to \ngain rapid access to financing to respond to a crisis or emergency and provides the immediate rehabilitation or \nreconstruction needs without needing to first restructure the original project. \n ", "6 \nsupport the MICTTD and the MISE in managing the project. The OIIU is expected to rely on the \nKFSU for procurement and  financial support.  Under  the  MFED\u2019s oversight,  the  KFSU has \nsupported ADB- and World Bank\u2013financed projects on procurement, financial management, and \noverall coordination. Several positions within the KFSU were recruited through such projects. \n \n26.  As the project includes lead cofinancing from the World Bank, it will follow ADB\u2019s alternative \nprocurement arrangements detailed in the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time), and universal procurement will apply.19 Following the procurement framework agreement \nbetween ADB and the World Bank dated 3 December 2018, a project implementation agreement \nwill be signed under which the World Bank will be designated as the lead cofinancier for all \nprocurement-related  activities  under  the  project. 20 This  means  that  World  Bank  policies, \nregulations, rules, and instructions will apply to the procurement of all goods, works, and services \nunder the project. The World Bank will provide implementation support and monitor procurement \nactivities. It will report to ADB as required by the procurement framework agreement and project \nimplementation agreement. \n \n27.  Since ADB and the World Bank will be jointly financing selected procurement contracts \nunder the project, the debarment lists of ADB and the World Bank will need to apply to the project\u2019s \njointly financed contracts. The agreement for mutual enforcement of debarment decisions dated 9 \nApril 2010 between ADB and other multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, \nenables ADB to cross-debar entities debarred by other multilateral development banks. However, \nonly debarments that meet certain conditions\u2014e.g., when the period of debarment is more than 1 \nyear\u2014are eligible for cross-debarment. As the World Bank has debarred entities that ADB has not, \napproval by the ADB Board of Directors is sought to apply the World Bank\u2019s debarment list, in \naddition to ADB\u2019s debarment list, to jointly financed contracts under the project. \n \n28.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  The maritime infrastructure improvements proposed under the project are simple, low- \nmaintenance structures compatible with local infrastructure maintenance capacity. These include \nsmall passenger terminals in each of the four project islands, a jetty, small-scale dredging, and \nramps for small boat retrieval. If designed and built properly, the infrastructure will be robust and \ndurable, and the structures require minimal maintenance once they are handed over to the island \ncouncils. The structures risk being directly impacted by the effects of climate change, such as \nflooding inundation, more frequent and intense high tides, extreme storms, overtopping and storm \nsurge, and more frequent and intense coastal erosion and sedimentation. These risks will be \nincorporated into the design during the detailed design phase of the works. \n \n30.  Technical due diligence aims to increase resilience to disasters and climate change. If a \ndisaster were to occur under current conditions, foreign aid vessels would not be able to reach the \nshores of the outer islands because the lagoons are unsafe to navigate. Producing nautical charts \nand upgrading ATONs will resolve this issue and make the outer island lagoons navigable. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n31.  Economic viability. The nature of the proposed activities varies. Hydrographic surveys, \nfor example, are essential for establishing digital chart coverage of the outer islands to make \nnavigation safer, but they do not lead to additional income or direct reduction in operating costs. \nThese small-scale maritime interventions are needed to improve the delivery of basic goods and \nservices. Because of this variation, the standard demand analysis for calculating economic viability \nis not applicable for all project components. The economic analysis was carried out using least-\ncost analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, or cost\u2013benefit analysis for individual components, \ndepending on whether their benefits were quantifiable. The hydrographic surveys and the maritime \ninfrastructure components used the cost-effectiveness analysis, which suggested airborne surveys \nas the most cost-effective hydrographic survey method. For maritime infrastructure, the analysis \nsuggested as the most cost-effective interventions a new ramp, shelter, and on-ramp pontoon in \nAbaiang; the dredging of an approach channel and turning basin in Beru; and new shelters, ATON \nworkshops and winches, and maintenance and storage of small boats in Nonouti and Tabiteuea \nSouth. The rehabilitation of island-crossing causeways used the cost\u2013benefit analysis because \nuser costs and benefits could be quantified as vehicle operating and travel time cost savings. The \n11 causeways to be rehabilitated are unsealed and carry about 445 vehicles per day, mostly \nmotorcycles (94%) and small trucks. Owned by island councils or private owners, the trucks mainly \ntransport students to and from school, and are hired to transport coconuts, wood, gravel, or sand, \nand to deliver cargo from landing sites and airports to villages. The motorcycles are mainly for \nwork-related trips and small-scale cargo movements. The estimated average daily traffic growth is \n ", "8 \n2.0% per year for all vehicles. The analysis suggests that the proposed interventions for island-\ncrossing causeways are economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 10.9%.21 \n \n32.  Financial  sustainability.  The  additional  budget  for  sustainably  maintaining  the \ninfrastructure built under the project will be 1%\u20137% of the annual recurrent budgets of the MICTTD \nand  the  MISE. Capacity and  allocation  for maintenance are  insufficient, which will  pose  a \nsubstantial risk to the financial sustainability of the investments and assets built under the project. \nThe project will include a capacity-building component to enable the MISE and the island council \nresponsible for maintenance to establish maintenance competence in the outer islands. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n33.  The project will help reform the way that maintenance is financed and programmed for the \nasset types (i.e., ATONs, island access infrastructure, causeways) improved by the project. For \nresilient outer island access infrastructure, the project will provide (i) on-the-job training to unskilled \nworkers recruited to carry out rehabilitation works and routine maintenance; and (ii) training to the \nMISE and island council personnel on inspection and reporting, identification of maintenance \nneeds,  and  physical  delivery of routine  maintenance  activities.  The  design  of all  maritime \ninfrastructure installed will be informed by current projections of how climate change may impact \nthe asset\u2019s sustainability. \n \n34.  An asset management information system is being implemented by the MFED to cover all \ngovernment assets, including facilities proposed by the project, to support the sustainability and \nmaintenance of assets after project completion. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n35.  The  financial management assessment  conducted in  November 2019  followed ADB \nguidelines in the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial Due Diligence: \nA  Methodology  Note. 22  The  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  including  fund-flow arrangements,  staffing, accounting  and financial \nreporting systems, budgeting, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessed pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because of (i) inadequate attention to \nrepairs and maintenance, which will undermine the sustainability of investments; (ii) delays in \ncompliance with financial management reporting requirements; (iii) delays in processing claims for \ndisbursements because of the KFSU\u2019s inadequate staff and financial resources; and (iv) the \nabsence of internal audit. The MFED, the MICTTD, and the MISE have agreed to implement a \nfinancial management action plan (in the PAM) to resolve the deficiencies. \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the MFED. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, and two of the three outputs \nhave gender indicators. A gender analysis undertaken as part of project preparation found that (i) \n \n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A \nMethodology Note. Manila. \n ", "9 \nwomen in  the  outer  islands  have  limited  or  no  access  to  services  and  economic growth \nopportunities;  (ii) boat travel between islands is unreliable and considered unsafe for women, \nchildren, people with disability, and older people; (iii) women in the outer islands face barriers to \nworking in nontraditional sectors such as construction; and (iv) GBV rates in Kiribati are more than \ntwice the global average, with 68% of women aged 15\u201349 who had ever been in a relationship \ndisclosing they had experienced some form of GBV from an intimate partner. The gender action \nplan will (i) improve women\u2019s access to services and economic opportunities in the outer islands, \nand (ii) promote safe job and professional development for women in the transport sector. The \nproject was screened using the World Bank\u2019s GBV risk assessment tool and was classified as \nhaving moderate risk. Considering the moderate risk category and the high underlying rates of \nGBV and violence against children in Pacific island countries, the project will develop a GBV \nframework and undertake several activities to prevent and respond to GBV. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n39.  Environment (category B). ADB and the World Bank have agreed on a common approach \nto safeguards to ensure compliance with their policies and country safeguards. The project will \nhave site-specific impacts and few, if any, are irreversible. However, mitigation and management \nmeasures can be readily designed and implemented for most impacts. Following the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, an environmental and social management framework for the overall project and \nan environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for selected components have been \nprepared. The ESIA is equivalent to an initial  environmental examination that is required for \ncategory B  projects.  The  impacts are  limited  to  the  footprint of small-scale  land  maritime \ninfrastructure in the outer islands (including ATONs, a jetty, passenger terminals, concrete boat \nramps, and shelters, and the rehabilitation of island-crossing causeways), and can be mitigated \nand managed to acceptable levels, provided the measures in  the environmental and social \nmanagement plan (ESMP) are implemented, monitored, and reported. Short-term impacts are \nanticipated  during  construction, including  dust,  noise,  and waste generated  during  dredging \nexcavation and civil works activities, as well as minor community and occupational health and \nsafety risks. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, the environmental and social \nmanagement framework, the ESIA and subsequent ESIA, and monitoring reports will be disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. The contractors will prepare their ESMP based on the ESIA and/or the ESMP. \nThe MICTTD and the MISE, with support from the design and supervision consultants will review \nand clear the contractors\u2019 ESMPs, monitor the contractors\u2019 compliance with their ESMPs, and \nmonitor the ESMPs\u2019 effectiveness. \n \n40.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Due diligence confirmed that the project will not \nhave significant involuntary resettlement impacts and is not expected to cause any physical \ndisplacement and loss of livelihood. Most impacts are associated with resilient outer island access \ninfrastructure from the loss of coconut trees and the requirement for new land lease for selected \nmaritime facilities (component 2). The MICTTD and the MISE, with support from the design and \nsupervision consultants, will carry out further investigation when the island access infrastructure is \ndesigned during project implementation. Island access infrastructure-related works and facilities \nare expected to use mostly government-leased land. Voluntary lease agreements will be pursued \nfor long-term land use as needed, such as with the proposed boat ramp and shelter at Buariki in \nTabiteuea South, and the passenger shelter at Tebikeriki in Beru. Minor impacts expected from \n \n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "10 \nthese proposed sites are the loss of about 12 coconut trees and one toilet structure on government-\nowned  land.  The rehabilitation  of the  causeways has  been assessed  as unlikely  to cause \nresettlement impacts as they are unoccupied. Civil works are also not expected to alter the footprint \nof the causeways and approach roads. Improving ship-to-shore transfers (maritime ATONs) is not \nexpected to have any involuntary resettlement impacts. The MICTTD and the MISE have prepared \na draft resettlement framework consistent with the Safeguard Policy Statement and World Bank \nrequirements to guide the preparation of the resettlement plan and/or due diligence report for the \nmaritime navigation aids, following the findings of the hydrographic surveys.24 The MICTTD and \nthe MISE, with support from the consultants prepared a draft resettlement plan for the rest of the \nproject components subject to further updates following the detailed design.25 The MICTTD and \nthe MISE consulted the affected persons  and disclosed draft safeguard documents, and will \ncontinue consultations during project implementation. \n \n41.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The I-Kiribati comprise a single indigenous  ethnic \ngroup and the project beneficiaries are not considered distinct and vulnerable. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPolitical and governance risk because of  The project will clearly define responsibilities of all government agencies \nthe lack or high turnover of ministry  including the MFED, the MICTTD, and the MISE.
