It is part \nof long-standing assistance provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The program builds \non progress under previous policy-based programs and technical assistance (TA) to improve the \nmanagement of public expenditure and assets, and the governance of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs).2  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  priority  of  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nEconomic  development  challenges.  Nauru  is  a  Pacific  microstate.  Its  population  of \nabout  13,000 is  concentrated  along  the  narrow  coastal  belt  of  its  single  21-square  kilometer \nisland. Small size and remoteness raise the cost of providing public infrastructure and services \nwhile  limiting  competitiveness  and  economies  of  scale.  The  government  and  SOEs  dominate \neconomic  activity  and  employment,  with  SOEs  alone  creating  about  half  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) and one third of formal sector jobs. Nauru reported double-digit economic growth \nfrom  2010  to  2014,  but  this  has  slowed  since  with  (i)  a  scaling  down  of  the  operations  of  the \nAustralian-funded  Regional  Processing  Centre  (RPC)  for  asylum  seekers;  and  (ii)  falling \nphosphate  exports,  as  the  primary  deposits  of  the  island\u2019s  main  resource  near  depletion.  The \nscope for economic diversification, private investment, and job creation is limited; and the levels \nof  social  vulnerability,  inequality,  and  noncommunicable  disease  are  high.4  Women  held  only \n10.5% of seats in the national parliament in 2019. \n \n4. \nCOVID-19  impacts.  Nauru\u2019s  economy  is  affected  by  trade  and  travel  disruptions \nstemming  from  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.5  Construction  of  infrastructure \nprojects, which rely on imports and foreign workers, will slow. This will have follow-on impacts to \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2016.

Economic contraction of 1.7% is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in \nFY2020 followed by a recovery in FY2021 (Table 1). A slowdown in government revenue and an \nincrease in spending is expected to erode the fiscal balance in FY2020. The government\u2019s initial \nfiscal  response to  COVID-19  has  included  reprioritizing  public  expenditure  towards  health  and \ncontainment  efforts  and  providing  liquidity  support  to  SOEs  to  ensure  critical  services  are \nmaintained. Improved public expenditure management and governance of SOEs would help the \ngovernment to confront rising fiscal risks related with COVID-19.    \n \n\nTable 1: Macro-Fiscal Performance and Outlook, FY2016\u2013FY2021 \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \n\nFY2016  FY2017  FY2018e  FY2019e \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFY2020p  FY2021p \n \n \n\nItem \nGrowth and Inflation \nReal GDP growth (% \nchange) \nConsumer prices (% \nchange) \nGovernment Finance \nTotal revenue and grants \n\nRevenue \nGrants \n\nTotal expenditure \nOverall balance \n\n    Including government \nNTF contributions \n\nNTF \nNTF stock \nDebt \nDomestic debt \nExternal debt \n\n3.0 \n\n8.2 \n\n \n114.9 \n91.6 \n23.3 \n93.4 \n21.4 \n\n6.6 \n\n \n24.6 \n \n45.5 \n34.0 \n\n(5.5) \n\n5.1 \n\n \n121.8 \n100.6 \n21.3 \n100.5 \n21.4 \n \n13.2 \n \n \n39.1 \n \n43.1 \n33.6 \n\n5.7 \n\n0.5 \n\n \n129.3 \n108.5 \n20.8 \n96.8 \n32.5 \n\n23.2 \n\n \n52.8 \n \n43.7 \n30.6 \n\n1.0 \n\n3.9 \n\n \n141.6 \n126.6 \n15.1 \n125.6 \n16.1 \n\n \n63.6 \n \n33.5 \n28.7 \n\n(1.7) \n\n1.5  \n\n \n141.1 \n120.7 \n20.4 \n141.1 \n0.0 \n\n \n77.5 \n \n31.3 \n29.5 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.7 \n\n \n106.4 \n90.6 \n15.8 \n102.1 \n4.3 \n\n \n89.7 \n \n29.8 \n29.2 \n\n7.3 \n\n(10.3) \n\n(6.9) \n\n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nNTF = Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund, p = projection. \nSources: ADB estimates; Government of Nauru Budget Documents; International Monetary Fund.   \n\n \n5. \nFiscal performance. Government domestic revenue increased fivefold from FY2012 to \nFY2019 because of the reopening of the RPC, improved fishing license receipts under a regional \narrangement, and increased tax collection.6 The government has used recent fiscal surpluses to \nadd to the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund (NTF) and reduce arrears. Fiscal surpluses have \nalso enabled the government to build its cash buffer, resulting in government deposits equivalent \nto more than 2 months of non-RPC spending since August 2017, as recommended by the IMF.7 \nLimited access to credit markets and a vulnerability to economic shocks make it critical for Nauru \nto  maintain  adequate  cash  buffers  (in  addition  to  the  NTF)  to  protect  budget  stability.  If,  as \nexpected,  RPC  activity  and  the  revenue  this  generates  for  the  government  decline  over  the \nmedium-term,  the  IMF  projects that  fiscal  spending  would  have  to  adjust  to maintain  sufficient \ncash buffers and contributions to the NTF.8 To maintain budget stability and to help put public \ndebt  on  a  sustainable  path,  the  government  needs  to  improve  the  management  of  its  public \ninvestments.  \n\n \n\n6 \n\nIn  nominal  terms.

Republic of Nauru 2019 Article IV Consultation\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the \nExecutive Director for the Republic of Nauru. IMF Country Report No. 20/31. Washington, DC \n\n\f3 \n\n \n6. \nPublic  sector  debt  and  state-owned  enterprises.  The  IMF  reports  that  total  public \nsector  debt,  including  SOE  debt,  equaled  86.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2018  and  is  considered \nunsustainable. This is higher than the level reported in the 2017 Article IV staff report because of \nthe inclusion of some existing SOE debt and legacy debt pending resolution, and a new loan for \nphosphate mining. In addition, weak governance and monitoring have prevented Nauru\u2019s SOEs \nfrom operating on strict commercial principles. Unfinanced directives to deliver community service \nobligations  distort  SOE  financial  performance  incentives.9  SOE  subsidies and  equity  injections \ntotaled about 13.4% of Nauru\u2019s public expenditure during the two years FY2019\u2013FY2020, yet few \nSOEs  keep  up-to-date  financial  information.  The  absence  of  a  central  unit  to  monitor  the \nperformance  of  the  SOE  portfolio  limited  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  ensure  that  they  are  run \nefficiently and in the best interest of the people of Nauru. Lacking a precise mandate, some SOEs \ncompete with private companies, making it difficult for the private sector to grow in Nauru\u2019s small \nmarket.  The  IMF  has  indicated  that  delays  in  implementing  SOE  reforms  would  lower  growth \nprospects and jeopardize fiscal sustainability (footnote 8). The program will help address the risks \nposed by SOE debt by establishing directors\u2019 obligations relating to public enterprise debt under \nthe Public Enterprise Act, 2019; and creating a public enterprise monitoring unit with responsibility \nto advise the government on public enterprise loans and contingent liabilities, among other SOE \nissues. A measure to improve public debt reporting by the Department of Finance (DOF) is also \nincluded in the post-program partnership framework (PPPF). \n \n7. \nPublic  expenditure  management  weaknesses.  While  a  solid  legislative  framework \nexisted in the Public Finance Act, 1997, the absence of adequate financial instructions meant that \nthe responsibilities of delegated officers were unclear and fragmented. Unutilized modules of the \ngovernment\u2019s financial management information system (FMIS) further undermined expenditure \nmanagement.  The  public  could  not  easily  access  budget  documents,  which  limited  the \ntransparency of public expenditure and debt. Combined with the effects of Nauru\u2019s geographic \nisolation, continued weaknesses in public procurement often resulted in high unit costs for, and \nsupply shortages of, publicly procured goods. \n \nPublic  asset  management  weaknesses.  Efficient  management  of  assets  has  been  a \n8. \ngrowing  challenge \ninvestments  by \ndevelopment partners and those made in connection with the RPC since 2012, as well as aging \ninfrastructure  assets  in  other  sectors.  Government  departments  generally  lacked  data  on  the \ncondition and maintenance requirements of their assets to inform sound budget planning. This, \ncombined  with  low  institutional  capacity  for  asset  management,  contributed  to  weak  budget \nplanning and maintenance spending. To build a sustainable future, Nauru needs to manage its \npublic investments more effectively to ensure better value for money and better delivery of public \nservices. \n \nPast ADB engagement. ADB has addressed Nauru\u2019s development financing needs and \n9. \ncreated incentives for reform through two policy-based programs, which were supported by TA to \nbuild  government  capacity  to  meet  agreed  policy  actions.10  The  2012  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program,  ADB\u2019s  first  policy-based  program  in  the  country,  provided \n\nthe  government,  given  significant \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfor \n\n \n\n9  ADB.

ADB\u2019s previous policy-based grants have financed stand-alone operations that \n10. \nsequenced reforms to build on past achievements. Ongoing support in these reform areas was \nprovided through TA. The program completion reports recommended that ADB\u2019s focus on public \nfinancial management, asset management, the NTF, and SOE performance should continue in \nfuture operations (footnote 14). The program will do so while addressing the risks posed by SOE \ndebt\u2014a remaining weakness (para. 6). While previous policy-based programs have supported \nthe adoption of a debt management strategy and corporate governance reforms at select SOEs, \nthe  program  will  establish  clear  responsibilities  relating  to  debt  across  the  SOE  portfolio  by \nestablishing an overarching legal and monitoring framework. The program will also incorporate \nlessons during the first two policy-based programs by recognizing that (i) policy-based programs \ncan  achieve  results  when  country  ownership  is  strong,  (ii)  strong  technical  analysis  can  help \nensure that a government will continue to view policy actions as appropriate even after the political \nand economic context changes, (iii) coordinated development partner TA support can help the \ngovernment  follow  through  on  policy  actions  when  local  institutional  capacity  is  low,  and  (iv)  a \ntight focus on a limited set of policy actions can help ensure that reforms are delivered within the \nenvisaged time frame. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nGovernment strategy. Nauru\u2019s development vision, adopted in 2005, is \u201ca future where \nindividual, community, business, and government partnerships contribute to a sustainable quality \nof  life for  all  Nauruans.\u201d15 The  Nauru  Sustainable  Development  Strategy  2019-2030  translates \nthis  vision  into  seven  development  goals,  two  of  which  are  relevant  for  the  program:  (i)  the \ndevelopment  of  stable,  trustworthy,  fiscally  responsible  government;  and  (ii)  the  provision  of \nenhanced  social,  infrastructure,  and  utility  services.

ADB proposes a stand-alone policy-based program that improves \nthe  policy  and  institutional  environment  to  enable  higher  returns  to  Nauru\u2019s  public  investment. \nWhile the program supports critical reforms needed to address Nauru\u2019s development constraints, \npolicy dialogue has shown that several follow-up steps will be crucial when the program ends. \nThe  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  PPPF,  which  will  ensure  that  recently  approved \npolicy decisions and legislative changes are fully implemented, and that support will be there for \nthe next phase of associated reforms.16 A follow-on program is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, but discussions are ongoing to determine which modality will be most appropriate \nto support the next phase of reforms.17 ADB is also considering support through its COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option to help counter the macroeconomic and health impacts of COVID-\n19 in Nauru. The stand-alone modality is considered appropriate for the current program because \nof  (i)  the  success  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  and  Fiscal \nSustainability Reform Program, which also employed this modality; (ii) lessons from prior ADB-\nfinanced programs to avoid complexity and ensure a tight focus on a limited set of policy actions; \n(iii) the need to leverage support for reform in a targeted manner in fragile and conflict-affected \nenvironments;  and  (iv)  the  current  uncertainties  regarding  the  most  appropriate  modality  to \nsupport the next phase of Nauru\u2019s reforms. \n \n13. \nProgram alignment. ADB and the government agreed to focus reform efforts under the \nprogram in three areas critical to addressing Nauru\u2019s development challenges and objective of a \nsustainable quality of life: (i) public expenditure management, (ii) public asset management, and \n(iii) the governance of SOEs. The eight prior actions to be accomplished before program grant \neffectiveness are outlined below and set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The program is \naligned with IMF policy advice (footnote 8); ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach for 2016\u20132020, including its \nthree-pronged  strategy  to  reduce  costs,  manage  risks,  and  enable  value  creation;18  and  three \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to address poverty and inequality (through better \nmanagement  of  the  public  investments  needed  for  equitable  delivery  of  public  services),  to \naccelerate  progress  in  gender  equality  (by  incorporating  gender  provisions  in  public  asset \nmanagement  and  the  governance  of  SOEs),  and  to  strengthen  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity. The program is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 requirement for a differentiated \napproach by ADB to focus on institutional strengthening in fragile and conflict-affected situations \nand to help small island developing states manage financial and economic risks, and reform SOEs \n(footnote 3). \n \n14. \nReform area 1: Public expenditure management improved. Policy actions under this \nreform area focus on strengthening budget control, reporting, and transparency; saving windfall \nrevenue  in  the  NTF  to  finance  future  development  needs;  and  assessing  the  remaining \nweaknesses  in  public  procurement.  These  actions  will  help  Nauru  sustain  a  responsible  fiscal \nposition, promote the strategic allocation of resources, and provide confidence to development \npartners to continue their ongoing support: \n \n\n \n\n16  The  PPPF  has  been  used  successfully  in  other  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  providing  a  platform  for \nongoing  policy  dialogue  in  years  when  ADB  does  not  provide  policy  financing  and  guiding  the  focus  of  any \nsubsequent program.

As a prior action, the secretary of \nfinance  issued  new  financial  instructions  on  general  principles,  payments,  and \nbudget in October 2018, which outline the responsibilities of delegated officers to \nensure that financial transactions are properly managed, controlled, recorded, and \nreported,  consistent  with  Nauru\u2019s  legislative  framework  for  public  finances;  the \ngeneral  ledger  and  accounts  receivable  functions  of  the  FMIS  were  made  fully \nfunctional; and audited financial statements for FY2015 and FY2016, the annual \nand quarterly budget documents for FY2018 and FY2019, and the quarterly budget \nperformance  reports  for  FY2019  were  published  on  the  government  website. \nProviding  the  public  with  easy  access  to  information  on  government  revenues, \nexpenditure,  and  debt  is  a  critical  step  in  building  public  accountability  and \ntransparency. \nNauru  Intergenerational  Trust  Fund.  ADB\u2019s  Fiscal  Sustainability  Reform \nProgram  and  TA  supported  the  establishment  of  the  NTF  in  FY2016  as  a \nmechanism  for  saving  windfall  revenue  and  funding  future  service  delivery \n(para. 9).19 Government contributions are guided by a set of targeted contribution \nranges  that  specify  the  percentage  of  domestic  revenue  to  be  deposited  by  the \ngovernment each year, with the rate rising progressively.20 As a prior action and in \nline  with  its  targeted  contribution,  the  government  maintained  its  commitment \ntoward the NTF by depositing an amount equivalent to 10.1% of FY2018 revenue \n(excluding  pass-through  RPC-related  revenue)  in  the  NTF  for  FY2019.21  In \naddition,  the  government  used  windfall  revenue  in  FY2019  to  make  an  early \ndeposit of $1.4 million toward the following FY2020 targeted contribution.  \nPublic procurement. While Nauru had outsourced major government and SOE \nprocurement, weaknesses remained that reduced the quality and value for money \nof  Nauru\u2019s  public  services.22  To  address  the  remaining  deficiencies,  the \ngovernment requested a review of public sector and SOE procurement practices, \nfor which ADB provided TA support. As a prior action, in June 2019, the cabinet \nconsidered the outcome of this review and approved its proposed reform options \nto strengthen public procurement. The government has since amended the Public \nFinance  Act  to  enable  SOEs  to  be  engaged  in  procurement.  Improving \nprocurement planning will be a critical next step and is included in the PPPF. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n15. \nReform area 2: Public asset management improved. Policy actions under this reform \narea aim to improve the balance between the government\u2019s capital investments in infrastructure \nand its spending to maintain them. The cabinet approved an infrastructure asset management \npolicy in 2017. To provide a framework for affordable asset management, the policy called for the \ndevelopment of an integrated infrastructure asset management plan, which has been supported \nunder this program. \n \n\n(i) \n\nAsset  register.  As  a  prior  action,  the  government  established  a  central  asset \nregister to reflect the  assets\u2019  condition,  location,  and financial  information\u2014data \nthat  was  generally  not  available  previously,  except  for  the  Nauru  Utilities \nCorporation.  The  register,  which  has  been  operational  since  June  2019,  covers \n\n \n\n19  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (Phase 2). Manila. \n20  After the build-up phase, which is prospectively set to FY2033, the NTF will enter a distribution phase. The NTF \ncommittee will determine when the distribution phase is to begin based on the ability of the NTF to provide a material \namount of budget financing in perpetuity.  \n\n21  This was equivalent to $10.4 million. \n22  The government\u2019s procurement policy required the outsourcing of government and SOE procurement greater than \n\n$3,521 (A$5,000 equivalent, excluding bulk fuel procurement) to an independent procurement agent.   \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n7 \n\ngovernment  assets  (including  buildings,  roads,  water  and  sanitation  systems, \ncoastal protection, and vehicles) with a replacement cost of $25,000 or more.23 \nIntegrated infrastructure strategic plan. As a prior action, the cabinet approved \nthe adoption and implementation of the Nauru Integrated Infrastructure Strategic \nPlan  in  November  2019.  This  plan  uses  information  from  the  asset  register  and \napplies economic and social criteria, including a gender-specific provision relating \nto  the  employment  prospects  an  investment  would  generate  for  women,  and  a \nclimate change and disaster risk vulnerability provision, to provide a framework to \nidentify and prioritize rehabilitation works, upgrades, and new capital investments \nfor the next 5 years from 2019.24 It also estimates the annual maintenance budget \nrequired to maintain both current assets and priority infrastructure projects.  \n\n \nReform area 3: Governance of state-owned enterprises enhanced. The intent of the \n16. \nprogram\u2019s  SOE  governance  policy  actions  is  to  overhaul  the  current  policy  and  legislative \nframework and introduce centralized monitoring of SOE performance across all sectors. \n \n\nState-owned  enterprise  policy.  As  a  prior  action,  the  cabinet  approved  a \ncommercially  oriented  SOE  policy  in  November  2018.  The  policy  outlines  the \nrationale for government ownership of SOEs and establishes principles to guide \nSOE reforms.  \nPublic  enterprise  bill.  As  a  prior  action,  in  June  2019,  the  cabinet  approved  a \npublic enterprise bill for submission to Parliament, based on the new SOE policy. \nThis bill, which was subsequently enacted by Parliament, creates the legislative \nframework for SOEs to be commercially successful, while establishing reporting \nand  transparency  requirements  to  the  government  as  the  owner  of  the  SOEs. \nUnder the bill, responsible ministers must present to Parliament the annual reports \nof public enterprises (which include audited financial statements), while directors \nof public enterprises must take steps to avoid insolvency and could be liable if they \nfail to take reasonable steps to ensure the public enterprise does not incur a debt \nit cannot repay. The bill establishes processes to make SOE delivery of community \nservice obligations financially sustainable; and it directs SOEs to promote gender \nequality through their employment practices, policies, and board memberships. \nState-owned  enterprise  monitoring.  As  a  prior  action,  in  February  2019,  the \ncabinet  approved  the  establishment  and  resourcing  of  the  Public  Enterprise \nMonitoring Unit in the DOF. The unit is responsible for reviewing public enterprise \nperformance  and  advising  the  government  on  issues  such  as  public  enterprise \noperations  and  governance;  community  service  obligations;  the  appointment  of \ndirectors; restructuring initiatives; and investments in, loans to, and guarantees for \npublic enterprises. \n\n \nADB\u2019s value addition and development partner coordination. ADB is coordinating with \n17. \nother development partners to ensure policy actions are correctly sequenced and the TA is well \ntargeted.25 Cooperation is particularly close with Australia and New Zealand. ADB also maintains \na close working relationship with the IMF, including joining the IMF\u2019s Article IV consultations in \nNauru  in  September  2019.  ADB  and  New  Zealand,  which  is  cofinancing  the  program,  have \ncoordinated policy dialogue through a single policy matrix. Australia is financing technical advisors \n\n \n\n23  The register covers government departments and key SOEs. \n24  The prioritization exercise also considered the general safety and security a planned infrastructure investment would \n\nprovide in the public space, which is particularly relevant to women. \n\n25  Development Coordination (accessible from the linked documents Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nto  the  DOF.  Along  with  advisory  support  provided  by  the  IMF\u2019s  Pacific  Financial  Technical \nAssistance  Centre,  this  support  from  Australia  has  helped  the  government  improve  its  budget \ncontrol,  reporting,  and  transparency.  Two  regional  ADB  TA  projects  provided  international \nexpertise and advisory services to support six of the program\u2019s eight prior actions.26 \n \nC. \n \n18. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  public  investment  management  and \nfiscal sustainability strengthened, which are crucial for the effective delivery of public services and \nthe achievement of inclusive growth. Nauru\u2019s public expenditure management will be improved in \nreform  area  1  through  the  full  functionalization  of  the  FMIS,  the  introduction  of  new  financial \ninstructions, the publication and public availability of budget documents and financial statements \nthat include public debt, increased funding of the NTF for future service delivery, and a review of \nprocurement practices that will enable the government to focus on its most pressing procurement \nissues (para. 14). Policy actions in reform area 2 will improve Nauru\u2019s public asset management \nby ensuring better information on the condition and maintenance requirements of public assets \nand the introduction of a framework to prioritize infrastructure spending to enhance asset service \nlife  (para.  15).  In  reform  area  3,  the  establishment  of  an  overarching  policy,  legislative,  and \nmonitoring framework for SOE governance will reduce the fiscal risks that poorly performing SOEs \nand SOE borrowing pose; and free up public resources for critical expenditures (para. 16). Taken \ntogether, the program reforms will promote the strategic allocation of resources, which will help \nNauru  sustain  a  responsible  fiscal  position  and  achieve  inclusive  growth.  By  facilitating  better \nasset  maintenance  and  improving  the  governance  of  SOEs,  the  program  will  also  create \nsynergies  with  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  investments,  including  the  new  seaport  and  solar  facility, \nwhich SOEs will own and manage.27 \n \nD. \n \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $5.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special \n19. \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  Government  of \nNew Zealand will provide $0.32 million in budget support as cofinancing.28 The program will help \nthe  government  to  meet  its  FY2020  budget  financing  gap,  which  is  estimated  at  $15.8  million \nwithout budget support.  \n \nE. \n \nThe program implementation period is from March 2018 to June 2020. The DOF will be \n20. \nthe  executing  agency,  responsible  for  the  program\u2019s  overall  implementation.  This  includes \noverseeing  and  coordinating  the  timely  implementation  of  agreed  policy  actions  with  the \nDepartment  of \nthe \naccomplishment  of  the  policy  actions,  and  managing  disbursements  and  the  maintenance  of \nrecords. The DOF and the Department of Infrastructure Development will be the implementing \nagencies.  Program funding  will  be  provided  as  a  single  tranche  grant  of $5  million  and  will  be \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nthe  SOEs,  providing  evidence  of \n\nInfrastructure  Development  and \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n26  ADB.  2013.

ADB will not administer this financing. \n\n\f9 \n\nwithdrawn  by  the  government  following  satisfaction  of  the  conditions  for  effectiveness.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  the  necessary  counterpart  funds  to  finance  costs  associated  with  the \nimplementation of the reforms under the program. Two regional ADB TA projects supported the \ngovernment to implement the prior actions, while a third regional ADB TA, approved in 2019, will \nsupport  the  government  in  implementing  actions  laid  out  in  the  PPPF.29  The  proceeds  of  the \npolicy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).30 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n21. \nSafeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none will result in or lead \nto involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples. No adverse environmental impacts have \nbeen identified. \n \nGender.  While  ADB\u2019s  2016  Fiscal  Sustainability  Reform  Program  was  classified  no \n22. \ngender elements, the program is classified effective gender mainstreaming and two of the three \nreform areas have gender indicators. In reform area 2, consideration of the job opportunities for \nwomen  that  a  project  will  provide  is  among  the  economic  and  social  criteria  the  government\u2019s \nintegrated  infrastructure  strategic  plan  sets  for  prioritizing  public  infrastructure  spending \n(para. 15). The government plans to incorporate the prioritization process into its budget planning \nbeginning in FY2021 as a PPPF measure. In reform area 3, Nauru\u2019s Public Enterprise Act, 2019 \nrequires public enterprises to promote gender equality in their employment practices and policies \nand on their boards (para. 16). To ensure that directors of public enterprises are fully aware of \ntheir new responsibilities under the Public Enterprise Act, the DOF will coordinate training with \ncurrent and prospective directors, with a target of at least 30% women, as a PPPF measure. \n \nPoverty and social. The improved management of public expenditures and assets the \n23. \nprogram will bring about will help the government maintain public infrastructure and services in \nthe event of economic shocks or declining government revenues. This is critical to the well-being \nand living standards of low-income households and the country\u2019s population overall. Better SOE \ngovernance will also benefit the national welfare, given the dominance of underperforming SOEs \nin  Nauru\u2019s  small  economy  and  the  range  of  services  they  alone  provide.  By  helping  ensure  a \nstrategic  allocation  of  public  resources,  the  program  will  help  safeguard  the  responsible  fiscal \nposition the country needs to improve the lives of its people. \n \n24. \nGovernance. Weaknesses in budget reporting, transparency, and execution have been \nreduced through prior actions completed in the program\u2019s reform area 1 (para. 14). Although the \ngovernment is able to implement its budget, challenges remain in the areas of procurement, cash \nreconciliation, debt management, financial reporting on government equities in SOEs, and policy-\nbased budgeting. Advisory services through development partner TA and ongoing policy dialogue \nare addressing some of these weaknesses.31   \n\n \n\n29  ADB. 2013.

Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.32  Reform  measures  identified  in  the \nPPPF, including the audit of financial statements for FY2017\u2013FY2019, and TA will help address \nthe  remaining  fiduciary  risks.  The  program\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh  the  costs.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended to date)  was  explained  to \nand discussed with the government and the DOF.  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nCapacity constraints and staff \nturnover at government agencies \nand SOEs slow the implementation \nof policy reforms. \nExternal shocks, such as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, undermine the \nfiscal position and/or divert \nadministrative and political attention \naway from reforms. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nReforms are prioritized and sequenced to avoid overburdening the small \npublic administration staff and decision makers. Technical assistance by \ndevelopment partners will continue to help the government undertake the \nrequired policy actions. \nThe program seeks to build fiscal resilience by improving expenditure and \nasset management and the governance of SOEs. The government has \nestablished fiscal cash reserves to provide a cushion against adverse \nexternal shocks. The NTF framework provides for lower, delayed, or no \ngovernment contribution in the event of unforeseen negative shocks. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n26. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement.33 The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n27. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  not  exceeding  $5,000,000  to  Nauru  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment  Fund)  for  the  Improving  Public  Investment  Management  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n12 May 2020 \n\n32  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \n\nStable, trustworthy, and fiscally responsible government developed (National Sustainable Development \nStrategy, 2019\u20132030)a \n\nEnhanced social, infrastructure, and utilities services provided (National Sustainable Development \nStrategy, 2019\u20132030)a \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the Reform \nPublic investment \nmanagement and fiscal \nsustainability \nstrengthened \n\nReform Areas \n \n1.
