An  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be  an \nintegral component of the project preparatory process supported \nunder the technical assistance (TA) loan. The Government of Sri \nLanka  will  provide  assurances  that  any  project  prepared  will  be \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  environmental  guidelines  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nThe TA loan will provide  a  readily  accessible  pool  of  funding  for \nthe  Government  to  conduct  road  project  preparatory  work. \nAssistance will be provided to prepare feasibility studies, including \nenvironmental  and  social  assessment, \nresettlement  plans, \ndetailed  designs,  bid  document  preparation  and  evaluation,  and \ncontract negotiations. Assistance may also be extended to cover \nthe  cost  of  engaging  consultants  to  assess  financial  viability, \nformulate \nthe  project  structure,  and  prepare  concession \nagreements and negotiations for public-private partnership (PPP) \nprojects. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  vision  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  sets  ambitious  development  targets,  which  will  require \nmassive  development  of  road  infrastructure  and  more  private \nsector  participation.  Timely \ninvestment  projects  are \nindispensable  to  economic  progress.  Road  sector  institutions \nneed  to  be  equipped  with  sufficient  capacity  to  carry  out \npreconstruction  activities  on  time  and  efficiently  for  external \nand/or  private  sector  financing.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  a \nfinancing facility that road sector institutions can easily access. \n \nThe objective of the TA loan is to help the Government efficiently \ndevelop  the  road  network.  Focusing  on  road  project  preparation, \nthe  TA  loan  will  (i)  enable  road  sector  institutions  to  conduct \npreconstruction activities on time,  and (ii) ensure readiness of the \nfollow-on  road  infrastructure  projects.  The  TA  loan  will  also  help \nenhance road agencies\u2019 capacity to implement road projects. \n \nThe  financing  facility  will  cover  roads  identified  in  the  investment \nplan  identified  in  the  road  sector  master  plan  currently  being \nprepared  under  ADB-assisted  TA.  The  facility  will  also  cover \nroads  proposed  by  the  Government  as  most  urgent  before  and \nwhile  the  investment  plan  is  developed.  The  TA  loan  will \naccommodate  projects  intended  for  downstream  ADB  financing \nas well as for non-ADB projects. \n \n\nroad \n\n\fCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  is  estimated  at  $20.00  million \nequivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  component  of  $10.25 \nmillion (51% of the total cost) and a local currency component of \n$9.75 million equivalent (49%). \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $15  million  equivalent  to  cover  the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($10.25  million  equivalent)  and  part \nof \n($4.75  million  equivalent).  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  local  cost  of  $5  million \nequivalent.  \n \n\nlocal  currency  costs \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  equivalent  to  $15  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  a  maturity  period  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an annual interest rate of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 31 December 2008 \n \n30 June 2008 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nA  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  give  overall direction \nto  the  TA  loan,  and  will  be  composed  of  representatives  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance;  External  Resource  Department;  Ministry  of \nPolicy  Development  and  Implementation;  Ministry  of  Transport, \nHighways,  and  Civil  Aviation;  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH); \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial  Councils,  and  Local \nGovernment  (MHAPCLG);  National  Planning  Department;  Board \nof  Investment  (BOI);  Road  Development  Authority  (RDA);  Urban \nDevelopment  Authority;  Central  Environmental  Authority;  and \nADB.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  RDA  for  national \nhighways  and  expressways;  relevant  provincial  councils  for \nprovincial  roads;  and  RDA  for  PPP  expressways  in  consultation \nwith  BOI  with  respect  to  financial  advisory  services.  Each \nimplementing agency (IA) will appoint a facilitator to supervise the \nday-to-day project activities.  \n \nMOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  expressways  and \nnational  highways,  and  MHAPCLG  will  be  the  EA  for  provincial \nroads. \n \nAll  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\ntransport \n\ntransport  economics, \n\nTypically  required  for  road  projects  are  specialists  in  highway \nengineering, \nfinance,  social, \nresettlement,  and  environment.  These  specialists  will  help  IAs \ncarry  out  comprehensive  feasibility  analyses  and  engineering \ndesign, prepare bid documents, and help in procurement in a way \nsatisfactory to ADB. Each EA, in consultation with IA, will develop \ndetailed  terms  of  reference  and  associated  resources  to  fulfill \nthem. \n \nInternational consulting firms, in association with domestic ones, \nwill  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based selection \nprocedures. Individual consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nFor  the  first  year  of  implementation,  approximately  50  and  60 \nperson-months of international and domestic consulting services, \nrespectively,  are  required \nfeasibility  and \nengineering  study,  including  procurement  assistance,  for  200-\n300km  top-priority  roads.  Tentative  estimates  for  the  whole  TA \nloan  are  approximately  500  and  600  person-months  of \ninternational and domestic consulting services, respectively. \n \nThe  TA  loan  will  support  efficient  development  of  roads  and \nthereby  contribute  to  national  economic  development.  The  TA \nloan  will  facilitate  road  improvements  without  unnecessary  delay \nand  benefit  road  users  by  enabling  them  to  undertake  economic \nactivities efficiently. The TA loan will ensure that (i) the follow-on \ninvestment  projects  will  be  implemented  without  delay,  (ii) \ndevelopment  impact  of  the  follow-on  investment  projects  will be \nrealized  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  Government  will  minimize \ncommitment  charges  of  the  follow-on  loans  in  case  of  ordinary \ncapital resources. The TA loan will also raise EAs\u2019 and IAs' project \npreparation  capacity  to  international  standards  and  improve \ngovernance  and \nin  consultant  selection  and \nprocurement. \n \n\nfor  a  combined \n\ntransparency \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n1. \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of Sri Lanka for the Road \nProject Preparatory Facility. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Road Sector \n\nthe  goals,  purpose,  scope, \n\nthe  Government  and  ADB  on \n\n \n \nA. \n \n2. \nSri  Lanka  needs  a  modern  and  efficient  road  network  to  promote  faster  economic \ndevelopment as described by the Government of Sri Lanka in the recently published  Regaining \nSri  Lanka:  Vision  and  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Development1.  A  Consultation  Mission  and  a \nFact Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka from 30 September-2 October and from 10-21 November \n2003, respectively. The TA loan was developed based on the Memorandum of Understanding \nsigned  on  21  November  during  the  Fact  Finding  Mission,  which  sets  out  an  understanding \nimplementation \nbetween \narrangements, cost estimate, financing arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR) of the TA \nloan.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nSri  Lanka  has  91,803  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  comprising  11,650  km  of  national \nhighways maintained by the Road Development Authority (RDA); 15,494 km of roads (classes \nC, D, and E) maintained by provincial councils; and 64,659 km of unclassified roads maintained \nby local authorities. The public sector retains most of the responsibilities for providing national \nhighways and other roads. \n \nWhile Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is extensive, most roads were built more than 50 years \n4. \nago.  Road  maintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  new  construction  have  not  kept  abreast  with  the \nrapid  growth  in  demand  for  transport.  Traffic  levels  now  exceed  the  design  capacity of many \nroads.  Uncontrolled  roadside  development  has  also  reduced  the  network\u2019s  capacity.  Due  to \nneglect of road maintenance, national, provincial, and rural road conditions are poor. All of this \nraises road-user costs, makes roads unsafe, and lowers the quality and frequency of transport \nservices.  Inefficient  transport  has  constrained  economic  expansion  and  poverty  reduction. \nUpgrading the road sector\u2019s overall performance is vital to improve the returns and sustainability \nof investments, contribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that make use \nof road transport, and help reduce poverty. \n \n5. \nSince the peace process is progressing, an island-wide approach, including in the north \nand east, is needed to expand the road  network. A needs assessment2 for the north and east \nreveals  that  immediate  rehabilitation  of  the  main  road  network  is  crucial  to  facilitate \nhumanitarian,  social,  and  economic  activities,  and  to  help  bring  back  normalcy.  Critical  needs \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of Sri Lanka, December 2002. \n2   Government  of  Sri  Lanka  with  support  from  ADB,  United  Nations,  and  the  World  Bank.  2003.

Colombo.    \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nGovernment Sector Strategy \n\nfor all the country include (i) sufficient road maintenance, (ii) improvement and rehabilitation of \ndeteriorated road networks, and (iii) construction of expressways connecting major cities. \n \n6. \nCohesive vision and mission are needed for the entire sector to lay out the key strategic \nprinciples  for  road  transport  in  line  with  the  broad  national  goals  for  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  In  this  context  the  midterm  strategy  for  institutional  and  policy  development \nshould  be  implemented  and  adopted,  and  institutional  mechanisms  for  provinces  and  local \nauthorities  strengthened  to  finance  and  deliver  roads.  National,  provincial,  and  rural  road \ndevelopment  will  benefit  poor,  remote  areas  isolated  from  markets.  The  road  sector  master \nplan3 is under preparation. The TA loan will be implemented closely with the road sector master \nplan  that  will  produce  pipeline  sector  investment  projects,  including  those  agreed  on  in  the \nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2004-2008. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe Government adopted a framework of a medium- and long-term sector development \nstrategy after extensive review and dialogue under an ADB TA.4 The Road Sector Development \nProject  (RSDP)5,  approved  in  November  2002,  was  the  first  of  a  series  of  ADB  loans  to  help \nimplement  the  framework.  The  key  targets  under  RSDP  are  (i)  strengthening  RDA,  (ii) \ndeveloping the private sector, and (iii) improving road maintenance funding. \n \n8. \nThe  framework  was  incorporated  and  further  elaborated  in  Regaining Sri Lanka  which \nsets  out  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  To  foster \neconomic growth,  institutional  and  policy  reform  is  needed  to  improve  the  performance  of  the \nroad  sector,  including  increasing  private  sector  participation  and  improving  road  maintenance. \nThe poverty reduction strategy includes creating opportunities for the poor to participate in the \neconomy.  An  important  challenge  is  linking  poor  regions  to  rapidly  growing  domestic  and \ninternational  markets.  Priority  transport  and  communications  initiatives  include  (i)  building  an \nintegrated national highway and road network to connect poor regions and production centers to \ndomestic  and  international  markets,  (ii)  enhancing  the  performance  of  the  bus  system  and \nimplementing  a  fare  policy,  (iii)  improving  road  sector  management,  (iv)  implementing  a \ncomprehensive  traffic  management  policy,  (v)  facilitating  rural  transport  development,  (vi) \ntransport,  and  (vii) \ndesigning  and \ninstitutionalizing road safety and discipline.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nAs of June 2003 the ongoing portfolio amount of ADB loans for the road sector was $321 \nmillion.  The  most  recent  loan  is  RSDP,  approved  in  2002.  The  principal  bilateral  sources  of \nexternal  assistance  have  been  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Kuwait,  and  Sweden.  The  United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) is the largest multilateral grant provider. ADB is the \nlargest  multilateral  provider  and  has  coordinated  its  support  with  other  external  agencies  to \nensure  efficiency  in  road  development.

Recently,  the  World  Bank \ndecided  to  reengage  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  road  sector6.  External  assistance  to  the  road  sector  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nImplementation  of  ADB-assisted  road  projects  in  Sri  Lanka  have  been  delayed  due \nmainly to (i) cumbersome government procurement procedures, affecting projects in all sectors; \n(ii) lack of institutional capacity in RDA for preconstruction and for construction supervision; and \n(iii)  lack  of  capacity  and  inexperience  of  the  domestic  private  sector  in  road  construction  and \nengineering  and  related  services.  Such  weaknesses  include  late  appointment of the technical \nevaluation  committee  (TEC),  low  quality  of  TEC  reports,  delayed  finalization  of  contract \ndocuments, delayed approval by Cabinet Appointed Tender Boards and the Ministry of Tender \nBoards, and slow implementation of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR).  \n \n11.  With  ADB  TA,7  the  Government  simplified  its  procurement  procedures  for  externally \nfunded projects, introduced a system of monitoring procurement performance, and established \nthe  Procurement  Support  Bureau  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  is  reducing  the  time  for \nprocurement and increasing transparency. Weaknesses of LAR implementation under previous \nloans  have  been  improved  under  the  ADB  TAs,8  incorporating  experience  from  the  Southern \nTransport  Development  Project.  RSDP (footnote 5)\u2019s recent progress shows that reforms are \nachieving their targets: (i)  the Road Construction and Development Company, owned by RDA, \nwas closed at the end of January 2004; (ii) SLRs1 billion of work contracts were awarded to 20 \nprivate  contractors  in  2003;  (iii)  reengineering  of  RDA  is  under  way,  e.g.,  a  maintenance \nmanagement unit has been established; and (iv) a road fund was established in 2003 to support \nthe  financing  of  road  maintenance  on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  capacity  of  provincial  road \ndevelopment authorities has also been strengthened through an ongoing program financed by \nADB and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)9. \n \n12. \nA  lesson  is  that  institutional  reforms  need  to  be  comprehensive  but  gradual  and \nsustained  if  they  are  to  produce  lasting  improvements  (footnote  4).  This  is  difficult  to  achieve \nthrough a single project. The programmatic approach brings together ADB\u2019s next interventions \nfor  the  road  sector,  creating  the  opportunity  to  link  financing  of  successive  projects  to \nimplementation  of  a  common  medium-term  reform  agenda.  Another  lesson  learned  from \nprocedural delays in project preparation is that  up-front project activities, such as environmental \nclearances and LAR, need to be completed before the investment loan is contracted, because \nthese kinds of activity often delay disbursement of approved investment loans. Preconstruction \n                                                 \n6   Sri Lanka Road Sector Policy Review Note, 11 November 2003, proposes a specific investment loan for 2005, \ncomprising (i) deferred maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading of priority national highways; (ii) provision of \ncapital grants to encourage public private partnerships (PPP) on national highways, with the possibility of partial \nrisk  guarantees;  (iii)  implementation  support  for  the  proposed  road  fund  and  other  recent  policy  initiatives;  and \n(iv)  a  pilot  component  on  rural  road  maintenance,  which  would  start  the  process  of  building  local  authorities\u2019 \ncapacity to maintain roads.  \n\n7   ADB. 1997.

ADB \nalso recently approved two TAs to prepare (i) the road sector master plan (footnote 3) and (ii) a \npublic-private  partnership  (PPP)  expressway  projects10.  The  first  will  develop  the  overall  road \nsector investment plan and financing strategies, including PPP arrangements, and the second \naims  to  help  the  Government  develop  policy  and  strategy  framework  for  PPP  expressway \nprojects.  Based  on  these  developments,  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  to  expand  ADB \ninvolvement  in  road  sector  development  through  a  sector  loan  approach,  with possible mixed \nloans  of  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  and  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  to  develop \nnational  highways  as  the  Government  needs  assistance  to  accelerate  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction. \n \nG. \n \nIn  view  of  ADB  adopting  a  sector  loan  approach,  introducing  mixed  loans  of  ADF  and \n14. \nOCR,  and  promoting  private  sector  participation,  road  sector  institutions  need  to  be  equipped \nwith  the  capacity  to  efficiently  carry  out  preconstruction  activities.  Successful  project \nimplementation requires timely high-quality preparation works to comply with ADB requirements \nfor  project  processing  and  to  avoid  any  delay.  A  readily  accessible  financing  facility  (the \nFacility),  disbursing  external  and/or  private  sector  funds,  should  be  established  to  allow  road \nsector institutions to efficiently conduct preconstruction activities. \n \n \n\nRationale \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n \n \nA. \n\nObjective \n\n15. \nThe  objective  of  the  TA  loan  is  to  help  the  Government  efficiently  develop  the  road \nnetwork. Focusing on road project preparation, the TA loan will (i) enable road sector institutions \nto  conduct  preconstruction  on  time  without  waiting  for  funds  from  external  agencies,  and  (ii) \nensure  readiness  of  the  follow-on  project  implementation.  The  TA  loan  will  also  help  enhance \nroad agencies\u2019 capacity to implement road projects.  The TA loan is for national and provincial \nroads and expressways, including PPP projects. Appendix 2 presents the project framework. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n16. \nThe  TA  loan  will  provide  the  Facility  to  help  the  Government  (i)  prepare  the  Project, \nincluding feasibility studies, including environmental and social assessment, resettlement plans, \ndetailed designs, and bid documents; and (ii) evaluate bids and negotiate contracts.

The  technical  assistance  will  also  include  assistance  in  preparing \nPublic-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  policy  and  a  model  PPP  project  for  the  future  Colombo-Katunayake \nExpressway. \n\n\f  5\n\nmay  also  be  extended  to  cover  the  cost  of  engaging  consultants  to  prepare  concession \nagreements and negotiations for PPP projects. \n \n17. \nThe Facility will be utilized  for roads identified in the investment plan prepared under the \nroad  sector  master  plan  (footnote  3).  The  Facility  will  also  cover  roads  proposed  by  the \nGovernment  and  which  ADB  agrees  are  urgent,  before  and  while  the  investment  plan  is \ndeveloped. The Facility will accommodate projects intended for downstream ADB financing as \nwell as for non-ADB projects. \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n18. \nThe total cost of the Facility is estimated at $20 million equivalent, including interest on \nthe  TA  loan  during  implementation.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  $10.25  million  and  local \ncurrency cost is $9.75 million equivalent (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nRoad Project Preparatory Facility \nInterest during Implementation \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n9.95 \n0.30 \n\n10.25 \n\n9.75 \n0.00 \n\n9.75 \n\n19.70 \n 0.30 \n\n20.00 \n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $15  million  equivalent  (75%  of  the  total  cost)  to  cover  the \n19. \nentire foreign exchange cost and 48.7% of the local currency cost (Table 2). The Government \nwill finance the remaining local cost of $5 million equivalent, or 25% of the total cost, comprising \nremuneration of counterpart staff; international and local travel; equipment (computers, printers, \netc.); surveys; office accommodation; taxes and duties; and other miscellaneous costs. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n10.25 \n 0.00  \n\n10.25 \n\n4.75 \n5.00 \n\n9.75 \n\n15.00 \n 5.00 \n\n20.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20. \nA  loan  of  $15  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources, \nwith a term of 32 years, including a grace period  of 8 years, with an annual interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n \nA  steering  committee11  will  be  established  to  discuss,  review,  and  approve  the  road \n21. \ndevelopment program, which consists of at least two contract packages, to be assisted by the \nFacility.  The  steering  committee  will  be  co-chaired  by  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of \nTransport,  Highways,  and  Civil  Aviation  (MTHCA);  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial \nCouncils,  and  Local  Government  (MHAPCLG).  Other  members  will  be  representatives  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  External  Resource  Department,  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation  (MPDI),  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH),  National  Planning  Department,  Board  of \nInvestment  (BOI),  RDA,  Urban  Development  Authority,  Central  Environmental  Authority,  and \nADB.  MTHCA  and  MHAPCLG  will  appoint  the  steering  committee  coordinator,  who  will  have \nqualifications acceptable to ADB and convene and facilitate steering committee meetings.  \n \n22. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  national  highways  and  expressways,  included  in  any \npackage,  except  PPP  projects,  will  be  MOH,  and  the  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  will  be  RDA. \nThe  EA  for  provincial  roads  included  in  any  package  will  be  MHAPCLG,  and  IAs  will  be  the \nprovincial  councils  where  the  steering  committee  has  approved  subprojects.  For  PPP \nexpressways, included in any packages or in stand-alone packages, the EA will be MOH, and \nthe  IA  will  be  RDA  (in  consultation  with  BOI  for  financial  advisory  services).  The  EAs  will  (i) \nsupervise  IAs\u2019  work,  (ii)  maintain  the  quality  of  work  programs,  and  (iii)  monitor  the  level  of \nFacility  utilization,  to  ensure  consistency  with  national  development  objectives.  IAs  will \nsupervise the consultants\u2019 work like normal TA projects. \n \n23.  MOH  will  also  work  as  the  Coordinating  Executing  Agency,  in  consultation  with \nMHAPCLG,  for  provincial  roads  included  in  any  package.  RDA  and  MHAPCLG  will  form  a \ncoordinating committee comprised of provincial councils to facilitate the work of consultants and \nencourage ownership of the work at the provincial level. The Coordinating Executing Agency will \nselect and engage consultants, and consolidate project progress and report it to ADB. \n \n24. \nEach EA will nominate a coordinator, acceptable to ADB, to administer the Facility. Each \nIA will have a project facilitator who will work in the coordinating committee  by the time that any \nroads in its jurisdiction are included  in a package. Each facilitator will have capacity to oversee \nsocial, resettlement and environmental issues as well as engineering aspects of each road in its \njurisdiction  included  in  each  package.  The  steering  committee  coordinator  and  each  facilitator \nwill have necessary resources and facilities for implementing their respective works. Appendix 4 \nshows the TA loan organization chart. \n \n25. \n \n26. \nProgramming.  The  steering  committee  will  discuss,  review,  and  approve  a  medium-\nterm  program  for  facility  use.  This  program  will  include  at  least  one  package  to  be  developed \nimmediately  (Package  I)  and  one  package  to  be  developed  after  the  steering  committee \nendorses  the  core  network  in  the  road  sector  master  plan.  Each  package  may  consist  of \nnational  and  provincial  roads,  and  expressways  (para  29).  This  program  may  also  include \npackages  comprised  of  PPP  subprojects.  Each  package  will  be  divided  into  subprojects  or \ncycles  so  that  the  consultants\u2019  work program can be monitored and adjusted when necessary \n\nThe Facility will be utilized as follows (Appendix 5).  \n\n                                                 \n11  \n\nIt is expected that an identical steering committee will function in the road sector master plan project at the same \ntime. \n\n\f  7\n\nand  to  accommodate  the  road  sector  master  plan.  The  steering  committee  will  submit  the \nproposed packages approved by it to ADB for review and approval.  The format of the proposal \nis in Appendix 6. \n \nRecruitment of Consultants. The Coordinating Executing Agency, in consultation with \n27. \nMHAPCLG, and with the written agreement of each provincial council with respect to roads in its \njurisdiction,  will  select  and  engage  the  consultants  who  will  provide  technical  assistance  for \neach  package.  This  process  follows  the  normal  procedure  applied  to  ADB-funded projects in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. ADB will review and approve \nthe processing of consultant recruitment.  \n \nSupervision  of  Consultant\u2019s  Work.  The  Coordinating  Executing  agency  will  be \n28. \nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  consultants  for  each  package,  in  consultation  with  MHAPCLG, \nRDA  and  provincial  councils.  Each  IA  will  provide  logistical  support  to  the  consultants  and \nreview  their  outputs.  The  consultant  contracts  for  each  package  may  be  extended  for \nsuccessive  subprojects  or  cycles  under  the  package  through  contract  variations,  subject  to \nevaluation  by  the  Steering  Committee  and  agreement  by  ADB.  The  steering  committee  will \ndetermine whether such consultants will conduct the successive subprojects or cycles under the \nrelevant  package  contract,  based  on  the  assessment  of  their  performance,  using  transparent \ncriteria notified to the consultants before work begins.  When the steering committee evaluates \nthe consultants\u2019 performance as unsatisfactory, the EA reserves the right to terminate them and \nrecruit new ones for the successive cycle of work. \n \n\n2. \n\nPackage Selection Criteria \n\n \n29. \nGiven  that  it  places  high  priority  on  national  highway  rehabilitation,  the  Government \nwishes  to  expedite  the  use  of  the  Facility.  Provision  was  made  for  the  immediate  use  of  the \nFacility  to  cover  the  cost  of  feasibility  studies  and  engineering  studies  for  the  highest-priority \nroads.  Appendix  7  shows  an  indicative  list  of  high  priority  roads.  About  200-300 km of roads, \nincluding those in Appendix 7, will be selected by the steering committee for the immediate use \nof the Facility before the road sector master plan identifies a core network12. The contract with \nthe  consultant  engaged  for  this  immediate  work  will  be  extended  for  additional  subprojects, \nwhich will become the Package I contract (para 26), subject to the consultant\u2019s performance and \nwork requirements (para 28). \n \nAfter the steering committee endorses the core network in the road sector master plan, \n30. \nthe steering committee will select at least one package, which may consist of both national and \nprovincial roads, primarily based on the road sector master plan and approved by ADB. Those \nroads that  are or will be in ADB\u2019s country program, including subprojects under a ADB sector \nloan, will be given the highest priority for using the  Facility. The steering committee may select \nPPP subprojects, primarily based on the road sector master plan or high priority roads identified \nby the Government and ADB. Roads that will be funded by other external sources will also be \nable to use the Facility. \n \n31. \nBesides  meeting  these  criteria,  the  Project  must  also  be  (i)  economically  feasible;  (ii) \nenvironmentally  responsible,  e.g.,  all  impacts  should  be  mitigable,  and  an  environmental \nassessment  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environm ent  Policy;  and  (iii)  socially \nresponsible,  e.g.,  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \n\n                                                 \n12   A core network is expected to be identified by the road sector master plan in October 2004. \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nResettlement  will  be  prepared  under  the  Project,  an  assessment  will  be  made  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People,  and  road  safety  audits  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Road Safety Audit for Road Projects: A Operational Tool Kit (2003) or \nsimilar procedure acceptable to ADB.   \n \n32. \nIn  addition  to  being  economically  feasible,  the  PPP  subprojects  should  also  clear the \ncriteria defined in the PPP policy and strategy, which will be developed under ADB TA (footnote \n11).  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period \n\n \n33. \nFacility use is expected to start in July 2004 and implemented over 4 years. An indicative \nimplementation  schedule,  assuming  3  contract  packages,  is  in  Appendix  8.  The  indicative \nallocation  of  the  Facility  for  monitoring  purposes  will  be  approximately  40%  for  Package  I  and \n30%  each  for  Packages  II  and  III,  subject  to  change  due  to  the  steering  committee\u2019s \nprogramming during and after development of the road sector master plan. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n34. \nAll  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  steering  committee  will  determine  the  required  goods  and \nservices and submit the request of procurement for ADB approval. As most project procurement \nis  expected  to  be  for  routine  office  and  administrative  equipment  of  small  value  and  most \nefficiently acquired off the shelf, direct procurement procedures are expected to be used. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n35. \nConsulting services for projects that use the Facility may include (i) preparing feasibility \nstudies;  (ii)  preparing  detailed  design;  and  (iii)  assisting  procurement,  which  includes (a) bid \ndocument  preparation  and  evaluation;  (b)  bid  processing;  and  (c)  contract  negotiations  for \nselecting civil works contractors, supervision consultants, and equipment vendors. For privately \nfinanced  projects,  consulting  services  will  be  extended to development of financing structures \nand  concession  agreements,  and  to  contract  negotiation  with  the  private  sector  entity. \nConsultants  will  also  help  prepare  the  environmental  and  social  assessment  and  resettlement \nplan within the feasibility study  for each road. Appendix 9 provides an example outline TOR for \na  combined  feasibility  study  and  engineering  study,  including  procurement  assistance  and \nresettlement planning, for national highway projects. These TOR will be applicable to all type of \nroads. Appendix 10 provides an example outline TOR for PPP arrangements. \n \n36. \nSpecialists are  typically  required  to  have  expertise  in  highway  engineering;  transport \neconomics;  transport  finance;  and  social  issues,  resettlement,  environment,  and  law.  These \nspecialists  are  necessary  to  help  IAs  carry  out  comprehensive  feasibility  analysis  and \nengineering design, prepare bid documents, and help in procurement satisfactory to ADB. The \ndetailed  TOR  of  the  consultants  for  a  proposed  project,  and  the  associated  resources to fulfill \nthe TOR, will be developed by each EA before it submits the proposal to the steering committee \nand then to ADB for review and approval. \n \n37. \nThe  consultants  will  be  firms  of  international  consultants  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants. Individual international and domestic consultants will also be engaged for any tasks \nrequired, independently or in combination with consulting firms. Firms will mainly be responsible \nfor  engineering;  institutional  assessment;  study  of  technical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility \n\n\f  9\n\nof  road  projects;  overall  coordination  of  the  consulting  services;  and  bid  assistance.  Individual \nconsultants  will  mainly  prepare  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  resettlement  plan, \nindigenous people\u2019s development plan (if required), environmental and social assessment, and \npoverty  impact  study.  Individual  consultants  may  also  be  engaged  to  expedite  resettlement \nprocessing.  Either  firms  or  individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  PPP  project  tasks, \ndepending on their nature. \n \n38. \nThe  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures. The individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants.  \n \nThe  outline  TOR  in  Appendix  9  will  be  suitable  for  the  immediate  output  within  the \n39. \nPackage I contract. On the basis of the scope of study for 200-300km roads, about 50 and 60 \nperson-months of international and domestic consulting services, respectively, are estimated as \nrequired for 1 year starting in 2004. About $2 million equivalent (10% of the Facility) from the TA \nloan  will  be  used  for  this.  Immediate  use  of  the  TA  loan  requires  (i)  prompt agreement on the \nroads to be covered; (ii) finalization of terms of reference for consulting services, which include \nfeasibility  and  engineering  studies;  and  (iii)  timely  appointment  of  the  consultants.  Tentative \nestimates for the whole TA loan are approximately 500 and 600 person-months of international \nand  domestic  consulting  services,  respectively.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for \nrecruitment of consultants, without committing approval of the Project or financing of the action. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Ar rangement \n\n \n40. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the  Government \nand  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  consultants based on approved \ncontracts  under  the  direct  payment  procedure.  A  signed  withdrawal  application  must  be \nsubmitted by the Coordinating Executing Agency to ADB together with the consultant's claim or \ninvoice. Part of the administration costs will be disbursed under reimbursement procedure. Any \nindividual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  method \nfor reimbursement of certain eligible expenditures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nEach  EA  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance  in  accordance  with  the  project \n41. \nframework in Appendix 1. Primary monitoring indicators to be used by the EA and reported to \nADB  will  be  (i)  number  of  days  from  between  loan  effectiveness  and  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants; (ii) number of days between loan effectiveness of a follow-on loan and issuance of \nbid documents for civil works; (iii) duration of processing the bid from bid document preparation \nto  contract  closure  with  civil  work  contractors  for  the  follow-on  loan;  and  (iv)  incidence  of \ndisputes  of  environmental,  social  and  resettlement  issues.  The  target  for  each  indicator  is \nindicated in the project framework.  \n \n\n8. \n\nReports \n\n \n42. \nThe steering committee will  monitor  project  execution  to  provide  a  basis  to  identify  the \nnext  program  of  road  development.  Monthly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation \nsubmitted  by  IAs  will  be  consolidated  by  the  Coordinating  Executing  agency.  The  reports  will \nindicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets;  (ii)  problems \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nencountered and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve the problems; and (iii) proposed \nproject  activities  to  be  undertaken  and  progress  expected  during  the  succeeding  6-month \nperiod, including detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. \n \nThe progress report will include sufficient information in summary form. The purpose of \n43. \nthe  report  is  to  enable  the  Government,  the  steering  committee,  EA,  and  ADB  to  monitor the \nlatest  progress,  become  aware  of  problems,  and  assess  whether  the  Project\u2019s  immediate \nobjectives  are  being  met.  Consultants  are  preparing  more  detailed  reports  for  the  EA\u2019s \nmanagement  and  for  use  during  review  missions,  including  midterm  and  project completion \nreview missions. The progress report will contain an executive summary of the detailed reports, \nwith format and content permitting ADB staff to readily capture key information for inputting into \nthe project performance report, the main tool for monitoring project implementation performance \nwithin ADB. \n \n44.  Within 3 months of complete disbursement of the TA loan, each EA will prepare a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Facility established under the TA loan. The report  will \nevaluate  how  effectively  the  Facility  has  helped  IAs  and  the  Government  realize  national \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n45. \nADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews  of  Facility  use,  IAs,  and  projects  to  respond  to \nsignificant fund underutilization, approval of any additional IAs, and need for fund reallocation. A \nmidterm project review will also be carried out around June 2006 to assess the overall progress \nin project implementation and achievements. \n \n\n10. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \nThe  IAs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  financing \n46. \nresources  received  and  expenditures  made  on  the  TA  loan,  including  the  goods,  works,  and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. These TA loan accounts and related \nfinancial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related \nfinancial statements to ADB within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n \n47. \nThe  Facility  will  ensure  that  (i)  follow-on  projects  will  be  implemented  without \nunnecessary delay, (ii) development impact of the follow-on investment projects will materialize \nwithout  delay, and (iii) the Government will minimize unnecessary commitment charges of the \nfollow-on loans in case of OCR. \n \nThe Facility will support efficient development of roads and thereby contribute to national \n48. \neconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Facility  will  provide  roads  without \nunnecessary  delay,  and  benefit  road  users  by  enabling  them  to  undertake  economic  activities \nefficiently.  The  Facility  will  also  improve  the  ownership  in  developing  roads,  strengthen  IAs' \nimprove  governance  and \nproject  preparation  capacity \ntransparency in consultant selection and procurement. \n \n\ninternational  standards  and \n\nto \n\n\f  11\n\nThe risk of not coordinating Facility use with follow-on projects will be addressed by the \n49. \ndecision-making mechanism through the  steering  committee,  involving  all  agencies  relating  to \nroad  development.  The  steering  committee  will  determine  the  road  development  program, \nconsisting of several road projects that will use the Facility and provide the appropriate level of \nFacility use to avoid the risk of overloading IAs and domestic consultants. An identical steering \ncommittee  will  function  in  the  road  sector  master  plan  TA  project  at  the  same  time.  This \narrangement  also  secures  funding  agency  coordination  on  a  pipeline  of  road  projects  in the \ncountry. The Government has agreed to nominate a steering committee coordinator before loan \nnegotiations so that the steering committee can operate effectively. \n \n50. \nThe  risk  of  implementation  delay  will  be  mitigated  by  close  ADB  supervision  of \nimplementation.  ADB  will  be  involved  in  the  steering  committee,  which  will  have  authority  to \ndecide on Facility use. ADB will also guide EAs and IAs in preparing proposals for Facility use to \nensure implementation quality13. To avoid delays in engaging  consultants for immediate Facility \nuse,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  (i)  establish  the  steering  committee  and  nominate  its \ncoordinator, (ii) nominate EA coordinators, (iii) appoint a facilitator at RDA, and (iv) prepare at \nleast one subproject for immediate financing under the Facility. ADB provided the Government \nwith the outline TOR to help the EA and IA prepare the proposal. Consultant engagement, and \nprocurement will also follow ADB guidelines to ensure transparent and competitive processes. \n \nThe  Facility  is  expected  to  ensure  development  of  environmentally  and  socially  viable \n51. \nprojects  (Appendix  11).  Projects  under  follow-on  loans  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with \ngovernment  and  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines,  regulations,  and  policies.  The \nFacility is not expected to have any adverse environmental consequences due to the nature of \nproject  preparation.  Environmental  impacts  relating  to  follow-on  loans  will  be  examined  and \nmitigated  in  accordance  with  government  and  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines, \nregulations, and policies. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nBesides the standard assurances, the Government has given the following  assurances, \n\n52. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDetailed TOR for the consultants will be presented in each approved packages. \nThe  steering  committee  will  ensure  that  the  TOR  for  consultants  will  be \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  in  the  outline  TOR  attached  as \nAppendixes 9 and 10. \n\nThe Government will ensure that all projects will be prepared in accordance with \n(a)  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and  policy,  and  (b)  ADB's \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003). \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  a  resettlement  plan  is  prepared  under  each \npackage  for  each  road  project  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations  such  as  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Policy \n\n                                                 \n13   For  provincial  roads,  ongoing  provincial  road  development  projects  funded  by  ADB  and  JBIC  have  also  been \n\nhelping selected provincial councils build their capacity to undertake preconstruction.  \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy \n\n(1995),  and  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \non \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998),  and  that  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1999) is implemented. \n\nThe Government will undertake road safety audits for all subprojects and ensure \nthat these audits are conducted in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Road Safety Audit for \nRoad Projects: An Operational Tool Kit (2003) or similar procedure acceptable to \nADB. \n\nIA  will  appoint  a  competent \n\nfacilitator,  with  social,  resettlement, \nEach \nenvironmental, and engineering capacity, acceptable to ADB by the time that any \nroads in its jurisdiction are included in a package.  \n\nEach EA and IA will provide adequate resources and facilities to implement the \nprojects effectively. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  each  IA  (other  than  RDA,  which  will  have \nentered into the project agreement) and each PPP company will, at the time of or

Its objectives are  to (i) reduce the costs incurred by users of the road network \nby improving important sections of it, (ii) increase the life of other road sections by appropriate \nperiodic maintenance, and (iii) continue developing the domestic road-contracting industry. \n\n2. \nThe Coordinating Executing Agency will engage qualified international consultants who, \nin  association  with  domestic  consultants,  will  undertake  the  tasks  set  out  in  these  terms  of \nreference (TOR). The consultants will be selected in accordance with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB on the \nrecruitment of domestic consultants. \n\n3. \nThe  following  tasks  (para.  6)  describe  one  subproject  or  work  cycle  for  immediate \noutputs,  assuming  national  highways,  which  may  be  extended  to  one  contract  package  for \nadditional work requirements, subject to consultant\u2019s performance. With minor modifications, the \nTOR could be used for successive subprojects or work cycles and all types of roads.  \n\n4. \nIn this example TOR, the screening study (para. 7) relates specifically to the immediate \nuse  of  the  TA  Loan.  In  subsequent  subprojects  within  this  initial  contract  package  and  the \nfollowing  packages,  a  screening  study  might  not  be  necessary  because  road  projects  will  be \nprioritized once the road sector master plan is completed.  \n\n5. \nThe  steering  committee  will  determine  whether  the  consultant  will  continue  the \nsubprogram  contract  for  the  successive  cycle,  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  consultant\u2019s \nperformance.  \n\nB.  \n\nScope of the Technical Assistance \n\nThe assistance will be implemented in two phases. The first, for preparatory studies, and \n\n6. \nthe second, for preconstruction activities, will be divided into two parts.  \n\n1. \n\nPhase 1: Preparatory Study  \n\na. \n\nScreening Study  \n\n \n7. \ncommittee by doing the following:  \n\nThe  consultants  will  select  potential  project  roads  in  consultation  with the coordinating \n\n(i) \n\nReview  studies  of  road  projects  and  other  social  and  economic  development \nprojects  recently  completed  or  under  way \nto  understand \ndevelopment initiatives relevant to the Project, especially in the road sector, and \nhelp forecast traffic growth.  \n\nin  Sri  Lanka \n\n\f \n\n24\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nReview surveys and data (e.g., traffic and roughness) relating to the long list of \npossible candidate road improvements proposed by RDA (about 500 kilometers \n[km]), \nimprovement  and  deferred \nmaintenance.  \n\nrequiring  substantial \n\nincluding \n\nthose \n\nThe  screening  study  will  review  those  roads,  taking  into  account  their  role  in \nmeeting  the  country\u2019s  development  objectives,  and  in  serving  areas  where \nunemployment and poverty are significant. The screening process will also take \ninto  account  traffic  volume,  pavement  conditions,  safety  and  environmental \nconsiderations, and the costs and benefits of the improvements, e.g., with use of \nbenefit-cost ratios. \n\nThe output of the screening will be a list of roads that need to be studied further, \nconsisting  of  about  200\u2013300 km that require substantial improvements. The list \nwill be considered by RDA, ADB, and the consultants at a tripartite meeting. The \nfinal list will become the basis for the subsequent feasibility study.  \n\nThe terms of reference for the consultants for feasibility study include, but are not limited \n\nb. \n\nFeasibility Study \n\n \n8. \nto, the following: \n \n\ni.  \n\nEngineering Study \n\n9. \n\nThe consultants will have the following tasks: \n\nSurvey  conditions  of  candidate  roads,  including  geometric  features,  type  and \ncondition  of  drainage  structures,  pavement  strength,  and  other  major  features; \ndetermine residual life; and categorize the roads into homogeneous sections.  \n\nInvestigate  the  suitability  of  local  construction  materials,  and,  where  necessary, \nlocate  new  quarries  and  barrow  pits,  and  assess  the  quality  and  quantity  of \nmaterials and hauling distances. \n\nStudy and propose technical options for improving sections on candidate roads, \nincluding  consideration  of  geometric  alignment,  pavement  strengthening,  and \nrehabilitation and/or widening of bridges, taking into account traffic forecasts and, \nwherever  possible,  seeking \ninvoluntary \nresettlement. \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\nto  avoid \n\nPrepare  cost  estimates  for  proposed  improvements  for  each  candidate  road, \nseparating foreign exchange, local currency, and tax and duty elements. \n\nPropose an approach to contract packaging, taking into account (a) the location \nof  the  project  roads,  size  of  contracts,  and  other  project-specific  factors;  (b) \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement; and (c) the aim of supporting development of \nstrong,  competitive  domestic  private  sector  capacity  in  road  construction  and \nengineering services. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n25\n\n(vi) \n\nDefine  the  scope  and  cost  of  detailed  engineering  design;  and  prepare  draft \nterms of reference, and estimates of person-months of inputs and cost. \n\n(vii)  Prepare a report summarizing the findings and recommendations, and presenting \nthe supporting data and analysis, for review by the Government and ADB.  \n\n(viii) \n\nIn cooperation with RDA, consult with stakeholders regarding project design, and \nensure that the selected roads reflect the result of consultation. \n\n(ix) \n\nConduct  road  safety  audits  with  use  of  ADB\u2019s  Road  Safety  Audit  for  Road \nProject; An Operational Tool Kit or similar procedure acceptable to ADB.  \n\nii.  \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n10. \n\nThe consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n\nReview  existing  traffic  data,  conduct  traffic  counts  and  origin-destination  and \naxle-load surveys, and forecast traffic for each candidate road. \n\nPrepare  an  economic  analysis  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  using  the \nHighway  Development  and  Management  model  (version  4)  individually  and  in \ncombination;  distribution  analysis;  and  estimation  of  the  poverty  impact  ratio \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n\nOptimize  the  Project,  considering  likely  financing  limitations,  to  develop  a \nrecommended  priority  ranking  and  a  recommended  set  of  primary  road \nimprovements  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project  (about  200-300 km), taking \ninto  account  economic  rates  of  return,  network  considerations,  findings  of  the \ninitial  social  assessment,  and  expected  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic \nimpacts. \n\n(iv) \n\nPrepare  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  in  relation  to  changes  in  key  parameters, \nand calculate switching values.  \n\niii. \n\nSocial Assessment \n\nThe consultants will carry out the following tasks: \n\n11. \n \n\nConduct an initial poverty and social analysis,  including assessment of possible \nin \nfor \nland  acquisition/relocation \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in \nBank Operations.

The  reports  will  also  identify  matters  that  may \ndelay or impact on project objectives, and set out how they are to be addressed. \n\nD. \n\nConsultants \n\nOn the basis of the scope of work, about 50 and 60 person-months of international and \n24. \ndomestic  consulting  services,  respectively,  are  estimated  to  be  required.  Expertise  required \nincludes highway and pavement engineering, transport economics, and structural engineering. \nThe requirement for senior domestic consultants, in broadly similar fields, is estimated to be the \nsame. Other domestic consultants\u2019 personnel will be required for technical and other aspects of \nthe  TA,  particularly  traffic,  roughness,  and  other  surveys  such  as  social  and  environmental \nstudies.  However,  consultants  are  at  liberty  to  propose  alternative  staffing  arrangements, \nwithout significant change in the international inputs, to achieve the TA objectives.  \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n25.  Within RDA, the director for contract management will be responsible for managing the \nTA, assign a senior officer to provide day-to-day liaison and assistance to the consultants, and \narrange for them to be provided with necessary information and facilities. \n\nF. \n\nSchedule  \n\n26. \n\nAn indicative schedule for the TA (first cycle for the immediate output) is as follows:  \n\nServices commence    \n \n \n \nPhase 1 completed \nPhase 2 (detailed engineering) complete  October 2005  \nPhase 2 (procurement) complete  \n\nOctober 2004  \nMarch 2005 \n\n \n \n\nA  similar  schedule  will  be  applicable  to  the  successive  cycle  of  work  and  all  types  of \n\nDetermined by approvals of follow-on loans, \netc. \n\n27. \nroads. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n  31\n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR \nTHE FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISOR FOR A PUBLIC PRIVATE  \nPARTNERSHIP SUBPROJECT  \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nTasks relating to Public Private partnership (PPP) must be based on the Government\u2019s \nPPP  policy  and  strategy,  and  a  model  concession  agreement,  developed  in  a  technical \nassistance.1 . \n \n2. \n \n\nThe PPP package should be developed in consideration of the following five aspects:  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nPhysical packaging will be primarily determined by the coordinating, which will \nprepare the detailed design report. To make the PPP subproject attractive to the \nprivate  sector,  the  physical  packages  may  sometimes  need  to  be  modified  (for \ninstance,  the  combination  of  \u201cbrown  field\u201d  and  \u201cgreen  field\u201d  investments  or  a \ndecision  on  whether  the  construction  of  a  major  bridge  is  to  be  included  in  the \nPPP package). The financial and legal advisor should develop recommendations \non these aspects to RDA in finalizing the physical package. \n\nStrategic  packaging  largely  pertains  to  tolling  strategy,  traffic  count,  tolling \ntechnology  selection,  and  optimization  modeling.  Tolling  strategy,  traffic  count, \ntolling technology selection, and optimization modeling needs to be reviewed by \nthe financial and legal advisor. \n\nInvestment  packaging  essentially  entails  selecting  the  best  PPP  scheme. \nPossible  options  for  the  PPP  scheme  include  (i)  annuity-based  Build  Operate \nTransfer  (BOT)  concession;  (ii)  modified  version  of  the  annuity-based  BOT \nscheme  with  partial  transfer  of  commercial  risk  to  the  private  sector  within  the \nframework  of  the  current  annuity-based  BOT  model  agreement;  (iii)  special-\npurpose  vehicle;  (iv)  combination  of  \u201cgreen  field  and  brown  field\u201d  BOT \nconcession;  (v)  toll-based  BOT  with  a  grant  provided  to  the  concessionaire  to \ncover a substantial part of the initial capital cost; and (vi) toll-based BOT with no \nor  little  grant.  Based  on  this  exercise,  the  financial  and  legal  advisor  would \nformulate investment proposition.  \n\nProcess  packaging  will  be  carried  out  in  MOH\u2019s  selection  of  a  concessionaire \nthrough  bidding.  A  key  task  is  to  structure  the  concession  agreement, including \nthe period of concession and the way to provide subsidies to contractors, and to \ndevelop  bidding  documents,  including  concession  agreement  together  with  the \nselection criteria of bidders. The financial and legal advisor will assist MOH  and \nthe bid evaluation teams.  \n\n \n3. \nthe scope of the work for the financial advisor is defined in the next section.  \n\nWhile the extent of involvement by the financial advisor will differ from stage to stage, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

The  objective  of  this  advisory  service  is  to  produce  a \nfinancially  viable  concession  to  address  the  principal  issues  related  to  project  risks  and \nadequate returns to the concessionaire. \n \n5. \n \n\nThe advisory services will involve the following activities:  \n\n(i) \n\nPhysical  packaging  stage.  The  financial  and  legal  advisor  will  examine  the \noverall viability of packaging, considering all aspects associated with the design \nstandards,  environmental  and  social  aspects,  and  location  of  alternative  roads \nand service roads.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nStrategic Packaging Stage. The financial and legal advisor will do the following: \n\nReview the results of consultants\u2019 traffic counts.  \nDevelop  tolling  options  to  ensure  that  the  use  and  placement  of  barrier \nand  exit  tolling  stations  are  to  achieve  a  reasonable  level  of  capture  of \ntraffic using the road. \nExamine the impacts of the tolling at each station to determine the likely \nimpact on diversion. \nRevise the estimate of toll revenues during the concession. \nConduct  risk  assessment  by  reviewing  the  allocation  of  risks  under  the \nmodel concession agreements, and  proposing changes in risk allocation \nto  make  the  concessions  more  attractive  to  the  private  sector  without \nsignificantly increasing the liabilities of MOH. \nDevelop  a  conceptual \nto  design  a  bidding  package, \nconsidering  a  variety  of  specific  factors,  including  requirements  for \nperiodic  maintenance  based  on  performance  parameters,  and  terms  for \nearly termination. \n\nframework \n\nInvestment  Packaging  Stage.  The  financial  and  legal  advisor  will  do  the \nfollowing: \n\nFinalize the selection of scheme among the possible PPP schemes. \nPrepare an investment proposition.  \nDevelop a project information memorandum, project financial plan, project \nrisk allocation structures, and possible government support strategies. \n\nProcess packaging stage. The financial and legal advisor will do the following: \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n(iv) \n \n\nReview  and  modify  the  draft  concession  documents  to  provide  a \nconcession that is effective and not likely to require capital subsidy. \nHold  informal  meetings  with  financiers,  contractors,  and  government \nofficials  to  obtain  their  reaction  to  the  proposed  concession  framework, \nand further revise the concession documents.  \nConduct a series of workshops for investors, particularly contractors and \nfinanciers, to generate interest in the PPP component. \nDevelop a strategy for negotiation with the contractor.  \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n33\n\nQualification \n\nC. \n \n6. \nA  financial and legal advisor  has  worked  with  the  Government  and  is  familiar  with  the \nrequirements  for  PSP-based  road  projects  from  the  perspective  of  the  Government  and \ninvestors. The financial and legal advisor must be familiar with the investment environment and \nregulations in South Asia Region.  \n \n7. \nBoard  of  Investment  (BOI)  will  engage  the  financial  advisor  with  loan  proceeds  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The financial and \nlegal advisor will work for MOH and BOI intermittently for 12 months, with services estimated to \nlast 4 person-months for one PPP subproject. \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS REPORT  \n \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority in country \npoverty analysis?
