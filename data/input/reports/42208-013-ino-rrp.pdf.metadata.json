I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance  Reform  Program.  The  program  will  support  government  efforts  to  improve  living \nstandards  and  local  service  delivery  by  implementing  an  efficient  and  equitable  system  of \nintergovernment fiscal relations. The reform priorities include efforts to improve the policy framework \nfor fiscal decentralization, strengthen the capacity of regional government officials, and develop \nperformance-oriented management systems.1 \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Indonesia has made significant progress implementing decentralization reforms. Since 2001, \nthe  government  has  effectively  devolved  key  expenditure  and  revenue  functions  to  regional \ngovernments; by 2010 they accounted for a third of total public expenditure. These reforms have \nhad positive impacts on improving governance in terms of increased local participation in the budget \nprocess, greater transparency, and accountability. Some evidence indicates that decentralization \nhas stimulated economic growth in local economies, at least in the medium term. It has also \ncontributed to the government\u2019s poverty reduction goals. Nevertheless, the government recognizes \nthat  fiscal  decentralization  is  still  in  its  early  stages  and  continues  to  refine  and  advance  its \ndecentralization reform agenda. \n \n3.  Improved living standards are observed across the country, but significant challenges remain \nfor inclusive development. As the country sustains high economic growth, the percentage of poor \npeople in Indonesia has fallen from around 16.6% in 2007 to 13.3% in 2010.2 However, regional \ndisparities in terms of poverty rates and access to basic services continue. In 2010, Maluku province \nreported a poverty rate of 27.7%, compared with 3.5% in Jakarta and 4.3% in Bali. Inequalities \nextend to other human development dimensions. East Maluku reported a human development index \n(HDI)3 of 70.96 in 2009, well below the Jakarta HDI of 77.36. The percentage of households with \nimproved sanitation in Yogyakarta is more than 75%, compared with around 25% in Papua and \nKalimantan Tengah. At least 12 provinces report that fewer than 70% of their households have \naccess to electricity; about 12 provinces report almost full coverage. Future progress in reducing \npoverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals will largely depend on improved access \nto, and quality of, basic services delivered to the local population. \n \n4.  Indonesia\u2019s long-term decentralization policy objectives are to improve the delivery of basic \nservices and infrastructure to local communities across the country (National Action Plan for Fiscal \nDecentralization [NAPFD] 2010\u20132014). Since implementation of \u201cbig bang\u201d decentralization reforms \nin  2001,  regional  governments  are  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  most  basic  services.  Thus, \nimproving the efficiency and equity of the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations is essential to \nachieve further gains in poverty reduction. The government aims to distribute available financing to \nregional governments to ensure comparable coverage of basic services across the country. Since \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1; the list of linked documents is in Appendix 2; the development \npolicy letter is in Appendix 3; and the policy matrix, listing the triggers and milestones defined for this program, and \nincluding the postprogram partnership framework, is in Appendix 4. \n2  Badan Pusat Statistik. 2011. Indonesia Poverty Data (http://dds.bps.go.id/eng/aboutus.php?tabel=1&id_subyek=23) \n3  HDI is a composite statistic used to rank provinces by level of \"human development\" and separate \"very high human \ndevelopment,\" \"high human development,\" \"medium human development,\" and \"low human development\" provinces. \nThe  Center  Bureau  of  Statistics  prepares  the  provincial  HDI  in  Indonesia.  The  statistics  comprise  data  on  life \nexpectancy, education, and per-capita gross national income (as an indicator of standard of living or income) collected \nby subnational governments. \n ", "2   \n2003, ADB has been actively supporting fiscal decentralization with a combination of technical \nassistance (TA) and program and project loans.4 \n \n5.  The last decade of decentralization reforms has transformed Indonesia\u2019s service delivery \nsystems. The 524 subnational governments (33 provinces and 491 districts) currently account for \nabout 33% of total public expenditure, up from barely 7% in 2000. The reforms launched in 2001 \ninvolved  a  massive  delegation  of  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  public  services  and  the \nreassignment  of  two-thirds  of central  government  civil  servants  and  more than  16,000  service \ndelivery  facilities  to  regional  governments.  Ensuring  an  efficient  assignment  of  expenditure \nresponsibilities to subnational governments is a long-term process requiring regular monitoring and \nreview. \n \n6.  Local  service  delivery  is  mostly  financed  with  central  government  grants,  with  growing \ncontributions from local revenue and borrowing. Currently, the largest unconditional grant available \nto regional governments (the General Allocation Fund [DAU]) accounts, on average, for 50% of total \nsubnational government revenues. The provincial and regional government share of revenues from \nextractive industries (the dana bagi hasil [revenue sharing]) represents 17% of their revenues; an \nadditional 7% is accounted for by the infrastructure development grant (the Specific Allocation Fund \n[DAK]). Total grants to subnational governments have more than doubled since 2005, from an \nestimated Rp150 trillion to around Rp350 trillion in 2010. Local revenue, from limited taxes and \ncharges,  represented  about  16%  of  total  subnational  government  revenue.  However,  recent \nassignments of new sources of revenue to subnational governments are likely to increase the \nimportance of this building block of subnational financing. The government has taken a cautionary \napproach  to  the  development  of  subnational  borrowing  powers.  As  a  result,  total  outstanding \nsubnational debt was reportedly just around 0.15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. \n \n7.  Rationalizing criteria for new local government formation. From 1999 to 2008, as a \nconsequence of previously repressed demands for regional autonomy, seven new provinces and \nabout 190 new regional governments were created. The creation of new local governments requires \nthe application of sound technical criteria. On that basis, the government is reviewing the current \nregulatory  framework  to  include  minimum  population  and  administrative  capacity  requirements, \ntogether with adequate assessments of local fiscal capacity, prior to granting new jurisdictional \nstatus. In addition, the design of grants and revenue-sharing mechanisms is being evaluated to \navoid introducing perverse incentives to new government formation. \n \n8.  Mainstreaming  gender  in  policy  and  budget  formulation.  Policy  formulation  and \nregulatory developments for fiscal decentralization continue to incorporate gender considerations. In \naddition, budgetary allocations at all levels of government are starting to reflect the importance \nendowed to gender aspects of strategic policy formulation. The government has taken several \nimportant steps, but the rollout of gender-sensitive budget formulation to regional governments is the \nnext critical challenge. \n \n9.  New  approach  to  decentralization. Earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to \ndecentralization in Indonesia assisted the development of the policy and institutional framework for \nreforms, including the creation of the Directorate General for Fiscal Balance (DGFB) at the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), the definition of clearer expenditure assignments (e.g., issuance of Government \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2005.

Manila  (Loans  2192-INO  and  2193-INO  for  $330  million);  and  ADB.  2008.

The draft ADB 2011\u2013\n2015 country strategy and program for Indonesia identifies fiscal decentralization as key to efficient \npublic service delivery, and essential for more inclusive growth and improved living standards. As \nthe system of intergovernmental fiscal relations in Indonesia matures, and regional governments \nadopt the central government procurement process, future ADB support in this area will likely be \nmore targeted to specific policy areas such as the devolution of the land and building tax. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  expected  impact  of the  program  is more efficient,  effective,  and equitable  regional \ngovernment  spending.  The  expected  outcome  is  improved  organizational  capacity  of  regional \ngovernments,  which  operate  in  a  more  transparent,  effective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal \nenvironment for fiscal decentralization, financial management, and service delivery. The latter is \nfacilitated via efficient local government support systems, human resource capacity, and system \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11  The  program  supports  government\u2019s  efforts  in  six  core  reform  areas:  (i)  strengthening \nmanagement  and  coordination  of  fiscal  decentralization;  (ii)  clarifying  regional  administration \narrangements to improve services and accountability; (iii) enhancing equalization, predictability, and \ntransparency in release of fiscal transfers and shared revenue; (iv) reducing dependency on fiscal \ntransfers by developing more buoyant sources of local revenue; (v) strengthening management of \nregional reserves and debt; and (vi) improving capacity development for gender budgeting and \ngender  mainstreaming,  public  financial  management,  and  accountability.  The  program  is  fully \naligned with the decentralization goals defined under the NAPFD. \n \n12.  The report and recommendation of the President for subprogram 1 of the Local Government \nFinance and Governance Reform 2 identified 14 policy triggers for subprogram 2 (footnote 4). In the \nprocess of assessing implementation progress, the government proposed four additional triggers \n(Appendix 12): the implementation of gender responsive budgeting, strengthening oversight and \ncoordinating role of provincial governors, improved transparency in DAU allocation, and the starting \nof devolution of property transfer tax to the region. All 58 measures (18 triggers and 40 milestones) \nincluded in the program\u2019s policy matrix were accomplished by the end of August 2011 (Appendix 4). \nThe immediate and medium-term challenges are briefly outlined in the post program partnership \nframework  (PPPF)  in  the  program\u2019s  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  The  PPPF  reflects  the  main \nrecommendations from ADB\u2019s special evaluation study5 and: (i) advocates for continued support to \nthe development of the policy framework and institution building (with a particular emphasis on \ndemand-side  aspects  of  decentralization),  (ii)  identifies  government  priorities  for  reform  and \nemphasizes  needed  improvements  to  the  policy  coordination  framework,  and  (iii)  has  been \ndiscussed with major development partners.6 \n \n1.  Strengthened Management and Coordination of Fiscal Decentralization \n \n13.  Substantial progress has been achieved in the review and completion of the policy and \nregulatory framework for fiscal decentralization, including finalization of the draft Grand Strategy for \nFiscal Decentralization (GSFD) and the NAPFD 2010\u20132014. The GSFD has been used to set long-\nterm  directions  for  fiscal  decentralization,  influencing  draft  amendments  to  Law  33  on  Fiscal \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010. Special Evaluation Study: Asian Development Bank Support for Decentralization in Indonesia. Manila. \n6  The proposed project will be supported by an associated capacity development TA for Second Local Government \nFinance and Governance Reform Program, which is being separately processed for expected approval in 2011. \n ", "4   \nBalance.7 The policy framework for decentralization has been strengthened  with two additional \ncomponents:  (i)  the  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN)  2010\u20132014;  and  \n(ii) completion of academic papers for the preparation of amendments to Law 328 and Law 33. The \nlatter  documents  (for  which  female  representation  was  ensured  in  the  drafting  teams)  have \nmainstreamed gender equity during their formulation, a process facilitated by the Ministry for the \nDevelopment of Women and Protection of Children (MDWPC). Future challenges, as outlined in the \nPPPF, include the deepening of regular consultation mechanisms with subnational governments, \ncivil  society  organizations,  and  private  sector  representatives  in  order  to  assess  policy \nimplementation and enrich dialogue among institutions. \n \n14.  DGFB was established as the leading national agency for fiscal decentralization reforms. It \nhas led consultative mechanisms for policy and regulatory reforms with government agencies and \nbeen largely in charge of aid coordination. The latter included the preparation, through the tim \nasistensi (assistance team), of the GSFD, and the ongoing review of Law 33. DGFB also co-chairs \nmeetings of the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council. It has provided leadership to ADB\u2019s Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform Program (it has been the  executing agency for \nseveral ADB TA projects)9 and other development partner programs,10 and has coordinated through \nformal and informal arrangements with key central ministries and regional governments. DGFB \nprovides regular information on fiscal decentralization matters, especially through a chapter on fiscal \ndecentralization in the Financial Notes for the 2011 Annual Budget. Decentralization policy design \nand coordination remains a challenge. The current government regulatory review is assessing the \ncentral government\u2019s institutional framework for policy coordination and is reconsidering the role of \nall relevant stakeholders. Of particular importance will be the definition of the role of provincial \nadministrations as a key element of the system of central\u2013subnational fiscal relations. \n \n2.  Clarified  Regional  Administration  Arrangements  to  Improve  Services  and \nAccountability \n \n15.  The effort devoted to the refinement of expenditure assignments in Indonesia has been \nconstant and significant. The framework for the definition and review of functional assignments is \nnow  complete  with  four  main  elements:  (i)  Law  32  on  Regional  Autonomy;  (ii)  Government \nRegulation 38/2007 dealing with functional assignments across tiers of government; (iii) standard,  \nprosedur,  dan  kriteria  (norms,  standards,  procedures,  and  criteria)  for  service  delivery  by  line \nministries;  and  (iv)  the  standard  prosedur  minimum  (minimum  service  standards).  The  Dewan \nPerwakilan Rakyat (House of Representatives) is scheduled to discuss amendments to Law 32, \nincluding a review of expenditure assignments by tiers of government, in 2011. Upon approval, such \namendments  will  form  the  core  of  the  revision  of  GR  38/2007.  About  40  norms,  standards, \nprocedures, and criteria have already been completed by key social sectors including education and \nhealth, and the process to clarify responsibilities in service delivery will continue in the remaining \nministries over the next few years. Furthermore, 13 ministries11 have developed minimum standard \n                                                \n7 Law 33 importantly outlines the system of regional financing, including transfer mechanisms from the central to regional \ngovernments. \n8  Among other aspects, Law 32 provides a first statement of expenditure responsibilities by tier of government and \nregulates procedures for new regional government creation. \n9  ADB. 2008.

The  latter  include  basic  education  and  health  services,  and  the \nintegration of gender issues on domestic violence against women and children. \n \n16.  The uncontrolled proliferation of new subnational governments, prevalent during the first few \nyears of decentralization reforms, has been stopped. A moratorium on the processing of applications \nfor new regions has been in place since mid-2009 and pending further legal reforms will remain in \neffect until 2014, as stated in the RPJMN for 2010\u20132014. Draft amendments to Law 32 incorporate \nsound criteria to guide the processing of applications for the creation of new jurisdictions. In addition, \nthe recently  approved Desain  Besar  Penataan  Daerah  (Grand  Design  on  Regional  Autonomy) \nproposes tightening the administrative procedures for establishing new regions, including a 3-year \nevaluation period prior to granting local government status. \n \n17.  The government has taken important steps to strengthen the oversight and coordinating role \nof provincial governors in the framework of intergovernmental fiscal relations. They have revised the \ngovernment regulation on the roles and responsibilities of provincial governor to strengthen the role \nof governor (Government Regulation 23/2011); issued a joint circulation letter between MOF, the \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) on \nthe implementation of the GR 23/2011; and, reflected changes in the desired role of provincial \ngovernors in the draft amendments to Law 32/2004. \n \n3.  Enhanced Equalization, Predictability, and Transparency in Release of Fiscal \nTransfers and Shared Revenue \n \n18.  The  equalization  potential  of  the  DAU  has  been  improved.  Presidential  Decree  5/2010 \n(RPJMN 2010\u20132014) instructs the government to provide greater flexibility in the allocation of DAU \nfunds by delinking wage payments from DAU allocations, thus releasing additional resources for \npoorer regions. In practice, the government has pegged the amount devoted to wage payments from \nthe  DAU  to  below  50%  of  the  total  allocation.  The  process  will  need  to  be  completed  with \namendments to Law 33, legally delinking the wage component from the DAU formula. Improved \ntransparency in DAU allocation is now achieved by the recent publication of the national formula and \nweights used for the distribution of the DAU to provinces in the annual supplementary budget \ndocuments.  Future  reforms  should  consider  removing  adjustments  that  make  grant  allocation \ndiscretionary, thereby improving overall effectiveness of public expenditure. \n \n19.  Predictability in fiscal transfers is improved with the progressive incorporation of a system of \nforward estimates for all major grants into the budget formulation process. Although their importance \nvaries greatly across jurisdictions, on average central government transfers (including grants and \nrevenue sharing from national taxes on resource industries) account for more than 80% of regional \ngovernment revenue. With limited discretionary power over their own revenue sources, regional \ngovernments require predictability over the medium-term on the assignment of central government \ntransfers (both in terms of regular financial flows and the stability of the estimated annual amounts \nreceived). Acknowledging the importance of adequate fiscal information, the new budget manual \nrequires the implementation of forward estimates for 3 years. The 2009 national budget already \ncontained forward estimates of transfers to regions as a percentage of GDP. Further, MOF has \nincluded nominal forward estimates for each major transfer as part of the formulation of its medium-\nterm  expenditure  framework.  Future  work  will  require  improving  available  annual  budgetary \ninformation of regional governments to allow for effective implementation of the RPJMN for 2010\u2013\n2014. \n \n ", "6   \n20.  Efficiency in regional government budgetary appropriations has been enhanced. Significant \n\u201cincorrectly\u201d deconcentrated expenditures12 were identified for the Ministry of National Education \n(approximately  Rp20  trillion  in  2008  values).13 The  main  transgressing education  program (the \nSchool  Operational  Assistance  Program,  which  constitutes  more  than  50%  of  the  Ministry  of \nNational  Education  deconcentrated  expenditure)  was  moved  from  government  deconcentrated \nfunding to alternative funding, and thus devolved to the regional governments. This has improved \nthe discretionary expenditure power of regional administrations from conditional education transfers. \n \n4.  Reduced  Dependency  on  Fiscal  Transfers  by  Developing  More  Buoyant \nSources of Local Revenue \n \n21.  During the program, the government assigned important revenue sources to subnational \ngovernments, progressing beyond the originally defined policy goals in this area of reform. Gradual \ndevolution of the land and building tax and the property transfer tax started in January 2011, upon \nenactment of Law 28/2009 on Regional Government Revenues and Charges. The government plans \nto fully devolve the property transfer tax by the end of 2011 and expects to complete the devolution \nof the land and building tax by 2014. Significant supporting regulation in the form of a joint ministerial \ndecree between MOF and MOHA (Joint Ministerial Decree 53/2010) clarifies transfer of the property \ntransfer tax to regional governments, detailing the responsibilities of each ministry to ensure a \nsmooth transition. The effective decentralization of both taxes to regional governments is one of the \nmost important reform challenges facing the decentralization process and will require sustained \nreform efforts from the government and development partners. \n \n5.  Strengthened Management of Regional Reserves and Debt \n \n22.  Overall risk of fiscal instability from regional government financial liabilities was reduced with \nthe implementation of the debt management and financial analysis system of the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development for the management of regional debt. The system has been \noperating fully since 2010, providing useful data for the analysis of regional debt. The system \nreceives data from the accounts receivable system and a Microsoft Excel-based system that is used \nto manage on-lending of regional governments.  \n \n23.  The restructuring and rescheduling of nonperforming debts of state-owned water supply \ncompanies (PDAMs) is progressing adequately. Overall, Rp4.3 trillion of debt was restructured or \nrescheduled amounting to 58% of the total debt as of December 2010. Data from the Directorate \nGeneral of Treasury shows that of 164 PDAMs eligible for debt restructuring, 115 had prepared \nrestructuring or rescheduling plans for MOF consideration. Of these about 68 have passed through \nthe  two  required  committees  and  were  approved  by  MOF.  A  further  22  are  still  undergoing \nprocessing and may be finalized in late 2011. Some 25 plans were resent to the PDAMs for review \nand  resubmission,  and  the  Directorate  General  of  Treasury  of  MOF  expects  to  complete  the \napproval process of an additional 10 of these revisions. \n \n24.  The regulatory framework for subnational borrowing has been significantly improved with the \nrevised regulation on local government borrowing, which includes municipal bond issuance (GR \n30/2011). The City of Jakarta initiated the process of municipal bond issuance, and DGFB and the \nCapital Market and Financial Institution Supervisory Agency have approved two local regulation \ntemplates. The first defines procedures for issuing the bond and the second outlines procedures for \n                                                \n12 Incorrect Dekon are budgetary allocations still under the control of line ministries for functions devolved to regional \ngovernments. \n13 Analysis of expenditures by the Ministry of Environment, ADB\u2019s second pilot ministry, did not render any significant \ncases of incorrect Dekon. \n ", "     7   \nmanaging the bond. The dissemination of these templates to regional governments is an important \nstep in the provision of government support to municipal bond issuance. \n \n6.  Improved  Capacity  Development  for  Gender  Budgeting  and  Gender \nMainstreaming, Public Financial Management, and Accountability \n \n25.  Gender concerns are, for the first time, being incorporated in strategic policy formulation and \nbudget formulation processes. MOF has instructed line ministries to implement gender-responsive \nbudgeting in the budget proposals for 2010 and 2011, and a gender budget statement is now \nincluded in the annual budget documents. A draft manual offering guidance to regional governments \non  implementing  gender-responsive  budgeting  will  support  the  rollout  of  gender-responsive \nbudgeting to subnational governments. \n \n26.  The government will continue to invest in the training of regional government officers on \npublic financial management. Training for human resources and system development in regional \ngovernments, including the preparation of training materials, has increased, on average, by 25% \nover the last 3 years through MOHA and MOF. In addition, a financial management information \nsystem (FMIS) has been fully implemented in 53 regional governments; partially implemented in 41; \nand initiated in 25, with free software available for expansion to all regional governments. Work in \nthis  area  has  included  the  training  of  5,657  officials  in  FMIS  usage.  In  addition,  gender \nmainstreaming is being institutionalized for line ministry training through MOHA in coordination with \nMDWPC. \n \n27.  Time delays in publishing consolidated regional government financial information have been \nprogressively reduced. Budget approval information for regional governments is available for 100% \nof jurisdictions up to 2010, effectively reducing the delay in publication to one year. Publication of \nbudget realization data is also timely. The most recent web-published data indicates that close to \n100% of regional government reports for 2008 and around 60% of reports for 2009 are available, \ndisplaying good performance in this particular area of the policy matrix. \n \n28.  A  regional  government  performance  measurement  system  has  been  developed  with  a \ncentralized database fully functioning in 40 regional governments. The system was developed and \ntrialed in 40 regional governments. Information and implementation kits and the software package \n(which  runs  on  Microsoft  Excel)  have  now  been  provided  to  almost  all  regional  governments \nthroughout  the  country.  The  system  includes  gender-related  indicators  in  areas  like  female \nrepresentation in local authorities and targets for capacity building. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n29.  The government has requested a loan of $200 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft program loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication from ADB. \n \n30.  The size of the program is based on a number of factors required to support implementation \nof program reforms (Appendix 4). The key considerations include (i) the relative importance of the \nsector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program, and the leverage necessary \nto  counter  resistance  from  interest  groups;  (ii)  the  policy  adjustment  costs  incurred  by  the \n ", "8   \ngovernment and stakeholders in implementing and complying with reforms; and (iii) the need to \nconform to the overall financing requirement during the country partnership strategy period. ADB \nstaff estimate that the direct benefits of program reforms over the medium term are approximately \n$820 million to GDP (in 2011 prices). These economic benefits include (i) gains to local economies \nof  approximately  $410  million  arising  from  increased  state  budget  allocative  efficiency  due  to \nimprovements in the public financial management systems of regional governments, and (ii) gains of \nat least $410 million to the economy arising from efficiency improvements in collection of property \ntaxes that will be devolved to regional governments from 2011 to 2014. Other potential economic \ngains to  the  economy arising from fiscal  decentralization  are  difficult to quantify. In  particular, \nefficiency  gains  in  service  delivery  from  decentralizing  expenditure  assignments  could  be \nsubstantial. The policy adjustment costs to national and subnational governments are conservatively \nestimated as a discounted present value lump sum of about $310 million. These adjustment costs \ninclude the administrative, investment, and fiscal costs to the government in implementing the \nreforms and capacity development including strengthening regional FMIS systems, training staff in \nsubnational government offices, restructuring debt of the PDAMs, and developing databases and \nother coordination mechanisms. The reforms also have important distribution effects between the \nnational  and  regional  governments.  In  particular,  in  2011  the  devolution  of  property  taxes  will \ntransfer approximately $4.1 billion of national government budget revenue to regional governments. \nThe increased flow of funds will aim to address unfunded mandates for service delivery. Further, as \nown local revenue collection increases, pressure on additional central government transfers will \nreduce. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  DGFB (MOF) is the executing agency, and the relevant directorates of MOF, MOHA, and \nBAPPENAS  are  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  program.  A  local  government  finance  and \ngovernance reform steering committee (with an implementation committee), formed under the Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Program,  subprogram  1, 14  will  coordinate \nimplementation of the program reform actions. The implementation period extends from September \n2009 to August 2011. The steering committee is chaired by the director general of DGFB, and \nincludes MOHA and BAPPENAS officials as members. The program loan of $200 million will be \ndisbursed in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed  arrangements  between  the  government  and  ADB.15 The  reforms  supported  under  the \nprogram will be met through local currency counterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds. \nPrior to withdrawal, the government will nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all \nloan proceeds. The government will use its own procurement procedures for the procurement of \neligible items to be financed from the loan proceeds. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n32.  Through  its  efforts  on  overall  public  financial  management  reform,  the  government  is \nstrengthening the legal and regulatory architecture to achieve better fiscal synergy between national \nand regional governments. Current reforms emphasize the need for improved transparency on the \nallocation  of  fiscal  transfers  to  the  regions,  with  the  recent  introduction  of  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework and performance-based budgeting by the government.  In addition, the \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Loan and \nCluster for Subprogram 1 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance \nReform Program. Manila (Loan 2478-INO, for $350 million, approved on 4 December). \n15 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "     9   \ngovernment has taken important strides toward efficient financial management with the introduction \nof public procurement offices at national and subnational levels. Lastly, progress has been achieved \nin (i) disclosing relevant fiscal information to the public, specifically improving the transparency of the \nconsolidated general government financial statements; and (ii) strengthening the role of the external \naudit function. However, challenges remain, including the need to (i) improve internal controls in \nbudget execution by spending agencies; and (ii) complete the government financial management \ninformation system, which provides information for budget management at all levels of government. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and DGFB. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Reforms under the program are expected to assist the government in its poverty reduction \nagenda through three channels. First, the recent boost in regional government public spending from \nlarger fiscal transfers has contributed to economic growth in local economies and poverty reduction. \nADB staff estimate that the fiscal expansion from 2007 to 2010 could have reduced the number of \npeople living below the poverty line by 0.5%. Second, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of \ndelivering basic public services to the poor is believed to have contributed to poverty reduction. \nThird, decentralization of expenditure assignments combined with the shift in community-based \npoverty mapping and targeting has improved the effectiveness of the national government\u2019s poverty \nreduction programs. This is reflected in increased social spending (education and health) across \nmost districts. \n \n34.  Noticeable reductions in poverty since 2007 are reported in the resource-rich provinces in \nKalimantan, Riau, and other parts of Sumatra. Java and Bali also achieved a substantial reduction in \npoverty. The fiscal autonomy granted to subnational governments is expected to be exercised more \nefficiently, initially by those regions with better managerial capacity and with more solid economic \nbases. Nevertheless, significant poverty exists in large parts of eastern Indonesia and regional \nincome disparities have been persistent. Many of the poorer provinces have seen only modest \nreduction in poverty since 2002. The poorer provinces also tend to spend less on social sectors than \nmore advanced regions. Importantly, economic development in east Indonesia (measured by per \ncapita income) lags that of the leading regions of Indonesia (parts of Bali, Java, Kalimantan, and \nSumatra). Increased efforts are needed to accelerate development in lagging regions, strengthen \npro-poor elements of regional budgets, and improve public financial systems and governance.  \n \n35.  This  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  program  supports \neffective implementation of gender-responsive budgeting at all tiers of government. Gender budget \nstatements are now being included in annual budget statements. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The program will have (i) no adverse environmental impacts, (ii) no involuntary resettlement \nimpacts, and (iii) no impact on indigenous peoples. It is classified as category C for involuntary \nresettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  the  environment. The  program  is  a general  intervention \naimed at supporting sustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect \npositive effect on poverty reduction. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The program design will mitigate all risks by providing a strong broad-based governance \nframework, with transparency and accountability elements for central and regional governments. \nThe program has three potential risks (Table 1). \n ", "10  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak regional  This risk will be mitigated with improvements to (i) bottom\u2013up accountability through more efficient \ngovernment leadership  public financial management, (ii) improved vertical organization structures and hierarchical \nand capacity  responsibilities, (iii) accountability of regional governments to oversight and coordination agencies \nand to the public, (iv) accountability through the electoral process, and (v) the regional civil service. \nHorizontal imbalances  Improved analysis and transparency in intergovernmental financial flows will increase accountability \nbetween regions  and create a larger constituency in favor of further equalization. \nInefficient national policy  This risk has been mitigated by the participation of key stakeholders in formulating the NAPFD and \ncoordination  GSFD, the leadership role played by DGFB in policy coordination, and the participation of regional \ngovernments in annual national development planning meetings. \nDGFB = Directorate General of Fiscal Balance, GSFD = Grand Strategy for Fiscal Decentralization, NAPFD = National Action \nPlan for Fiscal Decentralization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n38.  The government and DGFB have assured ADB that implementation of the program will \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement. In addition to the standard \nassurances, the government has given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the \nloan agreement: \n(i)  The government will ensure that the local government finance and governance \nreform  steering  committee  previously  constituted  under  the  Local  Government \nFinance and Governance Reform Program, subprogram 1 will meet semiannually \nand if needed, on ad hoc basis, to (a) monitor progress of the program cluster, in \nparticular,  the  PPPF;  and  (b)  provide  guidance  and  direction  to  DGFB,  the \nimplementing agencies, and the relevant line ministries for PPPF implementation \nand future finance- and governance-related reforms. The local government finance \nand governance reform steering committee may invite ADB to participate in its \nmeetings as an observer. \n(ii)  The  government  will  ensure  that  a  gender-responsive  regional  government \nbudgeting  system  is  adopted  and  implemented  in  a  timely  manner,  and  that \nadequate resources are allocated for this purpose. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $200,000,000 \nto the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Second Local Government Finance and \nGovernance Reform Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of  \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n8 September 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources \nand/or Indicators with  Update on Status of  and/or Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Performance Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact        Assumptions \nMore efficient, effective,  Over 60.0% citizen  No new available data  GDS  Stronger bottom\u2013up \nand equitable regional  satisfaction with health and  from GDS since 2007    accountability with \ngovernment spending  education services (versus      improved public \n58.1% satisfaction rating for      financial \nhealth and 50.3% for      management and \neducation in 2007)      reporting \n      transparency \nLess than 15.0% of the  Percentage of poor is  BPS   \ntotal population is poor  13.33% in 2010    Stronger vertical \n(from 16.6% in 2007)      organization \n      structures and \n1 million more households  Total number of  BPS  hierarchical \ngain access to piped water  households served by  responsibilities \nconnection yearly, from a  water supply   \nbaseline of 9,449,505 in  establishments in 2010:  Increased \n2005  10,370,451  accountability \nthrough the electoral \nprocess \n \nRisk \nInsufficient \nleadership and \nownership in regional \ngovernments to \ntranslate institutional \ncapacity \nimprovements into \nbetter services and \nreduced poverty \nOutcome        Assumption \nImproved organizational  Increase in total DAK to  The DAK in 2011:  MOF reports  Growing political and \ncapacity of regional  0.80% of GDP by 2011  0.40% of GDP.    bureaucratic \ngovernments so that they  from a baseline of 0.46% in  Adjustment fund    momentum of \noperate in a more  2008, at the expense of  allocations to RG    reforms with \ntransparent, effective, and  incorrectly deconcentrated  increased from 0.10% of    emergence of reform \nefficient policy and legal  funds  GDP (2008) to 0.70% of    champions; policies \nenvironment for fiscal    GDP (2011)    are, therefore, not \ndecentralization, financial        expected to be \nmanagement, and service  Decrease in regional  Reserves to regional  MOF and Bank of  completely reversed, \ndelivery  government reserves in  GDP ratio went down  Indonesia reports  but flexibility for \nlocal bank accounts to  from 16.6% in 2008 to    changes must be \n2.5% of GDP or less by  13.2% in 2009.    maintained at the \nDecember 2010 from a  Local revenues from    margin. \nbaseline of 3.1% in  own sources = 17.9% of     \nNovember 2006  expenditures (up from    Risk \n  15.0% in 2008)    Diminished support \n    MOF database  for reforms from new \nGradual increase in shares  In 2010: health (8.8%),  governments \nof regional government  agriculture (2.0%), \nsector spending for health  infrastructure (17.0%), \n(7.0% of total regional  and environment and \nbudget in 2004), agriculture  special planning (2.0%). \n(4.0%), infrastructure  The share for \n(17.0%), and environment  government \nand special planning  administration spending \n(1.0%), at the expense of  is 35.0% due to \ngovernment administration  increased number of \nspending (32.0%)  local governments. \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources \nand/or Indicators with  Update on Status of  and/or Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Performance Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs        Assumptions \n1.
