The  program  will  support  government  efforts  to  improve  living \nstandards  and  local  service  delivery  by  implementing  an  efficient  and  equitable  system  of \nintergovernment fiscal relations. The reform priorities include efforts to improve the policy framework \nfor  fiscal  decentralization,  strengthen  the  capacity  of  regional  government  officials,  and  develop \nperformance-oriented management systems.1 \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nIndonesia has made significant progress implementing decentralization reforms. Since 2001, \nthe  government  has  effectively  devolved  key  expenditure  and  revenue  functions  to  regional \ngovernments;  by  2010  they  accounted  for  a  third  of  total  public  expenditure.  These  reforms  have \nhad positive impacts on improving governance in terms of increased local participation in the budget \nprocess,  greater  transparency,  and  accountability.  Some  evidence  indicates  that  decentralization \nhas  stimulated  economic  growth  in  local  economies,  at  least  in  the  medium  term.  It  has  also \ncontributed to the government\u2019s poverty reduction goals. Nevertheless, the government recognizes \nthat  fiscal  decentralization  is  still  in  its  early  stages  and  continues  to  refine  and  advance  its \ndecentralization reform agenda. \n \nImproved living standards are observed across the country, but significant challenges remain \n3. \nfor  inclusive  development.  As  the  country  sustains  high  economic  growth,  the  percentage  of  poor \npeople  in  Indonesia  has  fallen  from  around  16.6%  in  2007  to  13.3%  in  2010.2 However,  regional \ndisparities in terms of poverty rates and access to basic services continue. In 2010, Maluku province \nreported  a  poverty  rate  of  27.7%,  compared  with  3.5%  in  Jakarta  and  4.3%  in  Bali.  Inequalities \nextend to other human development dimensions. East Maluku reported a human development index \n(HDI)3 of  70.96  in  2009,  well  below  the  Jakarta  HDI  of  77.36.  The  percentage  of  households  with \nimproved  sanitation  in  Yogyakarta  is  more  than  75%,  compared  with  around  25%  in  Papua  and \nKalimantan  Tengah.  At  least  12  provinces  report  that  fewer  than  70%  of  their  households  have \naccess  to  electricity;  about  12  provinces  report  almost  full  coverage.  Future  progress  in  reducing \npoverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  will  largely  depend  on  improved  access \nto, and quality of, basic services delivered to the local population. \n \n4. \nIndonesia\u2019s  long-term  decentralization policy  objectives are  to  improve the delivery  of  basic \nservices and infrastructure to local communities across the country (National Action Plan for Fiscal \nDecentralization [NAPFD] 2010\u20132014). Since implementation of \u201cbig bang\u201d decentralization reforms \nin  2001,  regional  governments  are  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  most  basic  services.  Thus, \nimproving the efficiency and equity of the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations is essential to \nachieve further gains in poverty reduction. The government aims to distribute available financing to \nregional  governments  to  ensure  comparable  coverage  of  basic  services  across  the  country.  Since \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1; the list of linked documents is in Appendix 2; the development \npolicy  letter  is  in  Appendix  3;  and  the  policy  matrix,  listing  the  triggers  and  milestones  defined  for  this  program,  and \nincluding the postprogram partnership framework, is in Appendix 4. \n\n2  Badan Pusat Statistik. 2011. Indonesia Poverty Data (http://dds.bps.go.id/eng/aboutus.php?tabel=1&id_subyek=23) \n3  HDI  is  a  composite  statistic  used  to  rank  provinces  by  level  of  \"human  development\"  and  separate  \"very  high  human \ndevelopment,\"  \"high  human  development,\"  \"medium  human  development,\"  and  \"low  human  development\"  provinces. \nThe  Center  Bureau  of  Statistics  prepares  the  provincial  HDI  in  Indonesia.  The  statistics  comprise  data  on  life \nexpectancy, education, and per-capita gross national income (as an indicator of standard of living or income) collected \nby subnational governments. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2003,  ADB  has  been  actively  supporting  fiscal  decentralization  with  a  combination  of  technical \nassistance (TA) and program and project loans.4 \n\n \n5. \nThe  last  decade  of  decentralization  reforms  has  transformed  Indonesia\u2019s  service  delivery \nsystems.  The  524  subnational  governments  (33  provinces  and  491  districts)  currently  account  for \nabout  33%  of  total  public  expenditure,  up  from  barely  7%  in  2000.  The  reforms  launched  in  2001 \ninvolved  a  massive  delegation  of  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  public  services  and  the \nreassignment  of  two-thirds  of  central  government  civil  servants  and  more  than  16,000  service \ndelivery  facilities  to  regional  governments.  Ensuring  an  efficient  assignment  of  expenditure \nresponsibilities to subnational governments is a long-term process requiring regular monitoring and \nreview. \n \n6. \nLocal  service  delivery  is  mostly  financed  with  central  government  grants,  with  growing \ncontributions from local revenue and borrowing. Currently, the largest unconditional grant available \nto regional governments (the General Allocation Fund [DAU]) accounts, on average, for 50% of total \nsubnational government revenues. The provincial and regional government share of revenues from \nextractive  industries  (the  dana  bagi  hasil  [revenue  sharing])  represents  17%  of  their  revenues;  an \nadditional 7% is accounted for by the infrastructure development grant (the Specific Allocation Fund \n[DAK]).  Total  grants  to  subnational  governments  have  more  than  doubled  since  2005,  from  an \nestimated  Rp150  trillion  to  around  Rp350  trillion  in  2010.  Local  revenue,  from  limited  taxes  and \ncharges,  represented  about  16%  of  total  subnational  government  revenue.  However,  recent \nassignments  of  new  sources  of  revenue  to  subnational  governments  are  likely  to  increase  the \nimportance  of  this  building  block  of  subnational financing. The government  has taken  a  cautionary \napproach  to  the  development  of  subnational  borrowing  powers.  As  a  result,  total  outstanding \nsubnational debt was reportedly just around 0.15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. \n \n7. \nRationalizing  criteria  for  new  local  government  formation.  From  1999  to  2008,  as  a \nconsequence  of  previously  repressed  demands  for  regional  autonomy,  seven  new  provinces  and \nabout 190 new regional governments were created. The creation of new local governments requires \nthe  application  of  sound  technical  criteria.  On  that  basis,  the  government  is  reviewing  the  current \nregulatory  framework  to  include  minimum  population  and  administrative  capacity  requirements, \ntogether  with  adequate  assessments  of  local  fiscal  capacity,  prior  to  granting  new  jurisdictional \nstatus.  In  addition,  the  design  of  grants  and  revenue-sharing  mechanisms  is  being  evaluated  to \navoid introducing perverse incentives to new government formation. \n\n \n8. \nMainstreaming  gender  in  policy  and  budget  formulation.  Policy  formulation  and \nregulatory developments for fiscal decentralization continue to incorporate gender considerations. In \naddition,  budgetary  allocations  at  all  levels  of  government  are  starting  to  reflect  the  importance \nendowed  to  gender  aspects  of  strategic  policy  formulation.  The  government  has  taken  several \nimportant steps, but the rollout of gender-sensitive budget formulation to regional governments is the \nnext critical challenge. \n \n9. \nNew  approach  to  decentralization.  Earlier  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to \ndecentralization in Indonesia assisted the development of the policy and institutional framework for \nreforms, including the creation of the Directorate General for Fiscal Balance (DGFB) at the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF), the definition of clearer expenditure assignments (e.g., issuance of Government \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Program  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Sector \nDevelopment  Program.  Manila  (Loans  2192-INO  and  2193-INO  for  $330  million);  and  ADB.  2008.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster and Loan for Subprogram 1 to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program.  Manila (Loan \n2478-INO for $350 million). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nRegulation 38/2007), and the enhanced equalizing power of the system of intergovernmental grants \n(with the elimination of the \u201chold harmless\u201d clause for the DAU for instance). The draft ADB 2011\u2013\n2015 country strategy and program for Indonesia identifies fiscal decentralization as key to efficient \npublic  service  delivery,  and  essential  for  more  inclusive  growth  and  improved  living  standards.  As \nthe  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  in  Indonesia  matures,  and  regional  governments \nadopt  the  central  government  procurement  process,  future  ADB  support  in  this  area  will  likely  be \nmore targeted to specific policy areas such as the devolution of the land and building tax. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  program  is  more  efficient,  effective,  and  equitable  regional \ngovernment  spending.  The  expected  outcome  is  improved  organizational  capacity  of  regional \ngovernments,  which  operate  in  a  more  transparent,  effective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal \nenvironment  for  fiscal  decentralization,  financial  management,  and  service  delivery.  The  latter  is \nfacilitated  via  efficient  local  government  support  systems,  human  resource  capacity,  and  system \ndevelopment. \n \nC. \n \n11 \nThe  program  supports  government\u2019s  efforts  in  six  core  reform  areas:  (i)  strengthening \nmanagement  and  coordination  of  fiscal  decentralization;  (ii)  clarifying  regional  administration \narrangements to improve services and accountability; (iii) enhancing equalization, predictability, and \ntransparency  in release  of  fiscal  transfers  and shared  revenue;  (iv)  reducing  dependency  on  fiscal \ntransfers  by  developing  more  buoyant  sources  of  local  revenue;  (v)  strengthening  management  of \nregional  reserves  and  debt;  and  (vi)  improving  capacity  development  for  gender  budgeting  and \ngender  mainstreaming,  public  financial  management,  and  accountability.  The  program  is  fully \naligned with the decentralization goals defined under the NAPFD. \n \nThe report and recommendation of the President for subprogram 1 of the Local Government \n12. \nFinance and Governance Reform 2 identified 14 policy triggers for subprogram 2 (footnote 4). In the \nprocess  of  assessing  implementation  progress,  the  government  proposed  four  additional  triggers \n(Appendix  12):  the  implementation  of  gender  responsive  budgeting,  strengthening  oversight  and \ncoordinating role of provincial governors, improved transparency in DAU allocation, and the starting \nof devolution of property transfer tax to the region. All 58 measures (18 triggers and 40 milestones) \nincluded in the program\u2019s policy matrix were accomplished by the end of August 2011 (Appendix 4). \nThe  immediate  and  medium-term  challenges  are  briefly  outlined  in  the  post  program  partnership \nframework  (PPPF)  in  the  program\u2019s  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4).  The  PPPF  reflects  the  main \nrecommendations from ADB\u2019s  special evaluation study5 and: (i) advocates for continued support to \nthe  development  of  the  policy  framework  and  institution  building  (with  a  particular  emphasis  on \ndemand-side  aspects  of  decentralization),  (ii)  identifies  government  priorities  for  reform  and \nemphasizes  needed  improvements  to  the  policy  coordination  framework,  and  (iii)  has  been \ndiscussed with major development partners.6 \n \n\n1. \n\nStrengthened Management and Coordination of Fiscal Decentralization \n\n \n13. \nSubstantial  progress  has  been  achieved  in  the  review  and  completion  of  the  policy  and \nregulatory framework for fiscal decentralization, including finalization of the draft Grand Strategy for \nFiscal Decentralization (GSFD) and the NAPFD 2010\u20132014. The GSFD has been used to set long-\nterm  directions  for  fiscal  decentralization,  influencing  draft  amendments  to  Law  33  on  Fiscal \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010. Special Evaluation Study: Asian Development Bank Support for Decentralization in Indonesia. Manila. \n6  The  proposed  project  will  be  supported  by  an  associated  capacity  development  TA  for  Second  Local  Government \n\nFinance and Governance Reform Program, which is being separately processed for expected approval in 2011. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nin  order \n\nBalance. 7 The  policy  framework  for  decentralization  has  been  strengthened  with  two  additional \nthe  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN)  2010\u20132014;  and  \ncomponents:  (i) \n(ii) completion of academic papers for the preparation of amendments to Law 328 and Law 33. The \nlatter  documents  (for  which  female  representation  was  ensured  in  the  drafting  teams)  have \nmainstreamed  gender  equity  during  their  formulation,  a  process  facilitated  by  the  Ministry  for  the \nDevelopment of Women and Protection of Children (MDWPC). Future challenges, as outlined in the \nPPPF,  include  the  deepening  of  regular  consultation  mechanisms  with  subnational  governments, \ncivil  society  organizations,  and  private  sector  representatives \nto  assess  policy \nimplementation and enrich dialogue among institutions. \n \n14. \nDGFB  was established as  the  leading  national agency for fiscal  decentralization reforms. It \nhas  led  consultative  mechanisms  for  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  with  government  agencies  and \nbeen  largely  in  charge  of  aid  coordination.  The  latter  included  the  preparation,  through  the  tim \nasistensi (assistance team), of the GSFD, and the ongoing review of Law 33. DGFB also co-chairs \nmeetings  of  the  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council.  It  has  provided  leadership  to  ADB\u2019s  Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Program  (it  has  been  the  executing  agency  for \nseveral ADB TA projects)9 and other development partner programs,10 and has coordinated through \nformal  and  informal  arrangements  with  key  central  ministries  and  regional  governments.  DGFB \nprovides regular information on fiscal decentralization matters, especially through a chapter on fiscal \ndecentralization  in  the  Financial  Notes  for  the  2011  Annual  Budget.  Decentralization  policy  design \nand  coordination  remains  a  challenge.  The  current  government  regulatory  review  is  assessing  the \ncentral government\u2019s institutional framework for policy coordination  and is reconsidering the role of \nall  relevant  stakeholders.  Of  particular  importance  will  be  the  definition  of  the  role  of  provincial \nadministrations as a key element of the system of central\u2013subnational fiscal relations. \n \n\n2. \n\nClarified  Regional  Administration  Arrangements  to  Improve  Services  and \nAccountability \n\n \n15. \nThe  effort  devoted  to  the  refinement  of  expenditure  assignments  in  Indonesia  has  been \nconstant  and  significant.  The  framework  for  the  definition  and  review  of  functional  assignments  is \nnow  complete  with  four  main  elements:  (i)  Law  32  on  Regional  Autonomy;  (ii)  Government \nRegulation  38/2007  dealing  with  functional  assignments  across  tiers  of  government;  (iii)  standard,  \nprosedur,  dan  kriteria  (norms,  standards,  procedures,  and  criteria)  for  service  delivery  by  line \nministries;  and  (iv)  the  standard  prosedur  minimum  (minimum  service  standards).  The  Dewan \nPerwakilan  Rakyat  (House  of  Representatives)  is  scheduled  to  discuss  amendments  to  Law  32, \nincluding a review of expenditure assignments by tiers of government, in 2011. Upon approval, such \namendments  will  form  the  core  of  the  revision  of  GR  38/2007.  About  40  norms,  standards, \nprocedures, and criteria have already been completed by key social sectors including education and \nhealth,  and  the  process  to  clarify  responsibilities  in  service  delivery  will  continue  in  the  remaining \nministries over the next few years. Furthermore, 13 ministries11 have developed minimum standard \n\n                                                \n7  Law 33 importantly outlines the system of regional financing, including transfer mechanisms from the central to regional \n\ngovernments. \n\n8  Among  other  aspects,  Law  32  provides  a  first  statement  of  expenditure  responsibilities  by  tier  of  government  and \n\nregulates procedures for new regional government creation. \n\n9  ADB. 2008.

A moratorium on the processing of applications \nfor new regions has been in place since mid-2009 and pending further legal reforms will remain in \neffect until 2014, as stated in the RPJMN for 2010\u20132014. Draft amendments to Law 32 incorporate \nsound criteria to guide the processing of applications for the creation of new jurisdictions. In addition, \nthe  recently  approved  Desain  Besar  Penataan  Daerah  (Grand  Design  on  Regional  Autonomy) \nproposes  tightening  the  administrative  procedures  for  establishing  new  regions,  including  a  3-year \nevaluation period prior to granting local government status. \n \n17. \nThe government has taken important steps to strengthen the oversight and coordinating role \nof provincial governors in the framework of intergovernmental fiscal relations. They have revised the \ngovernment regulation on the roles and responsibilities of provincial governor to strengthen the role \nof  governor  (Government  Regulation  23/2011);  issued  a  joint  circulation  letter  between  MOF,  the \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA), and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) on \nthe  implementation  of  the  GR  23/2011;  and,  reflected  changes  in  the  desired  role  of  provincial \ngovernors in the draft amendments to Law 32/2004. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhanced  Equalization,  Predictability,  and  Transparency  in  Release  of  Fiscal \nTransfers and Shared Revenue \n\n \n18. \nThe  equalization  potential  of  the  DAU  has  been  improved.  Presidential  Decree  5/2010 \n(RPJMN 2010\u20132014) instructs the government to provide greater flexibility in the allocation of DAU \nfunds  by  delinking  wage  payments  from  DAU  allocations,  thus  releasing  additional  resources  for \npoorer regions. In practice, the government has pegged the amount devoted to wage payments from \nthe  DAU  to  below  50%  of  the  total  allocation.  The  process  will  need  to  be  completed  with \namendments  to  Law  33,  legally  delinking  the  wage  component  from  the  DAU  formula.  Improved \ntransparency in DAU allocation is now achieved by the recent publication of the national formula and \nweights  used  for  the  distribution  of  the  DAU  to  provinces  in  the  annual  supplementary  budget \ndocuments.  Future  reforms  should  consider  removing  adjustments  that  make  grant  allocation \ndiscretionary, thereby improving overall effectiveness of public expenditure. \n \n19. \nPredictability in fiscal transfers is improved with the progressive incorporation of a system of \nforward estimates for all major grants into the budget formulation process. Although their importance \nvaries  greatly  across  jurisdictions,  on  average  central  government  transfers  (including  grants  and \nrevenue sharing from national taxes on resource industries) account for more than 80% of regional \ngovernment  revenue.  With  limited  discretionary  power  over  their  own  revenue  sources,  regional \ngovernments  require  predictability  over  the  medium-term  on the  assignment  of central government \ntransfers (both in terms of regular financial flows and the stability  of the estimated annual amounts \nreceived).  Acknowledging  the  importance  of  adequate  fiscal  information,  the  new  budget  manual \nrequires  the  implementation  of  forward  estimates  for  3  years.  The  2009  national  budget  already \ncontained  forward  estimates  of  transfers  to  regions  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  Further,  MOF  has \nincluded nominal forward estimates for each major transfer as part of the formulation of its medium-\nterm  expenditure  framework.  Future  work  will  require  improving  available  annual  budgetary \ninformation  of  regional  governments  to  allow  for  effective  implementation  of  the  RPJMN  for  2010\u2013\n2014. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n20. \nEfficiency  in  regional  government  budgetary  appropriations  has  been  enhanced.  Significant \n\u201cincorrectly\u201d  deconcentrated  expenditures12 were  identified  for  the  Ministry  of  National  Education \n(approximately  Rp20  trillion  in  2008  values). 13  The  main  transgressing  education  program  (the \nSchool  Operational  Assistance  Program,  which  constitutes  more  than  50%  of  the  Ministry  of \nNational  Education  deconcentrated  expenditure)  was  moved  from  government  deconcentrated \nfunding  to  alternative  funding,  and  thus  devolved  to  the  regional  governments.  This  has  improved \nthe discretionary expenditure power of regional administrations from conditional education transfers. \n \n\n4. \n\nReduced  Dependency  on  Fiscal  Transfers  by  Developing  More  Buoyant \nSources of Local Revenue \n\n \n21. \nDuring  the  program,  the  government  assigned  important  revenue  sources  to  subnational \ngovernments, progressing beyond the originally defined policy goals in this area of reform. Gradual \ndevolution of the land and building tax and the property transfer tax started in January 2011, upon \nenactment of Law 28/2009 on Regional Government Revenues and Charges. The government plans \nto fully devolve the property transfer tax by the end of 2011 and expects to complete the devolution \nof the land and building tax by 2014. Significant supporting regulation in the form of a joint ministerial \ndecree between MOF and MOHA (Joint Ministerial Decree 53/2010) clarifies transfer of the property \ntransfer  tax  to  regional  governments,  detailing  the  responsibilities  of  each  ministry  to  ensure  a \nsmooth transition. The effective decentralization of both taxes to regional governments is one of the \nmost  important  reform  challenges  facing  the  decentralization  process  and  will  require  sustained \nreform efforts from the government and development partners. \n \n\n5. \n\nStrengthened Management of Regional Reserves and Debt \n\n \n22. \nOverall risk of fiscal instability from regional government financial liabilities was reduced with \nthe  implementation  of  the  debt  management  and  financial  analysis  system  of  the  United  Nations \nConference on Trade and Development for the management of regional debt. The system has been \noperating  fully  since  2010,  providing  useful  data  for  the  analysis  of  regional  debt.  The  system \nreceives data from the accounts receivable system and a Microsoft Excel-based system that is used \nto manage on-lending of regional governments.  \n \nThe  restructuring  and  rescheduling  of  nonperforming  debts  of  state-owned  water  supply \n23. \ncompanies  (PDAMs)  is  progressing  adequately.  Overall,  Rp4.3  trillion  of  debt  was  restructured  or \nrescheduled  amounting  to  58%  of  the  total  debt  as  of  December  2010.  Data  from  the  Directorate \nGeneral  of  Treasury  shows  that  of  164  PDAMs  eligible  for  debt  restructuring,  115  had  prepared \nrestructuring or rescheduling plans for MOF consideration. Of these about 68 have passed through \nthe  two  required  committees  and  were  approved  by  MOF.  A  further  22  are  still  undergoing \nprocessing and may be finalized in late 2011. Some 25 plans were resent to the PDAMs for review \nand  resubmission,  and  the  Directorate  General  of  Treasury  of  MOF  expects  to  complete  the \napproval process of an additional 10 of these revisions. \n \n24. \nThe regulatory framework for subnational borrowing has been significantly improved with the \nrevised  regulation  on  local  government  borrowing,  which  includes  municipal  bond  issuance  (GR \n30/2011). The City of Jakarta initiated the process of municipal bond issuance, and DGFB and the \nCapital  Market  and  Financial  Institution  Supervisory  Agency  have  approved  two  local  regulation \ntemplates. The first defines procedures for issuing the bond and the second outlines procedures for \n\n                                                \n12 Incorrect  Dekon  are  budgetary  allocations  still  under  the  control  of  line  ministries  for  functions  devolved  to  regional \n\n13 Analysis  of  expenditures  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  ADB\u2019s  second  pilot  ministry,  did  not  render  any  significant \n\ngovernments. \n\ncases of incorrect Dekon. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nmanaging the bond. The dissemination of these templates to  regional governments is an important \nstep in the provision of government support to municipal bond issuance. \n \n\n6. \n\nImproved  Capacity  Development \nMainstreaming, Public Financial Management, and Accountability \n\nfor  Gender  Budgeting  and  Gender \n\n \n25. \nGender concerns are, for the first time, being incorporated in strategic policy formulation and \nbudget  formulation  processes.  MOF  has  instructed  line  ministries  to  implement  gender-responsive \nbudgeting  in  the  budget  proposals  for  2010  and  2011,  and  a  gender  budget  statement  is  now \nincluded in the annual budget documents. A draft manual offering guidance to regional governments \non  implementing  gender-responsive  budgeting  will  support  the  rollout  of  gender-responsive \nbudgeting to subnational governments. \n \nThe  government  will  continue  to  invest  in  the  training  of  regional  government  officers  on \n26. \npublic  financial  management.  Training  for  human  resources  and  system  development  in  regional \ngovernments,  including  the  preparation  of  training  materials,  has  increased,  on  average,  by  25% \nover  the  last  3  years  through  MOHA  and  MOF.  In  addition,  a  financial  management  information \nsystem (FMIS) has been fully implemented in 53 regional governments; partially implemented in 41; \nand initiated  in 25,  with  free  software  available for  expansion  to all  regional  governments. Work  in \nthis  area  has  included  the  training  of  5,657  officials  in  FMIS  usage.  In  addition,  gender \nmainstreaming is being institutionalized for line ministry training through MOHA in coordination with \nMDWPC. \n \n27. \nTime delays in publishing consolidated regional government financial information have been \nprogressively reduced. Budget approval information for regional governments is available for 100% \nof  jurisdictions  up  to  2010,  effectively  reducing  the  delay  in  publication  to  one  year.  Publication  of \nbudget  realization  data  is  also  timely.  The  most  recent  web-published  data  indicates  that  close  to \n100%  of  regional  government  reports  for  2008  and  around  60%  of  reports  for  2009  are  available, \ndisplaying good performance in this particular area of the policy matrix. \n\nProgram Costs and Financing \n\n \n28. \nA  regional  government  performance  measurement  system  has  been  developed  with  a \ncentralized  database fully  functioning  in  40  regional  governments. The  system  was  developed  and \ntrialed  in  40  regional  governments.  Information  and  implementation  kits  and  the  software  package \n(which  runs  on  Microsoft  Excel)  have  now  been  provided  to  almost  all  regional  governments \nthroughout  the  country.  The  system  includes  gender-related  indicators  in  areas  like  female \nrepresentation in local authorities and targets for capacity building. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe government has requested a loan of $200 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft program loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication from ADB. \n \nThe size of the program is based on a number of factors required to support implementation \n30. \nof  program reforms  (Appendix  4).  The key  considerations include (i) the  relative  importance of the \nsector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program, and the leverage necessary \nto  counter  resistance  from  interest  groups;  (ii)  the  policy  adjustment  costs  incurred  by  the \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ngovernment  and  stakeholders  in  implementing  and  complying  with  reforms;  and  (iii)  the  need  to \nconform  to  the  overall  financing  requirement  during  the  country  partnership  strategy  period.  ADB \nstaff  estimate  that  the direct  benefits  of  program  reforms  over  the medium  term  are  approximately \n$820 million to GDP (in 2011 prices). These economic benefits include (i) gains to local economies \nof  approximately  $410  million  arising  from  increased  state  budget  allocative  efficiency  due  to \nimprovements in the public financial management systems of regional governments, and (ii) gains of \nat  least  $410 million  to  the  economy  arising  from  efficiency  improvements  in  collection  of  property \ntaxes  that  will  be  devolved  to  regional  governments  from  2011  to  2014.  Other  potential  economic \ngains  to  the  economy  arising  from  fiscal  decentralization  are  difficult  to  quantify.  In  particular, \nefficiency  gains  in  service  delivery  from  decentralizing  expenditure  assignments  could  be \nsubstantial. The policy adjustment costs to national and subnational governments are conservatively \nestimated  as  a  discounted  present  value  lump  sum  of  about  $310 million. These  adjustment  costs \ninclude  the  administrative,  investment,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the  government  in  implementing  the \nreforms  and  capacity  development  including  strengthening  regional  FMIS  systems,  training  staff  in \nsubnational  government  offices,  restructuring  debt  of  the  PDAMs,  and  developing  databases  and \nother  coordination  mechanisms.  The  reforms  also  have  important  distribution  effects  between  the \nnational  and  regional  governments.  In  particular,  in  2011  the  devolution  of  property  taxes  will \ntransfer approximately $4.1 billion of national government budget revenue to regional governments. \nThe increased flow of funds will aim to address unfunded mandates for service delivery. Further, as \nown  local  revenue  collection  increases,  pressure  on  additional  central  government  transfers  will \nreduce. \n \nE. \n \nDGFB  (MOF)  is  the  executing  agency,  and  the  relevant  directorates  of  MOF,  MOHA,  and \n31. \nBAPPENAS  are  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  program.  A  local  government  finance  and \ngovernance reform steering committee (with an implementation committee), formed under the Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Program,  subprogram  1, 14  will  coordinate \nimplementation of the program reform actions. The implementation period extends from September \n2009  to  August  2011.  The  steering  committee  is  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  DGFB,  and \nincludes  MOHA  and  BAPPENAS  officials  as  members.  The  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be \ndisbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed  arrangements  between  the  government  and  ADB. 15  The  reforms  supported  under  the \nprogram  will  be  met  through  local  currency  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds. \nPrior to withdrawal, the government will nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all \nloan  proceeds.  The  government  will  use  its  own  procurement  procedures  for  the  procurement  of \neligible items to be financed from the loan proceeds. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nThrough  its  efforts  on  overall  public  financial  management  reform,  the  government  is \nstrengthening the legal and regulatory architecture to achieve better fiscal synergy between national \nand  regional governments.  Current  reforms  emphasize the  need for  improved  transparency  on the \nallocation  of  fiscal  transfers  to  the  regions,  with  the  recent  introduction  of  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  performance-based  budgeting  by  the  government.    In  addition,  the \n                                                \n14 ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Program  Loan  and \nCluster  for  Subprogram  1  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance \nReform Program. Manila (Loan 2478-INO, for $350 million, approved on 4 December). \n\n15 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ngovernment has taken important strides toward efficient financial management with the introduction \nof public procurement offices at national and subnational levels. Lastly, progress has been achieved \nin (i) disclosing relevant fiscal information to the public, specifically improving the transparency of the \nconsolidated general government financial statements; and (ii) strengthening the role of the external \naudit  function.  However,  challenges  remain,  including  the  need  to  (i)  improve  internal  controls  in \nbudget  execution  by  spending  agencies;  and  (ii)  complete  the  government  financial  management \ninformation system, which provides information for budget management at all levels of government. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and DGFB. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nReforms  under  the  program  are  expected  to  assist  the  government  in  its  poverty  reduction \nagenda through three channels. First, the recent boost in regional government public spending from \nlarger fiscal transfers has contributed to economic growth in local economies and poverty reduction. \nADB staff estimate that the fiscal expansion from 2007 to 2010 could have reduced the number of \npeople living below the poverty line by 0.5%. Second, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of \ndelivering  basic  public  services  to  the  poor  is  believed  to  have  contributed  to  poverty  reduction. \nThird,  decentralization  of  expenditure  assignments  combined  with  the  shift  in  community-based \npoverty mapping and targeting has improved the effectiveness of the national government\u2019s poverty \nreduction  programs.  This  is  reflected  in  increased  social  spending  (education  and  health)  across \nmost districts. \n \n34. \nNoticeable  reductions  in  poverty  since  2007  are  reported  in  the  resource-rich  provinces  in \nKalimantan, Riau, and other parts of Sumatra. Java and Bali also achieved a substantial reduction in \npoverty. The fiscal autonomy granted to subnational governments is expected to be exercised more \nefficiently,  initially  by  those  regions  with  better  managerial  capacity  and  with  more  solid  economic \nbases.  Nevertheless,  significant  poverty  exists  in  large  parts  of  eastern  Indonesia  and  regional \nincome  disparities  have  been  persistent.  Many  of  the  poorer  provinces  have  seen  only  modest \nreduction in poverty since 2002. The poorer provinces also tend to spend less on social sectors than \nmore  advanced  regions.  Importantly,  economic  development  in  east  Indonesia  (measured  by  per \ncapita  income)  lags  that  of  the  leading  regions  of  Indonesia  (parts  of  Bali,  Java,  Kalimantan,  and \nSumatra).  Increased  efforts  are  needed  to  accelerate  development  in  lagging  regions,  strengthen \npro-poor elements of regional budgets, and improve public financial systems and governance.  \n \n35. \nThis  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  program  supports \neffective implementation of gender-responsive budgeting at all tiers of government. Gender budget \nstatements are now being included in annual budget statements. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nThe program will have (i) no adverse environmental impacts, (ii) no involuntary resettlement \nimpacts,  and  (iii)  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  It  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  the  environment.  The  program  is  a  general  intervention \naimed at supporting sustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect \npositive effect on poverty reduction. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nThe  program  design  will  mitigate  all  risks  by  providing  a  strong  broad-based  governance \nframework,  with  transparency  and  accountability  elements  for  central  and  regional  governments. \nThe program has three potential risks (Table 1). \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks \nWeak regional \ngovernment leadership \nand capacity \n\nHorizontal imbalances \nbetween regions \nInefficient national policy \ncoordination \n\nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThis risk will be mitigated with improvements to (i) bottom\u2013up accountability through more efficient \npublic financial management, (ii) improved vertical organization structures and hierarchical \nresponsibilities, (iii) accountability of regional governments to oversight and coordination agencies \nand to the public, (iv) accountability through the electoral process, and (v) the regional civil service. \nImproved analysis and transparency in intergovernmental financial flows will increase accountability \nand create a larger constituency in favor of further equalization. \nThis risk has been mitigated by the participation of key stakeholders in formulating the NAPFD and \nGSFD, the leadership role played by DGFB in policy coordination, and the participation of regional \ngovernments in annual national development planning meetings. \n\nDGFB = Directorate General of Fiscal Balance, GSFD = Grand Strategy for Fiscal Decentralization, NAPFD = National Action \nPlan for Fiscal Decentralization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe  government  and  DGFB  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program  will \n38. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement. In addition to the standard \nassurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in the \nloan agreement: \n(i) \n\nThe  government  will  ensure  that  the  local  government  finance  and  governance \nreform  steering  committee  previously  constituted  under  the  Local  Government \nFinance  and  Governance  Reform  Program,  subprogram  1  will  meet  semiannually \nand if needed, on ad hoc basis, to (a) monitor progress of the program cluster, in \nparticular,  the  PPPF;  and  (b)  provide  guidance  and  direction  to  DGFB,  the \nimplementing  agencies,  and  the  relevant  line  ministries  for  PPPF  implementation \nand future finance- and governance-related reforms.
