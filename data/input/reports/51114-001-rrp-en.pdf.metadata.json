The  program  aims to  enhance access  to  sustainable \nand modern energy services in the target regions as envisioned in PLN\u2019s Electricity Power Supply \nBusiness  Plan  (RUPTL),  2019\u20132028,  which  will  improve  connectivity  and  help  the  regions\u2019 \nresponse to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts.5 The program also addresses a key priority \nof the government\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020\u20132024 to stimulate \nmore inclusive growth with a focus on Eastern Indonesia.6 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \n\nProgress and challenges. Indonesia\u2019s economy is the world\u2019s eighth largest in terms of \npurchasing  power  parity  and  has  doubled  in  size  since  2000.  The  decline  in  the  poverty  rate \n(19.1% in 2000 to 9.7% in 2018) has been remarkable, with 13.1 million people lifted out of poverty \nin 18 years albeit at risk of being reversed by COVID-19 impact. However, growth has been largely \ncentered  around  Java,  and  regional  disparities  remain  stark. 7  In  Eastern  Indonesia,  poor \ninfrastructure\u2014for energy, transport, and communications\u2014constrains its high growth potential. \n \n\n \n\nNational priorities. Expanded electrification, with a priority on regions outside Java, is an \nimportant  element  of  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  plan.  The  plan  includes \nincreasing  (i)  the  electrification  ratio  from  89%  in  2016  to  near  100%  by  2024,  (ii)  the  power \ngeneration capacity from 56.5 gigawatts in 2018 to 112.2 gigawatts in 2028, and (iii) the share of \nrenewable energy in the national energy mix from 13% in 2016 to 23% in 2025.8 PLN is the sole \n\n \n\n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA).

The  government  has \nundertaken several reform measures, including (i) expanding the role of the private sector and \nimproving  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  adjusting  tariffs  to  better  reflect  costs  and  initiating \nperformance-based measures to reduce state subsidy requirements, and (iii) strengthening PLN\u2019s \ngovernance and financial capacity to undertake the aggressive infrastructure investment plan.9 \nIndependent  power  producers  are  expected  to  account  for  75%  of  new  power  capacity,  with \n$57.5 billion of private sector financing, while PLN needs sovereign funding support for electricity \ngrid development to fulfill its public service obligations, particularly in the outer provinces where \ncost recovery is challenged by tariff affordability. The government\u2019s approach balances the need \nfor reforms  to  boost  efficiency  and  service  quality  while  striving  to  achieve  universal  electricity \naccess  with  a  priority  on  Eastern Indonesia,  which  poses  the  biggest  challenge  because  of  its \nvast and isolated geography and fragmented power grids. \n \n\n \n\nADB  support.  The  programmatic  support  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nEastern  Indonesia  in  the  energy  sector  includes  (i)  policy  and  regulatory  support  through  the \nSustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program  policy-based  loan, 10  (ii)  the  Electricity  Grid \nDevelopment  Program  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program for  Sulawesi  and  Nusa  Tenggara \n(footnote  4),  (iii)  wind  and  solar  renewable  energy  projects  in  Sulawesi  and  Nusa  Tenggara \nthrough  nonsovereign  operations,11 (iv)  a  proposed  sector  project  for  small-  to  medium-scale \nnatural gas-fired power plants with pilot gas\u2013solar hybrid systems, and (v) other complementary \nprojects and RBL programs.12, The program includes incentives to expand the use of renewable \nsources from both public and private sector investments and, together with other ADB support in \nthe sector, will help enhance access to sustainable energy services, consistent with Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7 of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and the Paris \nAgreement  on  climate  change. 13  These  operations  are  consistent  with  and  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda and efforts to strengthen governance and institutional capacity. \n \nB. \n \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\nHouseholds  classified  as  \u201cnot  electrified\u201d  or  \u201cpoorly  electrified\u201d  account  for  56%  of  all \nhouseholds in Papua, 15% in West Papua, 20% in both Maluku and North Maluku, 28% in Central \nKalimantan, 18% in North Kalimantan, and 21% in West Kalimantan, versus a national average \nof 4%.14 These areas are mainly serviced, if at all, by diesel-fired generators, which are inefficient, \npolluting,  and  expensive.  Limited  access  to  electricity  compounds  the  broader  development \n\n \n\n9  Government subsidies, which include a public service obligation margin of 7%, declined from 33% of PLN\u2019s total \nrevenues  in  2014  to  21%  in  2019.  The  government  has  significantly  streamlined  business  licensing  processes, \nexpanded  financial  guarantees,  and  provided  targets  for  PLN  on  private  sector  procurement.  Details  are  in  the \nProgram Expenditure and Financing Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 ADB.  2017.

Poorly electrified households are those that receive intermittent power \n\nfrom small diesel generators and poorly maintained solar plants. \n\n\f \n\nchallenges in the target provinces. Papua, West Papua, and West Kalimantan have some of the \nlowest human development indexes, while these provinces and East and North Kalimantan have \nthe  lowest  gender  development  indexes  in  Indonesia.  Women\u2019s  share  of  income  is  low  in  all \nprovinces  of  Kalimantan,  Maluku,  and  Papua,  with  the  lowest  share  in  East  (23%)  and  North \n(26%) Kalimantan, versus a national average of 37%.15 Disaggregated data is not available and \nthere is a need to measure the impact of electrification programs on social development. \n \n\n \n\nCOVID-19 impact. Indonesia is among the hardest-hit countries in Southeast Asia by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The economy is expected to contract by 1%, down from 5.0% growth in \n2019  and  from  5.4%  growth  originally  expected  for  2020.16 In  order  to  cushion  the  economic \nshocks to the poor during the pandemic, along with other measures the government announced \nfree electricity for 24 million households in the 450-volt ampere (VA) category, and a 50% discount \nfor 7 million households in the 900 VA category.17 This has affected PLN\u2019s revenues, and PLN \nrequires financial support to enhance its quality and coverage of services. Reliable electricity is a \nprerequisite to continue work, education, and essential health and public services especially when \nphysical movement is restricted.18 The program would enable ADB to support economic recovery \nin Eastern Indonesia and contribute to more equitable and resilient growth post COVID-19. \n \n\n \n\nThe program. The program will enhance sustainable, equitable, and reliable access to \nelectricity for the population in nine provinces in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua and finance a \nslice  of  the  broader  program  in  the  RUPTL  2019\u20132028.  PLN  has  a  financing  gap  for  power \ndelivery to communities, including through the use of cost efficient local renewable sources, for \nwhich it is seeking ADB support under the proposed program. \n \n\n \n\nElectrification impacts. Increased electrification has been shown to result in improved \ndevelopment  outcomes,  including  increased  incomes,  higher  school  attendance,  reduced \nrespiratory  illness,  and  improved time  poverty  especially  for  women.  An  important  lesson from \nprograms in other countries is that consumer education and training are essential to achieve such \nimproved development outcomes.19 \n \n\n  Modality. The RBL modality is suitable as it will (i) increase accountability for delivering \nand sustaining results (e.g., by ensuring that community-level solar installations are functioning); \n(ii) consolidate gains in institutional strengthening from previous RBL programs;20 (iii) fit with the \ngovernment\u2019s  fast-expanding  universal  electrification  strategy  and  efforts  to  enhance  PLN\u2019s \nefficiency  and  governance,  through  internal  controls  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E), \nprocurement,  and  financial  reporting;  (iv)  reduce  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  small, \nscattered  investments;  and  (v)  stimulate  financing  and  harmonization  with  other  development \npartners (footnote 2). The program will incorporate lessons from the previous RBL programs, such \nas  the  need  to  further  strengthen  PLN\u2019s  internal M&E,  waste  and  asset management,  support \n\n \n\n15 Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Empowerment  &  Child  Protection  and  Badan  Pusat  Statistik (Indonesian  Central  Statistical \n\nOffice). 2018.

The RBL program\u2019s impact is aligned with the RUPTL goal of enhancing \nthe quality of life in Indonesian society through the use of electricity (footnote 5). The outcome will \nbe  sustainable,  equitable,  and  reliable  access  to  electricity  for  the  population  in  Kalimantan, \nMaluku, and Papua enhanced. Three disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) at the outcome level \nfocus on (i) the number of customers (DLI 1); (ii) the number of poor households electrified (DLI 2), \nsupported by the JFPR grant, with a target that at least 10% of electrified households be headed \nby  women;24 and  (iii)  the  reliability  of  services,  as  measured  by  the  reduction  in  feeder  line \npermanent  interruptions  (DLI  3).  A  baseline  study  and  impact  evaluation  will  measure  social \noutcome indicators such as improved time use, separately for women and men.25 Three output-\nlevel results contribute to the outcomes: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput 1. Power distribution network strengthened and expanded. This will \nbe tracked by the installed length of medium-voltage distribution lines (DLI 4). \nOutput 2. Renewable energy use increased. Electricity provided to communities \nin  the  target  areas  will  be  from  a  mix  of  power  sources,  including  small  diesel \ngenerators, which is the most common for remote grids. Output 2, supported by \nthe  ACEF  grant,  explicitly  focuses  on  increasing  power  generation  from  solar \nphotovoltaic, mini and micro-hydro, and small biogas power plants (DLI 5).26 \nInstitutional  capacity  strengthened  and  social  monitoring \nOutput  3. \nenhanced. Output 3 focuses on improving asset and waste management (DLI 6) \nand on enhancing social and gender aspects through PLN workshops on safe and \nproductive energy use, with at least 30% female participation (DLI 7). Electronic \nprocurement and contract payment systems will be integrated (DLI 8).27 \n\n \n\n \n\nThese  three  outputs  are  sufficient  to  achieve  the  outcome,  and  the  DLIs  and  other \nperformance indicators provide ambitious yet achievable measures of progress toward outputs \nand outcome. The DLI targets were developed in consultation with experienced system planners \nin  PLN  and  are  as  close  as  possible  to  the  government-driven  RUPTL  targets,  while  carefully \nconsidering  PLN\u2019s  actual  performance  during  2012\u20132018.

The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the borrower and ADB. PLN will submit a withdrawal \napplication reporting on the achievement of the DLIs, and disbursement will be made subject to \nverification by an IVA in accordance with the agreed verification protocols (Appendix 3). If a target \nhas  not  been  fully  achieved  but  partial  disbursement  has  been  agreed  for  that  DLI,  ADB  will \ndetermine the amount to be disbursed based on the level of achievement. Loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to PLN\u2019s general account with a commercial bank. Grant proceeds will be disbursed to \nseparate  accounts  set  up  by  PLN  for  each  grant.  Advance  financing  under  the  loan  and  both \nJFPR  and  ACEF  grants,  and  financing  for  prior results  under the  loan  and  JFPR  grant  will  be \nmade available to address financing requirements as needed within the RBL policy limits.32 PLN \nwill refund any advance financing amount outstanding if the DLIs are not achieved. \n \nF. \n \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n \n\nVarious  assessments  have  identified  capacity  gaps  for  implementing  the  RBL  program \n(paras. 22\u201335). Based on these assessments, a PAP was developed to enhance PLN\u2019s capacity \n(in addition to strengthening through the three output-level institutional strengthening DLIs). The \nPAP includes actions in specific technical areas, M&E, fiduciary management, and safeguards to \nstrengthen  PLN  systems,  help  achieve  DLIs,  and  make  the  program results more  sustainable. \nThe  PAP  will  focus  on  implementation  capacity,  which  will  complement  physical  investments \nunder the program and contribute to PLN\u2019s overall efforts to increase the capacity of its staff and \nimprove institutional monitoring and reporting systems. \n \nG. \n\nGrant Assistance \n\n \n\nConnections for poor households, a social and gender impact evaluation study, and PLN \nworkshops on safe and productive electricity use will be supported by the JFPR grant proceeds.33 \nThe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  solar  photovoltaic  systems  using  advanced  technology, \nincluding  improvements  in  system  design  and  maintenance  procedures,  will  be  supported  by \nACEF grant proceeds. \n \nH. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nPLN  is  the  executing  agency.  Program  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  PLN\u2019s \nadministrative  regional  units  (UIWs)  and  units  that  report  to  them\u2014the  Customer  Service \nImplementation  Units  (UP3s),  Electricity  Project  Implementation  Units  (UP2Ks),  and  Customer \nServices Units (ULPs)\u2014in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua, with oversight by PLN headquarters \nin Jakarta.34 The program will be implemented from January 2020 to December 2025.35 \n\n \n32 Financing for prior results will not be applicable under the ACEF grant. \n33 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Unit  Pelaksana  Pelayanan  Pelanggan  (UP3)  was  previously  called  Area;  Unit  Layanan  Pelanggan  (ULP)  was \npreviously called Rayon; and Key PLN divisions in headquarters have developed good capacity to plan and manage \nRBL programs because of their experience with previous RBL programs (footnote 20). \n\n35 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \n\nA  review  of  the  technical  soundness  of  the  program  shows  that  the  power  distribution \ndesign is simple and straightforward, and generally follows international practice. Overall, PLN\u2019s \nplan to develop the power systems in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua is operationally viable and \ncan be expected to increase service coverage and reliability.36 These conclusions underpin the \nresults areas, key actions to be taken, and performance indicators for the sector overall, and the \nRBL program in particular. \n \n\n \n\nThe  program\u2019s  poverty reduction  and social  impact  cuts across many  sectors  including \ntourism, health, fisheries, and agroindustry. Over 890,000 households (including the poorest and \nthe most remote) will benefit from having electricity access. Children will be able to read and study \nin the evenings, and indoor air quality will improve as fuel lamps are eliminated. Women and men \nwill be able to communicate better and access information via their phones. Village schools and \nhealth centers will benefit from lighting, refrigeration, and equipment for vaccination. The program \nwill also expand electricity access to small and medium-sized businesses, and can contribute to \nsubstantial job growth, which will support the post-COVID recovery for Eastern Indonesia. 37 \n \n\n \n\nGender mainstreaming is addressed by two DLIs. DLI 2 will ensure that poor households \nheaded by women are provided with reliable and affordable electricity supply, which will reduce \nthe time and effort spent by women to obtain other fuels, enable women to run income-generating \nactivities in their homes, and acquire knowledge through telecommunications.38 Communities will \nbe able to pump and store water, while having well-lit streets will deter crime and enhance safety \nfor girls and women. DLI 7 (on consumer education) requires at least 30% female participation in \nthe  community  workshops  (with  incentives  to  reach  50%). 39  Gender  mainstreaming  is  also \nsupported through community training on basic solar photovoltaic maintenance, with a focus on \nwomen\u2019s involvement. \n \n\n \n\nThe program will generate positive net incremental economic benefits from the additional \nelectricity supply. The program\u2019s economic viability is assessed on the basis of a network system \napproach  for  the  entire  PLN  program  in  Kalimantan,  Maluku,  and  Papua,  as  the  benefits  are \ndependent on interlinked investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. \n  \nB. \n \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n  Monitoring and evaluation systems. PLN\u2019s corporate M&E system has the capacity to \ntrack  all  DLIs  as  well  as  other  indicators.  Of  the  eight  DLIs,  PLN\u2019s  Management  Reporting \nInformation System already monitors DLIs 1, 3, 4, and 5, while other systems can complement \nand/or monitor DLIs 5, 6, and 8. The remaining indicators (DLIs 2 and 7) relate to the gender and \nsocial dimensions of the RBL program, and PLN is introducing special procedures to strengthen \nits information systems at both the field and central levels to report properly on these dimensions \nfor the first time. Monthly reports provide comprehensive data on all aspects of PLN\u2019s operation, \n\n \n\n36 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 In Bhutan this gave women greater self-confidence and more of a voice in household decisions (footnote 19). \n39 The  30%  minimum  threshold  is  established  because  local  officials\u2014mainly  men\u2014would  attend  this  activity.  In \naddition, since the project is spread out in many remote villages, pregnant women and women with young children \nmay find it difficult to travel to the workshop venue if held outside the village. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nand are reviewed at monthly consultations between PLN headquarters and UIW staff. IVA reports \nfrom the previous two RBL programs are being used to strengthen PLN\u2019s M&E systems. \n \n\n \n\nFiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and audit. These systems were assessed to determine their ability to \nmanage  fiduciary  risks  and  provide  assurance  that  the  RBL  program  funds  will  be  used  as \nintended, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.40 The fiduciary assessment found \nthat consolidated financial reporting and budgeting improvements were required. These fiduciary \nsystem improvements will be addressed through system enhancements in the PAP, with relevant \nstaff required to attend training for these systems. \n \n\n \n\nFinancial management. A financial management assessment of PLN was carried out in \n2015  (footnote  20)  and 2017  (footnote  4),  and  updated for the  program. The  assessment  was \nconducted with reference to relevant ADB guidance on financial management and concluded that \nPLN\u2019s  financial  management  systems  are  adequate  for  the  RBL  program,  with  improvements \nneeded in terms of timely budget execution and accounting and reporting. Administrative delays \nresulting in government financial support for PLN were identified as a risk. ADB, the World Bank, \nand other development partners will continue to mitigate this risk through ongoing TA support to \nstrengthen public financial management arrangements (footnote 28). \n \n\n \n\nPLN has been mandated to execute a significant investment program against a backdrop \nof uncertainty especially with COVID-19 impacts and volatile fuel prices, inflation, interest rate, \nand  foreign  exchange.41 This  presents  a  challenge  to  PLN\u2019s  financial  management,  and  the \nmonitoring  and  early  detection  of  deteriorating  financial  performance  is addressed  in the  PAP. \nContinued government support is critical to ensure PLN\u2019s financial sustainability and to achieve \nthe program\u2019s objectives. ADB and PLN will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Finance.42 \n \n\n \n\nProcurement.  A  procurement  assessment  covered \n\nthe  (i)  procurement  profile; \n(ii) regulations,  rules,  and  procedures;  (iii)  organizational  arrangements  and  capacity;  and \n(iv) system performance.43 The program will rely on PLN\u2019s systems and will exclude high-value \ncontracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy. The scope of procurement for the RBL program \ninclude: materials, works and service contracts for distribution lines; engineering, procurement, \nand construction of small renewable energy systems; and goods and works for in-house wiring. \nPLN  will  procure  the  materials  for  distribution  centrally  through  limited  bidding  and  framework \ncontracts. The procurement of works and installation services will be carried out by the UIW offices \nand  their  subsidiary  units.  Procurement  of  advanced  technology  elements,  such  as  remote \nmonitoring and energy management systems, will be carried out following PLN\u2019s open competitive \nbidding procedures that allow participation by international bidders. \n \n\n \n\nPrevious  RBL  procurement  risk  assessments  (conducted  in  2015  and  2017)  rated  the \noverall risks as moderate. The procurement assessment finds the moderate rating still valid. The \nmain deficiencies and risks in PLN\u2019s procurement system are (i) lack of an integrated information \ntechnology system to report, monitor, and analyze procurement and contract data; (ii) limitations \n\n \n\n40 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 For example, the government announced in 2014 a program to add 35 gigawatts of new power generation capacity \n\nby 2019. This timeline has subsequently been extended. \n\n42 Program  Expenditure  and  Financing  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2) \nincludes information on key financial risks and mitigants for PLN, including those related to COVID-19; and to support \nPLN during its significant capital investment growth phase, the program proposes modified financial covenants, which \nwill be applied consistently to all ADB loans under implementation. \n\n43 Procurement Assessment of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation) (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\non international bidders who wish to participate, because of requirements for local content; (iii) \nthe use of procurement methods with limited competition; (iv) insufficient procurement capacity \nor capacity of local contractors to scale up procurement under the program, especially in UIWs; \nand (v) insufficient procurement planning, which may lead to implementation delays. A key lesson \nfrom previous RBL programs is the low level of utilization of the contract monitoring application \nand lack of integration with the contract payment system. These will be addressed through DLI 8 \nof the proposed program. Other key procurement risks will be addressed through the PAP. \n \n\n \n\nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.44 The  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were \nexplained to and discussed with PLN.45 \n \n\n \n\nSafeguard  systems.  The  program  is  expected  to  generate  significant  positive \nenvironmental  and  social  benefits  from  reduced  indoor  kerosene  and  wood  consumption. \nPromotion of renewable energy use will also lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions and \nhealth  benefits.  The  program  safeguard  system  assessment,  undertaken  by  ADB  with  PLN  \ndrawing on previous related assessments, confirmed the safeguards classification of category B \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.46 The adverse environmental \nimpacts of eligible activities under the program are anticipated to be minimal to minor, site-specific, \nreversible,  and  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  through  good  construction  practices.  No \nimpact is anticipated to result in irreversible and permanent damage. No physical displacement \nor relocation of people is anticipated. The expansion of distribution lines will require 0.2 square \nmeters  (for  concrete  poles)  to  24  square  meters  (for  pad  mounted  and  on-ground  distribution \ntransformers)  of  land.  Village-level  power  generation  facilities  will  require  0.2  hectares  to  2.0 \nhectares  of  land.  There  are  customary  communities  in  the  project  area,  and  some  of  the  land \nused for the program may be owned by indigenous peoples groups. Program impact will not be \nsignificant, as it will involve minor land losses and will not lead to relocation for the communities. \nActions  to  strengthen  meaningful  consultations,  screening  process  to  ensure  the  exclusion  of \ncategory  A  activities,  and  provision  of  programs  on  access  and  awareness  of  electricity  to \nindigenous peoples have been included in the safeguard program actions.     \n \n\n \n\nThe program safeguard systems currently in place are broadly aligned with the objectives, \nscope,  and  triggers  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  considered  generally \nacceptable.47 PLN has established a relatively comprehensive system of guidelines and decrees \nthat supplement the national regulatory framework for environmental and social safeguards. PLN \nhas  a  robust  institutional  structure  with  broadly  adequate  staffing,  with  ongoing  deployment  of \nadditional safeguards specialists at the UIW, UP3, and ULP levels. Gaps in safeguard systems \nhave been identified with respect to (i) PLN\u2019s institutional capacity, especially at the UIW, UP3, \nand  ULP  levels;  (ii)  environmental  and  social  safeguards  screening;  (iii)  transparent  and \nconsistent procedures for negotiated land acquisition and donation; (iv) monitoring and reporting; \n(v) asset and waste management; (vi) warehouses operating without permits; and (vii) meaningful \nconsultation, including involvement of vulnerable, indigenous, and customary community groups, \nand  awareness  raising  on  electrical  safety.  These  will  be  addressed through  DLI  6 (asset  and \nwaste management and warehouse permits) and the PAP, including a screening mechanism to \nensure  that  the  RBL  program  excludes  activities  that  would  be  classified  as  category  A  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n \n\n44 Integrity Disclosure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) includes information on the recent \n\ninvestigation by the Corruption Eradication Commission. \n\n45 ADB. 2018.

A significant proportion of \npoor households, including households headed \nby women, may be unable to connect because \nof depth of poverty and remote location. \nProgram scope. Insufficient commitment and \ngovernment support to increase small \nrenewable energy use in the RUPTL. \n\nFinancial sustainability. PLN\u2019s free cash flow \ndecreases from forecasted levels, resulting in a \ndelay to its capital expenditure program. \n\nFiduciary. PLN struggles with initiatives to \nstrengthen internal controls. \n\nKey Mitigating Measures \nPLN will use the poverty-focused JFPR grant to support in-house \nwiring costs for poor households. The loan and the ACEF grant \nwill support PLN to connect remote villages using small grids with \nrenewable energy systems. \nPLN will propose additional community-scale renewable energy \ninvestments in future RUPTL updates. PLN, with support from \nADB, will engage with the Ministry of Mineral Resources \nthroughout the program.  \nPLN will provide quarterly financial reporting and rolling 3-year \nfinancial projections to identify early indicators of heightened \ncredit stress. PLN will also report on key internal initiatives to \nreduce the cost of electricity supply. ADB and PLN, in close \ncoordination with the Ministry of Finance, will discuss budget \nsupport requirements during program implementation. \nThe e-procurement system will be used to track contract awards \nand detect any red flags. Any issues identified will be discussed \nwith PLN\u2019s management team, and relevant government \nauthorities as appropriate. \nPLN and ADB will have close coordination with the Ministry of \nState-Owned Enterprises and Ministry of Environment and \nForestry during program implementation. \nPLN will obtain additional data on households headed by women \nfrom the government and add a data field in its database for poor \nhouseholds. \nModerate \n\nSafeguards. The issuance of government \napprovals for the disposal of assets and wastes \nand licensing of warehouses is delayed. \nMonitoring and evaluation.

While  the \nIndonesian  Central  Statistical  Office  defines  a  female-headed  household  as  one  where  a  woman  is  the  family \nbreadwinner or considered the head of the family, local governments classify a household as female-headed only \nwhen the woman is widowed or divorced. The RBL program will use the local government definition, as this is the \nonly data that is regularly available at the local level.  \n\nc  PLN and local governments identify poor households through a database updated yearly. The updates by the local \n\ngovernments are provided to PLN, as poor households are entitled to receive subsidies for electricity tariffs. \n\nd  PLN defines permanent interruptions as those over 5 minutes in duration. \ne  Environmental Permit and License to Operate Hazardous Waste Disposal. \nf  Female  participation  is  at  a  minimum  of  30%  because  (i)  village  and  district  officials  must  be  included  in  the \nworkshops and they are mostly men, and (ii) most workshops are held at the UP3 level (not at the village level) and \nwill require women to travel away from their homes, which is difficult for women with young children. \n\ng  Scoring system: one workshop with 30% female participation will count as 1.0 point, while one workshop with 50% \n\nfemale participation will count as 1.25 points. \n\nh  The output indicator 3d is not related to the outcome indicator d. The output indicator 3d strengthens PLN\u2019s capacity \nto report on social dimensions and impact of its work, while the outcome indicator d measures social and gender \nimpact by an independent evaluation. \n\ni  The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant will support outcome indicator b (DLI 2) and outcome indicator \nd; output indicator 3b(DLI 7); and the initial framework for the first report for output indicator 3d. The JFPR grant will \nbe disbursed against DLI 2 because of the importance of this DLI to JFPR. \n\nj  The Asian Clean Energy Fund grant will support output indicator 2a (DLI 5) and output indicator 2b. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and PLN. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=51114-001-3  \n \n\nLoan Agreement: Ordinary Operations \nGrant Agreement: Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nGrant Agreement: Asian Clean Energy Fund \nGuarantee Agreement \nCountry Economic Indicators \nSector Assessment (Summary): Energy \nProgram Soundness Assessment \nProgram Results Assessment \nProgram Results Framework \nProgram Expenditure and Financing Assessment \nProgram Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment \nProgram Fiduciary Systems Assessment \nProgram Safeguard Systems Assessment \nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nProgram Action Plan \nProgram Implementation Document \nContribution to the ADB Results Framework \nDevelopment Coordination \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant \n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n12. \n13. \n14. \n15. \n16. \n17. \n18. \n19. \n20. \n \nSupplementary Documents \n21. \n22.

(ii) \n\nDefinitions: The percentage of \u201cthe used equipment safely disposed\u201d \nwill be calculated on the basis of the original value of assets which are \nstocked at PLN warehouse sites in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua. \nThe  \u201cdisposal  inventory\u201d  is  a  nationwide  inventory  of  all  PLN  used \nequipment that are intended for disposal.  \n\nThe  \u201cpermit  from  DLH\u201d  refers  to  the  Environmental  Permit  (Ijin \nLingkungan), which has to be obtained for each warehouse from the \nprovincial or district environmental agency (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup). \n\n\"Used  PLN  equipment\"  means  PLN\u2019s  assets  and  wastes  (such  as \npoles,  cables,  transformers,  and  meters)  that  are  out  of  use,  which \nhave  been  discharged  from  distribution  operations.  \u201cAssets\u201d  and \n\u201cwastes\u201d are the same in nature, but \"assets\" become \"wastes\" once \nthese are approved as \"waste\" by the relevant authorities.  \n\n\u201cSafe disposal\u201d means disposing of equipment through the following \nprocess:  \n\nUsed  equipment,  still  considered  as  Government  assets,  are \nrequired to go through internal audit and verification within PLN \ninvolving the MSOE.  \n\nBroken  materials  of  less  than  5  years  economic  life  can  be \ndisposed through auction at the discretion of PLN headquarters, \nafter approval of the PLN Board of Commissioners.  \n\nUsed assets of more than 5 years of economic life are disposed \nafter approval by the MSOE.  \n\nThe  process  of  inventory,  review,  audit,  and  verification  by  different \nunits is further subject to legal requirements for the relevant authority \nto sign accountability statements. \n\nConditions for disbursement are met for a specific year when the \ninstitutional  actions  and/or  percentage  targets  set  for  that  year  (as \nindicated in the first column) are achieved.  \n\nPartial disbursement. Partial disbursements are allowed as follows. \nFor  2020,  2021,  and  2025,  each  year  has  two  institutional  actions \n(each representing 50% of the disbursement allocation for that year), \nwhile 2022, 2023, and 2024 require three actions (each representing \n33% of the disbursement allocation for that year). Partial disbursement \n\n \n\n\fDefinition and Description of Achievement and Verification \n\nVerification Agency and Procedure \n\nInformation Source \nand Frequency \n\ncan therefore be made for a given year proportional to the number of \nactions completed.  \n\nPartial  disbursement  is  also  permitted  within  a  single  institutional \naction.  For  example,  within  the  component  relating  to  percentage  of \nwaste  disposal,  and  the  component  relating  to  the  number  of \nwarehouses having obtained permits from DLH, partial disbursement \ncan be made for each component following the formula.  \n\nPartial  DLI  disbursement  =  planned  DLI \ndisbursement for the period(cid:1) (actual achievement of \nthe  current  period\u2013targeted  achievement  of  the \nprevious  period)/  (targeted  achievement  of  the \ncurrent  period\u2013targeted  achievement  of \nthe \nprevious period).  \n\nHowever, partial disbursement cannot be made for the action relating \nto the approval by the MSOE of the 2019 inventory of used equipment \nfor disposal.  \n\nDisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI, \nincluding the institutional actions mentioned above. This means that \nthe  planned  disbursement  amount  for  a  given  year can  be released \nwhen the set target is fully achieved even if the achievement is late, as \nlong  as  the  achievement  is  during  the  program\u2019s  duration.  Early \npayment is also allowed when achievement is earlier than scheduled.  \n\nDLI 7. Consumer education: By 2024, consumer education workshops on safe and productive energy use are implemented by 5 UIW and 29 UP3 offices, \nwith a minimum of 30% female participation for each workshop, based on a scoring system to promote female participation \n\nDefinitions: The consumer education workshops are defined as those \nheld by PLN for consumers/customers who are connected, planning to \nbe  connected,  or  in  the  process  of  connection,  with  the  workshop \ncurriculum on safe and productive energy use agreed to by PLN and \nADB. \u201cFemale participation\u201d is calculated as the percentage of women \nconsumers among total consumers participating in the workshop, and \nnot the authorities officiating at the workshop.   \n\nCounting  the  workshops:  The  workshop(s)  will  be  counted  as  1 \nworkshop only when the number of participants from the community \nreaches or exceeds 100 persons. This 100 person threshold may be \nreached by (i) having a single workshop with at least 100 participants \nfrom  the  community,  or  (ii)  holding  a  number  of  smaller  workshops \nwhere  the  participants  from  the  communities  add  up  to  at  least  100 \npersons  across  these  workshops  (example:  3  workshops  with \n\nPLN UIW records \nand PLN central \nrecords. Frequency \nfor reporting will be \nannual. However, \nmonitoring may be \nas frequent as PLN \nwishes. \n\nEach year, the focal unit in PLN \nprepares an attestation that the DLI is \nmet and attaches the relevant report. \n\nThe IVA will verify the results each year \nwith UIW and UP3 records, participant \nlists, and with the social resource \nperson(s) The IVA will refer to the \nverification guidelines prepared for the \nprogram. The IVA report will then be \nattached to the PLN report.  \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDisbursement-Linked \nIndicator \n\n65% of 2019 inventory \nsafely disposed.

Cumulative \npoints required for \ndisbursement: 34 \n\n2022: Consumer \neducation workshops held \nat each of 29 UP3 with \nminimum 30% female \nparticipation among \nconsumers. Cumulative \npoints required for \ndisbursement: 63 \n\n2023: Consumer \neducation workshops held \nat each of 29 UP3 with \nminimum 30% female \nparticipation among \nconsumers. Cumulative \npoints required for \ndisbursement: 92 \n\n2024: Consumer \neducation workshops held \nat UP3 level with minimum \n30% female participation \namong consumers. \nCumulative points required \nfor disbursement: 121.  \n\nrespectively 20, 40 and 40 community participants\u2014in this case, these \n3 smaller workshops combined count as 1 workshop).   \n\n\u201cScoring system\u201d: 1 workshop with 30% female participation counts \nas  1  point,  while  1  workshop  with  female  participation  of  50%  and \nabove counts as 1.25 points. Workshops with less than 30% female \nparticipation  will  not  earn  any  points.  This  means  that  having \nworkshops with 50% female participation will earn more points, leading \nto fewer workshops required in the last year. \n\nConditions for disbursement are met for a specific year when the \nrequired number of points for that year (first column) is achieved with \nnot less than 30% female participation.  \n\nFor  2020,  completion  of  (i)  is  required  and  cannot  be  partially \ndisbursed, while (ii) is scalable, meaning that partial disbursement is \nallowed. For disbursement of allocated amounts (Table A3.3) for 2021, \n2022, and 2023, the following are required: (i) a minimum of 29 points \neach  year,  (ii)  workshops  held  at  each  of  the  29  UP3  (iii)  each \nworkshop having at least 30% female participation.  \n\nThe corresponding number of required cumulative points are stated in \ncolumn  1.  For  2024,  disbursement  is  allowed  when  the  cumulative \nnumber  of  points  achieved  over  the  period  2021\u20132024  reaches  or \nexceeds 121 points.  \n\nPartial  disbursement.  Much  of  the  DLI  is  scalable  and  partial \ndisbursement is allowed according to the number of points accrued. If \nthe target is not fully achieved in any given year, then disbursement \ncan  be  proportional  to  the  increase  made  from  the  previous  year\u2019s \ntargeted achievement. The following formula will be applied:  \n\nPartial  DLI  disbursement  =  planned  DLI \ndisbursement for the period(cid:1) (actual achievement \nof the current period\u2013targeted achievement of the \nprevious  period)/  (targeted  achievement  of  the \ncurrent  period\u2013targeted  achievement  of \nthe \nprevious period). \n\nHowever, for the 30% female participation, the DLI is not scalable, and \nfull disbursement is made only when female participation is not less \nthan 30%. \n\nDisbursements  are  allowed  for  late  achievement  of  the  DLI.  This \nmeans that the planned disbursement amount for a given year can be \nreleased when the target number of points is fully achieved even if the \nachievement  is  late,  as  long  as  the  achievement  is  during  the \n\n \n\n\fDefinition and Description of Achievement and Verification \n\nVerification Agency and Procedure \n\nInformation Source \nand Frequency \n\nprogram\u2019s duration. However, within a given year, training has to cover \na  certain  number  of  UP3  levels,  and  therefore,  early  achievement \ncannot be made more than a year in advance.  \n\nDLI 8. E-Procurement and SAP systems are integrated and rolled out by 2020, and at least 80% of contracts in financial value are recorded in the E-\nProc+SAP integrated system by 2024. \n\n2018 baseline:  \n\nDefinitions: \n\nE-Procurement (E-Proc) \nand SAP systems are \nseparate.   \n\nThe  baseline  situation  in  2018  is  that  (i)  only  a  small  proportion  of \ncontracts  are  recorded  in  E-Proc,  and  (ii)  E-Proc  system  and  SAP \nsystem are separate systems, not integrated. \n\nPLN UIW records \nand PLN central \nrecords.  \n\nFrequency for \nreporting will be \nannual. However, \nmonitoring may be \nas frequent as PLN \nwishes. \n\nEach year, the focal unit in PLN \nprepares an attestation that the DLI is \nmet and attaches the relevant report. \n\nThe IVA will verify the results each year \nwith UIW and UP3 records and the E-\nProc+SAP system records.  \n\nThe IVA will refer to the verification \nguidelines prepared for the program. \nThe IVA report will then be attached to \nthe PLN report.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWithin one month of receiving the \nvalidated report, ADB will confirm \nwhether the target has been met. \n\nIntegration of the two systems means that one report is generated by \nan  E-Proc+SAP  system  for  a  given  procurement  transaction.  An \ninternal letter is sent by PLN headquarters to the regions instructing \nthem the system is ready for use. \n\nRolled out means that the access has been granted to UIWs and units \nunder them, and that the relevant staff (e.g., for the first year of roll-\nout) have been trained in the use of the system. \n\nContracts  executed  means  contracts  that  have  been  awarded,  with \ncorresponding legal commitments signed by both parties. \n\nFor  disbursement  trigger  points  in  2021,  2022,  2023  and  2024,  the \npercentages relate to the following denominator and numerator: \n\nDenominator: Total value of procurement contracts executed by UIW \nand units under them.  \n\nNumerator:  Total  value  of  procurement  contracts  recorded  in  the  E-\nProc+SAP  system.  \u201cRecorded\u201d  means  a  procurement  contract  is \nrecorded  in  the  E-Proc+SAP  system,  whether  e-procurement  was \nused  for  the  actual  tendering  process,  or  whether  the  procurement \ncontract  was  recorded  in  the  e-procurement  system  only  after  the \ncontract award/tendering.  \n\nConditions for disbursement are met for a specific year when the \nrequired  conditions  for  that  year  (as  indicated  in  the  first  column)  is \nachieved.  \n\nPartial disbursement. For 2020, completion of systems integration is \nrequired and cannot be partially disbursed.  \n\nThe  rest  of  the  DLI  is  scalable  and  partial  disbursement  is  allowed \naccording to the percentage of total contracts executed that have been \nrecorded  in  the  integrated  E-Proc+SAP  system  in  terms  of  financial \nvalue.  \n\n28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDisbursement-Linked \nIndicator \n\nPrior results 2019: E-\nProc and SAP are \nintegrated. \n\n2020: E-Proc+SAP \nintegrated system is rolled \nout. \n\n2021: At least 50% of \ncontracts in financial value \nexecuted by UIW \n(including units under \nthem) recorded in E-\nProc+SAP integrated \nsystem. \n\n2022: At least 60% of \ncontracts in financial value \nexecuted by UIW \n(including units under \nthem) recorded in E-\nProc+SAP integrated \nsystem  \n\n2023: At least 70% of \ncontracts in financial value \nexecuted by UIW \n(including units under \nthem) recorded in E-\nProc+SAP integrated \nsystem  \n\n2024: At least 80% of \ncontracts in financial value \nexecuted by UIW \n\n \n\n\fDefinition and Description of Achievement and Verification \n\nVerification Agency and Procedure \n\nInformation Source \nand Frequency \n\nAppendix 3      29 \n\nDisbursement-Linked \nIndicator \n\n(including units under \nthem) recorded in E-\nProc+SAP integrated \nsystem \n\nIf  the  target  is  not  fully  achieved,  then  disbursement  can  be \nproportional  to  the increase made from  the previous  year\u2019s  targeted \nachievement. The following formula will be applied:  \n\n \nPartial  DLI  disbursement  =  planned  DLI \ndisbursement for the period(cid:1) (actual achievement \nof the current period\u2013targeted achievement of the \nprevious  period)/  (targeted  achievement  of  the \ncurrent  period\u2013targeted  achievement  of \nthe \nprevious period). \n \n\nDisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of the DLI, \nincluding the institutional actions mentioned above. This means that \nthe  planned  disbursement  amount  for  a  given  year can  be released \nwhen the target is fully achieved even if the achievement is late, as \nlong  as  the  achievement  is  during  the  program\u2019s  duration.
