The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the Punjab Development Finance \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe program seeks to facilitate implementation of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation \n2. \nprogram  in  Punjab. This  will  generate fiscal savings  and  make  better  use  of  scarce  budgetary \nresources, and thereby help with socioeconomic development of the state.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nCurrent economic status. Punjab is primarily an agrarian economy with a population of \n3. \n28 million. It has been instrumental in ensuring national food security since the 1960s following \nthe  advent  of  the  green  revolution.  The  state  government  traditionally  provides  subsidies, \nincluding  free  power  to  farmers  to  promote  agriculture,  which  is  constrained  by  declining \nproductivity,  soil  degradation,  and  water  depletion. 3  This  has  many  ramifications.  Punjab\u2019s \nranking  in  per  capita  income  in  India  declined  from  fourth  in  FY2004  to  seventh  in  FY2012. \nGross state  domestic  product  (GSDP) growth  was  6%  during  FY2002\u2013FY2006  compared  with \n7.6% for the country, and 6.5% during FY2007\u2013FY2012 compared with 7.5% for the country. \n \n4. \nLarge  committed  expenditures.  Despite  relatively  robust  own-tax  effort  with  an  own-\ntax  to  GSDP  ratio  of  8.3%  in  FY2012  (Table  1),  the  deteriorating  fiscal  situation  has  placed \nadded pressures on public resources, constraining capital investment and leading to low growth \nand poor delivery of public goods and services in the state.4 The committed expenditures of the \nstate government (salaries, pensions, interest payments, and subsidies) have almost exhausted \nthe total revenue receipts in recent years, requiring the state to undertake even larger borrowing \nto finance these expenditures in addition to capital expenditure, thereby trapping the state in a \nvicious  cycle  of  mounting  current  account  (revenue)  and  fiscal  deficits.5 The  weak  financial \nperformance  of  public  sector  enterprises,  including  the  newly  created  Punjab  State  Power \nCorporation  Limited  (PSPCL)  and  Punjab  State  Transmission  Corporation  Limited,  has \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance, approved by the director \ngeneral  of  the  South  Asia  Department  on  22  November  2012  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$220,000, as a subproject under the cluster TA (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for Advanced \nProject Preparedness for Poverty Reduction. Manila [C-TA 0003-IND, financed by the Government of the United \nKingdom through the Department for International Development]). \n\n3   The primary sector contributed more than 57% to GSDP in FY1970, followed by the tertiary sector (27%) and the \nsecondary sector (16%), but the contribution to GSDP originating from the primary sector declined to nearly 47% in \nFY1990 and 21.8% in FY2012. \n\n4   The Government of Punjab (GOP) fails to provide matching grants to several centrally sponsored schemes in such \nareas as rural housing and rural livelihood. Consequently, the national government does not transfer all the project \nfunds originally approved. \n\n5   The debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio for FY2012 will be much higher than 31.7% if off-budget items and contingent liabilities \nare  included.  Moreover,  Punjab  has  accessed  ways  and  means  advances  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  for \nhighest number of days across Indian states since FY2010.  \n\n \n\n\fexacerbated the growing fiscal imbalances and mounting public debt.6 \n\n \nTable 1: Key Fiscal Indicators across Selected States in India (FY2012) \n(all variables are percentage of gross state domestic product) \n \n\nGCS \nAverage \n7.7 \n0.0 \n2.6 \n24.4 \n2.4 \n\nUttar \nPradesh \n7.9 \n(0.7) \n2.8 \n33.7 \n3.4 \n\n \nBest Performing \n10.2 (Karnataka) \n(2.6) (Jharkhand) \n1.1 (Odisha) \n\n \n \nHaryana \nPunjab \nItem \n6.9 \n8.3 \nOwn tax  \n0.9 \n1.6 \nRevenue deficit \n2.3 \n3.2 \nFiscal deficit \n18.6 \n31.7 \nDebt \nCapital outlay \n1.3 \n1.5 \n(  ) = revenue surplus, GCS = general category states. \nNote: Punjab is a general category state. States are divided into general category and special \ncategory based on geographic terrain and inherent infrastructure difficulties. Revised estimates \nfor  fiscal  variables have been  used  to  facilitate comparisons  across  states.  However,  actuals \nfor Punjab for FY2012 are available. Actual figures, as a percentage of gross state domestic \nproduct, are own-tax revenue (7.9), revenue deficit (2.6), and fiscal deficit (3.3). \nSource: Reserve Bank of India report on state finances, a study of state budgets, 2013\u20132014. \n \n\n12.5 (Chattisgarh) \n\n4.6  (Bihar) \n\n5. \nLimited  fiscal  flexibility.  Punjab\u2019s fragile fiscal situation could  also  be  attributed  to  ad \nhoc  expenditure  planning  and  management  with  untargeted  transfer  payment  and  subsidy \nschemes. Moreover, the lack of an evaluation and monitoring system causes inordinate delays \nin  project  execution  leading  to  cost  escalation,  and  projects  quite  often  fail  to  deliver  desired \noutcomes.  More  importantly,  the  untargeted  power  subsidy  and,  in  particular,  free  power  to \nfarmers,  has  brought  both  the  state  exchequer  and  the  power  sector  to  the  brink  of  financial \ncollapse.7 The share of the subsidy in total revenue (current) expenditure was 12.8% (1.8% of \nGSDP)  in  FY2012.8 This  has  many  implications.  First,  PSPCL  is  unable  to  modernize  power \ninfrastructure  due  to  the  lack  of  borrowing  opportunities  from  banks  and  financial  institutions.9 \nSecond, the deteriorating fiscal situation of the Government of Punjab (GOP) has had negative \nconsequences  for  its  development  agenda.  In  particular,  the  increase  in  nondiscretionary \ncommitted  expenditure  has  limited  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  make  effective  use  of  public \nspending to meet its policy priorities. More directly, this has resulted in a large opportunity cost \nas  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  fiscal  adjustment  fell  on  capital  spending.  Capital  outlay \n(capital  investment)  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP  remains  lower  than  the  general  category  state \naverage (Table 1). \n \n6. \nUnsustainable  development  paradigm  due  to  power  subsidies.  Despite  GOP\u2019s \nefforts to reduce input cost through various subsidies including free power to farmers, Punjab\u2019s \nagriculture  is  currently  facing  serious  challenges.  Moreover,  power  subsidies  have  led  to  an \nunsustainable development paradigm without matching growth in food-grain yields. Indeed, high \n\n                                                \n6   Power  reforms\u2014other  than  notional  unbundling  of  the  Punjab  State  Electricity  Board\u2014need  to  be  expedited  to \n\nmeet the power needs of all sectors as well as household consumption requirements. \n\n7   In  several  instances,  the  state  exchequer  has  been  unable  to  make  cash  transfers  to  the  electricity  boards \nbecause  of  hard  budget  constraints.  Only  notional  book  adjustments  are  made.  This,  however,  aggravates  the \nproblems of the electricity boards because they have to pay for power purchases. R. Kaur and M. Sharma. 2012. \nAgricultural Subsidies in India: Case Study of Electricity Subsidy in Punjab State. International Journal of Scientific \nand Research Publication. 2 (10). \n\n8   Moreover, at an average of 1.6% of GSDP during FY2007\u2013FY2012,  power subsidies account for a disproportional \namount of the total implicit subsidies. Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9   This has other ramifications. For example, public sector banks are currently struggling with nonperforming assets \noriginating from bad loans to the state electricity boards and state power corporations. Consequently, public sector \nbanks are reluctant to lend to these electricity boards and/or corporations. \n\n2\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\npower subsidies have led to overconsumption of water, resulting in a reduction of underground \nwater reserves as the water table declines, necessitating the use of higher capacity pump sets, \nwhich, in turn, consume more power and result in higher power subsidies.10  \n \nMajor policy challenges. Punjab is caught in two vicious cycles of power subsidies and \n7. \ndebt\u2013deficit  dynamics,  reinforcing  each  other,  and  undermining  fiscal  and  environmental \nsustainability. \n \n\n \n\n \n8. \nCreating  fiscal  space.  The  logic  of  the  program  hinges  on  the  link  between  creating \nfiscal space as a means to augment and sustain capital investment in the state and laying the \ngroundwork for improvements in investment in economic and social infrastructure. However, this \nwill  require  initiating  simultaneous  and  incremental  reforms  in  state  finances  and  free  power \nsupply to agriculture.11  \n \n9. \nThe  program  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  (2013\u20132017)  for  India, \nwhich  states  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  continue  to  provide  assistance  for \nfiscal consolidation in the states to facilitate reorientation of public expenditure in favor of capital \ninvestment.12 13 \n \nBased  on  a  comprehensive  diagnostic  study  (footnote  2),  the  program  specifies  three \n10. \nareas for support in setting state finances on a path consistent with a revised and sustainable \n                                                \n10  Within  the  state,  79%  of  the  groundwater  assessment  divisions  (blocks)  are  now  considered  overexploited  and \ncritical with extraction exceeding supply. From 1982 to 1987, the water table in Central Punjab fell at an average of \n18  centimeters  per  year.  That  rate  of  decline  accelerated  to  42  centimeters/year  during  1997\u20132002,  and  to  a \nstaggering  75  centimeters  during  2002\u20132006.  Water  tables  are  now  receding  in  about  90%  of  the  state,  with \nCentral Punjab most severely affected (http://water.columbia.edu/research-projects/india/punjab-india/). Moreover, \nreduced surface water availability during the summer months due to climate change will have a serious impact on \nagriculture. Adequate groundwater can be of great help in mitigating this effect (Asian Development Bank. 2012. \nEconomics  of  Reducing  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  in  South  Asia.  Manila).  Thus,  the  program  will  facilitate \nclimate change mitigation. \n\n11  Direct and indirect subsidies and underpriced tariffs are important policy barriers for promoting renewable energy-\nbased power (Asian Development Bank. 2012. Economics of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in South Asia. \nManila). \n\n12  ADB. 2013. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2013\u20132017. Manila. \n13 The program is also consistent with ADB\u2019s assistance program for the energy sector. \n\n \n\n\fmedium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF).  Capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  under \nthe  attached  TA  will  be  critical  to  eliminating  the  constraints  of  the  state.  Sound  business \nprocesses  cannot  be  implemented  and maintained  unless  capacity  development  is  an  integral \npart of new initiatives. The program areas include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFiscal  management.  Rationalization  of  public  expenditure  to  better  support \ngrowth and human development essentially improves the allocative efficiency of \nscarce  public  resources.  Medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs)  could \nplay  an  important  role  in  strengthening  budget  and  expenditure  management \nthrough better utilization of fiscal resources, in line with priorities of GOP. Thus, \nMTEFs  for  the  line  departments,  combined  with  a  top\u2013down  MTFF,  are  the \nprerequisites  for  effectively  rationalizing  public  expenditure.  However,  an \neffective MTEF requires both a long-term sector strategy and a system of project \nappraisal  and  evaluation.  MTEFs  cannot  be  implemented  rigorously  unless \nsupported by these two tools.  \nExpenditure  rationalization  focusing  on  power  subsidy.  Given  political \nsensitivities, rationalization of the agriculture power subsidy and improvement of \nthe  targeting  of  power  subsidies  need  to  be  implemented  in  a  phased  and \nincremental  manner.  This  requires  changing  behavior  by  introducing  demand \nmanagement incentives supported by a public awareness campaign. Free power \nto farmers will continue. However, this will be capped based on normative power \nsupply requirements.14 Demand-side measures will provide incentives to farmers \nto  contain  power  consumption  below  the  normative  requirements.  The  crop-\nspecific  and  region-specific  thresholds  for  power  consumption  in  agriculture  will \nbe  worked  out  during  program  implementation  and  supported  by  the  TA.  The \nrelevant policy action could be introduced by the second tranche of the program. \nThe  GOP  has  prepared  a  strategy  to  improve  the  targeting  of  power  subsidies, \nwhich  includes  measures  to  encourage  reducing  power  consumption  to  below \nthe  normative  requirements.  Finally,  supply-side  measures  are  important  to \ntechnical \nthe  power  supply \nimprove \nperformance  of  PSPCL.  This,  in  turn,  will  improve  the  finances  of  PSPCL,  and \nthe general state budget. \nRevenue reforms. One important prerequisite of fiscal consolidation is that state \nfinances  are  augmented,  to  the  extent  possible,  by  own-revenue  sources. \nReforming the revenue streams is critical for augmenting own-revenue sources. \nThe program focuses on improving state revenue efforts by rationalizing tax rates \nand  thresholds  of  certain  taxes,  and  introducing  a  new  tax.  These  reforms  will \nenable GOP to mobilize more own-tax revenue from the revenue base. \n\nthe  efficiency  of \n\nimproved \n\nthrough \n\n \n11. \nLessons. Punjab is one of the three states in India currently in an extremely poor fiscal \nsituation and, therefore, requires immediate assistance for fiscal consolidation. In October 2012, \nthe  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  similar  loan  for  the  state  of  West  Bengal.15 During \nprocessing, the program drew on lessons from  all  previous  loans,  including  the  West Bengal  \n \n\n                                                \n14 Normative power requirements imply maximum quantum of free power allowed for a consumer category. It will be \nestablished  on  the  basis  of  a  detailed  study  of  geographical  region,  rainfall,  cropping  pattern,  and  water  table \ndepths. \n\n15 ADB. 2012.

This is a continuous process to improve the program design for greater aid effectiveness.16 \nThree critical lessons are that (i) state government ownership to implement sensitive reforms is \nextremely  critical,  (ii)  capacity  development  support  is  essential  during  implementation,  and  \n(iii) active stakeholder consultation including a communication strategy can mitigate the risk of \nnonparticipation  by  stakeholders  and  address  vested  interests  that  may  risk  the  reform \nmomentum.  For  this  program,  stakeholder  consultations  with  industries,  academics,  and  the \nassociation of industries have been carried out and will continue throughout implementation. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nand more sustainable fiscal space in the state government. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nfast-disbursing policy reform program: \n\nADB and the GOP reached an agreement on the broad areas of ADB support under the \n\nThe impact will be improved capital investment in the state.

Reform  measures  will  include  \n(a) designing fiscal responsibility and budget management rules; (b) establishing \na fiscal policy and management unit (FPMU) in the state Finance Department to \ncarry  out  project  appraisal,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  to  improve  allocation  of \npublic  expenditures  based  on  certain  principles;  (c)  preparing  long-term  sector \nstrategies  in  selected  departments  along  with  road  maps  for  achievement  of \ngoals; and (d) preparing a departmental rolling MTEF for selected departments. \nThe  program  will  strengthen  the  state\u2019s  cash  management  system  to  ease \nborrowing  requirements  and  enhance  institutional  capacity  to  actively  manage \nstate  debt.  All  of these measures  will  serve  to generate fiscal  savings, which  in \nturn will support gradual increases in the capital outlay to GSDP ratio proposed \nunder the program. \nRationalized  expenditure  focusing  on  power  subsidies.  Power  subsidy \nrationalization \ninclude  \n(a) \nfor  agriculture  and \nincentivizing  efficient  uses  of  power,17 (b)  segregating  agriculture  feeder  lines \nand  using  the  agriculture  feeder  data  for  subsidy  calculation,  (c)  introducing \n100%  feeder  metering,  (d)  introducing  distribution  meters,  (e)  introducing  a \nsystem  of  power  demand  forecasting  and  management,  and  (f)  implementing  a \ndebt restructuring plan for PSPCL. \nImproved  revenue  efforts.  Revenue  efforts  will  be  strengthened  by  \n(a) introducing a profession tax, (b) reducing the threshold for tax deducted at the \nsource  on  works  contracts,  (c)  increasing  the  tax  rate  on  turnover  to  a \ncomparable level of other states, and (d) digitizing land records.18 \n\ntargeting  of  power  subsidies)  will \nrequirements \n\n(or \nintroducing  normative \n\nfree  power \n\nimproved \n\n \nThere are 22 policy actions proposed in the program distributed over three tranches (8 \n\n14. \n\n                                                \n16 For  example:  (i)  ADB.  2007.

Without  high  growth,  especially \nmanufacturing  growth,  the  commercial  state  tax  base  will  not  grow  commensurately  with  the \ncapital  investment  needs  of  the  state.  Thus,  the  program\u2019s  focus  on  higher  capital  investment \nwill have an indirect impact on revenue mobilization and fiscal space creation, in addition to the \ndirect impact channeled through the program outputs. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nKeeping  the  fiscal  deficit  at  a  sustainable  level  will  be  difficult  for  GOP  unless  it \ncontinues  to  reduce  development  expenditure,  despite  the  negative  impact  on  growth  and \ndevelopment.  Thus,  the  main  focus  of  the  program  is  to  help  the  state  stabilize  its  finances, \nwhich in turn will help it augment and sustain development financing. \n \n16. \nThe  program  will  help  the  state  to  launch  the  necessary  reforms  for  a  balanced  and \nsustainable fiscal trajectory over the medium-term, and to meet its development financing needs \n(capital investment). It will contribute to repositioning and strengthening the budget as the main \ntool  for  prioritizing  the  development  objectives.  Capital  outlay  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP  is \nexpected  to  rise  from  less  than  1%  in  FY2012  to  2.4%  by  FY2016  under  the  program.  The \nreforms under the program will generate fiscal savings equivalent of $766 million over 5 years \n(FY2014\u2013FY2018), and $180 million during FY2014\u2013FY2016, and thereby contribute to the twin \ngoals  of  sustainability  of  state  finances  and  sustainable  increase  in  development  spending. \nHowever,  a  development  financing  gap  (additional  capital  outlay  in  the  reform  scenario  net  of \nnew  fiscal  space  created  under  the  program)  of  approximately  $252  million  during  FY2014\u2013\nFY2016 will remain. ADB funds will help cover this gap.19 \n \n17. \nBased on (i) the request of the Government of India and (ii) the development financing \nrequirements of the policy reform program, ADB will provide a policy-based loan of $200 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other terms  and  conditions  as  set forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  A three-tranche \npolicy framework, consistent with the timings of various reforms, is envisaged. The distribution \nof  the  tranches  will  be  $50  million,  $50  million,  and  $100  million,  with  the  first  tranche  to  be \ndisbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  will  be  disbursed  approximately  18 \nmonths after loan effectiveness, and the third tranche will be disbursed approximately 7 months \nafter the second tranche disbursement. The government will relend the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the total loan amount in accordance with its arrangements for the transfer \nof external assistance to GOP. \n \nE. \n \n18. \nThe  Finance  Department  of  GOP  will  be  the  executing  agency;  the  department\u2019s \nsecretary  will  be  the  focal  point  for  matters  pertaining  to  the  program.  An  FPMU  will  be \n                                                \n19  A detailed simulation exercise of the state budget is presented in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) under alternative scenarios. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to \ndecline post FY2014 in the baseline scenario. The rate of decline in the fiscal deficit can be further enhanced if the \ncapital investment (capital outlay) is restricted to the baseline level of 2% (Table 2). However, this will delay much \nnecessary growth and development financing in Punjab. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n6\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nestablished with representatives from relevant government departments. \n \n19. \nThe FPMU, which will help line departments implement the program, will be headed by a \nsenior government official. The FPMU will be responsible for (i) coordinating and monitoring the \nprogram,  including  the  policy  actions;  (ii)  preparing  and  submitting  all  required  reports  to  the \nhigher  authorities  in  GOP  and  ADB;  (iii)  submitting  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB;  and \n(iv) helping implement the attached TA. \n \nThe  proposed  program  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  30  months.  Procurement, \n20. \nadvance  contracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2012,  as  amended  from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. ADB \nwill  monitor  program  implementation  through  periodic  progress  reports  and  will  field  regular \nmissions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n21. \nimprove fiscal management performance in the state. The TA has seven components: \n\nThe  TA  will  strengthen  the  key  institutions  responsible  for  implementing  the  reforms  to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPower  subsidy  targeting.  Help  implement  the  subsidy  rationalization  plan, \nincluding (a) carrying out technical analysis and surveys to determine normative \npower  consumption  for  agriculture,  and  (b)  conducting  a  public  awareness \ncampaign. \nRevenue  administration. \ninformation \ntechnology application for improving taxpayer services, and revenue forecasting \ntechniques. \nProject  appraisal  and  monitoring.  Help  establish  an  FPMU  in  the  Finance \nDepartment  to  provide  rigorous  medium-term  fiscal  programming  and  appraisal \nand evaluation of the state government projects, support the FPMU in designing \nmanuals  based  on  certain  principles,  and  strengthen  the  state\u2019s  internal  audit \nsystem. \n\nthe  profession \n\nImplement \n\ntax,  an \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Medium-term  expenditure  frameworks.  Provide  support  to  line  departments, \nas  well  as  to  relevant  Finance  Department  officials,  to  prepare  gender-\ndisaggregated  expenditure  incidence  analyses  and,  drawing  on these  analyses, \nprepare  relevant  MTEFs  based  on  the  long-term  sector strategies. This support \nfor  implementation  will  include  expert  advice  and  training,  and  assistance  with \ndesigning detailed guidelines in various areas. \nEmployee  database. Help the executing agency prepare a comprehensive and \nsex-disaggregated  database  for  employees  and  pensioners  of \nthe  state \ngovernment. \nDebt  management.  In line with the weaknesses identified in debt management \nin \nincluding  developing \nappropriate cash management strategies. \nInternal audit. Provide support to strengthen internal audit in the state. \n\nthe  state,  build  capacity \n\nfor  debt  management, \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n22. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $510,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  GOP  will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation \nand supplies, and other logistical support. \n \n23. \n\nThe  TA  implementation  arrangements  will  be  aligned  with  those  for  the  policy-based \n\n \n\n\floan.  The  FPMU  will  implement  the  TA  components;  the  program  steering  committee  will \nprovide  overall  supervision  and  coordination.  A  total  of  38  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy services will be required intermittently. A consulting firm will be engaged to recruit \nthe consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio  of  90:10.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nInformation and communication technology-driven initiatives are proposed to improve tax \ncompliance.  Introduction  of  project  appraisal  techniques  and  preparation  of  the  MTEFs  will \nrequire  sound  technical  knowledge.  The  conduct  of  the  surveys  to  determine  power  usage \nnorms for various crops will require sound technical knowledge about crop production, irrigation \ntechniques,  and  surveys.  Capacity  building  support  under  the  program  will  help  the  relevant \ndepartments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe economic analysis indicates that program benefits considerably outweigh the costs. \nThe  key  direct  benefits  considered  are  (i)  better  targeting  of  subsidies,  (ii)  better  allocation  of \nscarce  public  resources,  (iii)  improved  public  financial  management,  (iv)  improved  revenue \nefforts,  and  (v)  reduced  debt  service  burden  due  to  better  management  of  debt  and  fiscal \nconsolidation.  A  comparison  of  the  baseline  and  the  pro-growth  reform  program  scenarios \ndriven  by  higher  capital  outlay  shows  that  the  overall  fiscal  deficit  is  expected  to  be  reduced \nafter 5 years despite higher capital outlay (Table 2).20  \n \n\nEconomic \n\nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios \n(% of gross state domestic product) \n\nFY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018 \n\nItem \nBaseline Scenario  \n\nFiscal deficit \nCapital outlay \nDebt stock \n\nReform Scenario \n\nFiscal deficit \nCapital outlay \nFiscal deficit without \nadditional capital outlay \nDebt stock \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n31.6 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.1 \n2.0 \n31.7 \n \n3.0 \n2.0 \n\n3.0 \n2.0 \n31.2 \n \n3.1 \n2.2 \n\n2.9 \n\n31.3 \n\n2.8 \n2.0 \n30.7 \n \n3.2 \n2.4 \n\n2.8 \n\n31.1 \n\n2.7 \n2.0 \n30.1 \n \n2.9 \n2.5 \n\n2.4 \n\n30.6 \n\n2.5 \n2.0 \n29.3 \n \n2.7 \n2.5 \n\n2.2 \n\n30.0 \n\n \n26. \nFiscal space created under the program, resulting from expenditure rationalization and \nimproved revenue efforts, will contribute to this outcome. Moreover, the debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio \n                                                \n20 These  projections  will  be  revisited  while  preparing  the  MTFF  (Policy  Action  No.  17  under  the  third  tranche) \nfollowing  the  (i)  Fourteenth  Finance  Commission  Awards and  (ii) the expected  rollout  of the  goods  and  services \ntax. \n\n8\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nthe \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nwill  decline. 21  The  other  important  economic  benefit  of  the  program  is  the  promotion  of  a \ndevelopment  model  that  facilitates  conservation  of  natural  resources,  such  as  water,  by \ntargeting the power subsidy for agriculture in an efficient manner. \n \nC. \n \nAs  part  of  program  preparation,  a  governance  risk  assessment  was  conducted  in \n27. \naccordance  with \nimplementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption  Action  Plan.  The  assessment  was  complemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of \npossible  risk  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial  management.  The  assessment  found  some \nvulnerable areas that could affect the program. They include risks related to (i) political support \nand ownership of policy reforms by the state government and (ii) institutional dimensions of the \nprogram  (e.g.,  weak  capacity  in  relevant  institutions).  The  financial  assessment  found  several \nareas  of  concern:  (i)  lack  of  appraisal  and  evaluation  of  investment  projects,  (ii)  weak \nimplementation  and  moderate monitoring  protocols,  (iii)  inadequate  internal  audits,  and  (iv)  no \nalignment between sector goals and resource allocation.22 Accordingly, a detailed results-based \npublic sector management assessment was carried out, and these risks, especially in the areas \nof  evaluation  and  implementation,  are  being  addressed  through  the  policy  actions  and/or \nthrough the capacity development under the TA. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  the  program  are  positive.  The  program\u2019s \nspecial  emphasis  on  enhancing  investment  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure  is  clearly \ngeared  to  creating  employment  opportunities  and  protecting  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups. Moreover, the program will continue to support free power for families living below the \npoverty line. The health indicators for women and children in the state are weaker than in other \ndeveloped states due to ineffective delivery of public services, especially in rural areas (causing \nlarge rural\u2013urban divides) and lack of adequate budget allocations. This is manifested in many \nways.  For  example,  high  incidence  of  cancer,  sharp  rural\u2013urban  disparities  in  maternity  care, \ninstitutional  births,  postnatal  care,  and  child  immunization  in  Punjab  reflect  inadequate  health \nservices. Rectifying these problems becomes all the more challenging if the state government is \nunable  to  invest  in  a  targeted  manner.23 As  a  result,  the  program  will  be  designed  with  some \ngender elements to ensure that women receive benefits. The gender-responsive MTEFs, based \non  long-term  sector  goals,  are  expected  to  improve  targeting  of  public  expenditure,  especially \ngender-related allocation of scarce public resources. This will be ensured through MTEF policy \nactions  and  gender  responsive  expenditure  incidence  analysis.  The  MTEFs  will  be  revised \nannually. \n \nE. \n \n29. \npeoples\u2014are categorized as C. \n \n\nThe three safeguard categories\u2014environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n21  Details are provided in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Results-Based Public Sector Management Assessment Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n23  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n30.
