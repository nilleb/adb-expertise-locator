The  two\n2.\nchains together comprise 29 coral atolls and 5 islands about 3,700 kilometers from Hawaii. The\nRMI\u2019s total land area of 180 square kilometers, scattered over 2 million square kilometers of the\nPacific  makes  it  the  smallest  of  the  five  American-affiliated  Pacific  territories  in  Micronesia.  Its\nestimated population in 1999 was 50,840. About half of the people live in Majuro Atoll, about 20\npercent in Kwajalein Atoll, and the rest are scattered throughout the RMI.\n\n3.\nThe  RMI  has  an  aid-dependent  economy,  sustained  by  large  grants  from  the  United\nStates  (US).  In  an  effort  to  promote  economic  development,  greater  self-sufficiency,  and\nreduced  international  dependence,  the  Government,  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nassistance,  introduced  several  reform  measures.  These  measures  included  the  downsizing  of\nthe civil service and reduction of subsidies to enterprises. Current measures are to (i) develop\nthe economy, including the strengthening of the role of the private sector to stimulate economic\ngrowth; and (ii) increase income-generating opportunities for a large number of the population\u2019s\nvulnerable groups, especially women and the youth in the outer islands.\n\nThe shortage of well-trained skilled labor has been a major constraint to economic and\n4.\nsocial  development.  The  average  educational  level  of  the  labor  force  is  only  six  years  of\nschooling.  ADB  had  recommended  that  an  educated  and  well-trained  skilled  force  is  a\nprerequisite to increasing productive capacity and that the Government introduce reforms in the\neducation and training sectors that have received little attention in the past. At the same time,\nGovernment efforts to generate more jobs and income-generating opportunities for women and\nthe youth are constrained by the absence of employment and self-employment opportunities as\nwell as lack of employable skills, especially in the outer islands.\n\n5.\nThe Government has initiated several measures to improve the quality of education. At\nthe  elementary  school  level,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Basic  Education  Project.1  has  successfully  raised\nthe  low  level  of  academic  proficiency.  The  Government  now  plans  to  introduce  corresponding\nreforms  in  the  skills  training  sector  as  part  of  the  country\u2019s  overall  education  and  training\nreforms.  The  Government  has  developed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  rationalize  the  vocational\neducation  and  skills  training  system.  Under  this  plan,  skills  training  will  be  reorganized  into  a\ncomprehensive and integrated national training and certification system with involvement of the\nprivate sector and collaboration among training agencies.\n\n6.\nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  implement  the  new  vocational\neducation and skills training plan to develop a national vocational education and skills training\nsystem.\n\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1249(SF)-RMI: Basic Education Project, for $ 8.0 million, approved on 9 September 1993.\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n7.\nThe 1999 Pacific Human Development Report ranks the RMI eighth (down from fifth in\n1994)  among  the  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs),  with  a  human  development\nindex of 0.563. This was calculated from a composite measure of life expectancy at birth of 65\nyears, adult literacy rate of 74 percent, combined gross enrollment ratio of 72 percent, and real\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,882.2 With a human poverty index of 18.7, the\nRMI ranks eighth in terms of poverty among the 12 PDMCs. This reflects a composite of people\nnot  expected  to  survive  to  age  40  (13  percent),  illiterate  adults  (26  percent),  underweight\nchildren  under 5 (17 percent), and people without access to safe water (18 percent) or health\nservices  (5  percent).  The  low  ranking  status  of  the  RMI  reflects  the  poor  quality  of  education\navailable  and  the  high  cost  of  delivering  services  to  a  scattered  population.  The  shortage  of\nskilled people at all levels is a major barrier to economic development. Education attainment is\nlow,  with  average  years  of  schooling  being  only  8.5  years.  Important  factors  in  relation  to  this\nare low quality of elementary education and lack of access to education in the outer islands.\n\nDistribution  of  resources  and  of  incomes  lacks  regional  equity,  resulting  in  a  highly\n8.\ndualistic economy. In 1991, average per capita incomes in the capital were around three times\nhigher  than  those  in  the  outer  islands,  while  per  capita  incomes  in  the  wealthiest  quintile  of\nhouseholds  was  3.5  times  higher  than  those  in  the  poorest  quintile  of  households.  The  RMI\neconomy  grew  less  than  1  percent  in  1999  after  three  years  of  recession  caused  by  a\ncombination of drought and the short-term impacts of Government expenditure cuts associated\nwith the reform process. Real GDP remains low, approximately 25 percent less than in 1995. In\nper capita terms, current value GDP fell by over 17 percent in the same period.\n\n9.\nDespite a downward trend, inflation has been relatively high, averaging 5.5 percent per\nannum  in  1995-1999.  Although  exports  fell  by  6  percent  in  1995-1998,  imports  also  fell  by  24\npercent in the same period, resulting in a decline in the trade deficit. The fiscal situation remains\nprecarious partly due to reduction in import tax rate and past due obligations. Oil price increases\nare  expected  to  have  an  impact,  and  the  new  Government  is  saddled  with  financial\ncommitments made by the previous government, including purchase of new aircraft. Some relief\nmay  be  possible  from  increase  in  fishing  revenue,  further  public  service  downsizing,  and\nbilateral  funding.  Despite  the  short-term  political  and  personal  costs,  there  has  been\nimprovement in governance, particularly since the new Government took office. New legislation\nhas  been  prepared  to  simplify  the  processes  associated  with  private  sector  investment.  The\nquality  of  economic  management  in  the  coming  years  will  be  crucial  to  ensure  sustainable\neconomic growth into the future.\n\n10. Women  are  disadvantaged  in  all  areas  of  the  economy  and  society  despite  the  mainly\nmatrilineal society. Female literacy rates are around 13 percent lower than those of men. Few\nwomen are in senior positions of leadership in Government and women\u2019s and infant health is a\nkey area of concern; in fact infant mortality, total fertility, and teenage fertility rates in the RMI\nare the highest of all PDMCs, while contraceptive use is among the lowest. The high fertility rate\nhas a follow-on impact on the general health of women.\n\n                                                          \n2 UNDP. 1999. Pacific Human Development Report::Creating Opportunities.\n\n\f3\n\nA.\n\nThe Education Sector\n\n1.\n\n Elementary Education\n\nThe structure of education consists of eight years of elementary schooling (grades 1 to\n11.\n8)  followed  by  four  years  of  high  school  (grades  9  to  12).  Elementary  education  is  mandatory\nwhile  entry  into  secondary  education  is  subject  to  competitive  entrance  examinations.  Public\nand private schools provide both levels of education.\n\n12.\nIn  school  year  2000  (SY2000),  the  RMI  had  104  elementary  schools  and  a  total\nenrollment  of  11,687.  Female  students  were  almost  equally  represented,  accounting  for  about\n48.5  percent  (5,669  students)  of  all  elementary  students.  The  elementary  schools  had  632\nteachers. The teacher student ratio was 1:20 in public elementary schools and 1:15 in private\nelementary schools.\n\n13.\nElementary schools are few and far between and are available in only 24 of the 29 atolls,\nwith 10 atolls having only one elementary school each.3 Because the RMI\u2019s population is highly\ndispersed, the schools are small in size, averaging an enrollment of 112 students. Many schools\nin  the  outer  islands  have  less  than  50  students  in  grades  1  to  8.  Often,  one  or  two  teachers\nteach  all  the  grades  in  these  schools.  Because  of  the  long  distances  involved  in  walking  to\nschool and the difficult geographical and weather conditions in the islands, many children do not\nattend  school.  Despite  compulsory  elementary  education,  school  participation  rates  are  low,\nwith about 3,500 children 6-14 (30 percent) not attending school.\n\n2.\n\nSecondary Education\n\n14.\nAt  the  end  of  grade  8,  students  take  a  national  test  to  gain  entry  into  high  schools.\nSecondary education is available only in four atolls (Kwajalein and Majuro have five and eight\nhigh  schools,  respectively,  while  Jaluit  and  Wotje  have  one  each).  There  are  only  3  public\nschools  among  the  18  high  schools  in  the  country.  The  total  enrollment  in  public  and  private\nschools was 2,498 in SY2000. Female students were well represented at the secondary level,\naccounting  for  49  percent  of  total  enrollment.  The  high  schools  had  187  teachers,  providing  a\ngenerous  teacher  student-ratio  of  1:14.  High  schools  are  also  small  in  enrollment  with  an\naverage of about 140 students in grades 9 to 12. Students in the outer islands who gain entry\ninto  high  schools  migrate  to  Ebeye  or  Majuro  to  continue  their  studies,  or  cease  schooling.\nStatistical data on education is at Appendix 1.\n\n15.\nOnly about 35-40 percent of students who take the entrance test in grade 8 are admitted\ninto the limited places in high schools. In 1998, of the 1,218 students who took the tests, only\n481  (39.5  percent)  were  admitted  into  grade  9.  Similarly,  in  1999,  only  488  students  (35.3\npercent) of the 1,384 who took the test gained admission. The high rate of failures is also the\nresult of the low level of educational achievement at the elementary level where students\u20194 basic\ncompetencies  are  poor  in  many  subjects,  including  English,  mathematics,  and  science.  About\n1,460 children of the 15-18 age group do not attend school.\n\n                                                          \n3 Under the ADB-assisted Basic Education Project, a middle school for 720 students is being constructed to increase\n\nstudent enrollment.\n\n4 ADB-assisted Basic Education Project is addressing some of the weaknesses in elementary education.\n\n\f4\n\n3. \n\nSchool Dropouts\n\n16.\nThe  school  dropout  rate  is  high  at  all  levels.  Results  from  ongoing  National  Standards\nBureau  monitoring  of  student  enrollment  show  that  there  are  approximately  30  percent  of\nincoming  first  graders  who  dropout  before  grade  eight  and  approximately  57  percent  of\nincoming  ninth  graders  in  high  school  drop  out  before  graduation.  The  data  suggests  that  of\nevery  100  students  who  begin  grade  1,  about  13  will  graduate  from  high  school.  The  1999\ncensus  recorded  that  30.5  percent  of  students  enrolled  elementary  schools  do  not  attend\nschool.  The  dropout  rate  is  particularly  high  at  the  end  of  the  elementary  level  when  students\ntake  the  high  school  entrance  test.  The  number  admitted  depends  on  the  number  of  places\navailable, which are allotted to the top-scoring examinees.\n\n4.\n\nPostsecondary Education\n\na.\n\nCollege of the Marshall Islands\n\nPostsecondary  education  is  provided  in  the  College  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (CMI)  in\n17.\nMajuro. CMI is an autonomous community college providing two- and three-year programs for\nstudents in the Micronesian region. CMI is the designated postsecondary institution for the RMI\nresponsible for the development of human resources in a number of areas. CMI has been fully\naccredited  by  the  Western  Association  of  Schools  and  Colleges.  CMI\u2019s  main  campus  is  in\nMajuro where the college offers associate degree and certificate programs in teacher education,\nliberal arts, and vocational and occupational education and training. In the fall semester of 1999,\nthere was a total of approximately 650 students attending part-time and full-time courses. In that\nsame  year,  58  students  graduated  with  associate  degrees.  Other  programs  include  the  adult\neducation program, which offers youth and adults a second opportunity to complete high school\neducation,  or  attend  postsecondary  training  to  have  a  better  chance  for  employment.  English\nand mathematics are taught to make trainees functionally literate to help them pass the General\nEquivalency  Diploma.  Since  SY1993,  1,726  students  have  participated  in  these  courses  and\n246  gained  the  diploma.  A  total  of  91  students  gained  employment  or  improved  their\nemployment  position  while  another  206  went  on  to  other  education  and  training  programs  in\nCMI, colleges in the US, and the Job Corps Program. CMI\u2019s profile is in Appendix 2.\n\n18.\nCMI  runs  a  branch  campus  in  Ebeye  where  it  offers  associate  degree  and  certificate\nprograms  similar  to  those  in  the  main  campus  in  Majuro.  Courses  include  nursing,  business,\naccounting,  management,  computer,  education,  engineering,  and  liberal  arts.  In  the  spring\nsemester  of  2000,  CMI  had  108  part-time  and  full-time  students,  including  52  females  and  56\nmales.  The  branch  campus  opened  in  1996  and  is  in  an  early  stage  of  development.  It  has\ngraduated 3 students.\n\nOver  the  years,  CMI  has  been  expanding  its  facilities  on  its  two  campuses  through\n19.\nGovernment  support  and  its  own  initiative.  In  1998,  ADB  provided  assistance  under  the  Basic\nEducation Project to build a dormitory for about 30 teachers from the outer islands. CMI added a\nbuilding with offices for the staff. CMI has upgraded its Ebeye campus where it refurbished the\nsix  classrooms  of  an  abandoned  elementary  school  building  close  to  the  campus.  It  also\npurchased  and  rehabilitated  two  unoccupied  houses  to  provide  accommodation  for  its  staff  to\nattract teachers to the campus in the remote island.\n\n\f5\n\nb. \n\nUniversity of the South Pacific Branch in Majuro\n\n20.\nThe  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP)  has  a  university  center  in  Majuro.  USP  was\nestablished in 1968 by 12 island countries in the Pacific. Marshallese high school students with\nhigh grade point averages are admitted to USP\u2019s one-year preparatory program for admission\ninto  colleges  in  the  Pacific,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand.  Several  promising  students  have\nbenefited from these programs.\n\n5.\n\nVocational Education in High Schools\n\n21.\nVocational  education  is  provided  mainly  in  the  RMI\u2019s  three  public  schools:  Marshall\nIslands  high  school  (MIHS)  in  Majuro,  Jaluit  high  school  in  Jaluit,  and  Northern  Islands  high\nschool  in  Wotje.  Vocational  education  comprises  prevocational  education  in  grades  9  and  10\nand vocational education electives in grades 11 and 12. Prevocational education is designed to\nintroduce  students  to  the  work  environment  and  the  various  vocational  options  open  to  them.\nStudents are expected to learn simple skills, use of tools, and production processes to enable\nthem  to  grasp  vocational  concepts  in  several  occupational  areas.  These  include  agriculture,\nfood  preservation,  elementary  construction,  cooking,  sewing,  gardening,  and  fishing.  But\nbecause of inadequate funding and resources, the programs have not been very effective, and\nstudents are not prepared and motivated for vocational electives in grades 11 and 12.\n\n22.\nVocational education electives are aimed at equipping students with occupational skills\nand  developing  their  aesthetic  and  intellectual  skills  to  enable  them  to  participate  in  personal,\nfamily,  community,  and  national  affairs.  A  wide  range  of  vocational  electives  is  offered.  They\ninclude agriculture, auto mechanics, basic electricity, bookkeeping, childcare, typing, shorthand,\nspeedwriting,  construction,  cooking,  sewing,  drafting,  economics,  general  business,  home\neconomics,  home  garden  skills,  home  maintenance  and  repair,  small  appliance  repair,  and\nwoodworking.  The  number  of  students  in  most  vocational  elective  courses  is  small  although\nsome courses (such as home economics, computer, and agriculture) have higher enrollments.\nVocational  education  is,  therefore,  not  cost  effective.  A  few  private  schools  (e.g.,  Assumption\nhigh  school  in  Majuro,  the  Queen  of  Peace  high  school,  and  the  Seventh  Day  Adventist  high\nschool  in  Ebeye)  offer  limited  vocational  education  in  home  economics,  secretarial  services,\nwoodwork, sewing, and auto mechanics.\n\n23.\nIn addition to vocational education, high schools also run a school-to-work program that\nduplicates much of the vocation education programs in grades 9 to 12. It also results in wastage\nof scarce resources, low quality of vocational education, and significantly reduced teaching time\nfor academic subjects.\n\n6.\n\nSkills Training\n\na. \n\nJob Training Partnership Act Programs\n\n24.\nSkills training in the nonformal sector is funded by the US federal government under the\nJob Training Partnership Act (JTPA), which was established to provide Marshallese, who face\nsevere labor market constraints, with support and training to increase their opportunities to find\nemployment.\n\nJTPA programs, which were run in collaboration with CMI, provided training and services\n25.\nto participants and maintained a close relationship with ongoing development programs. JTPA\nalso  provided  school  alternative  programs  whereby  dropouts  were  able  to  improve  their\n\n\f6\n\neducational  competencies  and  return  to  mainstream  education.  JTPA  received  an  annual\nbudget of about $800,000 and operated a wide range of programs, which were provided in the\ntwo CMI training centers in Ebeye and Majuro. The courses included automotive mechanics, air\nconditioning  and  refrigeration,  building  maintenance,  carpentry  and  construction,  electricity,\nsecretarial,  sewing,  and  welding.  During  1994-1999,  about  1,620  youths  and  adults,  including\n543  females  (33.5  percent),  participated  in  seven  JTPA  programs:  occupational  skills  training,\ninstitutional  skills  training,  cooperative  work  experience,  entrepreneurship  and  small  business\noperation, preemployment work maturity skills training, school enhancement, and summer youth\nemployment and training. A total of 393 youth and adults including 84 females were placed in\nemployment. Nineteen students including 10 females gained places in high schools. The JTPA\nprograms closed in June 2000 and were replaced by the Work Investment Act (WIA) program.\n\n7.\n\nWork Investment Act\n\n26.\nSpecifically,  the  WIA  facilitates  training  to  produce  a  skilled  workforce  based  on\nnationally  recognized  skill  standards  and  strives  to  maximize  the  use  and  management  of  the\ncountry\u2019s  natural  and  human  resources.  WIB\u2019s  main  tasks  are  to  (i)  increase  self-reliance  of\nMarshallese,  (ii)  reduce  dependence  on  outside  resources  and  aid  through  the  provision  of\nservices  and  training  programs  tailored  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  individual  and  public  and\nprivate sectors, and (iii) foster collaboration among related agencies. When the WIA came into\neffect, the Government set up the Work Investment Board (WIB) in August 2000 to administer\nthe WIA and meet its requirements.\n\n27. WIB  supports  summer  employment  opportunities,  work  experience,  occupational  skill\ntraining,  leadership  development  opportunities,  and  guidance  and  counseling.  It  supports\nentrepreneurial activities with \u201cincubator\u201d entrepreneurial projects by providing equipment, rent,\ntransportation,  materials,  and  start-up  assistance.  This  will  provide  on-the-job  training  for\nentrepreneurs  in  business  skills  and  act  as  a  showcase  for  educating  the  masses  in\nentrepreneurial  and  self-employment  opportunities.  WIB  also  supports  the  alternative  school\nprograms,  which  enable  dropouts  and  delinquent  youth  to  return  to  school.  To  foster  greater\nself-reliance, WIB supports local governments interested in developing sustainable agriculture,\nfishing, and other subsistence activities in the outer islands.\n\n28. WIB operates through one-stop centers, which are responsible for developing programs\nand  identifying  suitable  training  providers  to  conduct  training  on  behalf  of  WIB.  The  one-stop\ncenters  provide  comprehensive  services  to  trainees,  trained  workers,  employers,  and  training\nproviders.  The  centers  do  not  conduct  any  training  themselves  but  commission  training\nproviders  to  do  so.  They  also  assist  and  advise  potential  trainees  to  find  suitable  training\nvenues,  help  trained  workers  find  jobs,  and  assist  employers  to  find  suitably  trained  workers.\nWIB has set up a one-stop center at Majuro. Another center will be built on the CMI campus in\nEbeye,  which  is  the  second  largest  populated  area  and  a  significant  employment  market  for\ntrained  skilled  workers  for  the  contractor  who  provides  human  resources  to  the  US  Kwajalein\nMissile  Range.  Two  subcenters  are  also  planned  for  Jaluit  and  Wotje.  The  subcenters  will  be\nthe focal points for planning all outer islands training. This decentralized approach will allow the\nflexibility  needed  to  assess  and  address  the  unique  conditions  of  the  varied  social,  economic,\neducational, and training needs of the RMI. WIB staff will head each of the one-stop centers and\nsubcenters, and the director of the one-stop center in Majuro will coordinate the activities of all\nfour centers. Programs available in the RMI are in Appendix 3.\n \n\n\f7\n\n8.\n\nSkills Training Centers\n\n29.\nCMI is the primary skills training provider in the RMI. It conducts skills training for mid-\nlevel skills workers in its two centers in Ebeye and Majuro. CMI has experience in conducting\ntraining  under  the  JTPA  programs  and  is  currently  upgrading  its  training  and  educational\nfacilities  in  both  campuses  to  (i)  meet  the  new  requirements  of  the  WIA  and  provide  better\ntraining programs in order to qualify for assistance under the WIA, and (ii) maintain its status of\nfull accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1999, CMI converted\nan abandoned cafeteria of the MIHS at Rita into a center for training skilled workers.\n\n30.\nSkills training is also available at the CMI Ebeye campus. The campus is housed in an\nold  and  large  renovated  two-storied  military  building.  There  are  currently  seven  classrooms,  a\ncomputer  room,  a  students\u2019  lounge,  a  bookstore,  and  four  administration  offices.  The  campus\nruns  skills  training  courses  in  carpentry,  electricity,  and  secretarial  services.  The  college\ncollaborates with the training staff on the military base in Kwajalein to develop training programs\nand place students for on-the-job training, and draws part-time teachers from among the staff of\nthe base.\n\n31.\nCMI has prepared to assume its role as the leading skills training provider in the RMI by\nrenovating  the  abandoned  high  school  cafeteria  at  Rita  in  Majuro  into  a  training  center  and\nexpanding its modest facilities at its Ebeye Training Center, and designating a senior CMI staff\nmember  as  the  director  of  skills  training.  The  director  will  be  responsible  for  the  planning,\ncoordination, and delivery of all CMI skills training. CMI has also designated two members of its\nstaff  as  the  managers  of  the  training  centers  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje.  CMI  is  thus  adequately\nprepared to meet the challenges of the new skills development program.\n\n9.\n\nTechnician Training\n\nPostsecondary  programs  for  training  technicians  are  offered  at  CMI  and  its  branch\n32.\ncampus in Ebeye. The main campus in Majuro runs associate degree and certificate vocational\nand occupational courses in nursing, business, and occupational trades. Two-year programs in\nbusiness  studies  and  office  administration  lead  to  the  Associate  of  Science  Degree.  The\nbusiness  studies  and  office  administration  course  includes  management,  accounting,  and\ncomputer science and is designed for those who wish to work in the business sector. The office\nadministration  course  prepares  students  for  careers  in  a  business  office  environment  and\nincludes  training  in  keyboarding,  office  procedures,  word  processing,  interpersonal  skills,\nbusiness English, business mathematics, organizational skills, and accounting. The Department\nof  Vocational  and  Occupational  Education  provides  two-year  programs  in  architectural\nengineering  leading  to  the  Associate  of  Science  Degree  and  an  individualized  education\nprogram leading to an Associate of Science Degree in automotive technology or building trades.\n\nThe CMI campus in Ebeye also offers postsecondary programs for training technicians,\n\n33.\nsimilar to programs offered in the main campus in Majuro.\n\n10.\n\nTeacher and Instructor Training\n\n34.\nTeachers  and  instructors  for  vocational  education  and  skills  training  programs  are\nrecruited  in  several  ways.  Some  are  graduates  of  CMI,  others  are  recruited  through  open\nadvertisement, and others are trained in the Guam Community College,  which recently moved\nfrom Guam to Palau. This college was set up in 1994 to train teachers for nine island countries\nin  the  region,  including  the  RMI,  under  the  US-funded  Instructor  Development  Program  of  the\n\n\f8\n\nPacific Regional Educational Laboratory, with headquarters in Hawaii. The program focuses on\nvocational  curriculum  development  and  instructor  training  in  a  broad  range  of  vocational\nsubjects  at  the  secondary  school  level.  The  RMI  receives  about  $120,000  annually  under  the\nUS  federal  grant  for  vocational  education  and  this  is  used  to  train  about  four  teachers  every\nyear.  Teachers  attend  vocational  training  and  pedagogic  courses  for  eight  weeks  during\nsummer vacations for four consecutive years to qualify for an associate degree. Seven teachers\nfrom  public  high  schools  in  the  RMI  have  received  associate  degrees  under  this  program.\nPrivate schools do not receive any assistance to train teachers.\n\n11.\n\nSkills Training for Women and Youth\n\n35.\nThe  Women\u2019s  Division  in  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  is  responsible  for  promoting\nequality  and  gender  awareness  in  the  community,  coordinating  training  programs  to  support\nimprovements in women\u2019s lives, monitoring the status of women in the RMI, and acting as the\nfocal point for all support and assistance to women. The Women\u2019s Division works closely with\nthe  National  Council  of  Women.  A  major  activity  of  the  Women\u2019s  Division  is  implementing  the\nWomen\u2019s National Policy, which aims to improve the health and educational status and welfare\nof women. Prior to budget cuts under the Public Sector Reform Program, the Women\u2019s Division\norganized several training programs and conducted training and income-generating activities for\nwomen\u2019s groups throughout the islands. Now, without funds, the Women\u2019s Division acts mainly\nas  a  clearing  house  and  a  meeting  place  for  the  National  Council  of  Women  and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Traditional attitudes continue to influence the level and\nscope of women\u2019s participation in economic growth and social development.\n\nThe health and education profile of the RMI is discouraging and compares with those of\n36.\nmuch poorer countries. The poor health of the population is due to poor nutrition; approximately\n56.5 percent of adults aged 18-50 years are overweight or obese.5 One in two adults is likely to\ndevelop symptoms of diabetes and similar illnesses. The overall life expectancy in the Marshall\nIslands is 68 years\u201466 years for males and 69 years for females\u2014both well below average life\nexpectancies  in  many  neighboring  island  countries.  In  recent  years,  domestic  violence  due  to\nalcohol abuse and other forms of violence against women have increased.\n\n37. With  the  budget  cut  in  the  Women\u2019s  Division  and  elsewhere,  the  training  and  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  open  to  women  was  reduced.  In  the  outer  islands,  subsistence\nagriculture,  handicrafts,  and  coastal  fisheries,  combined  with  the  traditional  extended  family\nsystem,  help  to  maintain  a  social  safety  mechanism  to  ensure  the  basic  needs  of  food  and\nshelter.  With  reduced  income  levels  and  fewer  job  opportunities  island  communities  are  now\nmotivated  to  revive  subsistence  activities  for  consumption  and  sale,  and  to  exploit  island\nresources. But the communities need adequate management, entrepreneurial, and other skills\nto  do  this.  In  the  island  communities,  women  facilitate  and  supplement  the  subsistence  living\nstandards by ensuring that family obligations to the community are met while the household is\nkept  together.  Handicraft  production  has  been  a  perennial  activity  especially  for  women,  and\nsupplements income from copra and coastal fishing. After the public reform period, the onus is\neven greater for women to ensure that community and family obligations are met.\n\n12.\n\nAdministration of Education\n\n38.\nThe  responsibility  for  the  overall  development  and  administration  of  education  at  all\nlevels, including technical and vocational education, lies with the Ministry of Education (MOE).\n\n                                                          \n5 Findings from a survey conducted by John Hopkins University between 1996 and 1997.\n\n\f9\n\nMOE  is  headed  by  a  minister,  assisted  by  the  secretary  of  education  who  administers  and\nimplements Government education policies and oversees the administration of education in the\ncountry.  The  National  Board  of  Education  advises  the  minister  on  public  school  curricula,\neducation  standards,  CMI,  and  other  education  matters.  MOE  is  divided  into  three  bureaus,\neach  headed  by  an  undersecretary:  (i)  the  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Bureau  is\nresponsible  for  the  development  of  school  education  including,  prevocational  and  vocational\neducation  and  training,  school  liaison,  and  logistic  support  to  schools;  (ii)  the  Curriculum  and\nInstructional Services Bureau is responsible for the design and development of curriculum and\ninstructional  materials;  and  (iii)  the  Administration  and  Instructional  Support  Services  is\nresponsible  for  administration  and  finance.  The  three  directorates  in  the  Elementary  and\nSecondary  Education  Bureau  are  responsible  for  elementary,  secondary,  and  vocational\neducation. The director of vocational education is responsible for vocational education programs\nin  schools.  Currently,  he  is  the  only  staff  person  in  the  department  dealing  directly  with\nvocational education. The MOE organization chart is in Appendix 4.\n\n13.\n\nFinancing of Education\n\nMOE\u2019s annual budget is made of a mix of Compact6 funds and specific education grants.\n39.\nCurrently, MOE receives funding for education from a number of sources, the main ones being\nthe General Fund, Compact Tied Fund, Special Revenue Fund, and Federal Fund. The General\nFund primarily supports several administrative and monitoring divisions of MOE and elementary\neducation. The Compact Tied Fund provides annual grants of $1.8 million mainly for financing\nthe RMI\u2019s three public high schools. The Compact Fund also provides about $797,000 annually\nin scholarships to Marshallese to study in US colleges. The Federal Fund is given for specific\nprograms  such  as  assisting  handicapped  children,  preschooling,  and  training.  In  1998,  MOE\nreceived a total of $1.48 million from all funds including $1.33 million for recurrent expenditure. It\nreceived $1.5 million for capital expenditure. About 75 percent of the General Fund is spent on\nelementary  education,  only  2  percent  on  secondary  education,  and  22  percent  on\npostsecondary education. MOE\u2019s budget is provided in Appendix 5.\n\n40.\nThe budget for vocational education and skills training programs comes largely from the\nGeneral Fund, Compact Tied Fund, and Federal Fund. An exact breakdown of expenditure on\nvocational  education  is  not  available  as  it  is  included  in  the  secondary  education  allotment.\nEstimates  indicate  that  in  FY1999,  the  Directorate  of  Vocational  Education  in  MOE  received\n$120,000 for vocational programs in the three public schools, while the JTPA received $840,000\nfor its programs. The National Training Council (NTC) gets its funding from the levy imposed on\nforeign nationals working in the RMI, which has averaged about $180,000 annually. NTC also\nreceives  aid  from  international  bodies  such  as  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP) which provided assistance to develop skill standards in a few trade areas. CMI received\nabout $900,000 in FY1999. For FY2000, the Government had proposed a budget of the same\namount for all the allocations.\n\n41.\nCMI\u2019s main revenue is from tuition fees (61 percent in FY1999), which are $95 per credit\nfor a resident student and $105 per nonresident student. The rest is from Government subsidy\nand  other  income,  which  in  1999  amounted  to  $2,364  per  student.  Most  students  receive\nFederal Pell Grants, the maximum for which is $3,300 per year In FY1998, the Department of\nVocational  and  Occupational  Trade  spent  $89,480.  In  1996,  CMI  established  the  Endowment\nTrust Fund toward achieving financial stability of the college. CMI is targeting $20 million, which\nwill enable it to be self sustaining and less dependent on US federal scholarship programs and\n\n                                                          \n6 Compact of Free Association with the US.\n\n\f10\n\nfluctuating  annual  local  appropriations.  CMI  estimates  that  when  the  target  of  $20  million  is\nreached, it will be able to finance about 80 percent of its current operating expenditure through\nreturns  on  investments.  To  date,  the  Endowment  Trust  Fund  has  about  $200,000.  CMI  is\nseeking US nonprofit status, which would make contributions to the Endowment Trust Fund tax-\nexempt for US citizens.\n\n14.\n\nEconomic and Labor Market Considerations\n\na.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\n42.\nThe  RMI  may  be  divided  into  four  distinct  economic  areas:  Majuro,  the  capitol  and\nlargest  population  center;  Ebeye,  in  Kwajalein  Atoll,  the  second  largest  population  center  and\nthe  site  of  the  missile  testing  range  for  the  US  army;  subcenters  of  Jaluit  and  Wotje;  and  the\nremaining \u201couter islands,\u201d which are home to approximately one third of the population.\n\n43.\nAn  economic  goal  of  the  Government  is  greater  self-sufficiency  in  agriculture.  The\noverall strategic objective for the development of agriculture is to optimize the generation of in-\nkind  and  monetary  income  (i.e.,  food  and  cash)  from  agriculture.  Another  goal  is  to  develop\nfisheries  marine  resources.  Majuro  has  established  a  fish  processing  (\u201cloining\u201d)  plant,  which\nemploys  320  workers.  Ebeye  has  built,  with  Japanese  aid,  a  fish  market  that  imports  fish  and\nsells  local  produce  from  three  neighboring  atolls,  Ailinglaplap,  Likiep,  and  Namu,  which  have\nbuilt  fish  holding  centers  in  their  atolls.  Arno,  a  neighbor  atoll  to  Majuro,  has  completed  a  fish\nbase  (facilities  for  landing,  sorting,  and  storing  fish  catches).  Jaluit  is  in  the  process  of\nconstructing a fish base and plans are set for the atolls of Mili and Aur to build bases in the near\nfuture.\n\n44.\nEcotourism,  the  third  priority  of  the  Government,  is  still  largely  in  the  planning  stages.\nMajuro  has  a  resort,  and  Bikini  has  a  dive  resort.  Other  ecotourism  plans  are  being  made  for\nJaluit,  Kwajalein,  and  Mili  atolls.  The  Ministry  of  Resources  and  Development  is  also\ninvestigating the feasibility of pearl farming.7 Throughout the RMI, there is a pressing need for\nmore and better-trained teachers.\n\nThe  completion  and  start  up  of  new  retail  stores  in  Majuro  seems  to  indicate  an\n45.\nexpansion  in  retail  related  employment.  In  addition,  transportation  and  related  industries  and\nservices  will  continue  to  increase,  particularly  as  the  population  and  businesses  can  only  find\nland further out long the 50 kilometer (km) stretch of the atoll. In the past year, three new car\ndealerships have opened in the capitol. As the outer islands develop fisheries, more vessels will\nbe needed, and as the RMI\u2019s airline increases its capacity to serve the outer islands, a variety of\nemployees will be needed to support this expansion. Skilled workers will be required in all these\nareas.\n\n46.\nIn addition, initial surveys from the private sector indicated the need for higher level or\nmid-to-upper level training to enable Marshallese to replace nonlocal personnel. An associated\nproblem  is  that  while  many  students  do  go  abroad  for  higher  education,  few  of  them  return  to\nthe RMI, preferring to remain in the United States. Their places need to be filled too.\n\n47.\nEbeye Island is 5 km from the main island for the Kwajalein Missile Range and provides\nthe Marshallese labor force for the island. The Raytheon Company, which is contracted by the\nUS  army,  employs  over  1,000  Marshallese  in  a  variety  of  positions.  No  large  expansion  is\n\n                                                          \n7 Interview with Ministry of Resources and Development personnel, February 2000.\n\n\f11\n\nexpected  to  take  place;  however,  wide  range  of  entry-level  jobs  are  available,  from  trades  to\nfood  service,  and  need  to  be  filled  on  an  ongoing  basis  as  employees  leave  their  jobs  for\nvarious reasons. However, although some Marshallese have risen to positions of responsibility\nafter an extended period of time, few are in managerial or technical positions largely due to the\nlack  of  qualifications.  CMI,  in  collaboration  with  the  Raytheon  training  staff,  has  begun  to\naddress  this  problem  with  a  training  program  that  has  successfully  placed  two  graduates  in\ncomputer  technician  positions,  one  graduate  in  the  engineering  master  planner\u2019s  office,  and\nseveral in secretarial positions previously occupied by Americans. Jobs Corps operates a center\non  Kwajalein,  which  prepares  Marshallese  youth  for  transfer  to  US  Job  Corps  sites  for  further\ntraining.  Many  out-of-school  youth,  however,  cannot  take  advantage  of  this  opportunity  due  to\ntheir extremely low competency in English.\n\nEconomic development on Ebeye is limited due to the population density of the island.\n48.\nThe  scarcity  of  land  limits  construction  of  new  buildings.  However,  many  services,  from  air-\nconditioning repair and maintenance and other maintenance-related jobs need to be developed.\nThere are plans to build a dive resort to capitalize on the various World War II wrecks and other\nexcellent diving opportunities found in the lagoon; however, these plans remain on the drawing\nboard.\n\n49.\nJaluit  has  made  good  progress  toward  establishing  the  infrastructure  for  further\neconomic  development.  Its  power  plant  is  operating  and  can  of  support  continued  economic\nexpansion, and its wharf is in good condition and capable of docking the larger ships that travel\nto  and  from  the  centers.  Communication  by  satellite  phone  and  facsimile  has  also  been\nestablished. A fishery is being established and plans are being made for an ecoresort. Marshalls\nEnergy  Company  has  plans  for  a  power  plant  in  Wotje.  Wotje,  which  has  some  of  the  most\nfertile soil in the RMI, is planning on increasing agriculture output by diversifying its production\nof food crops.\n\nEconomic  activity  on  the  outer  islands  is  still  mainly  at  the  subsistence  level  although\n50.\nsome initiatives have been taken to develop the economy. These initiatives mostly involve food\nproduction and fish catch to be exported to the centers of Ebeye and Majuro. A major initiative\nin the outer islands is development of alternative energy sources. Three of the outer islands are\nalready  using  solar  power  to  provide  electricity.    This  push  for  alternative  energy  sources  will\nnecessitate,  in  turn,  the  development  of  supply  and  distribution  centers  in  the  major  atolls  to\nsupport them. The Government is cognizant of the importance of economic development in the\nouter  islands  as  a  means  to  slow  or  reverse  migration  to  the  urban  centers  and  the  resulting\neconomic  and  social  problems  that  this  migration  causes.  The  legislature  has  passed  a  bill,\nwhich  will  make  Enewetak,  the  RMI\u2019s  westernmost  atoll,  the  country\u2019s  third  port  of  entry.\nInfrastructure development and training of personnel to operate the port will provide a significant\nnumber of job opportunities.\n\nb.\n\nLabor Force\n\n51.\nThe  size  of  the  working  age  population  (people  aged  15  years  and  older)  is  about\n28,700: 14,600 males and 14,100 females. The economically active population of the total labor\nforce  is  about  14,700  people\u20149,679  males  (66  percent  of  all  males)  and  4,908  females  (35\npercent  of  all  females).  In  1999,  private  employment  comprised  40.6  percent  of  the  total\nemployed  population;  Government,  30.6  percent;  and  self-employment,  25.8  percent.  The\nremaining 3 percent were employers, unpaid, and paid workers in family businesses.\n\n\f12\n\nThe total number of employed persons, based on the 1999 census, is 10,141 which is\n52.\n69.1 percent of the total labor force. The unemployed comprises 30.9 percent of the total labor\nforce. This is more than double the unemployment rate in 1988, which was 12.5 percent. In fact,\nthe  total  number  employed  in  1999  is  almost  the  same  as  1988.  The  increase  in  the\nunemployment rate is probably the result of the lack of new jobs as well as downsizing of the\nGovernment  workforce.  The  unemployment  rate  for  females  was  37.3  percent  and  for  males,\n27.6 percent.\n\nThe  total  lack  of  employment  growth  between  1988  and  1999,  when  vast  sums  were\n53.\nbeing  spent  on  stimulating  economic  growth,  suggests  that  it  will  be  difficult  to  find  even  a\nfraction of the jobs needed to achieve an equilibrium between the 800-1,000 job seekers a year\nand  available  job  opportunities.  With  expanded  markets  for  atoll-lagoon  marine  products,  tuna\ntransshipment services, and tourism (all of which are far from certain to occur), the potential for\nnew jobs is in the range of 100-300 a year, except for projects such as the new fish processing\n(\u201cloining\u201d) plant in Majuro, which employs 300 people.\n\nEvery effort is being made to make the RMI a competitive and attractive place for foreign\n54.\ndirect investment, and for profitable expansion of existing enterprises. The Government\u2019s efforts\nto  improve  the  investment  climate  (assisted  by  ADB)  have  resulted  in  substantially  increased\nemployment in the fisheries sector, including the 300 new jobs in the fish processing (\u201cloining\u201d)\nplant.  These  efforts  can  lead  to  real  economic  growth  and  an  increase  in  new  jobs.  However,\nthe growth is unlikely to be sufficient to absorb the increasing number of job seekers. Under the\nCompact,  RMI  citizens  can  live  and  work  in  the  United  States,  and  some  will  do  so.  While\nstrategies  to  promote  private  sector-led  economic  growth,  strengthen  financial  management,\nand  improve  governance  are  put  in  place,  a  qualified  and  skilled  workforce  is  also  needed.\nEventually,  wages  in  the  RMI  which  are  much  higher  than  in  many  of  the  RMI\u2019s  natural\ncompetitors, will need to fall, and technical skill and output per person will need to rise if the RMI\nis  to  gain  any  comparative  advantage.  The  Project  addresses  only  one  aspect  of  the  overall\neconomic and financial challenge.\n\n55.\nBy  occupational  groups,  the  production  workers,  laborers,  and  transport  equipment\noperators  comprise  the  largest  percentage  of  the  RMI\u2019s  employed  population  (24.4  percent),\nfollowed by the agricultural workers and fishermen (20.5 percent). By gender, the largest group\nof employed males are in agriculture and related group (26.2 percent), followed by  the second\nlargest  group  of  employed  males  composed  of  production  workers,  transport  equipment\noperators, and construction workers (25.4 percent). By comparison, among female workers, the\nclerical workers is the largest group, comprising 26.5 percent of employed females, followed by\nthose engaged in production jobs constituting 18.9 percent.\n\n56.\nBy industry group, the largest percentage of both male and female workers belong to the\ngroup \u201ccommunity, social, and personal services,\u201d with males in this industry accounting for 35.6\npercent of all male workers, and the females, 41.8 percent of all female workers. This is to be\nexpected,  since \nincludes  service  workers,  government  officials,\nprofessionals,  and  technical  and  related  workers  such  as  medical  workers  and  teachers.  The\nnext  largest  industry  group  for  men  is  \u201celectricity,  gas,  and  water\u201d  (11.9  percent),  and  that  for\nwomen  is  \u201c\u2018manufacturing\u201d  (21.7  percent).  Most  women  under  the  \u201cmanufacturing\u201d  group  are\nengaged in handicrafts.\n\nindustry  group \n\nthis \n\n\f13\n\n15.\n\nKey Issues\n\na.\n\nIneffective  Vocational Education Programs\n\nVocational education programs particularly lack relevance to the work environment and\n57.\ndo not articulate with the nonformal skills training programs. Prevocational programs in grades 9\nand  10  are  not  well  organized  and  are  not  effective  in  introducing  students  to  the  work\nenvironment and to the vocational options open to them. Tools and teaching materials skills are\ntoo  scarce  to  enable  students  to  appreciate  simple  production  processes  or  grasp  vocational\ncareer concepts.\n\n58.\nHigh schools offer a large number of vocational electives in grades 11 and 12 but lack\nfacilities,  equipment,  operating  funds,  trained  teachers,  and  organized  and  efficient  programs.\nVocational  electives  are  developed  without  the  involvement  of  industry  and  the  private  sector\nand  without  training  need  assessments.  There  is  little  consultation  with  employers  to  assess\nskilled  needs  for  human  resources.  This  has  resulted  in  a  mismatch  between  vocational\neducation  and  the  job  market.  In  many  cases,  the  number  of  students  taking  electives  is  less\nthan  10;  too  few  for  the  programs  to  be  cost-effective.  In  addition,  because  equipment  and\nmaterials  are  scarce,  there  is  very  little  opportunity  for  practical  work.  At  the  same  time,\nvocational  education  in  schools  detracts  from  academic  competency  so  that  vocational\neducation  students\u2019  abilities  in  science,  mathematics,  and  English  remain  very  low.  These\ncompetencies  are  becoming  increasingly  crucial  prerequisites  for  the  preparation  of  skilled\nworkers. With advancing technology, workers are increasingly required to read and understand\nblueprints  and  instructions  critical  for  the  operation  of  complex  and  expensive  machines  and\ninstruments. Vocational education students are, therefore, not well prepared for the job market.\nThey are also too young to master vocational skills and at the end of their training do not have\nany employable skills and remain unemployed.\n\nb.\n\nIneffective Skills Training System\n\n59.\nA  major  issue  facing  the  skills  training  system  in  the  RMI  is  that  it  is  ineffective  and\ninefficient. The interface is poor among training agencies, training providers, training authorities,\nand  the  private  sector.  The  existing  consultative  mechanism  for  the  management  and\ncoordination  of  skills  training  is  ineffective.  The  National  Training  Council  (NTC),  established\nunder the Industries Development Act of 1991 to serve as the overall coordinating body for skills\ntraining  in  the  RMI  has  not  been  active  for  lack  of  funds.  Although  NTC  was  mandated  to\nestablish skills training standards, test trainees, and issue certificates to trained workers, it has\nyet to implement these effectively.\n\n60.\nBecause  training  is  not  coordinated,  programs  are  duplicated  and  roles  of  training\nagencies  overlap.  There  are  no  quality  control  measures  for  national  skill  standards,  testing\ndesign  and  procedure,  accreditation  of  training  programs,  or  certification  of  skills.  The\nduplication  and  lack  of  articulation  and  sequencing  of  training  programs  among  training\nagencies have reduced economies of scale and increased costs of training. There is an urgent\nneed for the roles and responsibilities of training agencies such as NTC, WIB, CMI, MOE, and\nother  training  stakeholders  to  be  delineated  unequivocally.  The  Government  and  ADB\ndiscussed  this  issue,  and  the  Government  was  asked  to  delineate  the  roles  and  reach  an\nunderstanding  among  stakeholders  prior  to  loan  negotiations.  The  Government  has  since\nprovided written delineation of roles and responsibilities signed by all four agencies.\n\n\f14\n\nSkills  training  programs,  carried  out  in  the  CMI  skills  training  centers  in  Ebeye  and\n61.\nMajuro,  are  relatively  better  designed  than  vocational  electives.  They  included  some  practical\nwork and on-the-job skills training. But because of limited and unsuitable training facilities and of\ninsufficient equipment, instructors, training materials, and other resources, training is inefficient\nboth  internally  and  externally.  Only  about  540  of  the  1,620  (or  30  percent)  people  trained\nbetween 1994 and 1999 were employed, but most of them had to be retrained. Only 10 returned\nto  school  under  the  adult  school  program.  The  unit  cost  of  training  is  also  very  high  at  about\n$4,000.\n\nc.\n\nLack of Skills Training Opportunities in the Outer Islands\n\n62.\nHardly  any  formal  or  nonformal  skills  training  is  available  in  the  outer  islands.  Skills\ntraining  programs  such  as  those  offered  in  Ebeye  and  Majuro  are  not  available  in  any  of  the\nouter  islands.  Consequently,  people  in  the  outer  islands  lack  education  and  training\nopportunities. Women and the youth are particularly vulnerable in the RMI, but more so in the\nouter  islands,  which  have  only  occasional  ad  hoc  training  organized  by  NGOs.  Furthermore,\nouter islands people can not commute to a central location for training because of distance and\nfamily responsibilities.\n\n63.\n The social impact assessment (Appendix 6) carried out by the Mission in five test sites\nin two urban centers and two outer islands revealed that the primary training needs of women in\nthe outer island are not being addressed. The needs are in areas such as improvement of food\nproduction,  health  and  nutrition,  and  income  generation.  A  community  outreach  program  is\nneeded  for  women,  especially  for  mothers  unable  to  attend  regular  training.  The  social\nassessment revealed that the development of a community outreach program and the inclusion\nof  housing  units  and  hostels  for  students  and  teachers  will  help  increase  enrollment  in  skills\ntraining  particularly  for  women.  The  assessment  also  showed  that  most  women  and  out-of-\nschool youths would enroll to learn skills and would even willingly pay for the training, if they (i)\nknow  about  the  program  and  its  objectives;  (ii)  believe  that  the  training  would  significantly\nincrease prospects for employment or to start a small business; (iii) are convinced the type of\ntraining is appropriate and would be of immediate use to them after training; and, (iv) are aware\nthat training will be available to those (e.g., mothers) who are unable to leave their families for\nextended periods and live in the training centers during training.\n\nParents  now  believe  that  education  and  skills  training  would  help  their  children  and\n64.\nthemselves to secure better employment. Thus, the attitude that there are no options for young\npeople after dropping out of school is changing. Church-based women and youth organizations,\nwhich  exist  in  most  communities  in  the  urban  centers  and  in  the  outer  islands,  provide\noccasional  skills  training  for  women  and  youth.  With  some  training  and  support,  these\norganizations can play an important role in popularizing the Project and the importance of skills\ntraining. 8\n\n65.\nThe assessment identified the need for a women\u2019s training, marketing, and information\ncenter  (WTMIC)  specifically  for  Majuro,  to  improve  and  market  women\u2019s  handicrafts.  Women\nparticularly  lack  access  to  information  on  health,  nutrition,  and  parenting.  Consequently,  they\nremain  ill-informed,  poorly  motivated,  and  lack  initiative  to  combat  health  and  nutrition\ndeficiency-related illnesses. Local resources remain unexploited while opportunities to improve\nincomes and standards of health and basic amenities of life are lost.\n\n                                                          \n8 Canada Fund estimated that there are around 600 such organizations in the RMI.\n\n\f15\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nincreasing \n\n66.\nThe  Government\u2019s  policies  on  skills  development  are  to  develop  a  national  training\nsystem  to  help  increase  the  self-reliance  of  the  Marshallese  people  and  lessen  their\ndependence on external assistance. This is to be achieved mainly through the development of a\nskills  training  system  that  will  maximize  the  efficient  use  and  management  of  the  country\u2019s\nresources  and \nfor  vulnerable  groups.  The\nincome-generating  opportunities \nGovernment\u2019s  skills  training  priorities  in  the  next  five  years  are  (i)  eliminating  duplication  of\ntraining effort and fostering collaboration among agencies and clients, (ii) developing an informal\ntraining  mechanism  to  reach  out  to  vulnerable  groups  in  the  outer  islands,  (iii)  increasing  the\nparticipation  of  the  private  sector  in  skills  training,  (iv)  providing  worker  preparation  and\nemployment  placement  processes,  (v) training  staff  on  a  continuing  basis,  (vi)  establishing  a\nlabor  market  system,  (vii)  educating  and  training  youth  and  women  in  particular  to  become\nproductive  citizens  and  leaders  of  the  RMI,  and  (viii)  changing  the  present  contract-driven\nworkforce system to a customer-driven system.\n\nThe Government\u2019s strategies for improving skills training are to (i) develop an integrated,\n67.\ncoordinated,  and  efficient  skill  training  system  that  meets  the  need  for  well-trained  skilled\nworkers  for  national  economic  and  social  development;  (ii)  reform  vocational  education\nprograms in high schools to remove duplication of programs and make students more aware of\ntraining options and be more trainable with a strong foundation in basic academic skills; and (iii)\nstrengthen skills training programs to make them relevant, cost effective, and efficient.\n\n68.\nTo address the weaknesses of vocational education and skills training in the country, the\nGovernment  recently  developed  a  national  skills  training  plan.  The  plan  calls  for  the\nrationalization  and  reorganization  of  skills  training  under  a  comprehensive  and  integrated\nnational  skills  training  system  with  clearly  defined  responsibilities  for  training  institutions,  the\nprivate  sector,  and  other  stakeholders.  Skills  training  will  be  coordinated  and  improved  on  a\nnational  basis  to  ensure  efficient  planning,  quality  training,  and  appropriate  delivery.  High\nschools  and  skills  training  centers  will  complement  each  other\u2019s  efforts  with  the  schools\neducating,  guiding,  and  preparing  students  for  eventual  training  in  the  skills  training  centers.\nHigh schools will cease to provide vocational education in grades 11 and 12. Instead they will\noffer,  from  grades  9  to  12,  career  awareness  programs  designed  to  introduce  students  to  the\nwork environment and to the vocational options open to them. The career awareness program\nwill  not  provide  any  skills  training  but  will  provide  career  information  and  counseling  to  help\nstudents  make  informed  career  choices  in  vocational  and  occupational  areas.  The  career\norientation  program  will  include  the  best  elements  from  the  current  prevocational  education\nprogram and the school-to-work program to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. With the\ndiscontinuance  of  vocational  education  in  grades  11  and  12,  high  schools  will  have  more\nresources,  time,  and  staff  to  devote  to  the  improvement  of  basic  academic  skills.  The\nanticipated enhancement of the proficiency of academic skills of students at all levels will make\nthem more trainable in skill areas and better qualified to enter postsecondary education without\nthe need for remedial education.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n69.\nExternal  assistance  to  education  has  been  mainly  in  the  form  of  US  federal  grants.  In\nrecent years, from a high of $4.5 million in 1988, the US education budget support fell to $1.9\nmillion  in  1992.  Since  then,  with  education  expenditure  rising,  the  Government  has  assumed\ngreater responsibility for education expenditure but its funding has not sufficed to compensate\n\n\f16\n\nfor the reduction in US grants. As a result, total funding for education has fallen. Assistance to\nthe  sector  from  other  external  agencies  has  been  small.  Assistance  to  the  technical  and\nvocation training sector has been provided mainly from the US budgetary support to education,\nmainly from the federal funds. The Japanese government funded the new building for the MIHS\nat Rita and the equipment for the vocation training programs.\n\n70.\nADB\u2019s first loan to the education sector, of $8.0 million for the ongoing Basic Education\nProject  (footnote  1),  is  to  raise  the  quality  and  relevancy  of  basic  education.  The  project  has\nbegun  to  address  the  weaknesses  in  elementary  education.  Under  this  project,  several  major\nstrides  were  made  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  and  to  lay  the  foundation  for  continued\nand sustained improvement. The Basic Education Project has provided the country with a well-\ndeveloped  and  sequenced  curriculum,  a  prerequisite  for  sound  education,  together  with  well\narticulated  teacher\u2019s  guide  books.  The  three-year  teacher  training  program  under  the  Basic\nEducation  Project,  which  replaced  the  two-year  program  in  CMI,  was  designed  to  improve\nknowledge and pedagogy. The project is helping to raise the quality of teacher training. CMI has\nalso been able to renew its accreditation status with the accreditation body in the US.\n\n71.\nAnother  milestone  is  the  certification  process  initiated  by  the  Teacher  Training\nCommittee  set  up  under  the  project  to  track  the  large  numbers  of  unqualified  teachers  and\nenforce  teacher  certification  requirements  as  stipulated  in  the  Education  Act  (1992).  The\nnational  student  evaluation  tests,  which  were  developed  and  field-tested  under  the  Basic\nEducation Project for grades 4, 6, and 8 will be implemented this year. This will further help to\nraise  educational  standards  nationwide.  The  staff  development  program  has  succeeded  in\ntraining  teachers  and  administrators  in  pedagogic  and  managerial  skills.  With  curriculum\nreforms, improvements in student evaluation and teacher training, and improved competencies\nof staff well under way, the impact of the Basic Education Project is likely to be felt in the coming\nyears. MOE has also enlisted the assistance of the Pacific Region Education Laboratory and the\nUniversity  of  Hawaii  for  the  continued  monitoring  and  revision  of  the  curriculum  to  sustain  its\nrelevance.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nOnly one loan, the Basic Education Project, has been provided to the education sector.\n72.\nA valuable lesson learned is the importance of decentralization in a country where islands have\nvast reaches of ocean separating them. Under the proposed Project, components and training\nactivities are spread over four strategic islands with staff to manage and oversee the activities.\nAnother  lesson  learned  is  that  there  is  a  dearth  of  qualified  counterpart  staff  in  the  RMI  and\ninternational  consultants  are  needed  in  several  areas.  Under  the  proposed  Project,  an\ninternational  consultant  with  experience  in  project  management  will  be  engaged  to  be  the\nproject  manager.  A  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  work  as  a  project  accountant.  Consultants\nneed  to  be  carefully  selected  as  some  do  not  want  to  work  for  extended  periods  in  the  outer\nislands  or  have  the  understanding  and  flexibility  to  modify  strategies  to  suit  local  needs.  The\nBasic  Education  Project  also  showed  that  the  implementation  of  civil  works  requires  a  strong\nand  experienced  resident  engineer  familiar  with  local  contract  practices,  and  that  delays  are\noften  caused  by  infrequent  shipping  schedules  and  inexperienced  contractors.  Under  the\nproposed  Project,  an  experienced  engineer  familiar  with  local  conditions  and  customs  will  be\nengaged to ensure that the Project is implemented speedily. Frequent changes in administrators\nand  other  staff  of  MOE  also  cause  changes  in  priorities  and  delays  in  obtaining  Government\nthe  project\nimplementation  of  project  components.  Close  monitoring  by \napproval \nimplementation unit (PIU) and ADB is therefore important.\n\nfor \n\n\f17\n\nAnother  useful  lesson  learned  from  the  Basic  Education  Project  is  the  paucity  of  data\n73.\nand the difficulty in obtaining it, for planning, monitoring, and evaluating primary education and\n(especially)  school  dropouts,  participation  rates,  proficiency  levels,  and  teacher  distribution.\nUnder  the  proposed  Project,  a  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  a  labor  market\ninformation system will be set up to collect data for better planning, monitoring, and evaluation\nof  skill  training.  Government  counterpart  funding  has  also  been  slow  in  forthcoming.\nAccordingly,  the  size  and  the  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  has  been  adjusted  to  fit\nthe  Government\u2019s  budgetary  and  personnel  constraints;  specific  assurances  have  been\nobtained to ensure the timely release of counterpart funds.\n\n74.\nThe  change  in  curriculum,  improved  articulation,  standardized  testing,  improved  books\nand  teaching  aids,  and  teacher  training,  introduced  under  the  Basic  Education  Project,  are\nimproving  the  quality  of  education  in  the  elementary  level.  As  a  result  of  teacher  training,  the\nquality of elementary school education delivery has improved. Although the impact on student\nperformance and dropout rate will take more time to confirm, the number of elementary school\ngraduates  eligible  for  and  seeking  high  school  admission  has  increased  in  the  last  two  years.\nThe actual enrollment has remained static due to lack of available seats in high school. These\ndevelopments have been factored into the design of the Project.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n75.\nThe main focus of ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the RMI is to help the country achieve\ngreater economic self-reliance. ADB considers that the key measure to carry out this strategy is\nthe  development  of  human  resources  to  support  the  development  of  the  private  sector  and\nreduce  the  RMI\u2019s  dependence  on  foreign  labor  to  fill  professional,  managerial,  and  skilled\nworker  positions.  Fundamental  to  the  training  of  sound  personnel  in  these  areas  is  the\navailability of trainable personnel with a good basic education and a sound skills training system\nto support human resources needs. The low level of educational attainment of the labor force is\na major impediment to the development of skilled human resources. The ongoing ADB-assisted\nBasic Education Project is addressing several weaknesses in the provision of basic education\nand is expected to provide a strong foundation for the training of professional, managerial, and\nhigher skills positions.\n\n76.\nAdditionally, ADB\u2019s operational strategy will focus on poverty reduction by increasing the\nincome  generating  capability  of  Marshallese  women  with  a  view  to  having  more  than  one\nincome  earner  per  household.  Appropriate  dispersal  of  skills  training  facilities  across  the\narchipelago will increase access to educational benefits in the outer islands.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nDuring a policy dialogue among the Government, skills training and vocational education\n77.\nagencies,  and  ADB,  several  matters  of  concern  were  discussed,  including  the  overlap  of\nresponsibilities and functions of training agencies. The agencies agreed to cooperate with one\nanother  to  ensure  the  speedy  and  successful  implementation  of  the  Project.  Under  the\nchairmanship  of  the  Minister  of  Education,  the  meeting  clearly  delineated  the  major  role  and\nresponsibilities  of  skills  training  and  related  agencies  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  It  was\nagreed that the role of MOE would be overall coordination, planning, and delivery of the RMI\u2019s\neducation  strategy;  implementation  of  the  strategy  for  vocational  education  and  skills  training;\nprevocation  education  planning  and  delivery;  and  market-based  curriculum  development.  The\nGovernment has subsequently confirmed that the Industries Development Act 1991 will need to\n\n\f18\n\nbe amended to allow the MOE to have overall responsibility for planning and coordinating skills\ntraining and vocational education in RMI. Necessary action to amend the law is being taken.\n\n78. WIB  will  be  responsible  for  sourcing  funds  from  US  grants  for  training  services,\ncontracting  service  providers,  paying  service  providers,  establishing  criteria  for  award  of\ncontracts,  and  managing  one-stop  centers.  Training  service  providers  will  be  responsible  for\nproviding training, feedback, and reports to MOE, WIB, STW, NTC, and other related agencies.\nNTC\u2019s  role  will  be  to  establish  standards  and  prepare  the  tests  at  various  levels  of  training;\nconduct  skills  testing  and  issue  certificates  of  skills  proficiency;  carry  out  research,  market\nstudies,  and  assessment  of  skills  and  vocational  needs;  assess  performance  of  service\nproviders;  and  collect,  collate  all  reports  from  training  agencies  for  submission  to  MOE.  MOE\nagreed to obtain a written commitment from NTC, WIB, CMI, and MOE on their respective roles\nunder the Project.\n\n79.\nThe  reform  of  the  inefficient  vocational  education  programs  in  high  schools,  with  the\nduplication of vocational education by STW programs and a large number of courses with few\nparticipants  has  also  been  the  subject  of  discussion.  The  Government  has  developed  a\ncomprehensive  policy  on  vocational  education  and  skills  training  to  address  this  issue.  As  a\nresult,  high  school  vocational  education  program  is  being  replaced  with  a  career  awareness\nprogram. The issue of strengthening the understaffed Directorate of Vocational Education (DVE)\nin  MOE  to  assume  the  added  responsibilities  envisaged  was  also  taken  up  with  the\nGovernment,  and  MOE  agreed  to  increase  DVE\u2019s  staff.  The  question  of  sustainability  of  the\nProject  and  the  provision  of  counterpart  funds  was  also  discussed  and  the  Government  has\nassured ADB that it will provide the required recurrent expenditure funding, beginning in FY2002\nand  continuing  in  subsequent  years,  with  additional  amounts  clearly  appropriated  to  the\neducation budget for vocational education and skills training.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n80.\nThe Government\u2019s efforts to improve the socioeconomic conditions and living standards\nof  the  people  through  economic  reforms  and  measures  are  constrained  by  the  lack  of  skilled\nhuman  resources.  Efforts  to  increase  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities,\nespecially  for  women  and  the  youth,  are  hampered  by  the  lack  of  training  and  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  especially  in  the  outer  islands.  The  large  number  of  school  dropouts\nwho  lack  employment  skills  flood  the  unemployment  market  each  year,  with  attendant  social\nproblems.  The  Government  plans  to  provide  equitable  training  opportunities  to  this  unskilled\ngroup so that its members can contribute to the RMI\u2019s economic and social development.\n\nTo do this, the education and vocational training must be made relevant and efficient by\n81.\nupgrading  facilities  and  equipment,  making  the  curriculum  and  programs  appropriate  to  the\npotential employers needs, and training teachers. Students must be provided the basic literacy\nand  numeracy  skills  they  need  to  master  the  complex  and  sophisticated  skills  of  modern-day\ntrade and technical occupations and to gain admission to the postsecondary level.\n\n82.\nThe  Government,  to  address  the  problems  facing  vocational  education  and  skills\ntraining, has developed a new vocational education and education and skills training policy and\nplan.  Under  this  plan,  skills  training  will  be  reorganized  into  a  comprehensive  and  integrated\nnational certification system. To control the quality of training, skills standards and tests will be\ndeveloped  and  certification  introduced.  The  system  will  facilitate  the  vertical  and  horizontal\n\n\f19\n\nmobility of dropouts and skilled workers who will be able to improve their education and return to\nthe  mainstream  of  education  or  advance  to  higher  skill  training  levels.  The  objectives  and\nresponsibilities  of  training  agencies,  the  private  sector,  and  other  stakeholders  will  be  clearly\ndefined  to  avoid  overlap  and  duplication  of  effort  and  ensure  greater  collaboration  among\ntraining  agencies.  High  schools  will  provide  career  orientation  and  leave  the  primary\nresponsibility  for  providing  skills  training  and  the  promotion  of  employment  opportunities  for\nwomen and out-of-school youth to the nonformal education subsector.\n\nThe  Project  is  designed  to  accommodate  the  recommendations  of  the  ADB-funded\n83. \nstudy, Strategic Plan for the Ministry of Education9, and the Government\u2019s vocational education\nand  skills  training  policy  and  plan.  Attention  was  also  given  to  the  changes  introduced  by  the\nnew Government policy on vocational education and skills training: limiting the vocational role of\nthe  high  schools  to  career  orientation  education,  concentrating  skills  training  in  nonformal\ntraining institutions, and expanding skills training opportunities to women and youth. The original\nproject objective and scope were modified accordingly.\n\nThe  Project  aims  to  help  the  Government  implement  the  national  skills  training  system\n84.\nwithin the context of its national economic development plan, education strategic plan, and the\nvocational education and skills training plan. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s operational\nstrategy  to  help  the  RMI  achieve  greater  economic  self-reliance  through  the  development  of\ntrainable  personnel  with  a  strong  foundation  in  basic  education  and  sound  skills.  Additionally,\nthe  Project  follows  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  on  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  the  income\ngenerating  capability  of  Marshallese  women.  Appropriate  dispersal  of  skills  training  facilities\nacross the archipelago will provide increased coverage and access to educational benefits for\nvulnerable  groups  in  the  outer  islands.  The  Project  also  takes  into  account  the  findings  of  an\nADB social assessment study (para. 131) and provides for increasing training opportunities for\nwomen and the youth.\n\nAttention has been given to cost savings in the design of the Project by taking advantage\n85.\nof existing facilities and personnel as much as possible. As NTC has moved into a new rented\nlocation, no civil works are provided. Similarly, emphasis is on upgrading existing facilities in the\nskills training centers in Ebeye and Majuro and new civil works are kept to the minimum. Some\nof  the  equipment  from  the  discontinued  vocational  education  programs  will  be  used  for  the\ncareer orientation program and others will be sent to the skills training centers. Excess teachers\nfrom  vocational  education  programs  will  be  retrained  if  qualified  to  teach  career  orientation\nprograms in high schools or the approved position reassigned to skills centers for recruitment.\nCMI  staff  appointed  under  a  US-funded  extension  program  will  be  trained  and  seconded  as\nmanagers  to  the  training  centers  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje.  Hostels  and  staff  housing  in  Jaluit  and\nWotje will be used for training women and the youth from other outer islands and for high school\nstudents  from  remote  outer  islands.  Sufficient  attention  has  also  been  given  to  the  training\nneeds  of  vulnerable  people  especially  women.  Training  centers  for  women  and  the  youth  are\nbeing  provided  in  four  islands,  and  a  women\u2019s  training,  and  marketing  and  information  center\n(WTMIC) in Majuro.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n86.\nThe overall objective of the Project is to help the Government implement an integrated\nand articulated national skills training system. Specific objectives are to strengthen the quality of\nthe  career  orientation  program  to  guide  high  school  students  appropriately  in  their  career  and\n\n                                                          \n9 TA 2599-RMI: Civil Service Reform Implementation, for $100,000, approved on 2 July 1996.\n\n\f20\n\nskills  training  options;  improve  the  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training;  and  increase  short-\nterm  employment  and  self-employment  oriented  skills  training  for  the  unemployed  and\nunderemployed in the outer islands, with a special emphasis on women and the youth. Details\nof the Project\u2019s goals and objectives and related inputs and outputs are provided in the Logical\nFramework (Appendix 7).\n\n87.\nThe Project comprises four components: (i) developing a career awareness program; (ii)\nimproving  skills  training;  (iii)  enhancing  skills  training  opportunities  for  women  and  youth;  and\n(iv) institutional strengthening.\n\n1. \n\nPart A: Developing a Career Awareness Program\n\nThe  component  aims  at  developing  a  career  orientation  program  in  high  schools  to\n88.\nreplace  the  current  vocational  education  program  and  includes  career  orientation  and\ncounseling programs and training and counseling support.\n\nCareer  Orientation  Program.  Consultants  will  develop  a  new  program  to  provide\n89.\nstudents  an  understanding  of  the  wide  range  of  occupational  skills  and  other  career\nopportunities.  The  program  will  reflect  the  needs  of  the  private  sector  and  the  community  and\nwill  articulate  with  programs  available  in  the  skills  training  centers.  It  will  provide  career\nawareness  among  students,  introduce  them  to  the  work  environment  and  to  careers  and\nvocational  options  specifically  open  to  them,  and  help  them,  make  informed  career  choices  in\nvocational and occupational areas.\n\nCounseling  Programs.  Career  orientation  will  be  complemented  with  counseling\n90.\nprograms  to  provide  adequate  and  up-to-date  information  on  job  and  training  opportunities  to\nstudents.  Students  will  also  be  introduced  to  simple  skills,  tools,  and  production  processes  to\nenable them to grasp vocational concepts, especially in relation to local knowledge, skills, and\ncustoms.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  visits  to  industry,  farms,  and  business  enterprises  and\ntalks  by  representatives  of  industry  and  business  concerns.  This  will  give  them  an  idea  of  the\ntype of skills training options open to them when they leave school and whether they have an\naptitude  for  such  training.  Career  orientation  programs  will  be  closely  aligned  to  the  training\noptions  available  in  the  skills  training  centers  e.g.,  agriculture,  food  preservation,  cooking,\nsewing, gardening, fishing, construction, repair of small engines, commerce.\n\n91.\nTraining  and  Counseling  Support.  A  training  room  for  conducting  career  orientation\nprograms  and  a  counseling  room  will  be  constructed  in  each  of  the  three  public  high  schools.\nTraining kits in a number of training areas, teaching materials, equipment, reference materials,\nand guidebooks for teachers will also be provided. Teachers of career orientation programs will\nbe  given \ntechnical  and  pedagogic\ncompetencies.\n\nin-country  and  regional \n\nto  upgrade \n\ntraining \n\ntheir \n\n2. \n\nPart B:  Improving Skills Training\n\nThe  component  aims  at  developing  an  integrated  skills  training  system  and  includes\n\n92. \none-stop centers, skills training programs, curriculum development, and skills training centers.\n\n93.\nOne-Stop Centers. The Project will support WIB to construct one-stop centers in Majuro\nand  Ebeye  and  subcenters  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje.  Equipment  and  furniture  will  be  provided  to\nenable these centers to act as clearing and training referral centers and offer services such as\n(i)  direct  job  referral  to  qualified  applicants;  and  (ii)  referral  to  training,  counseling,  academic\n\n\f21\n\nimprovement,  or  other  employment  readiness  programs.  The  centers  will  maintain  a  job  data\nbank of available employment opportunities including eligibility requirements, and develop a list\nof service providers whose offerings include vocational training, job-specific training, academic\nor technical training, and job readiness training.\n\n94.\nSkills Training Programs. The Project will support and upgrade skills training programs\nbeing  run  by  CMI  in  Ebeye  and  Majuro  under  WIB  and  funded  by  the  US  government.\nGenerally, three types of skills training courses will be provided in the centers: basic academic\neducation  and  elementary  skills  for  school  dropouts  aged  14-16  years;  skills  and  education\nenrichment development courses for school dropouts aged 16-18 years, to help them to reenter\nhigh  school;  and  technical  courses  for  high  school  graduates.  Certificates  will  be  given  at  the\nend  of  each  level:  the  Certificate  of  Basic  Proficiency,  Certificate  of  Intermediate  Proficiency,\nand  the  Certificate  of  Advanced  Proficiency.  Students  will  be  able  to  upgrade  their  education\nand training skills at each level and will earn credits for upward or horizontal movement.\n\n95.\nStudents who dropped out of high school at the eighth grade will have a second chance\nto  reenter  the  tenth  grade  by  upgrading  their  academic  proficiency.  The  three  levels  of\ncertification  will  be  validated  nationally  and  recognized  by  industry.  The  skills  centers  will  also\nrun courses for retraining or upgrading skills of employees whose skills are insufficient for or not\nrelevant to the needs of industry. Special ad hoc courses will also be run in interested firms to\nencourage them to participate in the new skills training program. Better trained, more productive\nemployees  will  be  the  incentive  for  firms.  Existing  courses  will  be  reviewed  and  strengthened\nand new ones introduced to meet market demand. Training in the centers will be accompanied\nby  on-the-job  training  in  an  industrial  or  commercial  establishment  through  a  collaborative\narrangement beneficial to the firm and the trainee. It will provide firms the opportunity to observe\npotential future employees. Courses will be 3-12 months depending on the type of course and\nthe entrants\u2019 qualifications and training. The centers will also conduct training programs that are\nspecially  tailored  to  the  needs  of  industry  and  the  outer  islands  and  that  are  not  available  in\nJaluit and Wotje.\n\n96.\nCurricula Development. Curricula for skills training courses will be developed with the\nhelp  of consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  Project.  The  curricula  will  be  competency-based\nand  will  enable  students  to  move  at  their  own  pace  and  to  achieve  certification  at  varying\nspeeds. The Project will also help establish skill standards and training modules for the major\noccupations and develop modularized training packages, based on relevant industry needs and\nthe need to increase the employability and mobility of Marshallese in the region and especially\nthe  US,  to  which  Marshallese  have  free  access.  To  widen  the  scope  of  employability  and\nmobility  in  the  region  and  the  US,  training  curriculum  and  standards  will  conform  to  the  US\nDepartment  of  Labor  requirements.  To  maintain  uniformity  in  the  quality  of  training,  the\naccreditation  of  training  programs  in  neighboring  countries  and  in  the  US  will  be  maintained\nthrough a review and adoption of a recognized training program of the US.\n\n97.\nSkills  Training  Centers. As  the  main  skills  training  providers  in  the  RMI,  the  two  CMI\nskills training centers in Majuro and Ebeye will be rehabilitated and upgraded to provide quality\ntraining  for  youth,  adults,  school  dropouts,  and  others.  The  Project  will  provide  these  centers\nwith classrooms, workshops, furniture, and equipment. In addition, consultants will be provided\nto  develop  curricula  and  training  materials  for  new  courses.  Instructors  of  these  centers  will\nreceive overseas and in-country training.\n\n98.\nYouth  who  have  dropped  out  of  schools  and  those  who  are  unemployed  will  have\naccess  to  training  and  education  in  the  centers  which  will  provide  them  with  opportunities  to\n\n\f22\n\nreturn to school, improve their employability, and generate income. Course offerings will focus\non  their  special  needs  in  education  and  training.  Young  people  interested  in  skills  training  not\navailable  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje  will  be  sent  to  Ebeye  or  Majuro.  A  consultant  will  be  engaged  to\ndevelop courses and strategies to encourage dropouts to return to school or acquire employable\nor self-employable skills, and to build the self-esteem and national pride in young people.\n\n3. \n\nPart C: Special Training Programs for Women and the Youth\n\nThis  component  aims  to  improve  income-generating  opportunities  of  women  and  the\n99.\nyouth,  especially  in  the  outer  islands  and  includes  community  outreach  programs;  training  for\nwomen and the youth; and a WTMIC.\n\n100. Community  Outreach  Programs.  Based  on  the  missions\u2019  investigation,  community\noutreach will be undertaken for women and dropouts in isolated and inaccessible outer islands\nto  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impact.  Development  of  gender-oriented  courses\nwill encourage female enrollment (para. 144) and training on sex education, reproductive health,\nand  contraception  will  help  limit  teenage  pregnancies,  improve  women\u2019s  economic  prospects,\nand limit family size. Access to quality training and improved facilities will provide better career\nand  entrepreneurial  development  opportunities  for  women,  particularly  for  young  mothers.\nMoreover,  skills  training  will  benefit  women  and  their  families,  as  the  women  will  be  able  to\nincrease food production and improve nutrition in their homes. Women\u2019s participation, through\nthe  numerous  groups  actively  working  in  the  communities,  will  be  encouraged  through  the\nprovision of training and resources to effect meaningful changes to their lives and those of their\nfamily members to benefit women in the outer islands, and special courses  will be organized,\nmainly  in  agriculture  (farming,  poultry  rearing,  and  pig  rearing);  fisheries  (aquaculture);  family-\nrelated skills (childcare, sewing, cooking, gardening, nutrition, traditional medicine, reproductive\nhealth,  management  of  households,  and  small  business \nincome  generation\n(handicraft,  small  business  management,  and  marketing);  traditional  skills  (canoe  building);\nvalues formation (parenting and teaching skills, and gender training); and leadership training.\n\nfinance); \n\n101. Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  the  encouragement  and  promotion  of  handicraft\nactivities,  and  development  of  entrepreneurial,  marketing,  management,  and  small  business\nskills  for  self-employment.  Small  business  development  will  be  incorporated  to  increase  self-\nemployment  prospects.  Skills  training  courses  proven  successful  when  the  Women\u2019s  Division\nwas  active  (e.g.,  sewing  machine  repair  skills,  dressmaking,  and  tailoring),  will  be  conducted.\nBasic tools and materials (e.g., sewing kits and machines) will be provided to participants after\ntraining  to  ensure  that  skills  learned  are  available  for  personal  or  commercial  use.  Island  fairs\nand  exhibitions  will  be  organized  to  disseminate  and  collect  information  from  communities  on\nisland  business  or  cottage  industry  opportunities  that  could  be  developed.  Workshops  will  be\nheld  on  managing  handicraft  courses,  tapping  overseas  markets  for  local  products,  and\npreparing catalogues for distribution to potential buyers. A consultant will be engaged to develop\na strategic plan and programs for the training of women.\n\n102.\nImplementation  of  the  community  outreach  programs  will  begin  with  a  pilot  program  of\nselected islands. Following an evaluation of the pilot program, the implementation strategy will\nbe reviewed and revised if necessary. Jaluit and Wotje islands will be used as the pilot areas for\nthe  first  year  of  the  Project  before  moving  into  more  remote  islands.  Itinerant  trainers  and\ncommunity members will conduct needs assessments and training activities in selected areas.\nTrainers  familiar  with  local  customs  and  situations  will  be  engaged  to  encourage  participation\namong  women  and  the  youth.  The  selection  of  other  pilot  areas  will  be  based  on  the  level  of\ncommunity organization, interest, and preparedness. This participatory approach is designed to\n\n\f23\n\nmaximize  project  impact  and  sustainability.  Project  implementation  progress  will  be  monitored\nby quarterly and annual assessments from feedback from high schools, skills training centers,\nand the special centers for women and the youth in Wotje and Jaluit. Teachers, instructors, and\ncommunity members in Ebeye, Jaluit, Majuro, and Wotje will be engaged to reach out to outer\nand  remote  islands  where  they  will  conduct  the  community  outreach  programs,  short  training\ncourses, and demonstrations for women and the youth in these and neighboring islands.\n\n103.\nTraining Units for Women and the Youth. The Project will support the construction of\nspecial  training  units  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje  to  conduct  training,  demonstrations,  discussions,  and\nseminars to develop self-employment and small-scale business opportunities in each one-stop\ncenter and subcenter to provide training and organize related programs. In addition, a hostel for\nmale  students  and  another  for  female  students  together  with  staff  housing  units  will  be\nconstructed in Jaluit and Wotje to house and train women and youth and instructors from other\nislands.  A  proactive  public  information  campaign  via  the  radio,  found  to  be  the  most  effective\nway of disseminating information in outer islands and urban centers, will be mounted to create\nawareness  of  course  offerings,  roles  of  one-stop  subcenters  and  training  centers,  and\navailability  of  community  outreach  programs.  Equipment  such  as  sewing  machines,\nrefrigerators,  ovens,  visual  aids,  cameras,  video  recorders,  computers,  and  radios  will  be\nprovided to support training programs. About 400 women and youths will be trained yearly in the\nfour training units.\n\n104.\nThe training units will be run by CMI, which will appoint extension teachers as managers\nof  these  training  units  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje.  The  manager  will  (i)  be  responsible  for  assessing\ntraining requirements; organizing training; and selecting instructors, trainers, and demonstrators\nfrom the community, CMI, and other relevant institutions; (ii) develop a strategic plan for training\nwomen and the youth; (iii) manage, monitor, and evaluate the programs; and (iv) organize the\noutreach program with the extension teacher. Training will be provided following an assessment\nof  employment  and  self-employment  opportunities  in  the  outer  islands  and  will  be  aligned  to\nlocal, traditional, and rural resources. Consultant services will be provided to help the manager\ndevelop the strategic training plan and programs.\n\n105. Women\u2019s  Training,  Marketing,  and  Information  Center.  In  Majuro,  WTMIC  will  be\nconstructed  to  help  NGOs  (including  church  organizations)  provide  training  to  women  and\nexhibit their handicrafts for sale. The WTMIC will provide a permanent site for training and for\ndisplay and sale of articles produced by women. This will also provide opportunities for women\nto learn small business skills and eliminate the services of middlemen in marketing their wares.\nThe  WTMIC  will  be  a  meeting  place  where  women  can  interact,  share  experiences,  and  work\ntogether to resolve common problems. The WTMIC will also provide information exchange and\ncoordination  with  regional  information  centers.  The  WTMIC  will  be  managed  by  the  Women\u2019s\nDivision in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n4.\n\nPart D: Institutional Capacity Building:\n\n106.\nThis  component  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  regulate,  and  manage  an\nefficient  skills  training  system,  and  includes  monitoring  systems,  staff  development,  and\nresearch and studies.\n\n107. Monitoring  Systems.  To  strengthen \nthe  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation\ncapabilities  of  training  agencies,  appropriate  mechanisms  will  be  set  up  and  existing  ones\nstrengthened. A computer-based monitoring and information system will be set up and a benefit\nmonitoring system will be developed and institutionalized and performance indicators specified.\n\n\f24\n\nAppropriate  software  will  be  developed,  tested,  and  installed  by  a  consultant  who  will  also\nprepare manuals on MIS and conduct training programs. A labor market research system will be\nestablished  for  research  and  studies  on  selected  issue-oriented  topics  such  as  tracer  studies,\nlabor  market  trends,  employment  and  self-employment  opportunities  in  the  outer  islands,  and\nhuman resources needs. Information and data gathered will be used to determine programs and\ntraining  to  be  provided.  NTC  will  also  collect  data  for  analysis,  processing,  and  preparation  of\nreports for the Government and ADB.\n\n108. Staff  Development.  The  Project  will  support  the  training,  upgrading,  and  retraining  of\nskills  training  and  vocational  training  planners  and  administrators  and  others  from  training\nagencies,  CMI,  MOE,  NTC,  and  WIB.  The  staff  skills  will  be  upgraded  through  local,  regional,\nand international training in managerial, entrepreneurial, technical, and other skills.\n\n109. Research  and  Studies.  Research  and  studies  will  include  (i)  a  tracer  study  of\ngraduates of training agencies, (ii) outer island skills training needs, (iii) student aptitudes and\nmotivation, (iv) employment and self-employment generation, and (v) traditional and rural skills.\nThe  Project  will  also  initiate  public  awareness  campaigns  to  promote  skills  training  and  to\nmarket the trainees to the employers.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n110.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  taxes  and  duties  and  interest  during  the  project\nlife, is estimated at $9.1 million equivalent, including $6.7 million in foreign exchange and $2.4\nmillion  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1.\nDetailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 8.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($million)\n\nForeign Cost\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nProject Activity\nA.\n\nBase Costs\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n\nCivil Works\nFurniture and Equipment\nConsultant Services\nStaff Development\nResearch and Support Activities\nProject Implementation\nSubtotal\n\nB.\n\nContingencies\n1. \n2. \n\nPhysical Contingency (5%)a\nPrice Contingency (7.5%)b\nSubtotal\n\nTotal (A+B)\n\nC.\n\nInterest Charges\n\nTotal Project Cost\n\n2.050\n1.528\n1.524\n0.508\n0.240\n0.095\n5.945\n\n0.150\n0.400\n0.550\n6.495\n\n0.205\n\n6.700\n\n0.650\n0.162\n0.464\n0.200\n0.360\n0.262\n2.098\n\n0.084\n0.218\n0.302\n2.400\n\n0.000\n\n2.400\n\n2.700\n1.690\n1.988\n0.708\n0.600\n0.357\n8.043\n\n0.234\n0.618\n0.852\n8.895\n\n0.205\n\n9.100\n\na 5 percent physical contingency on civil works and furniture and equipment only.\nb 7.5 percent price contingency based on weighted average of 2.5 percent per annum for three years.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n\f25\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($million)\n\nForeign\nCurrency\n6.700\n0.000\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.125\n2.275\n\nTotal\n\n6.700\n\n2.400\n\nTotal\n6.825\n2.275\n\n9.100\n\nFinancing\nPercentage\n75.0\n25.0\n\n100.0\n\nThe Government requested ADB for a $6.825 million loan, corresponding to 75 percent\n111.\nof the project cost, from ADB's Special Funds resources to finance the entire foreign exchange\ncost of $6.700 million and $0.125 million of the local costs. The Government will provide $2.275\nmillion  as  counterpart  funding  to  finance  the  major  portion  of  the  local  cost  of  $2.400 million\nequivalent.  Table  2  summarizes  the  financing  plan.  This  Government\u2019s  share  will  be  spread\nover  the  four-year  implementation  period  of  the  loan  and  has  been  so  designed  to  provide  a\nlower rate of disbursement during the first two years in view of the Government's current funding\nconstraints. Due to changes in project design requested by the Government, the total cost of the\nProject  is  higher  than  estimated  at  the  time  of  the  fact-finding  mission.  The  revised  project\ndesign significantly supports the development objective of poverty alleviation among the poorest\npeople in the outer islands. Further, as an outcome of the social assessment, specific outreach\nprograms, and the WTMIC have been added.\n\n112.\nThe RMI has been having an economic downturn for the past four years. The downturn\nis  partly  induced  by  the  reform  program  initiated  in  1995  under  ADB\u2019s  Public  Sector  Reform\nProgram  loan.  Contraction  in  the  RMI\u2019s  public  sector  dominated  economy  was  anticipated  as\nresult of drastic reforms, which include a significant reduction in Government expenditures and\ndownsizing  of  civil  service.  Consequently,  the  Government  will  continue  to  face  serious  fiscal\nproblems until the economy is able to consolidate the gains from the reform measures currently\nin  place.  The  FY2001  budget  bill  presented  to  the  Parliament  for  approval  shows  a  deficit  of\n$4.2 million. This is primarily due to a shortfall in tax revenues, which is due to the lowering of\nthe tax rate and is aggravated by the substantial past due obligation in the health sector that has\nremained  unpaid  since  the  previous  Government.  The  recent  fuel  price  increase  is  also\nexpected  to  adversely  affect  the  FY2001  budget  deficit  through  increased  subsidies  for  outer\nisland  utilities  and  other  expenditures  driven  by  fuel  prices.  The  fiscal  situation  is  expected  to\nimprove  once  the  Government\u2019s  debt  obligation  is  settled  in  FY2002.  Due  to  these  special\ncircumstances the cost sharing has been modified to 75:25. The modification is in accordance\nwith the provision for flexibility in the ceiling for ADB financing, under ADB\u2019s graduation policy.10\nThe World Bank usually finances up to 80 percent of similar projects in the Pacific region.\n\n113.\nThe proposed ADB loan will have a payment period of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, with a 1.0 percent interest charge during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n\n114.\nIncremental  recurrent  costs  as  a  result  of  the  Project  will  not  be  significant  as  the\nadditional  teachers  and  staff  needed  by  institutions  will  come  from  the  staff  currently  teaching\nvocational education programs in high schools. Additional staff will be funded from US federal\nland grants, extension teachers at CMI, and reassignment of approved but unfilled teaching and\n\n                                                          \n10 R204-98: Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November.\n\n\f26\n\nadministrative posts in schools. NTC has moved to new spacious offices sufficient to carry out\nits  many  responsibilities  using  its  own  operating  funds.  Accordingly,  the  yearly  incremental\nrecurrent  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $205,000  starting  from  FY2002  (Table  3).  The  Government\nconfirmed  that  this  level  of  increase  can  be  supported  from  FY2002  and  will  be  specifically\nprovided for in the annual budget.\n\nTable 3: Recurrent Cost\n($)\n\nItem\n\nAdministrators, Teachers, and Instructors\nCommunications\nRental of Premises\nPublic Utilities\nMaintenance of Facilities\nTravel in the RMI\nConsumables\n\nTotal\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nCost\n\n58,000\n15,000\n25,000\n20,000\n22,000\n30,000\n35,000\n205,000\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nE.\n \nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be MOE, which will also be the Implementing\n115.\nAgency for all project activities. The Minister of Education or his representative will have overall\nresponsibility  for  planning,  organizing,  and  implementing  of  the  Project  and  will  liaise  closely\nwith all other Government departments and the private sector. MOE will be responsible for the\noverall  coordination  and  implementation  of  the  Project  and  in  accordance  with  established\nGovernment procedures, will be the official contact point for ADB. A project steering committee\n(PSC)  will  be  established  to  provide  policy  guidance  on  project  issues;  be  responsible  for  the\noverall \nthe  Project;  and  oversee  project  planning,  organization,\nimplementation, and monitoring. The PSC, which will meet at least once every quarter, will be\nchaired by the Minister of Education and members will include senior representatives of MOE,\nNTC, WIB, CMI, Directorate of Vocational Education of MOE, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of\nthe  Internal  Affairs,  Chamber  of  Commerce,  and  the  private  sector.  A  representative  from  the\nWomen\u2019s Division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be a PSC member and the focal point for\nsupport and assistance to women. The PSC will be assisted by the PIU manager.\n\nimplementation  of \n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Implementation Unit\n\n116.\nThe PIU, to be located in MOE, will be responsible for the day-to-day administration and\nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  liaison  with  ADB.  The  PIU  will  procure  goods  and  services\nneeded  for  the  implementation  of  all  the  components,  subcomponents,  and  activities  of  the\nProject.  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  project  manager  who  will  report  to  the  Secretary  of\nEducation.  The  project  manager  will  be  appointed  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  PIU  will  be\nstaffed  by  a  full-time  accountant  and  a  secretary  and  supported  by  an  engineer  to  provide\nengineering services as and when required. The PIU will meet the members of NTC, WIB, and\nservice  providers  from  time  to  time  to  resolve  any  project  implementation  issues  and  other\n\n\f27\n\nrelated matters. Local counterpart staff will support the project implementation monitoring in the\nouter islands. The project management organization chart is in Appendix 9.\n\n2.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  four  years  with  commencement\n\n117.\nexpected in the first quarter of 2001 and completion in 2004 (Appendix 10).\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n118.\nThe Mission held extensive discussions with Government officials and MOE staff to brief\nthem  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by\nADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for the\npurchase of equipment estimated to cost more than $500,000 and civil works estimated to cost\nmore  than  $1.0  million  will  be  carried  out  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nInternational shopping procedures will be followed for purchase of equipment between $100,000\nand  $500,000.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  or  less  will  be  awarded  in\naccordance with local competitive bidding procedures which have been examined and found to\nbe consistent with ADB guidelines. For contracts to be awarded on the basis of local competitive\nbidding,  the  bidding  documents  will  specify  eligibility  criteria  for  bidders.  Smaller  purchases\nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  will  be  carried  out  through  direct  purchase  procedures.\nAppendix 11 lists the procurement packages.\n\n119.\n\nThe main Project inputs will be as follows:\n\nCivil works will be provided to construct or upgrade classrooms, workshops, one-\nstop centers, training centers, a WTMIC, hostels, and staff housing units.\n\nTraining  equipment  and  furniture  will  be  provided  for  one-stop  centers,  training\ncenters,  high  schools,  and  WTMIC.  Reference  and  instructional  materials  for\ntraining will also be provided.\n\n(iii) \n\nConsultant services will be provided in a number of areas (para. 120).\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe staff development program will comprise in-country training for 50 teachers,\ninstructors,  and  administrators  and  10  overseas/regional  fellowships  to  improve\nthe competencies of staff, increase the quality and effectiveness of training, and\nenhance  occupational  and  training  skills  and  technical  knowledge.  Excess\nteachers  from  vocational  education  programs  will  be  retrained  to  teach  career\norientation  programs  in  high  schools  or  as  instructors  in  skills  centers.  Excess\nCMI  staff  will  also  be  trained  as  mangers  of  the  training  centers  in  Jaluit  and\nWotje.\n\n(v) \n\nResearch  projects  and  studies  will  be  carried  out  on  dropouts,  graduates  of\ntraining  agencies,  outer  island  skills  training  needs,  student  aptitudes  and\nmotivation,  employment  and  self-employment  generation,  and  traditional  and\nrural skills.\n\n\f28\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n120. Approximately  75  person-months  of  internationally  recruited  and  90  person-months  of\ndomestically  recruited  consulting  services  will  be  provided  in  areas  including  curriculum\ndevelopment,  materials  design,  development  of  skills  standards,  testing  and  certification,\nresearch,  career  guidance  and  counseling,  and  project \nimplementation.  The  project\nimplementation  support  for  the  first  three  years,  including  project,  financial,  and  accounting\nmanagement, will be provided as well as support for architectural and civil engineering design\nand  supervision.  The  Project  will  provide  consultant  services  for  setting  up  the  PIU.  An\ninternationally  recruited  project  manager  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation\nof the Project. A counterpart manager will be trained to take over in year four of the Project. In\naddition, an engineer will be provided to oversee and manage civil works and an accountant to\nmaintain project accounts. All consultants to be financed by ADB will be engaged in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\non  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  All  consultants  will  provide  essential  service  and\noperational  support  and  build  capacity  in  the  local  institutions  and  conduct  training  and  staff\nsupport. Appendix 12 presents the outline terms of reference of the consultants.\n\n5.\n\nResettlement and Land Issues\n\n121. No  resettlement  issues  are  involved  in  implementing  the  Project.  The  Government\nadvised  ADB  that  at  most  locations  involving  civil  works  the  land  rights  have  already  been\nsecured  by  the  Government.  However,  the  location  for  the  WTMIC  in  Majuro  is  yet  to  be\nselected, and land use rights will need to be obtained. The Government has assured ADB that\nno resettlement will be involved. If a significant change occurs in the land use, an appropriate\nland acquisition plan will be provided to ADB prior to implementation of the component.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursements and Imprest Account\n\n122.\nTo  facilitate  project  implementation  and  ensure  timely  release  of  funds,  an  imprest\naccount  will  be  established  for  the  Project.  The  amount  to  be  deposited  will  be  based  on\nanticipated  expenditures  to  be  incurred  for  a  3-6  month  period.  The  imprest  fund  will  be\nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement\nestablished,  operated,  and  maintained \nHandbook. ADB's statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used for reimbursement\nof expenditures and for liquidation or replenishment of each expenditure paid out of the imprest\naccount that does not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. After the initial deposit, the account will\nbe simultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis to ensure that sufficient funds\nare always available.\n\n123. All applications for withdrawal and disbursement of loan funds will be submitted to ADB\nthrough the Ministry of Finance. The Government will establish a separate imprest account for\ncounterpart  funds  and  deposit  at  least  $75,000  to  ensure  availability  of  counterpart  funding  at\nthe commencement of the Project. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s\nLoan Disbursement Handbook.\n\n7.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\n124.\nThe  PIU  will  develop  and  implement  an  action  plan  agreed  to  between  ADB  and  the\nGovernment for carrying out project activities in accordance with the timetable agreed therein.\nThe PIU, in consultation with ADB, will review the action plan and revise it as necessary. Based\non  the  action  plan,  the  PIU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports,  in  an\n\n\f29\n\nacceptable format. Reports will be submitted to ADB not later than 30 days after the end of the\nperiod  covered  by  the  report  and  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against\nestablished targets, including quality aspects; (ii) delays and problems encountered and actions\ntaken or proposed to resolve problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; and (iv) proposed\nprograms  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  and  progress  expected  during  the  next  three  months.\nThe  focus  will  normally  be  on  routine  project  monitoring  and  on  output  indicators  from  the\nproject MIS. In addition, the Government will prepare a project completion report no later than\nthree months following the Project\u2019s physical completion. The PIU will submit to ADB copies of\nall reports produced by the project consultants.\n\n8.\n\nAccounting and Auditing\n\nThe Government will establish and maintain consistent records and accounts adequate\n125.\nto identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. The PIU will (i) maintain\nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial statements are\naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;\nand  (iii)  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified\ncopies of the audited accounts and the report of the auditor. A provision of $50,000 has been\nmade  in  the  Project,  to  be  funded  under  the  loan,  for  preparing  the  Project\u2019s  annual  audited\nreports. These funds can be used to contract out auditing work and for Project-related costs of\nthe Auditor General\u2019s Office. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and\nSOE  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  should  be\nincluded in the annual audit report.\n\n9.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n126. Because of the importance of the Project, ADB will devote special attention to guiding,\nmonitoring, and evaluating project performance. ADB will review project implementation through\nquarterly reports and regular review missions. The PIU will establish a project performance and\nmonitoring system (PPMS), further detailing the qualitative and quantitative indicators specified\nin the framework in order to measure, assess, and monitor project outputs and impact in terms\nof  skills  training  efficiency  improvements,  enhanced  quality  of  career  orientation  programs,\nincreased employment opportunities for women and the youth, lowered dropout rates, increased\nreentrants to grade 10, enhanced academic proficiency of CMI entrants, improved institutional\ncapabilities, and improved equity. Project monitoring procedures will be refined and agreed with\nADB.  The  PPMS  will  be  an  integral  part  of  MOE\u2019s  MIS  to  ensure  continued  monitoring  and\nevaluation  of  project  performance  after  completion.  To  measure  project  performance  during\nproject implementation and operation, the PPMS will use a set of objectively verifiable indicators\nspecified  in  the  project  framework.  Baseline  or  benchmark  values  will  be  determined  at  the\nbeginning  of  the  implementation  period.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  information  on  the\nobjectively  verifiable  indicators  will  be  collected  periodically,  e.g.,  annually  for  most  efficiency\nand equity indicators, and segregated by gender. Project outputs and development impacts will\nbe evaluated annually and monitored frequently by the PIU.\n\nIn developing  and implementing the PPMS, special focus will be given to the needs of\n127. \nwomen  and  the  youth.  Using  the  equity-related  performance  indicators  given  in  the  project\nframework  as  a  basis,  the  PPMS  will  identify  a  specific  subset  of  indicators  to  assess  the\nProject\u2019s impact on equity by gender and by location of islands. Particular focus will be given to\npoverty alleviation and income generation.\n\n\f30\n\n10.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n128. A comprehensive midterm review of the Project will be undertaken by the Government\nand ADB at about the end of the second year of project implementation. Using the PPMS and\nother measures, the review will assess the progress and achievements of the Project against its\nobjectives, identify problems being encountered, and recommend remedial action if needed.\n\n11.\n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing\n\n129. ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance action for the recruitment of\nconsultants  and  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services  relating  to  the  early  establishment  of\nthe PIU. ADB has approved $100,000 for retroactive financing of expenditures for establishment\nof  the  PIU  and  related  implementation  support  incurred  after  loan  approval  and  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness.  Advance  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  action  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  and  Guidelines  for\nProcurement. The Government was informed that ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance action and\nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project or any part of it.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n130. Environmental  implications  of  the  project  were  reviewed  and  no  adverse  impacts  were\nidentified.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  the  siting,  design,  construction,  rehabilitation  and\noperations of the training units to be established under the Project will follow the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects,  and  other  relevant  guidelines.  Environmental  monitoring  of  the  Project\nwill  be  reported  through  the  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB.  In  the  course  of\ncurriculum  development,  the  importance  of  environment  management  and  protection  will  be\nemphasized  so  that  trainees  understand  the  impact  of  industrial  growth  on  the  long-term\nprospect of the country\u2019s environment.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n131. Based  on  the  primary  analysis  carried  out  for  the  social  impact  assessment,  the\nfollowing recommendations were incorporated into the project design.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na  community  outreach  program  to  focus  on  women  and  dropouts  particularly  in\nisolated  and  inaccessible  outer  islands,  to  increase  coverage  and  maximize\npoverty reduction impact;\n\ncourses  on  income  generating  skills,  food  production,  gender,  reproductive\nhealth, and nutrition, to be designed after consultation with NGOs and beneficiary\ngroups;\n\nparticipation of church-based organizations and NGOs, to be encouraged during\nimplementation  and  evaluation,  to  effectively  deliver  the  Project,  maximize  its\nresources, and increase project sustainability;\n\n\f31\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  WTMIC  in  Majuro  (para.  105),  to  increase  training  for  women\u2019s  groups  and\npromote handicraft production;\n\nan  intensive  public  information  and  education  campaign  targeting  women,\ndropouts,  vocational  training  students,  and  skilled  workers,  to  encourage\nincreased enrollment at the training centers and in the outreach programs; and\n\n(vi) \n\na  gender  specialist,  to  ensure  that  women\u2019s  needs  are  properly  reflected  in  the\ndesign of training courses and on the mode of delivery.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\nIncreased  employment  and  self  employment  opportunities  will  contribute  to  improved\n132.\nearnings  and  reduction  in  poverty.  With  increased  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  skills  and\nentrepreneurial  training  through  fairs,  exhibitions,  and  publicity  awareness  campaigns,  local\ncommunity  members  will  be  motivated  to  experiment  with,  for  example,  farming,  animal\nhusbandry,  fish  management,  and  processing,  to  augment  their  incomes.  The  construction  of\ndormitories for students in Ebeye, Jaluit, and Wotje skill centers will help attract students from\nremote islands. Increased economic activity will be promoted by the establishment of one-stop\ncenters in the outer islands.\n\n2.\n\nProject Benefits\n\n133. Better-trained  skilled  workers  from  an  improved  and  articulated  delivery  system  with\nupgraded training facilities, instructors, curriculum, skill standards, and certification will provide\nskilled  workers  for  industry  and  the  private  sector.  At  the  same  time,  income  generating\nmechanisms  will  be  provided  and  incomes  of  vulnerable  groups  especially  women,  will  be\nenhanced  and  will  have  beneficial  effects  on  health  and  quality  of  life.  The  number  of  school\ndropouts  will  be  reduced  and  their  wasted  potential  harnessed  through  skills  training  centers\nand education enhancement programs.\n\n134.\nThe integrated and certification system of training will allow for greater articulation within\nthe training sector and afford trainees opportunities for horizontal and vertical mobility within the\ntraining system. The dropout problem and attendant social ills will be reduced. The benefits of a\nrationalized and integrated national system will be reflected in improved quality and relevance of\ntraining and the qualitative expansion of the skilled worker pool. The private sector will have a\nwider choice of qualified workers with consequent gain in productivity.\n\n135. Coordinated  and  integrated  training  will  increase  trainee  enrolment  and  the  sharing  of\nfacilities and other resources among training agencies will result in more cost effective delivery.\nThe  efficiency  of  management  too  will  improve.  With  NTC  taking  the  pivotal  advisory  and\nregulatory role, an articulated curriculum will emerge. This together with better-trained teachers\nand managers, upgraded workshops, equipment, standardized tests, certification, and curricula\nrelevant to labor market needs will significantly improve the quality of training. The employability\nand  mobility  of  trained  workers  in  the  region  and  to  the  US  will  be  enhanced  with  the  close\nalignment  of  the  curriculum  with  that  of  the  US.  The  introduction  of  the  career  awareness\n\n\f32\n\nprogram  in  high  schools  will  motivate  and  inculcate  appropriate  attitudes  in  students  seeking\nskills training.\n\n3.\n\nAffordability and Sustainability\n\n136. Sustainability  of  skills  training  courses  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  major  problem  if  the\nCompact funds are renewed. In the unlikely event that Compact is not renewed, MOE has, from\nthe  general  fund,  budgeted  for  an  increased  expenditure  for  all  items,  including  vocational\neducation  and  skills  training,  starting  from  FY2000.  NTC\u2019s  revenue  from  the  levy  on  foreign\nworkers  is  likely  to  be  maintained  until  skilled  workers  under  the  Project  are  trained.  The\nGovernment is also currently negotiating with UNDP for additional funds. Vocational programs\nare not being expanded, and will be reformed, streamlined, and reduced. The present recurrent\ncosts provided by MOE should be adequate. CMI is the main focus in the skill delivery system,\nand  is  concentrating  on  rationalization  and  consolidation  of  inefficient  and  costly  programs.\nCMI\u2019s revenues from tuition fees are likely to increase with the projected increase in enrollment.\nCMI\u2019s Endowment Trust Fund will provide a buffer and some measures of self-sufficiency in the\nnear  future.  WIA  is  expected  to  receive  about  $840,000  for  its  programs  in  the  current  and\nsubsequent years. This will be adequate in view of the expected decline in unit costs of training\nas a result of the internal efficiency measures to be introduced under the Project. Even without\nCompact  funding,  the  Government  is  committed  to  ensuring  adequate  funding  for  vocational\neducation and skills training.\n\n137. CMI\u2019s annual recurrent costs, not covered by WIA, are estimated at $508,800 while Pell\ngrants for tuition fees are expected to total about $421,344. The shortfall of about $90,000 will\nbe  met  by  donations  and  from  the  Endowment  Fund  and  carry-over  funds.  These  expected\namounts  will  be  adequate  to  maintain  current  programs.  The  incremental  cost  as  result  of\nimplementing the Project is estimated at $205,000. The Government considers that it can afford\nthis cost and has assured ADB that adequate provision will be made in the annual budget .\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Dimensions\n\n138.\nIn  the  RMI,  disadvantaged  groups  are  present  in  the  urban  centers  and  the  outer\nislands. Although the  Government has yet to establish a poverty line or indicators for poverty,\nthe RMI\u2019s disadvantaged groups clearly include isolated islander households without trust fund\nearnings,  remittances,  or  other  sources  of  income;  people  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  their\nchildren\u2019s  public  schooling  and  medical  needs,  and  who  continue  to  depend  solely  on  limited\nGovernment-supported schools and hospitals; and migrant families (i.e., migrant within the RMI)\nwho  are  landless,  with  no  member  of  the  household  employed.  Migrant  households  are\ncommon  because  of  the  huge  displacements  resulting  from  nuclear  and  missile  testing\n(Kwajalein)  and  the  Second  World  War.  This  has  led  to  dispossession,  landlessness,  and\nfeelings of powerlessness, which perpetuate poverty. The migrants include people from Bikini,\nEnewetak, Rongelap, Utirik, and around Kwajelein atolls.\n\n139.\nThe  1999  population  census  shows  total  unemployment  at  30.9  percent  with  an\nunemployment  rate  of  females  (37.3  percent)  significantly  higher  than  that  of  males  (27.6\npercent). According to recent UNDP statistics, unemployment of urban youth is estimated at 50\npercent.11 In conjunction with such high rates of unemployment is the large disparity in income\n\n                                                          \n11 Pacific Human Development Report, 1999, UNDP.\n\n\f33\n\nlevels  between  islands.  The  mean  annual  household  income  varies  greatly  with  atolls,  with\nincome in Kwajalein approaching $14,000 due to the US military establishment, Enewetak over\n$10,000 due to nuclear payments, the main urban center of Majuro, at $8,000; while in the rest\nof the atolls it is under $2,000. To alleviate poverty, the Project will have to address the needs of\nthe unemployed, the lower income outer island atolls, and significantly disadvantaged women.\n\nThe ADB intervention must be considered in the context of resource constraints as well\n\n140.\nas the RMI\u2019s remoteness, isolation, and lack of comparative advantage or economies of scale.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\nThe findings of the social assessment study carried out by the Mission have been built\n\n141.\ninto the Project (para. 131).\n\n142.\nThe  Project  will  provide  skills  and  training  opportunities  for  about  800  urban  and  outer\nisland unemployed women and 600 youths from low-income families. The direct benefits to the\nfamilies  of  the  1,400  trainees  will  improve  the  lives  of  about  11,000  people  (approximately  20\npercent  of  the  current  population).  The  outer  islands,  which  are  isolated  from  the  capital,  will\nhave  increased  participation  in  income  generating  activities  through  (i)  improved  skills  in\nagriculture  and  fishing  technologies  for  subsistence,  and  (ii)  knowledge  about  activity  in  local\nand national produce markets. Employers will have an improved supply of local skilled workers,\neffectively  reducing  the  need  to  recruit  overseas  workers.  The  outer  islands  economies  will\nbenefit  from  the  infusion  of  new  skills  and  trained  people,  leading  to  job  creation  from\nentrepreneurial  ventures.  Families  will  directly  benefit  from  the  newly  acquired  skills  in\nhousehold management, resulting in improved nutrition.\n\n143.\nThe  Project  also  promote  self-reliance  and  empowerment  among  beneficiaries.  For\ntrainees who become employable, this will mean increased financial independence and freedom\nfrom  chronic  dependency  on  families.  With  the  right  skills  and  confidence  gained  from  the\ntraining and work experience, especially in the Majuro WTMIC, trainees will be more prepared\nto find paid employment or start their own microenterprises.\n\nGender and Development\n\n3. \n \n\n144. Development  of  gender-oriented  courses  will  encourage  female  enrollment  leading  to\nemployment  in  areas  where  female  participation  has  been  traditionally  low.  Also,  access  to\nquality  training  and  improved  facilities  under  the  Project  will  open  opportunities  for  career  and\nentrepreneurial development for women. Skills training will benefit women and their families in\nthe form of increased food production and improved nutrition. The Project will encourage active\nparticipation of existing community-based organizations and NGOs, particularly those that serve\nwomen, to ensure effective and sustained implementation of the outreach program for the outer\nislands.\n\n145.\nThe social assessment (appendix 6) revealed that women especially in the outer islands\nare  unable  to  attend  regular  classes  at  a  central  location.  Accordingly,  a  separate  community\noutreach program was included in the project design. Through the program, extension staff will\norganize training at the community level at locations closer to the clients. This will significantly\nincrease  coverage  of  the  training  and  easier  access  to  the  program  for  women  in  the  outer\nislands.\n\n\f34\n\n4. \n\nBeneficiaries\n\n146.\nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project, given the RMI\u2019s small population, will be relatively\nsignificant.  The  1,200  high  school  students  in  public  schools  and  1,380  in  private  schools  in\ngrades 9-12 will benefit from the career awareness program.\n\n147.\nThe next  group  of immediate  beneficiaries will be the 464 participants who will receive\ntraining,  retraining  or  upgrading  training  in  the  skills  centers  in  Ebeye  and  Majuro  over  the\nproject period. Some of them will find employment locally, taking over from foreign workers.\n\n148. A  third  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  mainly  from  low-income  and  other  disadvantaged\ngroups.  These  people  primarily  include  women  (all  ages),  and  young  unemployed  and\nunderemployed males in the urban centers and in the outer islands with limited opportunities for\nformal employment and no access to land or other sources of income. At least 500 women will\nbenefit from the educational, skills, and entrepreneurial training and outreach programs annually\nunder  the  Project.  They  will  include  women  who  have  left  or  have  not  yet  entered  the  labor\nforce,  and  those  who  have  spent  their  adult  lives  engaged  solely  in  subsistence  farming  or\nfishing. To ensure equitable access for women, not less than half of all course offerings will be\ntargeted at women, although courses are expected to be available to both genders.\n\n149. Elimination of vocational education from the high schools will allow more time for basic\neducation  and  strengthens  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to  improve  the  academic  content  and\ncompetency  at  the  secondary  level.  As  designed,  the  Project  incorporates  this  strategy  and  is\nexpected  to  produce  significant  improvement  in  the  competency  of  students  at  the  secondary\nand tertiary levels. Cost savings from eliminating vocational education at the secondary level will\nbe used to improve delivery of training service. A wider cross-section of the scattered population\nwill be covered more efficiently.\n\nThe  project  design  also  incorporates  a  flexible  mechanism  to  allow  secondary  school\n150.\ndropouts  to  reenter  the  academic  stream  through  the  certification  process.  The  curriculum  for\nskills  training  will  be  developed  so  as  to  augment  the  academic  aspect  of  learning  throughout\nnonformal  skills  training.  This  is  also  required  because  of  the  increasing  need  for  the  higher\nacademic proficiency required in several of the fields of skills training.\n\n151. Another  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  the  youth,  including  dropouts,  particularly  those\nfrom  the  outer  islands.  At  least  100  are  expected  to  enroll  in  the  education  enhancement\nprogram and at least 20 will reenter grade 10 in high school. Another 150 will have access to\nskills training in the training centers.\n\nC.\n\nProject Risks\n\n152. A  number  of  risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  project  implementation  and  the\nachievement of project objectives have been identified.\n\n153. Availability of Counterpart Funds. With the impending review of Compact funding, the\nGovernment  is  likely  to  face  constraints  in  mobilizing  the  increased  additional  education\nexpenditure anticipated. However, the Government has assured ADB that the needed funds will\nbe provided (para. 158 [v]).\n\n154. Availability of Teachers. Well-trained teachers and instructors for the new vocation and\nskills  curricula  will  not  be  readily  available.  The  Project  will  address  this  problem  through  the\n\n\f35\n\nstaff  development  program  whereby  sufficient  numbers  of  teachers  and  administrators  will  be\ntrained overseas and in the country. The Project is also supporting the establishment in CMI of\nan instructor training program to train instructors in selected skills areas. In addition, in-service\ntraining for vocational teachers and instructors will be conducted under the Project.\n\n155.\nInadequate  Experience  in  Project  Implementation.  MOE  staff  have  experience  in\nimplementing only one externally-assisted project: ADB\u2019s Basic Education Project (footnote 1).\nTherefore, the project manager of the Basic Education Project may be engaged to manage the\nProject after completion of his present assignment in November 2000. Arrangements have been\nmade  with  MOE  to  retain  some  of  the  counterpart  staff,  trained  under  the  Basic  Education\nProject,  to  manage  the  Project.  Special  training  will  be  given  to  PIU  staff  in  project\nimplementation. Recently, MOE has transferred an expert administrator from CMI to MOE. This\nis  expected  to  strengthen  MOE\u2019s  ability  to  implement  the  diverse  components  of  the  Project\neffectively.\n\n156. Employment  of  Graduates.  The  employment  of  trained  workers  may  be  a  constraint\nunless  the  job  market  improves,  as  is  anticipated  with  several  measures  planned  by  the\nGovernment.  Under  the  Project,  several  strategies  are  expected  to  increase  self-employment.\nFishing  and  agriculture  courses  planned  in  the  skills  centers  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje  will  help\ngenerate  interest  in  self-employment  in  these  areas.  Large  amounts  of  vegetables,  pigs,  and\npoultry are imported, and much of this could be produced in the RMI. In-shore fishing and the\nuse of coastal resources also present self-employment and income generating opportunities.\n\n157.\nLoss  of  Trained  Marshallese.  With  Marshalles  having  free  access  to  the  US,\nMarshallese  trained  under  the  Project  could  leave  the  RMI.  This  risk  could  be  contained  if\nadequate  employment  opportunities  are  created  in  the  RMI  and  the  economic  situation\nimproves.  Migration  is  not  a  total  loss  as  most  Marshallese  remit  money  home.  Eventually,\nsome return to the RMI, bringing valuable training skills acquired abroad.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n158.\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the loan covenants.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  staff  for  NTC  and  the  Department  of\nVocational  Education  of  MOE,  to  enable  them  to  efficiently  carry  out  their\nmandates.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  school-to-work  programs  and  funds  received\nunder the WIA shall be made available to NTC to carry out preliminary research\nand  needs  assessment  work  in  order  to  assist  the  curriculum  consultant  to  be\nprovided under Part A of the Project develop appropriate course outlines.\n\nThe  Government  will  make  available  to  skills  training  institutions  the  teachers\nmade  redundant  by  the  closure  of  the  high  school  vocational  education\nprograms.  Extension  teachers  from  CMI  will  also  be  seconded  to  all  the  skills\ntraining centers.\n\n\f36\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  the\nresulting benefits are monitored and evaluated on an annual basis. Within three\nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  the  PIU  establish  a\nPPMS based on specified performance indicators.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funding required for timely and\neffective project implementation will be separately provided in the annual budget\nfor each fiscal year.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  the  end  of  project  implementation  a\nminimum of 150 people will have been trained in employment oriented skills, of\nwhich  at  least  33  percent  will  be  women  of  all  age  groups  and  40  percent  are\nmale youths between 14 and 45 years.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  (a)  equal  access  of  all  training  providers  to  (i)\ntraining  materials  and  related  resources,  and  (ii)  all  curriculum  development\nundertaken  under  the  Project;  and  (b)  career  orientation  curricula  will  be\navailable to all private schools.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  has  committed  to  provide  the  required  recurrent  expenditure\nfunding  in  each  fiscal  year  beginning  FY2002.  The  additional  amount  will  be\nclearly  appropriated  to  the  education  budget  for  vocational  education  and  skills\ntraining.\n\n(ix) \n\nThe  Government  will  acquire  all  land  and  other  property  rights  required  for  the\nproject before the civil works contracts are awarded under the Project.\n\nB.\n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness\n\n159. Prior to loan effectiveness, the government has agreed to\n\n(i) \n\nestablish a project steering committee,\n\n(ii) \n\nhave MOE establish the PIU with staff and resources satisfactory to ADB, and\n\n(iii) \n\namend  the  Industries  Development  Act  1991  to  allow  MOE  to  have  overall\nresponsibility  for  planning  and  coordinating  skills  training  and  vocational\neducation in the RMI.\n\nC.\n\nLoan Disbursement\n\n160.\n\nThe Government has agreed to accomplish the following\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nprior to the loan being disbursed, the Government will deposit at least $75,000 in\nan imprest account to ensure availability of counterpart funding at the start of the\nProject; and\n\nprior  to  any  disbursement  for  the  construction  of  the  Majuro  WTMIC,  the\nGovernment will ensure that the land required for the WTMIC is made available\nin accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n\n\f37\n\nVIII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n161.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 5,276,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Skills Training\nand Vocational Education Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years\nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n6 November 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n\n\fNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page,

The  JTPA  was\nestablished, among other things, to improve the effectiveness of the JTPA whereby Marshallese\nwho face severe constraints to finding employment receive support and training to increase their\nopportunities  to  find  employment,  provide  training  and  services  to  participants,  and  maintain\nclose  relationship  with  ongoing  development  programs.  The  program  was  administered  by\nPrivate Industry Council of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The PIC has 15 members, of\nwhom 8 are from the private sector nominated by the chamber of commerce. JTPA received a\nbudget  of  about  $800,000  a  year  and  operates  a  wide  range  of  programs,  including  post\nsecondary vocational training\n\n2.\nJTPA  had  an  open  enrollment  policy,  which  provides  educational  and  vocational\nopportunities  to  youths  and  adults  14-55.  Under  the  JTPA,  vocational  training  programs  that\nprovided  skills  for  employment  or  self  employment  were  conducted  in  response  to  community\nneeds.  The  programs  included  the  training  of  school  dropouts,  out-of-school  youth,  and\nsuperannuated  civil  service  workers  following  the  recent  downsizing  of  the  civil  service.  Some\nprograms involved supervised on-the-job experience with employers as well as practical training\nin  a  working  environment.  Most  JTPA  programs  will  be  continued  under  the  Workforce\nInvestment Act (WIA). JTPA\u2019s wide variety of programs include the following.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nPreemployment and work maturity skills training is a career awareness program.\n\nOccupational skills training is an entry-level and semi-occupational skills training\nprogram  in  automotive  mechanic,  air-conditioning  and  refrigeration,  building\nmaintenance,  carpentry,  construction,  electricity,  secretarial,  small  engine,\nwelding, and sewing skills.\n\nInstitutional  skills  training  is  a  more  advanced  skill  training  program  in  areas  of\nautomotive  mechanics,  air-conditioning  and  refrigeration,  building  maintenance,\ncarpentry, construction, electricity, secretarial skills, small engine repair, welding\nand sewing.\n\nEntrepreneurship and small business operation provides training in the effective\nformation and establishment of a small business.\n\nOn-the-job  training  is  a  long-term  hands-on  training  in  partnership  with  an\nemployer  to  train  participants  in  actual  work  situations,  and  which  involves\nagreement that suitable trainees may be retained as employees.\n\nCooperative  work  experience  is  an  18  week  classroom  training  or  other\nenrichment  or  learning  program  that  is  facilitated  through  cooperation  between\nthe employer and the training agency, with the employer paying the participants.\n\nThe summer youth employment and training program is an eight-week program\nthat  is  not  meant  to  be  an  employment  track  and  aims  at  enhancing  basic\neducation  skills  of  economically  disadvantaged  youth;  encouraging  school\ncompletion or enrollment through supplementary or alternative school programs;\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nand  providing  students  exposure  to  the  world  of  work.  The  program  lasts  for\nabout  six  weeks  with  up  to  32  hours  per  week.  The  first  week  is  devoted  to\ntraining  orientation,  mathematics,  and  English  and  the  students  spend  the  next\nfive weeks with employers. Students are paid $2 an hour or $480 for 240 hours.\nThe  course  is  very  popular  and  there  are  many  applicants.  In  1997,  285\nparticipated of whom 13 completed the program and 10 were placed. This seems\nto be an expensive way of introducing students to the world of work, especially\nas  scarce  resources  can  be  put  to  better  use.  The  money  could  be  used  to\nstrengthen  the  prevocational  programs,  which  are  more  efficient  at  exposing  a\nlarge number of students to working situations.\n\n(viii)  The  school  enhancement  program  focuses  on  disadvantaged  youths  between\n\nthe ages of 14 and 16, and those who fail to enter high school.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nOff-campus  training  is  provided  to  both  public  and  private  sectors,  e.g.,  the  air\npilot  training  for  Air  Marshall  Islands,  Raytheon  World  control  in  Kwajalein,  law\nenforcement  skills  upgrading,  teacher  training  skills  upgrading,  and  canoe\nbuilding skills training.\n\nThe entrepreneurship and small business operation helps individual high school\nstudents,  unemployed  youth,  and  adults  with  employable  skills  to  assess  their\nself-employment  potential  and  develop  small  businesses.  Skills  training  in  the\nouter islands in agriculture, pearl oyster culture, and other local skills also receive\nsupport.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4\n\nMINISTRY OF EDUCATION\nORGANIZATION CHART\n(Elementary and Secondary Education)\n\nSpecial Assistant\n\nMINISTER\n\nADB Project Manager\n\nPREL Center\n\nMedia\n\nNational Training\nCouncil\n\nHeadstart\n\nBoard of Regents\nCMI\n\nRMI Scholarship\nBoard\n\nSecretary\n\nElementary & Secondary\nEducation\n\nAdministrative & Logistic\nSupport Services\n\nCurriculum & Instructional\nSupport Services\n\nElementary Education\nSupervisors\n\nSchool-to-Work\nCoordinator\n\nVocational Education\nDirector\n\nSecondary Education\nSupervisors\n\nJHS\n\nMIHS\n\nNIHS\n\nRMI-USP\nProject\n\nCounselors\n\nCounselors\n\nCounselors\n\nTeachers\n\nTeachers\n\nDept.\nHeads\n\nSchool\nNurse\n\nDept.\nHeads\n\nSchool\nNurse\n\nSecretary\n\nCooks\n\nTeachers\n\nSecurity\nGuards\n\nSecretary\n\nSecretary\n\nSecurity\nGuards\n\nSecurity\nGuards\n\nDept.\nHeads\n\nSchool\nNurse\n\nCooks\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; CMI = College of the Marshall Islands; JHS = Jaluit High School; MIHS = Marshall\nIslands High School; NIHS = Northern Islands High School; PREL = Pacific Regional Educational Laboratory; RMI =\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands; RMI/USP = Republic of the Marshall Islands/United States program.\n\n\f46\n\nMOE BUDGET\n($)\n\nDescription\n\nFY1998\n\nFY1999\n\nA.

The\nobjective was to identify the needs of disadvantaged groups, particularly women, so that these\ngroups  would  specifically  participate  in  and  benefit  from  the  Skills  Training  and  Vocational\nEducation Project. Consultations, interviews, and community workshops were conducted in two\nurban centers and two outer islands. Workshops were held for members and leaders of women\nand  youth  organizations,  other  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  church  leaders  on\nArno,  Ebeye,  Jaluit,  and  Majuro  islands  to  gather  primary  data  on  social  and  poverty  issues,\nsocial acceptability of the proposed project, skills requirements, and community perceptions on\ntraining  needs  particularly  in  the  outer  islands.  Local  and  national  government  officials  were\nconsulted  to  determine  needs,  issues,  and  priorities  in  relation  to  the  Project.  Participatory\nworkshop design was developed and conducted.\n\nB. \n\nInitial Social and Poverty Assessment\n\n1. \n\nClient Groups\n\nis  generally \n\nlow.  Per  capita \n\n2.\nLike many atoll countries, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is small (population\n50,840),  with  meager  resources  and  a  rapidly  growing  population.  The  country  is  heavily\ndependent  on  outside  assistance  to  provide  social  services  and  to  sustain  its  people.\nis  about  $770  (1999).\nEducational  attainment \nDemographically, the RMI is a young country with 43 percent of its population under 15 years\nold  and  an  average  household  size  of  8.9,  both  features  indicative  of  a  high  rate  of  natural\nincrease. Due to emigration, the annual growth rate has been drastically reduced to 1.5 percent,\na  deep  plunge  from  10  years  ago  (4.2  percent)  with  the  RMI  having  one  of  the  highest\npopulation growth rates in the world. Unemployment has more than doubled in the last 10 years\nwith almost one third of its labor force currently unemployed, the majority of which are women.\nAlthough elementary education is mandatory, one of four of its adult population is illiterate. The\nRMI  ranks  121st  out  of  175  countries  on  the  human  development  index  (HDI)  of  the  United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nincome \n\n3.\nThe  health  and  education  profile  of  the  RMI  is  alarming  and  compares  with  those  of\nmuch  poorer  countries.  The  poor  health  of  the  population  owes  much  to  poor  nutrition.  For\nexample,  the  incidence  of  overweight  and  obesity  (precursors  to  diabetes  and  other  chronic\nillnesses)  is  approximately  56.5  percent  in  adults  aged  18-50  years1  \u2014  essentially  one  out  of\ntwo  adults  has  developed  or  is  likely  to  develop  symptoms  of  diabetes  and  similar  illnesses.\nAccording  to  a  medical  doctor  interviewed  in  the  Majuro  government  hospital,  8-10  patients,\naged  40  years  and  above,  undergo  amputations  in  the  hospital  daily  due  to  diabetes-related\ncomplications.\n\nThe overall life expectancy in the RMI is 68 years \u2014 66 years for males and 69 years for\n4.\nfemales,  both  well  below  average  life  expectancies  in  developed  countries  (80+  years)  and  in\nmany  neighboring  island  countries.  The  RMI\u2019s  leading  health  risks  in  the  past  10  years  have\ngradually  changed  from  being  predominantly  communicable  to  chronic  (e.g.,  diabetes  and\nhypertension). This trend can be attributed to an unbalanced and low quality nutritional intake.\n\n                                                \n1 Findings from a survey conducted by Johns Hopkins University between 1996 and 1997.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n5.\nThe literacy rate in the RMI is only 74 percent and the school dropout rate is high in all\ngrades. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Education,2 only about 13 out of 100\nstudents who start grade 1 finish high school. Although elementary education is compulsory, an\nestimated 30 percent of children between ages 6-14 do not attend school.\n\n6.\nThe working-age population (people aged 15-64) is estimated at 27,000 (55 percent), of\nwhich  those  in  the  labor  force  comprise  14,000  (54  percent).  The  balance  of  the  working-age\npopulation  has  either  never  entered  the  labor  force  or  has  left  it,  instead  relying  mainly  on\nremittances or subsistence farming and fishing. Most of unemployed people live in rural areas,\nand comprise a majority of the rural poor. Efforts to bring this large number of people into the\nactive labor force will improve incomes and assist the development of rural areas.\n\n7.\nMost households (73 percent) rely on income derived from wages and salaries followed\nby  business  operations  and  professions  (29  percent).  Another  major  income  source  is\nretirement, survivor, and disability pensions (20 percent). Remittances from abroad account for\nan  insignificant  2  percent  of  total  income.  About  19  percent  of  households  also  earn  income\nfrom  dividends,  rental  royalties,  and  trusts  (6  percent);  and  income  from  tips,  commissions,\nbonuses, allowances, and others (13 percent).3\n\n2. \n\nClient Needs\n\n8.\nDropout rates at all grades are very high due to several factors: (i) the limited number of\nhigh schools available in the country, (ii) the poor quality of education, (iii) the limited number of\nqualified  teachers,  and  (iv)  a  widespread  lack  of  interest  towards  education.  According  to\nUNDP, dropout rates in the RMI are higher than in other Pacific countries.4\n\n9.\nThe  present  skills  training  and  delivery  uses  outdated  curricula,  poorly  trained\ninstructors,  and  old  and  inadequate  equipment,  and  lacks  facilities,  training  goals  and\nstandards,  coordination  and  cooperation  between  and  among  market  and  training  providers,\nand  certification.  These  factors  often  lead  to  a  general  malaise  of  hopelessness  and  apathy,\nparticularly  among  women  and  youth.  A  large  number  of  working-age  people  in  these\ncircumstances  become  resigned  to  staying  in  the  outer  islands  in  a  subsistence  existence  or\nmoving to the urban centers in the hope of finding employment.\n\n3.\n\nClient Demand\n\nTraining needs of the target beneficiaries, particularly women and youth,5 are: (i) skills to\n10.\nimprove food production (farming, poultry and hog raising, and fisheries); (ii) family-related skills\n(child care, sewing, cooking, gardening, nutrition, traditional medicine, reproductive health, and\nhousehold  and  small  business  management;  (iii)  traditional  skills  (canoe  building);  (iv)  values\nformation  (parenting  and  teaching  skills,  and  gender  training);  and  (v) leadership  training.\nLimited training is currently provided by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as Youth to\nYouth in Health and church organizations. Areas covered include reproductive health, nutrition,\nand income generation with focus on handicraft production and canoe making.\n\n                                                \n2 Ministry of Education. 1999-2000 Enrollment Report.\n3 1999 Census of Population and Housing, Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n4 Pacific Human Development Report, 1999: Creating Opportunities. UNDP.\n5 Based on the results of community workshops held in the Arno Ebeye, Jaluit, and Majuro, by the ADB Mission from\n\n23 August\u20136 September 2000.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\n11.\nUnder  use  of  existing  training  programs  is  caused  by  several  factors,  including\ninappropriate courses that do not meet clients\u2019 needs, inadequate facilities, poorly trained and\nlimited number of teachers, and lack of parental motivation. In practice, training and education\nare seen of lower priority than food, medical expenses, and clothing. Since most households in\nurban  centers  and  most  outer  islands  are  highly  dependent  on  imports  for  consumption,  most\ndisposable income goes to food and clothing. Medical expenses are relatively high in household\nbudgets, due to the prevalence of nutrition-related illnesses. Schooling is ranked after all three\npriority  needs  had  been  met.  Most  households  would  benefit  from  training  in  budgeting  and\nfamily planning.\n\n12. Women and youth organizations\u2019 expressed willingness to pay for training fees (in cash\nor  in  kind)  provided  that  they  get  quality  input  from  the  Project.  Since  the  US  Compact  funds\nstarted coming in about 14 years ago, a number of parents grew to expect that the Government\nwould  provide  for  all  education  needs  of  their  children.  This  is  one  of  several  reasons,  that\nparents  cited  in  interviews,  for  not  allocating  money  for  education,  although  many  expressed\ninterest in educating their children.\n\n13.\nBeneficiaries\u2019  demand  for  training  is  expected  to  increase  as  people  become  aware  of\nthe Project, its quality, appropriateness, and accessibility. The ability to pay for tuition fees can\nbe increased by using agricultural produce, for example, to pay for tuition and other expenses\nrather than hard-to-come-by cash, particularly in the outer islands.\n\n14.\nA similar practice has been successfully used by the Roman Catholic church since the\n1970s. The church\u2019s Busy Hands project provides for an avenue where cash-strapped parents\nfrom the outer islands can send their handicrafts to the church for sale and the proceeds go to\npay for their children\u2019s education fees.\n\nAlthough  a  number  of  parents  still  believe  that  formal  or  vocational  education  is  of\n15.\nsecondary  priority,  there  is  an  increasing  desire  among  families,  even  among  the  poorer\npopulation, for training to increase their income. With the faster development of cash economy\nthroughout the rural RMI compared to other Pacific countries, finding employment and income\ngenerating  opportunities  are  strong  incentives  for  people  to  access  the  training  and  other\nsupport programs provided under the Project.\n\n4.\n\nAbsorptive Capacity\n\n16.\nConduct of intensive public information and education campaigns, the development of a\ncommunity  outreach  program,  and  the  inclusion  of  housing  units  and  hostels  for  students  and\nteachers  will  contribute  to  increasing  enrollment  in  skills  and  vocational  training  programs,\nparticularly for women. In response to household survey made in early 2000, most women and\nout-of-school youths would enroll to learn skills and pay for the training, if they (i) knew about\nthe  program  and  its  objectives;  (ii)  believe  that  the  training  would  significantly  increase\nprospects for employment or enable them to start a small business in their community; (iii) were\nconvinced that the type of training is appropriate and would be of immediate use; and (iv) were\naware that training will be available to beneficiaries, particularly those (e.g., mothers) who are\nunable to leave their families for extended periods and live in the training centers during training.\n\n17. Women  and  youth  organizations  in  the  RMI  are  mainly  church-based  and  are  in  most\ncommunities  in  the  urban  centers  and  in  the  outer  islands.  Their  involvement  and  interest  in\neducation and skills training vary. During consultations with selected church organizations that\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nare  also  training  providers  (the  Roman  Catholic  church,  Pentecostal  church,  and  Salvation\nArmy), indicate that these groups started similar, though small and seasonal, training for women\nand  youth  in  the  past.  With  some  training  and  support,  the  numerous  women\u2019s  and  youth\norganizations throughout the RMI6 can take an important role in popularizing the Project and the\nimportance of skills training. Thus, motivating them to take an active role in the different stages\nof the Project, mobilizing needed resources, and sustaining the Project after its implementation.\n\n5.\n\nGender Issues\n\nTable A6: Status of Women\n\nWomen as\n% of Population\n% of Labor Force\n% of People in Paid Employment\nMembers of Parliament\n% of People in Administrative and Managerial\n\nNumber\n48.8\n27\n22\n1 out of 33\n7\n\n% of People in Professional and Technical \n\n32\n\nPositions\n\nJobs\n\nFemale Adult Literacy Rate\n% of Women not Expected to Survive up to 40\n% of Teenage Fertility Rate\nSource: UNDP. 1999. Pacific Human Development Report: Creating Opportunities.\n\n69\n12.4\n15.17\n\n18.\nMarshallese society is ambilineal with rights and inheritance traced through the maternal\nand  paternal  lines.  While,  the  matrilineal  influence  clearly  dominates,  thus  according  women\nhigh social status, control  over  inheritance and resources is normally exercised by a woman\u2019s\nbrother  or  uncle  on  her  behalf,  thus  potentially  undermining  her  actual  authority.  Clan  rights,\nwhich  include  land  entitlements  and  traditional  authority,  are  passed  down  through  matrilineal\nline.\n\nThis setup is reflected especially in education. For example, enrollment in skills training\n19.\nand  vocational  education  is  usually  low  for  females  since  most  courses,  except  for  selected\nofferings (cooking and sewing) are mainly tailored to the needs of males. Traditionally, although\nenjoying high social status, Marshallese women stay at home to give birth and take care of the\nchildren.  Although  Marshallese  women  are  entering  the  job  market  in  increasing  numbers,\nbecoming  involved  in  politics,  or  starting  their  own  businesses,  much  more  public  information\nand  education  is  needed  on  the  role  of  women,  especially  in  the  outer  islands.  Greater\nopportunities  for  meaningful  participation  by  women  in  the  socioeconomic  spheres  of\nMarshallese society are needed.\n\n20.\nAlso,  the  incidence  of  teenage  pregnancies  is  increasing.  Women  leaders  consulted\ncited  this  issue  as  a  major  barrier  to  young  women  continuing  their  education  (formal  or\ninformal).  Although  traditionally,  when  a  pregnant  daughter  does  not  get  married,  parents  are\nexpected to rear the child to allow the young mother to continue studying, this is not happening\nin most cases.\n\n                                                \n6 Canada  Fund,  according  to  a  study  conducted  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  in  1998,  estimated\n\nthat there are around 600 such organizations in RMI.\n\n7 Highest in 15 countries covered by the 1999 Pacific Human Development Report: Creating Opportunities. UNDP.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\nBased on these factors, development of gender-oriented courses will encourage female\n21.\nenrollment.  Also,  conduct  of  training  with  stress  on  sex  education,  reproductive  health,  and\ncontraception  will  be  prioritized,  thereby,  limiting  teenage  pregnancies,  improving  women\u2019s\neconomic  prospects,  and  limiting  family  size.  Also,  access  to  quality  training  and  improved\nfacilities  will  provide  better  career  and  entrepreneurial  development  opportunities  for  women,\nparticularly for young mothers. Moreover, skills training will benefit women and their families in\nthe  form  of  increased  food  production  and  improved  nutrition  in  their  homes.  Lastly,  women\u2019s\nparticipation,  through  their  numerous  groups  actively  working  in  the  communities,  will  be\nencouraged  through  the  provision  of  training  and  resources  to  effect  meaningful  changes  not\nonly to their lives but also to their families.\n\n6.\n\nPotential Adverse Impacts\n\nNo  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated.  Women  and  youth  have  been  identified  as\n\n22.\ncontinuing to need additional support to improve current self-help initiatives.\n\nC.\n\nSummary of Findings/Recommendations\n\n23.\n\nThe main findings include\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  proposed  skills  and  vocational  training  project  is  perceived  as  a  timely  and\nneeded  intervention  by  the  different  stakeholders  including  NGOs,  community-\nbased  organizations,  church  organizations,  local  government  officials,  and\ncommunity leaders and members;\npriority training needs by community leaders and members consulted, particularly\nin the outer islands, are for income generation, food security, reproductive health,\nnutrition, and value formation;\nlack  of  information  on  and  limited  access  to  available  skills  training  by  women\nand  youth  groups,  aside  from  those  selectively  provided  by  church  groups  and\nNGOs;\nNGOs  and  church  organizations  are  implementing  selective  and  limited  skills\ntraining  to  respond  to  community  needs  in  the  urban  centers  and  the  outer\nislands;\ntraining centers are lacking, particularly in the outer islands;\ncommunities/groups  consulted  are  willing  to  pay  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  for  quality\ntraining  that  would  facilitate  creation  of  employment  or  establishment  of  an\nenterprise; and\na  significant  amount  of  human  resources  are  untapped  and  unmotivated  (e.g.,\nschool dropouts and women).\n\nBased on the above findings, the following recommendations were incorporated into the\n\n24.\nproject design:\n\nPrioritize and target communities and focus on women and dropouts particularly\nin  isolated  and  inaccessible  outer  islands  to  maximize  the  Project\u2019s  poverty\nreduction  impact.  To  make  this  possible,  a  community  outreach  program  is\nincorporated in the Project.\n\nCourse  offerings  will  focus  on  income  generating  skills  and  on  food  production,\ngender,  reproductive  health,  and  nutrition.  Interventions  to  focus  on  developing\nbeneficiaries and NGOs need to be conducted before course development.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 6, page 6\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in\nthe  Project,  particularly  those  affiliated  with  church  organizations  in  the  RMI.\nTheir involvement will be encouraged during project preparation, implementation,\nand evaluation in order to effectively deliver the Project, maximize its resources,\nand increase its sustainability.\n\nThe Majuro women\u2019s groups recommendation for the establishing a training and\nmarketing  center  for  women  will  be  supported  under  the  Project.  This  is  to\nincrease  the  training  capacity  of  these  groups  to  promote  handicraft  production\n(with  emphasis  on  quality)  and  facilitate  enterprise  development  initiated  by\nwomen.\n\nAn intensive public information and education campaign will be developed before\nand  carried  out  during  project  implementation.  Women,  dropouts,  vocational\ntraining students, and skilled workers will be targeted by the campaign in order to\nencourage  increased  enrollment  in  the  course  in  the  training  centers  and  the\noutreach programs.\n\n(vi) \n\nA  gender  specialist  is  included  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  that\nwomen\u2019s  needs  are  properly  reflected  in  the  design  and  delivery  of  training\ncourses.\n\n(vii)  Consultations and dialogues with community leaders and members will continue.\nThese  groups  commended  ADB  for  initiating  this  participatory  approach  and\nexpressed  their  willingness  to  be  involved  in  this  Project  throughout  the\nimplementation period and in other future initiatives by ADB.\n\n\f53\n\nLOGICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nIndicators and Targets\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nGoal\nImproved economic\nself-reliance\n\nPurpose\n1.Increased income-\n\ngenerating\nopportunities\nespecially for\nwomen and the\nyouth in the outer\nislands\n\n2.Increased\n\nemployment\nespecially for\nwomen and the\nyouth in the outer\nislands\n\nOutputs\n1.
