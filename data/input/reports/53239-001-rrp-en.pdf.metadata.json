The report also describes the proposed administration of \na loan of  up  to  $45,000,000  to be  provided by the  Leading  Asia\u2019s  Private Infrastructure  Fund1 \n(LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.  \n \n2. \nThe project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 megawatt (MW) combined \ncycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant in the Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park of Rayong Province. \nThe project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) program and \nwill  be  implemented  under  a  25-year  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  Electricity \nGenerating  Authority  of Thailand (EGAT)  and  a 25-year  gas  sales  agreement  with  PTT  Public \nCompany  Limited (PTT).  The  project  sponsors  are Gulf  Energy  Development  Public  Company \nLimited  (GED),  one  of  Thailand\u2019s  largest  power  generation  companies,  and  Mitsui  &  Co.,  Ltd. \n(Mitsui), one of Japan\u2019s largest trading companies. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  With  the  aim  of  reaching  high-income  country  status  by  2032, \nThailand launched Thailand 4.0, a development model to pull the country out of the middle-income \ntrap by creating a value-based economy driven by innovation. To put Thailand 4.0 into action, the \nGovernment of Thailand adopted the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) development plan, which \nwill be the prime economic growth driver for the  country till 2028.2 The EEC development plan \nbuilds  on  the  Eastern  Seaboard  Development  Program  (ESDP),  which  is  credited  with  the \ncountry\u2019s  rapid  industrial  transformation.  The  ESDP,  launched  in  1982,  established  major \nindustries along Thailand\u2019s eastern seaboard (e.g., petrochemicals, electronics, and automotive \nparts)  and  facilitated  major  investments  in  infrastructure  (e.g.,  ports,  highways,  power  plants, \nwater supply, and industrial estates).  \n \n4. \nDuring 1982\u20132002, the ESDP contributed remarkable annual growth rates in export values \n(12%), industrial sector expansion (12%), and gross domestic product (7%). The national poverty \nlevel declined substantially from 67% in 1986 to below 9% in 2016. However, Thailand\u2019s economy \nthen began to stagnate at middle-income levels, preventing it from graduating to the ranks of high-\nincome countries. Building on the success of the ESDP, the government aims to promote the next \ngeneration  of  industries  and  infrastructure  through  its  flagship  EEC  development  plan.  This \nincludes  mega  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  centered  on  transport  and  logistics\u2013\u2013e.g., \ninternational  airport  expansion  (U-Tapao),  deep  sea  port  expansion  (Map  Ta  Phut  and  Laem \nChabang), the  country\u2019s  first  high-speed  train  connecting the three major  international  airports \n(Suvarnabhumi,  Don  Muang,  and  U-Tapao)\u2013\u2013and  other  investments  in  industry,  tourism, \nhospitals, and smart cities.3 In the first 5 years, the total investment is estimated to amount B1.7 \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \n2  The EEC development plan will be implemented across an area of more than 13,000 square kilometers in the three \n\neastern provinces of Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong. \n\n3  The  EEC  development  plan  aims  to  promote  10  industry  clusters:  (i)  next-generation  automotive,  (ii)  intelligent \nelectronics, (iii) advanced agriculture and biotechnology, (iv) food processing, (v) tourism, (vi) advanced robotics, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftrillion ($55 billion), of which B1.4 trillion will be from the private sector. Infrastructure investment \naccounts  for  44%  at  B752  billion.  Based  on  these  investments,  the  EEC  development  plan  is \nexpected to achieve economic growth of 5%, create more than 100,000 jobs, and attract 10 million \nmore tourists annually. \n \n5. \nOne  of  the  major  challenges  of  the  EEC  development  plan  is  how  to  finance  these \ninvestments because of its unprecedented scale and because the majority of the investment will \nbe  made  by the  private  sector  or  through  a  public\u2013private  partnership.  Although  Thailand  has \nestablished a robust local banking sector, which is liquid and provides long-term local currency \nfinancing that is suitable for infrastructure projects, local banks alone will not be able to fund all \nthe investments under the EEC development plan.4 On the other hand, local banks and a small \nnumber  of  international  banks,  namely  Japanese,  have  dominated  Thailand\u2019s  infrastructure \nfinancing  market.  Aside  from  three  Japanese  mega-banks,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), only two international banks have \nfinanced multiple infrastructure projects in Thailand since 2009. This contrasts with regional peers \nsuch  as  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Singapore,  which  have  more  international  banks  in  their \ninfrastructure finance markets.5 Therefore, mobilizing international lenders with limited experience \nin Thailand will be key for successfully financing the EEC development plan.  \n \n6. \nThe  Eastern  Economic  Corridor  Independent  Power  Project  provides  an  excellent \nopportunity to secure international lenders for the EEC development plan. An IPP centrally located \nin the EEC, it is one of the key utility projects under the EEC development plan. The project will \nbe the fourth-largest power plant and one of the largest CCGT power plants in the country. It will \nbecome fully operational by 2024, which coincides with the EEC development plan\u2019s expected \nincrease in energy demand and Thailand\u2019s largest decommissioning of aging power plants; more \nthan 8,500 MW will retire between 2020 and 2025 (equivalent to 20% of current national capacity). \nThe project will also help ensure reliable and cost-effective power in the EEC because of its high \nefficiency relative to other plants in the area. It will use natural gas and employ the latest CCGT \ntechnology with a maximum rated efficiency of greater than 63%.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7. \nProject  design.  The  project  is  being  developed  under  Thailand\u2019s  IPP  program,  which \nallows the private sector to build, own, and operate power projects with a generating capacity of \nmore than 90 MW. The program was established in 1994 to promote efficient procurement and \nfoster competition to minimize the government\u2019s capital burden and lower the cost of electricity. \nIPP contracts are awarded through a bidding process based on the lowest levelized electricity \nprice. Since its inception, the program has successfully tendered three IPP bidding rounds and \nawarded 13 contracts totaling more than 16,000 MW. The EEC Independent Power Project was \nawarded the contract in the latest IPP bidding round, which concluded in 2013. \n \nThe project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 MW CCGT power plant in \n8. \nthe Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park of Rayong Province, about 150 kilometers (km) southeast of \n\n \n\n(vii) integrated aviation, (viii) medical hub and comprehensive health care services, (ix) biofuels and biochemicals, \nand (x) digital technology. \n\n4  Total loan exposure of the five largest Thai banks to the utility sector, which includes infrastructure such as power \nand transport, was estimated at B755 billion as of March 2019 based on their latest financial statements and material \nprovided by the Bank of Thailand (Bank of Thailand. 2019.  Performance of the Thai Banking System in the First \nQuarter of 2019. Bangkok.) The infrastructure investment  planned under the EEC development plan described in \npara. 4 almost equals this amount. Since bank loans in Thailand are only growing at 5.6% annually, Thai banks alone \ncannot finance such an amount.   \n\n5  Inframation News database.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fBangkok. The power plant is divided into four separate CCGT blocks with a contracted capacity \nof  625  MW  each.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED  MHPS  is  a  core  subsidiary  of \nMitsubishi  Heavy  Industries,  which  is  rated  A-  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  (S&P),  and  is  one  of  the \nlargest and most experienced companies in thermal power generation systems globally. EGAT \nwill  construct  a  7-km  transmission  line  to  connect  the  power  plant  to  the  grid,  and  a  0.1-km \ninterconnecting gas pipeline will be constructed as part of the project and transferred to PTT upon \ncompletion.  The  project  benefits  from  strong  contractual  arrangements  with  creditworthy, \ninvestment-grade counterparties. \n \n9. \nBorrower  and  sponsors.  Gulf  PD,  the  borrower,  was  established  in  2012  to  develop, \nconstruct, own, and operate the project. It is 100% owned by Independent Power Development, \na joint venture between GED with 70% and Mitsui with 30% of the shares. \n \n10. \nGED is a leading power generation company with the largest portfolio of contracted PPAs \nin Thailand. It has focused primarily on developing gas-fired power plants in Thailand (under the \nIPP) and small power producer programs. As of July 2019, it had a portfolio of 33 power projects \n(27 operational, 2 under construction, 4 under development) with a total capacity of 11,911 MW \n(equity capacity of 6,727 MW). GED was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in December \n2017,  and  as  of  12  September  2019  had  a  market  capitalization  of  about  $10.3  billion.  ADB \nparticipated in GED\u2019s initial public offering as a cornerstone investor with a 3% equity stake.6 \n \n11.  Mitsui was established in 1947 as a general trading company and has since evolved into \na diversified multinational company. It is one of Japan\u2019s largest trading companies with a proven \ntrack  record  of  developing  more  than  74  power  projects  globally.  Its  gross  power  generation \ncapacity totals 34 gigawatts, and its net equity capacity totals 9.9 gigawatts. Mitsui has expertise \nin gas-fired power generation with such projects accounting for more than half of its total equity \ncapacity.  It  is  rated  A  by  S&P,  A3  by  Moody\u2019s  Investors  Service,  and  AA-  by  Rating  and \nInvestment Information, Inc. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n \n12. \nImpact. The project is aligned with Thailand 4.0, the government\u2019s strategy designed to \npromote and support innovation, creativity, research and development, higher technologies, and \ngreen technologies.7 It will also help improve Thailand\u2019s power system stability and reliability.8 \n \n13. \nOutcome. The project\u2019s outcome is an increased delivery of stable and reliable power to \nthe EEC area. Annually, the project will deliver at least 16,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity. When \ncompared to the existing energy mix in Thailand, the project will avoid at least 1 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent emissions per annum.9 \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n\n6  Of the shares, 48 million were allocated to ADB and 16 million to LEAP.

Following ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nthe  project  meets  the  operational  priorities  of  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability. 10  Furthermore,  the  project \nsupports private sector participation in infrastructure to fill the infrastructure gap and catalyze and \nmobilize  financial  resources  for  development.11 ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  project  is  in  line  with  its \ncountry partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand12 and its country operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021,13 both  of  which  promote  the  support  for  private  sector  development  and  energy \ninfrastructure, and respond to Thailand\u2019s needs and priorities as an upper middle-income country. \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  associated  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \n16. \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,14 which emphasizes investments in energy efficiency, least-\ncost supply, and private sector participation. ADB supports projects that use efficient technologies \nsuch as CCGT or incorporate state-of-the-art emission control equipment. \n \n17. \nLessons from previous operations.

ADB  has  been  engaged  in  the  financial \nstructuring from early on, and its role as an anchor lender provides credibility to the project and \nits  developers  to  help  attract  other  financial  institutions  to  participate.  Furthermore,  the  B  loan \nenables  international  banks  that  have  limited  experience  in  Thailand  to  participate.  The \nmobilization of these new lenders will help diversify the lender base in Thailand\u2019s infrastructure \nfinancing market, which is key for huge investments expected under the EEC development plan. \nADB also supports the project\u2019s use of the most advanced technology in terms of high-efficiency \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fand  low-carbon,  which  has  a  maximum  rated  efficiency  of  greater  than  63%.  Together  with \nChonburi, the project will be one of the first commercial deployments of MHPS\u2019s most advanced \nand efficient turbine; ADB\u2019s endorsement and the subsequent demonstration may lead to other \ndevelopers adopting it faster and reduce the perceived risk by other financial institutions. \n \n21. \nADB plays a lead role in the due diligence process\u2013\u2013especially concerning environmental, \nsocial, gender, and integrity standards\u2013\u2013and in the negotiations and structuring of the transaction. \nMore specifically, ADB will require the project to adopt more stringent safeguard measures than \nnational standards require and insist on certain gender elements, such as employment targets for \nwomen and gender-based violence (GBV) initiatives.  \n \nC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  A),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).17 A  draft  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment \n(ESIA) and management plans were prepared by Gulf PD and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 17 \nMay 2019.18  \n \n23. \nADB  undertook  due  diligence  and  reviewed  the  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  and \nsocial impacts and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The ESIA was updated to meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \nThe environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of Gulf \nPD to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n24. \nEnvironment.  The  key  construction  phase  impacts  will  include  temporary  noise,  dust, \ntraffic,  solid  and  liquid  waste  generation,  hazardous  substances,  and  occupational  and  public \nhealth and safety issues. During operation, key potential impacts include air and noise emissions, \nand  effluent  discharges.  The  ESIA  management  plans  will  avoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  the \nexpected impacts and risks. Stack emissions will comply with applicable guidelines and national \nstandards. Air dispersion modeling confirmed that national ambient air quality standards will be \nmet,  and  the  project  will  not  contribute  more  than  25%  of  the  national  standards  at  sensitive \nreceptor locations.19 The ESIA considered cumulative impacts on the air quality combined with \nthe impact from other power plants operating and planned within 15 km of the project. The noise \ncalculation results for construction and operation indicated that noise levels will be elevated by \nless than 3 A-weighted decibels at the nearest sensitive receptors if the proposed temporary and \npermanent noise barriers are installed. The ESIA confirmed that effluent discharges will not have \n\n \n\n17 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n18 https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/tha-53239-001-eia. \n19 The project\u2019s 25% threshold value contribution to ambient air quality at sensitive receptors will not be met for nitrogen \ndioxide (1-hour average) when the plant is running 100% on diesel. The highest predicted nitrogen dioxide (1-hour \naverage) contribution will be between up to 25.49% and 26.53% of the ambient standard at the following sensitive \nreceptors: Nikhom Sang Ton Eng 9 School, Pasitharam Temple, Mab Yang Phon Temple, and Village No 7\u2013\u2013Ban \nWang Pla. However, the concentration of more than 25% is predicted to occur once in 3 years. Diesel will only be \nused temporarily as back-up fuel if gas is not available. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fsignificant impacts on the receiving waters. Public consultation was undertaken  by Gulf PD as \npart  of  the  ESIA  process  in  three  phases.  Public  concerns  and  feedback,  including  mitigation \nmeasures for concerns raised by stakeholders, have been included in the ESIA and disclosed to \nthe public. \n \n25. \nSocial. The project is located in Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park and covers an area of \napproximately 492 rai (79 hectares). The ESIA and ADB due diligence found no legacy issues \nregarding the historical transfer of the project land. EGAT will construct the proposed transmission \nline.  The  proposed  alignment,  based  on  an  alternative  route  analysis,  avoids  physical \ndisplacement. An assessment of EGAT\u2019s right-of-way acquisition procedures was undertaken as \npart  of  due  diligence.  The land compensation (for  the  tower  and  the  right  of  way)  is based  on \nmarket value and considers any losses during the construction and maintenance phases. Gulf \nPD  will  participate  in  EGAT\u2019s  ongoing  consultations  process  with  landowners  and  other \nstakeholders to address any concerns. The ESIA recorded no presence of distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous peoples or ethnic minority groups in the project\u2019s area of influence. The social due \ndiligence confirmed the same. \n \n26. \nGender and other social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender \nelements. Gulf PD will provide at least 15% of total employment in the operation phase to women \nand implement the initiatives to prevent GBV during the construction phase. This will include (i) \nmaking  zero  tolerance  policies  and  enforcing  a  code  of  conduct,  (ii)  having  GBV  signs  across \nconstruction sites and labor camps, (iii) assigning focal points to deal with GBV issues, and (iv) \nmaking  GBV  training  mandatory  for  all  staff  and  contractors  on  site.  Gulf  PD  will  comply  with \nnational labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures \nto comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.20 The client will report regularly \nto  ADB  on  (i)  its  and  its  contractors\u2019  compliance  with  such  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  will  follow  ADB  requirements. 21 \nProgress on the agreed gender actions will be monitored during ADB staff supervision visits and \nlender\u2019s technical adviser visits, and will be included in the company\u2019s annual monitoring report. \n \nB. \n \nGulf PD was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n27. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \n29. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \n\nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nAssurances \n\n \n\n20 ADB. 2003.
