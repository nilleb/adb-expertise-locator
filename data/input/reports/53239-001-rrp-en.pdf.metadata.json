THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $135,000,000 comprising (i) an A loan of up to $50,000,000 and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$85,000,000,  to  Gulf  PD  Company  Limited  (Gulf  PD)  for  the  Eastern  Economic  Corridor \nIndependent Power Project in Thailand. The report also describes the proposed administration of \na loan of up to $45,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund1 \n(LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.  \n \n2.  The project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 megawatt (MW) combined \ncycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant in the Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park of Rayong Province. \nThe project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) program and \nwill be implemented under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and a 25-year gas sales agreement with PTT Public \nCompany Limited (PTT). The project sponsors are Gulf Energy Development Public Company \nLimited (GED), one of Thailand\u2019s largest power generation companies, and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. \n(Mitsui), one of Japan\u2019s largest trading companies. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. With the aim of reaching high-income country status by 2032, \nThailand launched Thailand 4.0, a development model to pull the country out of the middle-income \ntrap by creating a value-based economy driven by innovation. To put Thailand 4.0 into action, the \nGovernment of Thailand adopted the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) development plan, which \nwill be the prime economic growth driver for the country till 2028.2 The EEC development plan \nbuilds on the Eastern Seaboard Development Program (ESDP), which is credited with the \ncountry\u2019s  rapid  industrial  transformation.  The  ESDP,  launched  in  1982,  established  major \nindustries along Thailand\u2019s eastern seaboard (e.g., petrochemicals, electronics, and automotive \nparts) and facilitated major investments in infrastructure (e.g., ports, highways, power plants, \nwater supply, and industrial estates).  \n \n4.  During 1982\u20132002, the ESDP contributed remarkable annual growth rates in export values \n(12%), industrial sector expansion (12%), and gross domestic product (7%). The national poverty \nlevel declined substantially from 67% in 1986 to below 9% in 2016. However, Thailand\u2019s economy \nthen began to stagnate at middle-income levels, preventing it from graduating to the ranks of high-\nincome countries. Building on the success of the ESDP, the government aims to promote the next \ngeneration of industries and infrastructure through its flagship EEC development plan. This \nincludes mega public\u2013private partnership projects centered on transport and logistics\u2013\u2013e.g., \ninternational airport expansion (U-Tapao), deep sea port expansion (Map Ta Phut and Laem \nChabang), the country\u2019s first high-speed train connecting the three major international airports \n(Suvarnabhumi,  Don  Muang,  and  U-Tapao)\u2013\u2013and  other  investments  in  industry,  tourism, \nhospitals, and smart cities.3 In the first 5 years, the total investment is estimated to amount B1.7 \n \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \n2  The EEC development plan will be implemented across an area of more than 13,000 square kilometers in the three \neastern provinces of Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong. \n3  The EEC development plan aims to promote 10 industry clusters: (i) next-generation automotive, (ii) intelligent \nelectronics, (iii) advanced agriculture and biotechnology, (iv) food processing, (v) tourism, (vi) advanced robotics, \n \n ", "2 \ntrillion ($55 billion), of which B1.4 trillion will be from the private sector. Infrastructure investment \naccounts for 44% at B752 billion. Based on these investments, the EEC development plan is \nexpected to achieve economic growth of 5%, create more than 100,000 jobs, and attract 10 million \nmore tourists annually. \n \n5.  One of the major challenges of the EEC development plan is how to finance these \ninvestments because of its unprecedented scale and because the majority of the investment will \nbe made by the private sector or through a public\u2013private partnership. Although Thailand has \nestablished a robust local banking sector, which is liquid and provides long-term local currency \nfinancing that is suitable for infrastructure projects, local banks alone will not be able to fund all \nthe investments under the EEC development plan.4 On the other hand, local banks and a small \nnumber of international banks, namely Japanese, have dominated Thailand\u2019s infrastructure \nfinancing market. Aside from three Japanese mega-banks, the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), only two international banks have \nfinanced multiple infrastructure projects in Thailand since 2009. This contrasts with regional peers \nsuch as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, which have more international banks in their \ninfrastructure finance markets.5 Therefore, mobilizing international lenders with limited experience \nin Thailand will be key for successfully financing the EEC development plan.  \n \n6.  The  Eastern  Economic  Corridor  Independent  Power  Project  provides  an  excellent \nopportunity to secure international lenders for the EEC development plan. An IPP centrally located \nin the EEC, it is one of the key utility projects under the EEC development plan. The project will \nbe the fourth-largest power plant and one of the largest CCGT power plants in the country. It will \nbecome fully operational by 2024, which coincides with the EEC development plan\u2019s expected \nincrease in energy demand and Thailand\u2019s largest decommissioning of aging power plants; more \nthan 8,500 MW will retire between 2020 and 2025 (equivalent to 20% of current national capacity). \nThe project will also help ensure reliable and cost-effective power in the EEC because of its high \nefficiency relative to other plants in the area. It will use natural gas and employ the latest CCGT \ntechnology with a maximum rated efficiency of greater than 63%.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7.  Project design. The project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s IPP program, which \nallows the private sector to build, own, and operate power projects with a generating capacity of \nmore than 90 MW. The program was established in 1994 to promote efficient procurement and \nfoster competition to minimize the government\u2019s capital burden and lower the cost of electricity. \nIPP contracts are awarded through a bidding process based on the lowest levelized electricity \nprice. Since its inception, the program has successfully tendered three IPP bidding rounds and \nawarded 13 contracts totaling more than 16,000 MW. The EEC Independent Power Project was \nawarded the contract in the latest IPP bidding round, which concluded in 2013. \n \n8.  The project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 MW CCGT power plant in \nthe Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park of Rayong Province, about 150 kilometers (km) southeast of \n \n(vii) integrated aviation, (viii) medical hub and comprehensive health care services, (ix) biofuels and biochemicals, \nand (x) digital technology. \n4  Total loan exposure of the five largest Thai banks to the utility sector, which includes infrastructure such as power \nand transport, was estimated at B755 billion as of March 2019 based on their latest financial statements and material \nprovided by the Bank of Thailand (Bank of Thailand. 2019. Performance of the Thai Banking System in the First \nQuarter of 2019. Bangkok.) The infrastructure investment planned under the EEC development plan described in \npara. 4 almost equals this amount. Since bank loans in Thailand are only growing at 5.6% annually, Thai banks alone \ncannot finance such an amount.   \n5  Inframation News database.  \n ", "3 \nBangkok. The power plant is divided into four separate CCGT blocks with a contracted capacity \nof 625 MW each. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED MHPS is a core subsidiary of \nMitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is rated A- by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), and is one of the \nlargest and most experienced companies in thermal power generation systems globally. EGAT \nwill construct a 7-km transmission line to connect the power plant to the grid, and a 0.1-km \ninterconnecting gas pipeline will be constructed as part of the project and transferred to PTT upon \ncompletion.  The  project  benefits  from  strong  contractual  arrangements  with  creditworthy, \ninvestment-grade counterparties. \n \n9.  Borrower and sponsors. Gulf PD, the borrower, was established in 2012 to develop, \nconstruct, own, and operate the project. It is 100% owned by Independent Power Development, \na joint venture between GED with 70% and Mitsui with 30% of the shares. \n \n10.  GED is a leading power generation company with the largest portfolio of contracted PPAs \nin Thailand. It has focused primarily on developing gas-fired power plants in Thailand (under the \nIPP) and small power producer programs. As of July 2019, it had a portfolio of 33 power projects \n(27 operational, 2 under construction, 4 under development) with a total capacity of 11,911 MW \n(equity capacity of 6,727 MW). GED was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in December \n2017, and as of 12 September 2019 had a market capitalization of about $10.3 billion. ADB \nparticipated in GED\u2019s initial public offering as a cornerstone investor with a 3% equity stake.6 \n \n11.  Mitsui was established in 1947 as a general trading company and has since evolved into \na diversified multinational company. It is one of Japan\u2019s largest trading companies with a proven \ntrack record of developing more than 74 power projects globally. Its gross power generation \ncapacity totals 34 gigawatts, and its net equity capacity totals 9.9 gigawatts. Mitsui has expertise \nin gas-fired power generation with such projects accounting for more than half of its total equity \ncapacity. It is rated A by S&P, A3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and AA- by Rating and \nInvestment Information, Inc. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n12.  Impact. The project is aligned with Thailand 4.0, the government\u2019s strategy designed to \npromote and support innovation, creativity, research and development, higher technologies, and \ngreen technologies.7 It will also help improve Thailand\u2019s power system stability and reliability.8 \n \n13.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome is an increased delivery of stable and reliable power to \nthe EEC area. Annually, the project will deliver at least 16,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity. When \ncompared to the existing energy mix in Thailand, the project will avoid at least 1 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent emissions per annum.9 \n \n \n6  Of the shares, 48 million were allocated to ADB and 16 million to LEAP.

This \ncompares with the Thai grid emission factor of 439 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt-hour. \n ", "4 \n14.  Outputs. The outputs will comprise (i) construction and commissioning of a combined-\ncycle natural gas power plant, and indirectly (ii) employment, and (iii) local purchase of goods and \nservices. An additional output is (iv) the initiatives to prevent gender-based violence during the \nconstruction phase.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Following ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nthe project meets the operational priorities of tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability.10 Furthermore,  the  project \nsupports private sector participation in infrastructure to fill the infrastructure gap and catalyze and \nmobilize financial resources for development.11 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its \ncountry partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand12 and its country operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021,13 both of which promote the support for private sector development and energy \ninfrastructure, and respond to Thailand\u2019s needs and priorities as an upper middle-income country. \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and associated ADB operations. The project is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,14 which emphasizes investments in energy efficiency, least-\ncost supply, and private sector participation. ADB supports projects that use efficient technologies \nsuch as CCGT or incorporate state-of-the-art emission control equipment. \n \n17.  Lessons from previous operations.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance consists of (i) a proposed A loan of up to $50 million, (ii) a \nproposed B loan of up to $85 million, and (iii) a proposed parallel loan of up to $45 million to be \nprovided by LEAP and administered by ADB. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  The financing needs of the project are substantial, requiring about $1.15 billion of long-\nterm,  limited-recourse  debt.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  of  $50  million  is  catalyzing  $894  million  of \ncofinancing including a $85 million B loan and a $45 million LEAP parallel loan. This means about \n$18 of cofinancing for every $1 of ADB assistance. ADB has been engaged in the financial \nstructuring from early on, and its role as an anchor lender provides credibility to the project and \nits developers to help attract other financial institutions to participate. Furthermore, the B loan \nenables  international  banks  that  have  limited  experience  in  Thailand  to  participate.  The \nmobilization of these new lenders will help diversify the lender base in Thailand\u2019s infrastructure \nfinancing market, which is key for huge investments expected under the EEC development plan. \nADB also supports the project\u2019s use of the most advanced technology in terms of high-efficiency \n ", "6 \nand low-carbon, which has a maximum rated efficiency of greater than 63%. Together with \nChonburi, the project will be one of the first commercial deployments of MHPS\u2019s most advanced \nand efficient turbine; ADB\u2019s endorsement and the subsequent demonstration may lead to other \ndevelopers adopting it faster and reduce the perceived risk by other financial institutions. \n \n21.  ADB plays a lead role in the due diligence process\u2013\u2013especially concerning environmental, \nsocial, gender, and integrity standards\u2013\u2013and in the negotiations and structuring of the transaction. \nMore specifically, ADB will require the project to adopt more stringent safeguard measures than \nnational standards require and insist on certain gender elements, such as employment targets for \nwomen and gender-based violence (GBV) initiatives.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n22.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category A), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).17 A draft environmental and social impact assessment \n(ESIA) and management plans were prepared by Gulf PD and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 17 \nMay 2019.18  \n \n23.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the project\u2019s potential environmental and \nsocial impacts and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The ESIA was updated to meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \nThe environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of Gulf \nPD to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n24.  Environment. The key construction phase impacts will include temporary noise, dust, \ntraffic, solid and liquid waste generation, hazardous substances, and occupational and public \nhealth and safety issues. During operation, key potential impacts include air and noise emissions, \nand effluent discharges. The ESIA management plans will avoid, minimize, and mitigate the \nexpected impacts and risks. Stack emissions will comply with applicable guidelines and national \nstandards. Air dispersion modeling confirmed that national ambient air quality standards will be \nmet, and the project will not contribute more than 25% of the national standards at sensitive \nreceptor locations.19 The ESIA considered cumulative impacts on the air quality combined with \nthe impact from other power plants operating and planned within 15 km of the project. The noise \ncalculation results for construction and operation indicated that noise levels will be elevated by \nless than 3 A-weighted decibels at the nearest sensitive receptors if the proposed temporary and \npermanent noise barriers are installed. The ESIA confirmed that effluent discharges will not have \n \n17 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n18 https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/tha-53239-001-eia. \n19 The project\u2019s 25% threshold value contribution to ambient air quality at sensitive receptors will not be met for nitrogen \ndioxide (1-hour average) when the plant is running 100% on diesel. The highest predicted nitrogen dioxide (1-hour \naverage) contribution will be between up to 25.49% and 26.53% of the ambient standard at the following sensitive \nreceptors: Nikhom Sang Ton Eng 9 School, Pasitharam Temple, Mab Yang Phon Temple, and Village No 7\u2013\u2013Ban \nWang Pla. However, the concentration of more than 25% is predicted to occur once in 3 years. Diesel will only be \nused temporarily as back-up fuel if gas is not available. \n ", "7 \n \nsignificant impacts on the receiving waters. Public consultation was undertaken by Gulf PD as \npart of the ESIA process in three phases. Public concerns and feedback, including mitigation \nmeasures for concerns raised by stakeholders, have been included in the ESIA and disclosed to \nthe public. \n \n25.  Social. The project is located in Rojana Rayong 2 Industrial Park and covers an area of \napproximately 492 rai (79 hectares). The ESIA and ADB due diligence found no legacy issues \nregarding the historical transfer of the project land. EGAT will construct the proposed transmission \nline.  The  proposed  alignment,  based  on  an  alternative  route  analysis,  avoids  physical \ndisplacement. An assessment of EGAT\u2019s right-of-way acquisition procedures was undertaken as \npart of due diligence. The land compensation (for the tower and the right of way) is based on \nmarket value and considers any losses during the construction and maintenance phases. Gulf \nPD  will  participate  in  EGAT\u2019s  ongoing  consultations  process  with  landowners  and  other \nstakeholders to address any concerns. The ESIA recorded no presence of distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous peoples or ethnic minority groups in the project\u2019s area of influence. The social due \ndiligence confirmed the same. \n \n26.  Gender and other social dimensions. The project is classified as having some gender \nelements. Gulf PD will provide at least 15% of total employment in the operation phase to women \nand implement the initiatives to prevent GBV during the construction phase. This will include (i) \nmaking zero tolerance policies and enforcing a code of conduct, (ii) having GBV signs across \nconstruction sites and labor camps, (iii) assigning focal points to deal with GBV issues, and (iv) \nmaking GBV training mandatory for all staff and contractors on site. Gulf PD will comply with \nnational labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures \nto comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.20 The client will report regularly \nto ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. \nInformation disclosure and consultation with affected people will follow ADB requirements.21 \nProgress on the agreed gender actions will be monitored during ADB staff supervision visits and \nlender\u2019s technical adviser visits, and will be included in the company\u2019s annual monitoring report. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n27.  Gulf PD was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
