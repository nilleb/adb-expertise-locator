However,  the  capacity  to \napply  sound  management  principles  and  practices  are  still \ndeficient,  particularly  in  view  of  increasing  devolution  of \nmanagement responsibilities to the provinces. \n \nThe  Project  will  address  institutional  and  capacity  building \nrequirements  (including  governance  improvements)  to  enable \nimproved management of the sector on a sustainable basis while \ncontributing to the Government\u2019s overall objectives of enhancing \nagricultural  productivity,  promoting  commercialization  of \nagriculture, and protecting the country\u2019s natural resources. Project \noutputs  comprise  (i)  capacity  built  in  sector  management, \n(ii) investment  in  resource  management  and  productivity \nenhancement, and (iii) an effective project management structure. \n \nRationale  The  Lao  PDR  has  abundant  natural  resources  and  a  small \npopulation, of which over 80% is dependent on agriculture for their \nlivelihood. Significant numbers of indigenous peoples from a wide \nrange of linguistic groups live in upland areas to the north and in \nthe southern part of the Lao PDR along the border with Viet Nam. \nThey  forge  their  predominantly  subsistence  livelihoods  from \nrotational cropping, which incorporates a heavy dependence on \nthe natural forest and water resources. The incidence of poverty in \nthese areas is over 60%, and is highest among ethnic groups. \n \n  The institutional and legal framework for sustainable and equitable \nmanagement of agriculture and natural resources (ANR) is weak. \nThis is evident in the ambiguity of policies and legislation, as well \nas  inadequate  professional  and  technically  trained  staff  and ", "ii   \nfacilities. At the provincial and district levels where most ANR \nmanagement decisions are taken, there is a deficit of expertise \nand  facilities.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  budgetary \nconstraints  (generally  sufficient  to  meet  staff  salaries,  but \ninsufficient for operational and development activities). \n \nThe capacity of the ANR sector to support traditional livelihoods is \ncoming under unprecedented pressure from the recent influx of \nforeign direct investment (FDI) and consequent granting of land \nconcessions. Allowing large-scale commercial development where \nthere is a weak regulatory and enforcement framework\u2014without \nadequate analysis of land capability and economic impact, and \nencouraged  by  land  speculation\u2014is  increasingly  resulting  in \nadverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  on  local  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  It  also  compromises  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \npreserve  the  country\u2019s  rich  and  diverse  forest  environs \n(deforestation  is  actually  increasing).  Adverse  impacts  on \necological  function  and  integrity  include  reduced  recharge  of \naquifers and storage capacity of reservoirs and reduction in dry \nseason  irrigation  areas  (directly  contributing  to  reduced \nagricultural production). Furthermore, the loss of forest, coupled \nwith the expansion of economic activities, is likely to result in a \npositive net emission of greenhouse gases with global impact. \n \nWhile trying to protect the natural resource base, the Government \nis  conscious  of  the  need  to  maximize  productivity  on  existing \narable land\u2014an area limited by topography, undeveloped water \nresources, and limited market access. Agricultural productivity is \nlow  by  the  standards  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations (ASEAN), and the recent achievement of broad national \nself-sufficiency in rice can only be maintained if the Government \ncontinues  to  improve  agricultural  productivity.  Food  insecurity \nremains common, especially in areas where the road network is \nunderdeveloped. \n \nSupport for proven interventions within an existing implementation \nframework,  which  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall \nsector development objectives and provide practical examples for \nthe  enhanced  capacity  of  agency  staff  to  manage  the \ndevelopment process, is therefore justified. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The project impact will be more efficient and sustainable natural \nresource  management  and  improved  sector  productivity.  The \nexpected outcome will be an enhanced institutional capacity at \nnational  and  provincial  levels  to  manage  natural  resource \nutilization in a sustainable manner, resulting in poverty reduction \nand  enhanced  market  linkages.  This  will  be  facilitated  by \ndeveloping a land capability database that describes land use and \nsuitability, making information regarding concession awards more \nwidely  available,  and  addressing  the  policy  for  protection  of \ntraditional  user  rights  (including  food  security).  Successful ", "  iii\ndevelopment initiatives from earlier projects will be consolidated in \nthe form of subprojects. National and provincial staff will apply \ntheir newly acquired skills by implementing subprojects to make \ninvestments more sustainable. \n \nThe implementation of subprojects will have a direct impact on \nagricultural  productivity,  as  well  as  improving  access  to  (and \nintegration with) regional markets and overall protection of the Lao \nPDR biodiversity and environment. Subprojects\u2019 selection criteria \nand design features will encourage poverty targeting, gender and \nethnic  groups\u2019  participation,  and  linkage  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) climate change and Greater Mekong \nSubregion  initiatives.  All  these  impacts  will  contribute  to \naddressing  the  persistent  threats  from  food  deficits  and  rural \npoverty. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $36.775 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.023 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  grant  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $20.0 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance 54.4% of the total project cost. The International Fund for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD)  will  provide  a  grant  of  $15.0 \nmillion to finance 40.8% of the total project cost. The Government \nwill  contribute  $1.775  million,  accounting  for  4.8%  of  the  total \nproject cost, to finance incremental staff salaries and taxes and \nduties. \n($\u2019000) \nSource  Total  Percent \n Asian Development Bank  20,000  54.4 \n IFAD Grant   15,000  40.8 \n Government of the Lao PDR  1,775  4.8 \n  Total  36,775  100.0 \n  ADF = Asian Development Fund, IFAD = International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Lao PDR has a high risk of debt distress, as approved by \nTerms  ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in September 2007, and qualifies to \nreceive 100% of its performance-based allocation of the Asian \nDevelopment Fund as a grant. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  June 2009\u2013December 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  June 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) \n   \nImplementation  A national project steering committee will be chaired by the vice \nArrangements  minister of MAF, with representation from the Ministry of Finance; \nMAF\u2019s Department of Planning (DOP), National Agricultural and \n ", "iv   \nForestry Extension Services and National Agriculture and Forestry \nResearch Institute; National Land Management Authority; Water \nResources and Environmental Administration; Ministry of Planning \nand Investment; and representatives from Attapeu, Champassak \nSalavane, Savannakhet, and Sekong. This will ensure interagency \ncoordination  and  provide  direction  to  the  project  coordination \noffice  (PCO).  At  the  provincial  level,  provincial  coordination \ncommittees  with  equivalent  representation  (including  district \ngovernors)  will  perform  similar  functions,  chaired  by  the  vice \ngovernor of the province. \n \nA PCO will be established within MAF\u2019s Department of Planning to \nattend to day-to-day management of the Project. In the provinces, \nit will be supported by a provincial project office (PPO) to be \nestablished in one of the existing line agencies to achieve the \nnecessary coordination of the contributing line agencies. \n \nThe PPO staff will work with district and kumban (village cluster) \nstaff to support their identification and prioritization of proposed \nsubproject  investments,  based  on  selection  criteria  specified. \nProposals  can  be  initiated  by  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or other entities working in \nrural development in the provinces. Proposals will be screened \nand prioritized by the provinces, then submitted to the national \nlevel  for  approval  after  ratification  by  a  technical  review \ncommittee. Implementation of subprojects will be the responsibility \nof the proposing entity, which will be contracted to the PCO and \nsupervised by the PPO. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \ngrant  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required at the national level to ensure \neffective implementation and at the provincial level to assume \nresponsibility for identification of potential subprojects and their \nimplementation.  Staff  will  also  be  needed  for  training  in \nsafeguards,  appraisal  techniques,  and  geographic  information \nsystems/information management. The Project will finance a total \nof 722 person-months of consulting services (84 person-months \ninternational  and  638  person-months  national).  The  level  of \nconsulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered \ncritical in view of the crucial gaps in capacity in the areas of \nappropriate  technology,  natural  resource  management, \ncommunity  mobilization,  and  subproject  focus  and \nimplementation. In addition, national consultants will be recruited \nto assist in feasibility studies and detailed design (including initial \nenvironmental  assessments,  resettlement  plan  preparation  and \nother safeguard requirements). The consultants will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  ", "  v\n   \n \nProject Benefits and  Capacity  building  activities  will  lead  to  improved  national  and \nBeneficiaries  provincial  capabilities  to  make  informed  decisions  about \ninvestment  in  the  sector  (public,  private,  and  foreign  direct \ninvestment);  and  will  enable  maximum  financial  and  economic \nbenefits to be derived from this external source of development \ncapital. As the scale of land concessions is large in relation to \nexisting crop areas and will only increase during the life of the \nProject, project benefits can be expected to be large in scale, \ngeographically dispersed, and affect all the rural population. \n \nBenefits from the subproject investments will include increased \nagricultural productivity from irrigation and support of technical \nextension services. Increased commercialization will result from \nrural road rehabilitation and strengthening the linkages between \nproducers and domestic/subregional markets. Economically viable \nsubprojects  will  contribute  to  local  and  national  food  security, \naddress  issues  of  climate  change,  and  promote  regional \nintegration. Overall, the integrity of the natural resource base will \nbe maintained and the process of managing competing interests \nin their use will be rationalized. \n \nThe number of beneficiaries will be substantial, as concession \nland areas affected comprise about half the total cropped area of \nthe provinces. The geographical dispersion of the subprojects and \ntargeting of investments in border areas mean that beneficiaries \nwill include the ethnic groups residing in upland areas. Women will \nalso be targeted beneficiaries. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main institutional risk to the Project lies in potential conflict \nbetween  relatively  autonomous  provinces  (that  have  enjoyed \nconsiderable latitude in the award of land concessions) and state \nagencies trying to standardize and rationalize the issuance of land \nconcessions (and prevent illegal issuance). This risk has been \nmitigated  by  involving  high-level  political  authority  from  the \nprovinces in the project design process, and obtaining widespread \ncommitment to reforming the land concessions\u2019 award system. \nGreater  clarity  in  land  allocation  processes  and  increased \npublication of land concessions awards reduce the governance \nrisks associated with large-scale land allocations. \n \nA second risk concerns the allocation of funds for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure rehabilitated under the \nProject. This is a systemic and ongoing issue, as cash-limited \nprovincial  authorities  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  state \nassets but receive few resources from the national budget to carry \nout  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  This  issue  has  been \nmitigated  by  (i)  requiring  provinces  in  which  subprojects  are \nlocated  to  sign  formal  commitments  to  meet  O&M  expenses, \n(ii) the  Government  providing  a  specific  assurance  that  it  will \n ", "vi   \nallocate sufficient funds for the same purpose, and (iii) ensuring \nthat subproject evaluations include norm-based estimates of O&M \nexpenses for different types of rural infrastructure.  \n \nIn addition to governance and sustainability issues, other risks \ninclude the following: (i) capacity development and training are \ninsufficient  to  improve  capacity,  resulting  in  weak  subproject \ndesign; and (ii) staff leave the Project or the ministry after capacity \ndevelopment.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  providing  adequate \ntechnical  support  and  by  supporting  performance-based \nincentives.  Measures  will  also  be  taken  to  ensure \ninstitutionalization  of  development  planning  and  administration \nthrough appropriate skills and partnerships. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Technical asisstance (TA) is required in view of the complexity of \nintroducing social and environmental safeguards into the process \nfor screening and approving investments in the sector. TA is also \nneeded because of the limited experience of provincial agencies \nto manage sector development as implementing agencies of an \ninternational  development  grant,  and  the  limited  technical \nexpertise  amongst  government  staff  to  ensure  that \nsocial/environmental  safeguards  and  other  social/gender  and \ndevelopment aspects are incorporated into sector management at \nall  levels  of  government.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a \nperiod of 24 months from April 2009 to March 2011. A total of \n42 person-months  of  consulting  services  (18  person-months \ninternational and 24 person-months national) will be required. All \nconsultants will be engaged directly by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  A  Japan  Special  Fund \ngrant in the amount of $0.7 million is proposed to ensure such \nsupport is provided. \n ", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nAsian Development Fund grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nSustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project, and (ii) the \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The report also describes the proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Sustainable  Natural  Resource  Management  and  Productivity \nEnhancement and if the Board approves the proposed grant and administration of the grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Lao PDR is a sparsely populated, mostly mountainous country, with limited arable \nland (estimated at about 10% of its total area). The population depends primarily on agriculture \n(estimated 80% of the labor force), contributing 42% of the gross domestic product, with rice \nfarming alone accounting for 39% of the agricultural gross domestic product.1 Sector growth \nrates were maintained at about 5% per year from 1996 to 2000, but slowed to about 3% per \nyear thereafter as restrictions on logging were introduced. Rice accounts for about 80% of the \ncultivated area\u2014comprising about 68,000 hectares (ha) of irrigated production, 620,000 ha of \nrain-fed paddies, and 108,000 ha of upland rice; collectively, these account for the bulk of \ndomestic food production. 2 \n \n3.  At the household level, food security is mainly women\u2019s responsibility. Livestock is a \nsignificant contributor to sector output as well as household incomes and nutrition. Growth in \nagricultural production has been impressive since the mid-1990s, partly stimulated by reforms \nsupported by ADB through two program loans and by a rapid expansion of the irrigated area3. \nFrom 1995 to 2005, rice production increased from 1.4 million tons to 2.4 million tons, enabling \nthe country to achieve broad national self-sufficiency in 2000. From 1992 to 2003, the incidence \nof poverty declined from 46% to 33%.4 Agriculture is central to both individual livelihoods and \nprovincial economies in the proposed project area\u2014covering 40 districts that constitute the \nprovinces of Attapeu, Champassak, Salavane, Savannakhet, and Sekong, and located in the \nsouth of the country.5 Of the total population of 1.96 million, rural poverty is high in half the \ndistricts.6 Within the \u201cpoor\u201d districts, 60% of the villages are considered poor (Supplementary \nAppendix A). The incidence of poverty is highest among upland ethnic groups. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  The agriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector is characterized by low levels of \nproductivity, poor agricultural and marketing skills, limited market access, low use of water \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Center. 2007. Statistical Yearbook 2006. Vientiane. \n2  Two crops of rice are grown on the country\u2019s 150,000 ha of irrigated land each year. \n3  ADB. 1989. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of Lao PDR for the Agriculture Program. Manila (Loan No. 0965-LAO), for $20,000,000, approved on \n10 July 1989; ADB. 1992. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed \nLoan to the Government of Lao PDR for the Second Agriculture Program.

Vientiane. \n5  The selection criteria is in the alternatives analysis of the detailed sector analysis (Supplementary Appendix A). \n6  Poverty is defined as being where a person cannot access the equivalent of 2,100 calories from foodstuffs or the \nequivalent of KN142,500 per month or less than $0.50 per day. ", "2     \nresources, limited access to technology, and little access to domestic capital for investment \n(Appendix  2). Weak  governance  and  deficiencies  in  the  state\u2019s  ability  to  achieve  planned \nobjectives are notable. The institutional framework for sustainable and equitable management of \nANR is weak, manifest in ambiguous policies and legislation, and inadequate strengths in \nprofessional and technically trained staff and facilities. At the provincial and district levels, where \nmost of the ANR management decisions are taken, there is a deficit of expertise and facilities. \nThe situation is exacerbated because of budgetary constraints (sufficient to meet staff salaries \nbut insufficient for operational and development activities). There is only limited formal credit for \nANR, forcing most farmers to depend on more expensive informal credit. While a few farmer \norganizations exist, farmer and water users associations are generally new, institutionally weak, \nunrepresentative of the poorest and of women, and generally inexperienced to undertake the \nfunctions they are intended to perform. Overall, the development opportunity is to address \ninstitutional  weakness  in  natural  resources  management  and  (simultaneously)  to  invest  in \nincreasing sector productivity. \n \n5.  The most obvious manifestation of this institutional weakness is in relation to natural \nresources management\u2014especially  land-use  management.  In  the  past  4\u20135  years,  growing \ndemand from neighboring countries for agricultural commodities has attracted investors to the \nLao PDR either through contract farming to source agricultural commodities for processing, or \nthrough externally financed direct investment in plantations (e.g., concessions for rubber, sugar, \ncassava, and trees for pulp) usually with foreign expertise. The country has seen a major \nincrease in foreign direct investment, which has resulted in unprecedented demand for large \nareas of agricultural and forest land. Concessions were being granted on long leases at very \nlow annual rentals ($5\u2013$10 per ha per year for 50 years was not uncommon), with no proper \nfinancial or economic appraisal and no social and environmental safeguards in place. In an \nattempt to contain this situation, the Government imposed a 1-year moratorium in May 2007 on \nthe  granting  of  concessions  in  excess  of  100  ha  by  provinces.  However,  the  lack  of \ntransparency of land transactions and inconsistencies in practice across provinces and between \nagencies has continued (despite the establishment of the National Land Management Authority \nunder  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office).  Overall,  the  land  issue  has  exposed  confusion  in \nadministrative and technical processes, and conflicts between the interests of the state in \nensuring sustainable patterns of land use to maximize growth and ensure its sustainability, and \n(relatively autonomous) provincial administrations. While FDI should have positive impacts\u2014in \nterms of capital, technology, and skills flows\u2014it is likely that many such investments will be \nenvironmentally  damaging  (through  short-term  exploitation  or  longer-term  neglect),  non-\ntransparent (mainly benefiting foreign and non-poor domestic interests and excluding women \nand ethnic groups), and economically sub-optimal (in terms of adding to domestic employment \nand incomes). \n \n6.  The security of smallholder tenure to and use of land and forest resources has an impact \non the type and variety of crops that households are willing to plant. Consequently, it affects the \npoverty status of communities and social equity (including gender and ethnic dimensions). \nThere is a need to define more clearly and formalize rights of land access and use. While most \nof the forest area is classified as production forest, conservation forests (or national biodiversity \nconservation areas) and protection forests are delineated on maps, but actual demarcation has \nyet to take place on the ground. This lack of physical demarcation compromises protection \npolicy  and  makes  these  areas  vulnerable  to  encroachment,  leading  to  deforestation  and \ndenudation. Over the past few decades, deforestation has been severe because of illegal \nlogging, shifting cultivation, and encroachment. This destruction not only represents the loss of \npotentially productive assets, but also results in increased emission of substantial quantities of \ncarbon dioxide. ", "    3\n \n7.  The other systemic ANR sector problem is low productivity. Factor productivity in the Lao \nPDR is low by the standards of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the \nrecent achievement of broad national self-sufficiency in rice can only be maintained if gains in \nagricultural productivity can be ensured. Poverty is highest in the more rugged upland areas \nwhere traditional shifting cultivation provides subsistence existence, complemented with the \nextraction  of  non-timber  forest  products.  There  is  a  need  to  address  food  insecurity  and \nmalnutrition, especially where the road network is underdeveloped. A move to more sustainable \nforms of agriculture in the upland environment (away from rice-based \u201cslash and burn\u201d systems) \nneeds to be complemented through potential development initiatives that can contribute to \nimproving the incomes of communities and households (mainly populated by ethnic groups). In \naddition, enhanced focus on improving productivity in the lowland environment (where the larger \nnumber of poor households is found) needs to ensure sustainable use of natural resources. In \nthe lowlands, there is also a fundamental need to promote ANR sector transition. This would \n(i) encourage  diversification  (into  new  crops  and  products,  e.g.,  niche  products,  livestock, \ncoffee); (ii) promote value addition (through improved on- and off-farm processing, better post-\nharvest technology, etc.); and (iii) support intensification (e.g., through new crop varieties) to \nraise yields. The challenge exists to integrate more remote and hitherto neglected communities \ninto the market economy with more commercial yet sustainable agricultural production systems. \n \n1.  Lessons \n8.  In 2005, a sector assistance program evaluation concluded that the contribution of ADB-\nfinanced  investment  projects  to  the  performance  of  the  ANR  sector  had  been  limited.  It \nrecommended that ADB activities in the ANR sector should be more selective and focused in \nterms of composition and spread, and should take into account government priorities, the \ndivision of roles and responsibilities among development partners, past performance of ADB \noperations, identified lessons, and ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and skills mix requirements. It \nalso recommended that the future approach should include using existing aid coordination \nchannels more effectively to (i) share experience and knowledge, (ii) find solutions to binding \nconstraints facing the ANR sector, and (iii) develop replicable approaches that can provide \ngreater benefits countrywide.7 These features are embedded in the project design. In addition, \nthe  experience  of  designing  the  Forest  Plantation  Development  Project  demonstrated  the \nimportance  of  working  within  existing  structures,  of  including  measures  to  improve  sector \ngovernance acceptable to policy makers, and of establishing a project scope that would prove \nfeasible to implement within the country context, to move the governance agenda forward.8 \n \n9.  Experience  gained  by  IFAD  has  demonstrated  that  rural  development  requires \ncoordinated  investment  in  several  sectors  to  have  a  significant  and  sustainable  poverty \nreduction  impact.  Among  the  main  lessons  from  past  IFAD  investments  are  (i)  focus  on \nstrengthening coordination of multisector interventions at the provincial level while developing \nthe implementation capacity of existing line agencies; (ii) promotion of decentralized decision-\nmaking processes of the government system to ensure institutional sustainability; (iii) building \ncapacity  at  the  grassroots  level  (villages  and  producer  associations)  as  it  represents  the \nfoundation of successful rural poverty reduction initiatives; (iv) prioritizing public investment in \nrural infrastructure targeted at upland and disadvantaged areas to reduce marginalization; and \n(v) establishing arrangements for operation and maintenance (O&M) and developing policy on \nbeneficiary contribution to rural infrastructure investments. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

The Government\u2019s guiding document is the Sixth National Socio Economic Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010).9 The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has translated its content \ninto specific targets and objectives outlining four overall objectives to be achieved through the \nimplementation of 13 measures (Appendix 3). The four strategic objectives for the sector are \n(i) increased  food  production  and  security10\u2014annual  food  production  equivalent  to  3.3 \nmillion tons of rice increasing national average consumption to 350 kilograms (kg) per head per \nyear (including poor districts) together with other targets for protein; (ii) increased production \nof  materials for agro-processing\u2014directed at domestic processing to allow agriculture and \nforestry exports to increase to 30% of the value of exports ($1 billion by 2010); (iii) stabilization \nof shifting cultivation\u2014the main strategy of poverty reduction in the 47 poorest districts, while \nproviding for environmental protection; and (iv) sustainable forest management\u2014to increase \nforest cover from 42% to 53% (12 million hectares by 2010) with commercial plantations. The \n13 measures  have  been  developed  to  give  effect  to  these  overall  objectives,  using  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget and donor support (Appendix 4).11 \n \n3.  ADB Strategy for the Lao PDR \n11.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2007\u20132011 aims to promote pro-poor, sustainable \ngrowth led by the private sector by improving policies and institutional capacity to support broad-\nbased,  private  sector-led  growth.12 It  proposes  to  support  building  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework and developing capacity in sectors and subsectors specifically identifying agriculture. \nThe strategy supports greater involvement of civil society and mass organizations in the delivery \nof  agriculture  and  basic  social  services.  Support  will  be  provided  to  private  business \nassociations to improve their ability to network, develop business skills, and advocate on behalf \nof their membership\u2014expanding livelihood opportunities for rural women as well as men in \ncommercial agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprise development. Previous ADB \nsupport  in  the  ANR  sector  has  been  catalytic  in  facilitating  private  sector  development, \ne.g., through  the  Northern  Region  Development  Strategy.13 ADB  supports  increased  donor \nharmonization within the framework of the Paris Declaration (and the Vientiane Declaration of \n2006) and participates in the Joint Working Group on Agriculture and Natural Resources, co-\nchaired by MAF. \n \n12.  IFAD was chosen as a co-financier, given the similarity of its goals and objectives to \nthose of ADB in agriculture and rural development and the complementarity of approaches in \nthe proposed southern provinces. IFAD\u2019s mandate is rural poverty reduction, and it has a record \nin community empowerment, improving the livelihoods of the poor, and investment in small-\nscale infrastructure. As donor assistance has tended to be scattered, diverse, and limited in the \nsouthern Lao PDR, the Government proposed that ADB collaborate with IFAD in a harmonized \nmanner. The Government will actively manage and coordinate activities, and ADB and IFAD \nunder  this  partnership  will  facilitate  further  harmonization  and  alignment  of  development \nplanning in the provinces to be covered under the Project. \n \n                                                 \n9  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.

Country Strategy and Program for Lao PDR (2007\u20132011). Manila. \n13 ADB. 2004. Northern Region Strategic Action Plan. Manila. ", "    5\n4.  Project Rationale \n13.  As FDI is likely to be the main source of investment in the sector in the immediate future \n(domestic capital formation is low, and ANR sector enterprises are predominantly small and \nmedium-sized enterprises), the Government has an interest in managing FDI to ensure that \npotentially beneficial aspects are realized and that harmful elements are avoided. In pursuit of \nfood security and developing smallholders\u2019 incomes, there is a need to strengthen the capacity \nof the respective line agencies to assess investment proposals, monitor and enforce approved \ninvestments\u2019  compliance  with  law  and  their  contractual  and  license  conditions,  and  not \ncompromise the integrity of natural resources. This can be accomplished through appropriate \nland suitability assessment, classification, zoning, and ground demarcation of various categories \nof forests and agricultural land. This is best facilitated by building capacities of the institutions \nconcerned at the provincial level, supported by enhanced capacity at the national level, in \nscreening and appraisal techniques that include economic feasibility, social acceptability, and \nenvironmental stability as formal approval requirements. Supporting associated investments in \nland-based public projects, upon which such processes can be applied, constructs a framework \nof \u201clearning by doing\u201d. It also ensures a direct impact on sector productivity as subproject \ninvestments will address a range of sector objectives (including agriculture commercialization, \nnatural resource protection, and food security). \n \n14.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020) for Lao PDR in promoting environmentally sustainable growth based on natural resources \nprotection.14 Economic  growth  will  be  inclusive,  as  resource  protection  disproportionately \nbenefits  the  poorest,  and  subproject  investment  selection  criteria  will  ensure  targeting  of \nbenefits. ADB\u2019s strategy focuses on two key drivers of change: (i) good governance, and (ii) \ncapacity development and formation of partnerships (e.g., with IFAD). Rural infrastructure also \nfigures significantly in project design, in accordance with one of ADB\u2019s core specializations. In \naddition,  the  Project  exploits  regional  integration  possibilities,  e.g.,  by  linking  with  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) based initiatives, including the East\u2013West Economic Corridor. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The project impact will be more efficient and sustainable natural resource management \nand higher sector productivity. The project outcome will be enhanced institutional capacity at \nnational and provincial levels to manage natural resource utilization in a sustainable manner. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Outputs \n16.  The Project will generate three main outputs: (i) capacity building for agriculture and \nnatural resource sector management, (ii) investment in resource management and productivity \nenhancement, and (iii) efficient project management. \n \n1.  Capacity Building for ANR Sector Management \n17.  Capacity building initiatives will target (i) land suitability assessment and participatory \nland use mapping, (ii) compliance with ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards and ADB\u2019s \nother  social  and  gender  development  aspects,  (iii)  investment  appraisal,  (iv)  producer \nassociation sustainability, and (v) policy development. An institutional needs assessment has \nbeen completed (Supplementary Appendix B). Prior to initiating capacity building activities, a \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "6     \nmore comprehensive capacity analysis and training needs assessment will be carried out at \nprovince and district levels. This will form the basis upon which capacity building efforts will \nperiodically be measured. Subcomponent 1(i) will build land suitability assessment, land-use \nclassification and zoning, and digital mapping skills in participating provincial agriculture and \nforestry offices (PAFOs) (where responsibility for ANR management and technical assessment \nof proposals for FDI and concessions has been delegated). This will require (i) provision of \ngeographic information system (GIS) equipment (hardware and software); (ii) training PAFO and \ndistrict staff in land suitability and participatory land-use mapping and social analysis of land \nrights and GIS and information management techniques; (iii) procurement of digital data sets to \nfacilitate  the  preparation  of  land  suitability  and  land-use  maps  at  district  level\u2014and \nsubsequently at subproject level, i.e., kumbans  and villages; and (iv) funds to operate a \nresource mapping facility including \u201cground truthing\u201d of interpreted data sets. This will provide \nthe  basic  information  and  equipment  to  enable  staff  to  present  technically  based \nrecommendations prior to the award of land concessions in the provinces, thereby improving \nland-use planning and natural resource management. \n \n18.  Subcomponent 1(ii) will be directed at associated provincial government line agencies \ninvolved in approving both public and private investment proposals; developing their capacities \nto  identify  financially,  technically,  socially,  and  economically  sound  investments;  and \nincorporating social and environmental safeguards and other social and gender development \naspects in their appraisal process.15 The subcomponent will provide international and national \nspecialists to train agency staff at provincial and district levels in safeguards requirements and \nimpact monitoring of approved subprojects. A project environment and social impact analysis \nmanual and other training material will be developed to help staff address social risks, related to \nensuring equity and maximizing benefits to poor households, women, and ethnic minorities; and \nenvironmental risks related to minimizing damage to the natural resources base. \n \n19.  Subcomponent  1(iii)  will  develop  investment  appraisal  techniques  (financial  and \neconomic analyses, including risk assessment) being undertaken at national level within MAF\u2019s \nDepartment of Planning (DOP). This national focus reflects the fact that investment proposals \ninvolving the allocation of more than 100 ha must be referred to national level agencies for their \ntechnical assessment. Additional capacity building will also be undertaken within provincial \nagencies to strengthen their appreciation of economic impact. This can be used in screening \ninvestment proposals involving allocation up to 100 ha and in prioritizing selected subprojects.  \n \n20.  Subcomponent 1(iv) will strengthen the capacity of producer associations to make them \nfinancially independent and sustainable in the longer term, and attractive partners to private \nsector investors to strengthen their capacity to negotiate mutually beneficial arrangements. The \nsubcomponent will provide support for development, operations, management, and monitoring \nof producer groups. This subcomponent recognizes the importance of supporting successful \ninitiatives, particularly where existing implementation management structures can be extended \nprior  to  project  completion,  e.g.,  in  the  case  of  support  for  existing  WUAs  under  the \nDecentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project.16 Resources will also be \nprovided to common agricultural interest groups seeking benefits from association, to assist in \nsustaining  their  operations.  A  training-needs  assessment  will  be  carried  out  and  training \ninstitutions  and  other  potential  service  providers  identified  in  the  first  year.  These  training \n                                                 \n15 Existing institutional structures include the provincial governors\u2019 office; PAFOs; department of communications, \ntransport, post and construction; departments of planning and investment; water resources and environmental \nadministration; social affairs; etc. \n16 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Decentralized Irrigation Development and Management \nSector Project. Manila. ", "    7\ninstitutions will work with the province level mass organizations, PAFO, district, and kumban \nextension staff to deliver technical skills training. Training will be provided for a minimum of 3 \nyears on a demand basis, and will include both technical areas and management functions \n(such  as  financial  management,  accounting,  bookkeeping,  and  estimating  beneficiary \ncontributions by group members). To qualify for assistance, each producer association will be \nrequired to demonstrate that at least 40% of its members represent poor households.  \n \n21.  Subcomponent 1(v) will enhance the capacity of MAF\u2019s policy development agencies to \nprepare policy alternatives for consideration by higher echelons of government, recognizing that \npolicy decisions are based on technical and political considerations. Assistance will allow the \nGovernment to address (i) modernization of agriculture in response to global consumption \ntrends that favor adopting bio-safety standards and clean-agriculture technologies based on \ngood agricultural practices; (ii) the development of mechanisms for internal control systems and \ntraceability  to  conform  with  sanitary  and  phyto-sanitary  measures  of  the  World  Trade \nOrganization; and (iii) overcoming technical barriers to trade, rules of origin, market access, and \ntrade  and  environment  regulations,  among  others.  This  subcomponent  will  also  assist  the \nGovernment to develop policy in areas related to land concessions (e.g., establishing a long-\nterm land valuation framework, and convening meetings with provinces to codify and confirm \nthe process of land concession awards), as it is currently reviewing those allocated within the \nsector.  Under  this  component,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  support  the  development  of \nlegislation to establish existing agricultural and WUAs as legal entities. The Government will \nsystematically  obtain  feedback  on  policies  that  reflect  the  critical  constraints  and  key \nopportunities available to local livelihood systems. The technical expertise proposed under the \nsubcomponent will respond to such challenges during implementation as required. \n \n2.  Investment in Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement \n22.  The capacity building activities in component 1 will have equipped decision-making \nagencies  with  the  skills  to  identify,  prioritize,  and  appraise  investments.  Applying  the \nstrengthened capacities, an associated program of subproject investments will be implemented. \nThese investments (beginning in year 2 of the Project, and once capacity building has begun) \nwill contribute to meeting the Government\u2019s overall objectives of the ANR sector\u2014food security \nand poverty reduction; sector transition (intensification, diversification, value addition) and rural \ncommercialization; and sustainability of natural resource utilization.17 \n \n23.  Small- and medium-sized subprojects identified for project financing will replicate or \nexpand  previously  implemented  development  initiatives  in  similar  agro-ecological  zones  to \nextend  or  widen  the  benefit  to  local  communities.  The  process  will  comprise  district \nidentification, provincial technical ratification and prioritization, and national review and approval, \nfollowed by provincial implementation and management. Evaluation of these publicly funded \ninvestments  will  require  an  appraisal  process  that  facilitates  incorporation  of  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards, in addition to technical and economic feasibility analyses. While food \nsecurity and poverty reduction will be the focus in the upland areas, to enhance overall food \nsecurity, the strategy in the lowlands will be to promote integration with regional markets and \nenhance smallholder participation in them.  \n \n24.  Subproject design will be carried out incorporating social and environmental safeguards \nand other social and gender development considerations. Subprojects will be formulated at the \ndistrict level, using demand-based procedures including a comprehensive needs assessment \nwith guidance from the provinces, specified by the Project. The target group for subproject \n                                                 \n17 This conforms with the four goals and 13 measures and the Government\u2019s 11 national programs and 111 focus \nprojects, included in its Sixth Five-Year National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010). \n ", "8     \ndesign includes (i) poor farming households in lowland areas that lack market opportunities, \nhave limited marketable surpluses, and lack secure land tenure; and (ii) poor farmers in upland \nareas whose livelihoods are threatened by insecure land tenure, limited agricultural land and \nawareness of their rights to forest products, lack of access to markets, and low levels of literacy. \nSpecific attention will ensure that design considerations cater to the priorities of ethnic groups \nand women. \n \n25.  To be eligible for funding under the Project, subprojects must be able to demonstrate \ntheir  contribution  to  the  Government\u2019s  sector  development  plans,  to  improving  agricultural \nproductivity, and to contribute to poverty reduction. They must also be technically sustainable, \nparticularly in respect of O&M for infrastructure; compliant with environmental regulations; and \nconform  to  regulatory  requirements  for  agriculture  and  commerce.  They  must  have  no \nsignificant  resettlement  or  land  compensation  implications  that  cannot  be  mitigated,  and \npotential beneficiaries must confirm the subproject as a priority investment following community \nconsultation. Subprojects that can exploit GMS features (including the East\u2013West Corridor and \nthe Biodiversity Conservation Initiative) and those that deal with climate change issues (and \ncould  access  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  and  the  Climate  Change  Fund)  will  be \nencouraged. Eligible subprojects will include rural infrastructure (rehabilitation of feeder roads, \naccess tracks, and construction/rehabilitation of small- and medium-scale irrigation); specific \npurpose extension initiatives; piloting grain storage; and handling equipment using advanced \npost-harvest handling technologies.18 Three categories of subprojects are anticipated: (i) those \ncontributing  primarily  to  commercialization  of  agriculture,  (ii)  those  contributing  to  poverty \nreduction, and (iii) those contributing primarily to natural resource management. To assure a \nbalance between these categories, a prioritized ranking mechanism is proposed (Appendix 5 \nand Supplementary Appendix C) to allow subproject proposals from each category to compete \nfor  funding  approval.  Subproject  proposals  to  be  implemented  in  priority  poor  districts \n(Supplementary Appendix D) will receive an additional weighting to elevate their priority in the \nselection process. \n \n3.  Project Management \n26.  The Project has a strong capacity building focus, which must be effectively managed at \nthe national level to ensure consistency of application. Similarly, the implementation of 6\u201313 \nsubprojects  in  each  province,  all  identified  using  bottom-up  procedures  with  possible \nmultiagency  implementation,  will  demand  a  high  level  of  project  management  skills.  The \ncomponent will provide technical support for this process while providing resources to establish \nand operate a management structure at both national and provincial levels. At national level, the \ncomponent will establish a small project coordination office (PCO) within MAF\u2019s DOP, providing \nresources to operate the facility with vehicles, equipment, and an operating budget as well as \ninternational and national training expertise. Provincial project offices (PPOs) will be provided \noffice equipment and vehicles, together with operating budgets and incremental national staff, to \nsupport project management and selection and screening of subprojects. \n \nC.  Special Features \n27.  One significant special feature of the Project is support to devolution of responsibility for \nmanagement of the country\u2019s natural resources to provincial and district levels. With devolution \nof land management to lower echelons of government, there is a need to enable local levels to \nmake decisions regarding land allocation. The incorporation of safeguard considerations in this \ndecision-making process is critical to the protection of livelihood sources for rural communities \nand maintaining the environmental integrity of the area. \n \n                                                 \n18 Potential subprojects might also include those contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. ", "    9\n28.  The Project is unique as it will develop provincial capacity to determine land suitability \nand  assess  the  impact  from  potential  investments,  as  well  as  initiate  public  disclosure  of \nconcessions awards. As part of this initiative, an assessment of existing concessions will be \ncarried out to prepare a detailed database of these concessions and post non-commercial terms \nof such information on a public website. In addition, commercial terms and conditions of such \nconcessions  will  be  recorded  in  a  confidential  database  for  monitoring  compliance  of  the \nconcessionaire  with  such  terms  and  conditions,  and  to  facilitate  administration  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitments in the concessions. \n \n29.  An important aspect in the selection of subprojects will be their key strategic impact, \nmaximized  through  rigorous  local  contextual  selection  and  design  processes.  As  multiple \nsubproject proposals are anticipated, a ranking mechanism is proposed to be applied in the \nprovinces prior to their submission for final approval at the central level. The process will enable \nsubprojects  with  different  technical  foci  and  cost  structures  to  be  compared,  allowing  for \nprioritization  of  investments.  Strategic  impact  on  subregional  integration  will  be  achieved \nthrough rural roads opening up border areas, and opportunities to access agriculture skills and \ntechnology from neighboring provinces in Viet Nam will be explored. \n \n30.  In facilitating effective implementation, the expertise of the Core Environment Program \nand Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative will be utilized for (i) transfer of skills and \ncapacity  building  activities  related  to  land-use  planning  approaches  and  related  spatial \nsurveying and analysis techniques; (ii) distillation of lessons and packaging of scalable impacts \nfrom pilot sites to other provinces targeted under this Project; (iii) provision of hands-on skills \ntraining  in  natural  resource  management  and  forest  and  ecosystem  restoration;  and  (iv) \nprovision of  planning and technical input for greening of the East\u2013West Economic Corridor.19 \n \nD.

Financing Plan \n32.  It is proposed that ADB provide a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $20 million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance 54.4% of the total project cost. IFAD will \nprovide  a  grant  of  $15  million  to finance  40.8%  of  the project  cost.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $1.775 million, accounting for 4.8%, to finance the total project cost, covering taxes \nand duties and salaries of seconded government staff (Table 2). The IFAD grant will be untied \nand will be administered by ADB following the Partial Administration Modality. Conditions and \narrangements for IFAD cofinancing, to be confirmed through a written endorsement from IFAD, \nwill be through a bilateral financing agreement to be negotiated between the Government and \nIFAD.

It will be responsible for (i) consolidating provincial annual \nworkplans and budgets into the project workplans and procurement plan for submission to the \nGovernment,  ADB,  and  IFAD  on  an  annual  basis;  (ii)  overall  reporting  of  implementation \nprogress to the Government and ADB and IFAD; (iii) financial management of the five advance \nproject accounts and the PCO project advance account as well as the two project imprest \naccounts; (iv) preparing and submitting withdrawal applications through the EA to the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) in a timely manner; (v) developing the training program and recruiting local \nconsultants  and  training  institutes  accordingly;  (vi)  procurement  and  management  of \nperformance-based  contracts  to  implement  subprojects;  (vii)  oversight  of  subproject \nimplementation; (viii) maintaining an efficient project performance monitoring system (PPMS); \nand (ix) providing secretariat services to the NPSC. The PCO will be guided by a NPSC chaired \nby a deputy minister of MAF; the vice chair will be elected from among the five participating vice \ngovernors appointed to the NPSC and rotated annually. It will comprise representatives from \nrelevant national agencies including MAF, National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute, \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service, MOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, \nNational Land Management Authority (NLMA) of the PCO, and WREA. The NPSC will meet \nbiannually  or  as  required  to  achieve  interagency  coordination  and  overall  implementation \nefficiency. \n \n35.  At  the  provincial  level,  PPOs  will  be  established  and  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation.20 The project office is to be established in one of the existing line agencies to \navoid incurring overhead costs for establishment of new offices. Staff appointments to PPOs will \ninclude a part full-time provincial project director assisted by a full-time implementation officer, \nadministration manager, accountant, and a secretary-cum-administration assistant. The staff will \nbe nominated from MAF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, and MOF in consultation with the \nprovincial governor. For day-to-day management, PPOs will respond to the PCO for reporting \nand  other  implementation  matters  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  awareness  raising  and \ndissemination of information about the Project; (ii) supervising subproject identification; (iii) \nsupporting  preparation  of  subproject  proposals;  (iv)  reviewing  and  approving  proposals  to \nproceed to feasibility study; (v) supporting preparation of feasibility studies, including safeguards \ncompliance analysis; (vi) reviewing feasibility studies, then prioritizing them for presentation to \nnational level; (vii) subproject implementation management; (viii) monitoring the impact from \nsubprojects; (ix) attending to progress and financial reporting requirements of the Project; and \n(x) secretarial services to the provincial coordination committees (PCCs). PPOs will be guided \nby PCCs to be established in participating provinces, chaired by the provincial vice governor \n(the provincial representative on NPSC). The composition of PCCs will mirror that of the NPSC, \nwith multisector representation. PCCs will meet on a quarterly basis or as required to provide \nguidance  on  overall  implementation  and  approve  the  prioritized  list  of  subprojects  for \nconsideration at national level. \n \n2.  Subproject Formulation, Identification, Prioritization, and Approval \n36.  The process of formulation, identification, prioritization, and approval of subprojects will \nensure that (i) subprojects reflect genuine stakeholder demand; (ii) access to grant funds is \nrigorously  screened;  and  (iii)  subprojects  have  sound  technical,  commercial,  social,  and \nenvironmental prospects. All processes will be carried out by existing institutional structures, \nsupported by project staff and TA provided under the Project. As a first step, campaigns will be \nconducted in all districts to create awareness of (i) the rules and guidelines for subproject \nformulation, (ii) the application process, (iii) screening criteria and the prioritization process, and \n                                                 \n20 In Attapeu, the provincial project office established for the IFAD-funded Rural Livelihoods Improvement Program \nwill be used as the PPO to reduce duplication of management structures.  \n ", "12    \n(iv) the implementation process. Support for the preparation of potential subproject proposals \nwill be encouraged from a range of stakeholders\u2014including districts, community organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  line  agencies,  existing  rural  development  projects,  or  rural \nbusiness and or community partnerships involved in agricultural development initiatives. The \nsupport for development of subprojects will be more intense in priority poor districts, including \nupland areas. Special awareness processes will be designed to ensure participation by all \ncommunities, including ethnic groups. \n \n37.  Guidelines to assist identification of candidate subprojects will be prepared by the PCO \nand  disseminated  widely  throughout  participating  provinces.  District  authorities  will  screen \ncandidate subprojects to ensure that each conforms to subproject eligibility criteria. PPO staff \nwill assist the district offices in this process. To become eligible for grant funding, subprojects \nmust (i) be consistent with national agricultural development strategies; (ii) be based on proven \ntechnical  parameters  and  implementation  arrangements  (either  within  the  participating \nprovinces or other areas of similar agro-ecological environs); (iii) have a significant potential \nimpact on poverty reduction (targeting poor households, ethnic groups, and women); (iv) be \nbased on a demonstrated demand; and (v) have the potential to be financially and institutionally \nsustainable.21 Non-eligibility  criteria  would  include  (i)  an  overlap  with  BCI  or  other  donor \nactivities aimed at ANR management, (ii) having adverse impacts on the environment that could \nnot easily be mitigated, and (iii) having significant resettlement implications. All subprojects \nwould be compliant with the safeguard policies of ADB, IFAD, and the Government.  \n \n38.  Candidate subprojects will be submitted to PPOs, where their conformity with project \ncriteria will be confirmed. Following this screening, subproject proposals will become eligible to \nreceive support for the preparation of a more detailed feasibility study. A full feasibility study for \neach candidate subproject will be carried out under the supervision of the PPO and by the \nrelevant line agencies, in close consultation with the sponsors, and assisted by project-funded \nTA as required. As subproject proposals will be diverse, a prioritizing mechanism is proposed to \nenable  comparison.  To  ensure  that  disadvantaged  (priority  poor)  districts  receive  due \nconsideration, a weighting will be applied in the case of poverty reduction category subprojects. \nPCOs  will  apply  these  criteria  to  candidate  subprojects  and  prepare  a  prioritized  list  of \nsubprojects for consideration by PCCs. After priority rankings have been confirmed by PCCs, \neligible subprojects will be submitted to the PCO for consideration. The prioritizing mechanism \nis in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n39.  The  PCO  will  confirm  the  prioritization  of  eligible  subprojects,  and  publish  these \nproposals for public comments. Following this disclosure, the proposals will be referred to a \nTechnical Review Committee that will (i) review and evaluate subproject feasibility studies, \n(ii) reject  or  seek  amendments  to  subprojects  as  appropriate,  and  (iii)  prepare  summary \ninvestment reports for consideration by the NPSC. Based on the provincial allocation of grant \nfunds to participating provinces, the NPSC will approve subprojects to be implemented and the \nPCO will advise the provinces accordingly. Grant funds will be allocated in accordance with the \ncosts detailed in approved subproject feasibility studies, and will be registered as committed \nfunds in the financial management information system. \n \n3.  Implementation \n40.  The proposed Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years from 1 June 2009 to \n30 June 2015 (Appendix 7). About 45 medium-to-large subprojects (each valued at $100,000\u2013\n                                                 \n21 There must be an identifiable and sufficient degree of \u201corganizational readiness\u201d to undertake the subproject in \nfinancial and institutional terms at least in a start-up phase. ", "   13\n$500,000). An additional 25 smaller subprojects (from $20,000 - $100,000) will also be financed. \nProvinces have little experience in identifying and designing subprojects, and responsibility for \nimplementation  will  be  spread  among  the  five  provinces.  Therefore,  capacity  building  and \nsubproject identification and design will take place within the first year. The detailed training \nprogram will be developed to meet the needs expressed in the approved subprojects. As \ntraining institutions are scarce, particularly at the province level, training will be bulked and \ncontracted at the national level. The subprojects are scheduled to be launched in the second \nyear of implementation. Where subprojects require extension services and agricultural research \ninputs,  local  extension  and  agricultural  research  agencies  will  be  contracted  to  the  extent \npossible. Where availability of services is limited, national service providers (public and private) \nwill be contracted to work with the local line agency to deliver services. Performance-based \ncontracts will be used to ensure that payments are made based on services rendered and \nincentives are in place for effective delivery. The final year of the Project will be spent ensuring \nthat arrangements are in place to sustain subproject initiatives after completion. \n \n4.  Procurement \n41.  A procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 8, with indicative contracts to be awarded \nbased on requirements of the Project. Prior and post review thresholds were discussed and \nagreed with the EA, and are included in the plan. Procurement will mainly be undertaken by the \nPCO. Goods and works financed by ADB and IFAD will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Packages for works valued at \nless than $1 million or equivalent but more than $100,000 or equivalent, shall be procured using \nnational competitive bidding using single-stage, two-envelope procedures. For works below \n$100,000 equivalent, shopping procedures may be used. Goods costing less than $500,000 \nequivalent but more than $100,000 shall be procured through national competitive bidding using \nsingle-stage,  one-envelope  procedures.  Smaller  packages  for  goods  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000  may  be  procured  through  shopping  procedures.  To  ensure  sustainability  and  to \nachieve the social objectives of the Project, procurement, specifications, and contract packaging \nof selected components may be adapted to involve local communities and nongovernment \norganizations, to use more local knowledge and materials, and to use labor-intensive and other \ntechnologies. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n42.  The Project will require three kinds of consulting services: (i) to assist the PCO with \nproject and financial management, subproject identification, and implementation; (ii) to assist \nthe PCO and PPOs in technical areas, including GIS, information management, financial and \neconomic appraisal techniques; and (iii) to provide policy development support. Consultants will \nbe recruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Project\u2019s \nprocurement plan (Appendix 8). Implementation management and technical consulting services \nwill be recruited through a consulting firm using QCBS (80:20) with full technical proposals. The \nPCO  will  recruit  national  consultants  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  for \nsubprojects  from  national  firms  using  consultant\u2019s  qualification  selection  (CQS)  with  the \nsimplified technical proposal. This method will be used since (i) few of the existing national \nconsultants are qualified, (ii) the quality of the firms\u2019 output will be critical to assessment and \nmitigation of the subproject\u2019s environmental and social impact, and (iii) recruitment time will be \ncritical.  The  PCO  will  also  be  responsible  for  recruiting  national  consultants  to  provide \nsupervision services for the implementation of approved subprojects. These consultants will be \nrecruited using CQS and the biodata technical proposal since they will be hired under small \npackages of $200,000 or less, recruitment time is critical, and the small size of contracts does \n ", "14    \nnot justify the preparation and evaluation of competitive proposals. To support implementation \nand capacity building initiatives, the Project will fund a total of 722 person-months of consulting \nservices (84 person-months international and 638 person-months national). Outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n43.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  To expedite disbursement, the Government will establish two first-generation imprest \naccounts22 at the Bank of the Lao PDR\u2014one for the ADB grant and the other for the IFAD \ngrant\u2014immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed by the Government, ADB and IFAD. These accounts will be \nmanaged by MOF. The maximum amount to be deposited in each of the imprest accounts will \nbe based on an estimated 6 months of project expenditure to be funded from the imprest \naccounts or a maximum of 10% of the ADB and IFAD grants, whichever is lower. Advance of \noperational costs to the PCO and PPOs will be based on approved work plans and budget \nschedules, and transferred to project advance accounts to be established at a commercial bank \nacceptable to the Government and ADB. Separate project advance accounts will be established \nfor the ADB grant proceeds and the IFAD grant proceeds. The advance accounts shall have an \ninitial advance, and the maximum ceiling is equivalent to 6 months of operating expenditures. \nThe advance accounts shall be opened with the equivalent of $50,000 for the PCO and $20,000 \nfor each of the five provincial advance accounts, and will be reimbursed using procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Liquidation and replenishment of the project advance accounts for the PCO \nwill be based on prior submission of full documentation to MOF through the EA (MAF). For the \nproject  advance  accounts  of  PPOs,  liquidation  and  replenishment  will  be  based  on  prior \nsubmission of full documentation to the PCO for endorsement before submitting to MOF through \nthe EA. The project advance accounts for IFAD grant proceeds will only be used for expenses \nrelated to supporting smallholder groups, including (i) training support to producer groups other \nthan the Decentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project WUAs (see \nAppendix  6,  Table  5.2);  and  (ii)  support  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation  Development  and \nManagement Sector Project WUAs. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures shall be used \nto reimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest accounts for all individual payments not \nexceeding the equivalent of $100,000. The grants will be disbursed by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the Government, \nADB and IFAD.  The funds flow chart is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n                                                 \n22 Bank charges related to operations of the imprest accounts and project advance accounts will be financed from the \ngrants. ", "   15\n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n45.  The PCO and each PPO will maintain records and accounts by financing source, and \nidentify expenditures incurred for the Project using grant proceeds and local financing sources. \nAccounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted \naccounting  standards.  Annual  project  accounts  of  the  PCO  and  PPOs  will  be  audited  by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. Audit coverage will include a special audit of project accounts, \nincluding separate opinions on (i) utilization of the imprest and project advance accounts; (ii) the \nstatement of expenditures, including whether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; \n(iii) whether the PCO and PPOs are operating the imprest and advance accounts in accordance \nwith ADB procedures; and (iv) compliance with financial covenants specified in the grant and \nproject agreements. Audit reports, management letter, and related financial statements will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or \nthe project closing date if earlier. ADB informed the Government of its policy on submission of \naudited accounts (covering failure of submitting audited accounts and financial statements by \nthe due date). Formal warning will be issued, and disbursements suspended, for accounts more \nthan 6 months overdue. \n \n46.  Each PPO will provide quarterly progress reports to the PCO. These will be consolidated \ninto quarterly reports and submitted to MAF, the NPSC, ADB, IFAD, and PCCs. These reports \nwill record progress made, problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or \nproposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and progress expected \nfor the following quarter. The PCO will ensure that these reports are submitted to ADB and IFAD \nin a timely manner. Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the PCO will submit \nto ADB and IFAD a project completion report that describes the physical progress of the Project, \nactual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, the results of capacity building activities, the \noutcome of safeguard efforts, a preliminary assessment of achieved benefits, and other relevant \nproject implementation matters requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n47.  The PPMS will in part be based on individual subprojects in accordance with a pre-\ndesigned framework for implementation and impact monitoring.23 Baseline data (disaggregated \nby gender and ethnicity) will be obtained during subproject preparation, and presented as part of \nthe subproject design and monitoring framework. A set of qualitative indicators to monitor \ncapacity development for the Project as a whole will also be developed.24 Capacity building will \nbe initially assessed through a baseline needs assessment, which will involve both an objective \nassessment  of  capacity  and  subjective  perceptions  of  staff  measures  through  periodically \nconducted  knowledge,  attitude  and  practice  surveys.  Implementation  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken  by  the  PPOs  and  PCO  as  part  of  their  normal  project  management \nresponsibilitiesand  in  line  with  their  overall  capacity.  Benefit  monitoring  will  be  undertaken \nperiodically (annually after year 2) through an independent contracted organization or institution. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants in Supplementary Appendix F (PCO adviser and \nnational M&E specialist) reflect this. Social and environmental compliance monitoring will be \nundertaken  by  an  independent  institution.  In  addition,  semiannual  project  reviews  will  be \nundertaken  and  a  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n                                                 \n23 The PPMS may be based on a three-level framework in which the first level refers to the regular and continuous \nmonitoring of activities and their immediate results (output reporting), the second level relates to the monitoring and \nassessment of project performance in achieving expected outcomes (outcome monitoring), and the third level refers \nto the assessment of project contribution toward the achievement of its overall goal (impact evaluation). \n24 Based on training evaluation techniques measuring understanding and application of techniques, practices, etc. \n ", "16    \n \n10.  Project Review \n48.  Apart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB,  IFAD  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive review within 12 months and annually following loan effectiveness when the first \nbatch of subprojects has been identified and is under implementation. A midterm review will also \nbe  undertaken  within  36  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  a \ncomprehensive assessment of project implementation arrangements, detailed analysis of the \nscope and implementation process and progress of subprojects, feedback from the PPMS, \nperformance  of  consultants,  capacity  building  progress,  and  possible  reallocation  of  loan \nproceeds. Remedial action will be instituted as required. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  Given the current high levels of investment in the agriculture sector (private domestic, \nFDI, and donor-funded initiatives), the proposed Project will develop national and provincial \ncapacities to manage this recent surge of investment. It is proposed that capacity development \nTA financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nwill provide resources for international and national specialists to develop training material and \nprovide on-the-job training as subprojects are screened, prioritized, and evaluated. Under the \nTA, staff from line agencies will be trained to ensure that social and environmental safeguards \ncompliance is incorporated into investment proposals, and to monitor adherence of approved \ninvestments with specified covenants. Details of the proposed TA are in Appendix 9. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Institutional Impact \n50.  The overall value of capacity building activities to the economy was not quantified, but \nimproved national and provincial capabilities to make informed decisions about investment in \nthe sector (public, private, and from FDI) will contribute significantly to the Government being \nable to take control of the land allocation process on a more rigorous basis. This will enable it to \nprotect the interests of smallholders whose livelihoods depend on the natural resources under \ntheir area of control. The increase in technical capacity will lead to considerable efficiencies \nwithin the future land allocation process by clearly identifying areas suitable for different forms of \nagricultural and forestry production, and demarcating areas set aside for protection\u2014while \nmaximizing economic rents for the state from land concessions. \n \nB.  Social Impact \n51.  An analysis of the project benefits indicates that the more significant social impacts \ncaused by the subprojects will be improved livelihoods and reduced levels of poverty for the \npopulation of the project area. Land suitability assessments and land use planning will enhance \nfarmers\u2019 awareness of suitability for various crops to maximize benefits, and facilitate land \nallocation and titling\u2014providing security of tenure and associated benefits. The provision of \nimproved  road  access  to  ethnic  minorities  and  farmers  living  in  isolated  and  inaccessible \nmountain areas is likely to have a positive impact, providing them with an outlet for their produce \nand access to lower priced household commodities, agricultural inputs, as well as health and \neducation facilities. The Project is classified category A for indigenous peoples, and an ethnic \ngroup development framework agreed in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The framework will help \nextend subproject positive impacts to ethnic groups and mitigate negative impacts, if any. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. A summary ethnic group ", "   17\ndevelopment framework is in Appendix 11 and a detailed ethnic group development framework \nis in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n52.  Improvement of rural access roads, irrigation facilities, and other rural infrastructure will \nbe within existing road alignments as much as possible. It is envisaged that irrigation facilities \nand other items of infrastructure will be rehabilitated in their current locations. Priority will be \ngiven to those subprojects that can avoid or minimize resettlement impacts. If any exist, they are \nexpected  to  be  insignificant  (category  B).  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared \n(Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix I) and sets out the resettlement policy, screening, \nand planning procedures that the Project will follow when preparing a resettlement plan if \nrequired. \n \n53.  Gender impacts will be facilitated through consultation with local women in the design of \nsubprojects and by their inclusion in project activities (including extension services and training). \nInfrastructure management bodies will include women. Gender training will be provided and \nlinked to this concrete action in subproject preparation. Gender focal points may be established \nin villages to promote improved agricultural practices, taking account of women\u2019s traditional \nrights in land reallocation and land titling (Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix J). More \ngenerally,  improved  road  access  will  open  up  new  opportunities  for  women  who  lived  in \npreviously isolated, rural communities\u2014giving better access to education and health services, \nas  well  as  facilitating  employment  and  investment  opportunities  (Appendix  13  and \nSupplementary Appendix J). \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n54.  The Project\u2019s primary focus is on capacity building for sustainable ANR management, \nwhich  entails  nonintrusive  initiatives  with  institutions.  The  developed  capacity  will  enhance \nenvironmental benefits and promote the environmental stability of subprojects. In examining \nland concessions, MAF and PAFOs will ensure that encroachment does not occur into protected \nareas and that any commercial ventures already allocated concessions in such areas will have \ntheir lease revised accordingly. Protection forest will also be clearly demarcated on land use \nand suitability maps to be prepared under the proposed Project. Based on the likely investments \nenvisaged, the Project has been classified environmental category B. An initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  for  the  Project  and  the  two  sample  subprojects  was  undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix K) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The IEEs \nshow that most of the potential impacts will be positive, that no significant adverse impacts are \nanticipated, and an environmental impact assessment is not required. However, to ensure that \nall potentially adverse impacts are mitigated, careful screening of subprojects will be carried out \nand  an  environmental  management  plan  specifying  mitigation  measures  and  funding \nrequirements will be a prerequisite for approval. In addition, an environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  has  been  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  K)  to  guide  the  EA  in \nundertaking environmental assessments of subprojects to be selected during implementation. \n \nD.  Economic Impact \n55.  Benefits from rural road rehabilitation include reduced travel costs and times. Indirect \nbenefits include the diversification of sources of income, higher levels of agricultural productivity, \ngreater  diversification  of  market-oriented  agriculture  crops,  improved  access  to  health  and \neducation services, and reduced costs of inputs and household commodities\u2014all leading to \nreduced  levels  of  poverty  among  communities  served  by  the  roads.  This  is  confirmed  by \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  estimates  of  23.5%  for  a  sample  rural  road  rehabilitation \nsubproject,  based  on  quantifiable  benefits.  The  benefit  of  irrigation  rehabilitation  includes \nincreased  agriculture  production  and  diversification  to  higher  value  crops.  The  sample \n ", "18    \nsubproject analyzed shows the intensification from a single rain-fed rice crop to two irrigated rice \ncrops, although other higher valued options are available with the more secure dry season \nwater  supplies  leading  to  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19.3%.  All  the  benefits \nanticipated are incremental in relation to the without-project scenario, where it may be expected \nthat  the  incidence  of  land-use  conflicts  increase,  social  and  environmental  consequences \nintensify, and suboptimal economic returns (to the state and public lands and to Lao labor) \nworsen. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nE.  Assumptions and Risks \n56.  The design logic of the Project assumes that inflows of FDI into the Lao PDR continue, \nthere is ongoing availability of appropriate improved agriculture technology upon which to base \nproductivity improvements, processes of increasing regional integration and market participation \nunderpin improving producer incentives, and the broad mix of government policies in the ANR \nsector remain consistent. \n \n57.  The  main  institutional  risk  to  the  Project  lies  in  potential  conflict  between  certain \nprovinces which have recently enjoyed considerable latitude in the award of land concessions \nand state agencies (such as NLMA) which are trying to standardize and rationalize the situation \nfrom  a  national  perspective.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  involving  high-level  political \nauthority from the provinces in the design process. A second risk concerns the allocation of \nfunds for O&M of rural infrastructure rehabilitated under the Project. This is a systemic and \nongoing issue, as cash-limited provincial authorities are responsible for maintenance of state \nassets but receive few resources from the national budget to carry out routine and periodic \nmaintenance. This will be mitigated by requiring provinces in which subprojects are located to \nsign formal commitments to provide financing to meet O&M expenses, and by the Government \nproviding a specific assurance that it will allocate sufficient funds for the same purpose. \n \n58.  A third risk is that capacity building initiatives are insufficient to achieve the competence \nneeded for improved natural resource management, particularly in land suitability identification. \nThis is mitigated by the continual input of technical specialists in the provinces throughout the \nfirst 3 years of implementation to provide the necessary support. The governance issue raised \nabove will determine if the technical recommendations are seriously considered in making land \nallocation decisions. \n \n59.  A final risk is that trained staff will leave their posts after receiving training under the \nProject.  This  remains  a  constant  threat  in  economies  where  skilled  individuals  are  few  in \nnumber and opportunities for advancement are plenty. The broader project benefit can be \nserved as long as the trained individual continues to serve economic development within the \nLao PDR and performance-based incentives are instituted. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n60.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MAF (the EA) have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funding. The Government will ensure that (a) counterpart funds in \nrespect of staff salaries within project management structures that are filled by \npermanent government employees will be made available in a timely manner to \nassure efficient implementation of the project activities, (b) additional counterpart \nfinancing  will  be  provided  for  any  shortfall  of  funds  or  cost  overruns,  (c) ", "   19\nexemption from taxes and duties on imported goods and equipment will be \nprovided in a timely manner, and (d) counterpart financing for compensation and \nentitlements under any resettlement plan required under any subproject will be \ndisbursed in a timely manner. \n(ii)  Operation and maintenance. Provinces in which subprojects are to be located \nwill  be  required  to  sign  commitments  that  they  are  prepared  to  meet  the \nidentified O&M expenditures. Failure of provinces to sign such commitments or \nto provide the O&M funds once subprojects are implemented will disqualify them \nfrom submitting future proposals.  \n(iii)  Environmental  safeguards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  its  laws  and \nregulations  governing  environmental  impact  assessments,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  are  followed.  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nrecipient's  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  then  ADB\u2019s \npolicy requirements will apply. The Government will ensure that MAF, following \nthe  relevant  government  internal  processes,  will  carry  out  environmental \nassessments for all subprojects prior to commencement of civil works. MAF will \nensure that the assessment will (a) meet the requirements of the environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  (b)  meet  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements, and (c) include details of local consultation carried out. MAF will \nensure that the IEE in a local language will be available on request at each of the \nPPOs for the public and other interested parties before the relevant subproject \nstarts.  MAF  will  ensure  that  specific  environmental  provisions  as  a  result  of \nenvironmental  assessment  are  included  in  civil  works  contracts  and \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  are  adequately  implemented  by  the \ncontractors. \n(iv)  Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way \nrequired for the Project will be made available in a timely manner and that \ncompensation at replacement cost and other entitlements will be provided prior to \nthe award of civil works contracts and prior to affected people being displaced \nfrom their houses, land, and assets. Any involuntary resettlement will be carried \nout in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed between MAF and \nADB,  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  on  resettlement,  and  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared \nwhere necessary following detailed design, and publicly disclosed, in places and \nusing language accessible to all affected people, prior to submission to ADB for \nits review and approval. They will be disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). MAF will also submit quarterly internal monitoring \nreports to ADB for uploading on ADB\u2019s website, in a manner and language \naccessible to all affected people. The Government will ensure that counterpart \nfunds for land acquisition and resettlement activities are made available in a \ntimely manner in accordance with the resettlement plans. \n(v)  Indigenous peoples. The Government through each provincial authority, will \nensure  that  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  specific \nmeasures  on  indigenous  peoples  set  forth  in  (a)  the  agreed  ethnic  group \ndevelopment plan and ethnic group development framework and resettlement \nframework,  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  (c)  the  laws  and \nregulations of the Lao PDR on indigenous peoples. In the case of any difference \nbetween the Lao PDR laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. \n(vi)  Grievance redress mechanisms. Within 6 months of the effective date, MAF \nwill prepare a proposal for a grievance redress mechanism acceptable to ADB, \n ", "20    \nand  establish  a  mechanism  at  MAF  to  receive  and  resolve  complaints  and \ngrievances relating to all matters relating to the Project including resettlement \nand the environment. \n(vii)  Project website. Within 6 months of the effective date, MAF will create a project \nwebsite as a part of it\u2019s existing website to disclose information about various \nmatters on the Project, including procurement. \n(viii)  Kumban  structures.  No  grant  funds  will  be  applied  to  the  construction  of \nkumban structures without prior approval of ADB and IFAD. \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness \n61.  The proposed grant will become effective only after the Government has filled staff \npositions identified in the project management structures with suitably qualified and experienced \npersonnel, approved by ADB and IFAD. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n62.  The following are conditions to be fulfilled prior to the disbursement of funds from the \nimprest accounts: \n \n(i)  project advance accounts will have been opened at national and provincial levels \nwith agreed limits acceptable to ADB and IFAD, and \n(ii)  PCO and PPO have been appointed and accounting and financial management \nsystems have been established to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \nVII.

", "Appendix 3  25\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Background \n1.  The economy of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is largely dependent \non an undeveloped and low-productivity agriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector to \nsupport the majority of its population. The proportion of households that can be described as \nagricultural remains high (at around 80%) and over 90% of these produce rice, mainly for their \nown consumption. Sector growth rates averaged almost 5% in the 5 years to 2000, but have \ndeclined since to about 2%\u20133% per year. This growth came mainly from yield increases in rice, \nbut also from modest moves toward higher value cropping in lowland areas. Agriculture has \nremained a relatively extensive activity compared with other countries in the region, but national \nrice yields are still low by regional standards. Input use is still about one-tenth that of most \ncountries in the region. National agricultural value added remains low, as is the openness of the \nsector (the lowest in the Greater Mekong Subregion). \n \n2.  The Lao PDR achieved national food self-sufficiency at the turn of the century. It is \nwidely agreed that aggregate annual production of rice, other grains and staples (roots, tubers, \netc.) on average meet national calorific requirements. However, the entire population does not \nenjoy secure food supplies. Seasonal and local deficits, especially in upland and remote areas, \nstill occur with some frequency. \n \n3.  As well as geographic (mountainous topography) conditions and particular subsector \nissues (such as the irrigated area as a proportion of total cropped area being low), the rural \neconomy remains broadly affected by specific deficiencies including (i) the availability of rural \nfinance, (ii) a generally underdeveloped private sector, and (iii) the poor state of the transport \nnetwork (especially roads\u2014both rural roads and links connecting the Lao PDR to other Greater \nMekong Subregion countries). Geographical isolation is a major cause of poverty, as much of \nthe rural population has limited access to markets, employment opportunities, or social services. \n \n4.  Overall, the economy is primarily agrarian and natural resource-based, despite abundant \nnatural resources and an apparently favorable policy climate that has facilitated economic \ngrowth at the national level. ANR sector transition (i.e., agricultural intensification, diversification, \nand agro-industrialization) has not yet occurred, and the sector\u2019s contribution to national poverty \nreduction has so far been modest. \n \n5.  In response to the Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010) and \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy objectives, the Ministry of Agriculture and \nForestry (MAF) has formulated four goals and 13 measures for the sector to guide development. \nHowever,  the  current  planning  system  does  not  embody  economic  prioritization  or  choice \nbetween alternatives (i.e., more robust policy making is required, especially at local levels). In \naddition, whatever objectives may exist in state plans, inadequate operational resources and \nsignificant  control  over  expenditures  by  provincial  authorities  (because  of  their  tax-raising \npowers) can frustrate and/or undermine state objectives. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the World Bank are working to put in place a medium-term expenditure framework at \nsectoral  and  national  levels.  It  is  questionable  whether  the  structure  of  MAF  operations \n(historically developed as an input and service provider across a range of activities) can meet \nthe  needs of  increasingly  export-oriented,  sophisticated, and  service-demanding  production \nsystems. \n \n6.  Although problems in governance conditions have been identified and described for \nmany years, the relatively poor sector governance is now an obvious constraint to the promotion \nof sustainable and equitable resource-based development. Agricultural growth has the potential \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nto benefit the majority of the poor directly. However, this growth (including in foreign direct \ninvestment [FDI]) depends on the\u2014currently absent\u2014transparency and predictability in the \nimplementation of investment laws, the enforcement of contracts, and management of the trade \nregime and taxation procedures. Similarly, farmers, agribusiness enterprises, and investors \nmust have confidence in relation to their land tenure and usufruct rights to ensure security of \ntheir property and investment. Such rights are largely unenforceable at present. Aggregate \nagricultural growth also depends on protecting national water, soil, and forest resources, e.g., by \ncontrolling the commercial and population-driven loss of forest, by managing the award of large-\nscale land concession, and other significant resource alienation. However, government capacity \nto monitor and regulate and to impose penalties for illegal acts is extremely modest. Changes \nrequired to increase the long-term sustainable sector growth rate will depend largely on the \noverall governance function, and how well domestic organizations and institutions perform. \n \nB.  Recent Developments and Current Issues \n7.  The most notable feature of the ANR sector is the unprecedented pace at which the \nsector  (and  thereby  the  country  itself)  is  being  integrated  with  neighboring  economies, \nparticularly through flows of FDI. This inward investment is manifest in (i) cross-border contract \nfarming arrangements (typically between Lao smallholders and Thai, Chinese, or Vietnamese \npurchasers,  traders  and  processors);  and  (ii)  plantation-style  commodity  production \nconcessions. Many of these involve Chinese (for rubber, mainly in the north), Vietnamese \n(mainly rubber and coffee in the south), Korean (Jotropha for bio-diesel fuel), and Indian (pulp \nand paper based on fast-growing wood fiber) companies. Many of the Chinese and Vietnamese \nagencies  are  State  Owned  Enterprises,  often  exploiting  historical  political  and  patronage \nlinkages with particular provinces. The scale of these developments is significant (153,000 \nhectares have been allocated in Savannakhet alone and total national land concessions may \nnumber  900  separate  agreements).  Concession  areas  in  the  southern  provinces  already \nrepresent 35% of the paddy area (Table A3). \n \nTable A3: Summary Statistics of Participating Provinces (ha) \nLand Use  Attapeu  Champassak  Salavan  Savannakhet  Sekong  Total \nProvince area  1,032,000  1,541,500  1,069,100  2,177,400  766,500  6,586,500 \nForest Area  965,343  1,126,081  914,540  1,896,123  733,793  5,635,881 \nUn-stocked  457,145  293,239  328,592  665,326  327,188  2,071,600 \nPaddy + Crops  34,386  317,657  130,377  199,341  22,029  703,790 \nPerennial Crops  350  125,016  58,373  0  19,017  202,755 \nNon Agriculturea  36,419  97,454  24,183  81,761  10,677  294,148 \nLand for Grazing  30,150  117,625  106,450  347,225  27,475  628,925 \nTotal Current Area  1,044,134  1,695,722  1,154,693  2,265,648  792,659  6,996,510 \nConcession Area  0  38,500  2,000  153,445  14,385  208,3301 \nMineral Exploration  2,400  160,133  22,360  196,128  137,440  518,461 \na Urban, water, barren rocky land, swamps, and grassland. \nSource: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Mines and Energy \n \n8.  Such concession investments have the potential to create large numbers of jobs for the \nlocal population; and can bring skills, technology, intellectual property, etc. to the Lao PDR. \nHowever, major concerns remain. Land is given to applicants for long lease periods. This is \noften done under provincial authority, the status of which is unclear, and whose administrative \nand  financial  processes  are  opaque.  Lease  periods  of  20,  30,  or  50  years  are  common. \nConcessions  are  frequently  given  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis  without  any  proper \nfeasibility or safeguards-based analysis. There is little consideration as to the economic impact \n                                                 \n1  Source: data provided by PAFOs. The Investment Division of the Planning Department in MAF estimate is 201,888 \nha.  \n ", "Appendix 3  27\non food security, local livelihoods, natural resources status, or the possibility that opportunities \nfor a more rewarding investment are excluded once land has been committed. In addition, \nannual  land  rentals  (typically  a  few  dollars  per  hectare)  are  extremely  low  in  light  of  the \nopportunity costs. \n \n9.  The Government\u2019s response to such arrangements is ambiguous. It involves confusion \nvis-\u00e0-vis legislation, and the mandates and authority of institutions; and outright conflict between \nthe  state  and  certain  provinces.  The  public  sector  response  can  best  be  described  as \nadministratively  and  technically  underdeveloped\u2014it  simply  does  not  have  the  capacity  to \nappraise and monitor such arrangements. The limited capacity of ANR institutions in this regard \nis the core sector problem and desired outcome to remedy this situation. Without the Project, \nthe nature of many such investments could be (i) environmentally damaging, either through \nrelatively short-term exploitation or longer-term neglect; (ii) non-transparent, thus benefiting \nforeign and nonpoor interests; and (iii) economically suboptimal, in terms of adding to domestic \nemployment, income-generation, and wealth-creation. \n \n10.  There are also concerns from the impact of major international price changes (rice - \ndoubling between early 2007 and early 2008) and to fuel-based inputs (inorganic fertilizers, \npesticides, herbicides, etc.). These changes have affected the dynamics of rice production and \nconsumption in ways that remain unclear, as the rice economy is characterized by a complex \ninterplay of production and consumption factors. At the policy level, a proper understanding is \nrequired of (i) the extent to which rice production should be promoted (in aggregate and at \nspecific locations), and (ii) the opportunity costs of any particular level of national food security. \nPerhaps even more urgently, at the investment level, specific interventions are needed to \nincrease the productivity of rice and other staples. This may be achieved through replication of \nsuccessful irrigation rehabilitation schemes; and promotion and formation of farmer groups (to \nimprove post-harvest handling, undertake marketing, devolve scheme management, etc.). \n \n11.  Recent FDI and land-based investments from neighboring countries in the ANR sector \nmay be seen as a gold rush. However, as the economy becomes more formally integrated into \nworldwide relationships in the longer term, it will be more affected by global (as opposed to \nmerely local and regional) factors. These will include the effects of engaging new and higher \nvalue  products,  intensifying  and  extending  supply  chains,  more  rigorous  quality  standards, \nbetter information, etc. There is an urgent need to strengthen Lao PDR value chains, add value \nto  existing  products,  and  encourage  product  diversification  through  specific  investments  to \naddress and exploit such possibilities. At a policy level, another need is to improve the Lao \nPDR\u2019s ability to engage in global (World Trade Organization) and regional (e.g., Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations [ASEAN], ASEAN Free Trade Area, and ANR trade based on proper \nsanitary and phyto-sanitary measures. \n \n12.  Overall, securing the natural resource base is a necessary but insufficient condition for \nANR  sector  development.  Complementary  investments  must  raise  sector  productivity  on  a \nsustainable and equitable basis. \n \n13.  The project design is based on identified sector problems. It has incorporated lessons \nfrom previous interventions by taking a strategic approach, focusing on binding constraints, and \nmaximizing  donor  coordination.  It  integrates  with  other  ADB  interventions,  e.g.,  in  public \nexpenditure management and national and sector trade facilitation. A sector lending modality is \nrequired because it is necessary to (i) address sector capacity needs centered on the land \nissues; and (ii) promote increased ANR productivity and natural resource management at a \nrange of specific locations, with a variety of sector objectives (poverty reduction, food security, \ntrade promotion, etc.). The subproject identification and selection processes will ensure that \ninclusive economic growth is fostered. \n ", " \nONGOING EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR  2\n8\n   \nExecuting \nProject  Duration  Funded by  Objectives  Area  A\nAgency  p\np\ne\nn\nNam Ha Watershed Poverty  Ministry of  Jul 2005\u2013 Asian  Community development and  Nine villages of Viengphoukha  d\nix\nReduction Project  Agriculture and  Jul 2009  Development Bank  sustainable land use management  district, Luang Namtha   4\nForestry (MAF)  (ADB)   \n$1.5 million \nLong Alternative Development  NCA (Norwegian  2004\u2013 Norwegian  To reduce opium plantation and  40 villages in Long district, \nProject  Church Aid)  2009  Ministry of Foreign  drugs by improving education,  Luang Namtha \nAffairs (MFA)   Public health, agriculture, crop \n  production, livestock, rice cattle and \nvaccine banks, community training \nNam Chouam and Meung  Bokeo Provincial  2004\u2013 NCA  Develop education; public health;  Meung and Nam Chouam Area \nRural Development Project  Agriculture and  2009    agriculture, including crop  district, Bokeo \nForestry Office  production, livestock (cattle and \nbuffalo), the establishment of rice, \ncattle and vaccine banks; and \ncommunity development training \nLao-America Cooperation  MAF  Dec  USAID  Eradication of opium plantation and  Ngoy and Viengkham districts, \nProject for Opium Free Areas  2004\u2013Dec  $4 million  addiction through integrated rural  Luang Prabang \n2009  development activities \nNorthern Community Managed  Department of  2005\u2013  ADB  Reduce rural poverty in 11 districts  Northern provinces of Lao \nIrrigation Project  Irrigation, MAF  2011  $10 million  of the northern region through  PDR: Houaphanh, Xieng \nsustained growth of agricultural  Khouang, Luang Prabang, and \nproduction, by developing  Xaysomboun Special Zone \ncommunity-managed irrigation \nschemes with strong community \nownership \nAquaculture Improvement and  Department of  2005\u2013  JICA  Extension of aquaculture suitable for  5 provinces: Oudomxay, \nExtension Project Ph II  Livestock and  2010  Y12,000,000 per  local conditions is started in the  Sayabouli, Savanakhet, \nFisheries, MAF  year.  target provinces  Saravan, and Vientiane \nprovince \nNam Ngum River Basin  Water Resources  2003-\u2013 ADB $15 million  Enhance government capability to  Vientiane province, \nDevelopment Project  Coordination  2009  with $3.5 million  manage natural resources,  Xaysomboun Special Region, \nCommittee, Prime  grant from French  especially in the water sector  and Xieng Khuang \nMinister\u2019s Office  Development \nAgency (AFD) \n ", " \nExecuting \nProject  Duration  Funded by  Objectives  Area \nAgency \nProgram for National Strategy  MAF  2007 \u2013  AFD  Support to MAF for the elaboration  National \nin Conservation Agriculture  2010  \u20ac1.25 million  of a national strategy for \nconservation agriculture \nProgram for National Strategy  MAF (Dept of  2007 \u2013 AFD  Support to the elaboration of the  Institutional/Vientiane \nin Irrigation  Irrigation)  2009  \u20ac1 million  national policy for irrigation \nLao Economic Acceleration  Provincial  2000 \u2013  USAID  Vocational women development.

Subproject Identification \n1.  The format of proposals will be outlined as developed by the project coordination office \n(PCO). Provincial project offices (PPOs) will conduct public awareness campaigns to elicit \nsubproject proposals. These public awareness campaigns include meetings, workshops, radio, \nflyers, and other types of media to reach the broader rural community. They will disseminate \ninformation such as a general description of potential subprojects, with details of eligibility \ncriteria and subproject value limits ($100,000\u2013$500,000), and a subset of smaller subprojects \nvalue limits ($20,000\u2013$100,000) and criteria to be used in prioritizing proposals, as well as \napplication  and  processing  procedures.  PPOs  will  ensure  that  awareness  campaigns  are \nconducted in a form, manner, and language that enables them to be understood by ethnic \ngroups, women, and other vulnerable groups within rural communities\u2014particularly in priority \npoor districts and upland areas. \n \nB.  Candidate Subproject Proposals \n2.  The  first  step  will  be  to  identify  subproject  proposals  that  can  be  developed  into \ncandidate subprojects by the district authorities. This will enable initial screening of proposals at \nthe district level so that certain subproject proposals can be developed further into feasibility \nstudies. Each year, the provincial vice governor will issue a call for proposals from interested \ncandidates working in rural development. The PCO will specify a format in which subproject \nproposals should be submitted, and candidate proposals will need to be submitted to the district \ngovernor\u2019s office in that format. This format would include at least (i) proponent contact details \nwith summary credentials; (ii) an outline of scope and coverage of the subproject; (iii) an outline \nof summary costs; (iv) identification of main benefits and beneficiaries; and (v) an indication of \nwhether there was any particular social (e.g., particularly benefiting disadvantaged or remote \nethnic communities) or environmental issues associated with the subproject.  \n \n3.  Candidate proposals that also demonstrate the following will be prioritized: (i) links to \nongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  initiatives  or  proposals  (e.g.,  the  subproject \nproduces outputs that are traded across borders, access the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, \nand benefit from GMS customs harmonization procedures; or involve technology transfer and/or \nskills enhancement from a neighboring GMS country); or (ii) the potential for positive climate \nchange  impacts  (ideally  being  eligible  for  support  under  schemes  such  as  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism or the Asian Development Bank [ADB] Climate Change Fund). There \nare  three  expected  categories  of  subprojects:  (i)  those  contributing  primarily  to \ncommercialization  of  agriculture,  (ii)  those  contributing  to  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii)  those \ncontributing primarily to resource management. To ensure that the Project supports balanced \nrepresentation among these categories, a ranking mechanism that relies on weighting various \ncriteria to prioritize subprojects among these categories will be developed. This will be based on \nthe proposed ranking mechanism below (paras. 13\u201316), to allow subproject proposals from \neach category to compete for funding approval. Subproject proposals to be implemented in \npriority poor districts will receive additional weighting to elevate their priority in the selection \nprocess. \n \n4.  Candidate proposals received at district level will be referred to PPOs. Assisted by \ntechnical assistance consultants recruited to support provincial management of the Project, \nPPOs will screen subprojects for eligibility in accordance with the following criteria:  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \n(i)  The subproject has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater \nthan 10%\u201312%. \n(ii)  The subproject conforms to the recipient\u2019s Sixth National Socio Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010)1 and provincial agricultural development \nstrategies acceptable to the recipient and ADB. \n(iii)  The subproject will be an agriculture project based on proven technical \nparameters and implementation arrangements within the province or in a \nlocation with a similar agricultural and ecological environment for the \nbenefit of smallholders.  \n(iv)  The  subproject  will  be  identified  and  prioritized  based  on  the  needs \nassessment and any updates thereto, and will be further selected and \ndesigned  taking  beneficiary  and  affected  person  consultations  into \naccount.  \n(v)  The  subproject  reflects  the  requirement  for  a  reasonable  balance  of \nactivities among communities and districts. \n(vi)  The  subproject  will  have  a  significant  potential  impact  on  poverty \nreduction; and target poor districts, poor households, ethnic groups, and \nwomen. \n(vii)  The subproject plans have been published in a form, manner, and place \nthat makes them available to affected people; public comments have \nbeen invited; and comments, including objections, have been published. \n(viii)  The subproject must be technically feasible and represent the least-cost \nalternative, taking into account the need to provide for a reasonable \nincrease in demand in the future.  \n(ix)  The subproject is to be conducted within an institutional framework that \ndemonstrates the likelihood that it will be financially and institutionally \nsustainable, including operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n(x)  The equipment, materials, and other resources can be acquired in, or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction \nor delay.  \n(xi)  The  subproject  can  be  completed  within  the  project  implementation \nperiod.  \n(xii)  The subproject is in compliance with the laws of the recipient, including \nits environmental requirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), ADB\u2019s \nforest  policy,2 and  the  environmental  requirements  set  forth  in  the \nenvironment  assessment  and  review  framework  (Supplementary \nAppendix K). For subprojects that require an environmental assessment, \nit  is  included  in  the  subproject  proposal,  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental clearance is obtained prior to the award of the subproject \ncontract.  \n(xiii)  The  subproject  will  involve  minimal  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement. If either of these is required for a subproject, it will be \nconducted  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995) and the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I) \n(xiv)  The subproject complies with ADB's Policy on Idigenous Peoples (1998) \nand the conditions set forth in the ethnic group development framework \n(Supplementary Appendix H). \n                                                 \n1 Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.

Once these criteria have been confirmed by PPOs, subprojects will become eligible to \nreceive support for the preparation of a more detailed feasibility study. PPOs will report the \noutcome to proponents, with a copy to the district governor\u2019s office, and if a subproject is \nrejected, they will state the reasons for rejection, to provide a learning process and enhance \ntransparency. Initial screening by PPOs should be completed within 1 month of receipt of \nproposals. \n \n6.  A  full  feasibility  study  for  each  candidate  subproject  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nsupervision of the PPO and by relevant line agencies, in close consultation with sponsors and \nproposers, assisted by project\u2013funded technical assistance as required. The PCO will develop \nstandard requirements for the detailed feasibility study that are acceptable to ADB and will \ninform PPOs of these requirements. The PCO should also address all compulsory and scored \ncriteria outlined below (paras.13\u201316) to facilitate comparison between projects of a different \ncategory. They will include clear identification of the O&M expenditures necessary to sustain \neconomic benefits. Completed feasibility studies will be submitted to the relevant PPO for \nprioritizing, using the prescribed criteria and ranking system. \n \nC.  Eligible Subproject Proposals \n7.  The prioritization of candidate subprojects into eligible subprojects for submission to the \nnational level will be undertaken in accordance with the ranking mechanism below.  \n \n8.  All technical and financial estimates used in the feasibility studies should be ratified by \nqualified personnel available within the province. Based on the adjusted weightings assigned to \neach candidate subproject feasibility study (paras.13\u201316 below), a summary  report will be \nsubmitted to the provincial coordination committee for consideration. Those recommended by \nthe provincial coordination committee shall be forwarded to the PCO while those rejected will be \nreturned to the proponent with an explanation of the reasons behind the decision. \n \n9.  The PCO shall refer the feasibility studies to a technical review committee to confirm the \ntechnical basis for the subprojects. The technical review committee will comprise experts from \nrelevant ministries and departments, including but not limited to Agriculture and Forestry and its \nvarious departments, Water Resources and Environment Administration, Commerce and Trade, \nCommunication,  Transport  Post  and  Construction,  etc.  Others  may  be  co-opted  from  the \nGovernment or private sector as required. After receiving technical confirmation, the PCO shall \nrefer eligible subprojects to the national project steering committee (NPSC) for approval and \nfunding commitment.  \n \n10.  Because  of  the  importance  of  adequately  maintaining  rural  infrastructure  to  sustain \nbenefit  flows,  provinces  in  which  subprojects  are  to  be  located  will  be  required  to  sign \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \ncommitments that they are prepared to meet the identified O&M expenditures with matching \ngrants from the Project under a well-defined institutional and financial recovery arrangement. \nFailure of provinces to sign such commitments or to provide the O&M funds once subprojects \nare implemented will disqualify them from submitting future proposals.   \n \n11.  A works and service contract will then be developed by the PCO in cooperation with the \nrelevant national agency, depending on the nature of the approved subproject. This contract will \nspecify  the  time  frame,  financing,  benchmarks,  disbursement  schedule,  and  reporting \nrequirements for each subproject. Failure by the contractor or service provider to adhere to the \nagreement will lead to suspension of financing. In the first 2 years, subprojects will be required \nto obtain no objections from ADB and the International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD). \n \nD.  Prioritization Mechanism \n12.  Apart from the criteria used in the screening process, additional criteria will be used to \nfacilitate the prioritization of subprojects given their different objectives and outcomes. A score- \nbased system will be adopted for the three categories of subprojects: (i) rural poverty-focused \nsubprojects,  (ii)  rural  commercialization-based  subprojects,  and  (iii)  natural  resource \nmanagement-based  projects.  Different  weightings  will  be  applied  to  the  different  types  of \nsubprojects to facilitate this prioritization process.  \n \n1.  Rural Poverty Reduction Subprojects \n13.  For rural poverty reduction subprojects, the indicators shall have the following weights: \n(i) A = the EIRR (10%); (ii) B = the number of individuals below the established poverty line \nassisted per $1,000 invested (40%); (iii) C = the equity contribution of beneficiaries (10%); and \n(iv) D = the district is considered poor (40%). The first criterion is an indication of economic \nviability, the second an indicator of project impact and efficiency of impact (particularly on \npoverty  reduction),  the  third  is  an  indicator  of  ownership  by  subproject  proponents  or \nbeneficiaries, and the fourth is to ensure prioritization of proposals from priority poor/upland \ndistricts.  \n \n14.  The highest data for each of the evaluation criteria from the subprojects being evaluated \nwill be given a rating of 1.00 point. The scores for evaluation criteria of the other proposals will \nbe computed accordingly as a ratio to the highest score. Proposals will be ranked according to \ntheir combined scores using the formula below: \n \nI = (0.10\u00d7A) + (0.40\u00d7B) + (0.10\u00d7C) + (0.40\u00d7D) \n \n2.  Rural Commercialization Subprojects \n15.  For rural commercialization subprojects, the criteria indicators shall have the following \nweights: (i) A = the EIRR (60%); (ii) B = the number of individuals below the established poverty \nline assisted per $1,000 invested, excluding labor in kind (15%); (iii) C = the equity contribution \nof beneficiaries (25%). Proposals will be ranked according to their combined scores using the \nfollowing formula: \n \nI = (0.60\u00d7A) + (0.15\u00d7B) + (0.25\u00d7C) \n \n ", "Appendix 5  35\n3.  Natural Resources Management Subprojects \n16.  For natural resources management subprojects, an additional indicator is needed to \nquantify the degree of threat to the resource. This will be calculated on a score of 1\u20135, with \n1 being a low level of threat, and 5 being an extreme and immediate threat to the resource. The \ndegree of threat will be confirmed by an environmental specialist during the feasibility study, and \nconfirmed at later stages of assessment. An extreme and immediate threat would mean that the \nproposal  is  more  deserving  of  an  investment  to  mitigate  the  threat.  For  natural  resource \nmanagement subprojects, the criteria indicators shall have the following weights: (i) A = the \nEIRR (25%); (ii) B = the number of individuals below the established poverty line assisted per \n$1,000 invested (25%); (iii) C = the equity contribution of beneficiaries (25%); and (iv) D = the \ndegree of threat (25%). Proposals will be ranked according to their combined scores using the \nfollowing formula: \n \nI = (0.25\u00d7A) + (0.25\u00d7B) + (0.25\u00d7C) + (0.25\u00d7D) \n \nE.  Provincial Grant Allocations \n17.  The allocation of grant funds between provinces for the implementation of subprojects is \nproposed to be made through an initial equal allocation of $2 million to each of the provinces, \nand can be supplemented by a proportional allocation based on the number of poor households \nwithin the project area. This will ensure that the upland and resource poor provinces have the \nopportunity  to  receive an  allocation  based  on  the  incidence  of  poverty.  This  constitutes  a \nde facto measure for poverty targeting, but also provides a fair means for allocation among the \nprovinces with their diverse capital base. Allocation of grant funds among potential subprojects \nin accordance with their orientation (poverty reduction, commercialization, or natural resource \nmanagement)  will  be  addressed  through  the  assignment  of  weightings  in  the  prioritization \nprocess  mentioned  above  (paras.  13\u201316).  Progress  will  be  evaluated  after  1  year,  and \nsubsequent allocation will be made based on performance vis-\u00e0-vis predetermined indicators. \n \nTable A5: A possible Proposed Allocation of Subproject Funds between Provinces \n \nProvince  Population  # of Poor  % Poor  Initial  Supplementary  Totala \n(000)  (000)  Allocation  Allocation   \n  ($ '000)  ($ \u2019000)  ($ \u2019000) \nAttapeu  100.7  45.6  6.8  2,000  554.1  2,554.1 \nChampassak  552.0  196.7  29.4  2,000  2,390.3  4,390.3 \nSalavane  287.9  113.9  17.0  2,000  1,3841.1  3,384.1 \nSavannakhet  755.8  280.0  41.8  2,000  3,402.6  5,402.6 \nSekong  72.0  32.9  4.9  2,000  399.8  2,399.8 \nTotal  1,768.4  669.1  100  10,000  8,131.0  18,131.0 \na  Only the budget for subprojects is used for allocation purpose. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", " \nSUMMARY COST ESTIMATES  3\n6\n   \nTable A.6.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \nA\n(Kip million)  p\np\n  e\nn\nItem     Kip Million  $ '000  % Total Base  dix\n   Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  Costs   6\n \n A.

Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  The anticipated outcome of the attached capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nis as follows: (i) increased awareness of the importance of social and environmental safeguards \nwhen allocating natural resources for investment proposals; (ii) subprojects implemented that \nincorporate safeguards to improve beneficiary ownership of subprojects; (iii) a comprehensive \nset of training material for use in subsequent agency training throughout the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; and (iv) a database comprising all the relevant geographic information \nsystem (GIS) data, maps at various scales, and data pertaining to safeguards compliance \navailable at the national, provincial, and district levels. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n2.  Given the current high levels of investment in the agriculture sector (private domestic, \nforeign direct investment, and donor-funded initiatives), the Project will develop national and \nprovincial capacities to manage this recent surge of investment, ensuring that full benefits are \nachieved and detrimental impacts minimized. There is increased recognition of the need to \nincorporate  social  and  environmental  safeguards  and  other  social  and  gender  compliance \nmeasures when preparing and implementing rural development projects. While this has been a \nrequirement by donors for some time, appreciation of the benefits from their inclusion has not \nbeen  recognized  within  the  government  implementing  agencies.  Experience  from  recently \ncompleted projects demonstrates that staff in the line agencies (especially at the provincial level \nand  below)  do  not  appreciate  the  benefits  obtainable  from  compliance  (e.g.,  increasing \nownership, making designs more appropriate, and making investments sustainable). Current \nlaws and decrees devolve responsibility for rural development to local administrations; and \nassign  responsibilities  to  them  for  safeguards  in  respect  of  land  acquisition,  resettlement, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  and  mitigation  and  community  participation  in  decision \nmaking.  Similarly,  the  policies  and  safeguard  compliance  requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will need to be addressed in the preparation of subprojects. \n \n3.  The TA (proposed to be financed from the Japan Special Fund) will fund international \nand  national  specialists  to  develop  training  material  and  provide  on-the-job  training  as \nsubprojects are screened, prioritized, and evaluated. Under the TA, national and provincial staff \nwill be trained to ensure that social and environmental safeguards compliance is incorporated \ninto investment proposals, and to monitor adherence of approved investments with specified \ncovenants. In addition, the TA will provide resources for equipment, materials, and training for \nthe development of a database at the national and provincial levels, recording information on \n(i) social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluations  of  feasibility  studies  for  investment \nproposals; and (ii) records for monitoring compliance with safeguards.  \n \nC.  Costs and Financing \n4.  It is estimated that the TA will cost $800,000. Of this, $700,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) will provide $100,000 to cover incremental \nadministrative expenses, office space, local travel, and per diem for counterpart staff.

The four goals are (i) increased food production and \nsecurity; (ii) increased production of materials for agro-processing; (iii) stabilization of shifting cultivation (the main \nstrategy  of  poverty  reduction  in  the  47  poorest  districts  while  providing  for  environmental  protection);  and \n(iv) sustainable  forest  management.  As  the  Project  will  develop  sector  management  capacities  and  finance \nsubprojects, contributing to investment in resource management and productivity enhancement management, the \ndesign is supportive of sector objectives. \n \nThe country strategy and program 2007\u20132011 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to promote pro-poor, \nsustainable growth led by the private sector, by improving policies and institutional capacity to support broad-based, \nprivate sector-led growth.b It proposes to support the building of a legal and regulatory framework and developing \ncapacity in sectors and subsectors\u2014specifically identifying agriculture as a target. The strategy supports greater \ninvolvement of civil society and mass organizations in the delivery of agriculture and basic social services. Support \nwill be provided to private business associations to improve their ability to network, develop business skills, and \nadvocate on behalf of their membership\u2014expanding livelihood opportunities for rural women as well as men in \ncommercial agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprise development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification:     General intervention \n1. Key Issues \nA key poverty issue is the impact from foreign direct investment (FDI) that limits smallholder access to land and forest \nresources from which smallholders obtain their traditional subsistence existence. There is poor coordination between \ncentral and provincial/district levels in the application of policies for FDI. The Government has the right to determine \nand change land categories, allowing local authorities to reclassify village land from \u201cproductive\u201d to \u201cunproductive\u201d to \nmeet concessionaires\u2019 demands. Procedures for awarding concessions are not clear and awards take place in an ad \nhoc fashion. This institutional weakness and poor governance is compounded by a lack of awareness of safeguard \nissues. The demand for land by plantation-style FDI has been directed at areas previously used in swidden \nproduction systems, where ethnic groups predominate and poverty is most apparent. Some 75% of poor households \ncountrywide are made up of members of ethnic groups living in remote and upland areas on marginally productive \nland. \n \n2.  Design Features \nTo address these issues, the Project will develop the capacities of the provincial agriculture and forestry offices to \nidentify land suitability for a range of potential crops so that informed decisions can be made when allocating land. \nThe  capacity  building  will  extend  to  strengthening  agency  staff\u2019s  understanding  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards to protect the interests of traditional users of the resources under consideration. The Project will also \nprovide funding for demand-based rural infrastructure and other successful subprojects to increase agricultural \nproductivity to facilitate smallholder participation in commercialization in the market economy. While many of the \nsubprojects are expected to be small-scale rural infrastructure investments, subproject design will incorporate land \ntenure activities to protect the interests of traditional land-users in subproject areas. The skills developed in land \nsuitability mapping using geographic information systems can readily be applied to subproject design to demark \nprotected and production forest areas to be managed by villagers. These subprojects will be selected through a \nscreening process, using established criteria and safeguards outlined in Supplementary Appendix C, which ensure \nidentification of appropriate beneficiaries with attention to gender issues and indigenous people\u2019s concerns. The \nProject will train implementing staff in developing and applying mechanisms for the participation of all vulnerable \ngroups, women, and ethnic minorities; and ensuring community demand is articulated. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  47\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nIn the year 2000\u201301, 304,100 households were classified \u201cpoor\u201d throughout the country. This decreased to 166,600 \nby 2005. The population of the five target provinces is 1.8 million, ranging from 0.8 million in Savannakhet to \n0.11 million in Sekong. While the poor represent 38% of the project area\u2019s population, the incidence of poverty in \nparticipating provinces varies from 42% in Savannakhet to only 5% in Sekong and 7% in Attapeu. The provinces with \nthe greatest number and highest percentage of poor are Savannakhet and Champassak. At the village and district \nlevel, other factors are brought into consideration in assessing poverty, including access to education, health \nservices, road access, as well as access to clean drinking water. These criteria significantly alter the perspective of \npoverty from the income-based assessment with individual households. \n \nThere are 40 districts in the five provinces, of which 19 are considered priority poor (7 in Savannakhet, 4 in \nChampassak, 3 in Salavan and Attapeu each, and 2 in Sekong). Within these poor districts, household poverty levels \naverage over 50% although Champassak has a figure closer to 20%. Assessed on a village basis, about 70% of the \nvillages are poor; this ranges from 50% in Champassak to over 80% in Attapeu and Sekong. Proportional figures are \nmisleading, though, and the actual numbers of poor households are by far the greatest in Savannakhet and \nChampassak, accounting for over 70% of the poor households in the participating provinces. A further dimension of \npoverty relates to the predominance of ethnic groups within the target area. About half of the population in the \nfive provinces is comprised of indigenous peoples known in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) as \nethnic groups, mostly from the Mon-Khmer language family. The proportion of ethnic groups is highest in Sekong \n(88%) and Attapeu (63%) but actual numbers are greatest in Savannakhet and Champassak. Poverty is significantly \nhigher among minority groups than in lowland Lao communities. \n \nBecause of this isolation, villagers are heavily dependent on forest access for daily edibles and non-timber forest \nproducts, some of which are sold to earn cash for food purchase. In the five provinces, there are serious economic \nconsequences for poor villagers that lose access to forest resources through unrestrained concession award and \nunplanned relocation. Some concessionaires are clearing and converting forestland contrary to government policy. \nFDI has increased the risk of staple food shortages. Ethnic minority villages are required to cease shifting cultivation \nand resettle at lower elevations, forming larger communities where government services can be provided.c  \n \nAnother difficulty with merged administrations from resettlement is that several different ethnic groups are often \ngrouped together in one village or location, requiring longer preparation time for consultation with each set of elders. \nThose villages that have been resettled within walking distance of their old land continue to grow upland rice in these \nlocations. However, because of the distance to these fields, they are not able to clear, plant, and maintain as large an \narea as before. In addition, some villagers complain of declining production caused by a combination of increased \npopulation (as a result of merging of villages) and land degradation. Government policy on reducing shifting \ncultivation may also have limited village access to sufficient productive land. \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. During the implementation of the TA, workshops and a number of meetings in provincial, district offices and \nvillages were organized to seek views of stakeholders. During fact-finding mission (August 2008) a number of \nprovincial and district government officials were consulted together with villages that had experience with FDI. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  \n  Information sharing      Consultation      Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation (C&P) plan prepared?     Yes      No \n \nA C&P plan has been prepared and this is mainstreamed into the gender, disadvantaged persons and ethnic group \naction plan. Subproject identification is based on community demand. Mechanisms have been designed to ensure \ncommunity participation and consultation in subproject survey, design and implementation. Government officers will \nbe trained in subproject preparation and implementation that require high local participation. The C&P recognizes \nthat ethnic groups and subgroups in communities require specific measures in order that their development priorities \nare articulated. Government staff will receive training in C&P and participatory methods including gender and \ndisadvantaged group strategies. The Project will engage local community assistance in the implementation of \nsubprojects particularly in ethnic group communities utilizing skilled local people as community organizers assisting \nproject staff. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \n \nC. Gender and Development \n \n1. Key Issues \nRural Lao women are primarily responsible for maintaining family food security, a role often underestimated. \nPrevailing cultural values tend to disadvantage women in terms of their participation in politics and decision-making \nprocesses, and they are underrepresented in village committees. Similarly, ethnic group women are not well \npresented in government, particularly extension workers, health care workers, and teachers. By virtue of their \ngeographic location, they are isolated from resources and services. They are also the least able to participate in \ndecision making, partly because of illiteracy and cultural traditions. Linguistic barriers and cultural attitudes toward \neducation perpetuate low human development and the vicious cycle of poverty in which many ethnic groups find \nthemselves. \n \nThe Government has asked all ministries to develop strategies and action plans to promote gender equality at \nnational, provincial, district, and village levels. Line agencies have begun to mainstream gender concerns. However, \nMAF has not started integrating gender into its planning cycle; its main efforts are in donor-funded projects. MAF has \na gender focal point and women advancement committee but its role and responsibilities are not clear\u2014nor is it \nstrong enough to integrate gender policies into practice. Constraints on gender mainstreaming in MAF are a poor \nunderstanding of gender concept and strategies, lack of resource persons with gender professional knowledge, and \nno statistical information related to gender issues. \n \nLand rights of women show a difference in the names and or titles that appear on the land documents and the origin \nof the land. Only 16% of land was registered in the wife\u2019s name, although 40% of the land came from the wife\u2019s \nparents. Fifty-eight percent of land was registered in the husband\u2019s name, although only 18% of the land came from \nthe husband\u2019s parents. Part of this situation can be attributed to the lack of knowledge on and difficulty in accessing \ninformation on women\u2019s land rights. In addition, except for selected Mon-Khmer groups such as Brao, it is a generally \nheld view that men are the head of household, so their names appear on administrative documents. \n \n2.  Key Actions \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n \n  Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nA gender and disadvantaged group strategy has been formulated to ensure women\u2019s participation in the articulaton \nof needs, and priorities in decision making are facilitated. Criteria for subproject identification, preparation, and \nimplementation include attention to gender issues. Subprojects should be sensitive to women\u2019s time constraints that \nare determined by seasonal agricultural requirements and cultural differences. The gender action plan (Appendix 13 \nand  Supplementary  Appendix  J)  ensures  consultation  with  local  women  in  the  design  of  new  subprojects \n(productivity, commercialization, and natural resource management) and assures that they participate in project \nactivities, including extension services and training. \n \nIII.

The Sustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project \naims to improve agricultural productivity through more efficient and sustainable use of natural \nresources, and will build the capacity of the Government to make more informed decisions on \nland use planning and zoning\u2014particularly as a response to the increased level of foreign direct \ninvestment in the southern provinces. The Project will generate three main outputs covering: (i) \ncapacity  building  in  sector  management,  (ii)  agricultural  productivity  and  commercialization \nsubprojects,  and  (iii) project  management.

About half the population in the proposed target of five provinces (Attapeu, Champassak \nSaravane, Savannakhet, and Sekong) comprises non-Lao Loum ethnic groups.1 The five project \nprovinces officially recorded 33 distinct ethnic minorities, not including small numbers of migrated \ngroups from other provinces such as Lolo, Akha and Hor. Identified ethnic groups in the provinces \nbelong to seven different Austro-Asiatic language groups and subgroups, including 13 Bahnaric \n(6 Bahnaric, 6 Bahnaric West, 1 Bahnaric North); 2 Palaungic; 9 Katuic; and 1 Vietic.  \n \n3.  The main impact of the Project on ethnic groups will be through subproject implementation \nunder component 2.2 The process of identification of subprojects will be driven by community \ndemand.  Requests  will  be  forwarded  from  the  community  to  the  line  agency  technically \nresponsible for the proposed subproject. Most requests will probably be for the rehabilitation of \nrural infrastructure such as feeder roads, irrigation, or post-harvest improvements. However, the \nrange of subprojects will include others that contribute to increasing agriculture productivity. \nThese  proposals  are  supposed  to  be  the  result  of  a  community\u2019s  internal  consultation  and \nconsensus\u2014leading to an official request signed and stamped by the village head (and kumban \n(village cluster) head if applicable), and being submitted to the district. Specific ethnic group \ndevelopment plans will be formulated on a case-by-case basis as subprojects funded under \n                                                 \n1  Attapeu 63%, Champassack 15%, Salavane 42%, Savannakhet 38%, and Sekong 87%.  \n2  Ethnic groups will benefit rather indirectly from component 1 activities (other than capacity building on farmer, \nproducer, and water user associations). \n ", "Appendix 11  51\ncomponent 2 are identified and approved for full feasibility and then implementation. Therefore, \nthe main purpose of this framework is to assist in the preparation of an ethnic group development \nplan (EGDP), which will be attached to the subproject feasibility studies under component 2. \n \n4.  The Project adopts the following procedure for preparing, implementing, and monitoring \nand evaluating an EGDP. \n \n(i)  Subproject  selection  screening.  The  Project  has  established  eligibility  and \nselection criteria for component 2 subprojects. These provide a pro-poor scoring \nmechanism that would facilitate higher scores in ethnic group communities if these \ncommunities suffer a higher incidence of poverty. \n(ii)  Mobilization of ethnic group local resource person. At the subproject feasibility \nstudy stage, it is important that ethnic group communication is facilitated by the \nuse  of  local  ethnic  group  resource  persons.  The  Project  will  provide  a  daily \nallowance ($200 per subproject) for assistance provided from key local people who \nwill  assist  in  conducting  meetings,  disseminating  information,  and  facilitating \nparticipatory consultations. \n(iii)  Feasibility study. Ethnic group focal groups are formed at the feasibility study \nphase to ensure that all groups and subgroups have been given the opportunity to \nenter the discussion; and that decisions taken are transparent, equitable, and \nsupported by the community. It would help the Project to ensure that subprojects \ndo not threaten traditional and practiced ethnic group livelihood systems, and do \nnot require the adoption of totally new livelihood systems They will participate in \ndeciding road alignment or irrigation canal alignments, or the location and design \nof  other  infrastructure  to  ensure  they  are  not  disadvantaged  and  have  equal \naccess to the investment\u2019s benefits. \n(iv)  Establishment of committees. For rural infrastructure projects such as road and \nirrigation development, the Project will establish (a) a construction committee (at \nthe  survey,  design,  and  project  planning  stage);  and  (b)  an  infrastructure \nmanagement  committee  for  ongoing  management  and  operations.  Any  such \nbodies established at community level to provide these functions will include ethnic \ngroup representation at a level appropriate to the proportionate number of ethnic \ngroup households in the community. \n(v)  Impact  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Implementation  of  the  ethnic  group \ndevelopment  framework  or  plan  will  be  integrated  in  the  Project\u2019s  project \nperformance monitoring system. Implementation monitoring will be undertaken by \nthe Government (project coordination office and provincial project offices) as part \nof its normal project management responsibilities, while benefit monitoring will be \nundertaken  periodically  (annually  after  year  2)  through  an  independent \norganization or institution. \n \n5.  Safeguards relating to ethnic groups and implementation of the ethnic group development \nframework/EGDP will be built into the subproject feasibility study process. Actual implementation \nwill be assisted by the project consultants, both the long-term advisers in the provinces (324 \nperson-months) and also at the central level by the project coordination office adviser (24 person-\nmonths). The Project will also mobilize short-term specialist input on ethnic groups and gender \nand the environment (28 person-months). These short-term specialists will also be involved in the \nsubproject identification, screening, and approval process to ensure that safeguards are being \napplied in accordance with policy and project design. In line with their terms of reference, they will \nprovide  written  assessments  to  project  management  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank. \nPreparation of the EGDP is included in the budget for preparation of subproject feasibility studies \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  Project  Background.  The  Sustainable  Natural  Resources  Management  and \nProductivity Enhancement Project (the Project) comprises (i) capacity building of central and \nprovincial  agencies  in  natural  resource  management  techniques  and  procedures;  (ii)  the \nimplementation of a number of subprojects of value from $100,000 and $500,000 to facilitate \nrural development within the target provinces of Attapeu, Champassak Saravane, Savannakhet, \nand Sekong; and (iii) project management and implementation support. The subprojects to be \nincluded in the Project will be selected during implementation on the basis of agreed criteria, \nincluding the number of people expected to benefit, poverty level of beneficiaries, minimal \namount  of  resettlement  and  environmental  impact,  and  environmental  sustainability. \nImplementation of the subprojects will enable rural communities in the project area to maximize \ntheir benefits from the proposed intervention. Eligible subprojects involving rural infrastructure \nprojects will include rehabilitation of rural roads, access tracks, and the construction and/or \nrehabilitation of small- and medium-scale irrigation. Other eligible subprojects might include \ninitiatives that are not related to infrastructure, such as the extension of technical support \nservices to common interest farmer groups, or improving the linkages between producer groups \nand processors. Detailed design of subprojects, regardless of their nature, will explore all viable \noptions to reduce the requirements for land acquisition and resettlement to the extent feasible. \n2.  Preparation  of  Resettlement  Plans.  Improvement  of  rural  access  roads,  irrigation \nfacilities, and other rural infrastructure will be within existing road alignments, irrigation facilities, \netc. as much as possible. In addition, priority will be given to avoiding or minimizing resettlement \nimpacts.  Therefore,  the  need  for  resettlement  plans  will  be  relatively  small.  Resettlement \nimpacts, if any, are expected not to be significant (category B), so short resettlement plans will \nbe prepared. \n3.  Legal and Policy Framework. The resettlement framework is developed from the laws \nand decrees of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and the \nrelevant  policies  and  guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Provisions  and \nprinciples adopted in the resettlement framework will supplement the provisions of relevant \ndecrees currently in force in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists. \n4.  Objectives and Entitlements. The overall policy objective is to ensure that all people \naffected by the Project will be able to restore their pre-project conditions, while the poor and \nvulnerable households will be able to improve their pre-project living standards. Compensation \nwill be based on the principle of replacement cost while additional assistance in cash and kind \nwill also be provided, depending on the severity of impacts. Relocation and income restoration \nmeasures for severely affected and vulnerable households will be designed and implemented in \nconsultation with affected persons during resettlement plan preparation. Voluntary donation will \nnot be applied for any assets, except very minor losses of residential land. The Project will \nidentify any specific needs or concerns to be considered for indigenous peoples groups and \nother  vulnerable  groups  such  as  the  landless,  poor,  and  households  headed  by  women, \ndisabled, elderly, or children without means of support. A gender strategy and ethnic group \nspecific actions, as required, will be included in the subproject resettlement plan. \n \n5.  Consultation and Disclosure. Consultation will be undertaken prior to finalization of \ndetailed design so that affected persons\u2019 requests and suggestions to minimize resettlement \nimpacts  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  as  far  as  is  practicable.  Consultation  and \nparticipation activities will continue throughout project implementation to ensure that information \nabout  the  overall  Project  and  resettlement-related  information  is  properly  understood  and \naccepted by the affected persons. \n ", "Appendix 12  53\n \n6.  Implementation Arrangements. The Project will be managed by a project coordination \noffice (PCO) to be established within the Department of Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF). The PCO will be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project. At \nthe provincial level, the Provincial Governors\u2019 Office with its provincial project offices (PPOs) will \nbe  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  organizations  involved  in  resettlement  and  for \nresettlement plan preparation and updating, supervision, and management of resettlement plan \nimplementation. A resettlement committee will be established in each province to prepare and \nimplement resettlement plans, and will be supported by safeguards consultants. In accordance \nwith Decree 192/PM, the Water Resources and Environment Administration (WREA) and its \nrespective provincial representative offices will review and approve the resettlement plan prior to \nsubmission to ADB. WREA is also responsible for monitoring of resettlement activities. It will \nreview all internal and external monitoring reports and undertake periodic inspections. \n7.  Grievance Redress. At the central level, within MAF\u2019s Department of Planning, a task \nforce will be established to receive and resolve complaints and grievances or act upon reports \nfrom stakeholders on projects in general, including grievances caused by resettlement and \nenvironmental issues. At the project level, the grievance procedure uses a five-step approach, \ni.e., affected persons can lodge their complaint with the village officials first and the case will be \nforwarded to the district, provincial and central level if the case is unresolved or not satisfactory \nto the affected persons. The last resort will be lodged with the Court of Law, whose decision will \nbe final. Affected persons will be made fully aware of the grievance process and their rights \nverbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and time of compensation. \n \n8.  Monitoring and Budget. Primary responsibility for internal monitoring will lie with PPOs \nas implementing agencies responsible for overseeing the formation, function, and activities of \neach of the implementing agencies for subprojects; and through quarterly monitoring reports. \nThe Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the disbursement of funds to each of the relevant \nProvincial Governor\u2019s Offices. These funds will be managed by the resettlement committee. The \nGovernment will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for resettlement to meet any \nunforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement budget estimates to satisfy resettlement \nrequirements and objectives. ADB and International Fund for Agricultural Development grant \nfunds will be utilized for compensation for non-land assets, provision of necessary allowances, \nspecial assistance to be provided to vulnerable affected persons, development of individual \nreplacement plots, administration costs, and external monitoring. The resettlement plans will \nidentify key activities for which funds will be used, any disbursal milestones, and auditing \nrequirements that will facilitate appropriate and timely delivery. \n \n9.  Implementation Schedule. Land acquisition, compensation, and relocation of affected \npersons cannot commence until the resettlement plan, when required for individual subprojects, \nhas been reviewed and approved by ADB. Civil works may commence in sections where there \nare no resettlement impacts. All resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works \nschedule. The PPO will not allow construction activities in specific sites until all resettlement \nactivities have been satisfactorily completed, agreed rehabilitation assistance is in place, and \nthe site is free of all encumbrances. \n10.  Disclosure of Resettlement Planning Documents. This resettlement framework will \nbe uploaded on the ADB website before appraisal. The PPO and resettlement committees will \nbe responsible for disclosure of the resettlement plan to affected persons prior to submission to \nADB. ADB will upload the final resettlement plan on ADB\u2019s resettlement webpage. \n \n ", " \n \nSUMMARY GENDER ACTION PLAN  5\n4\n   \nImplementation \nComponent  Activities  Indicators  Targets  Timing \nResponsibility  A\np\nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  In view of the sector lending modality, an economic analysis has been carried out on the \nproposed loan based on Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines contained in Economics \nResearch Division Technical Note No. 14: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan.1 The proposed \nProject is an investment grant. However, because of the significant number and location of \npotential subprojects within the target provinces, it was not possible to identify all subprojects \nduring design\u2014nor was it appropriate, as the Government has already demonstrated capacity \nto implement a sector modality project. The Project also seeks to influence policy development \nand thereby qualifies as a sector loan. More detailed analysis of two representative subprojects \n(to  confirm  they  are  economically  viable  and  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction)  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. Further material on the sector (including its planning context) is in \nAppendix 3. \n \nB.  Rationale for Government and ADB Involvement \n2.  The  Government  is  ultimately  responsible  for  management  of  the  country\u2019s  natural \nresources  to  ensure  their  current  and  continuing  productivity.  With  the  recent  and  largely \nunmanaged surge in foreign direct investment (FDI), negative impacts are already becoming \nobvious.  The  incidence  of  conflict  over  land  has  increased  dramatically,  with  both \nconcessionaires and traditional landowners uncertain of their rights. FDI has effectively denied \naccess by traditional users of forest areas, and their livelihoods have been threatened. The \nshort-term response was to introduce a moratorium on the issue of new land concessions until \nMay 2008. A longer-term solution is needed to rationalize this potentially valuable source of \ninvestment, and manage it to minimize negative externalities. \n \n3.  Another part of the rationale for government involvement is that rural infrastructure is \nlargely a public good (benefits are largely non-excludable and non-subtractable).2 Infrastructure \ninvestments tend to require large capital resources, which preclude private investment, since \nthe means for recovering rents or user charges are not well developed in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  in  spite  of  some  unachieved  policies  regarding  irrigation \nmanagement and transfer.3 With the exception of irrigation facilities and water supplies, where \ntarget beneficiaries can be clearly identified, benefits from investment are distributed over a \nlarge and unidentifiable number of users. This reinforces the public nature of the investment. \nSimilarly, the proposed support to producer associations and farmer groups is not likely to be \ncarried out by the private sector. \n \n4.   ADB\u2019s comparative advantage as a participant in the Project arises from three main \nsources.  Firstly,  previous  long-term  agriculture  and  natural  resources  and  multi-sector \nexperience (both policy and project-based) is unmatched by any other donor in the Lao PDR. \nThis has contributed to robust project design and will continue to underlie and inform project \nimplementation, especially as a mixture of policy and technical support is envisaged. A history \nof long-term cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) (particularly the \nDepartment of Planning) will provide a solid foundation for long-term implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Economics Research Division. 2004. Technical Note No. 14: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. Manila:  ADB. \n2  Subtractability refers to the degree to which one person\u2019s use of a resource diminishes others\u2019 use. \n3  For example the failure to achieve the stated policy of full irrigation management and transfer while maintaining \nefficient operations of the irrigation scheme. \n ", "Appendix 14  57\n \n5.   Secondly, ADB value added in the proposed investment is enhanced by its ability to both \nleverage International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) funding and integrate with the \nongoing  work  of  other  donors.  The  World  Bank,  Agence  Francaise  Developpement,  and \nEuropean Community are investigating major funding for initiatives in the north of the Lao PDR. \nTherefore, it makes sense in terms of donor harmonization for more attention to be paid\u2014in the \nform of a number of subproject investments\u2014to the relatively neglected southern provinces \n(several of which are particularly remote in geographic and administrative/historical terms). \n \n6.   Thirdly, the Project\u2019s location and its constituent activities exploit linkages with existing \nADB-supported subregional initiatives. Insofar as they relate to the proposed Project, the three \nmain  subregional  features  are  (i)  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor,  which  runs  across \nSavannakhet and whose facilities subprojects will be able to exploit; (ii) the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Core Agriculture Support Program, several of whose key strategic thrusts \ndirectly support objectives and activities of the proposed Project (e.g., facilitation of cross-border \ntrade  and  investment  in  agriculture,  policy  support  for  cross-border  contract  farming);  and \n(iii) the GMS Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative,4 \nwhere both skills and experiences of GMS countries will be solicited in project implementation \n(e.g., for land use planning and geographic information system training). \n \nC.  Goals of the Plan \n7.  The Government\u2019s guiding document is the Sixth National Socio Economic Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010).5 MAF has translated its content into specific targets and objectives through \nits own strategic document, which outlines four overall objectives to be achieved through the \nimplementation of 13 measures. The four strategic objectives are (i) increased food production \nand security\u2014annual food production equivalent of 3.3 million tons of rice, increasing national \naverage consumption to 350 kilograms per head per year (including poor districts), together with \nother targets for protein; (ii) increased production of materials for agro-processing\u2014directed at \ndomestic processing to allow agriculture and forestry exports to increase to 30% of the value of \nexports ($1 billion by 2010); (iii) stabilization of shifting cultivation\u2014the main strategy of poverty \nreduction  in  the  47  poorest  districts  while  providing  for  environmental  protection;  and  (iv) \nsustainable forest management\u2014to increase forest cover from 42% to 53% (12 million hectares \nby 2010) with commercial plantations. The 13 measures have been developed to give effect to \nthese overall objectives with the use of government budget and donor support, and are being \nfunded in part by donor and budget funds. One of the main items identified in the 13 measures \nis the need to improve market access through rehabilitation of rural infrastructure. \n \nD.  Associated Economic Policies \n9.  Two recent policy initiatives likely to affect the agriculture and natural resources sector, \nother than the sector development policy itself, are (i) the policy on decentralization\u2014for the \nmanagement of land resources and technical support services, and (ii) the policy for maintaining \nirrigation infrastructure. As for the first, the Government has attached significant importance to \nthe ability of kumbans (village clusters) and districts to identify investments. However, to date, \nthe funds for such investments are essentially limited to initiatives funded by bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. Items identified at this level tend to be smaller-scale public investments of \nimmediate  relevance  to  the  concerned  communities.  They  tend  not  to  have  the  broader \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

This  has  created  an \nopportunity  for  coordination  with  these  smaller  scale  investments  to  increase  their  impact. \nLinking a number of village or kumban roads with a district road has the potential for a far \ngreater impact than the road alignment in its own right. \n \n10.  The second policy is related to irrigation management and transfer. The Government \nwishes to recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs from the immediate beneficiaries. \nWater users associations have been charged with responsibility for setting water service fees to \nrecover O&M costs. For the larger schemes, the pricing policy does not provide for full cost \nrecovery. In many cases, recovered user charges are insufficient to meet immediate O&M \nneeds and a significant public need remains to maintain the operations of pumping equipment \nthat rely on expensive electricity. Local authorities cannot afford to finance comprehensive O&M \nas provincial budgetary allocations are limited and assets inevitably deteriorate. With limited \nresources available in districts and provinces to maintain O&M support of irrigation facilities, \nparticularly for more expensive periodic maintenance, facilities are seldom maintained in sound \nworking order. The Project has addressed this issue by supporting further development of O&M \npolicy by providing technical and policy specialists under the Project. \n \nE.  Government and Local Consultant Capacity \n11.  The Government has demonstrated capacity to implement ADB-funded sector modality \nprojects such as the Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project, the Northern Community \nManaged Sector Project, and the Decentralized Irrigation Sector Management Project, two of \nwhich  are  due  to  be  completed  in  2009.6 The  Government  has  demonstrated  capacity  to \nidentify, prioritize, and prepare detailed designs for the implementation of these sector modality \nprojects.  The  ADB-funded  Decentralized  Irrigation  Sector  Management  Project  is  being \nimplemented through provincial project management units, where there was significant capacity \nbuilding in the identification, design, works supervision, and project management in general. \nWhile a recent review mission assessed that more capacity building was needed in safeguards \nand  economic  evaluation,  the  project  has  demonstrated  that  capacity  to  implement  the \nproposed Project has been established.  \n \nF.  Fiscal Impacts \n12.  The majority of the subprojects will comprise a mix of rural infrastructure, together with \n\u201csoft\u201d initiatives for farmer group support or technical extension services. Most of the rural \ninfrastructure rehabilitated under the Project will be of sufficient size that it is unlikely that \ncommunities  will  assume  responsibility  for  its  maintenance.  In  the  case  of  irrigation \nrehabilitation, the Government is committed to charging water user charges to provide for O&M \nrequirements. Where it is possible to identify and charge local beneficiaries for contributions to \nO&M, the immediate beneficiaries will be able to contribute to routine maintenance. For roads \nand other public infrastructure, the funding of periodic and routine maintenance will become the \nresponsibility  of  the  provinces.  This  places  a  significant  demand  on  provincial  and  district \nresources. While the revenue-raising capacity of rural-based provinces is limited, the issue of \nsustainability  is  very  much  dependent  on  central  government  budgetary  allocations. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 14  59\n \nSustainability  is  only  partly  a  financial  management  issue;  it  is  more  an  issue  of  limited \nresources. \n \n13.  A review of the financial positions of the five target provinces shows significant growth in \nthe level of financial activity, sources of funding, and allocation of these funds to both capital \nand recurrent expenditure. In the 12 months ended September 2007, annual budget receipts \nper capita (from all sources) in the target provinces varied considerably. The highest was almost \nexclusively comprised of transfers from the central Government. Provinces maintain their focus \non funding capital investment, accounting for about 20% of provincial expenditure on average. \nThe heavy dependence on the central government for budget resources averages over 80% for \ntarget  provinces.  It  is  lower  in  Champassak,  where  there  is  a  rapidly  developing  trading \neconomy  with  neighboring  countries.  In  Attapeu,  economic  development  opportunities  are \nlimited and there is greater dependence on the central Government. The provincial allocation of \nmaintenance budgets continues to be a challenge for resource-poor provinces. Furthermore, as \ntheir  economies  develop,  greater  allocations  will  be  needed  for  recurrent  expenditure  on \nmaintenance rather than keeping their focus on new infrastructure investment. \n \n14.  ADB funds are not fully fungible as the two financing sources\u2014ADB and IFAD\u2014have \nbeen specified in the design for subprojects. The allocation of counterpart funds has not been \nproposed in view of the limitations described. \n \nG.  Economic Risks \n15.  The major  economic risk to the successful outcome of the Project is the need for \nperiodic and routine maintenance to sustain benefits. The economic analysis in Supplementary \nAppendix L draws attention to the sensitivity of the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for \nthe representative subprojects to maintenance for road subprojects in particular. If the benefit \nstream stops 5 years after rehabilitation, the estimated EIRR becomes negative; if this happens \nafter 10 years, the EIRR falls below the cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis of the Kaenghet \nRoad Rehabilitation Subproject suggests that the EIRR will be about 13.3% if maintenance \nstops after 5 years, and 20.7% if maintenance stops after 10 years. The situation is similar for \nthe Hatxaysoung Irrigation Rehabilitation Subproject, with an EIRR of 14.6% if maintenance \nstops after 5 years and an EIRR of 18.5% if it ceases after 10 years. \n \n16.  The importance of attending to maintenance of rehabilitated rural infrastructure cannot \nbe overstated, as it has such a dramatic impact on the benefits achieved. The economic risk \nidentified is partly related to policy\u2014tariffs do not reflect the real operational cost of rehabilitated \ninfrastructure\u2014but  is  equally  a  function  of  limited  resources  to  maintain  structures.  The \nsubproject  identification  process  will  partly  ensure  that  resources  are  allocated  to  the \nrehabilitated infrastructure, but there will be a period of time between the commitment to a \nmaintenance  program  and  the  commitment  of  budgetary  resources  during  which  such \nundertakings  could  be  forgotten.  It  is  therefore  important  to  formalize  commitments  for \nmaintenance  by  the  provinces  and  set  minimum  financing  quantities  for  specific  items  of \ninfrastructure where possible. \n \nH.  Government Commitment \n17.  The commitment of both central and provincial government was strong during the ADB-\nfunded preparation of the Project.7 This was manifest, among other things, by the presence of \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 4843), approved on 15 September 2006, for $750,000. \n ", "60   Appendix 14 \ndeputy governors from participating provinces at workshops. The province administrations see \nconsiderable merit in the scope and objectives of the Project, as it has been developed in a \nparticipatory  manner  with  numerous  workshops  and  individual  consultations.  What  is \nappreciated is the expectation that there will be greater management over what is currently out \nof hand\u2014FDI and its consequences for land resources management. Government commitment \nis clear, as it has welcomed the overall objectives and it will build local capacities where the \ndecision making is taken. The provision of substantial funds will allow the provinces to prioritize \ntheir development investments in a participatory manner that has not been available to them in \nthe past. \n \nI.  Coordination of Foreign Aid \n18.  There are a number of international agencies and bilateral donors working in rural \ndevelopment (Appendix 4) as well as limited state-funded initiatives. The Government has \npromoted a broad-based, sector-wide approach to coordinate rural development for improving \nthe impact from donor support, improving communication between donors, and adopting a more \nunified approach under the Government\u2019s guidance. The formation of the upland working group \nin the north of the country appears to be an effective means for coordinating donor support. The \nADB and IFAD-funded project has worked closely with this group during project preparation, as \na number of policy-related topics are common to both areas, particularly in respect of land \ntenure, concessions, and preserving the rights of traditional land users to the forest resource. \n \nJ.  Conditions Attached to the Loan \n19.  Most  conditions  for  the  Project  relate  to  subproject  identification  and  have  been \nincorporated in the selection criteria. The Project is intended to have national impact through \npolicy development in respect of land tenure, issuance of land concessions, incorporation of \nsafeguards, and more rigor in investment appraisal. It will also influence the protection of user \nrights on traditional upland farming areas. In addition, it will develop awareness of the need for \nsafeguards  (through  the  associated  capacity  development  technical  assistance)  when \nconsidering proposed investments. The criteria for subprojects will ensure that these aspects \nare considered in the selection process (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix C) and are \nconfirmed in the loan conditions. \n \nK.  Economic Analysis of Representative Subprojects \n20.  Two representative subprojects were analyzed to determine their suitability for funding. \nEach subproject demonstrated EIRRs in excess of 12%, ranging from 19.3% to 23.5% based on \nthe identified net benefit flows. In each case, additional benefits from the investment could not \nbe readily quantified and estimates were considered conservative. Sensitivity tests were carried \nout  to  the  main  potential  variables  that  might  affect  the  findings,  including  price  declines, \nincreases in capital costs, and a reduction in utilization. Sensitivity to routine and periodic \nmaintenance was also analyzed, with utilization declining to pre-rehabilitation levels after the \nmaintenance ceased. In most cases, the benefits were not sensitive to changes in price levels \nor to increases in unit investment costs. The area of greatest sensitivity was identified from \nmaintenance practices. Where the maintenance ceased after 5 years of operation, the EIRRs \nfell dramatically below the cost of capital. In cases where the maintenance ceased 10 years \nafter completion, the EIRRs were significantly reduced but not below zero, as most of the \nbenefits would have been received before deterioration of the infrastructure. The economic \nbenefit from subproject investments will, because of the selection criteria used, be higher than \nthe opportunity cost of capital and constitute sound economic investments without negative \nsocial and environmental impacts. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090223152311+08'00'", "Author": "krt", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "sustainable natural resources management, productivity enhancement project, lao pdr, adb project 37579", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090225090450+08'00'", "Title": "Sustainable Natural Resource Management and Productivity Enhancement Project"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice-President  C.
