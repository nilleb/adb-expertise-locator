I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Samarkand Solar Power Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will increase renewable energy generation and reduce greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions in Uzbekistan. The project has three main components: (i) construction of a \n100 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic2 power plant including transmission and support facilities, (ii) \ninstitutional capacity development for Uzbekenergo, and (iii) institutional capacity development \nfor solar energy stakeholders. \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Uzbekistan is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive countries in the world,3 both \nover  six  times  the  world  average,  calling  for  drastic  increases  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy. Despite the huge potential, renewable energy supplies less than 11% of \ndemand, and only from hydro resources, which are fully tapped. Over 89% of Uzbekistan\u2019s 12.6 \ngigawatts (GW) of installed capacity are aging carbon-emitting fossil-based power plants, in \npoor  condition,  and  require  huge  investments  for  replacement  or  rehabilitation.  This  is \nintensified  by  grid  losses  of  about  20%,  which  are  partly  due  to  transmission  over  long \ndistances. The inefficient energy sector emitted 88% of Uzbekistan\u2019s 200 million tons of carbon \ndioxide equivalent GHG emissions in 2005.4 The project\u2019s expected 159 GW hours (GWh) of \nclean energy production will avoid about 88,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions \nannually. By supplying electricity where it is consumed, the project will also reduce grid losses. \n \n4.  While Uzbekistan is almost 100% electrified, its aging and overloaded power system \ncauses a supply-demand gap, resulting in prolonged and frequent outages especially in rural \nareas. This affects quality of life, economic activities, and the delivery of social services. Some \nareas  in  Samarkand  have  grid electricity for  only  1-2  hours  in  winter  and  16-18  hours  in \nsummer. Energy supply is further threatened given the country\u2019s depleting fossil-fuel reserves. \nThe reserve to production ratio is 10-12 years for oil, 28-30 years for natural gas, and 40-50 \nyears for coal. Continued reliance on gas accelerates its depletion and hampers diversification \nof the energy mix. It also equals lost export revenues, estimated at $900 million for 2012 alone.5  \n \n5.  With Uzbekistan\u2019s high solar irradiance and abundant land for solar development, solar \nenergy is found the most suitable sustainable resource that could quickly bridge the supply-\ndemand gap, diversify the mix, and reduce emissions. Recognizing this, the government\u2019s \nWelfare Improvement Strategy II6 mandates accelerated development of indigenous renewable \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. In addition to a project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA), a policy advisory TA helped prepare the project. \n2  Mono- and poly-crystalline silicon could be proposed by the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, \nwho will only need to guarantee the output.  \n3  International Energy Agency. 2011. Key World Energy Statistics 2011. Paris. Energy intensity: Total energy supply \nin tons of oil equivalent per gross domestic product (GDP) is 1.97. The world average is 0.31. Carbon intensity is a \nmeasure of how much GHG an economy emits for every dollar of GDP produced, expressed in kilograms of carbon \ndioxide equivalent per GDP. The world average is only 0.73, while Uzbekistan\u2019s is 4.53. \n4  Centre of Hydrometeorological Service, 2010. Second National Communication of the Republic of Uzbekistan \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Tashkent. \n5  TA consultant estimates. In 2012, Uzbekenergo\u2019s average purchase price was $1.46 per million British thermal \nunits, against the average international wholesale price of $3.24 per million British thermal units. \n6  Government of Uzbekistan. 2013. Welfare Improvement Strategy of Uzbekistan II, 2012\u20132015. Tashkent. ", "2 \nenergy, especially solar.  Expertise on the Soviet era solar furnace needs to be enhanced and \nmodern solar applications and industries need to be developed. Thus, Presidential Decree \n45127 mandated the creation of advanced solar industries. Uzbekistan\u2019s objective is to become \nthe region\u2019s solar knowledge and technology hub, and it is targeting 21% renewable energy \ncapacity by 2031, with at least 4 GW of solar capacity. The project, being the first of its kind in \nCentral Asia, brings the needed demonstration, technology transfer, and holistic institutional \ncapacity development for Uzbekenergo and other stakeholders. The government will implement \nthe solar energy development road map8 to achieve a favorable policy framework.  \n \n6.    Aware of the need, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) helped Uzbekistan create the \nInternational Solar Energy Institute (ISEI) through a capacity development technical assistance \n(TA).9 ISEI links research with industry.  Another ADB TA project10 is conducting feasibility \nstudies  for  solar  projects,  including  all  required  due  diligence  for  the  project.  A  project \npreparatory TA (PPTA)11 is assisting in bidding documents preparation and procurement.  \n \n7.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,12 and with the Energy Policy 2009.13 \nThe  project  directly  supports  Uzbekistan\u2019s  clean  energy  and  energy  security  targets  as \nprioritized under the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan14 and is included in \nthe country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan.15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The plant will be located in the Samarkand Province of Uzbekistan, 13 kilometers (km) \nsouthwest of Samarkand city, and 4 km to the north of the regional center of Sazagan. The \nexpected project impact is improved sustainability of the energy supply in Uzbekistan, and the \nexpected outcome is increased renewable energy generation in Uzbekistan. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project will have three main outputs: (i) the construction of a 100 MW16 photovoltaic \npower plant including transmission and support facilities; (ii) institutional capacity development \nfor Uzbekenergo; and (iii) institutional capacity development for solar energy stakeholders.  \n \n10.  Clean and reliable energy. The project will construct a 100 MW photovoltaic power \nplant,  a  transmission  line,  and  support  facilities  in  Samarkand  Province.  This  physical \ncomponent is divided into two contracts: (i) a turnkey contract for the engineering, procurement, \nand  construction  (EPC)  of  the  solar  power  plant  including  the  provision  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) services for 3 years; and (ii) a contract for the supply of goods for the \ntransmission line. Uzbekenergo will prepare the site; install the transmission line; and construct \nthe access road, perimeter fence, wells, and raw water supply facilities.  \n                                                \n7  On measures to further promote the development of alternative energy sources, signed 1 March 2013. \n8  Pending final review and acceptance by the government. \n9  ADB. 2011.

The executing agency will be Uzbekenergo, which will assume overall responsibility of \nproject implementation. Uzbekenergo has established a dedicated full-time project management \nunit (PMU) staffed with qualified personnel with experience in conventional power plants. The \nPMU, funded by the executing agency\u2019s internal resources, will administer all consulting and \nprocurement contracts on the executing agency\u2019s behalf. It will be responsible for preparing \nproject plans, bid evaluation reports, progress reports, applications for the withdrawal of funds, \nand any other reports required by ADB. \n \n18.  Uzbekenergo will employ a turnkey contractor for the photovoltaic power plant EPC and \nO&M services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time). The procurement will follow ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedure using a \nsingle-stage  two-envelope  bidding  method  without  prequalification.  For  the  bidding,  ADB\u2019s \nUser\u2019s  Guide  and  Extended  Standard  Bidding  Documents  for  Plant\u2013Design,  Supply,  and \nInstall21 will be used, and the turnkey contract shall use International Federation of Consulting \nEngineers Conditions of Contract for Design, Build and Operate Projects (general conditions, \nparticular  conditions  and  sample  forms).  The  transmission  line  supply  contract  will  follow \ngovernment procedures since this will be financed by Uzbekenergo.   \n \n19.  Uzbekenergo will recruit an implementation consultant (a firm) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) to assist the PMU \nin project management and to implement the institutional capacity development plans. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n20.  The  proposed  photovoltaic  plant  uses  a  proven  technology  based  on  crystalline  or \npolycrystalline  modules  on  a  fixed  structure,  compatible  with  local  conditions.  The  gross \nestimated output is equal to 159 GWh per year22 measured in the high voltage output terminals \nof the main transformer under standard conditions.23 A 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line will be \nbuilt to enable grid integration. A 4-km access road will be constructed from the plant to the \nexisting road.24 The construction of the proposed photovoltaic plant will take about 18 months. \nGiven the executing agency\u2019s  lack of experience and knowledge in  photovoltaic, the EPC \ncontractor will continue to operate and maintain the plant for 3 years after being commissioned. \nThe implementation consultant will assist in enhancing the O&M skills of Uzbekenergo during \nthe first year of operation. \n \n21.  The power plant primary energy source, solar irradiation, has been estimated from 12 \nyears of satellite data and correlated with ground meteorological data to reduce uncertainty. The \npower plant will be designed, operated, and maintained to guarantee at least 25 years of \noperation with a 0.5 % per year degradation on energy output.  \n \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2010.

The policy and advisory TA consultant \ndeveloped a preliminary design, which is subject to modification by the project preparatory TA consultant and the \ndetailed design of the EPC contractor. The information used to prepare the figures is not contractual. \n23 Standard conditions according to International Electrotechnical Commission 60721-2-1. Standard Test Conditions \nare defined by a module (cell) operating temperature of 25o C (77 oF), and incident solar irradiant level of 1000 Watt \nper square meter and under Air Mass 1.5 spectral distribution. The software and model used took into account \nhourly temperature variations.   \n24 Separately, the government will rehabilitate the 9-km road connecting the access road to the main road prior to \npower plant construction, confirmed by the Samarkand Regional Road Authority to Uzbekenergo on 18 June 2013.   \n ", "6 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The project is economically viable.25 The economic benefits are incremental as a result \nof increased electricity consumption. The economic internal rate of return is 16.1%, which is \ngreater than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12%). Given the carbon-intensive power \nmix  of  Uzbekistan,  the  project  will  avoid  88,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  GHG \nemissions  in  the  first  year  of  operation  alone.  The  price  of  carbon  reduction  and  the \nenvironmental and health benefits are not considered in the financial and economic analyses.  \n \n23.  The levelized energy cost26 (LEC) for the overall project is $0.118 per kWh inclusive of \ntaxes and $0.079 per kWh exclusive of taxes.27 When the 159 GWh28 generated from the power \nplant is added to the national grid, the overall average cost of generation will increase by 0.5%. \nUzbekenergo is able to absorb this increase in the weighted average cost of generation.  \n \n24.  Uzbekenergo has operated profitably over the last 5 years. Financial projections for \n2013\u20132018 indicate that the financial base remains stable provided that the tariff adjustment \nremains in sync with inflation and gas prices. The project\u2019s capacity development program, \naddressing tariff policy and determination methods, among others, will ensure the sustained \nprofitability of Uzbekenergo and enhance its capability in the commercial debt market. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Uzbekenergo needs to strengthen its financial management capacity. Uzbekenergo\u2019s \naccounting policies, procedures, and financial reporting have followed the National Accounting \nStandards of Uzbekistan and National Standards on Auditing. However, in order to enhance its \nfinancial  management,  Uzbekenergo  undertook  an  external  audit  based  on  International \nStandards on Auditing issued by the International Assurance Auditing Standards Board of its \nfinancial statements from the fiscal year ending 31 December 2011. The results indicate the \nneed for further improvements, such as, in the classification methods and impairment provisions \non account receivables, the scope of account consolidation, and the accounting system. For the \nfiscal year ending 31 December 2012, Uzbekenergo has started to adopt International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) conversion with the plan for full conversion to cover all subsidiaries \nfor the fiscal year ending 31 December 2013. The capacity development plan under other ADB \nloan projects will address the training of the IFRS specialists as well as the strengthening of \nUzbekenergo\u2019s information systems with the objective of improving its financial management \ncapability.29 Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk after mitigation is moderate. \n \n26.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed as average risk. As an institution, it \nhas experience with multilateral and bilateral financing institutions including ADB. However, the \nPMU capacity is weak. The PPTA30 consultant will assist in preparing bidding documents and in \nprocurement. An implementation consultant will be recruited to provide project management and \nsupervision support, and to implement the capacity development component to build executing \nagency capacity. Training on procurement and financial management will be conducted by \n                                                \n25The analysis is carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n26 The LEC is the constant price per unit of energy that causes an investment or a payment stream to just break even. \n27 The effective LEC for the solar EPC contract, excluding taxes expected to be exempted, is $0.066 per kWh.  \n28 The expected underated power generation is 159 GWh. The power plant is expected to be derated by 0.5% per \nannum, and this is assumed in the model. The power generation forecasted in 2016 in Uzbekistan is 52,800 GWh.  \n29 ADB. 2010.

An early warning system will be \nestablished to ensure timely procurement and project implementation. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The  project  will  provide  employment31 and  will  impact  income  growth  and  poverty \nreduction in Samarkand district. Indirect impacts on the residents\u2019 living standards and well-\nbeing will be significant.32 Power outages last longer in rural areas compared to urban areas. \nThe households will benefit from reliable access to energy and improved public services, which \nwill improve the economic and social activities of households, and improve living conditions. \n \n29.  The project will provide positive impacts through general intervention to the poor and \nvulnerable groups through several channels:  \n(i)  Employment. Employment and poverty are interrelating indicators. In the project \narea, most of the household income comes from employment. Proper power \nsupply  service  will  improve  enterprise  operation  and  create  new  business \nopportunities, which will in turn improve the employment market and lead to an \nincrease in income of the population.   \n(ii)  Education.  The  household  survey  showed  a  direct  connection  between \neducation levels and poverty. Educational services, which suffer greatly from \nfrequent power interruption, will improve with the enhanced electricity services.  \n(iii)  Health. A poor power supply results in poor winter heating and poor health care \nservice, and handicaps the potable water system. This leads to higher rates of \nintestinal infections and cold-related diseases. Reducing bouts of disease will \nreduce medical expenses and increase the economic activity of households, \nincluding those of women. \n \n30.  Gender. In Uzbekistan, like in many countries, the energy sector is male-dominated, \nwith a low representation of women in decision making. Women occupy relatively lower-paid \npositions, have limited training opportunities, and bear the double burden of unpaid household \nresponsibilities. The number of female employees varies from 2.2% (Joint Stock Company \nSamarkand Electric Networks) to 26% (Dustlik Power Distribution Networks). The gender and \ndevelopment  capacity  of  stakeholders  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Analyses  of  sex-\ndisaggregated  data,  information  campaigns,  and  collaboration  with  women\u2019s  organizations, \nschools, and technical colleges are needed to increase women\u2019s participation in the project\u2019s \ncapacity development activities. To address gender issues, the sanitary and hygiene facilities of \nthe power plant need to be improved for both men and women.  \n \n31.  A rapid gender assessment is reflected in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social \nStrategy.33 The project will increase local energy supply, which will improve living and working \nopportunities, especially for women. Gender elements include capacity development with a \nspecial focus on women. \n                                                \n31 Local labor regulations prohibit exploitive labor practices, including the use of child labor. Adherence to core labor \nstandards is included as a loan covenant. \n32 Policy and advisory TA consultant estimates. \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible form the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environment. The project is a category B project following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and will involve the construction of a new photovoltaic plant and its supporting \nfacilities, which include an access road and a transmission line.  \n \n33.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) for the construction of the new plant and its \nsupporting facilities was carried out to assess impacts, and the environmental management plan \n(EMP)  was  prepared  to  provide  guidance  for  minimizing  any  adverse  impacts.  Public \nconsultations were carried out on 31 May 2013 in Samarkand city. The IEE report was disclosed \non  the  ADB  website  on  16  September  2013.  The  project  will  not  cause  any  significant \nenvironmental impacts. Minor and transient environmental disturbances may occur during the \nconstruction and operation phases. Appropriate mitigation measures have been developed in \nthe EMP, which is subject to updating after the completion of the conceptual system design to \ninclude all technical aspects and to incorporate recommendations from the Samarkand Province \nNature Protection Committee.34 The updated IEE and its EMP will need to be submitted to ADB.  \n \n34.  The PMU on behalf of the executing agency has overall responsibility for implementing \nthe EMP throughout project implementation and completion. The contractor will implement the \nEMP  to  mitigate  all  impacts  related  with  construction  activities.  The  PMU  and  the \nimplementation consultant teams will each have an environmental specialist to supervise the \ncontractor implementing the EMP. A grievance redress mechanism will be established within the \nPMU under Uzbekenergo to resolve complaints, if any. The Uzbekenergo Environment, Health \nand Safety Unit will oversee the implementation of the EMP.  \n \n35.  Social  safeguards.  The  project  will  require  land  acquisition  for  three  types  of \ncomponents: (i) construction of the photovoltaic power plant, (ii) construction of the 220-kV \ntransmission line to the national power grid, and (iii) widening of the 4-km access road from the \npower  plant  up  to the existing  paved  road.  The  project  is categorized  as  a  B  project  for \ninvoluntary resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.   \n \n36.  The  resettlement  plan,  presented  as  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan \n(LARP), was prepared in close consultation with affected people. The total land to be acquired \nis 410.56 hectares (ha), of which total permanent land acquisition is 407.8 ha and temporary \nacquisition 2.76 ha. The permanent acquisition will be used for the power plant (405 ha), access \nroad (1.96 ha), and transmission line (0.84 ha). The temporary land acquisition (2.76 ha) will be \nrequired only during construction of the transmission line. This land acquisition will affect 17 \nhouseholds with a total of 109 persons. The land acquisition for the power plant will have three \nhouseholds; these households belong to farmers and will be impacted severely because they \nwill lose 29.1% to 41.5% of their productive land. The expansion of the access road and the \ntransmission line will not cause any severe impact. None of the three project facilities (power \nplant, access road, and transmission line) will result in any physical displacement of residential \nassets or cause unemployment in affected farms. However, a 675-square-meter structure used \nfor keeping livestock and hay will need to be demolished to construct the power plant. During \nconsultation, two of the 17 households expressed willingness to give up land for compensation. \nThey requested appropriate changes in their lease agreements to reduce their tax payments.  \n \n                                                \n34 Under the government environmental impact requirement, the project falls within category 3 and the updated IEE \nwill require clearance (in the form of an opinion from ecological experts) from the Samarkand Province Nature \nProtection Committee. \n ", "9 \n37.  The LARP for this project was prepared in line with national laws and regulations and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The LARP study was carried out from May to July 2013. Six \nconsultations were carried out in May, and three in July. The consultations were with affected \npeople, local government agencies, and local communities. The estimated compensation costs \nfor land acquisition is around $240,000. Uzbekenergo has adequate experience in implementing \na LARP and will be assisted by the PMU. The PMU will include a social safeguards and gender \nspecialist to coordinate with local agencies to implement the LARP and submit reports to ADB. \nThe  established  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  address  both  environmental  and  social \ncomplaints, if any. The LARP was disclosed through the ADB website on 16 September 2013. \n \n38.  The survey for poverty and social assessment found that there is no community or group \nin the project area that maintains any particular culture, language, or properties distinct from the \ngeneral population. There are four ethnic groups within the local community namely Uzbeks, \nKazakhs, Russians, and Tajiks. None meet the ADB definition of vulnerable indigenous peoples, \nand therefore the project is categorized as a C project for indigenous people or ethnic minority \nrequirements in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. No further study is needed. \n \n39.  Safeguards capacity development. Uzbekenergo has experience implementing ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for both environmental and social safeguards. However, as this will be the first \nsolar  power  plant  in  the  country,  capacity  development  will  be  provided  to  strengthen \nUzbekenergo\u2019s capacity and to ensure adequate resources and institutional capacity are in \nplace  to  manage  environmental  and  social  impacts  associated  with  the  plant.  Capacity \ndevelopment will include a series of awareness campaigns and hands-on practical seminars for \nrelevant agencies and other stakeholders. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 Technical risks are mostly low category, \nand  recommended  measures  are  expected  to  mitigate  medium  category  financial  and \ngovernance risks.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisk  Mitigating Measure \nProcurement  Advance contracting will be adopted. Training on ADB procurement and consultant recruitment \ndelays  procedures  has  been  carried  out.  Procurement  assistance  is  provided  under  the  project \npreparatory TA and is included in the terms of reference of the implementation consultant.  \nFinancial  ADB direct payment procedures will be used and no imprest account will be established. An \nmanagement  accounting  system  compliant  with  National  Accounting  Standards  will  be  established  and \nand  maintained. The PMU will be supported by international consultants. Training on ADB procedures \nadministrative  will be provided. Recruitment and training of staff for international financing reporting standards \nrisks  will be implemented by Uzbekenergo with the help of the international consultant. \nDelay in  Continuous dialogue will be held between the executing agency and the Ministry of Foreign \ncontract  Economic Relations, Investment, and Trade to ensure that (i) contract registration does not cause \nregistration   unnecessary procurement delays, and (ii) procurement complies with the ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and price verification is not applied. \nCompromised  Project  preparatory  TA  consultants  are  involved  in  the  procurement  and  will  review  the \nprocurement  authenticity  of  proposals.
