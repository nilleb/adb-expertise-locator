The  project  has  three  main  components:  (i)  construction  of  a \n100  megawatt (MW)  photovoltaic2 power  plant  including transmission  and support facilities, (ii) \ninstitutional  capacity  development for  Uzbekenergo,  and (iii)  institutional capacity  development \nfor solar energy stakeholders. \n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nUzbekistan is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive countries in the world,3 both \n3. \nover  six  times  the  world  average,  calling  for  drastic  increases  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable  energy.  Despite  the  huge  potential,  renewable  energy  supplies  less  than  11%  of \ndemand, and only from hydro resources, which are fully tapped. Over 89% of Uzbekistan\u2019s 12.6 \ngigawatts  (GW)  of  installed  capacity  are  aging  carbon-emitting  fossil-based  power  plants,  in \npoor  condition,  and  require  huge  investments  for  replacement  or  rehabilitation.  This  is \nintensified  by  grid  losses  of  about  20%,  which  are  partly  due  to  transmission  over  long \ndistances. The inefficient energy sector emitted 88% of Uzbekistan\u2019s 200 million tons of carbon \ndioxide  equivalent  GHG  emissions  in  2005.4 The  project\u2019s  expected  159  GW  hours  (GWh)  of \nclean  energy  production  will  avoid  about  88,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  emissions \nannually. By supplying electricity where it is consumed, the project will also reduce grid losses. \n \n4. \nWhile  Uzbekistan  is  almost  100%  electrified,  its  aging  and  overloaded  power  system \ncauses  a  supply-demand  gap,  resulting  in  prolonged  and  frequent  outages  especially  in  rural \nareas. This affects quality of life, economic activities, and the delivery of social services. Some \nareas  in  Samarkand  have  grid  electricity  for  only  1-2  hours  in  winter  and  16-18  hours  in \nsummer. Energy supply is further threatened given the country\u2019s depleting fossil-fuel reserves. \nThe  reserve  to  production  ratio  is  10-12  years  for  oil,  28-30  years  for  natural  gas,  and  40-50 \nyears for coal. Continued reliance on gas accelerates its depletion and hampers diversification \nof the energy mix. It also equals lost export revenues, estimated at $900 million for 2012 alone.5  \n \n5. \nWith Uzbekistan\u2019s high solar irradiance and abundant land for solar development, solar \nenergy  is  found  the  most  suitable  sustainable  resource  that  could  quickly  bridge  the  supply-\ndemand  gap,  diversify  the  mix,  and  reduce  emissions.  Recognizing  this,  the  government\u2019s \nWelfare Improvement Strategy II6 mandates accelerated development of indigenous renewable \n\n                                                \n1   The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  In  addition  to  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n\n(TA), a policy advisory TA helped prepare the project. \n\n2  Mono- and poly-crystalline silicon could be proposed by the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, \n\nwho will only need to guarantee the output.  \n\n3  International Energy Agency. 2011. Key World Energy Statistics 2011. Paris. Energy intensity: Total energy supply \nin tons of oil equivalent per gross domestic product (GDP) is 1.97. The world average is 0.31. Carbon intensity is a \nmeasure of how much GHG an economy emits for every dollar of GDP produced, expressed in kilograms of carbon \ndioxide equivalent per GDP. The world average is only 0.73, while Uzbekistan\u2019s is 4.53. \n\n4   Centre  of  Hydrometeorological  Service,  2010.

In  2012,  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  average  purchase  price  was  $1.46  per  million  British  thermal \n\nunits, against the average international wholesale price of $3.24 per million British thermal units. \n\n6  Government of Uzbekistan. 2013. Welfare Improvement Strategy of Uzbekistan II, 2012\u20132015. Tashkent. \n\n\f2 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nenergy, especially solar.  Expertise on the Soviet era solar furnace needs to be enhanced and \nmodern  solar  applications  and  industries  need  to  be  developed.  Thus,  Presidential  Decree \n45127 mandated the creation of advanced solar industries. Uzbekistan\u2019s objective is to become \nthe  region\u2019s  solar  knowledge  and  technology  hub,  and  it  is  targeting  21%  renewable  energy \ncapacity by 2031, with at least 4 GW of solar capacity. The project, being the first of its kind in \nCentral  Asia,  brings  the  needed  demonstration,  technology  transfer,  and  holistic  institutional \ncapacity development for Uzbekenergo and other stakeholders. The government will implement \nthe solar energy development road map8 to achieve a favorable policy framework.  \n \n6.   \nAware  of  the  need,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  helped  Uzbekistan  create  the \nInternational Solar Energy Institute (ISEI) through a capacity development technical assistance \n(TA). 9 ISEI  links  research  with  industry.  Another  ADB  TA  project 10  is  conducting  feasibility \nstudies  for  solar  projects,  including  all  required  due  diligence  for  the  project.  A  project \npreparatory TA (PPTA)11 is assisting in bidding documents preparation and procurement.  \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,12 and  with  the  Energy  Policy  2009.13 \n7. \nThe  project  directly  supports  Uzbekistan\u2019s  clean  energy  and  energy  security  targets  as \nprioritized under the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan14 and is included in \nthe country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan.15 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe plant will be located in the  Samarkand Province of Uzbekistan, 13 kilometers (km) \nsouthwest  of  Samarkand  city,  and  4  km  to  the  north  of  the  regional  center  of  Sazagan.  The \nexpected project impact is improved sustainability of the energy supply in Uzbekistan, and the \nexpected outcome is increased renewable energy generation in Uzbekistan. \n \nC. \n \nThe project will have three main outputs: (i) the construction of a 100 MW16 photovoltaic \n9. \npower  plant  including  transmission  and  support facilities;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  development \nfor Uzbekenergo; and (iii) institutional capacity development for solar energy stakeholders.  \n \n10. \nClean  and  reliable  energy.  The  project  will  construct  a  100  MW  photovoltaic  power \nplant,  a  transmission  line,  and  support  facilities  in  Samarkand  Province.  This  physical \ncomponent is divided into two contracts: (i) a turnkey contract for the engineering, procurement, \nand  construction  (EPC)  of  the  solar  power  plant  including  the  provision  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  services  for  3  years;  and  (ii)  a  contract  for  the  supply  of  goods  for  the \ntransmission line. Uzbekenergo will prepare the site; install the transmission line; and construct \nthe access road, perimeter fence, wells, and raw water supply facilities.  \n                                                \n7  On measures to further promote the development of alternative energy sources, signed 1 March 2013. \n8  Pending final review and acceptance by the government. \n9   ADB.  2011.

The  transmission  line  supply  contract  will  follow \ngovernment procedures since this will be financed by Uzbekenergo.   \n \n19. \nUzbekenergo will recruit an implementation consultant (a firm) in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) to assist the PMU \nin project management and to implement the institutional capacity development plans. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  proposed  photovoltaic  plant  uses  a  proven  technology  based  on  crystalline  or \n20. \npolycrystalline  modules  on  a  fixed  structure,  compatible  with  local  conditions.  The  gross \nestimated output is equal to 159 GWh per year22 measured in the high voltage output terminals \nof the main transformer under standard conditions.23 A 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line will be \nbuilt  to  enable  grid  integration.  A  4-km  access  road  will  be  constructed  from  the  plant  to  the \nexisting road.24 The construction of the proposed photovoltaic plant will take about 18 months. \nGiven  the  executing  agency\u2019s  lack  of  experience  and  knowledge  in  photovoltaic,  the  EPC \ncontractor will continue to operate and maintain the plant for 3 years after being commissioned. \nThe  implementation  consultant  will  assist  in  enhancing  the  O&M  skills  of  Uzbekenergo  during \nthe first year of operation. \n \n21. \nThe  power  plant  primary  energy  source,  solar  irradiation,  has  been  estimated  from  12 \nyears of satellite data and correlated with ground meteorological data to reduce uncertainty. The \npower  plant  will  be  designed,  operated,  and  maintained  to  guarantee  at  least  25  years  of \noperation with a 0.5 % per year degradation on energy output.  \n \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 2010.

The policy and advisory TA consultant \ndeveloped a preliminary design, which is subject to modification by the project preparatory TA consultant and the \ndetailed design of the EPC contractor. The information used to prepare the figures is not contractual. \n\n23 Standard conditions according  to International Electrotechnical Commission 60721-2-1. Standard Test Conditions \nare defined by a module (cell) operating temperature of 25o C (77 oF), and incident solar irradiant level of 1000 Watt \nper  square  meter  and  under  Air  Mass  1.5  spectral  distribution.  The  software  and  model  used  took  into  account \nhourly temperature variations.   \n\n24 Separately,  the  government  will  rehabilitate  the  9-km  road  connecting  the  access  road  to  the  main  road  prior  to \npower plant construction, confirmed by the Samarkand Regional Road Authority to Uzbekenergo on 18 June 2013.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \nThe project is economically viable.25 The economic benefits are incremental as a result \n22. \nof  increased  electricity  consumption.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  16.1%,  which  is \ngreater than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12%). Given the carbon-intensive power \nmix  of  Uzbekistan,  the  project  will  avoid  88,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  GHG \nemissions  in  the  first  year  of  operation  alone.  The  price  of  carbon  reduction  and  the \nenvironmental and health benefits are not considered in the financial and economic analyses.  \n \nThe levelized energy cost26 (LEC) for the overall project is  $0.118 per kWh inclusive of \n23. \ntaxes and $0.079 per kWh exclusive of taxes.27 When the 159 GWh28 generated from the power \nplant is added to the national grid, the overall average cost of generation will increase by 0.5%. \nUzbekenergo is able to absorb this increase in the weighted average cost of generation.  \n \n24. \nUzbekenergo  has  operated  profitably  over  the  last  5  years.  Financial  projections  for \n2013\u20132018  indicate  that  the  financial  base  remains  stable  provided  that  the  tariff  adjustment \nremains  in  sync  with  inflation  and  gas  prices.  The  project\u2019s  capacity  development  program, \naddressing  tariff  policy  and  determination  methods,  among  others,  will  ensure  the  sustained \nprofitability of Uzbekenergo and enhance its capability in the commercial debt market. \n \nC. \n \nUzbekenergo  needs  to  strengthen  its  financial  management  capacity.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s \n25. \naccounting policies, procedures, and financial reporting  have followed the National Accounting \nStandards of Uzbekistan and National Standards on Auditing. However, in order to enhance its \nfinancial  management,  Uzbekenergo  undertook  an  external  audit  based  on  International \nStandards  on  Auditing  issued  by  the  International  Assurance  Auditing  Standards  Board  of  its \nfinancial  statements  from  the  fiscal  year  ending  31  December  2011.  The  results  indicate  the \nneed for further improvements, such as, in the classification methods and impairment provisions \non account receivables, the scope of account consolidation, and the accounting system. For the \nfiscal year ending 31 December 2012, Uzbekenergo has started to adopt International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) conversion with the plan for full conversion to cover all subsidiaries \nfor the fiscal year ending 31 December 2013. The capacity development plan under other ADB \nloan  projects  will  address  the  training  of  the  IFRS  specialists  as  well  as  the  strengthening  of \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  information  systems  with  the  objective  of  improving  its  financial  management \ncapability.29 Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk after mitigation is moderate. \n \n26. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed as average risk. As an institution, it \nhas experience with multilateral and bilateral financing institutions including ADB. However, the \nPMU capacity is weak. The PPTA30 consultant will assist in preparing bidding documents and in \nprocurement. An implementation consultant will be recruited to provide project management and \nsupervision support, and to implement the capacity development component to build executing \nagency  capacity.  Training  on  procurement  and  financial  management  will  be  conducted  by \n\n                                                \n25 The  analysis  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  and \n\nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n\n26 The LEC is the constant price per unit of energy that causes an investment or a payment stream to just break even. \n27 The effective LEC for the solar EPC contract, excluding taxes expected to be exempted, is $0.066 per kWh.  \n28 The expected underated power generation is 159 GWh. The power plant is expected to be derated by 0.5% per \nannum, and this is assumed in the model. The power generation forecasted in 2016 in Uzbekistan is 52,800 GWh.  \n\n29 ADB. 2010.

An  early  warning  system  will  be \nestablished to ensure timely procurement and project implementation. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n27. \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  provide  employment 31  and  will  impact  income  growth  and  poverty \n28. \nreduction  in  Samarkand  district.  Indirect  impacts  on  the  residents\u2019  living  standards  and  well-\nbeing  will  be  significant.32 Power  outages  last  longer  in  rural  areas  compared  to  urban  areas. \nThe households will benefit from reliable access to energy and improved public services, which \nwill improve the economic and social activities of households, and improve living conditions. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nThe  project  will  provide  positive  impacts  through  general  intervention  to  the  poor  and \n\n29. \nvulnerable groups through several channels:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEmployment. Employment and poverty are interrelating indicators. In the project \narea,  most  of  the  household  income  comes  from  employment.  Proper  power \nsupply  service  will  improve  enterprise  operation  and  create  new  business \nopportunities,  which  will  in  turn  improve  the  employment  market  and  lead  to  an \nincrease in income of the population.   \nEducation.  The  household  survey  showed  a  direct  connection  between \neducation  levels  and  poverty.  Educational  services,  which  suffer  greatly  from \nfrequent power interruption, will improve with the enhanced electricity services.  \nHealth. A poor power supply results in poor winter heating and poor health care \nservice,  and  handicaps  the  potable  water  system.  This  leads  to  higher  rates  of \nintestinal  infections  and  cold-related  diseases.  Reducing  bouts  of  disease  will \nreduce  medical  expenses  and  increase  the  economic  activity  of  households, \nincluding those of women. \n\n \n\n30. \nGender.  In  Uzbekistan,  like  in  many  countries,  the  energy  sector  is  male-dominated, \nwith  a  low  representation  of  women  in  decision  making.  Women  occupy  relatively  lower-paid \npositions, have limited training opportunities, and bear the double burden of unpaid household \nresponsibilities.  The  number  of  female  employees  varies  from  2.2%  (Joint  Stock  Company \nSamarkand  Electric  Networks)  to  26%  (Dustlik  Power  Distribution  Networks).  The  gender  and \nto  be  strengthened.  Analyses  of  sex-\ndevelopment  capacity  of  stakeholders  needs \ndisaggregated  data,  information  campaigns,  and  collaboration  with  women\u2019s  organizations, \nschools,  and  technical  colleges  are  needed  to  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  project\u2019s \ncapacity development activities. To address gender issues, the sanitary and hygiene facilities of \nthe power plant need to be improved for both men and women.  \n \n31. \nA  rapid gender  assessment  is  reflected  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nStrategy.33 The  project  will  increase  local  energy  supply,  which  will  improve living  and working \nopportunities,  especially  for  women.  Gender  elements  include  capacity  development  with  a \nspecial focus on women. \n\n                                                \n31 Local labor regulations prohibit exploitive labor practices, including the use of child labor.

The  PMU  and \n\nE. \n \n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  a  category  B  project  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and will involve the construction of a new photovoltaic plant and its supporting \nfacilities, which include an access road and a transmission line.  \n \n33. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) for the construction of the new plant and its \nsupporting facilities was carried out to assess impacts, and the environmental management plan \n(EMP)  was  prepared  to  provide  guidance  for  minimizing  any  adverse  impacts.  Public \nconsultations were carried out on 31 May 2013 in Samarkand city. The IEE report was disclosed \non  the  ADB  website  on  16  September  2013.  The  project  will  not  cause  any  significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  Minor  and  transient  environmental  disturbances  may  occur  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  phases.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  developed  in \nthe EMP, which is subject to updating after the completion of the conceptual system design to \ninclude all technical aspects and to incorporate recommendations from the Samarkand Province \nNature Protection Committee.34 The updated IEE and its EMP will need to be submitted to ADB.  \n \n34. \nThe PMU on behalf of the executing agency has overall responsibility for implementing \nthe  EMP  throughout  project  implementation  and completion. The  contractor  will  implement the \nEMP \nthe \nimplementation  consultant  teams  will  each  have  an  environmental  specialist  to  supervise  the \ncontractor implementing the EMP. A grievance redress mechanism will be established within the \nPMU under Uzbekenergo to resolve complaints, if any. The Uzbekenergo Environment, Health \nand Safety Unit will oversee the implementation of the EMP.  \n \n35. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  will  require  land  acquisition  for  three  types  of \ncomponents:  (i)  construction  of  the  photovoltaic  power  plant,  (ii)  construction  of  the  220-kV \ntransmission line to the national power grid, and (iii) widening of the 4-km access road from the \npower  plant  up  to  the  existing  paved  road.  The  project  is  categorized  as  a  B  project  for \ninvoluntary resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.   \n \n36. \nThe  resettlement  plan,  presented  as  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan \n(LARP), was prepared in close consultation with affected people. The total land to be acquired \nis  410.56  hectares  (ha),  of  which  total  permanent  land  acquisition  is  407.8  ha  and  temporary \nacquisition 2.76 ha. The permanent acquisition will be used for the power plant (405 ha), access \nroad (1.96 ha), and transmission line (0.84 ha). The temporary land acquisition (2.76 ha) will be \nrequired  only  during  construction  of  the  transmission  line.  This  land  acquisition  will  affect  17 \nhouseholds with a total of 109 persons. The land acquisition for the power plant will have three \nhouseholds;  these  households  belong  to  farmers  and  will  be  impacted  severely  because  they \nwill  lose  29.1%  to  41.5%  of  their  productive  land.  The  expansion  of  the  access  road  and  the \ntransmission  line  will  not  cause  any  severe  impact.  None  of  the  three  project  facilities  (power \nplant, access road, and transmission line) will result in any physical displacement of residential \nassets or cause unemployment in affected farms. However, a 675-square-meter structure used \nfor keeping  livestock  and  hay  will  need  to be  demolished  to  construct the power  plant.  During \nconsultation, two of the 17 households expressed willingness to give up land for compensation. \nThey requested appropriate changes in their lease agreements to reduce their tax payments.  \n \n                                                \n34 Under the government environmental impact requirement, the project falls within category 3 and the  updated IEE \nwill  require  clearance  (in  the  form  of  an  opinion  from  ecological  experts)  from  the  Samarkand  Province  Nature \nProtection Committee. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fThe  LARP  for  this  project  was  prepared  in  line  with  national  laws  and  regulations  and \n37. \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The LARP study was carried out from May to July 2013. Six \nconsultations were  carried  out  in  May,  and  three  in July.  The  consultations  were  with  affected \npeople, local government agencies, and local communities. The estimated compensation costs \nfor land acquisition is around $240,000. Uzbekenergo has adequate experience in implementing \na LARP and will be assisted by the PMU. The PMU will include a social safeguards and gender \nspecialist to coordinate with local agencies to implement the LARP and submit reports to ADB. \nThe  established  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  address  both  environmental  and  social \ncomplaints, if any. The LARP was disclosed through the ADB website on 16 September 2013. \n \n38. \nThe survey for poverty and social assessment found that there is no community or group \nin the project area that maintains any particular culture, language, or properties distinct from the \ngeneral  population.  There  are  four  ethnic  groups  within  the  local  community  namely  Uzbeks, \nKazakhs, Russians, and Tajiks. None meet the ADB definition of vulnerable indigenous peoples, \nand therefore the project is categorized as a C project for indigenous people or ethnic minority \nrequirements in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. No further study is needed. \n \n39. \nSafeguards capacity development. Uzbekenergo has experience implementing ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  both  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  However,  as  this  will  be  the  first \nsolar  power  plant  in  the  country,  capacity  development  will  be  provided  to  strengthen \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  capacity  and  to  ensure  adequate  resources  and  institutional  capacity  are  in \nplace  to  manage  environmental  and  social  impacts  associated  with  the  plant.  Capacity \ndevelopment will include a series of awareness campaigns and hands-on practical seminars for \nrelevant agencies and other stakeholders. \n \nF. \n \n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.35 Technical  risks  are  mostly  low  category, \nand  recommended  measures  are  expected  to  mitigate  medium  category  financial  and \ngovernance risks.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisk \nProcurement \ndelays \n\nFinancial \nmanagement \nand \nadministrative \nrisks \nDelay in \ncontract \nregistration  \n\nMitigating Measure \nAdvance  contracting  will  be  adopted.  Training  on  ADB  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment \nprocedures  has  been  carried  out.  Procurement  assistance  is  provided  under  the  project \npreparatory TA and is included in the terms of reference of the implementation consultant.  \nADB  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  and  no  imprest  account  will  be  established.  An \naccounting  system  compliant  with  National  Accounting  Standards  will  be  established  and \nmaintained. The PMU will be supported by international consultants. Training on ADB procedures \nwill  be  provided.  Recruitment  and  training  of  staff  for  international  financing  reporting  standards \nwill be implemented by Uzbekenergo with the help of the international consultant. \nContinuous  dialogue  will  be  held  between  the  executing  agency  and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign \nEconomic Relations, Investment, and Trade to ensure that (i) contract registration does not cause \nunnecessary  procurement  delays,  and  (ii)  procurement  complies  with  the  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and price verification is not applied. \nProject  preparatory  TA  consultants  are  involved  in  the  procurement  and  will  review  the \nauthenticity  of  proposals.
