submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nof up to $25,000,000 or its lari equivalent to Credo Bank JSC (Credo) for Low-Income Housing \nFinance; and (ii) a proposed loan of the lari equivalent of up to $100,000,000 to TBC Bank JSC \n(TBC) for Affordable Mortgage Finance, each, in Georgia. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) to Credo for Enhancing Rural Financial Inclusion for Women in Georgia, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan to Credo, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2. \nThe transactions entail the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing long-term financing \nin lari or United States (US) dollars to Credo and in lari to TBC to support affordable long-term \nhousing  and  mortgage  finance.  While  Credo  will  focus  on  funding  home  renovation  and \nconstruction in rural areas and the periphery of the capital targeting low-income clients, TBC will \nprovide mortgage financing in urban areas benefiting mainly low- to medium-income families. The \nTA will support Credo\u2019s efforts to extend the reach of its banking services to rural clients, with a \nspecific focus on improving financial literacy and access to finance for women. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nGeorgia\u2019s  economy  is  exposed  to  volatility  because  of  its  small  market  size,  high \ndependence on imports of goods and remittances, and fluctuating exports resulting from unstable \ndemand  from  its  neighbors.  Recession  in  Georgia\u2019s  South  Caucasus  neighbors,  the  Russian \nFederation, and Ukraine triggered a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) growth from 4.6% \nin  2014  to  less  than  2.9%  in  2015  and  2016.  The  lari  depreciated  52%  during  October  2014\u2013\nDecember 2016 because of the current account deficit and reduced foreign currency inflows. The \nunemployment rate declined from 16.9% in 2013 to 13.9% in 2017. About 22% of Georgians live \nbelow the national poverty line and many depend on remittances. Women, who earn about 65% \nof  the  average male wage,  have high  representation in the  low-income  segment,  especially  in \nrural Georgia, where women are 56% of the labor force. About 30% of Georgian residents live in \nthe capital, Tbilisi, which generated about 48% of GDP in 2016. Although 70% of Georgians live \nin rural areas and regional towns, agriculture contributed only 9% to GDP in 2017.1  \n \n4. \nGDP growth recovered and reached 5% in 2017, led by trade, tourism, construction, and \ntransport. Improving hydrocarbon prices alleviated pressure on Georgia\u2019s trading partners, and \nexports of goods increased 24%. In addition, workers\u2019 remittances grew 21% and gross foreign \ndirect  investment  inflows  rose  to  12.3%  of  GDP  in  2017.  Despite  the  economic  downturn  in \nTurkey, ADB estimates Georgia\u2019s GDP to grow by 4.9% in 2018 and 5.0% in 2019.2 Although the \nlari  stabilized  in  2017,  dollarization  remains  high,  with  64%  of  bank  liabilities  denominated  in \nforeign  currency.3  Reducing  dollarization  is  critical  for  reducing  market  and  credit  risks,  and \nremains a long-term challenge. Since 2017, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) has mandated \nthe use of lari in economic transactions, increased capital charges for foreign exchange-related \nbanking  transactions  and  exposures,  tightened  credit  exposure  limits  for  unhedged  foreign \n                                                \n1  National Statistics Office of Georgia. 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018 Update: Maintaining Stability Amid Heightened Uncertainty. Manila. \nThe GDP growth estimate considers the adverse impact of the economic downturn in Turkey on Georgia of up to \n0.5% of GDP. \n\n3  National Bank of Georgia (NBG). 2018. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fexchange exposures, and required lari denomination for loan exposures of up to GEL100,000 to \nmitigate credit risk for retail borrowers.4 \n \nHousing  sector.5  Georgia\u2019s  housing  stock  of  634,000  units  consists  of  about \n5. \n400,000 homes  constructed  before  1990.  Built  following  the  former  Soviet  Union\u2019s  standards, \nabout 60% of the windows and doors in such apartments in Tbilisi lack thermal insulation, resulting \nin  energy  consumption  that  is  twice  the  level  of  Eastern  European  countries.  Consequently, \ndemand for new housing and improvements to existing housing are increasing. The housing stock \non the market grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% in Georgia during 2012\u2013\n2017.  The  average  US  dollar  price  per  apartment  in  Tbilisi  dropped  1.9%  during  this  period, \nreflecting a shift in new construction from medium and high cost toward the lower-cost segment.6 \n \nHousing finance availability has improved, as evident in the increase in mortgages and \n6. \ntenors  offered  to  customers.  Outstanding  mortgage  loans  in  US  dollars  during  2012\u20132017 \nincreased  at  a  CAGR  of  21%  to  GEL6.5  billion,  while  the  average  contractual  maturity  during \n2015\u20132017 increased by 12 months to 8.5 years for lari-denominated loans and to 9.8 years for \nUS dollar-denominated loans (footnote 3). With respect to affordability, the shortage of long-term \nlocal currency financing and the absence of a legal and institutional framework to support such \nlong-term capital market instruments as covered bonds limit the affordability of mortgage loans in \nlari for borrowers, especially for young and low-income families. The pricing differential between \nUS  dollar-  and  lari-denominated  loans  remains  high,  at  about  5%  for  comparable  maturities, \nleading many  borrowers  to  opt for  riskier  mortgage funding in  US  dollars.  June  2018  statistics \nfrom TBC, Georgia\u2019s largest mortgage lender, show that the representation of female borrowers \nby income group is concentrated in annual incomes up to GEL50,000 and drops sharply in higher-\nincome groups, reflecting the lower incomes of households led by women. \n \n7. \nFinance sector. Comprising 16 private banks and 83 nonbanks, the finance sector had \nassets totaling GEL36.7 billion or 71% of GDP in 2017, of which banks held 94%. Bank assets \nare concentrated, with TBC and Bank of Georgia accounting for 70%. During 2015\u20132017, bank \nloans  to  the  private  sector  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  17%.  Retail  loans  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  27%, \nrepresenting 47% of bank loans in 2017, which improved the credit risk diversification of banks. \nMortgages made up 28% of bank loans in 2017 and grew at a CAGR of 23% during 2015\u20132017. \nThe  steep  lari\u2013US  dollar  depreciation  during  2014\u20132016  resulted  in declining  deposits growth, \nwell below loan growth. In 2016, dollarization had increased to 65% for loans and 71% for liabilities \nbefore easing in 2017 to 57% for loans and 64% for liabilities (footnote 5), after the NBG measures \ndiscussed in para. 4 were implemented. \n \n8. \nBanking system profitability remained solid, with a return on assets of about 3% during \n2014\u20132017. Although net interest margins were robust, they fell from 5.3% in 2015 to 4.8% in \n2017, indicating increasing competition. Bank liquidity was stable, well exceeding NBG minimum \nrequirements.  Capital  adequacy  ratios  (CAR)  declined  because  of  the  strong  growth  of  risk-\nweighted assets since 2016, but remained sound at about 2% above the NBG minimum. Asset \nquality  has  been  stable  since  2015,  with  nonperforming  loan  (NPL)  ratios  (classified  overdue \n\n                                                \n4  Effective 1 September 2018, the NBG tightened the loan-to-value and payment-to-income (PTI) thresholds for retail \nloan exposures for foreign exchange-denominated exposures to 10% below those for lari-denominated exposures. \n\n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Colliers International, a global real estate services company, defines the low-cost segment in Tbilisi as having a listed \n\nprice of $400\u2013$800 per square meter and the medium-cost segment as having a listed price of $800\u2013$1,200. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fabove 90 days) at 2.8% in 2017.7 Deposits and loans are concentrated, with maturities of less \nthan  12  months,  and  sourcing  long-term  funding  remains  challenging  for  banks.  Georgia\u2019s \nfinancial system has deepened, with the private sector\u2019s credit\u2013GDP ratio increasing from 40% in \n2014  to  59%  in  2017,  exceeding  that  of  its  South  Caucasus  peers  but  still  trailing  the  Baltic \neconomies, Poland, and Turkey. \n \n9. \nSince  2010,  the  NBG  has  carried  out  substantial  reforms  of  its  banking  supervision \nincluding  capital  adequacy  and  liquidity  management  oversight  of  banks.  Lender-of-last-resort \nfacilities  and  internal  capital  adequacy  and  liquidity  assessments  were  augmented  through \nintegrated micro- and macro-prudential supervision. A forward-looking approach guides banks on \nrisk  mitigation  by  adjusting  underwriting  standards  that  show  an  explicit  impact  on  stress  test \nresults. The International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements recognize \nthe NBG\u2019s high standard and consider its innovative approach to be an important benchmark for \nother countries.8 The NBG instituted the Basel III capital adequacy framework in 2018, and three \nsystemically important banks (Bank of Georgia, Liberty Bank, and TBC) will have to build up their \ncapital to meet a minimum CAR of about 17% by 2022 from 13% in 2017.9 \n \n10. \nDuring 2016\u20132017, the average interest rate eased by 90 basis points to 17.3% for lari-\ndenominated loans but dropped by 200 basis points to 8.5% for foreign exchange loans, widening \nthe  differential  between  lari  and  foreign  exchange  loan  interest  rates.  Similarly,  the  average \nmarket interest rate during 2016\u20132017 eased by 140 basis points to 7.2% for lari-denominated \ndeposits and by 120 basis points to 2.5% for foreign currency-denominated deposits, reducing \nthe differential between lari and foreign exchange market interest rates (footnote 3). The high loan \npricing differential reflects currency-induced credit risk as well as higher provisioning and capital \nrequirements, and the high price of lari loans limits the affordability of lari-denominated long-term \nmortgages.  Since  March  2014,  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  including  ADB,  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Finance Corporation, \nhave been issuing lari-denominated bonds.  \n \n11. \nBorrowers identification. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been active \nin  Georgia\u2019s  finance  sector  since  2007  and  has  provided  loans  to  banks  and  nonbanks  that \nprimarily support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including in areas outside Tbilisi. \nWith the growing demand and need for better housing, coupled with the need for longer-term lari \nmortgage financing, ADB selected TBC and Credo based on their strategies in targeting markets \nto  cover  different  income  strata  and  their  willingness  to  offer  longer-tenor  financing.  Both  are \nexisting ADB clients. ADB has developed a close relationship with TBC, providing $50 million in \n2013  that  was  converted  to  lari  in  2015,  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  first  lari  bond  issue,  followed  by \n$100 million  in  2016.10  TBC  has  demonstrated  sound financial  performance,  an  improving  risk \nprofile, and good corporate governance, which led to a premium listing of TBC Bank Group PLC, \na UK based holding company (TBC UK), on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in August 2016. \n\n                                                \n7  NBG.

Manila; and ADB. 2015. \nGeorgia: Financial Inclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth for Credo Microfinance Organization, FINCA Bank \nGeorgia, and TBC Bank. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fTBC  has  a  countrywide  branch  and  multi-sales  channel  network  serving  2.2  million  retail \ncustomers. Its mortgage loan book reached GEL2.0 billion in June 2018, serving nearly 22,000 \nclients,  among  whom  many  are  new  homeowners  in  urban  areas.  TBC  also  had  the  largest \nmortgage  market  coverage  in  the  low-income  segment  (up  to  GEL50,000  per  annum)  with  an \naverage outstanding loan size of GEL71,500 ($27,300) or 60% of its mortgage book in June 2018 \nand women constituted 37% of TBC\u2019s mortgage borrowers in that segment. \n \n12. \nIn  2015,  ADB  built  a  strong  partnership  with  Credo  when  it  provided  a  loan  of  GEL49 \nmillion (footnote 10) and TA to support its transformation from a microfinance lender to a bank. \nFollowing  discussions  with  ADB,  Credo  has  developed  two  mortgage  products  for  low-income \nhouseholds. The products are untested, but Credo has carried out a robust market assessment \namong its clients that forms the basis of its strategy to reach the underserved low-income housing \nfinance segment. In addition to improving living conditions in rural Georgia, Credo\u2019s products will \nsupport the diversification of income generation for low-income households via homestays. The \ntransaction  with  Credo  will  help  improve  outreach  to  rural  women  via  digital  services,  support \nfinancial literacy campaigns, and build the home assets of households led by women. \n \n13. \nLessons  Learned.  ADB  learned from  its  previous  transactions  with TBC  and Credo in \nGeorgia, as well as its operations in the Caucasus and Central Asia, that its provision of loans in \nlocal currency is important to reduce currency-induced credit risk for the target beneficiaries. The \nselection  of  larger  financial  intermediaries  with  a  business  strategy  aligned  to  ADB\u2019s  strategic \nobjectives, as in the case of TBC, has proven to be effective not only for reaching significant target \nbeneficiaries in the SME segment, but also clients for new areas such as affordable housing. The \nselection of a qualified intermediary such as Credo has been effective in developing services to \nbeneficiaries  in remote rural  areas  and  now  will  cater  to  their  growing  housing  finance  needs. \nFinally,  the  long-standing  collaboration  of  ADB  with  NBG  via  sovereign,  non-sovereign,  and \ntreasury operations has facilitated the development of capital markets, especially the provision of \nlocal currency financing. \n \nB. \n \n\nCredo Bank \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n14. \nCredo serves 230,000 borrowers via 66 branches and 1,872 staff as of 2017. Its loan book \nof GEL532 million is well-diversified. With Credo\u2019s large client base and small average loan size \nof GEL2,300, the loan book is highly granular and provides a favorable risk profile. With 46% of \nloans in agriculture, Credo has a strong rural footprint. In March 2017, Credo obtained a banking \nlicense  to  provide  comprehensive  payment,  deposit,  and  lending  services  to  its  clients.  These \nclients are predominantly low-income individuals and farm households\u201451% of which are led by \nwomen\u2014that generate income from farming and business, including agritourism. As a result of \nthe  NBG  policy  of  imposing  lari  for  small  loans  (para.  4),  dollarization  of  Credo\u2019s  loan  book \ndropped substantially from 60% in 2014 to 17% in 2017, while that of its liabilities and equity was \nlimited to 27% in 2017, thereby improving Credo\u2019s and its clients\u2019 currency risk profile. \n \nCredo now plans to launch a product that facilitates the purchase of low-cost housing for \n15. \nlower-income clients in rural towns and the periphery of the capital as well as home renovation \nloans focused on rural areas. It will use its existing staff and cash flow-based credit methodology, \nwhich is well adapted to low-income clients.11 Credo plans to grow its housing loan book to 15% \n\n                                                \n11  Household  income  cash  flows  are  suitable  to  determine  debt  service  capacity  of  low-income  borrowers.  The \n\nestimated net income is used to determine the loan size for the borrower.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fof total loans by 2023. In addition, Credo has identified and trained staff to implement its deposit \nmobilization  strategy  across  Georgia.  The  strategy  is  spearheaded  by  the  head  of  retail,  an \nexperienced banker from Bank Republic with in-depth retail marketing and product experience. \n \n\n2. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \n16. \nEstablished in 1997 by World Vision as a microfinance organization, Credo was purchased \nin October 2014 by a consortium led by Access Microfinance Holding AG (AMH), with a 60.2% \nshare; two microfinance investment funds managed by Triodos Investment Management BV, with \na  19.8%  share;  and  investment  funds  managed  by  responsAbility  Participation  AG  and \nresponsAbility Investments AG, with a 20.0% share. Supported by its founder and shareholders, \nCredo has built a sound credit culture, high integrity standards, responsible finance policies, and \nquality lending services to low-income households in Georgia. \n \nIntegrity and enhanced tax due diligence were conducted.12 No significant or potentially \n17. \nsignificant integrity risks were identified.  After reviewing the transaction, ADB does not believe \nthat Credo has been established or is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, or \ncross-border  tax  evasion.  Credo\u2019s  majority  shareholder,  AMH,  is  owned  by  reputable  IFIs  and \nwell-established philanthropic investors. While AMH recently suffered losses in its AccessBank \nsubsidiaries  in  Tajikistan  and  Azerbaijan,  reflecting  severe  adverse  economic  conditions,  its \nintegrity  remains sound;  its  governance  and management  were  enhanced  in  January  2018  by \nstreamlining  its  supervisory  and  management  boards  and  legally  separating  the  advisory  and \nasset management business of LFS Financial Systems GmbH, AMH\u2019s original sponsor. \n \nCredo is governed by the meeting of shareholders and a two-tier board comprising the \n18. \nboard  of  directors  (BOD)  and  the  board  of  management  (BOM).  The  BOD  oversees  Credo\u2019s \nstrategy  and  operations.  All  current  BOD  members  are  bankers  with  extensive  international \nemerging market banking and BOD experience. Since obtaining its banking license, Credo has \nstreamlined its BOM, which is composed of Zaal Pirtskelava, the chief executive officer (CEO) \nwho has a 20-year record with Credo; the chief financial officer (CFO); and the chief operating \nofficer  (COO).  The  BOM  is  supported  by  an  experienced  management  team  whose  members \nhave  mostly  moved  up  from  being  loan  officers.  In  2016,  Credo  recruited  Irakli  Zatiashvili,  an \nexperienced Georgian commercial banker with a bank supervision background, as CFO. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \nCapital adequacy. Profitable operations resulted in strong retained earnings supporting \n19. \nthe buildup of capital, which reached GEL120 million at a CAGR of 17% during 2015\u20132017. As \nCredo only became a bank in March 2017, it has a short capital adequacy history. In June 2018, \nCredo reported a total CAR of 16.4%, providing a comfortable 3.2% buffer in line with the NBG\u2019s \nnew  capital  adequacy  measurement.  Credo\u2019s  well-diversified  exposure  and  small  size  are \nreflected in the NBG\u2019s capital adequacy requirement for Credo. \n \n20. \nLoan portfolio and asset quality. Credo\u2019s loan book of $205 million equivalent in 2017 \nis well-diversified and quickly liquidating, with an average tenor below 2 years. The loan book has \na  strong  focus  on  agriculture  (46%),  followed  by  services  and  trade  (31%),  retail  (21%),  and \nmanufacturing (2%). So far, retail does not include housing loans.

Manila.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fbook  growth  was  modest  at  a  CAGR  of  5%  during  2015\u20132017,  Credo\u2019s  support  of  the  rural \neconomy remains strong. Loans to households grew strongly since their introduction in 2014 at a \nCAGR of 28% during 2015\u20132017, while services and trade reflect a more mature segment and \ngrew at a CAGR of 14% in the same period. Credo\u2019s credit policy and underwriting practices are \nprudent,  supported  by  rigorous  client  selection  and  monitoring.  Credo\u2019s  asset  quality  remains \nsound, with a 0.9% share of net impaired loans to gross loans in 2017, according to ADB\u2019s NPL \ndefinition.13 Provisioning is conservative, with loan loss reserves representing 169.8% of classified \nloans in 2017. \n \n21. \nEarnings and profitability. Declining market interest rates because of rising competition \nand  the  doubling  of  nonearning  assets  associated  with  NBG  minimum  liquidity  reserve \nrequirements led to a decline of net interest income by GEL6.5 million in 2017, which was only \npartly offset by the increased fee income of GEL3.3 million. As a result, net income dropped to \nGEL20.1 million. A 3.3% return on average assets was still achieved in 2017 and the return on \naverage equity reached 18.4% in the same year. \n \nFunding  and  liquidity.  With  the  banking  license  in  place,  Credo  started  to  mobilize \n22. \ndeposits in June 2018 as described in para.14. Since 2015, Credo has been gradually replacing \nforeign currency through lari funding, which represented 73% of its funding in 2017. Credo plans \nto boost long-term lari funding via term deposits, which are still at very modest levels, as well as \nIFI loans. Credo\u2019s liquidity profile is adequate, with liquid assets accounting for 20% of short-term \nliabilities. \n \nC. \n \n\nTBC Bank \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n23.  With the  acquisition  of  Bank  Republic,  TBC  is  now  Georgia\u2019s  largest  bank  with  market \nshares of 38% for loans and 39% for deposits in 2017. TBC is a systemically important bank. Its \nassets reached GEL12.6 billion in 2017, increasing at a CAGR of 27% since 2011. In the same \nperiod, TBC achieved strong loan growth at a CAGR of 26%, reaching GEL8.6 billion. At the end \nof 2017, micro, SME, retail, and corporate segments made up 68% of its assets, representing a \nstrong  franchise.  TBC\u2019s  unique  strength  lies  in  its  business  sophistication  via  cost-effective \nelectronic  distribution  channels.  With  the  full  integration  of  Bank  Constanta,  a  rural-focused \nmicrofinance  bank,  and  Bank  Republic,  TBC  improved  its  rural  presence  and  maximized \nsynergies for small business lending, while deepening its urban service outreach. TBC\u2019s deposits \nreached GEL7.9 billion and its capital was GEL2.2 billion in 2017. Since 2014, Fitch Ratings has \nkept TBC\u2019s long-term issuer default rating on par with the sovereign rating at BB\u2013, with a positive \noutlook. In 2018, Moody\u2019s Investors Service upgraded TBC\u2019s foreign currency rating to Ba3 and \nits local currency rating to Ba2, both with a stable outlook. With increased competition and depth \nof financial services in Georgia, TBC is preparing to diversify to other regional markets. \n \n\n2. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n \nEstablished  in  1992,  TBC  created  in  May  2016  TBC  UK,  which  owns  99.9%  of  TBC \n24. \nshares, representing 97.26% of TBC UK\u2019s assets and 100% of TBC Insurance JSC, representing \n0.34%  of  TBC  UK\u2019s  assets.  TBC  currently  owns  100%  of  TBC  Kredit  LLC  (TBC  Kredit), \nAzerbaijan, representing 0.26% of TBC UK\u2019s assets as well as eight very small Georgia based \n\n                                                \n13 ADB\u2019s NPL definition includes loans (i) past due more than 90 days; (ii) classified substandard, doubtful, and loss; \n\nand (iii) restructured within 12 months of the reporting date. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fsubsidiaries representing 2.14% of TBC UK\u2019s assets. TBC UK was listed on the LSE premium \nsegment on 4 August 2016. More than 50% of TBC UK\u2019s shares are traded as free float, meeting \nLSE\u2019s  minimum  requirement.  The  two  Georgian  founders,  Badri  Japaridze  and  Mamuka \nKhazaradze, own 20.5%; IFIs reduced their shareholding from 54.0% in 2014 to 11.2% in June \n2018.  Institutional  investors  include  Schroder  Investment  Management  Limited  (8.8%),  J.P. \nMorgan Asset Management (8.8%), Dunross and Co. AB (5.6%), and other undisclosed investors \nwhose  combined  holdings  represent  45.1%  of  share  capital.  With  the  LSE  listing,  TBC\u2019s \ngovernance and management sophistication and systems improved substantially. To ensure that \ntransactions and relationships are kept on an arm\u2019s length basis, on 31 May 2016 TBC UK entered \ninto a relationship agreement with the TBC founders and their affiliates. \n \n25. \nIntegrity and enhanced tax due diligence were conducted. After reviewing the transaction, \nADB does not believe that TBC is being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, or cross-\nborder tax evasion. As TBC UK is listed on the LSE and is subject to the enhanced regulatory \nenvironment  the  United  Kingdom  requires,  the  risks  associated  with  TBC  are  not  considered \nsignificant.  \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\n \n26. \n27. \n28. \n29. \n \n30. \nGovernance structure. The meeting of the shareholders is TBC UK\u2019s supreme governing \nbody. It elects the BOD; sets policy, strategy, and business targets, and appoints and supervises \nthe BOM. TBC UK has nine directors, including the two founders, with Mamuka Khazaradze as \nTBC chair since 1992. Five TBC UK directors are nonexecutive independent directors (all senior \nprofessionals with international banking experience, of which two are female) and two, the CEO \nand the CFO, are TBC executives. TBC has seven directors, which are identical to TBC UK except \nfor the CEO, Vakhtang Butskrikidze, and the CFO, Giorgi Shagidze, who as executives, do not \nqualify as directors under NBG regulations. \n\n \n31. \nIn line with the United Kingdom\u2019s Code of Corporate Governance, listing rules, and NBG \nregulations,  the  BOD  is  supported  by  dedicated  committees  for  (i)  remuneration,  which  is \nresponsible for  BOM  remuneration;  (ii)  corporate  governance  and  nomination,  which  develops \ncorporate governance policies and handles BOM appointments; (iii) audit; and (iv) risks, ethics, \nand compliance, which oversees risk management, including large exposures. TBC executives \nare not represented on BOD committees. \n \n32.  Management.  TBC\u2019s  BOM  is  composed  of  eight  executives:  the  CEO,  the  first  deputy \nCEO,  the  COO,  the  CFO,  the  chief  risk  officer,  and  the  heads  for  retail,  SME,  and  corporate \nbusiness. All are professional bankers who are qualified to lead the bank; four have been with \nTBC for more than 8 years and four have international experience. The BOM sets and reviews \nTBC\u2019s strategy and business targets and prepares TBC policies. The BOM is supported by asset\u2013\nliability management, credit, and operational risk management committees. Business functions \nare separated into corporate, retail, and micro and SME segments. The chief risk officer leads \nrisk management, and legal; the CFO oversees finance, treasury, accounting, and strategy; and \nthe  COO  heads  operations  and  information  technology.  Corporate  business  and  risk  are \ncentralized  at  the  head  office,  while  SME,  micro,  and  retail  relationships  are  managed  at  the \nbranch level. TBC\u2019s organization reflects an adequate separation of business generation and risk \ncontrol. \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n \n33. \nCapital adequacy. TBC increased its capital at a CAGR of 23% during 2015\u20132017, but \nthis was exceeded by the growth of risk-weighted assets (36%) mainly because of the acquisition \nof Bank Republic. The CAR weakened from 16.0% in 2015 to 13.5% in 2017, but is still above \nthe  10.5%  limit.  Beginning  in  2018,  Georgian  banks  must  comply  with  the  NBG\u2019s  new  capital \nadequacy  framework.  As  a  systemically  important  bank,  TBC  will  have  to  gradually  meet  a \nminimum total CAR increase from 16.5% in 2018 to an estimated 17.6% in 2022. The required \nCAR is updated periodically based on TBC\u2019s risk profile set by the NBG. TBC projects that it will \nexceed a CAR of 18% in 2022, well above the required NBG minimum. \n \n34. \nLoan portfolio and asset quality. TBC improved its risk profile by reducing the share of \ncorporate loans from 46% in 2011 to 29% in 2017, while increasing retail loans from 39% to 49% \nand MSME loans from 15% to 22%. Retail loans grew at a CAGR of 31%. Within retail, TBC\u2019s \nmortgage loan book represented 24% of total loans in 2017. Top 20 group exposures made up \n94%  of  corporate  loans  in  2017.  While  significant,  large  exposures  are  diversified  in  different \nareas, including energy and utilities, hospitality, food, telecommunications, real estate, and trade. \nRelated party exposures have been negligible since 2014. \n \n35. \nTBC\u2019s asset quality has improved, with the gross NPL ratio using ADB\u2019s definition falling \nfrom  6.2%  in  2015  to  4.5%  in  2017.  Following  TBC\u2019s  NPL  definition,  NPLs  are  adequately \nprovisioned;  loan  loss  reserves  made  up  81%  of  NPLs  and,  in  addition  to  conservative  loan \ncollateralization, covered 209% of NPLs in 2017. TBC\u2019s retail segment has good asset quality, \nwith reported NPL ratios not exceeding 2.7%. Within retail, the mortgage loan book has the best \nasset quality with an NPL ratio of 2.0% in 2017. As for corporate loans, the NPL ratio is traditionally \nhigher, declining from 7.9% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017, partly because of corporate loan growth. \nThe MSME NPL ratio increased moderately from 4.4% in 2015 to 4.6% in 2017. Overall, TBC has \nmaintained acceptable asset quality. \n \n36. \nEarnings  and  profitability.  TBC  registered  strong  net  income  growth  from  GEL218.7 \nmillion in 2015 to GEL359.9 million in 2017, although increasing competition in the MSME and \nretail segments resulted in a decline of its net interest margin by 199 basis points to 5.9%. Despite \nthe  cost  related  to  the  acquisition  of  Bank  Republic,  TBC\u2019s  streamlined  business  processes \nimproved  the  cost\u2013income  ratio  by  162  basis  points  and  maintained  strong  profitability.  As  a \nresult, the return on average assets of not less than 4.1% and the return on average equity of not \nless than 19.6% were recorded during 2015\u20132017. \n \n37. \nFunding  and  liquidity.  TBC  largely  funds  itself  through  deposits  with  a  contractual \nmaturity of less than 12 months, which covered 71.8% of funding in 2017. Borrowings constituted \nthe remainder of funding. TBC manages its liquidity risk to meet cash flow needs using the liquidity \ncoverage ratio within 12 months. TBC stress tests liquidity coverage weekly and has consistently \nmet NBG minimum liquidity requirements. TBC\u2019s balance sheet is highly dollarized (66% in loans \nand 69% in liabilities in 2017). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nValue Added and Rationale of ADB Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  transactions  will  support  affordable  mortgage  and  home  renovation  financing  for \n38. \nurban  and  rural  dwellers  with  lower  and  medium  incomes.14  The  proposed  ADB  assistance \ncomprises senior loans of (i) up to $25 million or its lari equivalent to Credo with a tenor of up to \n5 years, and (ii) up to the lari equivalent of $100 million to TBC with a tenor of up to 6 years. ADB\u2019s \nassistance also includes a $0.5 million TA to Credo. \n \nB. \n \nThe  proposed  loans  will  be  governed  by  agreements  that  contain  terms  customary  for \n39. \nloans of this nature and amount. ADB will monitor the transactions, providing annual monitoring \nreports  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first  disbursement.  The  banks  will  provide  ADB  with \nfinancial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, including annual \naudited financial statements, quarterly compliance certificates, periodic reports on the sub-loans \nfinanced by the ADB loans, development indicator reports, and TA implementation and impact \nreports from Credo. \n \nC. \n \n40. \nBroadening access to finance. The mortgage market is still nascent in Georgia and long-\nterm funding is needed for home renovation and mortgages. The transactions will considerably \nimprove financing for housing loans and enable access to housing and mortgage funding on a \nbroader  scale  for  lower-  and  middle-income  segments.  ADB\u2019s  long-tenor  funding  will  enable \nCredo and TBC to provide  long-term housing loans to their customers.15 ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department is also working closely with ADB\u2019s Treasury Department to secure long-\nterm lari funding through ADB bonds (depending on market conditions) to help reduce the banks\u2019 \nand sub-borrowers\u2019 exposure to currency risk. \n \n41. \nSupporting  the  buildup  of  a  new  bank.  Credo  has  just  converted  to  a  bank  and  is \nexpanding its product offerings to serve excluded or underbanked segments better. The proposed \nloan will support Credo\u2019s new initiative\u2014a result of ADB\u2019s intensive dialogue with Credo during \nthe preparation of the transaction\u2014to serve lower-income homeowners, thereby helping to reduce \nrural poverty and improve living conditions.  \n \n42. \nImproving financial inclusion for women in rural Georgia. Low rates of land ownership \nand  lower  incomes  impede  women  from  fully  benefiting  from  Georgia\u2019s  improving  banking \nservices  industry,  especially  in  rural  areas.  As  a  bank,  Credo  plans  to  expand  coverage  from \nlending  to  full  banking  services  and  make  special  efforts  to  improve  the  financial  literacy  of \nwomen\u2014moving  from  a  credit-only  approach  to  services  that  include  savings  and  insurance, \nwhich can mitigate the volatility of women\u2019s incomes, especially in rural areas. The attached TA \n(para.  51)  will  support  this  effort.  TBC  also  has  gender-specific  targets  to  facilitate  mortgage \nlending outreach to low-income households led by women.  \n \n\n                                                \n14 Under  the  transactions,  sub-loan  exposures  up  to  GEL100,000  are  eligible  for  Credo  financing  and  sub-loan \n\nexposures up to GEL250,000 are eligible for TBC financing. \n\n15 As noted in para. 32, deposits constitute 71.8% of TBC\u2019s funding with a contractual maturity of less than 12 months. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nD. \n \n43. \n44. \n45. \n46. \n47. \n48. \n49. \n50. \n \nE. \n \n51. \nThe TA will support Credo\u2019s efforts to expand cost-effective services to its rural clients, \nespecially women, and broaden its service offerings beyond lending. The TA is estimated to cost \nup to $1.3 million, of which up to $0.5 million is expected to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Credo will cover the remaining cost of \nthe TA, estimated at $0.8 million. To ensure adequate management, accountability, ownership of \nCredo  over  the  execution  of  services  and  timely  response  to  local  needs  identified  during \nimplementation, the administration (selection and execution) will, as successfully executed in an \nongoing project, be delegated to Credo to be carried out following ADB policies and established \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. The role of ADB will be to monitor the compliance of \nconsultant selection, procurement, and the use of funds with ADB policies, and to track outputs \nfor development effectiveness. Credo will carry out reporting and periodical impact assessments \nof the TA measures, with a special focus on its female beneficiaries. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n52. \nImpact.  The  transactions  will  support  the  government\u2019s  strategy  to  achieve  inclusive \neconomic growth, via improved financial intermediation, broader access to finance and provision \nof mortgage-based instruments. Affordable housing is seen as a key pillar of social security.  \n \n53. \nOutcome.  The  outcomes  for  the  transactions  will  be  that  (i)  the  availability  of  Credo\u2019s \nhousing finance lending to low-income families is sustainably improved; and (ii) the availability of \nTBC\u2019s affordable mortgage lending to low and middle-income families is improved.  \n \n54. \nOutputs. For the transaction with Credo, the outputs are that (i) Credo\u2019s outreach to rural \nfemale customers is improved; (ii) Credo\u2019s capacity for financing mortgages and home renovation \nis  expanded;  and  (iii)  Credo\u2019s  operations,  marketing,  and  tracking  systems  are  more  gender \nequitable.  For  the  transaction  with  TBC,  the  outputs  are  that  (i)  TBC\u2019s  capacity  for  financing \nmortgages  is  expanded;  and  (ii)  TBC\u2019s  marketing  and  tracking  systems  are  more  gender \nequitable. \n \nB. \n \n55. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  proposed  transactions \nsupport the following key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) promoting rural development; and (iii) improving progress \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fin gender  equality  through  the gender  action  plans.16  The two transactions  are  consistent  with \ngovernment  efforts  to  promote  the  well-being  of  its  citizens  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2014\u20132018 for Georgia.17 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB plays a tangible \n56. \nrole in deepening the finance sector in Georgia. Since 2007, it has provided nonsovereign loans \namounting to $255 million and TA to banks (Bank of Georgia, Credo, Finca Bank, and TBC) and \nthe NBG. Bank of Georgia, Basis Bank, and TBC also benefit from ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. \nThe  loans  to  Credo  and  TBC  will  strengthen  the  relationship  with  ADB  further.  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign  efforts  align  with  a  sovereign  program  approved  in  2016  and  a  new  program \nanticipated  for  2019  to  develop  the  capital  markets,  including  the  issuance  of  lari  bonds  and \ncovered bond legislation, among other banking policy reforms.18  \n \n57. \nSupport  for  base  of  the  income  pyramid.  ADB\u2019s  funding  to  Credo  will  help  at  least \n5,000 borrowers, predominantly from the base of the income pyramid (lowest income quantities), \nto access term loans for micro housing and related investments in water and sanitation, thereby \nimproving  their  household  living  conditions.  As  ADB\u2019s  financing  helps  enable  access  to  such \nfinance, the transaction is classified inclusive business. In addition, ADB\u2019s funding to TBC, which \nin June 2018 had 45% of its mortgage loans outstanding and 59% of its mortgage customers in \na  low-income  segment  up to GEL30,000,  has  high  development  impact and  contributes to the \nachievement  of  Sustainable  Development  Goal  10  (reduce  inequality  within  and  among \ncountries). \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n58. \nCategory  FI  (treated  as  C).  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). TBC\u2019s mortgage and Credo\u2019s housing loan and home \nrenovation  activities  to  be  funded  under  the  transactions  have  minimal  or  no  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  The  borrowers  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii) \nexclude  funding by  ADB  of  activities  with  category  A  and B  environment  and social  safeguard \nimpacts;  (iii)  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant \nto  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy;  and  (iv)  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. The borrowers will confirm this in their periodic reports to ADB \nand need not apply any other specific safeguard or social requirements. \n \n59. \nThe  transaction  with  Credo  is  classified  as  having  gender  mainstreaming  as  a  theme \nwhereas  the  transaction  with  TBC  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Following \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  Credo  and  TBC  incorporate  measures  to \npromote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment under the proposed transactions in its \nbusiness activities. Key features of the gender action plans include the targeting of housing loans \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.  2018.
