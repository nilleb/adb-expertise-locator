The  transaction  technical \n1. \nassistance (TA) facility will provide capacity building to projects in Nepal financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The facility will support ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for \nNepal, 2013\uf02d2017, the forthcoming CPS for Nepal, 2020\uf02d2024, and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.1 Given \nthe growth and increasing complexity of ADB\u2019s Nepal portfolio and the country\u2019s transition from a \ncentral  system to  a three-tiered federal  system of governance,  ADB\u2019s  hands-on support for  its \nNepal projects is essential. Hence, a TA facility is proposed to provide systematic and demand-\ndriven  capacity  development  for  project  implementation  and  evaluation,  to  support  tripartite \nportfolio  review  meetings  (TPRMs),  and  to  provide  targeted  capacity  development for  ongoing \nand pipeline projects to improve effective project implementation. The TA facility is included in \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Nepal,  2019\uf02d2021,  which  is  consistent  with  the \nextended  CPS.2 ADB  has  discussed  and  reached  an  agreement  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF) on the purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing plan, and terms \nof references of the TA facility.3 \n \n2. \nPortfolio  growth  and  challenges.  ADB\u2019s  active  portfolio  in  Nepal  as  of  the  end  of \nDecember 2018 stands at $2.8 billion, with 31 loans amounting to $2.5 billion and 18 investment \ngrants totaling $282.0 million. ADB\u2019s annual lending commitment to Nepal averaged $253 million \nannually during 2014\uf02d2016, then increased to $510 million in 2017 and to $592 million in 2018. \nThe forthcoming CPS envisages increasing this figure to about $600 million annually during 2020\u2013\n2024,  with  annual  contract  awards  and  disbursements  increasing  commensurately.  Nepal \ntransitioned to a three-tiered federal system of governance in FY2018, with federal, provincial, \nand local governments entrusted to execute development projects. Increasingly, provincial and \nlocal  governments  will  implement  ADB-funded  projects.  But  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  local \ngovernments suggests that they have limited capacity to meet ADB requirements. As provinces \nare  new  administrative  structures,  capacity  strengthening  is  deemed  particularly  urgent  for \nprovincial governments with no prior experience of engaging with ADB.  \n \nImplementing  the  new  federal  structure  and  sustaining  the  performance  of  its  active \n3. \nportfolio will be challenging for Nepal. Therefore, it is crucial to build the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies of federal, provincial, and local governments. Insufficient capacity affects \nproject  performance  in  procurement,  consultant  recruitment,  contract  management,  financial \nmanagement,  safeguards,  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI),  and  project  monitoring \nand  evaluation.  Furthermore,  during  implementation,  projects  frequently  encounter  problems \nsurrounding  transfer  of  project  directors  and  other  key  project  staff,  so  regular  capacity \ndevelopment support is required. Hiring qualified contractors and consultants has been a problem; \nimproving  the  performance  of  contractors  and  consultants  will  require  effective  procurement \ndesign, regular performance monitoring, and solid control mechanisms. Issues surrounding land \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2013.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Nepal,  2013\u20132017.  Manila.

The  TA  facility  first  appeared  in  the \n\nbusiness opportunities section of ADB website on 28 August 2018.  \n\n3   ADB received the confirmation on 1 July 2019. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nacquisition,  resettlement,  forest  clearance,  and  ensuring  right-of-way  also  hamper  project \nimplementation. Resolving these issues will require improved interministerial coordination.  \n \n4. \nContinued  engagement.  ADB  has  been  addressing  these  challenges  through  the \nCapacity  Development  Resource  Center  (CDRC),  which  was  established  in  the  Nepal \nAdministrative  Staff  College  (NASC)  through  ADB  TA  to  Nepal  for  Enhancing  Portfolio \nPerformance.4 From December 2015 to May 2019, the CDRC delivered 54 training programs to \nmore  than  1,500  executing  and  implementing  agencies  staff  working  on  ADB  projects;  these \ncovered  topics  such  as  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  GESI,  procurement,  consultant \nrecruitment,  contract  management,  financial  and  project  management,  and  preparation  of \nquarterly  project  progress  report.  The  CDRC  conducted  four  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement  clinics.  NASC  and  ADB  identified  the  training  topics  through  a  training  needs \nassessment. NASC and ADB delivered the training programs, ensuring they were locally relevant, \nresource-driven,  and  economical.  The  TA  (footnote  4)  also  supported  the  establishment  of \nTPRMs as an institutional mechanism to address project implementation issues and support the \nsuccessful completion and evaluation of projects. \n \n5. \nThe  TA  facility  will  support  the  continuation  of  demand-led  capacity  development \nprograms, improve the quality of these programs, and continue to support the CDRC as a key \nmechanism  for  delivering  capacity  development  programs.  One  lesson  learned  from  the \nEnhancing  Portfolio  Performance  TA  was  that  identifying  training  needs  for  specific  target \ngroups\u2014for  instance,  new  implementing  agencies  or  senior  officers\u2014yields  better  results. \nTherefore,  the  TA  facility  team  will  (i)  conduct  regular  training  needs  assessments  to  identify \nspecific  capacity  gaps  of  selected  agencies,  (ii)  upgrade  training  materials  through  feedback \nreceived from participants, and (iii) combine field-based training programs and clinic-style issue-\nresolution workshops with classroom training programs. The CDRC will closely coordinate and, \nwhere  feasible,  collaborate  with  ongoing  capacity  development  activities  supported  by  the \ngovernment  and/or  other  development  partners.5 The  CDRC  will  help  establish  pools  of  local \ntrainers  or  resource  persons  in  partnership  with  existing  training  institutes  to  institutionalize \ncapacity  building.  In  addition,  the  TA  facility  will  provide  project  implementation  support  on \nenvironmental  and  safeguard  compliance,  contract  management,  financial  management,  and \nproject management to critical ADB projects. ADB\u2019s Disaster Resilience of Schools Project will be \nsupported with capacity development in quality assurance of school designs, environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  compliance  management,  and  financial  management. 6 The  TA  facility  will \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2014.

The TA is due for closure \n\nin September 2019. \n\n5   For instance, the Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project implemented under a trust fund managed \nby  the  World  Bank,  which  focuses  on  capacity  development  (specifically  targeting  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement)  of  the  Financial  Comptroller  General  Office,  Office  of  the  Auditor  General,  Public  Procurement \nMonitoring Office, and key central and subnational government agencies. Another large project is the Provincial and \nLocal  Governance  Strengthening  Project  which  is  designed  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  sub-national \ngovernments to deliver public services. The project, which aims to start activities in 2020, is financed by the United \nKingdom Department for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Norway, \nthe European Union and United Nations Development Program, together with the Government of Nepal and includes,  \nthe development and strengthening of training centers in each provincial capital. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \nGeneral Administration will implement this project. In addition, the National Planning Commission has, as part of its \nmandate to support planning activities in the three-tiered federal system, prepared guidelines on planning, budgeting, \nand financial management for the subnational level, which can be a resource for capacity development activities. \n6   ADB. 2018.

These  capacity  building  programs  will  cover  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures,  project  implementation,  and  thematic  topics  for  improved  project  portfolio \nperformance, with an emphasis on field-level, clinic-style, issue-resolution workshops, including \nthe  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The TA facility will support \nthe  CDRC  to  develop  training  programs  based  on  capacity  assessments  of  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  and  periodic  training-needs  surveys.  The  topics  covered  will  include \nprocurement,  consultant  selection,  contract  management,  project  management,  safeguards, \nGESI,  financial  management,  and  topics  assessed  from  the  periodic  surveys.  ADB  staff  from \nrelevant ADB departments will be consulted to develop training material and where appropriate \nengaged  as  resource  persons  in  the  capacity  building  programs  to  discuss  international  best \npractices.  The  TA  facility  will  further  enhance  the  online  training  nomination  and  registration \nsystem to improve efficiency on training administration through web-based nominations, selection \nof  participants,  trainee  database,  trainee  tracking,  and  training  logistics  management. \nDevelopment  of  e-learning  modules  for  the  capacity  development  activities  implemented  by \nCDRC, will also be supported. As part of the capacity development activities, the TA facility will \nsupport four business opportunity seminars to disseminate business opportunities to contractors \nand  consultant  organizations  in  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  and/or  other  development \npartners. The CDRC will conduct an impact assessment of training programs and improvements \nin  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  portfolio  results;  this  assessment  will  be  used  to  improve  the \nquality of capacity development. \n \n7. \nOutput 2: Cross-learning in between projects supported. The TA facility will support \ncross-learning between best practices in projects in Nepal as well as cross-learning learning from \nselected,  relevant  international  best  practices.  The  following  sub-outputs  are  proposed:  (i) \nrepresentatives from executing and/or implementing agencies will be invited for at least five field \nvisits  to  project  sites  from  successful  projects  for  hands-on  experience  on  good  project \nmanagement practices; (ii) lessons learned from at least three ADB projects will be documented \nto  facilitate  improved  project  implementation  and  evaluation;  and  (iii)  representatives  from \n                                                 \n\nNepal Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program.
