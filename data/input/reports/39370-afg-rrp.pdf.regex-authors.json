An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \ncompleted,  and  the  summary  of  the  initial  environmental \nexamination is included in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nProject Description  The  proposed  Agriculture  Market  Infrastructure  Project  (the \nProject)  will  deliver  the  following  key  outputs:  (i)  improved \nagricultural  marketing  infrastructure  and  (ii)  improved  product \nstandards and certification systems.  \n \nThe Project will invest in the following livestock processing and \nhorticultural market facilities: (i) two slaughterhouses in Kabul and \nthree in the provinces; (ii) small-scale packing, sorting, grading, \ndrying, and cold storage facilities in horticultural production areas; \nand (iii) laboratories for product certification.  \n \nTechnical  support  will  be  provided  in  the  areas  of  market \ninfrastructure design, product standards, laboratory systems and \ncertification, and produce marketing.  \n \nMinistry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) capacity will \nbe  strengthened  in  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  policy  and \nregulations,  product  standards,  and  agricultural  aspects  of \naccession to the World Trade Organization. \n \nRationale  Agriculture is a key economic driver in Afghanistan. It accounts for \n50% of the gross domestic product and is the major source of \nemployment  and  income  for  most  Afghans.  Livestock  and \nhorticulture are the dominant commercial agricultural areas. While \nAfghanistan has a comparative advantage in these commodities, \ncurrent sector performance is poor. \n \nDuring the long period of conflict and recent droughts, production \nfell dramatically. Productivity and quality standards declined, and \nhigh postharvest losses of 30%\u201340% occurred because of lost \nmarket infrastructure, damage to irrigation systems, and limited \naccess to technical and market services. Lower production and \nproduct quality has reduced export and domestic returns. \n ", "ii   \nThe  destruction  of  livestock  slaughterhouses  has  meant  that \nanimal slaughter is undertaken under unhygienic conditions, with \nresultant poor quality standards and product losses. There are \nserious risks to public health and adverse environmental impacts \nfrom untreated waste.  \n \nInvestments since 2001 have allowed horticultural production to \nincrease, and livestock numbers have risen. While these gains are \nconsiderable under the circumstances, the potential for growth in \nthese industries will be lost without investment in basic market \nfacilities  and  reform  of  the  institutional  regulatory  environment. \nSuch investments need to be undertaken relatively quickly.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The project impact will be increased growth in agriculture. The \noutcome  will  be  more  efficient  livestock  and  horticulture \nagribusiness industries. \n \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost is $31 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties.  \n \nFinancing Plan \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank            30.0    96.8 \nGovernment of Afghanistan              1.0    3.2 \n  Total         31.0    100.0 \n \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation  MAIL will be the Implementing Agency, and laboratory equipment \nArrangements  will be channeled through the Ministry of Commerce and Industries \n(MOCI). The project management office (PMO) will be in MAIL. \nThe PMO will be responsible for procuring civil works, goods and \nservices, and the necessary internal approvals from the Ministry of \nFinance  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  project \ndirector will handle the day-to-day activities of the team. MOCI will \ndesignate a project coordinator for its component. \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n \nProcurement  Goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance civil works, vehicles, \nmaterials, and equipment as described in the procurement plan \n(Appendix  9).  This  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least \nannually, covering the next 18 months of procurement. Advance \naction is required to establish the PMO and recruit key staff. This ", "    iii \nwill help the early preparation of tender documents.  \n \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  finance  81  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  186  person-months  of  national.  The \nrecruitment of a consultant firm will be based on a full technical \nproposal. The quality- and cost-based selection method will be \nused, weighted 90% technical and 10% price. Consultant inputs \nare outlined in Appendix 10. The selection and engagement of \nconsultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide better market facilities and management. \nBeneficiaries  This will cut product losses, raise product standards, and increase \nproduct  competitiveness  in  domestic  and  international  markets. \nThe improved productivity will increase returns to producers and \ntraders,  provide  opportunities  for  developing  value  addition  to \nproducts in Afghanistan, and create employment. These facilities \nwill have significant public health benefits and reduce health and \nenvironmental risks.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Security  remains  the  single  most  important  risk.  Institutional \ncapacity is a constraint, as is the geographic spread of horticulture \ninfrastructure activities across several areas. Should the security \nenvironment change, project locations could be adjusted. \n \nThe  Government  of  Afghanistan  is  committed  to  the  Project. \nImproved  market  infrastructure  will  make  a  big  difference  to \nproducers and businesses. But a risk is their maintenance and \nrepair,  particularly  in  the  case  of  horticulture  facilities.  Careful \nmanagement and supervision by the private companies operating \nthe  slaughterhouses  and  the  farmers\u2019  associations  and \ncooperatives  operating  the  small-scale  horticulture  facilities  will \nreduce some of these risks. While management support will be \nprovided  by  the  Project  to  build  organizational  capacity,  the \nmagnitude of the risk should not be underestimated.  \n \n ", "64o00'E 72o00'E\nAFGHANISTAN\nAGRICULTURE MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE\nTAJIKISTAN\nIMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nUZBEKISTAN PEOPLE'S\nREPUBLIC\nOF\nFaizabad CHINA\nKeleft Hairatan\nJOWZJAN\nTURKMENISTAN Andkhoi Balkh Kholm KONDOZ TAKHAR BADAKHSHAN\nMazar-e-Sharif Kondoz\nSheberghan BALKH Taloqan Eshkashem\n36o00'N Sar-e-Pol Baghlan 36o00'N\nSamangan Pul-eKhomri\nSAMANGAN BAGHLAN\nMaimana\nFARYAB PANJSHIR NURISTAN\nSAR-E-POL Doshi Bazarak\nBADGHIS BAMYAN Charikar MKaAhPmISoAod-e-RaqKiOKNamARdish\nLAGHMAN\nIslamQala Qala-i-Naw Bamyan PARWAN MehtarLam Asadabad\nChaghcharan KABUL Jalalabad\nHerat WARDAK KABUL\nMaidanshahr NANGARHAR\nHERAT Pol-e'Alam Torkham\nKhadir\nGHOR LOGAR PAKTIA\nDAIKONDI Gardez\nIRAN Shindand Ghazni KHOST N\nGHAZNI\nKhost\nORUZGAN Sharan\nTarinKot\nFarah FARAH Mukur PAKTIKA 0 50 100 150 200\nZABOL\n32o00'N Delaram 32o00'N\nKilometers\nQalat\nLashkarGah\nNationalCapital\nKandahar\nProvincialCapital\nCity/Town\nZaranj\nHELMAND\nKANDAHAR Airport\nNIMRUZ\nPAKISTAN NationalRoad\nLanday\nNationalRoad(unpaved)\nKudbar OtherRoad\nRiver\nProvincialBoundary\nInternationalBoundary\nBoundariesarenotnecessarilyauthoritative.\n0\n8\n-3\n5\n18E 64o00'E 72o00'E\nG", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Agriculture Market Infrastructure Project (the \nProject). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  At the request of the Government of Afghanistan (the Government), ADB approved \ntechnical assistance in late 2006 to prepare the Project.1 The project design and monitoring \nframework is included in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Agriculture accounts for half of Afghanistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). It is the key \ndriver of sustainable economic growth and employment generation.2 Commercial agriculture3 in \nAfghanistan is dominated by horticulture and livestock, with product sales in domestic and \nexport  markets.  Afghanistan  has  enjoyed  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  commodities, \nsupplying 20% of the global market for raisins in the late 1970s, dominating the world pistachio \nmarket, and supplying livestock and wool products regionally. During the long period of conflict \nand  severe  droughts  of  the  late  1990s,  the  production  of  all  commodities  fell  drastically. \nProductivity and product quality standards declined, and high postharvest losses of 30%\u201340% \noccurred because of lost market infrastructure, damaged irrigation systems, and limited access \nto technical and market support. While considerable investment has been made in production \nsince 2001, agricultural growth potential will not be achieved without investment in basic market \ninfrastructure and reform of the institutional regulatory environment.  \n \n4.  Livestock.  This  is  integral  to  all  farming  systems  in  Afghanistan. 4  After  falling \ndramatically in the late 1990s, livestock numbers have increased since early 2001.5 While \nproduction is increasing, Afghanistan still imports live animals for meat, frozen meat including \nchicken,  eggs,  and  wool.  The  meat  industry  is  large,  with  the  indicative  value  of  meat \nconsumption in Afghanistan per year at $800 million and with the capital value of livestock \nassets estimated at $3 billion. Most inedible products of animal origin are exported after first-\nstage  processing  (salting  and  washing  skin,  hides,  and  intestines  [casings];  dehairing  for \ncashmere; and washing and cutting carpets) or without any processing at all (wool for spinning). \nCarpets  are  an  important  export  that  accounted  in  2006  for  an  estimated  $180  million  of \nexports.6  \n \n5.  Horticulture.  Dried  fruits  and  nuts  and  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  have  played  a \ndominant role in Afghanistan exports. The horticulture area has expanded since 2001, totaling in \n2005 approximately 122,000 hectares (ha), with perennial nut crops totaling 12,000 ha and fruit \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Commercial Agriculture Development Project. Manila (approved \nfor $995,000 on 23 November).  \n2 The rural economy is the major source of employment and income for most Afghans, as nearly 80% of the \npopulation, or 19 million people, live in impoverished rural areas. \n3  While wheat accounts for over two-thirds of cultivated area, it is typically a subsistence crop.  \n4  Agricultural and pasture areas account for 45% of land area. \n5  The Food and Agriculture Organization 2003 census estimates cattle at 4 million, sheep 9 million (still far below the \ncensus number in the 1980s to early 1990s of 19 million), goats 7.3 million, and poultry 12 million. These are \nunderestimates,  especially  for  sheep  and  goats,  as  the  livestock  of  nomadic  kuchis,  which  accounts  for \napproximately 30% of total sheep and goat numbers, was not included. \n6  The Government estimate is conservative, as industry estimates are significantly higher.  \n ", "2   \ntrees 106,000 ha, of which grapes occupied 58,000 ha, apricots 8,000 ha, berries 9,000 ha, and \nfigs 7,000 ha. Nurseries\u2019 current sales of nut and fruit seedlings indicate an expansion of area \nby 12,000 ha per year. Domestic demand for fresh fruits and vegetables is strong, as is export \ndemand for key commodities. In 2006, the value of exports was $70 million for fresh fruits and \n$111 million for dried fruits and nuts. Experts have estimated that, if productivity and quality can \nbe improved, the sector can contribute $1.5 billion in exports in 10 years.7 The Government\u2019s \nlower target is $250 million by 2015.  \n \n6.  Opium Economy. Illegal opium production has expanded since 2001. While accounting \nfor only 3% of the total cultivated area, opium has become a major cash crop for a significant \nnumber of households. In 2006, it was valued at $3 billion, equivalent to 46% of the country\u2019s \nlegal GDP. Opium is a labor-intensive crop, with an estimated 2 million people involved in its \nproduction. The expanding opium economy has harmed the Government\u2019s state-building and \nsecurity efforts, and it finances corrupt practices in key production areas. While the existing \ngovernment  counter-narcotics  strategy  and  alternative  livelihood  programs  may  require \nmodification to be more effective in controlling opium production, a key element of any program \nis  producers\u2019  access  to  alternative  cash  crops  and  markets  in  a  secure  environment  with \neffective enforcement.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Market Infrastructure and Regulatory Environment \n \n7.  Economic growth and market development in commercial livestock and horticulture is \nlimited by inefficient commodity market chains that cause heavy product loss and poor product \nquality and lacks the product certification necessary for access to export markets. The key \nconstraints  are  poor  and  fragmented  market  infrastructure  for  livestock  and  horticulture \nproducts, with limited and inadequate commodity collection, storage, packing, and processing \nfacilities; inadequate access to improved postharvest and processing technologies; and the lack \nof product standards. Private sector investment is low because of risk in the current business \nand  security  environment  and  limited  access  to  finance  for  infrastructure  investments,  in \nparticular for agribusinesses. A regulatory environment is slowly developing for meat inspection, \nincluding trained inspectors, and for public hygiene and animal health. Nonetheless, regulation \nis lacking in terms of recognized product quality and certification processes for the export of \nhorticultural products and of legislation to secure transactions and leasing for financial sector \ndevelopment. The project problem tree is in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Livestock and Horticulture Productivity and Product Quality \n \n8.  Livestock. Improving the livestock value chain will have positive economic and public \nhealth benefits. Currently the main livestock products (meat, hides, skins, casings, and wool) \nsuffer low productivity and quality, with limited value addition. While livestock production is \nexpanding, dairy production is rising from a low base, and the established carpet industry \nundertakes the key value-adding stages of cutting and washing carpets and wool in Pakistan. \nAddressing constraints will require (i) establishing market infrastructure for livestock products \n(slaughterhouses; facilities for such by-products as hides, skins, and casings; dairy plants; and \nlivestock markets); (ii) improving the quality of livestock products through compliance with food \nsafety  requirements;  and  (iii)  developing  further  value  addition  to  local  products  and \nstrengthening animal production and animal health technical services.  \n                                                 \n7  The OTF Group. 2006. Strategy and Action Plan for Afghanistan\u2019s Dried Fruit and Nuts Cluster. USAID.  ", "    3 \n9.  The meat industry in Afghanistan is large. An estimated 1 million cattle and buffaloes \nand 5 million sheep and goats are slaughtered in the country per year, with Kabul accounting for \n24%  of  the  former  and  20%  of  the  latter.  With  slaughterhouses  destroyed  in  the  conflict, \nbutchers have no option but to slaughter livestock in makeshift areas such as urban backyards. \nKabul and major provincial cities have no slaughtering facilities or very basic ones, such as \ncement slabs.8   \n \n10.  The  Government  has  prioritized  establishing  hygienic  slaughter  facilities  to  reduce \nwaste, mitigate public health risks, and improve the hygienic quality of the meat. Retail butchers \ncurrently get meat by slaughtering their own animals or from wholesalers who supply a number \nof retailers. While the standard of the retail outlets varies, there is demand for improving the \nquality of meat from consumers with rising incomes, and some butchers have established \nimproved retail outlets with cool storage to try to meet this demand. Supermarkets are also \nselling better quality fresh and frozen meat.  \n \n11.  The construction of slaughterhouses and ancillary facilities would provide (i) critical \ninfrastructure for developing professional meat production and processing systems and (ii) a \nfocus for increasingly adding value to meat and livestock by-products. Chilling facilities would \nimprove meat storage, enable the development of meat deboning and packaging systems, and \nprovide opportunities for the expanded marketing of high-quality meat products in the growing \nurban  supermarket  trade.  The  increased  volume  of  hides,  skins,  and  intestines\u2014in  better \ncondition than under the existing traditional slaughter system\u2014and the by-product processing \nfacilities operating on the same site would ensure quicker processing and higher-value by-\nproducts for export. Existing hide and skin associations and traders could potentially undertake \nfurther processing of these products in Afghanistan before exporting them to Pakistan and other \nregional markets. Utilizing waste materials as commercial products will be possible with the \ncollection of blood for processing into blood meal for use in the emerging poultry feed industry. \nSlaughterhouses\u2019 carcass delivery system to butchers could be combined with a bone-collecting \nservice so that a bone meal facility on site would have raw material. \n \n12.  As the Government progressively reestablishes a functioning regulatory environment for \nanimal health and meat quality, there will be increased incentive for slaughterhouse killing. The \nGovernment is already developing a regulatory environment for public hygiene, environmental \nmitigation measures,  and  animal  health.  This  indicates that,  in  the  short  to  medium  term, \nbutchers will incrementally have to shift to slaughtering under controlled, hygienic conditions. \n \n13.  Horticulture.  Afghanistan has a significant global comparative advantage in raisins, \nother dried fruit and vegetables, fresh fruits, and nuts. (An analysis of the commodity market is \nprovided  in  Appendix  3.)  However,  horticultural  products  are  currently  produced  in  low-\nproductivity  systems  with  poor  product  quality  and  grading  and  high  postharvest  losses. \nAddressing  these  constraints  will  require  improved  harvest  and  postharvest  practices; \ninvestment in infrastructure for storage, packing and cold storage, processing, and product \nquality; improved planting material; and access to technology and management services. The \nsmall-scale farmers who dominate production will benefit from establishing and strengthening \nfarmers\u2019 associations, which will improve market opportunities. \n \n14.  While producers invest in the production base, the incentives to develop market facilities \nand  improve  the  quality  of  export  products  is  constrained  by  traders\u2019,  processors\u2019,  and \nexporters\u2019 following a low-risk investment approach. This results in high postharvest losses and \n                                                 \n8 The only proper slaughterhouse in Kabul is in the Ministry of Defense and was constructed in the early 1940s. ", "4   \nthe sale of products based on industry standards rather than certified. Both the Government and \nthe  private  sector  recognize  the  urgent  need  to  improve  the  regulatory  environment  and \ncertification systems. This would bring higher economic returns and enable the private sector to \nexpand directly into higher-value markets, rather than indirectly through using an intermediary \ncountry as the country of origin. The incentive for implementing such a change is the financial \nbenefit for private businesses to collectively improve product standards and certification. It \nwould be an incremental process.  \n \n3.  Financial Sector \n \n15.  Financial sector operations in Afghanistan are relatively new, and financial institutions \nhave yet to reestablish a strong investment lending product range or portfolio. The banking \nsector has focused on trade and short-term interest financing, though in late 2007 some small \nand medium-sized enterprise lending began. Currently, the geographic network of coverage is \nlimited.  Additional  financial  sector  constraints  include  the  lack  of  access  to  funds  and  an \nincreasing  risk  premium  for  private  sector  investments  in  the  current  environment.  Secure \ntransaction  and  leasing  legislation  is  being  prepared  and,  once  approved,  will  remove  a \nregulatory constraint and facilitate growth in leasing.  \n \n16.  Given  the  constraints  and  the  failure  of  financial  institutions  to  provide  investment \nproducts, other options to support market infrastructure investments are required, as these \ninvestments  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits  and  growth.  Investments  using  public-\nprivate partnerships are assessed as commercially viable and provide a feasible alternative.  \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n17.  Existing development partners\u2019 projects have focused on developing and expanding \nhorticultural and livestock production in targeted areas. ADB, the European Commission (EC), \nand the World Bank are undertaking a number of irrigation and water resource projects that are \nexpanding the production base for horticultural enterprises and, to a more limited extent, the \nopportunity  to  expand  livestock  production.  Currently,  few  development  partners  support \nagribusiness market development. The United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) has engaged in market development projects with the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, \nand Livestock (MAIL), with pilot activities and infrastructure such as farmer association cold \nstores, storage, and export marketing to facilitate exports and market growth. A key priority is to \ncomplement these activities with support for further market-based development. A summary list \nof development partners\u2019 projects is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The World Bank is undertaking a horticulture and livestock project to improve production \nquality  with  technical  services  in  the  central  and  northern  regions,  and  a  dairy  is  to  be \nestablished in the Kabul region. The Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom (DFID) and USAID projects work in the eastern and southern regions with a range of \nprojects, some of which include alternative livelihoods and livestock products, including carpets \nand fresh horticultural exports. The Rural Business Support Project of ADB and the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction started in late 2007 with the plan to strengthen the commodity value chain \nfor wool and carpets, including cutting and washing facilities, and for vegetable oil processing \nand potato storage in selected districts of three provinces. The EC has an animal health project \nwith MAIL to develop capacity and laboratories for animal health testing, setting regulations, and \ninspection services, and to establish veterinary field clinics for the delivery of services. The \nAfghanistan  Rural  Enterprise  Development  Program,  piloted  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nReconstruction and Development, will focus on establishing and strengthening industry and ", "    5 \nproducers\u2019 associations and enterprise groups, as well as savings and credit groups to support \nrural enterprise development.  \n \n19.  High postharvest losses, poor quality, and the lack of product certification result in low \nproductivity  and  returns  for  livestock  and  horticultural  products.  These  problems  would  be \nresolved with strategic market investments, an improved regulatory environment, and easier \naccess to markets. This is particularly important given the growth in livestock numbers and \nexpansion in horticultural production. Further, linking these developments with some existing \nprojects would be possible, as would working with producers and agribusinesses in the project \nareas to develop infrastructure as the next step in improving commodity productivity, quality, \nand value addition. \n \n5.  Government Strategy \n \n20.  The  Government\u2019s  agriculture  sector  master  plan  and  the  Afghanistan  National \nDevelopment Strategy (ANDS, 2008) detail opportunities for growth and value adding in core \nagricultural  commodities  in  the  horticulture  and  livestock  subsector,  including  the  need  to \ndevelop a market-based regulatory environment with access to inputs, services, and markets. \nMAIL is establishing the regulatory environment and building capacity to undertake the required \ncertification and product quality assessment, and it has removed previous barriers to private \nsector enterprise. In its 1387 (2008/2009)9 development budget submission to the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), MAIL identified establishing and operating slaughterhouses as a priority to \nimprove livestock enterprise returns from meat and such animal products as hides and casings \nand to reduce problems regarding urban environmental waste and public health risks associated \nwith existing slaughter systems.  \n \n6.  ADB Strategy \n \n21.  The ADB draft country partnership strategy (CPS) for Afghanistan (2009\u20132012)10 is \naligned  with  the  ADB  long-term  strategic  framework  (Strategy  2020)11 and  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s ANDS priorities. The draft CPS continues the ADB focus on three priority sectors, \nwith  infrastructure  investment  and  reforms  planned  in  (i)  irrigation  and  water  resource \nmanagement and agricultural market infrastructure; (ii) power generation, transmission, and \ndistribution; and (iii) transport and communications, with national road and communication links \nto neighboring countries. ADB support will improve agricultural growth and productivity by (i) \nrehabilitating  and  developing  new  irrigation  and  water  resource  infrastructure,  with  the \nassociated  expansion  and  improvement  in  enterprise  returns;  (ii)  developing  market-based \nagriculture  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  creating  an  enabling  regulatory  environment  to  facilitate \ngrowth in the sector.  \n \n22.  The  proposed  Project  will  undertake  agricultural  market  infrastructure  investments, \nwhich will generate inclusive economic growth. It supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020. The investments will improve environmental management and the mitigation of adverse \nimpacts from the lack of infrastructure in cities. The effectiveness of these interventions will be \nsupported by other ADB infrastructure activities that provide improved access to irrigation, \npower, and road transport. The proposed Project is included in the CPS for 2008. \n \n                                                 \n9  Financial year 1387 is from 21 March 2008 to 20 March 2009. \n10 To be submitted to ADB Board of Directors for approval in early 2009. \n11 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "6   \n7.  Lessons  \n \n23.  Afghanistan\u2019s  agriculture  sector  and  rural  economy  are  characterized  by  weak \ninstitutions;  large  numbers  of  poor,  small  producers;  production  and  marketing  through \ntraditional, largely informal systems with little value added; and lightly mechanized, family-based \nbusinesses. Given the wider security issues and limited access to finance, interventions must \ntarget  priority  commodities;  support  critical  gaps  in  the  value  chain;  and  demonstrate  that \nproducers,  traders,  and  processors  can  effectively  respond  to  demands  in  the  domestic, \nregional, and wider export markets.  \n \n24.  Experience garnered from interventions in the sector and the region indicates that, in \nemerging  and  post-conflict  economies,  where  institutional,  technical,  policy,  and  financial \nconstraints exist, a comprehensive approach is required. Government can play a key role as a \nfacilitator  for  market  development,  with  the  direct  provision  of  services  undertaken  by  the \nemerging private sector. Regulatory support and stimulation of business services in such an \nenvironment is effective and generates economic growth. Improving the provision of business \nservices in such environments often requires time-bound, cost-sharing grant arrangements that \nassist  enterprise  development  and  improve  the  quality  of  agribusiness  service  provision. \nPositive outcomes are achieved by helping to remove barriers to establishing enterprises and \nadopting new technologies and practices. Interventions must be targeted and implemented \neffectively, with defined timelines for achieving cost recovery.  \n \n25.  To address current capacity constraints and the limited availability of professional and \ntechnical  expertise,  project  interventions  will  need  to  use  an  incremental  approach  toward \ndeveloping  stronger  supply  chains  and  market  systems  and  assisting  in  strengthening \nproducers\u2019  and  traders\u2019  associations  and  institutions  that  will  be  able  to  facilitate  service \ndelivery. Developing the capacity of private sector providers and establishing a functioning \nregulatory capacity will be critical. The steps involved will be incremental, building on existing \nstructures  where  feasible,  strengthening  and  using  local  associations  and  institutions,  and \nkeeping activities targeted by commodity and area. For effective implementation, projects need \nstraightforward administrative arrangements. In the light of capacity constraints, the number of \nprocurement packages should be kept to a minimum.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n26.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  increased  agricultural  growth.  The  outcome  is  the \ndevelopment of more efficient livestock and horticulture agribusinesses.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n27.  The proposed Project will achieve the following outputs: improved agricultural marketing \ninfrastructure  with  investment  in  slaughterhouses,  small-scale  horticulture  market  facilities, \nlaboratories to certify products, and improved standards for horticultural products and product \nmanagement systems.  \n \n1.  Improved Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure  \n \n28.  The  proposed  Project  will  undertake  livestock  and  horticulture  market  infrastructure \ninvestments and provide support to improve the commercial operation of facilities, including the \nadoption of improved postharvest technologies and marketing practices. Slaughterhouses will ", "    7 \nbe constructed in Kabul and three provincial centers. Small-scale horticulture collection and \nstorage facilities will be established in production areas in each of the seven regions of the \ncountry.  Commodity  certification  laboratories  will  be  developed  and  improved.  These \ninvestments will address critical gaps affecting productivity, product quality, market access, and \ndemand in domestic and regional markets.  \n \na.  Slaughterhouses \n \n29.  The proposed Project will establish five slaughterhouses with supporting facilities for \nholding livestock and managing such by-products as hides, skins and casings12 and wastes. \nTwo will be in Kabul and the other three in the provincial cities of Herat, Kundus, and Mazar. \nMarket analysis of the livestock industry indicates demand for slaughterhouses in a number of \nmajor regional centers. Locations were selected based on criteria including livestock production \nand market demand, technical factors including environmental parameters and site availability, \nfinancial and economic viability, and institutional and operational sustainability. Appendix 5 \nprovides details on the selection criteria. \n \n30.  The slaughterhouses will be constructed using a modular design on MAIL-owned land, \nwith long-term management and operation to be undertaken by the private entities. Each facility \nwill  require  a  site  of  approximately  2.5  ha  and  will  provide  space  for  livestock  holding, \ninspection, and slaughter; the initial treatment of hides, skins, and casings; the storage and \ndisposal of solid organic waste; and the treatment and disposal of wastewater.  \n \n31.  The  slaughterhouse  design  is  for  a  facility  with  the  capacity  to  process  100  large \nruminants and 500 small ruminants per single shift, operating for 30 days per month. This will \nproduce 900 million kilograms of red meat per month, or 10,800 million kilograms per year. The \nexpected throughput of one slaughterhouse equals 15% of the large ruminant slaughter, and \n18% of the small ruminant slaughter, in Kabul per year. The facilities will have the potential to \nincrease throughput with additional shifts. Using a modern facility that centralizes slaughter will \nfacilitate pre- and postmortem inspection; add value by saving blood; and produce higher-quality \nhides, skins, and intestines for further processing.  \n \n32.  The slaughterhouse preliminary designs\u2014including site preparation, water treatment, \nwaste management, and utilities; their costing; and their private management structures\u2014have \nbeen prepared. The final design and preparation of tender documents will be completed by \nDecember 2008. This will enable the tender process to be undertaken at the start of 2009. A \nturnkey contract is proposed for the facilities, which will be tendered as a single contract. A \n1-year  support  component  for  management  will  be  included  in  the  contract  for  the \nslaughterhouses to ensure their adoption of modern hygienic practices and standards.  \n \n33.  The slaughterhouses will operate as public-private partnerships. The initial investment \nwill be with public funds, but the management and operation of the structures will be contracted \nout to the private sector, with the Government\u2019s expectation that ownership of the facilities will \neventually  be  transferred  to  the  private  entities.  The  investment  model  is  infrastructure \ninvestment by Government, with the assets transferred, operated, and managed under long-\nterm arrangements by private entities.  \n \n34.  It is proposed that a tender be undertaken for selecting the private entity to manage and \noperate each facility prior to construction. The contract for management and operation will be \noffered with two options: (i) a long-term lease-to-purchase contract or a long-term lease for \n                                                 \n12 Intestines used as meat casings for sausages and other processed meat products. ", "8   \nmanagement. The lease term is expected to be 15 years, with options for renewal after 5 years. \nThe criteria for selecting private entities will include previous business experience, especially in \nmeat and livestock or related sectors; company equity and financial management capacity \nconfirmed with due diligence; management skills and the proposed business plan for managing \nand operating the facility, including provisions for undertaking the contract slaughter of livestock; \nand the type of lease contract requested. Discussions with private entities in the proposed \nlocations have indicated that a number of established companies with relevant experience \nwould be interested in tendering for operating, managing, and eventually owning such facilities. \nThe contract lease payments will be paid into the MOF single treasury account and used for \ninvestment in agriculture. \n \n35.  The  slaughterhouse  investment  will  improve  the  quality  of  meat  and  by-products, \nincrease product returns, and provide a framework for developing enterprises to add value to \nproducts. There will be significant public health and environmental benefits, as the current \npractice of slaughtering livestock on city lots and streets poses a major public health risk. \n \n  b.  Farm-Level Collection and Marketing Facilities \n \n36.  The proposed Project will establish small-scale horticulture infrastructure investments \nthat will include commodity collecting, sorting, and grading centers; drying facilities; and packing \nhouses  and  small  cold  storage  facilities  in  production  areas.  These  investments  will  be \nundertaken with farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives. They will have a catalytic \nrole,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be  achieved  through  improved  postharvest \nhandling and marketing and the benefits of strengthening linkages between producer groups \nand traders. The project-financed infrastructure investments are expected to range in cost from \napproximately $20,000 to $75,000 equivalent. The facilities will be constructed on MAIL-owned \nland and managed and operated by farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives.  \n \n37.  This investment will support sector growth, as private sector and financial institution \nengagement in agribusiness infrastructure, especially in those investments that involve farmer \norganizations,  is  currently  very  limited.  Given  the  expanding  production  base  and  large \ninvestments in irrigation infrastructure underway, demand for such facilities is increasing. \n  \n38.  The investments will be selected based on (i) prioritized commodities in key production \nareas; (ii) technical and financial viability; (iii) the institutional and operational sustainability of \nthe facility, including the capacity of the farmers\u2019 organizations; and (iv) integration with other \nproject activities. Appendix 5 provides details on the selection criteria. Approximately 200 small-\nscale market investments are included. The investment model is infrastructure investment by \nGovernment, with the assets operated and managed under long-term arrangements by farmers\u2019 \nand producers\u2019 groups and cooperatives. The Government expects ownership of the facilities to \nbe transferred to these producers\u2019 groups. Standard designs will be developed for the different \ntypes of small-scale infrastructure. Project support will be provided to facilitate their adoption of \nimproved postharvest technologies and marketing practices and for strengthening management \nand operation. \n  \n39.  The  commodity  market  chain  assessment  undertaken  during  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance will be reviewed in the first year of the Project. The outcome will be used to \nconfirm the priority areas for supporting value chains and the geographic areas within each \nproduction region to be targeted, to develop a critical mass or cluster of participating farmers\u2019 \nassociations  and  strengthen  linkages  with  traders  and  processors.  The  reassessment  will \nenable further specification of the small-scale infrastructure investment requirements and the ", "    9 \nassociated postharvest technology, management, and operational support required, as well as \ntraining needs. The project consultants and staff undertaking the review in the seven regions will \nlink closely with the provincial MAIL, farmers and associations, the Afghanistan Chamber of \nCommerce  and  Industry,  and  agribusinesses.  A  single  contract  will  be  tendered  for  the \nconstruction of all the small-scale facilities. \n \n40.  The collection and market facilities will, at minimum, add further value to dried fruits and \nnuts by improving product quality, processing, packaging, and marketing and increase the value \nof fresh fruits and vegetables by improving storage, handling, and marketing.  \n   \nc.  Product Standards Laboratories \n \n41.  The Project will assist the Government in strengthening institutions\u2019 capacity to develop \nstandards and regulations for improved product quality, which will support sector growth and \nagricultural  trade.  This  will  involve  establishing  certified  laboratories;  strengthening  MAIL\u2019s \ncapacity regarding sanitary and phytosanitary policy and regulatory issues; and establishing \nproduct standards, particularly as part of MAIL\u2019s role as a member of Codex Alimentarius and in \nvarious agricultural policy aspects of Afghanistan\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \n(WTO). The specialist technical input required for these activities is included under the project \nmanagement and capacity-support component. \n \n42.  Fresh and dried fruits and nuts for export must be certified by the Raisin and Other Dried \nFruit Export Institute under the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MOCI). This institute \noperates three laboratories, two of which\u2014in Kabul and Kandahar\u2014have received equipment \nand some training from development partners. To make these laboratories fully operational, the \nProject will provide targeted support for laboratory system management and technical training, \nas well as equipment for the third laboratory, in Mazar. A key additional piece of equipment, a \nhigh-performance liquid chromatograph, will be supplied to the Kabul laboratory. Support will be \nprovided for international accreditation.  \n \n43.  While regional markets accept these Afghan products according on industry standards, \nthe  current  certificate  is  not  recognized  by  importing  countries,  as  the  laboratories  lack \ninternational accreditation. Obtaining such accreditation requires 3 years of quality control by \nthe laboratories. Developing cost-recovery systems will be an important element of laboratory \nsystem  management.  Adopting  improved  product  quality  standards  will  require  raising  the \nawareness of farmers\u2019 groups and trade and industry associations, training them, and providing \nlinkages to the export promotion authority to ensure that they receive the financial benefits that \naccrue from these changes.  \n \n44.  Project  outcomes  will  be  a  strengthened  regulatory  environment  and  improved  and \neffective sanitary and phytosanitary policies that safeguard the consumer while promoting high-\nquality products. Adopting grades and standards, upgrading laboratories that test dried fruits \nand nuts, and generally improving industrial food safety practices will open to dried fruit and nut \nprocessors and exporters more lucrative markets for their certified products.  \n \n2.   Effective Project Management and Capacity Support \n \n45.  A project management office (PMO) will be established in MAIL in Kabul, which will \nmanage project activities; liaise and coordinate project organization and consultant inputs; and \nundertake reporting, procurement, contract supervision and oversight, project monitoring, and \nimpact assessment and evaluation. The PMO will be provided with vehicles and equipment, ", "10   \nstaff, and consultants\u2019 inputs in contract technical oversight, procurement, and monitoring and \nevaluation.  \n \n46.  Technical support for market infrastructure design; commodity market training linked to \nthe farm market infrastructure facilities; and the development of product standards, laboratory \nsystems, and certification is included in this component. It includes the following: \n \n(i)  Farmer Market Infrastructure. Project consultants and PMO staff undertaking \nthe commodity assessment in the seven regions will identify and provide further \nspecification of small-scale infrastructure investment requirements, as well as the \nassociated postharvest technology and management and operational support \nrequired. They will identify opportunities for cluster approaches. A small training \nfund  will  provide  targeted  skills  enhancement  to  agribusinesses,  traders, \nmarketers, and MAIL staff in the project areas to support the stronger integration, \ndevelopment, and adoption of improved market and product management and \nwaste mitigation and management.  \n \n(ii)  Product  Standards  Development.  Technical  consulting  will  be  provided  to \nassist MAIL in establishing product grades and standards in priority commodities. \nMAIL will work with the Afghanistan National Standards Authority to establish \nnational product standards in line with regional and international standards. The \nProject will support MAIL in designing the proposed laboratories for testing plant \nand animal products. The Project will provide targeted support to MOCI\u2019s Raisin \nand Other Dried Fruit Institute for laboratory system management and technical \ntraining. The consultants will help MAIL to raise awareness and establish working \ngroups with farmers\u2019 groups and trade and industry associations on the improved \nproduct quality standards and certification processes. Support will be provided \nregarding agricultural policy aspects to Afghanistan\u2019s accession to WTO. \n \nC.  Special Features \n47.  The Project will address key market infrastructure and product regulatory constraints in \ntwo key commercial agriculture industries: livestock and horticulture. This will improve product \nquality, productivity, and certification for export. The market infrastructure investments will be \nundertaken through public-private partnerships involving private entities, farmers\u2019 associations, \nand agricultural cooperatives.  \n    \nD.  Indicative Project Investment Plan \n48.  The indicative project investment cost is $31.0 million, including taxes and duties of $1.9 \nmillion and physical and price contingencies of $4.4 million.

", "12 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n50.  MOF will be the Executing Agency of the Project and responsible for overall project \nmanagement and coordination. MAIL will be the Implementing Agency for all project activities \nexcept for the laboratory and training support provided to the MOCI\u2019s Raisin and Other Dried \nFruit Export Institute. A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the minister of MAIL or his \ndesignate, will be established and provide guidance on policy and strategic issues. It will meet \nquarterly. A special committee will be established by the PSC to be responsible for selecting the \nsmall-scale market subprojects according to agreed criteria. The Project organization chart and \nimplementation structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n51.  The PMO will be based in the private sector department in MAIL and manage and \ncoordinate project activities. MAIL will nominate a PMO project director with the appropriate \nqualifications and experience, whose appointment will be endorsed by ADB. The project director \nwill be assisted by contracted staff. The PSC will establish a three-person selection panel, which \nmay include a consultant team member, for recruiting key PMO staff. Recruitment will be \ncompetitive,  through  a  public  advertisement  detailing  the  contracted  staff  positions.  During \nproject preparation, a financial management assessment indicated that MOF and MAIL have \nsatisfactory  management  capacity  and  systems  for  financial  and  accounting  management, \nreporting, auditing, and internal controls. While MAIL systems are adequate, the ministry lacks \nexperience in implementing projects financed by international institutions. This shortcoming of \nMAIL is being addressed with technical capacity and consultant inputs to the PMO and the \nprivate sector department of MAIL. \n \n52.  The PMO will be responsible for implementing the project in accordance with its design; \neffectively coordinating all activities and agencies involved; ensuring project compliance with \nenvironmental  requirements  and  other  safeguards;  maintaining  all  appropriate  accounts, \nincluding  reports  on  withdrawal  applications  and  disbursements;  managing  procurement  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines; preparing progress and other reports in formats agreed with \nADB; monitoring all contracts; working closely with selected contracted service providers to \nensure that methodologies, approaches, and management systems are appropriate and deliver \nthe  expected  results;  developing  and  implementing  an  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem; and undertaking necessary public awareness procedures. \n \n53.  The PMO, with support from the consultants, will prepare and manage the contracts of \nproject  suppliers.  These  will  include  the  contracts  for  slaughterhouses  and  small-scale \ninfrastructure, consultants, and associated activities to be undertaken with training.  \n \n54.  A MAIL tender committee will be established to review and evaluate project procurement \nproposals. The PMO will assist this committee in preparing bid tender documents and be \nresponsible for the bidding process and contract award through international competitive bidding \n(ICB). The bid evaluation will be undertaken by the MAIL tender committee.  \n \n55.  MOCI will designate a staff member in the Raisin and Other Dried Fruit Export Institute \nas the project coordinator for the small MOCI component under the Project. \n ", "    13 \n2.  Implementation Period \n56.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2009 to December 2013. \nThe first year will involve setting up the project management and implementation framework and \nvarious other preparatory tasks, including (i) preparing work and financial plans; (ii) procuring \ngoods and services (consultants and other service contractors); (iii) designing and installing a \nproject monitoring and evaluation system; and (iv) contracting for civil works based on the \npreparation of tender  documents prior to project effectiveness. The project implementation \nschedule is outlined in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Flow of Funds \n57.  The PMO will be responsible for all project grant funds except those provided by MOF to \nMOCI for laboratory equipment, laboratory technical consulting inputs, and laboratory training.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n58.  Goods, services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  civil  works,  vehicles, \nmaterials, equipment, and training as described in the procurement plan (Appendix 9). The \nprocurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least  annually,  covering  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement. Civil works costing over $1 million equivalent will be procured using ICB. Civil \nworks  packages  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  follow  the  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  annex  of  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  9,  Section  3),  which \nsummarizes the necessary modifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s procedures to carry \nout NCB under ADB finance. Contracts for goods and services valued in excess of $0.5 million \nequivalent will be procured through ICB. Contracts for goods and services and training valued at \nless  than  $500,000  equivalent  may  follow  NCB.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent may follow the shopping procedure. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all documents during bidding and project \nimplementation. \n \n5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n59.  Advance  action  is  required  to  establish  the  PMO,  including  the  hiring  of  a  project \ndirector, deputy director for finance, and senior accountant. The Government was informed that \nADB approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to financing the Project. Advance \naction would enable the early preparation of draft documents for the contracting of services \nrequired under the Project and would require the Government to agree to finance the PMO and \nstaff  before  project  effectiveness.  Once  the  grant  becomes  effective,  up  to  20%  of  grant \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible  expenditures  incurred,  pursuant  to \nadvance contracting, during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to the signing of the \nfinancing agreement. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n60.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will \nprovide  81  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  186  person-months  of \nnational. Consultant firm recruitment will be based on a full technical proposal and quality- and \ncost-based selection weighted 90% technical and 10% price. Consultant inputs are outlined in ", "14   \nAppendix  10.  The  main  consultant  firm  contract  will  be  for  technical  and  management \nconsultants.  \n \n61.  The Project will engage contract employees to manage and implement the Project. This \nwill cover all PMO professional and support staff. In addition, the Project will provide strategic \nbusiness process and capacity development for the counterpart department of MAIL, the private \nsector department, to facilitate implementation and skills transfer and enhance its capacity to \ndeliver services after project completion. For these capacity-development inputs, MAIL  will \nengage consultants, as required, to support project-related activities under individual contracts. \nThe PMO will prepare the terms of reference for the proposed input and submit them to ADB for \napproval before starting selection and recruitment. For training, a number of small contracts will \nbe undertaken under shopping and NCB.  \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n62.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the implementing agencies and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nfinancial management capacity of the Executing Agency and Implementing Agency has been \nassessed  as  satisfactory.  MAIL  will  establish  eligibility  criteria  for  people  serving  on  bid \nevaluation committees and require their disclosure of any conflicts of interest. The Government \nwill undertake necessary measures to publicly disclose project-related procurement actions \nsuch  as  information  on  adopted  bidding  procedures;  specification  of  goods,  works,  and \nconsulting services; participating bidders; and contract awards. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n63.  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To expedite implementation of the Project \nthrough the timely release of funds, an imprest account will be established at a commercial bank \nacceptable to ADB for exclusive use by the PMO. The imprest account will be managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited \nin the imprest account will be the estimated expenditure to be funded from it in the first 6 months \nor 10% of the grant amount, whichever is less. ADB statement of expenditure procedures will be \nused for contracts valued at $100,000 or less. For consulting services, equipment, and civil \nworks following ICB procedures, funds will be disbursed using the direct payment method. For \ncontracts following NCB procedures and small expenditures related to PMO reimbursement, \nimprest fund procedures will be applied. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n64.  MAIL, through the PMO and MOCI\u2018s Raisin and Other Dried Fruit Export Institute, will \nprepare and maintain separate accounts for project-related disbursements that are acceptable \nto ADB and in accordance with the provisions of the financing agreement, the recommendations \nof the financial management assessment, and the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and ", "    15 \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.13 The  PMO  will  consolidate  these \naccounts and submit them to MAIL, which will review the consolidated accounts and, after \nauditing,  submit  them  to  MOF  and  ADB.  MAIL  will  establish  an  audit-review  process  and \ncommission financial and performance audits of the PMO by an audit agency in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The audit report will include a separate opinion on \nthe proper use of the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures. MAIL and \nMOCI project accounts, together with disbursement documents, will be audited annually by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB and submitted to ADB in English within 6 months of the \nend of each fiscal year. MAIL and MOCI have been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  the  suspension  of \ndisbursements of the ADB loan in case of noncompliance. \n \n65.  MAIL, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to ADB \nindicating progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to remedy the problems, and a \nprogram of activities, along with expected progress during the remainder of the implementation \nperiod. The MOCI project coordinator will submit a quarterly report on MOCI project activities in \nan agreed format to the PMO. The reports will incorporate project performance monitoring data \nand all relevant financial data and may include such other reports and information relating to the \nProject as ADB may reasonably request. The reports are to be submitted within 1 month after \nthe end of the quarter to which they relate. The annual progress report is to include an annual \nbenefit monitoring report. Within 3 months of project completion, MAIL will submit a project \ncompletion  report  to  ADB,  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  project  implementation  and \nachievements, consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impacts, and other details as \nrequested by ADB. The responsibility for preparing these reports, accounts, and statements, \nand for ensuring that they are submitted in accordance with the agreed time frame, rests with \nthe project director. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.  To monitor the Project\u2019s progress in achieving the planned outputs and outcome, the \nPMO will establish within 6 months of loan effectiveness a comprehensive system for monitoring \nand evaluating project performance. A monitoring and evaluation unit will be established in the \nPMO  to  monitor  project  performance,  including  environmental,  poverty,  gender,  and  social \nimpacts, as specified in the summary initial environmental examination (IEE) and the poverty, \nsocial, and gender assessment. The monitoring indicators in the project design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) will form the core of the data required for assessment. For periodic \nmonitoring, the PMO will confirm key indicators at project inception. The project performance \nmonitoring system will be presented to the PSC for verification. Baseline data for the agreed \nindicators will be updated every 6 months. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO will \nundertake  implementation  of  the  project  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  and  ensure  that  it  is \ncompleted  in  a  timely  manner  over  the  project  period.  The  plan  will  enable  the  effective \ninvolvement of women in implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the Project. Gender-related \nindicators will be included in the system of monitoring and evaluating project performance and \nreported to ADB. \n \n11.  Project Review \n67.  In the first 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to determine if \nall proposed implementation arrangements\u2014in particular the contractual agreements for market \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. ", "16   \ninfrastructure\u2014are appropriate and in place and to assess the effectiveness of the monitoring \nsystems. During the third year of the Project, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  to  assess  performance;  identify  problems  and  constraints \naffecting project implementation, including changes in the policy and institutional environment; \nassess options; and reach agreement on required changes to address any shortcomings. The \nproject  midterm  review  will  incorporate  any  required  changes  in  scope,  activities,  and \nassociated financial reallocation. The Government will submit a project completion report within \n3 months of the Project\u2019s closing.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n68.  The project impact will be faster agricultural growth, thereby increasing the contribution \nof the sector to GDP growth and stimulating the rural economy. The project investments will \nreduce livestock and horticulture product-processing and postharvest losses, improve product \nquality and productivity, and increase returns and sales in export markets. Project investments \nwill increase domestic consumption of selected horticulture and meat products. The major civil \nworks investment is for the construction of two slaughterhouses in Kabul and three provincial \nones, which will add value to the retail butcher value chain, improve the quality of meat products \nand hide and casing by-products, and have significant community public health benefits.  \n \n69.  The  infrastructure  interventions  to  address  horticulture  product  quality;  reduce \npostharvest  losses;  and  improve  the  grading,  storage,  and  drying  of  products  will  involve \nstrategic support through small-scale infrastructure investments in farmers\u2019 associations and \nother farmers\u2019 groups, which will boost the quality and volume for marketing. These facilities will \nbe the focal point for improved postharvest technology and market support. It is anticipated that \napproximately 200 small-scale interventions will be supported across the seven regional project \nareas. This will mean that at least 8,000 producers will directly participate. This number is very \nconservative, given the larger number of producers linked to such facilities, replication effects, \nand the adoption of improved postharvest practices. Traders and processors will benefit from \naccess to larger quantities of better-quality products, which will enable improved grading and \nproduct marketing to higher-value markets and value-adding activities.   \n \n70.  Improved  product  quality  and  standards\u2014and  the  strengthening  of  the  enabling \nenvironment toward ensuring that Afghan products can be exported with valid, recognized \nproduct certification and standards\u2014will help these products get improved grading and prices \nbased on quality and will facilitate access to new, higher-value markets for exports. \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n \n71.  Investment  in  Market  Infrastructure  Facilities.  The  financial  analysis  of  the \nslaughterhouses is based on a representative modular unit, as a standard size is planned in the \ndifferent locations. For the farm-level marketing facilities, representative market infrastructure \ninvestments have been prepared for four of the small-scale facilities (commodity collection, \nsorting,  and  grading  centers;  treatment  facilities;  packinghouses;  and  small  cold  storage  \nfacilities) to indicate the type of investment and the potential returns involved. In the models, \nlease  payments  are  made  by  the  enterprises  undertaking  long-term  management,  and  all \nworking  capital  is  sourced  from  the  enterprise.  Based  on  commercial  industry  practice, \nenterprises would structure operations to keep working capital needs feasible, and pre-selling \noutput and forward contracting with agents would offer potential to reduce them. ", "    17 \n72.  The slaughterhouse investments are financially viable, offering over 15 years a financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) before financing of 20% and a financial net present value of \n$520,000 when discounted at the indicative commercial cost of capital of 15%. The results of \nthe financial analysis for the four small-scale market facilities yield FIRRs ranging from 41% to \n68%,  which  indicates  financial  viability.  The  enterprises  with  export  potential  have  the \nopportunity for further increase returns over the base case FIRR, should the traders increase \nexport  sales  of  improved  products  or  sales  into  new  markets  for  a  portion  of  the  annual \nthroughput  above  the  estimated  level.  The  enterprises  will  generate  other  unquantifiable \nbenefits in terms of improved hygiene, food safety, and environmental management. More \ndetails are provided on the financial and economic analysis in Appendix 11 and Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n73.  The economic analysis is based on prices converted to their border equivalents by \napplying a standard conversion factor of 0.97 and, for consulting services, of 0.80. A shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.75 has been used in calculating the economic cost of civil works and the \ndirect labor costs in slaughterhouses, reflecting demand for labor in the project area. \n \n74.  The project economic return is based on the with-project incremental economic return \nfrom improved slaughterhouses in terms of meat and by-product quality, and on commodity \nmarket facilities with reduced commodity losses and improved prices partly reflecting commodity \nquality improvements through better postharvest handling. The economic return is conservative, \nas it does not include the significant public health benefits from the hygienic slaughter of \nlivestock in urban areas or the likely incremental returns from agribusiness market investments. \nThe Project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 29.5%.  \nB.  Environmental Impact \n75.  An IEE conducted during project preparation confirms that the Project will have positive \nenvironmental impacts. A summary of the IEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. The \nproposed Project is classified as category B. In the slaughterhouses, wastewater management \nsystems will be established as an integral aspect of their design and operation, with waste \nproducts to meet national and international standards, in line with ADB policy. Such regulations \nhave yet to be established in Afghanistan. \n   \nC.  Impact on Living Standards \n76.  Socioeconomic analysis based on a social assessment indicates that the Project will \nimprove  rural  living  standards  by  increasing  employment  opportunities  in  expanding \nagribusinesses for semiskilled and skilled workers, as well as by providing benefits at the \nproduction  level  through  the  adoption  of  improved  harvest  and  postharvest  practices  and \ntechnologies that will improve productivity, quality, and market returns. These interventions will \nhave a major social impact and reduce poverty.   \n \n77.  In the targeted commodity chains of the Project, the interventions will improve marketing \ninfrastructure  and  the  operation  of  these  facilities  by  farmers\u2019  and  industry  associations. \nStrengthened supply lines will facilitate expansion and the establishment of new trading and \nprocessing businesses. The proposed project interventions will help existing small-scale and \ncottage enterprises through replication and the adoption of improved practices. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n ", "18   \n1.  Gender and Development  \n78.  Women are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, to a \nlesser extent, in trading agricultural produce. The Project\u2019s strengthening of commodity value \nchains from the postharvest stage will create an opportunity to support women\u2019s producer \nassociations interested in improving the quality of their produce, thereby enabling rural women \nto benefit. Women will benefit as employees in agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, and members of \nwomen\u2019s groups involved in production or supply. \n \n79.  Although reliable gender-disaggregated data is lacking, Afghanistan\u2019s gender indicators \nare very poor, as indicated by gender gaps in health, education, access to and control over \nresources, economic opportunities, justice, and political participation. Women are important \neconomic actors, but there is limited data on their contribution and the role they play. While \nAfghanistan\u2019s constitution enshrines women\u2019s equality, progress toward this ideal will take time, \ngiven prevailing cultural, social, and religious sensitivities.  \n \n80.  A  project-specific  GAP  has  been  developed  and  will  be  revised  during  project \nimplementation. A summarized version is in Appendix 13. The project GAP will ensure that a \ncertain percentage of the stakeholders participating in project planning are women, as will be a \ncertain  percentage  of  the  management  staff  of  the  Project  and  supporting  institutions \nresponsible for implementing the Project, and that women-headed households, associations, \nand businesses participate. The different groups will require different strategies and activities to \nget their involvement. A gender assessment will be conducted during monitoring and evaluation.  \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n81.  Project and construction activities will be undertaken on existing Government land in \nKabul and the provinces. No land acquisition or resettlement will be necessary for the planned \nphysical infrastructure under the Project, as slaughterhouses and small buildings will be built on \nGovernment land. \n3.  Project Impact on Indigenous Peoples \n82.  Afghanistan  has  several  ethnic  groups,  but  they  participate  equally  in  national \nsocioeconomic  processes.  No  vulnerable  groups  identifiable  under  the  indigenous  people \ndefinition of ADB\u2019s indigenous people\u2019s policy will be affected by the Project. \nD.  Risk Assessment \n83.  Security  remains  the  single  greatest  risk  affecting  private  business  investment  and \nproject  implementation.  Changes  in  the  security  environment  may  affect  proposed  project \nactivities  in  certain  regions,  implementation  duration,  and  the  ability  of  project  staff  and \nconsultants to effectively undertake planned interventions. If increased security is required, it will \nhave cost implications and affect the quality of the consultants prepared to participate in the \nProject. The Project will be flexible regarding geographic areas in case the security environment \nwill not allow implementation. The Government will assist with any required security support. \nProducer  and  business  investment  and  financial  sector  activity  will  be  affected  by  these \nchanges.  \n  \n84.  The Government is committed to the Project and to key policy reforms. This is required \nby the Project to improve product standards and product certification. Institutional capacity is a \nconstraint,  and  the  Project  will  provide  strategic  capacity  building  in  the  private  sector ", "    19 \ndepartment of MAIL and consultant support to MAIL for project management and procurement. \nThe Government\u2019s adoption of the planned public administration reforms is required. Project \ninvestments will support business development and result in a stronger private agribusiness \nsector. These networks and marketing channels have the ability to operate should the security \nenvironment change.  \n \n85.  The  project  market  infrastructure  will  make  a  big  difference  to  producers  and \nbusinesses.  It  will  facilitate  business  development  and  the  building  of  a  stronger  private \nagribusiness sector. One risk is the maintenance and repair of the facilities, particularly the \nhorticulture facilities. Careful management and supervision by the private companies operating \nthe slaughterhouses, and their eventual ownership of the assets, will mitigate most of the risk. \nFor the farmer associations and cooperatives operating the small-scale horticulture facilities, \ncareful management and supervision will mitigate some of this risk. While management support \nwill be provided by the Project to build their capacity, the magnitude of the risk should not be \nunderestimated. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n86.  The following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances, have been agreed \nwith the Government and will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n (i)  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, MAIL will put in place appropriate and \nadequate  financial  control  and  accounting  systems,  so  that  PMO  can  apply \ninternational accounting standards during project implementation. \n(ii)  With respect to the slaughterhouses and the market infrastructure facilities, MAIL \nwill follow the selection criteria and approval procedures set forth. \n(iii)  MAIL will ensure that the terms and conditions for the transfer of ownership of the \nslaughterhouse facilities to the relevant private sector entities are agreed upon in \nadvance with ADB, and that such transfer takes place in a timely manner on such \nterms and conditions. \n(iv)  Prior to commencement of any evaluation of bids and within 1 month of grant \neffectiveness, MAIL will have established eligibility criteria acceptable to ADB for \npersons  serving  on  the  bid  tender  committee,  including  but  not  limited  to \ndisclosure  by  such  persons  of  any  conflicts  of  interest.  During  the  project \nimplementation period, MOF and MAIL will disclose, on their websites and in at \nleast one local newspaper, project-related procurement actions such as adopted \nbidding  procedures,  specifications  of  goods,  works  and  consulting  services, \nparticipating bidders, and awards of contracts. \n(v)  Prior to commencement of civil works for any market infrastructure facility, MAIL \nand the relevant party (e.g., farmers association or agricultural cooperatives) will \nhave  entered  into  a  written  agreement  regarding  respective  responsibilities \nrelating to construction, operation and maintenance of such facilities, including \nfinancing and any in-kind counterpart contributions. \n(vi)  MAIL will ensure that all civil works contracts contain provisions: (a) requiring \ncontractors to comply with applicable workplace occupational safety norms and \napplicable labor laws, (b) prohibiting the use of child labor, and (c) ensuring that \nthere is no differentiation in wages between men and women for the same work. \n(vii)  Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will ensure that (a) \nMAIL reviews existing quality standards and certification systems and prepares \nupdates  for  such  standards  and  systems,  so  that  they  are  consistent  with ", "20   \ninternationally  recognized  levels  for  fruit  and  vegetable  commodities  and \nproducts  (e.g.,  Codex  Alimentarius),  and  (b)  the  Afghanistan  National \nStandardization Authority adopts such standards and certification systems within \n24 months of grant effectiveness.  \n(viii)  Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MAIL will have prepared the Afghan \nagriculture sector inputs as required for Afghanistan\u2019s WTO accession process.  \n(ix)  Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MOCI will have approved improved \nlaboratory  procedures  and  management  practices.  Within  6  months  after \napproval  of  such  procedures  and  practices,  MOCI  will  have  provided  the \nnecessary training on such procedures and practices.  \n(x)  MAIL will ensure that the Project is carried out in accordance with all applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and initial \nenvironment examination.  \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that the carrying out of the Project will not involve \nany land acquisition or resettlement of persons, and will not have any adverse \nimpact on indigenous peoples. \n(xii)  MAIL will ensure that the gender action plan is implemented in a timely manner \nover the entire project implementation period, and that adequate resources are \nallocated for this purpose.  \n(xiii)  The Government will exercise its best efforts to provide adequate security for the \nsmooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project. In addition, for each civil \nworks contract, the Government will ensure that an action plan for adequate \nsecurity and smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project is prepared, \nthe cost of implementing such a plan is included in the budget for civil works, and \nsuch plan is fully implemented. \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness  \n(i)  The PMO shall have been established with a project director and a finance \nadministration manager acceptable to ADB.  \n(ii)  The Government shall have established the project steering committee to be \nchaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock or his designate \nand with representatives from MOCI, MOF, and the private sector.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n87.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $30,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Agriculture Market Infrastructure Project, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n29 October 2008 \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nAgricultural growth  Agriculture\u2019s contribution to  Government\u2019s national  \u2022  Government \nincreased  gross domestic product  statistics  policies continue to \n  (GDP) increased by 2% by    support private \n2013  Project completion report  sector-led \n  economic growth \n  \u2022  Government and \n  other sector \nprojects achieve \nexpected outcomes \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nMore efficient  Increased value of  Government statistics,  \u2022  Government \nhorticulture and  horticulture commodities  agribusiness surveys, and  policies support \nlivestock  (export and domestic) by  reports  agribusiness \nagribusiness  7% by 2013    development \nindustries    Ministry of Commerce and  \u2022  Expansion in rural \n  7% increase in domestic  Industries (MOCI) trade  finance \n  consumption of horticulture  statistics    \nproducts by 2013    Risk \n  Project monitoring system  \u2022  Unstable security \nIncreased consumption of    conditions \nhygienically slaughtered  Export Promotion Agency   \nmeat in Kabul and major  of Afghanistan reports \nprovincial cities by at least   \n15% by 2013  Ministry of Agriculture, \n  Irrigation, and Livestock \nIncreased value of livestock  (MAIL) agricultural \nby-products (hides and  commodity statistics \ncasings) by 7% by 2013   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Introduction  \n \n1.  In  Afghanistan,  commercial  agriculture  and  rural  enterprise  development  is  the  key \neconomic driver for sustainable economic growth and employment generation and improved \nlivelihoods for large numbers of people in rural areas. With agriculture accounting for half of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), developing commercial agriculture and building on the \ntraditional commodity value chains in which Afghanistan has a comparative advantage will \nsupport economic growth and provide legal alternatives to opium poppy production. The rural \neconomy is the major source of employment and income for most Afghans, as nearly 80% of \nthe population, or 19 million people, live in impoverished rural areas. Rural economic growth\u2014in \nagricultural  production,  diversification,  and  value  addition\u2014is  essential  for  any  sustained \nimprovement in livelihoods. In 2005/2006, a year affected by drought, agriculture\u2014including \ncereal crops, horticulture, and livestock but excluding opium\u2014was the largest legal domestic \nsource of income, accounting for approximately 37% of the GDP.  \n \n2.  While  wheat  is  the  major  agriculture  output,  accounting  for  over  two  thirds  of  the \ncultivated area and for 80% of the cereal area, it is typically a subsistence crop. About 40% of \ncereal area is rain fed, and 60% receives some irrigation. Afghan commercial agriculture has \ntraditionally produced significantly high-value horticultural and livestock products for domestic \nand export markets. It had a comparative advantage in these commodities. In the late 1970s, \nAfghanistan  supplied  20%  of  the  global  market  for  raisins,  dominated  the  world  pistachio \nmarket, and regionally exported livestock and wool products. During the long period of conflict \nand severe drought in the late 1990s, the production base for these commodities was severely \ndamaged. Combined with the loss of irrigation infrastructure and technical and market support, \nthis reduced the productivity of most agricultural commodities and created high postharvest \nlosses of 30%\u201340%.  \n \n3.  Since 2001, a number of projects have supported reestablishing the horticulture and \nlivestock subsector with large investments in irrigation rehabilitation and technical, production, \nand  some  market  support.  Livestock  numbers  have  increased,  and  horticulture  area  and \nproduction is expanding, with new plantings estimated at 12,000 hectares (ha) per year. These \ncommercial agricultural activities will further grow with improved access to irrigation following \nrecent investments in irrigation projects. In 2006, exports of fruit were $70 million and of dried \nfruits  and  nuts  $110  million.  Livestock  product  exports  are  also  expanding.  In  2007,  the \nestimated value added by small and mechanized agribusinesses was over $500 million. \n \n4.  Slaughterhouses  were  destroyed  during  the  conflict,  and  almost  all  livestock \nslaughtering is now undertaken in urban backyards and streets and in rural areas, which harms \nproduct quality and endangers public health. Approximately 240,000 cattle and buffalo are \nslaughtered per year in Kabul, out of the total 1 million slaughtered in the country, and 1 million \nsheep and goats are slaughtered annually in Kabul, out of the country kill of 5 million. \n \n5.  The potential to expand commercial agriculture in terms of volume, quality, and value \nadded,  starting  at  the  production  base,  exists  in  the  markets  in  which  Afghanistan  has  a \ncomparative  advantage  for  domestic  production  and  import  substitution,  as  well  as  in  the \nexpansion  of  exports.  While  existing  projects  have  focused  on  the  production  base  in \nhorticulture and livestock in some regional areas, a key priority is to complement these activities \nwith a focus on strengthening postharvest standards and commercial agriculture development. \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \n6.  The informal sector dominates in agriculture, as in the broader economy. Addressing \nconstraints  that  limit  movement  from  the  informal  to  the  formal  economy  is  critical  in  an \nenvironment of weak regulatory processes, poor infrastructure, limited access to finance, and \nsecurity issues. This shift will be essential if the economy is to generate sustainable medium-\nterm growth and increase employment, productivity, and government revenue.  \n \n7.  Afghan agribusinesses and enterprises\u2014covering production, processing, distribution, \nmarketing, manufacturing, and services\u2014provide some level of mechanization and scale in \nprocessing raisins, nut shelling, sorting and packing, drying vegetables, ginning cotton, cleaning \ngrain seed, and milling wheat. For the remaining commodities, agribusiness enterprises in fresh \nfruit sorting and packing; dried fruit processing; dairy; wool spinning; carpet weaving, cutting, \nand  washing;  butchering;  and  hide  and  skin  tanning  have  tended  to  operate  as  cottage \nindustries using traditional technologies and producing products of lower quality and price. In \nterms of export commodities, quality and traceability issues constrain access and growth.    \n \n8.  While there has been the establishment and growth of agribusinesses, the existing ones \ngenerally use low technology and add little value. There is significant potential for existing small \nagribusinesses to expand to meet growing domestic demand for value-added products and into \nexport markets. Such development and expansion is constrained by limited market access, poor \nquality and volume of production, high investment risk, a weak enabling environment, limited \naccess  to  finance  for  lack  of  financial  sector  coverage  and  capacity  to  invest,  ineffectual \ntechnical and management support services, and limited access to market information and \npublic\u2013private support services. Interventions to mitigate these constraints will bring higher \nprices and returns for agribusinesses and the rural economy. \n \nB.  Government Strategy \n \n9.  The Government agricultural sector master plan details opportunities for growth and \nvalue addition in the core horticulture and livestock subsector and the need to develop a market-\nbased regulatory environment with access to inputs, services, and markets. MAIL is establishing \nthe regulatory environment and building its capacity to undertake the required certification and \nproduct quality assessment. It has removed previous barriers to private enterprise. The ADB \ncountry strategy and program1 sector road map supports the Government agenda. \n \n10.  The weak institutional and enabling regulatory environment, which lacks legislation in the \nform of a leasing and secure transactions law, regulations, product standards, quality assurance \nsystems, or a trade policy, is an issue. The provision of public and private support services from \nthe relevant government ministries, chambers of commerce and industry, business development \nand  technical  service  providers,  and  agribusiness  associations  is  weak,  which  limits \nagribusinesses\u2019 access to improved technologies and vital business planning and management \nskills and their ability to improve product quality and organize themselves in more competitive, \nintegrated industries.   \n \nC.  Horticulture Subsector \n \n11.  Traditional horticulture crops of dried fruits and nuts and fresh fruits and vegetables have \nplayed a dominant role in Afghanistan\u2019s exports, accounting in 1979 for approximately $230 \nmillion  in  exports.  The  horticulture  area  has  expanded  since  2001  and,  in  2005,  totaled \napproximately 122,000 ha. Perennial nut crops totaled 12,000 ha and fruit 106,000 ha, of which \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008): Afghanistan. Manila. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \ngrapes  accounted  for  58,000  ha,  apricots  8,000  ha,  berries  9,000  ha,  and  figs  7,000  ha. \nNurseries\u2019 current sales of nut and fruit seedlings indicate area expansion of 12,000 ha per \nyear. This, combined with improved irrigation, will bring rapid expansion in production volume \nand  of  the  opportunity  and  need  to  support  commercial  market  development  and  quality \nproduction.   \n \n12.  Domestic demand for fresh fruits and vegetables and key commodities is strong, as is \nexport demand. In 2006, the value of exports was $70 million for fresh fruits and $111 million for \ndried fruits and nuts. Experts have estimated that, if productivity and quality can be improved, \nthe sector can contribute $1.5 billion in exports in 10 years.2 The Government\u2019s lower target is \n$250 million by 2015. Achieving these outcomes will require improved harvest and postharvest \npractices;  infrastructure  investment  in  storage,  packing  and  cold  storage,  processing,  and \nproduct quality; improved planting material; and better access to technology and management \nservices. The small-scale farmers that dominate production will benefit from establishing and \nstrengthening farmers\u2019 groups which will improve market opportunities. \n \n13.  Almond  Value  Chain.  Exports  of  almonds  in  2005  were  11,000  tons,  out  of  total \nproduction of 39,000 tons from an area of 12,000 ha. Market demand is increasing domestically, \nin traditional importing countries such as India and Pakistan, and in new markets. India is the \nkey buyer of soft-shelled almonds and the highest-quality kernels. Pakistani demand is more for \nthe second-quality kernels for their confectionary industry. Smaller markets are in the Middle \nEast. Traders indicate that 2% of almonds of the hard-shelled varieties are bitter, which is an \nissue in international markets but to date has not affected the Indian market. \n \n14.  Almond  trading  centers  in  Kabul,  Kandahar,  Kunduz,  and  Mazar  are  also used  for \ntrading other types of nuts and dried fruit, as well as for export. Kabul is the major trading \nmarketplace, and traders indicate that they export almonds in a ratio of two to one in shells and \nas kernels. Farmers sell through traditional market systems to local markets and field agents for \ntraders without doing much if any grading and sorting. Key issues are bitter taste, immature \nkernels, and high moisture content. Generally, traders are interested in buying almonds from \ndistrict traders or farmers, repackaging, and shipping. By so doing, they add little value.   \n \n15.  Limited processing is currently undertaken. Three almond-cracking plants have been \nacquired but are not operational or are being modified for local conditions such as variable size \nbefore coming into production. As their stated capacity is 600 tons per year, even when these \nthree plants are in operation, there will still be a lot of unmet demand. It would take a further 16 \nsuch plants to shell 30% of production. The Dried Fruit Processing Association in Mazar has \ntaken delivery of a processing plant to add value by mechanically shelling and manually sorting \nthe nuts. The association intends to hire in management and marketing expertise to run the \nbusiness in their new factory. A plant has also been acquired in Kandahar. \n \n16.  The lack of grading and sorting machinery constrains the industry from achieving better \nefficiency, maintaining hygienic standards, or reaching the product quality required in export \nmarkets where product certification is necessary. Links between producer associations and \ntrader  associations  needs  to  be  strengthened  so  that  traders  can  provide  better  market \nfeedback  to  growers  in  terms  of  quality.  Growers  also  need  quality  inputs  and  improved \ntechnology.  Packing  systems  need  to  be  improved,  to reduce  damage  during transport  to \nmarket. Existing testing laboratories are limited, and the certification they provide does not carry \ninternational credibility. Forming and strengthening producer associations would be one way for \n                                                 \n2  The OTF Group. 2006.

", "  Appendix 3  29 \nproducers to improve product volume and quality and provide direct market opportunities with \ntraders.  \n \n17.  Pistachio Value Chain. Until the 1980s, wild pistachios were a major agricultural export. \nPistachios were harvested from natural pistachio forests located mostly in the Herat region, \nwhich operated under government- and community-based management systems. These forests \nwere damaged during the conflict, with more than half of the trees estimated to have been lost. \nIn 2005, the harvest was estimated at 23,000 tons, which had an in-shell value of $12 million. \n \n18.  Afghanistan  has  comparative  advantages  in  pistachio  production  and  a  product \npreferred in India. The potential for pistachio production in Afghanistan is enormous, with world \ndemand increasing faster than supply. Iran alone supplies more than 66% of world demand, but \nproduction conditions are declining due to salinity and irrigation problems. The current lack of \nmanagement of these forests is resulting in early harvesting of pistachios by households, which \nreduces yield, and the product is sold as a whole nut to traders, wholesalers, or directly to large \ntrading houses in Herat. The traders have the nuts shelled by households, sorted, graded, and \npacked  for  export  to  India,  Pakistan,  and  the  Middle  East.  Scope  exists  to  mechanize \nprocessing similar to that for almonds. \n \n19.  Raisin Value Chain. Raisins are one the largest and most important horticultural crop in \nAfghanistan, where they are a by-product of fresh grape production. This is in contrast to raisin \nproduction in developed countries, especially in dominant California, where fresh grapes and \nraisins are two different crops with very different production and marketing strategies. While \ngrapes are grown in almost all regions of Afghanistan, certain areas such as the southern \nprovinces and Ghazni have reputations for producing better-quality products, and the regional \nvarieties shindukhani, geerduk, and taifee are in demand in certain export markets. During the \n1960s and 1970s, raisin exports from Afghanistan supplied 60% of the world market.  \n \n20.  Domestic  and  export  demand  has  increased,  and  the  various  raisin  products  have \ndifferent destinations. Kishmish, the green raisin dried in the shade, is a more valuable product \nthan aftabi, which is the sun-dried black or red raisin. Kishmish is sold almost entirely in India \nand Pakistan. Aftabi is also sold in South Asia, but its main markets are in Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union. The harvest and sale of the fresh grapes removes about 30%\u201340% of the \ncrop from the orchard, and the harvest and hanging of the other grapes for kishmish production \nremoves a similar portion. Thus about 20%\u201330% of the crop remains\u2014the poorest quality\u2014and \nthis is the fruit from which the sun-dried aftabi raisin is prepared. These grapes are dried on any \navailable  surface  with  minimum  inputs  and  are  not  generally  of  good  quality.  The  drying \ntechnique almost guarantees that they will not compete with the higher-quality Californian or \ncomparable sun-dried raisins. They require double washing and careful hand sorting to render \nthem acceptable for a discriminating developed market. \n \n21.  Raisin producers either sell at harvest at low prices or store the crop for later sale. \nProducers most commonly sell at local markets in 50\u2013100 kilogram consignments to traders, but \nsome sell to field agents at the farm gate or to wholesale markets, if such outlets are close. \nLocal markets operate with small consignments, but when purchasers want large volumes the \nprice can be volatile. As selling is done by individual producers, their bargaining power is low, \nand  the  industry  fails  to  expand  as  it  is  difficult  for  traders  to  acquire  large  volumes. \nStrengthening farmers\u2019 associations would enable producers to improve postharvest practices, \ncollect larger volumes, and negotiate contracts with buyers that would lower marketing costs. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n22.  Traders and exporters undertake limited grading, sorting, packing, and processing prior \nto sale. There is relatively little processing of green kishmish, which cannot easily be washed \nwithout damaging the quality. In the wholesale markets, the product is usually sorted into \ndifferent quality grades based on shape, size, and color. Aftabi for export undergo factory \nprocessing, but only for certain markets. Raisins that are exported to Dubai or Pakistan often do \nnot undergo factory processing in Afghanistan, as they are often double washed in factories at \ntheir destination. While there used to be at least 31 raisin-processing factories in Afghanistan, \nfew of these survived the conflict. Approximately 13 processing plants currently operate, using \nAmerican processing lines that are over 30 years old. After the mechanical processing, manual \nsorting occurs. The raisins are then boxed for export. The quality of the processing and packing \nis generally poor. Consignments for European and increasingly Russian markets are often \ndouble washed, processed, and manually sorted to make sure all capstems are removed. \nLengthy transit times from Afghanistan to the port of Karachi and delays damage the product \nand worsen losses. \n \n23.  Fresh Grape Value Chain. Grape area is expanding. In 2005, an area of 58,000 ha \nproduced 400,000 tons, making grape the largest horticultural product in Afghanistan. \n \n24.  Local Marketing of Fresh Grapes. The producer decides the allocation of the crop \nbetween fresh grape and shade-dried kishmish based on price differentials, provided that he or \nshe owns a kishmish khana in which grapes can be shade-dried. The remainder will be sun-\ndried raisins. Most grape growers currently use contractors to harvest fresh grapes, though they \nthemselves harvest and process the grapes they keep for raisin production. Fresh fruit demands \nimmediate marketing within a week of harvesting, and farmers currently rely on traders for \npacking and market connections. The farmer will agree to sell about 30%\u201340% of his or her \ncrop fresh to the harvesting contractor. Payment to the producer is split, with 30% of the \nestimated value of the crop paid at the time of the deal, another 30% paid halfway through the \nharvest, and the final 40% paid at the end of the harvest. It is common for the contractor to \ndelay payment; misrepresent the weight of the grapes harvested; attempt to renegotiate the \ndeal halfway through, claiming bad market conditions; or simply not pay for a portion of the \ngrapes harvested. Few growers see these arrangements as ideal, but options are limited unless \nfarmers\u2019 groups develop to strengthen their marketing position.  \n \n25.  Exports to Pakistan are mostly through wholesale market auctions, but some negotiated \nsales go directly through commission agents to retailers. In India, traders and exporters seek \npriced contracts, including cost insurance and freight, with importers or, as currently is being \npiloted, contract sale to supermarket chains in India. With few cold chains in operation, the sale \nneeds to occur quickly. Small volumes are currently exported using cold chains. A limited \nnumber of farmer marketing associations and cooperatives exist, and growers need a real \nincentive in the form of increased returns to use value-increasing horticultural techniques, such \nas girdling, bunch-thinning, or crop thinning, to improve quality.  \n \n26.  Key issues affecting value chain performance stem from production, with producers not \ndifferentiating between fresh grapes and raisins; producers generally having limited knowledge \nof the quality requirements of the market, which affects picking, sorting, and packing; water \nscarcities affecting production; access to and the adoption of new technologies and improved \nvarieties constrained; and postharvest handling poor, with very limited access to cold storage or \nshipping freshly harvested grapes. \n \n27.  Pomegranate Value Chain. Afghanistan is a traditional cultivator of pomegranates and \nis known for the excellent quality of its native varieties, in particular in Balkh, Kandahar, Kapisa, ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nand Samangan provinces. Estimates in 2007 indicated the area under pomegranate orchards at \n5,700 ha, producing 99,000 tons of fruit. The value of the output of these orchards was $30 \nmillion, equal to that of apricots. Iran is currently the leading world producer, at 670,000 tons. \nWith  regional  and  international  demand  increasing,  prices  have  risen.  There  is  scope  for \nsignificant  expansion  in  domestic  consumption,  exports,  and  returns  once  constraints  are \novercome.  Improved  technology  and  postharvest  handling  and  the  use  of  refrigeration  for \ntransport on the ground and by air will improve quality and returns and enable expansion \nbeyond existing markets. \n \n28.  Apricot  Value  Chain.  Afghanistan  has  a  long  history  of  producing  and  exporting \napricots, both fresh and dried. In 2005, the production of fresh apricots was estimated at \n100,000  tons,  and  of  dried  apricots  66,000  tons.  Since  2001,  area  and  production  have \nincreased, and domestic consumption and exports are again expanding. Pakistan is the main \ntrading partner for stone fruits (including apricots in the Peshawar market), watermelons, and \napples. Afghanistan exports dried fruits through the Central Asian republics, Iran, and Pakistan \nto markets in India, the Middle East, and the Russian Federation. Limited access to improved \ntechnology and inputs, low productivity, poor harvest and postharvest management, the lack of \ncertification, and limited refrigerated transport by road or air depress product quality and price \nand market expansion. Market channels are similar to those of other horticultural commodities.  \n \n29.  Apple  Value  Chain.  Apple  production  is  expanding.  In  2005  it  was  approximately \n570,000 tons, focused on meeting domestic demand. Competition in the market from fruits \nimported from Iran and Pakistan provides an opportunity for import substitution. Estimates are \nthat 10,000 tons were exported to Pakistan. The challenges for the value chain are similar to \nthose for apricots, except that the target market is domestic. Key issues are low productivity, \nhigh harvest and postharvest losses of 40%, poor packing and grading, and the lack of cold \nstorage. \n \nD.  Livestock Subsector \n \n30.  Livestock plays a part in all farming systems of Afghanistan, where agricultural and \npasture areas account for 45% of land area. Livestock numbers fell dramatically from the late \n1970s to the late 1990s because of war, prolonged drought, and the collapse of veterinary care \nand services. This decline in livestock numbers has left Afghanistan short of milk, red meat, \nchicken meat, eggs, and wool, fueling the substantial import of live animals and products of \nanimal origin. Most inedible products are exported after first-stage processing\u2014such as salting \nand washing skins, hides and intestines and dehairing for cashmere\u2014or without any processing \nat all. Current agribusiness added value to Afghan livestock products is very limited. There are a \nfew wool-spinning factories, but most processing of products of animal origin is still a cottage \nindustry.  \n \n31.  Official livestock numbers are indicative only (FAO 2003 census), with estimates for \ncattle at 4 million, sheep 9 million (half of the census number in the 1980s to early 1990s, which \nwas 19 million), goats 7.3 million, and poultry 12 million.3 These are considered underestimates, \nas the livestock of nomadic kuchis was largely not included. Over time, with improved rainfall \nand fodder production, and with further development in animal production and veterinary service \ndelivery  systems,  the  livestock  population  is  expected  to  rise.  It  is  estimated  that  this \ndevelopment will take 10 years for small ruminants and 20 years for large ones.

Rome. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nborder, veterinary, and sanitary inspection services are not able to keep track of the movement \nof livestock imports or of their quality or health status.  \n \n32.  Interventions to address constraints in the livestock value chain should (i) increase \nlivestock  production  that  is  competitive  with  imports  and  improve  the  quality  of  livestock \nproducts  through  compliance  with  food  safety  requirements;  (ii)  remove  bottlenecks  for \ndeveloping  livestock  agribusiness  so  that  livestock  agribusinesses  in  Pakistan  return  to \nAfghanistan and add more value to products locally; (iii) build up supply channels and/or a \nproduction  base  for  such  necessary  inputs  as  stock  feeds,  parent  stock,  hatchlings,  and \nvaccines; and (iv) set up milk-collection centers, dairy plants for processing local milk, improved \nlivestock markets, slaughterhouses, tanneries, and casing-preparation plants with European \nUnion licenses for aggregation and processing.  \n \n33.  Red Meat Value Chain. The red meat value chain includes cattle, buffaloes, goats, and \nsheep. All major cities are supplied with live animals from the rural areas and imports from \nPakistan. Estimates are that at least 90,000 buffaloes are slaughtered per year in Kabul (based \non averaging butchers\u2019 association and skin and hides\u2019 association estimates) and 180,000 \nbuffaloes  are  slaughtered  in  the  whole  country.  The  total  number  of  cattle  slaughtered  is \nestimated at 800,000 for the whole country (approximately 40% local) and 150,000 for Kabul \ncity. About 1 million small ruminants are slaughtered in the Kabul market, and 5 million are \nslaughtered in the whole country. \n \n34.  Livestock Marketing.  Basic livestock markets exist in all major towns. In Kabul there \nare four markets, two large ones for butchers and other wholesalers and two smaller markets for \nretail to consumers. Livestock traders are organized in associations and have committees with a \ndirector working as a broker between butchers and traders. The common practice is that most \ntraders take the animals from the villages with payment made after the sale of the livestock. Of \nthe total number of animals sold on the market, at least 60% are sold on credit to butchers, with \nthe butcher having a maximum of 7 days to pay. \n \n35.  Slaughterhouses. The only proper slaughterhouse in Kabul is owned by the Ministry of \nDefense, with small-scale and basic slabs-type slaughtering facilities being built or considered in \nGhazni, Jalalabad, and Kunduz. The situation in respect to slaughtering in Kabul and other \ncities is poor for the quality of the meat and the by-products and for protecting public health. \nAnimals are slaughtered near livestock markets in backyards, and carcasses are transported in \nand the open, exposed to the elements. As there is no provision for hanging carcasses, often \nrequiring that skinning take place on the ground, skins often suffer more damage than they \nwould if they were hung.  \n \n36.  Hides, Skins, and Casings. Hides and skins have always been important exports for \nAfghanistan. Most hides and skins are collected, salted, and exported to Pakistan for further \nprocessing. However, there has been little or no investment in maintaining the hides and skins \nin the process, and only a few companies with limited capacity add value to them. The four \nmajor hide and skin collection centers in Kabul are situated in the center of town, posing health \nand environmental threats. Casings, or intestines, from sheep and goats are collected by trader \nassociations and exported to Pakistan, where they are further cleaned, graded, processed, and \nexported. The Western European market is particularly important for casings, which must meet \nstringent European Union standards.  \n \n37.  Wool and Carpet Value Chain. Ghazni wool, from white, fat-tail sheep around Ghazni, \nis important for the carpet industry. The wool fetches a premium price because of its excellence ", "  Appendix 3  33 \nas carpet wool. Wool traders situated in different towns are usually small-scale entrepreneurs \nusing limited working capital to purchase and store wool. They typically purchase between 5 \nand 10 tons of wool, which is contracted to local women to spin. Pakistani and Afghan wool \ntraders  in  Pakistan  compete  for  this  wool,  which  is  spun  in  Pakistan.  Afghanistan\u2019s  wool \nrequirements can be only partly satisfied with local wool. Wool traders estimate that only 40% of \nall wool used is local, with the rest imported from Iran, Iraq, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia.  \n \n38.  Carpets. While Afghan carpets are the largest export product from Afghanistan, it is \ndifficult to get an accurate estimate of the scale of carpet production in Afghanistan. The Export \nPromotion Agency of Afghanistan estimates production to be about 2 million carpets annually. \nAs the average carpet measures 3.2 square meters, this equates to 6.4 million square meters of \ncarpet. Industry estimates indicate that this would be a conservative figure. Afghan carpets are \nin demand internationally, and the industry needs to maintain and improve quality and promote \nthem in export markets to strengthen Afghan branding. Currently 80% to 95% of carpets are \nfinished in Pakistan and re-exported as Pakistani carpets. Official estimates are that $176 \nmillion worth of carpets were exported through formal channels in 2006. Considering industry \nestimates of production and informal trade, the value of exported carpets is likely double the \nofficial figure. \n \n39.  The carpet value chain is based around four main centers: Andkhoy, Herat, Kabul, and \nMazar.  The  carpet  companies  and  associations  of  which  they  are  members  operate  by \nproviding such inputs as wool, designs, advance payment, and looms for rent and sale to \nhousehold  weavers.  Or,  in  some  cases,  the  companies  provide  only  the  design,  and  the \nweavers provide other inputs. When carpets are finished and graded, payment is made. The \nindustry is based on weavers, mostly women, working at home. Clusters of production exist in \nmany parts of the country. Pakistan is closely involved in the production of carpets, including the \nprovision of capital and designs and washing and cutting before export to Europe or the United \nStates. Opportunities exist to add more value in Afghanistan, but this will require access to such \ninputs as wool, finance, quality chemicals, and cutting and washing facilities. A new cutting and \nwashing facility is currently planned in Jalalabad. Facilitating this value addition will require \nimproved raw material and wool treatment; training for weavers; more secure transport; and \naccess to international markets, finance, and other inputs.  \n \n40.  Cashmere.  As  Afghanistan  has  8  million  goats,  cashmere  is  a  resource  to  be \ndeveloped.  Traditional  cashmere  collection  and  processing  was  and  still  is  common  in \nBadakhshan and Hazarajat, though producers operated during the conflict with a domestic \nfocus. Improved harvesting and processing techniques need to be adopted. The main center for \nthe cashmere trade in Afghanistan is Herat, with export via Iran to either the People\u2019s Republic \nof China or Europe.  \n \n41.  Dairy. Afghanistan is a large net importer of milk powder and other dairy products. As \nthere are an estimated 4 million local cows, milk is already used as feed for calves, for family \nconsumption, and, to a limited extent, for sale in processed form. A significant increase in milk \nproduction through increased productivity and increased numbers of cows would be required for \na milk surplus to be generated that could be used for processing and thereby substituting for the \nlarge quantity of imported dairy products. Dairy projects are being developed and considered in \ndifferent parts of the country.  \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nE.  Sector Potential \n \n42.  Across the seven agro-ecological zones represented by the major regional centers of \nGardez, Herat, Jalalabad, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, and Mazar, the opportunity exists for some \nregional specialization. Such pilot innovations as farmers\u2019 association cold stores, storage, and \nexport marketing in some development partners\u2019 projects indicate that opportunities exist for \nfurther market development. It is essential to use an approach focusing on the critical gaps from \nproduction to market, developing distribution infrastructure. This will require both small and \nlarger-scale infrastructure. The type of infrastructure is expected to range from producers\u2019 and \nfarmers\u2019  associations\u2019  collection  and  packing  houses,  drying  facilities,  small  cold  storage \nfacilities, and logistical support to larger market infrastructure such as slaughterhouses and \nwholesale markets. Feasibility assessment and strategic public\u2013private partnerships will need to \nbe undertaken to address these gaps that affect efficiency, transaction costs, and returns.  \n \n43.  The level of agribusiness expansion in each of the agro-ecological regions will depend \nupon existing enterprise scale and market potential for growth. For the raisin industry, it could \nentail a focus on Kandahar, the Shomali Plains, and Mazar, where the majority of the grapes \nare  produced  and  where  the  13  existing  raisin-processing  plants  are  located. For  the  nut \nindustry,  focus  could  fall  on  the  main  production  regions  including  Kabul-Parwan,  Balkh-\nSamangan,  and  Kandahar-Zabul  and  across  regions  in  targeted  small-scale  infrastructure \ninvestment, technology transfer, and improved practices to improve harvest and postharvest \nhandling and storage to reduce losses and increase sales of fresh fruits, dried fruits, and nuts. \nThe installation of slaughterhouses in Kabul and regional centers would centralize livestock \nslaughtering  and  improve  the  efficiency  and  cost  effectiveness  of  meat  and  by-product \nprocessing and marketing. Profits from carpets could follow increased Afghan trader purchases \nof Ghazni wool, with processing and the expansion of the carpet industry in the key production \ncenters of Faryab, Kabul, Kunduz, Herat, and Mazar, as well as clearer Afghan branding of \ncarpets in international markets.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nProject Title  Duration  Implementing  Development  Approximate\nAgency  Partners  Amount  \n($ million) \nAgriculture Sector Program  2004\u20132014  MAIL  ADB  55.0 \nLoan \nRural Business Support  2007\u20132010  MAIL  ADB  18.0 \nProject \nSupport to Strategic  2003\u20132009  MAIL and MRRD DFID  8.0 \nPlanning for Sustainable \nRural Livelihoods \nHelmand Agriculture and  2006\u20132009  MRRD  DFID  60.0 \nRural Development \nProgram \nPerennial Horticulture  2006\u20132010  MAIL  EC  16.0 \nDevelopment Project \nAfghanistan Seed Industry  2006\u20132011  MAIL  EC  12.8 \nDevelopment Project \nAnimal Health Development  2006\u20132010  MAIL  EC  11.1 \nProject \nNorthern Economic  2008\u20132011  Ministry of Public  German  30.0 \nInfrastructure Development  Works  Financial \nProgram  Cooperation \nAccelerating Sustainable  2006\u20132009  MAIL  USAID  70.0 \nAgriculture Program \nAlternative Livelihoods  2004\u20132009    USAID  475.0 \nProject \nAfghanistan Small and  2006\u20132009  Business  USAID   \nMedium Enterprise  enterprises \nDevelopment \nAfghanistan Rural  2006\u20132009  Financial  USAID  105.0 \nInvestment and Enterprise  institutions \nDevelopment \nEconomic Governance and  2005\u20132010  MOCI  USAID   \nPrivate Sector \nStrengthening \nAfghan\u2019s Building Capacity  2007\u20132012  Multi-ministry  USAID  125.0 \nProgram \nHorticulture and Livestock  2006\u20132009  MAIL  World Bank   \nProductivity Project \nPrivate Sector Development  2007\u20132011  MOCI  World Bank  25.0 \nSupport Project \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFID = Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, EC = \nEuropean Commission, MAIL = Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock, MOCI = Ministry of Commerce and \nIndustries, MOPW = Ministry of Public Works, MRRD = Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, USAID = \nUnited States Agency for International Development. \nSource: ADB staff. \n ", "36          Appendix 5 \n \nMARKET INFRASTRUCTURE SUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA \n \n1.  The priority commodity value chains identified for support are (i) dried fruit and nuts; (ii) \nfresh  fruits  and  vegetables;  and  (iii)  livestock  (red  meat),  hides,  skins,  and  casings.  The \nproposed  Agriculture  Market  Infrastructure  Project  will  undertake  market  infrastructure \ninvestments and provide support to improve the commercial operation of facilities, including the \nadoption  of  improved  postharvest  technologies  and  marketing  practices.  Infrastructure \ninvestments will be in slaughterhouses in Kabul and in three provincial centers; small-scale \ninfrastructure investment in horticultural market distribution systems to address critical gaps \naffecting productivity, product quality, market access, and demand in domestic and regional \nmarkets;  and  the  development  of  improved  laboratories  for  commodity  certification.  The \nproposed Project will target a limited number of commodities and industries in selected areas in \neach of the seven regions that have been identified as production centers.   \n \n1.  Slaughterhouses \n \n2.  The proposed Project will establish slaughterhouses with support facilities for holding \nlivestock; handling such by-products as hides, skins, and casings; and waste management in \nKabul and three provincial cities. The criteria for selecting locations is based on livestock \nproduction and market demand, technical factors including the environment and site availability, \nfinancial and economic viability, and institutional and operational sustainability.  \n \n3.  The preliminary selection is Kabul for two slaughterhouses and three provincial cities, \nHerat, Kundus, and Mazar for one each. Suitable sites are currently being identified in some \nlocations, but the construction of the facilities will start with prepared sites. The slaughterhouses \nwill  be  constructed  using  a  modular  unit  on  land  belonging  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nIrrigation, and Livestock (MAIL), with long-term management and operation to be undertaken by \nprivate entities. Livestock market analysis undertaken as part of the financial and economic \nanalysis in Supplementary Appendix B indicates that a number of major regional centers have \ndemand for a slaughterhouse and that the facilities would be financially viable. A detailed outline \nof  slaughterhouse  structure,  waste  management  systems,  costs,  and  management  and \noperation plan is provided in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n2.  Farm-Level Collection and Marketing Facilities \n \n4.  The proposed Project will establish small-scale horticulture infrastructure investments \nthat  will  include  commodity  collection,  sorting,  and  grading  centers;  drying  facilities; \npackinghouses and small cold storage facilities in production areas to address key constraints \non  efficient  postharvest  handling  and  marketing  that  impede  market  expansion.  These \ninvestments will be undertaken with farmers\u2019 organizations and agricultural cooperatives. They \nwill  have  a  catalytic  role,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be  achieved  through \nimproved postharvest handling and marketing and strengthened linkages between producers\u2019 \ngroups and traders. This investment by the Government of Afghanistan is required to support \nsector growth, as private sector and financial institutional engagement in long-term agribusiness \ninfrastructure  is  very  limited,  especially  in  those  investments  that  involve  producers\u2019 \norganizations.  \n \n5.  Infrastructure investments are expected to range in cost from $20,000 to $75,000. The \nGovernment will fund these investments through the Project, with facilities constructed on MAIL-\nowned land. The facilities will be managed and operated by the farmers\u2019 associations. An \nindicative 200 small-scale market investments are included. Standard designs will be developed \nfor  the  different  types  of  small-scale  infrastructure.  Included  in  the  contract  package  for ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nconstructing these small-scale facilities will be a small component to facilitate their adoption of \nimproved postharvest technologies and marketing practices and for strengthening management \nand operation systems.  \n \n6.  The selection criteria will be based on (i) prioritized commodities under the Project (dried \nfruits  and  nuts,  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables,  red  meat,  hides,  skins,  and  casings)  in  key \nproduction  areas,  (ii)  technical  and  financial  viability,  (iii)  institutional  and  operational \nsustainability of the facility, and (iv) integration with other project activities.  \n \n3.

Approach and Methodology for the Financial and Economic Analysis   \n1.  The financial and economic analysis is based on the quantifiable benefits that will be \nachieved  from  the  investment  in  market  infrastructure  and  product  standards  through  the \nAgriculture Market Infrastructure Project. The financial analysis is based on returns on the \nindividual investments, and the economic analysis is based on the efficiency improvements that \nthese investments will provide and the increased sector returns to the economy. The economic \nanalysis of the slaughterhouses and small-scale market infrastructure is carried out as a single \nunit and then for each subcomponent, including the project management and capacity support \ncosts of delivering the subcomponent, before integration into a single overall project economic \nrate of return. The costs of product standards development and the laboratory investment for \ncertified products are included in the small-scale market infrastructure subcomponent costs. \n \n2.  The overall project economic analysis is based on the with-project incremental economic \nreturn from the improved slaughterhouses in terms of meat and by-product quality and from the \ncommodity market facilities with reduced commodity losses and the improved prices that partly \nreflect commodity quality improvements through postharvest handling in the marketing facilities. \nThe economic return is conservative and it does not include the significant public health benefits \nfrom the hygienic slaughter of livestock in urban areas or from improved food safety. The full \nfinancial and economic analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \nB.  Financial Analysis  \n1.  Slaughterhouses \n \n3.  General  Description.  Under  the  Project,  five  modular  slaughterhouses  will  be \nconstructed in the priority sites identified, two in Kabul and three in provincial cities, under a \nturnkey  contract.  In  addition,  the  contractor  will  provide  management  supervision  and \noperational support during the first year following the commissioning of the slaughterhouses. \nThe proposed modular slaughterhouse is designed to have a slaughtering capacity of 100 large \nruminants and 500 small ruminants per 8-hour shift operating 30 days per month, or a 10-hour \nshift  operating  25  days  per  month.  This  amounts  to  handling  a  minimum  of  3,000  large \nruminants (with 200 kilograms [kg] of red meat per animal) and 15,000 small ruminants (with \n20 kg of red meat per animal), equivalent to 900 tons of red meat per month or 10,800 tons per \nyear. The expected throughput is equivalent to 15% of the large ruminant slaughter and 18% of \nsmall ruminant slaughter in Kabul per year. The facility will reach full capacity on a single shift \nafter 3 years. The potential exists to increase throughput with additional shifts. Using a modern \nfacility that centralizes the slaughter will assist pre- and postmortem inspection; add value by \nrecovering blood; and provide higher-quality hides, skins, and intestines for further processing. \nThe capital costs of the proposed Kabul site in district 18, inclusive of physical contingencies, \nare estimated at $2.9 million and, with inclusion of site infrastructure costs, $3.3 million.   \n \n4.  Enterprise Management and Operation. The facility will be established as a public\u2013\nprivate  partnership,  with  the  investment  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  enterprise \nmanagement contracted by tender to a private entity with one of the two following options: (i) a \nlong-term management contract with an annual service fee estimated at about $139,000 per \nyear  or  (ii)  a  lease-to-purchase  management  contract  with  a  lease  service  charge  of \napproximately  $267,800  per  year.  The  final  fee  paid  will  be  determined  by  the  private \ncompanies as part of the bid process.   ", "  Appendix 11  51 \n5.  Financial Analysis. Analysis indicates that the facility is financially viable. Income is \nestimated based on the daily throughput of 100 large ruminants and 500 small ruminants at a \nper-unit slaughter fee of $12.00 and $2.40, respectively. This charge is assessed as competitive \nwhen  compared  with  existing  slaughter  fees  charged  by  small,  private  slab  slaughtering \nfacilities, which charge between $7.00 and $10.00 per large ruminant.1 The modern facilities will \nmaintain the casing and hide by-products at improved quality for better returns and will produce \nmore  hygienic  meat  products.  At  full  development,  the  annual  cash  net  margin  before \nlease/repayment  fee  is  $562,200,  or  59%  of  turnover.  After  including  the  proposed  lease \nmanagement fee of $139,000, the net margin is $423,200, representing 45% of turnover. For \nthe lease-to-purchase option, the annual net margin is $294,000, or 31% of turnover. The net \ncash margin indicates that the investment as structured would be financially attractive to an \ninvestor and that the private entity tendering for the facility would have the potential to lower \nslaughter fees or meet a higher lease payment and still have a viable enterprise.  \n \n6.  The base case financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 20% before financing for the \nslaughterhouse  investment  indicates  that  the  facility  is  financially  viable.  The  financial  net \npresent  value  is  $520,400  for  15  years,  discounted  at  the  indicative  opportunity  cost  of \ncommercial finance of 15%. The analysis indicates that the FIRR is reasonably robust.  \n \n2.  Farm Collection and Market Facilities \n \n7.  The proposed Project will establish small-scale horticulture infrastructure investments \nthat  will  include  commodity  collection,  sorting,  and  grading  centers;  drying  facilities; \npackinghouses; and small cold storage facilities in production areas to address key constraints \nin postharvest and marketing practices that impede market expansion. These investments will \nbe  undertaken  with  producers\u2019  associations,  farmers\u2019  organizations,  and  agricultural \ncooperatives.  They  will  have  a  catalytic  role,  demonstrating  the  incremental  returns  to  be \nachieved through improved postharvest handling and marketing and strengthened linkages \nbetween  producers\u2019  groups  and  traders.  The  incremental  benefit  translates  into  reduced \npostharvest and processing losses of approximately 20% and the export of approximately 25% \nof the throughput to higher-value markets at prices 10% to 50% higher than the domestic Kabul \nwholesale price. \n \n8.  Representative  market  infrastructure  investments  for  the  small-scale  marketing \ninfrastructure facilities (commodity collection, sorting, and grading centers; treatment facilities; \npackinghouses;  and  small  cold  storage  facilities)  have  been  prepared  for  analysis.  It  is \nanticipated that a wide range of agribusiness investments will be undertaken, and the examples \nused are to indicate the type of investment in priority areas and the potential returns involved. \nDuring project implementation, selection criteria, as detailed in Appendix 5, will be applied.2  A \nfinancial analysis has been prepared. The working capital needs will be sourced from enterprise \nequity, presale of output, forward contracting with agents, and, if possible, from borrowings. \nBased on commercial practice, the enterprises would structure operations to keep working \ncapital needs at feasible levels.  \n \n9.  The indicative types of market infrastructure anticipated and the results of the financial \nanalysis before financing charges are as follows:  \n                                                 \n1  If the butchers pass on the cost of the slaughter fee on to the consumer, the incremental cost of the meat from the \nslaughterhouse is estimated at approximately 1.5%, or AF3 per kg of beef, and 2.5%, or AF6, per kg of mutton. \n2 One criterion is on the financial viability and sustainability of the subproject. \n ", "52          Appendix 11 \n \n(i)  Packing, grading, and cold storage facilities for apples, grapes, and other fruit. \nThe two examples provided are for apples and grapes and involve slightly different \nlevels of investment of $60,000 to $75,000, which covers buildings and equipment. In \nadditional, smaller-scale cold-storage modules for $25,000 to $30,000 are feasible \noptions  for  horticulture.  The  enterprises  operated  by  farmers\u2019  or  producers\u2019 \nassociations  or  agricultural  cooperatives  are  financially  viable.  FIRRs  before \nfinancing are 31% and 68%, respectively.       \n(ii) Raisins.  Sorting,  grading,  and  packing  aftabi  raisins  will  involve  investments  in \nprocessing equipment and building. The model is for processing 1,250 tons per year, \nwith a total investment of $35,000. The enterprise will be managed and operated by \na farmers\u2019 association and is financially viable with an FIRR before financing of 48%. \n(iii) Almonds.  Sorting,  grading,  and  packing  almonds  will  involve  investment  in \nmechanical deshelling equipment and buildings, with an indicative investment of \n$20,000. The enterprise will be managed and operated by a farmers\u2019 association and \nis financially viable with an FIRR before financing of 42%. \n \n10.  The results of the financial analysis show FIRRs of 31% to 68%, which indicate that the \nhorticulture enterprise opportunities are financially viable. The enterprises with export potential \nmay improve upon the base case FIRR if traders increase export sales of improved products or \nsales into new markets for a portion of the annual throughput. The enterprises will generate \nother, unquantifiable benefits in terms of improved hygiene, food safety, and environmental \nmanagement. The sensitivity analysis based on switching values indicates that the enterprises \nare sensitive to export price variations and for two of the enterprise models also sensitive to \nchanges in quantity throughput. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis  \n1.  Slaughterhouses \n \n11.  Assumptions. The economic analysis uses constant mid-2008 prices. The project life \nbase case is assumed to be 15 years, with sensitivity analyses for 10 and 20 years. The \nfinancial costs have been converted to economic costs using a standard conversion factor of \n0.97 to exclude taxes and duties estimated at 3% and a standard conversion factor of 0.80 for \nconsulting services. Unit rates for civil works include materials (30%), equipment and fuel \n(30%), and unskilled labor (40%). In view of the significant levels of seasonal underemployment \nin urban areas, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 has been used in calculating the economic \ncost of civil works and the direct labor costs of operating the slaughterhouse. As is standard \npractice, the derived economic analysis includes physical contingencies but excludes price \ncontingencies. The value of Government land in the Kabul area and the provinces is difficult to \nestimate with certainty, as it is recognized that distortions to values occur because of the \ndifficulties in establishing clear title and ownership and the inflationary impact of cash generated \nin the opium economy, particularly in Kabul. For the economic analysis, it has been assumed \nthat land is valued at $100,000 per hectare in Kabul and $10,000 per hectare in the provinces. \nThe residual value of the slaughterhouse and equipment by year 10 is estimated at 10%. No \nreduction in the value of the land has been incorporated. \n \n12.  With- and Without-Project Situation. The without-project situation is the existing state, \nwhereby live cattle, buffaloes, goats, and sheep are sold by livestock traders to butchers and \nslaughtered in backyards, on improvised private slaughter slabs, or on the street. Provision for \nhanging carcasses is absent or very limited, and the skin is often damaged during skinning a ", "  Appendix 11  53 \ncarcass on the ground more than it would be if it were hung. It is also far more likely for a \ncarcass to be contaminated when slaughtered on the ground and in the skin.  \n \n13.  The with-project situation is with the slaughter facilities and incremental improvements in \nthe regulatory environment and assumes an environment with improved power supplies and \nincreased opportunities for butchers to improve the cool storage capacity of their outlets. The \nquantifiable  economic  benefits  derived  from  the  slaughterhouse  subcomponent  have  been \nidentified as the (i) incremental value of improved quality and more hygienically prepared meat \nthat is produced through the slaughter facility (the assumption is that consumers are willing to \npay for higher-quality and hygienic meat, and the proxy for this value is the cost of the animal \nslaughter, which is passed on to the consumer in the meat price at approximately 1.5%, or AF3 \nper kg); (ii) opportunity cost of the time saved by butchers by using the slaughterhouse; (iii) \nincreased value associated with reduced damage to skins, hides, and casings; and (iv) total \nvalue of blood collected, which, once treated and dried, can be used for chicken feed. Other \nbenefits that have not been included in the economic analysis model include the (i) reduced \nwaste products in streets and public areas and the resulting savings in the municipal costs of \nremoving it; (ii) improved ability of the municipality to enforce legislation requiring the slaughter \nof animals in licensed premises; (iii) increased ability of butchers to comply with public health \nand  hygiene  regulations;  (iv)  improvement  in  public  health;  (v)  jobs  created  during \nslaughterhouse construction and subsequent operation, each requiring up to 20 slaughterers \nper shift; and (vi) increased potential for further value-adding enterprises that utilize the by-\nproducts or provide inputs to the facilities.  \n \n14.  Results of Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) for the slaughterhouse subcomponent over 15 years is estimated at 21%.   \n \n15.  Sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR is very responsive to the incremental value of \nthe meat from the slaughterhouse, which is used as the indicator for consumers\u2019 willingness to \nmeet the full incremental cost. A 20% decrease in the economic value of meat (i.e., a price \nincrement of AF2.6 per kg beef, or 1.2%, and of AF4.8 per kg lamb, or a 2% increase) will \nreduce the EIRR to 17%. An EIRR at this level allows the investment to remain economically \nviable. For this variable, the EIRR has a high sensitivity indicator and a low switching value. A \n20% increase in the economic value of the meat indicates an EIRR of 30%. The corresponding \nlow sensitivity indicator and relatively high switching value for the other variables indicate that \nthe EIRR is considerably less sensitive to changes in these when deriving incremental benefits. \n \n2.  Farm Collection and Market Facilities \n \n16.  Assumptions. The standard conversion factors used to derive economic prices from \nfinancial  prices  are  as  per  those  estimated  for  slaughterhouses.  The  economic  analysis \nassumes the same provincial land value of $10,000 per hectare. The four types of indicative \nenterprise investment to be undertaken are between $22,400 and $70,250, including land cost. \nBased on the four indicative enterprises that have been used in this analysis, the following \nallocation  has  been  used  for  the  distribution  of  the  small-scale  infrastructure  investments: \napples (5%), table grapes (15%), raisins (30%), and almonds (50%). Based on the investment \ncost and this distribution, there would be 160 small market facilities. The phasing in of the small-\nscale infrastructure investments will be from year 2 through year 5 of the Project. \n \n17.  With- and Without-Project Situation. The without-project situation is based on the \nexisting  situation,  with  farmers  selling  in  local  markets  to  traders.  It  further  assumes  that \nindividual small-scale farmers will not be able to reduce harvest and postharvest losses or \n ", "54          Appendix 11 \n \nimprove product quality without collection centers or packing sorting and grading facilities, as \nwell as the absence of improved postharvest technologies to support value addition. And it \nassumes  that  the  existing  regulatory  environment  remains,  with  regional  sales  based  on \nindustry standards in the absence of international certification or sanitary and phytosanitary \nstandards.  \n \n18.  The with-project incremental returns are the quantifiable economic benefits generated by \nthe  improved  market  facilities  that  add  more  value,  by  decreased  losses  of  product  to \npostharvest mishandling and limited sorting and packing, and the improved return from better \nproduct quality. Markets exist for the export and domestic consumption of the incremental \nvolume  and  improved  quality  product.  The  project  investment  is  expected  to  have  a \ndemonstration  effect,  showing  that  small,  strategic  investments  in  similar  civil  works  and \nequipment can add value and return to farmers\u2019 associations and agricultural cooperatives, as \nindicated in the financial enterprise models. Further, traders and exporters with access to larger \nquantities of commodities will have incentives to undertake further value addition.  \n \n19.  Using the four representative models as the basis for the analysis, and given the level of \ninvestment planned, the market facilities will have the capacity to improve the sorting, packing, \ngrading, and storage of approximately 3.5% of the total national throughput of fresh grapes, \n10% of raisins, 12% of almonds, and 1% of apples. The apples will be consumed mainly in the \ndomestic market, though there is opportunity for directly marketing higher-quality apples in \nPeshawar. The other three products\u2014grapes, raisins, and almonds\u2014have established export \nopportunities, but traders have been constrained in developing some export markets by their \ninability to gain guaranteed access to reliable quantities of a certain quality. And they have been \nconstrained  from  further  developing  regional  and  international  markets  by  the  lack  of \ncertification of product quality or sanitary and phytosanitary compliance.  \n \n20.  The with-project situation includes an investment to upgrade laboratories under the \nMinistry of Commerce and Industries with the target of achieving international certification. This \nis in line with the Government\u2019s efforts on national standards and will help strengthen the \nhorticulture subsector as a whole. \n \n21.  Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  at  the  subcomponent  level  is  indicative,  as  returns  on  these  small  market  facility \ninvestments are driven by demand. The final mix of investments will be determined by the \nselection process in year 1 of the Project and will be based on selection criteria including \nfinancial and economic returns. The EIRR for the subcomponent, including the project-related \ncosts of product standard development and certification and project management and capacity \nsupport,  is  48%  over  10  years.  This  indicates  that  the  subcomponent  investments  are \neconomically viable. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to identify the effect of changes \non the EIRR and on the economic net present value of the investment. The sensitivity analysis \nconfirms that the EIRR is not significantly affected by assumptions regarding initial project \nmanagement  costs  or  by  lags  in  implementation.  The  high  FIRR  for  the  representative \nenterprises studied and the high subcomponent-wide EIRR indicate that the subcomponent is \neconomically viable as designed. \n \n3.  Overall Project Economic Analysis  \n \n22.  The project EIRR is 29.5% over 10 years, which indicates that the investment package is \neconomically viable and provides a sound return to the sector and the economy. A lag of 1 year ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nin all planned investment activities reduces the EIRR to 16.7%, which indicates that the Project \nwould remain economically viable.  \n \nD.  Overall Project Distribution Analysis \n23.  Slaughterhouses.  Key  stakeholders  that  will  be  directly  affected  by  the  project \ninvestment in slaughterhouses are the municipalities and the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, \nand Livestock, which will be better able to regulate slaughter in cities; new slaughterhouse \noperators, either private or butchers\u2019 associations; current slaughter operators that, for example, \noperate slaughter facilities adjacent to livestock markets; by-product traders for casings and \nhides; butchers and retailers; and consumers. Indirect stakeholders are livestock farmers and \npastoralists who will see changes in livestock marketing and purchase patterns; consumers of \nthe improved meat; and urban residents that will enjoy public health benefits. \n \n24.  Farm Collection and Market Facilities. Direct beneficiaries include farmers producing \nproducts in the targeted commodities, who will benefit from the proposed farmers\u2019 associations \nand  agricultural  cooperative  market  infrastructure  investments;  traders;  marketers;  and \nexporters. The agribusiness subsector is relatively labor intensive and provides employment for \nsignificant numbers of skilled and unskilled workers. Expansion in the subsector is expected to \ngenerate labor demand in the facilities and additional employment for service providers. The \nadoption of good practices related to product quality and grade standards and compliance with \nfood safety standards will have indirect beneficiaries, particularly domestic consumers. The \nProject will provide technical support to the market facilities on postharvest technologies and \npractices, management, and operation. The main indirect beneficiaries will be consumers, who \nwill benefit from improved access to quality and hygienic horticultural and livestock products. \nService  providers,  including  transporters,  packing  material  suppliers,  and  processing  input \nsuppliers, will benefit from increased demand for their products and services. \n \n \n \n ", "56         Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Afghanistan: Agriculture Market Infrastructure Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nProject  CWRD/CWAE \nModality:  Division: \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government recognizes that employment generation is the key to poverty reduction.a According to the Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy (ANDS), there is a need to sustain high growth rates in the medium term, and such growth will \nreduce poverty and generate employment.b As indicated by the ANDS, more private investment is needed to generate \nemployment. In turn, access to markets, infrastructure, and security, and better protection of property rights are critical \npreconditions for private investment. The rural economy is the major source of employment and income for most Afghans, as \nnearly 80% of the population, or 19 million people, live in impoverished rural areas. Rural economic growth\u2014agricultural \ngrowth, diversification, and value addition\u2014is essential for any sustained improvement in livelihoods. In Afghanistan, informal \nenterprises, mostly agriculture based, are responsible for most private investment and employment and will play the key role \nin economic growth and generating employment. The current shortage of skilled labor harms the competitiveness of domestic \nindustry in comparison with neighboring economies.    \n \nAccording to 2005 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment data, about 45% of rural and nomadic kuchi populations \nappear to be poor, as opposed to 27% of those who live in urban areas.c Rural populations have the highest rates of food \ninsecurity, with 45% not meeting minimum food requirements. In addition to facing high food insecurity, rural households have \nless access to infrastructure and basic public services. Their level of education is low and rates of illiteracy high. Rural \nhouseholds depend heavily on agriculture, though off-farm activity has started to play a bigger role in the coping strategy of \nthe rural poor. \n \nFurther agricultural growth and poverty reduction will depend on agricultural expansion and diversification, which will require \nimprovements in the agriculture value chain from production through processing, packaging, and transport to marketing. In \naddition, higher rural non-farm incomes will help reduce the vulnerability of the poor to the risks inherent in agriculture and \nensure more equitable economic development. \n \nCommercial agriculture priority value chains that have been identified include, but will not necessarily be limited to, dried fruits \nand nuts; fresh fruits and vegetables; wool and carpets; and livestock red meat, hides, skins, and casings. In these prioritized \ncommodity value chains, project support will improve efficiency through improved infrastructure and the adoption of improved \npostharvest technology and management practices and processes. The proposed activities with agribusinesses and farmers\u2019 \nassociations will facilitate growth in production; improve commodity quality; expand capacity to meet demand in export and \ndomestic markets; and improve returns for farmers, traders, and processors. Targeting a limited number of commodities in \nselected areas in each region, and focusing on priority gaps in those value chains, the Project will facilitate and support \ncommercial agricultural development by agribusinesses. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s human development indicators are among the lowest in the world, comparable to those of the poorest \nlandlocked  or  war-torn  countries  of  sub-Saharan  Africa.d  Although  poverty  measurement  in  Afghanistan  is  severely \nconstrained by the lack of quality data, available figures paint a dire picture. Some 12 million Afghans, or 42% of the \npopulation, live below the poverty line, with incomes of about $14 per month per capita. Those unable to purchase sufficient \nfood to guarantee the world standard minimum food intake of 2,100 calories per day are estimated at around 45% of the \npopulation.e In addition, life expectancy in Afghanistan is under 45 years, at least 10 years below that of any other Asian \ncountry. Over 20% of all Afghan children die before the age of 5, half of Afghanistan\u2019s school-age children are not in school, \nand 57% of the population is under 18 years of age, with little hope of full-time employment. In much of the country, over 80% \nof the people are illiterate, and gender inequality is rife across all sectors, resulting in particularly difficult circumstances for \nwomen.f   \n \nThe ANDS strategic vision for agriculture and rural development is to ensure the social, economic, and political well-being of \nrural communities, especially poor and vulnerable people, while stimulating the integration of rural communities into the ", "   Appendix 12           57 \nnational economy. This will require transforming agriculture so that it is more productive and increasingly commercially \noriented and expanding off-farm employment opportunities, thereby increasing rural incomes.g  \n \nSocioeconomic analysis based on social assessment indicates that the Project will improve the living standards of the rural \npopulation by increasing employment opportunities in expanding agribusinesses for semi-skilled and skilled workers, and \nthrough the benefits at the production stage from the adoption of improved postharvest practices and technologies, which will \nimprove productivity, quality, and market returns. These interventions will have a major social impact and reduce poverty.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAgribusiness\u2019s  value  addition  is  estimated  at  $540  million,  largely  through  small-scale  and  cottage  industries. These \nenterprises are family- or village-based and operate with family and local labor, generally with little mechanization. Quality \ncontrol and value added is low. Given the large number of such enterprises, this subsector is a major employer. Although \nmechanized agribusinesses are few, their number is expected to increase. The proposed project interventions will have a \nsignificant impact on small-scale and cottage enterprises, and those participating and adopting improved practices will \ngenerate increased returns. \n \nIn the commodity chains that the Project is proposing to support, the interventions will improve growth, the performance of \nfarmer and agribusiness activities, and the operation of farmers\u2019 associations. These market infrastructure investments will \nadopt improved postharvest technologies and practices that will facilitate expansion and the establishment of new trading and \nprocessing businesses and develop stronger supply lines.   \n \nConstraints on the participation of the poor are likely to be from limited social and political networks, the lack of skills and \nexperience, and limited access to capital for lack of collateral. To address some of these constraints and increase the impact \nof the project on potential beneficiaries, project interventions will enable participation through farmer associations, small-scale \ninfrastructure interventions, and targeted training.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA stakeholder analysis was undertaken as part of the project design. Stakeholders have been involved in project design \nthrough stakeholder workshops in Herat, Kabul, and Mazar, and through numerous meetings held with individuals and groups \nfrom a large range of government and private sector agencies, which has continued during processing. \n \n2.

If no, explain why. \n \nDuring project implementation, project working groups and representatives of associations and private enterprises will have \nopportunities to raise concerns, propose and prioritize project activities, and comment on measures required to enhance the \nbusiness environment. These groups need to include women and men, as well as representatives from different stakeholder \ngroups and wealth categories. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWomen are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, to a lesser extent, in trading agricultural \nproduce.  Under  the  Project\u2019s  strengthening  of  commodity  value  chains  from  harvest  and  postharvest,  there  will  be \nopportunities to support women\u2019s producer associations interested in improving the quality of their produce, thereby enabling \nrural women to benefit. Women will benefit as employees of agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, and members of women\u2019s groups \ninvolved in production or supply. \n \n \n ", "58         Appendix 12 \nAlthough reliable gender-disaggregated data is lacking, Afghanistan\u2019s gender indicators are very poor, as indicated by gender \ngaps in health, education, access to and control over resources, economic opportunity, justice, and political participation. \nWomen are important economic actors, but data is limited as to their contribution and economic role. While Afghanistan\u2019s \nconstitution enshrines women\u2019s equality, progress toward this ideal will take time, given prevailing cultural, social, and \nreligious sensitivities.  \n \n2.

The gender action plan (GAP) aims to ensure that women will be involved in and benefit \nfrom  the  Agriculture  Market  Infrastructure  Project  (the  Project)  by  mainstreaming  gender \nconcerns  throughout  all  its  components.  The  full  GAP  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D. \nWomen\u2019s participation in the Project is expected to contribute to their social and economic \ndevelopment through training and capacity development, support to women\u2019s entrepreneurship \nand leadership, and employment. This is in line with the Government of Afghanistan\u2019s three-\npronged goals on gender: (i) eliminate discrimination against women, (ii) develop women\u2019s \nhuman capital, and (iii) ensure women\u2019s leadership to guarantee their full and equal participation \nin all aspects of life. \n \n2.  Supporting these goals will result directly and indirectly in reduced income poverty and \nfood  poverty  among  rural  and  urban  households.  Participation  in  income-generating  and \nentrepreneurial activities will raise women\u2019s confidence, enhance their social status, and support \ntheir empowerment in decision making in households and villages, regionally and nationally. \nRecent surveys in Afghanistan have confirmed that the poorest households are more likely to be \nthose headed by a single parent, often a woman, and that 67% of female-headed households \nare poor.1 Women-headed households are therefore particularly vulnerable.  \n \n3.  With the support of the Project, women are expected to benefit in several ways from \nagribusiness development, as employees of agribusinesses, entrepreneurs, leaders or partners \nin agribusinesses, and members of women\u2019s groups or associations involved in agricultural \nmarketing. Women are already heavily involved in agricultural production and processing and, \nto a lesser extent, in trading agricultural produce. By starting value chains with the harvest and \npostharvest,  the  Project  has  the  opportunity  to  support  women\u2019s  producer  associations \ninterested in improving the quality of their produce, thus enabling rural women to benefit who \nmay not be able or willing to invest in large, urban agribusiness opportunities, and who may, \nbecause of their geographical location, not benefit from wage work in urban agribusiness plants. \nThe table in Supplementary Appendix D provides indicative estimates. \n \n4.  At this stage in the development of the Afghan agribusiness subsector, it seems unlikely \nthat project-supported slaughterhouses and small-scale marketing infrastructure facilities will \nadversely affect women\u2019s employment in cottage industries and backyard processing. Further, \nmonitoring the impact of the new businesses on cottage industries will be undertaken to assess \nthe livelihood opportunities that Afghan women currently derive from it. There is a risk that \nwomen will be sidelined by agribusiness development, because currently there are few female \nagribusiness professionals in Afghanistan, and very little targeted support is available to women \nagribusiness entrepreneurs. In terms of employment in agribusinesses, it is likely that men will \nbe the main beneficiaries of the Project in terms of training and entrepreneurship, while the bulk \nof women employment generated will be through backward linkages to agricultural production. \nThe Project will therefore make a concerted effort to promote women producers and members \nof farmers\u2019 associations and to increase the benefits that women obtain from employment in \nagribusinesses.  The  project  management  office  will  need  to  adapt  gender-mainstreaming \napproaches  to  the  specific  requirements  of  each  region.  The  Project  acknowledges  that \nsupporting women\u2019s empowerment throughout the Project will require additional resources. \n                                                 \n1  National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 2005, cited in Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \n2006.
