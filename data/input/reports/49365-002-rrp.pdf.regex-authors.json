THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Capital Market \nDevelopment Program. The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) and \nthe  administration  of  TA  to  be  provided  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership \nSpecial Fund,1 the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Developing the Capital Market, and \nif the Board approves the proposed policy-based loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2.  The program will provide budget support for enhancing the role of capital markets in \nfinancial intermediation and resource mobilization by improving the allocative efficiency between \nsavings and investment through the expansion and diversification of the investor base.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Slow  capital  market  development. Government securities, equities, and corporate \nbonds are the key components of Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market. The total size was approximately \n$50 billion or 64% of the gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of 2015. Yet, the capital \nmarket  is  less  developed  than  in  other  middle  income  countries.  Government  securities \ndominate. The market capitalization of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) stagnated as a \npercentage of GDP at about 30% during 2006\u20132015, and there were just eight initial public \nofferings during 2013\u20132015.  The corporate bond market is still in a nascent stage. The ratio of \noutstanding corporate bonds to GDP is 2%\u2014significantly lower than those of other middle-\nincome countries in Asia.    \n \n4.  Opening  for  reform.  From  2006  to  2015,  government  support  for  capital  market \ndevelopment was limited. Governments recognized what needed to be done, but reforms were \npiecemeal largely due to other priorities. For example, although demutualization has been \ndiscussed for over a decade, the CSE is one of the last remaining mutualized stock exchanges \nin  Asia.  It  is  owned  and  dominated  by  brokers  whose  individual  business  interests  take \nprecedence over the exchange and overall market development. However, the government has \nbecome increasingly aware of the need to institute backlogged reforms so that the capital \nmarket can better intermediate savings and investments to drive future economic growth and \nhas approached ADB and other development partners for assistance.  \n \n5.  Limited coordination between the regulators. The opportunities for reform begin with \nthe capital market regulators. The most important of these agencies are the  Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC), the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL), and the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka (CBSL). There is no updated strategic plan for capital market development and no \nforum for the key agencies to coordinate their efforts. The current environment places undue \npressure on the banking sector. Bank assets account for almost 60% of the country\u2019s overall \n                                                \n1  Established by ADB. Financing partner: Government of Luxembourg. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Capital Market Development Program. \n ", "2 \nfinancial assets, and the sector is not the most appropriate nor does it have the capacity to offer \nthe long-term financing essential for private capital investments and infrastructure projects.4  \n \n6.  Weak governance structures. There are also opportunities to strengthen the SEC\u2019s \ngovernance. To improve its internal governance, it will introduce term limits and adopt better \nqualification criteria for recruiting the SEC members. The SEC\u2019s weaknesses as an enforcement \nagency are demonstrated by the fact that more than a fourth of the companies listed on the CSE \ndo not meet SEC listing requirements. The SEC\u2019s automated online market surveillance system \nis limited in that the data extracted from it cannot be used as evidence in court. Poor compliance \nby listed companies with reporting and other SEC requirements deprives investors of reliable \ninformation. This is compounded by the fact that the country\u2019s audit regulator\u2014the Sri Lanka \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Standards  Monitoring  Board  (SLAASMB)\u2014does  not  have  resources \nneeded to properly validate the financial statements of public companies. The educational and \nqualification framework applied by the securities industry is inadequate and leaves the sector \nwithout the human resource capacity needed to execute and benefit fully from capital market \nreform initiatives. This shortfall in knowledge and skills undermines the performance of securities \nand insurance professionals and the level of confidence and interests of retail investors, as well as \nthe integrity of the securities industry and insurance industry. \n \n7.  Limited coverage in mutual fund, pension, and insurance industries. The mutual \nfund industry is characterized by limited subscriptions and a very small share of the economy\u2019s \noverall financial assets. The impediments to greater demand and growth include uneven tax \ntreatment between unit trusts and other financial instruments. Another problem is that the \nmutual fund industry is largely owned by banks that perceive mutual fund subscriptions to be in \ncompetition with their savings deposits. In addition, potential clients generally lack knowledge \nand understanding of the investment benefits of subscribing to mutual funds. The country\u2019s two \nmain pension funds, the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees\u2019 Trust Fund, \nboth invest more than 90% of their assets in government securities. This deprives subscribers of \nthe EPF and Employees\u2019 Trust Fund of the chance to earn better returns through diversifying \ninto  corporate  securities  and  to  intermediate  savings  to  private  enterprise.  The  insurance \nindustry has made only small inroads into the economy. Its investments are spread more \nbroadly  across  the  segments  of  the  capital  markets,  but  it  still  needs  reform.  Insurance \ncompanies should adopt recapitalization measures. The incomplete legal segregation of the life \nand nonlife operations of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest insurance company, the Sri Lanka Insurance \nCorporation, undermines the credibility of the regulator. The absence of a dispute resolution \npanel to address the grievances of policy holders undermines the trust of subscribers. \n \n8.  Increasing  threat  of  fiscal  dominance.  Sri  Lanka  is  experiencing  pressure  that \nprevents the competitive auctioning of government securities based on market prices. It also \nhampers formulation of a credible government yield curve and a liquid bond market. The current \noperating framework of the primary dealer system does not promote competitive bidding. The \nabsence of an auction calendar makes the timing of auctions and the levels of interest rates less \npredictable. This undermines the credibility of the primary market, as does the rejection of \nauction bids and the limited capital of primary dealers. Another major obstacle to the proper \nfunctioning of the primary dealer system is that no high-level committee of CBSL and Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  officials  exists  to  oversee  and  coordinate  on  the  issuing  of  government \n                                                \n4  In addition to licensed banks, nonbank financial institutions such as licensed finance companies and specialized \nleasing companies account for 9%, contractual savings institutions (including Employees\u2019 Provident Fund) for 19%, \nand CBSL for 12%. http://www.cbsl.gov.lk//htm/english/05_fss/pv/f_1.html  ", "3 \nsecurities, including the determination of cutoff yields. The absence of an electronic trading \nsystem to capture all government securities trading prevents the necessary disclosure and \ntransparency. All of these factors contribute to a deficient primary dealer system and point to \nfinancial repression. The development of a secondary government securities market is inhibited \nbecause  primary  pricing  does  not  reflect  market  fundamentals.  The  development  of  the \nsecondary government bond market is also held back by the frequent issuing of government \nsecurities with an average series size too small to allow the creation of liquid benchmark issues. \n \n9.  Elements missing for stronger capital market. Because the credible government yield \ncurve and liquid government bond market necessary for it to function properly are lacking, the \ncorporate bond market is underdeveloped. A market in asset-backed securities is also hindered. \nThis is because no legislation exists to accord them bankruptcy-remote status and tax neutrality. \nThe absence of a central counterparty system and a clearing company for exchange-listed \nsecurities prevents effective management of settlement risk. It also deters the development of \nderivatives because the critical market infrastructure required for netting of transactions is not \navailable.  The  lack  of such  hedging  instruments  and mechanisms  are  an  obstacle  to risk \nmanagement. The introduction of derivatives trading with a focus on plain vanilla instruments \nand under close supervision by the SEC is needed to support a more efficient and liquid capital \nmarket. Structured products, such as mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, \nshould be developed through the enactment of a securitization act to diversify the number of \nfinancial instruments available. The depth and breadth of the capital market have also been \nrestricted in that many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have not been listed on the CSE.  \n \n10.  Future potential. The government knows that it must take several important steps to \npromote investment and achieve greater and more sustainable GDP growth. It can remove \ncurrent obstacles to this growth by moving toward measured market-based structural reforms \nthrough deregulation of the financial system while laying the foundations to ensure financial \nstability  and  resilience.  The  crucial  steps  are  the  strengthening  of  the  existing  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks, continuing improvements in the market\u2019s infrastructure, and empowering \nsuch institutions as the SEC, the IBSL, and the EPF. Creating an efficient, reliable capital \nmarket is a prerequisite for attracting more foreign investment. Most foreign investors require a \ngood enabling environment and market depth before they will gain the confidence to invest. \nCapital market reforms will be an important complement to Sri Lanka\u2019s relatively open trade \nregime and to the port of Colombo, which is South Asia\u2019s largest and busiest. \n \n11.  Thrust. To address these constraints, the government and ADB have agreed to anchor \nthe Capital Market Development Program to the government\u2019s long-term national capital market \nstrategy, which ADB worked with the government to design. In addition, a crucial first tranche \npolicy action was formulated under the program to build strong (i) ownership at the highest level \non the policy front, and (ii) coordination across the agencies. \n \n12.  The program will seek to deepen and broaden Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market by (i) extending \nthe government yield curve and thereby promoting a more liquid government bond market and \neventually a more developed corporate bond market; (ii) catalyzing institutional investor demand \nby broadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; (iii) strengthening the institutional \nand  regulatory  capacity  of  the  SEC,  the  IBSL,  the  EPF,  and  SLAASMB;  (iv)  developing \nimportant market infrastructure such as a surveillance systems, trading system, and information \nand communication technology systems; (v) enhancing capacity development through training \nand  promoting  financial  literacy;  and  (vi)  enhancing  the  supply  of  alternative  financial \ninstruments such as derivatives to include for commodities and securitized bonds.  \n \n ", "4 \n13.  The program will support financial inclusion by promoting financial literacy among retail \ninvestors, expanding mutual funds, and developing consumer protection in the insurance sector \nthrough its adoption of grievance mechanisms. \n \n14.  Linkage between reform program and budget support. The structural reforms to be \ntaken  under  the  program  include  costly  measures,  such  as  the  costs  of  a  significant \nenhancement in the regulatory and enforcement capacity of the SEC and the IBSL and of a \nshort-term increase in the rates of treasury bills and government bonds to align them more with \nmarket  rates.  Budget  support  is  crucial  under  the  program  to  help  cover  the  costs  of \nimplementing the reforms. Since the reforms are an integral part of the government-owned long-\nterm national capital market strategy, the government is firmly committed to instituting the \nactions under the Capital Market Development Program and has the ability and political will to \nimplement the needed reforms (Appendix 3). \n \n15.  ADB  value  addition.  The  government  and  ADB  have  conducted  extensive  policy \ndialogue on capital market development since the early 1990s, and this close engagement has \nmade ADB the lead development partner in this effort.5 ADB\u2019s strength in supporting capital \nmarket development is its ability to take an integrated approach to helping develop, guide, and \ncarry out policy change. The approach covers (i) policy dialogue, (ii) the structure and design of \ntailor-made policy reforms, (iii) policy implementation support, (iv) capacity development through \nTA  to  ensure  sustainability,  and  (v)  procurement  of  information  technology  systems  to \nstrengthen operations. ADB has the high level of credibility, the means, and the capacity to offer \nthis comprehensive solutions-based approach, which can tailor best practices to the needs of \nand conditions of Sri Lanka. Given the complexities, resource and expertise requirements of \nsuch reforms, they may be further delayed, be carried out piecemeal, or not happen at all \nwithout ADB\u2019s involvement. \n \n16.   ADB\u2019s commitment to supporting capital market development in Sri Lanka is long-term, \nand successful implementation of this program will create an environment conducive to follow-\non reforms. Demutualization of the CSE will allow for its subsequent public listing. Greater retail \npenetration of the insurance sector is still a priority. This program creates the preconditions for \npension reforms, and a follow-on program could support their implementation. Private pension \nplans and the establishment of a pension regulator are needed. The reform and public listing of \nSOEs  is  a  multiyear  undertaking.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  current  efforts  to  establish  an  international \nfinancial center may require external support. The derivative market will need years to develop, \nand the establishment of a commodities exchange would provide agricultural producers with a \nway to mitigate price and other risks. \n \n17.  Development coordination. ADB has worked to closely coordinate its capital market \ndevelopment  activities  with  those  of  other  development  partners  and  to  complement  their \nefforts. ADB\u2019s program is part of an umbrella operation to support economic recovery led by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2016, the IMF approved an extended fund facility of \n                                                \n5  Since 1993, ADB has approved 15 technical assistance projects supporting capital market development in Sri \nLanka and two major programs, one in 2000 and the second in 2004. This support helped build the reform \nmomentum that has led to the Capital Market Development Program. Under the last program, ADB provided a $65 \nmillion loan to Sri Lanka in 2004 for (i) increasing the financial products and services available to capital markets, \n(ii) enhancing corporate governance in the financial markets, and (iii) improving regulations of the insurance \nindustry. (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. \nManila). ", "5 \n$1.5  billion  for  Sri  Lanka  that  aims  to  restore  macroeconomic  stability.6 The  World  Bank \napproved a $100 million development policy loan in July 2016, with the Japan International \nCooperation Agency providing another $100 million of parallel financing.7 The World Bank\u2019s \npolicy effort focuses on private sector competitiveness, governance, and macro fiscal stability. \nIn December 2016, the World Bank is expected to approve a second policy loan for $75 million \nthat will operationalize key recommendations formulated under an IMF\u2013World Bank financial \nsector assessment program concluded in June 2016. Along with the World Bank and the IMF, \nthe  United  States  Treasury  and  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  are \nproviding  important  advisory  support that  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  program;  ADB  has  been \nclosely coordinating with these organizations. \n \n18.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy and lessons learned. ADB\u2019s finance sector strategy \nfor Sri Lanka, which is part of its country partnership strategy and country operations business \nplan, is based on the government\u2019s emphasis on private sector development, lessons from \nADB\u2019s previous finance sector interventions, and coordination with other development partners.8 \nCapital and bond market development is in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nmidterm review and its financial sector operational plan. Both aim to facilitate private sector \ndevelopment and infrastructure development by helping increase the availability of long-term \nlocal currency funds for viable financial structures.9 \n \n19.  The program will build on lessons from findings of a 2008 study by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department. 10  In line with the evaluation study report\u2019s key recommendations, its \nprospects  for  achieving  maximum  efficiency  and  effectiveness  have  been  improved  by  (i) \nlimiting the number of policy actions to allow for effective monitoring; (ii) formulating a long-term \ncapital market strategy as a first tranche policy action to ensure that the program is an integral \npart of a government-owned, long-term development strategy; (iii) adopting a holistic approach \nincluding the inclusion of insurance and pension areas; and (iv) consulting comprehensively with \nstakeholders through a national workshop to effectively diagnose the issues and build greater \nownership for the development of a strong, relevant proposed policy matrix.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact will be that basic capital and investment needs, as well as Sri Lanka\u2019s \nlonger-term economic objectives, are supported. The outcome will be enhanced size, depth, \nand capacity of the capital market. The program has 13 first tranche policy actions and 17 \nsecond tranche policy actions. \n \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2016.

Outputs \n \n21.  Market facilitation enhanced. Enhancing market facilitation will support more efficient \nmobilization and allocation of resources in the economy. The program will help develop a long-\nterm vision for the capital market by formulating a cabinet-approved Capital Market Strategy \n(Appendix 5), institutionalizing interagency coordination, enhancing the SEC\u2019s role in developing \nand  monitoring  the  market,  strengthening  regulatory  measures,  developing  a  clearing  and \nsettlement system, pursuing demutualization of the CSE, strengthening enforcement of listing \nrequirements at the CSE, and enhancing financial literacy.12 \n \n22.  A  Capital  Market  Advisory  Council  at  the  strategic  level  and  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Division at the SEC will ensure the successful implementation of the government\u2019s \nmultifaceted  Capital  Market  Strategy.  The  development  of  a  real-time  market  surveillance \nsystem will help the SEC detect trading irregularities and market abuse as they occur. This \nsystem  will  make  market  transactions  more  transparent  and  enhance  investor  confidence. \nImproving the operational and financial efficiency of the SLAASMB will strengthen compliance \nwith auditing standards. This too will build market confidence by making reliable public company \ninformation available on which potential investors can base their investment decisions. \n \n23.  Issuing risk-based capital rules for intermediaries and the subsequent implementation of \na recapitalization plan will consolidate the number of intermediaries in the industry and ensure \nthat those remaining will be adequately capitalized. The CSE\u2019s demutualization will segregate \nits  ownership  and  management  and  convert  the  exchange  into  a  commercial  and  more \nprofessionally  run  organization  that  can  pursue  market  development  with  more  vigor. \nEstablishing a clearing and settlement system for SEC-listed securities will eventually enable a \ncentral  counterparty  entity  to  guarantee  the  settlement  of  these  securities.  The  SEC  will \nenhance  its  educational  and  qualification  framework.  This  will  include  changes  to  enable \nqualified market intermediaries to deal with a variety of asset classes, as well as to enhance \nfinancial literacy and outreach to retail investors for mutual funds.  \n \n24.  Demand measures enhanced. The policy actions linked to this output will support the \nmobilization  of  capital  market  financing  by  developing  liquid  bond  markets,  expanding \ninstitutional investor demand, and promoting mutual funds. To develop a liquid bond market and \na reliable yield curve, the government will become a price taker by issuing treasury bills and \nbonds at market rates. The CBSL will publish a rolling 12-month quarterly Treasury auction \ncalendar and will execute a strategy to create liquid benchmark issues by reducing the number \nof issues as well as increasing the average size of issues. Creation of liquid benchmark issues \nwill  facilitate  secondary  bond  market  activity.  To  support  a  resilient  primary  government \nsecurities market, the CBSL will ensure compliance with capital adequacy requirements for \nprimary dealers. A committee chaired by the MOF and comprising representatives from the \nMOF and the CBSL will be established to oversee government securities issuance procedures.  \n \n25.  A robust mutual fund industry will be promoted under the program by adoption of a \nlegislative  amendment  to  remove  tax  distortions.  The  amendment  will  allow  unit  trusts  to \nbecome tax neutral. The EPF\u2019s capital market participation will be spurred by implementation of \nits new information and communication technology system. Insurance industry participation in \nthe capital market will be enhanced through measures to promote the industry\u2019s growth and \nstability. These will include enforcement of compliance with the minimum capital requirements, \n                                                \n12 Sri Lanka Capital Market Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nestablishment  of  a  dispute  resolution  panel  to  hear  policyholders\u2019  grievances,  the  legal \nsegregation of the life and nonlife operations of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest insurance company, and the \nformulation and implementation of a comprehensive strategy for retail education. These steps \nwill in turn enhance investor demand.  \n \n26.  Supply measures enhanced. The changes tied to this output will increase the supply of \nquality bonds and alternative financial instruments. Partial listing of SOEs on the CSE will \nbroaden and deepen the capital market. The corporate bond market will be catalyzed through \nthe implementation of quotes for corporate securities citing yield to maturity, which is a more \nuseful  indicator  to  investors  than  bond  prices.  Alternative  financial  instruments  such  as \nderivatives will be promoted to develop a deeper and broader capital market by focusing on the \nenabling regulatory framework. The introduction of regulations for issuing derivatives and the \nenactment of a securitization act will together encourage the development of such instruments \nas interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and asset-backed securities. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n27.  The  program  loan  will  be  $250  million,  which  will  be  made  available  in  two  equal \ntranches. Tranche 2 will be released about 18 months after disbursement of tranche 1. The \ntranche amounts reflect the materiality of policy actions required for release of each tranche with \ntranche 1 having fewer but more pivotal policy actions such as the submission of an SEC and a \ndemutualization bill to parliament. The first tranche will be available upon loan effectiveness. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s financial support addresses the development financing needs. In particular, the \ncounterpart fund generated out of the loan proceeds will finance development expenditures in \nthe  form  of  the  costs  of  the  adjustments  involved  in  undertaking  the  reforms  agreed  for \nimplementation  under  the  program  and  necessary  to  achieve  the  intended  outputs.  The \nestimated cost of these adjustments is $260 million, and the government has requested a loan \nof $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance these costs.13 The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and program agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and no \nmaturity premium is payable to ADB.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The executing agency will be the MOF. The implementing agencies will be the SEC, the \nMOF,  the  CBSL,  the  IBSL,  the  SLAASMB,  the  EPF,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise \nDevelopment, and the Ministry of Labor. The SEC\u2019s Capital Market Development Division has \nbeen tasked as the program management unit. A Capital Markets Advisory Council chaired by \nthe senior advisor to the prime minister and established as a first tranche policy action will \nmonitor the program. The deputy secretary to the Treasury will be the executing director. The \nprogram will be implemented over 3 years from January 2016 to December 2018. \n \n30.  Tranches, disbursement, and counterpart funds. The loan will be provided in two \ntranches and disbursed upon fulfillment of the related program policy actions (Appendix 4). The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n                                                \n13 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  with  the \ngovernment.14 The  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items, \nexcluding items included in a list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources.15 ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify \nthe accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n31.  The attached TA for Developing the Capital Market will support the implementation of \nkey reforms under the program.16 The outputs to be supported through the TA activities will be \nthe  (i)  facilitation  of  the  demutualization  of  the  CSE;  (ii)  development  of  a  multilayered, \nmultiproduct financial certification framework for brokers; (iii) enhancement of financial literacy \nand outreach for unit trusts; (iv) support of a legal review of the unit trust code and related \nlegislation; (v) support of a legal review and the drafting of a securitization act; (vi) support of the \nestablishment of a derivatives market; (vii) formulation of a strategy for the development of a \ncommodities exchange; (viii) assessment of the options for reforming the current system for \nretirement savings; (ix) enhancement of the EPF\u2019s capacity for managing risk in alternative \ninvestments and foreign equities; (x) support of the establishment of a dispute resolution panel \nfor insurance cases; and (xi) deepening of financial literacy regarding insurance products. \n      \n32.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund (footnote 1), and \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and \nadministered by ADB. The executing agency for the TA will be the MOF. The SEC, the Ministry \nof Labor, the CBSL, the IBSL, and the EPF will be the implementing agencies. The TA will be \nimplemented over 2.5 years starting in December 2016. ADB will engage consultants through a \nconsulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The  program  will  facilitate  the  mobilization  of  financial  resources  for  productive \ninvestment and employment generation by supporting the development of the capital market. By \nstrengthening the capital market, it will reduce systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated \nfinancial system. By promoting the development of the corporate securities market, mutual funds, \nand  institutional  investors  such  as  insurance  companies  and  the  public  pension  funds,  the \nprogram will diversify the financial instruments available and broaden the investor base. This will \nreduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the finance sector to external shocks. In \naddition, by strengthening governance of the capital markets, the program will enhance market \nefficiency and transparency and improve investor protection. \n                                                \n14  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n15  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n34.  Public financial management governance systems are adequate. The MOF has been \nmodernizing its management and operations, including its administration of the national budget. \nThe program will advance these efforts by publishing rules for primary auctions, developing an \nauction  calendar  for  government  securities,  and  establishing  a  committee  for  the  strategic \nmanagement of public debt under MOF. The government has national guidelines on selection and \nemployment  of  consultants  that  were  issued  in  2007.  In  the  absence  of  a  codified  public \nprocurement statute, these guidelines have the force of law. The guidelines are comprehensive \nand broadly aligned with those of multilateral agencies. Sri Lanka signed the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption and is part of the ADB\u2013Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development anticorruption initiative. Its legal framework for bribery and corruption is fairly \ncomprehensive, but there are implementation gaps, and the country ranks 83rd in the perception \nof corruption. In 2009, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka issued the Sri Lanka \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards. These were based on the standards of the International \nFederation of Accountants and introduced accrual accounting. The program will strengthen Sri \nLanka\u2019s policy and legal framework by helping to prepare and submit a proposed SEC bill to \nParliament. It will strengthen regulatory capacity through the attached TA. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nimplementing  agencies.  Implementation  of  the  program  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nImplementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.17 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.  Financial crises disproportionately harm those in society with the fewest resources to \nmitigate their impact. Capital market reforms under the program will help provide investors with \nadditional  investment  opportunities  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  financial  market  instability. \nDiversification away from a predominantly bank-based system of financial intermediation will \nexpand alternative sources of credit, helping to limit the systemic impacts of economic shocks. \nCapital markets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector that results in lower \nborrowing costs. The capital market reforms to be pursued through the program will help Sri \nLanka diversify its financial system so that the country can realize its broad-based economic \ngrowth and socioeconomic development objectives, including poverty reduction. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s evaluation of the program-supported capital market reforms showed that they will \nhave no direct or indirect environmental impacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and \nwill  have  no  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  The  program  is classified  as  category  C for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The  program\u2019s  overall  risk  rating  is  medium.  This  is  because  (i)  ADB  has  solid \nexperience in the sector in Sri Lanka; (ii) the MOF, which will be the executing agency, has a \ngood performance record in project implementation; and (iii) the program is unlikely to have any \nimpact on safeguards. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the following \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2014.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made for a tranche unless ADB is satisfied that the \ngovernment has completed the relevant policy actions specified in the program\u2019s policy matrix. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $250,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Capital Market \nDevelopment Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and program agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n30 September 2016\n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
