The  state\u2019s  renewable  energy \ninvestment  plan  aims  for  a  total  of  about  8,000  MW  of  solar  and  wind  generation  capacity  by \n2018\u2014largely  private  sector.3 These  include  private  solar  and  wind  power  projects  planned \nprimarily  for  the  renewable  energy  resource-rich  districts  of  western  Rajasthan  in  Jodhpur, \nBikaner,  Barmer,  and  Jaisalmer.  One  such  project  is  a  solar  power  generation  park  being \ndeveloped in Bhadla by the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation, the state nodal agency \nfor  renewable  energy.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  support  the  development  of \nfacilities to transmit renewable energy from western Rajasthan to the state and national grids.4  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nBackground.  India has an annual electricity deficit of 8%, and nearly 350 million of its \n3.  \npeople  have  no  access  to  electricity.  The  country  is  increasingly  dependent  on  fossil  fuel \nimports  of  coal  and  gas  to  generate  electricity. 5 In  its  Integrated  Energy  Policy  2006, 6 the \ngovernment estimated that India needed to alter its energy source mix and  increase electricity \ngeneration fivefold by 2032 to meet projected demand. Due to its tropical location, some regions \nin India benefit from solar irradiation ranging from 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours per square meter of area. \nThe  solar  irradiation  available  in  the  western  regions,  particularly  in  the  desert  regions  of \nRajasthan, is at the higher end of this spectrum. India also has significant wind potential in its \nwestern  region.  These  advantages  have  led  to  India\u2019s  decision  to  invest  in  renewable  energy \nparticularly in the state of Rajasthan.  \n \n4.  \nPolicy framework and institutional arrangements. The federal and state governments \nhave  sound  policy  frameworks  and  strategies  for  developing  renewable  energy,  which  the \nIntegrated Energy Policy sees as a way to meet India\u2019s two goals of improving energy security \nand  expanding  the  use  of  clean  energy  to  meet  fast-rising  electricity  demand.  Solar  energy \ndevelopment  is  an  important  part  of  the  government\u2019s  2008  National  Action  Plan  for  Climate \nChange, and the government launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) \nin  2010  to  create  an  enabling  framework  to  deploy  20,000  MW  of  solar  power  generation \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Financed  by  the  Clean  Technology  Fund.  The  CTF  is  a  $5.2  billion  fund  providing  middle-income  countries  with \nresources  to  scale  up  demonstration,  deployment  and  transfer  of  low-carbon  clean  technologies.  India\u2019s  CTF \ninvestment  plan  was  endorsed  in  November  2011  by  the  CTF  trust  fund committee.  CTF  financing  approvals for \nthe investment program were received on 29 July 2013.   \n\n3  This capacity is expected to be developed by the private sector to supply to utilities within and outside Rajasthan.  \n4   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila.  \n\n5   The country currently imports 15%\u201320% of the coal used to generate its electricity.  \n6   Government of India. Planning Commission. 2006. Integrated Energy Policy. New Delhi. \n\n\f2                       \n\ncapacity  across  India  by  2022.  The  government  of  Rajasthan  has  followed  suit  with  its  own \nframework through adoption of a solar policy in 2011 and a wind policy in 2012. These policies \nemphasize  private  and  public  sector  investments,  including  partnerships,  to  shorten  the \ndevelopment  timeline,  reduce  development  costs,  facilitate  replication  and  address  scale  up \nissues  encountered  with a  stand-alone  project  approach. The  Rajasthan  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission has set renewable energy procurement obligations for the distribution utilities in the \nstate and is regulating the workings of the electricity transmission and distribution companies.7  \n \nRoad  map.  India\u2019s  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy  aims  to  add  nearly  30,000 \n5. \nMW  of  wind  power  and  10,000  MW  of  solar  power  capacity  over  2012\u20132018  in  renewable \nenergy  rich  states  including  Rajasthan.  Nearly  1,000  MW  of  solar  power  capacity  has  been \nawarded under phase 1 of the JNNSM, and this is expected to significantly rise under phase 2 \nof  the  JNNSM  that  will  be  implemented  starting  2013. 8  For  Rajasthan,  the  total  installed \nrenewable  energy  capacity  of  wind  and  solar  is  expected  to  reach  8000  MW  by  2018.  In \nRajasthan,  the  state\u2019s  renewable energy  investment  plan  includes  establishment  of renewable \nenergy  parks,  solar  and  wind  generation  projects,  transmission  and  smart  grid  facilities, \nassociated  infrastructure,  and  community  power  schemes.  The  renewable  energy  park  model \nconceives replicable private sector projects being set up at a single location to generate and sell \nrenewable  energy.  Rajasthan\u2019s  use  of  the  park  model  is  expected  to  accelerate  investment  in \nrenewable  energy  generation  because  the government  will  provide  the  infrastructure  including \ntransmission facilities for electricity for plant construction, roads, site development, and security. \nIt  will  also  facilitate  permits  and  allocate  land.  Development  of  privately  owned  generation \nprojects  would  be  financed  by  financial  institutions  such  as  the  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment  Agency.  The  park  model  marks  a  departure  from  traditional  approaches  to \ndeveloping renewable energy projects and achieves greater economies of scale. \n \n6. \nThe  state  government  has  mandated  Rajasthan  Rajya  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam  Limited \n(RRVPNL), the public sector electrical transmission licensee in Rajasthan, to transmit the power \nproduced from wind and solar renewable energy projects in the state. In addition to private solar \nphotovoltaic projects, the solar park in Bhadla will also host concentrated solar thermal projects. \nThe state government\u2019s overall investment plan for renewable energy development amounts to \nmore  than  $11  billion  during  2012\u20132018.  About  $9.5  billion  of  this  amount  would  be  for \nrenewable energy power generation mainly from the private sector, while more than $1.6 billion \nwould be invested in transmission and financed from various sources, including ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment program.9  \n \nThe  policy  framework,  road  map,  and  investment  program  for  renewable  energy  in the \n7. \ncountry and the state of Rajasthan are fully consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy for the energy sector \nand ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy for India for 2013\u20132017, which supports renewable \nenergy development, expanded transmission systems, and institutional strengthening.  \n \n8. \nMultitranche  financing  facility.  In  May  2010,  ADB  announced  the  Asia  Solar  Energy \nInitiative  to  catalyze  3,000  MW  in  solar  energy  projects  through  innovative  public\u2013private \npartnerships. ADB\u2019s operations departments have been active through public and private sector \nsupport  in  this  strategic  space  for  some  time.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  have  financed \n\n                                                \n7  The utilities in Rajasthan are required to procure 5.7% of their overall power needs from wind power projects and \n\n1.0% from solar power projects during 2013\u20132014. \n\n8  More than 800 MW of capacity awarded under phase 1 of the JNNSM is in Rajasthan and in advance stages of \n\n9  ADB estimates based on government plans for 5,700 MW of renewable energy capacity addition by 2018 (para 5).  \n\nconstruction. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nstand-alone  solar  power  projects  across  India,  including  projects  in  Rajasthan.10 ADB  support \nfor  the  public  sector  activities  has  been  provided  mainly  through  financing  for  transmission \nfacilities. This included support for the transmission infrastructure for solar parks in the state of \nGujarat in 2010. The pipeline of renewable energy projects is strong and growing. \n  \n9. \nThe  Government  of  India  and  Rajasthan  requested  support  from  ADB  for  the \ndevelopment of renewable energy projects in Rajasthan, including in its planned solar parks, as \nwell  as  financing  through  an  MFF  to  set  up  transmission  and  associated  infrastructure  to \nmanage  integration  of  renewable  energy.  The  preconditions  for  the  use  of  the  MFF  are  all  in \nplace\u2014a  road  map  and  strategy,  a  policy  framework,  investment  and  financing  plans,  and \nreliable  safeguard  arrangements.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  most  suited  to  a  long-term \npartnership  in  these  activities,  given  the  phased nature  of  investments  in  electricity generation \nand the need for flexibility in project design and implementation. It is also possibly the best way \nto provide continuity when trying to combine investments in physical and nonphysical aspects of \nrenewable energy development. An MFF allows  the Rajasthan government and ADB to spend \nmore time on implementation work.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  the  accelerated  development  of  renewable  energy  sources  in \nRajasthan  and  India.  The  outcome  will  be  the  achievement  of  a  cleaner  electricity  mix  and  a \nmore efficient and effective generation and transmission system in Rajasthan.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nPhysical  outputs  will  include the  construction  of  the  bulk  power  transmission  system  in \nwestern Rajasthan. The bulk  power  transmission  system  include  the  construction  of  three grid \nsubstations  (400  kilovolt  [kV])  and  nine  grid  substations  (220  kV)  and  associated  facilities; \naugmentation  of  four  400  kV  grid  substations  and  three  132  kV  substations;  and  the \nconstruction  of  about  1852  kilometers  of  400  kV,  220  kV,  and  132  kV  of  transmission  lines \nprimarily in western Rajasthan. Nonphysical outputs include developing institutional capacity for \nrenewable energy parks and transmission systems (see also para. 17).  \n \n12. \nProject 1 will include physical and nonphysical investments. Physical investments will be \nfor construction of the bulk power transmission system in western Rajasthan, including: two 400 \nkV  grid  substations  and  associated  facilities  in  Bhadla  and  Ramgarh;  two  220  kV  substations \nand  associated  facilities  at  Bap  and  Kanasar;  augmentation  of  two  400  kV  grid  substations  at \nAkal and Bikaner; upgrade of three substations to 132 kV in Bhadla; and construction of almost \n600 kilometers of 400 kV, 220 kV, and 132 kV transmission lines in Bhadla and Ramgarh. The \nnonphysical outputs comprise project management and capacity building. Project 1 will finance \nthe  costs  to  prepare  future  MFF  investments  and  supervise  the  first  generation  of  capital \ninvestments.  \n \nD. \n \n13. \nPrivate sector led investment under Rajasthan\u2019s renewable energy investment plan will \nbe supported by public sector transmission network investment under the investment program. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2011.

The financing plan (table 2) includes $300 \nmillion from ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR), $198 million loan and $2 million grant from \nthe  ADB  CTF,11 to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  MFF  will  be  drawn  down  in  three  tranches, \nsubject  to  the  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  loan  and  project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first  tranche  amounts  to  $150  million\u2014$62  million \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR and $88 million from the ADB CTF. Financing from ADB\u2019s OCR will have a 25-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  a  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on these loan terms and the \nrepayment method, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.10% per annum. The ADB CTF loan financing comes with a 40-year term, including \na grace period of 10 years, an annual interest rate of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.18% per \nyear,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. \nThe remaining financing will be mobilized by RRVPNL, including debt from lenders and equity \nsupport  from  the  government  of  Rajasthan.

Private  sector  investment  proposals  and  the  related  bidding \nprocess  will  be  handled  by  a  committee  of  secretaries  from  the  government,  supported  by \nRREC.  Project  management,  preparatory  work  for  future  subprojects,  and  implementation \nsupport will be financed by the Rajasthan government. \n \nProcurement.  Goods,  equipment,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \n16. \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nRRVPNL  has  undertaken  advance  procurement  actions,  including  the  placement  of  bidding \ndocuments in the market and requested that ADB authorize these actions and allow retroactive \nfinancing.    RRVPNL  will  follow  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  public \nsector transmission  investments.  Private  sector  renewable  energy  developers  selling  power  to \nutilities will be selected through a competitive process and will enter into supply contracts with \ntheir clients.12 The construction of their facilities will most likely follow turnkey contracts selected \nthrough  a  competitive  process.  RREC  will  coordinate  with  RRVPNL  on  the  choice  and \nsequencing  of  the  development  of  transmission  lines  to  evacuate  the  renewable  energy \nproduced  in  the  region,  including  that  from  wind  and  solar  parks.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  facility  administration \nmanual.13 Retroactive financing  will  be  allowed  for  up to  20%  of  the  individual  loan amount for \nexpenditures incurred 12 months prior to loan signing. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n12 Private sector bidding began for  phase 1 of the Bhadla solar park in 2013 under the Rajasthan solar policy.

These \nassessments  covered  technical  and  commercial  matters.  ADB  also  conducted  its  own \nindependent due diligence on these projects including climate risk assessments.16 \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nSeveral  technical  studies  on  the  renewable  energy  roll  out  plan  and  transmission \nevacuation  requirements  were  prepared  by  RRVPNL  and  reviewed  by  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority  and  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy.  The  work  focused  on  technology \naspects,  the  nature  and  characteristics  of  the  investment  plans,  and  the  most  appropriate \n                                                \n14 Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n15 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Based on the results of studies \n\nundertaken under the TA, additional support could be considered in subsequent tranches of the MFF. \n\n16 Climate change adaptation report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nelectricity evacuation arrangements and renewable energy integration proposals. ADB followed \nup  these  assessments  with  its  own  and  found  the  technical  studies  acceptable.  TA  for  the \nCapacity Development of Rajasthan Solar Park provided support to RREC for the studies for the \nestablishment of the first phase of the Bhadla solar park.17 The work undertaken indicated that \nthe sequencing of the generation developments under the investment plan and of transmission \nunder  the  investment  program  is  technically  feasible  and  execution  arrangements  are \nsatisfactory.  A  road  map  for  renewable  energy  integration  for  RRVPNL  will  be  refined  under \nproject 1 and implemented under the investment program. Support for the development of the \nmaster plan for the second phase of the Bhadla solar park will commence starting 2013 under \nthe TA associated with project 1.  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe  due  diligence  process  included  an  assessment  of  the  likely  level  of  investor \nparticipation  in  renewable  energy  projects  in  Rajasthan,  including  in  the  Bhadla  solar  park. \nBidding  for  1200  MW  of  wind  power  will  be  carried  out  to  meet  the  requirement  of  Rajasthan \ndistribution utilities till 2016 under the state wind policy. Under the JNNSM, at least 3,000 MW of \ncapacity is to be competitively bid out by 2017 and a significant slice of which is expected to be \nin  Rajasthan.18 Procurement  for  75  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic  power  at  Bhadla  solar  park  for \nRajasthan distribution utilities was completed in 2013. 200 MW of solar power capacity is to be \ntendered out annually during 2014\u20132018 at the Bhadla solar park. In addition, private generating \nenterprises  are  setting  up  wind  and  solar  projects  to  supply  power  purchasers  outside \nRajasthan through long-term contracts and renewable energy certificates. Due diligence shows \nthat private sector generation projects are financially viable with demand from private operators \nwith sufficient access to finance in India and elsewhere (footnote 10). The financial analysis for \nthe  transmission  infrastructure (a  prerequisite  and  integral  part  of  the  overall  investment  plan) \nwas  conducted  using  standard  ADB  approaches.  It  was  found  to  be  viable,  with  the  financial \ninternal rate of return for project 1 at 2.1% and a weighted average cost of capital of 1.1%.19  \n \n21. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  investment  program  and  project  1  compares  benefits \nand costs under with- and without-investment scenarios.20 The evaluation found project 1 to be \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of about 16.4%. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nADB  conducted  an  assessment  of  RRVPNL\u2019s  governance,  including  its  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  capacities.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded \nthat RRVPNL has the ability to fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. RRVPNL has a procurement \nunit  of  more  than  40  qualified  staff.  This  team  has  the  capacity  and  experience  to  handle \ninternational competitive bidding operations and is familiar with ADB rules and procedures. ADB \nprovided  support  to  RRVPNL  in  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  the  first  set  of \ninvestments, and RRVPNL staff have participated in ADB procurement seminars. RRVPNL has \nset up a project management unit to report on the investment program.  \n \n23.   An  empowered  committee  comprising  senior  secretaries  of  the  state  government  has \nbeen  set  up  to  finalize  clearances  of  solar  and  wind  power  projects.  RREC  will  support  this \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n17  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Rajasthan Solar Park Capacity Development Project . Manila. \n18 Under the JNNSM, 3,000 MW\u20139,000 MW of solar power is expected to be commissioned during 2013\u20132017. \n19  Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Economic Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8                       \n\ncommittee and report on the performance of private sector-led investments. RREC will oversee \nthe  private  generation  program  and  report  on  it  to  government  authorities  and  through  the \nproject management unit to ADB. \n \n24.   Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB reserves the right to examine and review directly any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, \nor  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  MFF  and  the  projects.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government,  RRVPNL  and  other  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual.21  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25.  \nIndustry and services constitute more than 60% of Rajasthan\u2019s gross domestic product. \nThe state registered high growth rates of 8.5% during 2007\u20132012. The power sector plays a key \nrole  in  contributing  to  economic  growth,  development,  and  social  well-being.  The  growth  of \nrenewable  energy  in  Rajasthan  will  directly  and  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by \ncreating temporary and permanent jobs and enhancing energy security.  \n \n26. \nA socioeconomic and poverty assessment was carried out along the transmission routes \nand in the area of the substations identified for support under project 1, as well as in the vicinity \nof  phase  1 of the  Bhadla solar  park. These  areas  lack  basic  infrastructure  and  other  services, \nincluding  access  to  good  quality  water  supply,  medical  facilities,  and  electricity.  Economic \nactivity and growth is weaker than it should be due to a lack of income-generating opportunities, \nthe  low  skill  levels  of  the  local  population,  and  limited  access  to  markets.  The  investment \nprogram will create economic opportunities. A gender action plan has been prepared for project \n1. The plan includes interventions to support sustainable, socially inclusive development in the \nareas  adjacent  to  renewable  energy  parks.  As  part  of  its  responsibilities,  RREC  has  set  up  a \ncommunity  development fund  by  levying  an  upfront  nominal fee  on  renewable energy  projects \nthat will support social development projects. The TA associated with project 1 will support the \nexecuting  agencies  in  making  the  community  development  fund  operational  and  support \nlivelihood  opportunities.  The  loan  agreement  includes  a  commitment  from  the  executing \nagencies to implement the gender action plan. The TA will enhance the impact of the renewable \nenergy investment plan through effective community development and gender mainstreaming.    \n\n \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nAn  environment  assessment  and review  framework,  a  resettlement  framework,  and  an \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  were  prepared,  outlining  the  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  principles  and  requirements. 22  RRVPNL  will  undertake  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  due diligence  on  individual  investments  based  on  the  environment  assessment  and \nreview  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework,  and \nsubmit  quarterly  reports  on  implementation  of  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs), \nresettlement plans for projects, and if required, indigenous peoples plans.  \n  \n28. \nProject  1  investments  are  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  Major  components \nproposed include supply and installation of transmission substations and transmission lines. The \nconstruction work is limited to building foundations for the transmission towers and substations. \n                                                \n21  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Environment  Assessment  and  Review  Framework;  Resettlement  Framework;  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\nBased on the environmental assessment and surveys conducted by RRVPNL, potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts of this work are minimal and can be mitigated through implementation of \nthe  EMP.  Budgetary  provisions  have  been  made  to  cover  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring requirements, and the EMP is part of the bidding documents. RRVPNL will supervise \nthe  construction  contracts  and  EMP  implementation.  The  initial  environmental  examination  for \nProject 1 was disclosed on ADB website. \n \n29. \nProject  1  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  Social  surveys  and  consultations  were  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Project  1  will  not  entail  any  permanent  land \nacquisition.  The  proposed  grid  substations  will  be  built  on  government  land.  The  transmission \nlines will have a temporary impact at some locations through disruption of crop cultivation during \nconstruction. This will be also minimal, since the transmission routes are mostly through vacant \nland.  Project  1  will  not  have  any  social  risks  or  impacts  of  a  permanent  or  irreversible  nature. \nDue diligence was also undertaken for the Bhadla solar park, and the results are included in an \nappendix  of  the  resettlement  plan. 23  Budgetary  provisions  have  been  made  to  compensate \naffected  people  for  these  losses  if  and  when  they  occur.  There  are  no  structures  or  buildings \naffected,  and  no  physical  displacement  is  foreseen.  The  loan  agreements  include  a  standard \nassurance related to core labor standards for contractors (including equal pay for equal types of \nwork), and an awareness program on HIV/AIDS, and sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, \nthe  social  impact  assessment  provided  baseline  information  for  the  gender  action  plan.  The \nresettlement plan for Project 1 was disclosed on ADB website. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  major  risks  are  (i)  lack  of  coordination  in  the  development  of  renewable  energy \n30. \ngeneration and transmission, (ii) potential technical problems integrating renewable energy with \nthe transmission network, and (iii) poor financial performance by RRVPNL. Coordination issues \nwill be addressed by a state government committee while the MFF modality provides flexibility \non the transmission investment roll out in subsequent phases. The integration requirements are \naddressed  under  the  renewable  energy  integration  road  map  under  the  investment  program. \nAssurances  regarding  the  financial  sustainability  of  RRVPNL  have  been  provided.  Risks  and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n \n\nRisks \nPossible lack of \ncoordination between \nthe development of \nrenewable energy \ngeneration plants and \ndevelopment of the \ntransmission system \n\nLow utilization of the \ninfrastructure in the \nBhadla solar park  \n \n\nPotential difficulties in \nmanaging possible grid \n\nMitigating Measures \nEmpowered committee of government secretaries to coordinate the planning and \ndevelopment of generation and transmission systems.  \nCentral government agencies, including CEA, and the state regulator, to periodically \nreview plans.
