An initial environmental examination was completed for a \ncore  subproject,  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework was prepared.  \n \nThe  primary  objective  of  the  sector  Project  is  to  develop  rural \nelectrification  and  renewable  energy  in  Viet  Nam  to  benefit  ethnic \nminority  communities  inhabiting  remote  and  poorer  parts  of  the \ncountry. The Renewable Energy Development and Network Expansion \nand  Rehabilitation  for  Remote  Communes  Sector  Project  consists  of \ntwo  investment  components:  (i)  mini-hydropower  plants  in  mountain \nprovinces, and (ii) network expansion and rehabilitation of distribution \nnetworks serving poor provinces.  \n \nComponent  1  of  the  Project  will  develop  about  5\u201310  grid-connected \nrun-of-river  mini-hydropower  plants  with  7.5  megawatts  (MW)  or  less \ncapacity,  totaling  30  MW  in  Lai  Chau,  Dien  Bien,  and  several  other \nprovinces in northern and central Viet Nam. Electricity connections will \nbe  provided  to  about  60\u201375  villages  in  poor,  remote  ethnic  minority \nareas  in  northern  Viet  Nam,  and  about  100  gigawatt  hours  (GWh)  of \nrenewable  energy  to  the  national  grid.  The  Project  will  provide  a \nsustainable financing mechanism to remote mountainous provinces in \nunderdeveloped provinces in northern and central Viet Nam to finance \nrural  electrification  through  revenues  from  the  sale  of  electricity, \ngenerated using renewable energy resources, to the national grid.  \n \nComponent  2  of  the  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing \nspecial  program  of  supporting  rural  electrification  of  poor  provinces \ninhabited by ethnic minorities by which the Government provides 85% \nof the funding and EVN 15%. The Government is providing more than \n$70  million  to  regional  power  distribution  companies  of  Viet  Nam \nElectricity  (EVN)  to  electrify  more  than  100,000  households  in  five \nprovinces in the Central Highlands. The Government intends to extend \nthis  program  to  five  more  provinces  in  the  northern  mountain  areas \n(i.e.,  Dien  Bien  and  Lai  Chau),  Mekong  Delta  (Tra  Vinh  and  Soc \nTrang), and central Viet Nam (Quang Tri). This is estimated to require \nabout $90 million; the proceeds from component 2 will be allocated for \nfinancing the Government\u2019s program in these additional five provinces. \nApproximately  100,000  poor  households  in  about  1,000  villages  are \nexpected to receive electricity under this component.  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nin \n\nrecently \n\nremote  areas.  However, \n\nThe Project will include an associated technical assistance (TA) grant \nfor capacity building for renewable energy development.  \n \nAccess  to  electricity  increased  rapidly  in  Viet  Nam  from  51%  of \nhouseholds  in  1996  to  more  than  91%  in  2008.  In  2007,  more  than \n97%  of  the  country\u2019s  communes  were  connected  to  the  national  grid. \nHowever,  278  communes  are  not  yet  connected.  The  Government\u2019s \nlong-term  development  strategy  for  rural  electrification  envisages  a \ncombined  effort,  with  EVN  taking  responsibility  for  extending  the \nmedium voltage network to rural areas, and the provincial and district \nauthorities  taking  a  lead  role  in  investing  and  operating  low  voltage \ndistribution  systems \nthe \nGovernment  decided  to  transfer  the  development  of  low  voltage \nnetworks  to  EVN  to  expedite  the  electrification  of  remote  parts  of  the \ncountry populated by poor and vulnerable ethnic minorities.  \n \nComponent  1  of  the  Project  promotes  the  use  of  renewable  and \ndistributed  energy  sources  to  provide  electricity  to  these  remote \ncommunes.  The  development  of  mini-hydropower  projects  in  remote \nparts  of  northern  Viet  Nam  will  reduce  generation  at  polluting \ncentralized  thermal  power  plants,  and  reduce  transmission  and \ndistribution  losses.  These  mini-hydropower  plants  are  expected  to  be \nconnected  to  the  national  grid,  thus  providing  (i)  additional  clean \nenergy to the national grid, (ii) access to electricity to remote areas and \n(iii)  a  sustainable  financing  source  for  further  rural  electrification  from \nrevenues  generated  by  selling  electricity  generated  by  mini-\nhydropower  plants  to  the  grid.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the \ninstitutional development of renewable energy and rural electrification. \n \nThe rapid roll-out of Viet Nam\u2019s rural electrification during 1993\u20132005 \nwas  facilitated  by  (i)  EVN  taking  responsibility  for  extending  medium \nvoltage \nis  an \nadministrative  entity  in  Viet  Nam  with  5\u20136  villages  and  about  1,000\u2013\n2,000  households),  and  (ii)  local  residents  acting  through  village \norganizations  (i.e.,  cooperatives)  taking  responsibility  for  the  low \nvoltage  network.  However,  this  approach  has  resulted  in  poorly \nconstructed  low  voltage  networks  with  poor  service  quality  and  high \ndistribution  losses.  Many  villages  without  electricity  are  officially \nclassified as electrified when only the commune center is provided with \nelectricity.  Component  2  of  the  Project  is  to  expand  the  rural \ndistribution  network  to  connect  villages  without  electricity  and  to \nrehabilitate  the  existing  poorly  constructed  low  voltage  networks \nserving poor communes. The use of Asian Development Fund funding \nand  concessionary  onlending  terms  and  state  budget  transfers  from \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  to  regional  executing  agencies  is \njustified  for  the  Project,  based  on  the  low  per  capita  investment  and \nlow consumer density in rural areas that result in low financial returns \nto the utility.  \n \n\nto  commune  centers \n\n(i.e.,  a  commune \n\nlines \n\n\f \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  pro-poor  and  balanced \neconomic  development  of  remote  mountainous  communes  and  poor \ncommunes  through  the  sustainable  use  of  electricity  and  renewable \nenergy in an affordable manner. \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  is  provision  of  reliable  and  affordable \nsupply of electricity to remote mountainous and poor communes.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $197.6  million \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $20.0  million.  The  total  cost  includes \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges \nduring implementation. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a \nloan  of  SDR  102,161,000 \n($151,000,000  equivalent)  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  to \nfinance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year maturity, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, a 1% interest charge during the grace period \nand 1.5% during the amortization period.

ADB  will  administer  the  associated  TA  grant.  The \nconsultants  will  work  closely  with  MOIT  to  provide  policy-related \ntechnical  support,  and  with  the  executing  agencies  to  support  project \nimplementation. \n\n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Contracts for works valued at more than \n$2 million equivalent will be procured through international competitive \nbidding.  Small  packages  of  works  valued  at  less  than  $2  million \nequivalent,  but  more  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  works  less  than \n$100,000 equivalent, shopping procedures may be used. Contracts for \ngoods  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding.  Goods  costing  less  than \n$500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000 will be procured through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  Smaller  packages  for  goods  valued  at \nless than $100,000 may be procured through shopping procedures.  \n \nThe  consulting  services  requirement  of  technical  and  safeguard \nsupport  for  subproject  preparation  will  be  provided  through  the \nassociated  TA  grant.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  these  consulting \nservices  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  the  residents  of  communes \ntargeted  to  receive  access  to  electricity  under  the  Project.  Access  to \nreliable  and  affordable  electricity  supply  will  contribute  to  improved \nquality of life; reduced indoor air pollution; increased time available for \nleisure,  income  generation,  and  educational  activities  in  the  targeted \ncommunes.  Availability  of  electricity  will  have  a  major  impact  on \nimproving the productivity of industrial and commercial activities. This \nwill  result  in  general  improvement  of  the  commune\u2019s  economy  and \nimprove  the  incomes  and  living  conditions  of  residents.  In  remote \nmountain  areas,  the  availability  of  electricity  to  ethnic  minority \ncommunities  will  facilitate  provision  of  social  services,  such  as  health \nand education, in a more efficient manner. \n   \nThe  mini-hydropower  plants  will  provide  the  bulk  of  the  generated \nelectricity  to  the  national  grid.  This  will  be  an  inexpensive  and  clean \nsource  of  electricity  for  the  distribution  network,  reduce  transmission \nand distribution losses, and improve the voltage profile of the network. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  reducing  the \ngeneration  at  centralized  thermal  power  plants  because  of  the \ncontributions  of  the  mini-hydropower  plants.  To  improve  the  financial \nviability  of  the  subprojects,  these  global  environmental  benefits  are \nexpected to be captured through the Clean Development Mechanism.  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nThe  project  design  assumes  that  the  executing  agencies  will  form \nprovincial  joint-stock  companies  to  take  over  operation  of  the  mini-\nhydropower projects financed under the Project. These entities will be \nprovided  with  capacity  building  during  project  implementation  through \nthe  associated  TA  grant.  The  newly  set  up  joint-stock  companies  are \nassumed  to  have  the  necessary  technical  expertise  to  operate  the \nmini-hydro plants in a satisfactory manner. \n \nThe  hydrological  risk  will  be  minimized  by  collecting  on-site field  data \nfor  a  minimum  of  12  months  and correlating  with  adjacent river  basin \nlong-term  data  during \ntechnical  design.  The  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  will  be  undertaken  by  technical  consultants \nrecruited  under  the  associated  TA  grant.  The  financial  viability  of  the \nmini-hydropower projects critically depends on the feed-in tariff to the \nnational  grid.  The  Government  has  instituted  a  feed-in  tariff  regime \nbased on the avoided cost of generation in the national power system. \nThis is assumed to provide adequate financial return to the joint-stock \ncompanies. No major social or environmental risks are associated with \nthe  Project  as  the  mini-hydro  projects  to  be  included  are  required  to \nmeet  the  environment  and  resettlement  categorization  B  or  C.  The \nresources are made available to promote productive use of energy in \nmountain areas to increase the societal benefits of the Project to poor \nand vulnerable ethnic minority communities.   \n \nAn  advisory  TA  will  be provided  to MOIT  and  the  executing  agencies \n(PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3) for the Capacity Building of Renewable Energy \nDevelopment. The TA, comprising of three separate components, will \n(i)  prepare  a  renewable  energy  law  to  promote  development  of \nrenewable energy through appropriate fiscal and policy incentives; (ii) \nprovide  capacity  building  in  sustainable  small  hydropower  plant \nplanning,  implementation  and  operation,  including  preparations  for \nCDM  registration;  and  (iii)  promote  productive  use  of  energy  and \nincome  generation  activities in  mountain  areas.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated at $2.9 million. The TA will be financed through the Climate \nChange  Fund  ($1.6  million)  and  the  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund  ($0.9  million).

The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nViet  Nam  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  in  Asia  for  the  last  two \ndecades,  with  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaging  about  8.0%  per  annum \nduring 2003\u20132007; per capita GDP increased to $817 in 2007 from $441 in 2002. Although the \ncountry has experienced high inflation due to energy and food price and supply problems, long-\nterm  growth  prospects  remain  positive.  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  remarkable  progress  in \nsocioeconomic development since 1993. The reduction of national poverty from 58% in 1993 to \nless than 20% by 2007 is unprecedented. However, the poverty rate remains at more than 50% \nin  northern  mountain  provinces  inhabited  by  ethnic  minority  communities.  The  lack  of \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  nonfarm  income  generation  activities  are  major  contributors  to  the \npersistent poverty in these isolated areas.  \n \n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  by  2010  is  outlined  in  the \nSocio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006\u20132010 approved by the National Assembly \nin  2006.  The  SEDP  acknowledges  the  critical  importance  of  environmentally  sustainable, \nequitable,  and  regionally  balanced  pro-poor  growth  to  maintaining  the  achievements  of  Viet \nNam\u2019s  socioeconomic  development.  Although  the  recent  global  financial  crisis,  domestic \ninflationary  pressures,  and  the  Government\u2019s  corrective  measures  are  expected  to  slow  GDP \ngrowth to around 6%\u20136.5% during 2008\u20132010; Viet Nam will likely achieve the socioeconomic \ntargets set in the SEDP. The country strategy and program for Viet Nam 2007\u201320101 prepared \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is closely aligned with the SEDP and ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020).  It  promotes  inclusive  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth  through  investments  in  rural  infrastructure  to  remove  development  barriers  in  poorer \nregions of the country. It also encourages promoting environmentally sustainable investments, \nespecially in the energy sector through cleaner and renewable forms of energy.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n4. \nThe power generation capacity of Viet Nam increased by more than 50% during 2002\u2013\n2007  to  reach  over  13,000  megawatts  (MW);  it  needs  to  double  in  the  next  5  years  to  meet \nprojected annual demand growth of 15% during 2008\u20132012. However, with the recent economic \nslowdown in Viet Nam, GDP growth for 2008 is expected to slow to 6.5% from estimated initially \n8.5%, likely resulting in a reduction of power demand growth to around 12%. Viet Nam\u2019s present \ngeneration capacity is insufficient to meet dry season demand. The power shortage in the dry \nseason  is  more  than  1,500  MW  due  to  lower  capacity  in  hydropower  plants.  While demand  is \nessentially  driven  by  industrial  load  growth,  residential  power  consumption  is  also  increasing. \nDuring the last 5 years, performance of the power industry has been good, with sound financial \nperformance,  reduced  system  losses,  and  service  quality.  The  detailed  analysis  of  the  power \nsubsector is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB, 2007, Country Strategy and Program for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010, Manila. \n\n\fAccess of households to electricity has increased rapidly in Viet Nam from 51% in 1996 \n5. \nto over 91% of households in 2008. The Government\u2019s long-term development strategy for rural \nelectrification  envisages  a  combined  effort,  with  Viet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN)  taking  the \nresponsibility  for  extending  the  medium  voltage  network  to  rural  areas,  and  the  provincial  and \ndistrict  authorities  taking  a  leading  role  in  investing  and  operating  low  voltage  distribution \nsystems  in  remote  areas.  More  than  97%  of  the  country\u2019s  communes  are  connected  to  the \nnational  grid.  However,  278  communes  in  mountain  areas  in  the  northern  and  central  regions \nand eight island districts are not yet connected. Regional variations in the electrification rate are \nsignificant:  the  northwestern  and  northeastern  regions  have  low  rates  of  electrification. \nProvincial rates of household electrification are 36% in Lai Chau, 58% in Dien Bien, 58% in Ha \nGiang, and 65% in Cao Bang. Poverty rates in these provinces are also significantly higher than \nthe  national  average  due  to  lack  of  productive  investment  opportunities  and  underdeveloped \ninfrastructure.    \n \n6. \nThe electricity supply mix of Viet Nam is dominated by conventional sources with large \nhydropower  accounting  for  32%,  gas  46%,  and  coal  17%.  Renewable  energy  comprising \nbagasse  cogeneration  and  small  hydro  (i.e.,  less  than  30  MW)  contributes  only  1.5%  of  total \nelectricity generation. As a result of several recent policy reforms, the contribution of small grid-\nconnected hydro is changing quickly; the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) identified more \nthan  42  operating  projects,  70  under  construction,  and  a  pipeline  of  more  than  200  identified \nprojects.  Some  380  small  hydro  projects  (less  than  100  kilowatts)  have  been  built  in  remote \nareas  to  provide  local  electricity  supply  where  grid  connections  are  absent.  Most  of  these  off-\ngrid schemes are run by cooperatives and operate with various degrees of success (at least one \nthird are no longer in operation, and are in various stages of abandonment). Many of these off-\ngrid supplied villages are provided with grid electricity. A policy framework is needed to facilitate \nthe connection of existing off-grid mini-hydropower plants to the grid.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges for Power Sector Development \n\n7. \nMeeting  Demand  Growth.  Viet  Nam's  electric  power  industry  faces  tremendous \nchallenges. To maintain the growth momentum of a rapidly industrializing economy, a massive \nexpansion of the power system is required over the next decade. At the same time, the country \nis  embarking  on  a  major  power  sector  reform  program,  designed  to  establish  new  institutional \narrangements,  restructure  the  dominant  vertically  integrated  electricity  utility  (i.e.,  EVN),  and \ngradually  develop  a  competitive  power  market.  Policy  makers  face  major  challenges  from \npressure  to  meet  soaring  power  loads,  to  urgently  mobilize  investment  for  new  capacity \nconstruction, and to ensure that the new corporate configurations and institutions being created \nfor the reformed and restructured power industry will best serve long-term needs. \n \n8. \nMobilizing  Investment.  Funds  for  investment  must  be  mobilized  from  all  sources, \nincluding  greater  self-financing  from  the  domestic  power  industry  itself  and  large-scale \ndevelopment  of  independent  power  producers.  Total  power  sector  investment  requirements \nwill exceed $3 billion per year during the next 10 years. Mobilizing this financing and scaling \nup  project  implementation  is  an  immense  challenge  for  the  country.  EVN's  substantial \ninvestments  in  generation  capacity,  transmission  and  distribution  network,  and  a  portion  of \nrural  low-voltage  distribution,  will  total  $2.4  billion\u2013$2.5  billion  per  year  (in  constant  terms). \nAlthough  the  bulk  of  investments  are  in  generation  capacity  additions,  transmission \ninvestments  will  continue  to  be  substantial  in  2008\u20132010,  as  EVN  seeks  to  complete  the \ntransmission  backbone  in  main  load  centers  in  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  The  power \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fdistribution sector does not require major investments. However, additional investments are \nrequired  to  improve  service  quality  and  extend  the  coverage  in  more  remote  parts  of  the \ncountry.   \n\n \n\n2. \n\nKey Opportunities and Challenges in Rural Electrification   \n\n9. \nThe first challenge in bringing access to electricity to the remaining households without \nelectricity is resource mobilization, which must be considered in the context of the overall scale \nof  investment  requirements  for  the  power  sector.  Nongovernment  sources  of  finance  and \ndomestic bond issuance to supplement EVN\u2019s own resources relate mainly to power generation \nand transmission projects. In particular, foreign direct investments are targeted at larger thermal \npower plants, and local private sector investments support small and medium-sized hydropower. \nThe  investment  requirement  for  rural  electrification  and  network  expansion  to  reach  100% \nelectrification  in  the  country  from  the  current  91%  requires  total  investments  in  the  range  of  \n$3 billion over the next 10 years. Due to the unattractive financing returns of rural electrification, \navailability of concessionary financing will remain a critically important factor. \n \n10. \nFor some poor provinces (Central Highlands) where the connection rate is significantly \nbelow  average,  the  Government  has  introduced  a  special  program  to  promote  rural \nelectrification.  Under  this  program,  85%  of  the  cost  is  provided  from  the  state  budget  to  EVN \nand  15%  is  borne  by  executing  agencies  through  their  own  resources.  However,  how  to \nmobilize the necessary resources in a sustainable manner over the next 10 years remains the \nmain  issue.  A  rural  electrification  fund  has  been  proposed  as  a  mechanism  for  cross-\nsubsidization of rural power distribution due to high cost structures inherent to low load densities \nof urban consumers. The existing mechanism of cross-subsidy through adjustments in the bulk \nsupply tariff to EVN power distribution companies is not transparent and will have to be phased \nout with the introduction of the competitive generation market in 2010. \n \nThe  second  challenge  is  institutional  reform.  About  two  thirds  of  the  low  voltage \n11. \ndistribution  networks  in  rural  areas  are  owned  by  local  distribution  units  (LDUs),  comprising \nvillage  cooperatives  and  other  consumer  organizations  that  receive  electricity  from  EVN\u2019s \nmedium-sized voltage system. The LDUs are responsible for operation and maintenance of the \nlow  voltage  systems,  billing,  and  collections.  Until  2004,  many  LDUs  consisted  of  commune \nelectricity  groups  and  other  informal  entities,  which  are  now  required  to  become  formal  legal \nentities  (cooperatives  or  joint-stock  companies).  They  require  consolidation  and  capacity \nbuilding to develop into efficient commercial utilities capable of providing good quality electricity \nsupply to rural areas. Due to the poor performance of these entities, the Government recently \ndecided to transfer the low voltage networks to EVN in a phased manner, and entrust EVN with \nthe responsibility of extending low voltage networks in areas inhabited by poor ethnic minorities. \n  \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities and Challenges for Renewable Energy Development  \n\n12. \nThe  Government  recently  established  a  policy  framework  to  facilitate  development  of \nrenewable  energy  generation  projects  by  requiring  EVN  to  purchase  electricity  based  on \nstandard  power  purchase  agreements  using  the  avoided  cost  of  power  generation.  The \nprospects  for  attracting  significant  private  investment  into  renewable  energy  generation  have \nimproved  as  a  result.  While  the  large  state-owned  enterprises  and  foreign  investors  focus  on \nlarge  thermal  and  hydropower  generation  projects,  smaller  joint-stock  companies  will  need  to \nplay a growing role in small hydro schemes (less than 30 MW) if the very ambitious targets set \nby  the  sixth  power  development  master  plan  are  to  be  met  (2,500  MW  of  renewable  energy \nincluding small hydropower plants [less than 30 MW] by 2015, and 3,000 MW by 2020). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n13. \nThe realization of this challenge will depend upon several issues yet to be satisfactorily \nsolved. Viet Nam\u2019s track record in attracting carbon finance into the small hydro sector is poor \n(particularly  when  compared  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India),  with  only  two \nprojects  approved  for  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).  Financing  of  small \nhydropower projects through the commercial banking system is still largely confined to balance \nsheet  lending  rather  than  project  finance  and,  more  importantly,  rarely  offering  loan  tenors  of \nmore than 10 years. Without tenors of around 15 years, inadequate debt service coverage ratios \nwill  prevent  project  financing.  While  international  financial  institutions  can  potentially  provide \nlonger  loan  terms,  the  amount  of  such  support  from  domestic  commercial  banks  will  remain \nlimited.  \n \nThe prospects for other grid-connected technologies are less certain. The tariff required \n14. \nto make wind projects financially viable is more than double that provided by the avoided cost \ntariff,  and  providing  subsidy  support  to  such  projects  has  little  justification  given  the  large \nunexploited  resource  potential  of  small  hydropower  and  biomass.  Some  biomass,  especially \nbagasse cogeneration and wind, may be enabled by the likely increase in avoided cost tariff due \nto changes to Viet Nam\u2019s fuel mix in power generation and increasing use of imported coal and \ngas  for  power  generation.  However,  in  the  short  term  these  technologies  will  require  subsidy \nsupport. Such support depends upon a sustainable source of revenue, particularly if lenders are \nto view the subsidy revenue as credible. For this reason, a renewable energy fund is proposed, \nfunded  by  a  universal  charge  (as  in  the  Philippines)  levied  on  electricity  consumption,  and \nanchored in a proposed new renewable energy law.  \n \nThe  greatest  challenge  concerns  the  use  of  renewable  energy  for  off-grid  rural \n15. \nelectrification. Network expansion in the remaining un-electrified areas implies costs exceeding \n$0.50/kilowatt  hour  (kWh)  because  of  small  loads.  Thus  micro-hydro  (i.e.,  less  than  200  kW \ncapacity)  based  schemes  are  generally  the  least  cost  option.  Experience  with  isolated  small \nhydropower  plants  operated  by  district  authorities  has  not  been  good  (paras.  20\u201321).  Another \nissue is how to ensure the financial sustainability of the schemes due to low demand and poor \npayment  history.  Options  are  to  provide  support  for  a  district  or  provincial  operation  and \nmaintenance support entity; or bundle the sales from the mini-hydropower plants to the grid as \nproposed in the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n\nA  comprehensive  government  strategy  for  renewable  energy  is  articulated  in  the \n16. \nrenewable  energy  master  plan,  the  draft  of  which  is  presently  under  consideration  by  the \nGovernment, and is expected to be approved during 2009. The next stage of this strategy is the \nenactment of renewable energy law, incorporating the key recommendations of the renewable \nenergy master plan and this would be supported by the technical assistance component of the \nproposed Project. While several possible options for funding have been proposed (including the \nuse of a natural resource tax and consumption tax on electricity and petroleum uses) under the \noverall  direction  of  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  of  Viet  Nam,  efficient  disbursement  of \nsubsidies  will  be  a  main  challenge.  In  the  case  of  grid-connected  renewable  energy  projects, \nsubsidies are proposed to be given only to technologies with costs below the economic avoided \ncost  (around  D1,100/kWh),  but  above  the  financial  avoided  cost  (around  D700/kWh).  This  will \nenable biomass, landfill gas, and bagasse cogeneration to receive subsidies from the proposed \nrenewable  energy  fund.  The  renewable  energy  master  plan  proposes  that  these  subsidies  be \ncompetitively bid out.  \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fAchieving  the  100%  electrification  target  will  be  constrained  mainly  by  availability  of \n17. \nresources. Many of the areas with low electrification rates are ethnic minority areas. The Project \nwill  make  a  significant  contribution  to  these  efforts  by  supporting  rural  electrification  in  the \nremote  mountain  areas  in  the  north  and  central  regions,  as  well  as  in  the  poor  parts  of  the \nMekong Delta in south, by financing the Government\u2019s efforts to extend grid electrification. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy is outlined in Appendix 3. \n\n \n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to Renewable Energy and Rural Electrification  \n\n18. \nExternal assistance to the power sector is outlined in Appendix 4. External assistance to \nrenewable  energy  has  focused  on  off-grid  electrification  mainly  through  small  hydro  projects \n(World Bank Remote Area Rural Electrification with a scheme in Muong Te; Viet Nam\u2013Sweden \nrenewable energy program with four pilot projects). A World Bank project for financing a private \nsector grid connecting small hydro projects (Renewable Energy Development Program) through \ncommercial banks will start in 2009; and as part of preparation of this Project, the World Bank \nsupported  some  of  the  policy  reforms  to  encourage  renewable  energy  development  (i.e., \nstandardized power purchase agreement based on avoided cost tariff). The Government of the \nNetherlands  is  supporting  a  program  to  encourage  household  use  of  biogas  for  cooking  and \nlighting. \n \nThe  World  Bank  has  led  the  external  assistance  for  rural  electrification.  The  Rural \n19. \nElectrification I project (completed in 2007 with a total investment of $150 million) financed the \nconnection of more than 500,000 households. Rural Electrification II (commenced in 2006 with \n$200  million,  supplemented  with  an  additional  $250  million \nthe \nstrengthening of EVN\u2019s medium voltage network to support rural electrification, rehabilitation of \nexisting low voltage systems owned and operated by LDUs, and development of institutions and \nparticipants  to  ensure  service  delivery.  The  Rural  Distribution  project  (approved  in  2008  with \n$150 million) focuses on improving medium voltage systems (22 kilovolts [kV] and 35 kV) and \nsupports the corporate development of the power company.  \n\nin  2008)  addresses \n\n \n6. \n\nLessons  \n\nBy  2005,  507  small  hydropower  stations  (i.e.,  capacity  less  than  10  MW)  with  total \n20. \ninstalled  capacity  of  about  100  MW  had  been  installed  in  Viet  Nam.  About  one  third  of  these \npower plants are not working, abandoned for various reasons. Most of the others are operating \nat  below  the  rated  capacity.  The  first  reason  for  this  situation  is  poor  maintenance,  a \nconsequence of lack of operator training, difficulties in retaining trained staff (partly due to low \nsalaries  and  better  employment  opportunities  in  the  big  cities),  lack  of  spares,  and  poor \ninventory  policy.  Second,  commissioning  procedures  have  often  been  poor;  in  many  cases \nequipment did not conform to specifications and manuals for operation and maintenance were \neither  not  provided  or  provided  in  languages  other  than  Vietnamese.  Third,  and  most \nimportantly, these problems have proven difficult to resolve because the entities responsible for \nplant operation lack financial capacity. Off-grid schemes that depend entirely (or mostly) on tariff \nrevenue \nfrom  poor  domestic  households  cannot  cover  operating  costs,  and  subsidy \ncommitments  from  the  Government  are  ad  hoc  and  often  late.  With  no  policy  framework  to \nfacilitate the connection of small plants to the grid, local authorities viewed the arrival of the grid \nas  removing  their  political  commitment  to  maintain  small  hydropower  plants.  However  no \ntechnical reason indicates why a well-functioning small hydro project cannot continue to operate \nand sell surplus power into the grid.  \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fThese lessons are incorporated to the project design, which is based on the concept of \n21. \ncombining  remote  area  electrification  with  the  development  of  mini-hydro  power  plants  of \nsufficient size that warrant grid connection, thereby providing a sustainable operating cash flow. \nThe participation of EVN\u2019s power companies as executing agencies ensures adequate technical \nexpertise  and  ongoing  support  for  operation  and  maintenance.  The  Project  will  also  set  up \nprovincial subsidiaries of executing agencies with the mandate to operate the mini-hydropower \nplants;  they  will  be  provided  with  capacity  building  on  preventive  maintenance  under  the \nassociated  technical  assistance.  To  combat  the  issue  of  equipment  not  complying  with \nprescribed specifications, the technical assistance consultants will assist the executing agencies \ncarry  out  a  thorough  evaluation  of  technical  bids,  and  inspections  during  manufacturing  and \nerection. \n \n\n7. \n\nADB Sector Experience Strategy \n\nADB  has  approved  four  ordinary  capital  resources  loans2 totaling  $1,676  million  and \n22. \nthree Asian Development Fund (ADF) loans3 amounting to $186.3 million for Viet Nam\u2019s power \nsector. The ADF loans were primarily for expansion and rehabilitation of distribution networks in \nurban  areas.  The  two  ordinary  capital  resources  loans  approved  in  2004  and  2005  finance \nexpansion  of  the  500  kV  high  voltage  transmission  systems  in  northern  Viet  Nam.  More \nrecently,  ADB  has  focused  on  power  generation.  For  example,  the  Mong  Duong  1  Thermal \nPower  Project  and  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower  Project  (footnote  1)  are  financing  power \ngeneration facilities using domestic coal and hydro resources in an environmentally sustainable \nmanner.  ADB  has  also  supported  private  sector  investment  in  power  generation  by  providing \ndirect loans and political risk guarantees for the Phu My 2.2 gas-fired power project in 2002 and \nthe Phu My 3 project in 2003.4  \n \nADB has assisted Viet Nam through a series of TA projects5 to facilitate policy reforms \n23. \nincluding the new Electricity Law and laid the framework for power sector restructuring. During \n2005  and  2006,  ADB  approved  a  series  of  advisory  TA  projects  to  improve  the  crosscutting \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2004.

The  competitiveness  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy,  especially \nthe  industry  sector,  depends  on  the  availability  of  a  cheap  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity. \nADB\u2019s  power  sector  strategy  aims  to  help  the  Government  meet  the  challenge  of  increasing \ndemand  for  electricity  in  a  financially,  environmentally,  and  socially  sustainable  manner.  The \nlarge  investment  requirement  of  the  power  sector  requires  concerted  efforts  from  both  public \nand  private  sector  investors.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  public  sector  investments  will  be \nfinanced  through  multilateral  or  bilateral  financing,  and  ADB  will  increasingly  leverage \ncofinancing from other financiers in the sector. ADB will also assist public sector entities in the \nsector to access international capital markets by providing advisory and risk-sharing instruments \nsuch as guarantee instruments. \n \n25. \nIn  the  context  of  the  Government\u2019s  strong  drive  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable \nenergy in total electricity generation and the low prevalence of renewable energy in Viet Nam\u2019s \ncurrent  electricity  generation  mix,  opportunities  for  financing  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency investments will be actively pursued. ADB will actively promote the adoption of clean \nand more efficient technologies for new power generating projects, particularly the application of \nsupercritical and ultra-supercritical technologies in coal-fired power plants, combined cycle gas \nturbines, and renewable technologies such as wind and small hydro. The Project will be ADB\u2019s \nfirst investment in the renewable energy subsector in Viet Nam.  \n \n\n8. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n26. \nThe focus of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet Nam is on supporting pro-poor \neconomic growth, social equity and balanced development, and sustainable management of the \nenvironment.  ADB  has  been  a  major  financier  of  energy  in  Viet  Nam,  financing  high  voltage \npower  transmission  and  large-scale  power  generation  projects  to  address  infrastructure \nbottlenecks inhibiting the economic growth of the country. The Project is aimed at equitable and \nbalanced  development  of  the  country  to  support  the  supply  of  electricity  to  mountainous  and \npoor  communities  that  have  lagged  the  rest  of  the  country  in  overall  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  ADB  is  also  committed  to  the  development  of  renewable  and  clean  energy \nsources to meet the rapidly growing demand for energy in a sustainable manner. The Project is \nconsistent with the sector development objectives of ADB\u2019s energy strategy for Viet Nam. \n \n27. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  addressing  several  barriers  to  the  development  of  renewable \nenergy  and  electrification  of  remote  communes.  It  will  provide  concessionary  financing  to \ndevelop renewable energy to provide affordable electricity to communities living in mountainous \nand remote poor communes. The grid-connected mini-hydro projects in the four provinces with \nthe least access to electricity in the country will use locally available hydro resources to supply \nelectricity to the communes in remote areas and provide excess electricity to the national grid. \nThe  cash  surplus  from sales to  the  national  grid  will  be  utilized  to  indirectly  subsidize  network \nexpansion into remote areas. The Project will support the expansion of medium and low voltage \nnetworks  in  communes  to  villages  without  access  to  electricity  by  providing  concessionary \nfinancing, as the financial returns to utility of rural electrification are not attractive.  \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  promotion  of  pro-poor  and  balanced  economic \n28. \ndevelopment  of  remote  mountainous  communes  and  poor  communes  through  the  sustainable \nuse of electricity and renewable energy in an affordable manner. The outcome of the Project will \nbe  provision  of  reliable  and  affordable  supply  of  electricity  to  remote  mountainous  and  poor \ncommunes.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n29.    The  Project  comprises  two  main  components  and  an  associated  TA  grant  for  capacity \nbuilding for renewable energy development in Viet Nam. The detailed description of subprojects \nis provided in Appendix 5, and the subproject selection criteria are provided in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n1. \n\nLoan Component 1: Mini-Hydro Development for Rural Electrification  \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  finance  the  development  of  about  5\u201310  mini-hydropower  plants,  each \nwith  a  capacity  of  less  than  7.5  MW  in  Lai  Chau,  Dien  Bien,  and  several  other  northern  and \ncentral provinces. The Project will also finance the connection of these mini-hydropower plants \nto the national grid and the expansion of the low voltage network to supply nearby un-electrified \nvillages.  This  component  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  over  30  MW  of  combined \ngeneration  capacity  to  the  national  power  system,  and  extend  the  medium  voltage  power \nnetwork  in  remote  areas  of  Viet  Nam  by  about  50\u2013100  kilometers  (km).  In  addition  to  the \ndevelopment of mini-hydropower plants, the Project will finance the electrification of villages that \nare  located  close  to  the  existing  medium  voltage  network.  Low  voltage  transformers  will  be \ninstalled  and  the  low  voltage  network  extended  by  about  75\u2212100  km.  An  additional  25\u201350 \nvillages  and  about  3,000\u20135,000  households  are  expected  to  be  provided  with  electricity. \nThrough the associated TA grant administered by ADB, the Project will strengthen the technical \nand administrative operation and maintenance capability of small hydropower plants of PC1 and \nPC3. \n \n\n2. \n\nLoan  Component  2:  Network  Expansion  and  Rehabilitation  for  Poor \nCommunes \n\nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  special  program  of  rural  electrification.  Under  this \n31. \nprogram,  the  state  budget  provides  financing  to  EVN\u2019s  Power  Company  2  (PC  2)  and  Power \nCompany 3 (PC 3) to finance 85% of the cost of rural electrification in five selected provinces in \nthe Central Highlands. The Government intends initially to  extend this program to include four \nadditional provinces (i.e., Soc Trang and Tra Vinh in the south, and Dien Bien and Lai Chau in \nthe north). Component 2 of the Project will finance the proposed government financing in these \nprovinces.  This  financing  will  cover  the  expansion  of  the  rural  distribution  network  to  connect \nvillages that do not have access to electricity and rehabilitation of the existing poorly constructed \nlow  voltage  networks  serving  remote  communes.  The  project  scope  includes  (i)  expansion  of \nthe medium voltage network by about 800\u20131,000 km, (ii) 2,000 to 2,500 km of medium to low \nvoltage  substations  totaling  35  to  40  megavolt-amperes  (MVA),  and  (iii)  2,500  to  3,000  km  of \nlow  voltage  distribution  lines  to  provide  electricity  to  about  100,000  households  in  more  than \n1,000 villages.  \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f32.  MOIT  will  submit  the  final  list  of  provinces  to  be  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  Special \nProgram for Rural Electrification to ADB before loan effectiveness. The Government will onlend \nany surplus funds over and above the funds allocated for the provinces included in the Special \nProgram,  to  the  respective  executing  agency  on  term  and  conditions  outlined  in  para.  38  to \nelectrify communes not included in the special program to be selected in accordance with the \nselection criteria in Appendix 6. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCost Recovery of Power Supply to Difficult Areas \n\n33. \nOne of the main issues for power utilities serving sparsely populated rural areas with low \nper capita consumption of electricity is the low financial viability of grid extensions. In Viet Nam, \noff-grid  technologies  such  as  micro  hydro  and  solar  power  have  poor  financial  rates  of  return, \nand  provide  unreliable  and  poor  quality  electricity  supply.  The  Project  is  designed  to  address \nthis  issue  by  sharing  the  cost  of  grid  expansion  with  mini-hydropower  plants  and  using  the \nrevenues  from  electricity  sales  of  these  plants  to  subsidize  expansion  of  the  grid  to \ncommunities. The proposed approach will use locally available hydro resources for the benefit \nof local communities, and provide surplus renewable energy to the national power network. The \neconomic  and  financial  analyses  of  a  core  subproject  under  component  1  are  summarized  in \nSupplementary  Appendixes  A  and  B.  The  detailed  economic  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n\n2. \n\nClean Development Mechanism \n\n34. \nThe Project involves several mini-hydropower plants in remote areas, which will result in \nreduced  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  as  well  as  replacement  of  energy  generated  at \nthermal  power  plants.  The  proposed  mini-hydropower  plants  are  run-of-river  type  and  will  not \nresult in methane emissions. They will reduce grid losses by being close to demand centers at \nthe end of relatively long and weak transmission systems. As overall capacity increases with the \ncompletion  of  several  large  hydropower  and  thermal  power  plants  towards  the  end  of  the \nproposed Project in 2014-15, prevailing system power shortages will be minimized by the time \nsub  projects  financed  under  the  proposed  project  are  commissioned.  The  small  hydropower \nplants  to  be  built  under  the  Project  are  therefore  expected  to  replace  the  thermal  power \ngeneration.  They  will  also  meet  the  additionality  criteria  of  the  CDM  executive  board  as  they \nface  investment  barriers  due  to  the  high  cost  of  construction  in  remote  areas  and  lower \neconomies of scale compared with large-scale hydropower plants. Assistance will be provided \nfor the preparation of project design documents for submission to the CDM executive board for \neach  province  included  in  component  1  (several  mini-hydropower  plants  will  be  located  in  a \ngiven province).  \n \n\n3. \n\nPro-Poor Geographic Targeting \n\n35. \nThe  Project  is  designed  with  a  special  focus  on  geographically  targeting  poor \ncommunities for electrification. Sites will be selected for development of mini-hydro and network \nexpansion  subprojects  by  stipulating  that  at  least  50%  of  households  receiving  electricity \nthrough  a  subproject  shall  have  income  level  below  the  national  poverty  rate.  The  medium \nvoltage  lines  for  connecting  the  mini-hydropower  plants  will  be  routed  to  maximize  the \nconnection  of  households  without  electricity.  For  poor  households  (i.e.,  those  with  a  monthly \nincome of less than D200,000 [$13] per capita as per the Government\u2019s definition of poverty), \nsubsidized grid connection will be provided to ensure they receive the benefits of electrification.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPromotion of Productive Use of Energy and Income Generation Activities \n\n36. \nElectrification  has  a  poverty  reduction  potential  only  if  poor  and  near-poor  households \ncan afford and have capacity to benefit. In very poor communities, most people do not have the \nnecessary economic or technical capacity to use electricity to improve their lives and livelihoods. \nThe  Project  will  promote  the  productive  use  of  electricity  through  the  associated  TA.  A \nnongovernmental organization will be contracted to implement this component to undertake the \nfollowing activities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nsupport poor households\u2019 access to microfinance credits for income generation; \nand \n\nprovide borrowers with TA and capacity building for utilizing the loans efficiently \nto improve their livelihoods. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\n37. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $197.6 million, including taxes and duties of \n$20  million.  The  summary  cost  estimates  are  shown  in  Table  1  and  detailed  project  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category,  executing  agency,  and  financing  source  is  shown  in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\na.

The loan \nwill have a 32-year maturity period including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n\n\f1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period.  The  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF) will onlend the component 1 proceeds to the executing agencies (i.e., Power Company 1 \n[PC 1] and PC 3) with a repayment period of 27 years including a grace period of 7 years and \ninterest  rate  of  2.5%  subject  to  Government  approval.  MOF  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds \nallocated  for  provinces  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  Special  Program  for  Rural  Electrification \nunder  component  2  to PC 1,  PC 2,  and  PC 3 on  grant  basis.  EVN  proposes  that  MOF  onlend \nthe funds allocated for component 2 for provinces not included in the Special Program for Rural \nElectrification  to  the  PC 1,  PC 2,  and  PC 3  with  a  repayment  period  of  27  years  including  a \ngrace period of 7 years and interest rate of 2.5%, subject to Government approval.  \n \n39. \nADB  financing  will  cover  100%  of  the  eligible  expenses  including  taxes  incurred  in \nprocuring equipment, materials, and civil works for implementing the Project; the taxes are not \nexcessive,  amounting  to  less  than  10%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  counterpart  funds  to  be \nprovided  by  the  executing  agencies  will  finance  resettlement  expenses,  bank  charges,  and \nproject  management  costs  including  the  services  of  national  consultants  required  for  project \npreparation and supervision.

For  component  2,  PC 1,  PC 2,  and  PC 3  will  be  the \nexecuting  agencies  in  their  respective  geographic  areas.  MOIT  will  assign  the  Rural \nElectrification  and  Renewable  Energy  Project  Management  Board  (REREPMB),  currently \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  the  ongoing  World  Bank  Rural  Energy  Project,  overall \ncoordination of project implementation. MOIT will set up a steering committee chaired by  a vice \nminister  comprising  representatives  EVN,  PC 1,  PC 2,  and  PC 3  to  monitor  and  provide \nguidance  and  direction  to  project  implementation.  The  provincial  people's  committees  of  the \nrespective projects will be asked to give a no objection to sub-project proposals. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fThe  power  companies  will  entrust  project  implementation  in  each  region  to  the  project \n41. \nmanagement boards (PMBs), staffed with full-time personnel. PC 1 and PC 3 will each recruit \nnational  consulting  firms  financed  through  counterpart  funds  to  prepare  feasibility  studies  for \nselected  subprojects.  The  international  consultants  will  provide  capacity  building  to  PMBs  to \nreview  selection  of  subprojects,  the  feasibility  studies,  technical  design,  and  bid  documents \nprepared  by  the  executing  agencies\u2019  national  consultants  for  component  1  of  the  Project.  The \nsubprojects  to  be  included  in  component  1  should  satisfy  the  subproject  selection  criteria  in \nAppendix  6.  PC 1  and  PC 3  will  submit  the  feasibility  study  including  the  (i)  technical \nassessment,  (ii) financial  and  economic  analyses,  and  (iii)  necessary  safeguard  documents \nsuch  as  initial  environmental  assessment  to  ADB  for  approval  before  preparing  the  bidding \ndocuments. PC 1 and PC 3 will approve the technical design of each subproject. PC 1 and PC 3 \nwill  also  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  the  resettlement  plan  for  each  subproject  under \ncomponent 1 before the award of each civil works contract.  \n \n42. \nEach  executing  agency  will  implement  component  2  through  their  provincial  units  and \nthe  PMB  of  each  executing  agency.  The  selection  of  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  in  close \ncollaboration with the PPCs in accordance with the selection criteria outlined in Appendix 6. The \npower companies will submit a simple subproject selection report to MOIT and ADB for approval \nfor each province to be included in the Project. Upon approval of the subproject selection, the \npower companies will entrust implementation of subprojects in each province to their provincial \nunits, and the PMB of each power company will be responsible for supervising implementation \nand  reporting  progress  to  MOIT.  Each  power  company  will  recruit  national  consulting  firms \nfinanced  through  counterpart  funds  to  prepare  feasibility  studies  for  selected  subprojects;  the \ninternational consultants (para. 41) will monitor progress. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n43. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  from  June  2009  to  December  2015.  The  detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. The identification and selection of subprojects to be \nincluded  in  component 1  will  be  completed  in  2009.  The  feasibility  studies,  including  the \nhydrological measurements, will be undertaken in 2010 and the technical designs and bidding \ndocuments  will  be  completed  by  June  2011.  The  civil  work  contracts  and  equipment  supply \ncontracts  are  expected  to  be  awarded  for  component 1  by  December  2011,  and  project \nconstruction will be carried out during 2012\u20132014; commissioning will be variable depending on \nthe subproject, but would start mid-2014.  \n \nPC 2  can  commence  the  procurement  of  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts  for \n44. \ncomponent  2,  immediately  for  Soc Trang  and Tra  Vinh  provinces  as  the  feasibility  studies  are \nalready approved. The civil works under component 2 for Soc Trang and Tra Vinh provinces will \ncommence  in  the  third  quarter  of  2010  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2012.  The  feasibility \nstudies and bidding documents for component 2, to be implemented by PC 1 and PC 3, will be \nprepared  during  June  2009\u2013December  2010,  and  procurement  will  be  undertaken  during  the \nfirst  half  of  2011.  The  civil  works  and  installations  of  the  rural  electricity  network  in  PC  1  and \nPC 3 areas will be undertaken from October 2011 to December 2013. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n45. \nProcurement  of  works,  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  electromechanical \nequipment  for  the  mini-hydropower  plants,  and  equipment  and  materials  for  medium  and  low \nvoltage  distribution  lines  and  substations  will  be  procured  in  several  packages  using \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\finternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  civil  work  contracts  for  construction  of  the \nmini-hydropower  plants  and  installation  of  medium  and  low  voltage  distribution  lines  will  be \nawarded  using  international  competitive  bidding  or  national  competitive  bidding  procedures \n(NCB) acceptable to ADB and will be subject to selective post review. The NCB procedures will \nbe  applied  for  work  contracts  below  $2  million  and  equipment  contracts  below  $500,000; \nshopping will be allowed for procurement of goods and services with a contract price less than \n$100,000. The NCB procedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, as \nwell as its NCB Annex applicable to Viet Nam (Supplementary Appendix D). The procurement \nplan  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  9  and  shows  details  of  the  immediate  procurement  for  the \nnext 18 months, and estimates for the Project overall. As the list of sub-projects to be financed \nunder  the  sector  Project  is  finalized  in  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation,  the \nprocurement plan will be updated to include that information. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nThe  executing  agencies  will  recruit  consultants  financed  by  them  (Appendix  7)  to \nprepare  feasibility  studies,  detail  design  documents,  and  bidding  documents;  and  supervise \nconstruction. These consultants will be recruited and engaged in 2009 according to Vietnamese \nguidelines.  Consulting  services  required  for  technical  and  safeguard  support  for  subproject \npreparation and capacity building will be provided through the associated TA grant administered \nby  ADB.  These  consulting  services  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all \ncontractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project. \nEVN has handled several ADB projects, and is familiar with ADB procedures and anticorruption \nmeasures.  These  projects  helped establish  clear  procedures  and  practices  for  procurement  of \nequipment and civil works. There have not been any major audit issues or suspicion of fraud. As \na  parent  company,  EVN  is  expected  to  oversee  PCs  on  these  measures  adequately \nimplemented;  Governance  risks  will  be  further  minimized  by  providing  detailed  Project \ninformation on a project website, using detailed procurement plans, regular project reviews, and \nproviding information and training for EAs' staff not familiar with ADB\u2019s policy and procedures. \nSpot-checking will also be done to check adherence to the Policy. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nDisbursements  will  be  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the  Government, \nexecuting  agencies,  and  ADB.  The  disbursements  for  civil  works,  goods,  and  equipment \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  will  be  made  by  direct  payment  and \ncommitment procedures. Each executing agency will set up one imprest account soon after loan \neffectiveness at banks acceptable to ADB. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\freplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government,  executing  agencies,  and  ADB.  The \nmaximum amount to be maintained in each imprest account will not exceed 10% of the grant or \nloan  funds  made  available  to  each  power  company  from  the  ADB  loan,  or  6  months  of \nexpenditures to be funded through their respective imprest accounts, whichever is less.  \n \n49.    The statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditure \nand liquidate advances to the executing agencies; records will be maintained to substantiate the \npayments made through statement of expenditures. Payments under statement of expenditures \nwill  be  limited  to  $100,000  per  payment.  The  executing  agencies  will  prepare  withdrawal \napplications and submit them to MOF for endorsement. Disbursement arrangements are shown \nin  a  flow  chart  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  executing  agencies  financial  management \ncapacity is deemed adequate since PC 2 and PC 3 have previously received ADB funding, and \nall \nrural \nelectrification projects. \n \n\nthree  executing  agencies  are  presently \n\nimplementing  World  Bank-financed \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nEach  executing  agency  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  that  identify  the  goods  and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, resources received, expenditures incurred, including \nthe use of counterpart funds for implementing the subprojects included in the Project. Separate \naccounts  for  subprojects  will  be  established  and  maintained  at  each  executing  agency  in \naccordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. Auditors acceptable to ADB will \naudit  annual  project  accounts  maintained  at  executing  agencies  for  activities  undertaken  in \nrelation  to  the  Project.  Audit  coverage  will  include  separate  opinions  on  (i)  utilization  of  the \nimprest accounts; (ii) statement of expenditures, including whether the amount claimed is duly \nsupported  and  verified;  and  (iii)  whether  the  executing  agencies  are  operating  the  imprest \naccounts  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures.  The  audit  reports,  management  letter,  and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date, if earlier. The financial performance \nand  financial  management  analysis  of  the  executing  agencies  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nProject  progress  and  performance  will  be  monitored  by  a  steering  committee  to  be  set \nup  by  MOIT,  comprising  representatives  of  each  of  the  executing  agencies  and  EVN.  The \ncommittee  will  use  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Each  executing \nagency  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  REREPMB.  These  reports  will  record  (i) \nprogress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps taken or proposed \nto remedy the problems, (iv) proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected for the \nfollowing quarter. REREPMB and MOIT will ensure that these reports are submitted to ADB in a \ntimely  manner.  Within  6  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  executing  agencies \nwill  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  describing  (i)  physical  progress  of  the  Project, \n(ii) actual  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  cost  estimates,  (iii)  results  of  capacity-building  activities, \n(iv)  outcome  of  safeguard  efforts,  (v) preliminary  assessment  of  achieved  benefits,  and  (vi) \nother relevant project implementation matters requested by ADB.  \n \n52.    Project  benefit  monitoring  activities  will  entail  periodic  monitoring  of  the  benefits  and \nimpacts  of  electrification  in  a  representative  number  of  selected  subprojects.  Socioeconomic \nbaseline  data  for  a  sample  set  of communes  will  be  established  at  the commencement  of  the \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fProject. The set of communes will include communes selected for inclusion in the Project and \nsimilar  communes  not  included  in  the  Project  for  electrification.  The  socioeconomic  status  of \nthese  communes  will  be  monitored  after  project  completion  to  assess  the  impact  of \nelectrification  on  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the  communes.  This  will  be  undertaken \nindependently  as  part  of  the  project  completion  report  to  be  prepared  by  executing  agencies \nusing a framework consistent with the Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nApart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  comprehensive \nreview within 18 months of loan effectiveness when the first batch of subprojects will be in the \nconstruction stage. A midterm review will be undertaken within 36 months of loan effectiveness. \nimplementation \nThese  reviews  will \narrangements; (ii) detailed evaluation of the scope and implementation process, and progress of \nsubprojects; and (iii) possible reallocation of loan proceeds. Remedial action will be instituted as \nrequired. \n \n\ninclude  (i)  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  project \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n54. \nA  $2.9  million  advisory  TA  project  will  be  provided  with  the  sector  loan  for  Capacity \nBuilding  of  Renewable  Energy  Development.  The  TA  will  be  financed  through  the  Climate \nChange Fund ($1.6 million) and Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV, $0.9 million). The \nGovernment  will  provide  $29,000  in  kind  and  the  power  companies  $371,000  also  in  kind \n(Appendix 10). ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, and PC1, PC 2, PC 3 and MOIT \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  TA  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The disbursements will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.6 The TA is expected \nto  commence  in  August  2009  and  finish  in  December  2015.  The  TA  comprises  the  following \ncomponents (a detailed description of the TA is provided in Supplementary Appendix G and a \nsummary in Appendix 10). \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDevelop  a  policy  framework  for  renewable  energy  development  in  Viet  Nam  by \nsupporting  the  Government  in  developing  a  new  renewable  energy  law  and \nimplementing  decrees  and  guidelines.  The  consultants  will  propose  specific \nincentives  to  be  included  in  the  law  to  facilitate  renewable  energy  technologies \nsuch  as  wind.  One  international  and  one  national  individual  consultant  will \nundertake  this  with  4  person-months  of  international  consultant  input  and  8 \nperson-months  of  national  consultant  input.  MOIT  will  be  the  implementing \nagency for this component of the TA. \nCapacity  building  in  sustainable  small  hydropower  plant  planning  (including \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies,  technical  designs,  and  ADB-compliant  bidding \nand  safeguard  documents); \nthe  power \nimplementation  and  operation  of \ncompanies  and \nit  provincial  subsidiaries;  and  operation  and  preventive \nmaintenance  of  small  hydropower  plants.  The  TA  consultants  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  preparing  the  CDM  project  design  documents.  The  consultants \nwill  also  undertake  capacity  building  on  preparing  ethnic  minority  development \nplans  for  rural  electrification  projects  at  provincial  level.  An  international  firm  of \nconsultants  will  undertake  this  work  with  56  person-months  of  international \nconsultants  input  and  54  person-months  of  national  consultant  input.

PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3 will be the implementing \nagencies for this component. \nAssist  people  receiving  electricity  under  the  Project  to  develop  income-\ngenerating activities using electricity and help in accessing microfinance for such \nactivities.  A  nongovernmental  organization  will  undertake  this  with  70  person-\nmonths  of  staff  input.  The  bio-data  technical  proposal  format  using  the  fixed-\nbudget selection method will be used to select the NGO. PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3 \nwill be the implementing agencies for this component. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  achievement  of  pro-poor  and  balanced \n55. \neconomic development of remote and isolated communes in Viet Nam through the sustainable \nuse  of  energy,  and  in  particular,  renewable  energy.  To  achieve  this  impact,  the  Project  will \nprovide  a  reliable  and  affordable  supply  of  electricity  to  remote  communes  through  mini-\nhydropower plants and grid expansion. The Project will promote productive use of electricity for \nincome-generating  activities.  It  is  also  expected  to  result  in  global  environmental  benefits  by \nreducing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  replacing  some  of  the  fossil  fuel-based \npower generation capacity with run-of-river mini-hydropower plants. However, the realization of \nthese  overall  objectives  is  subject  to  certain  risk  factors  associated  with  technical,  policy, \ninstitutional, social, financial, economic, and environmental aspects.  \n \nA. \n\nAssumptions and Risk Factors \n\n1. \n\nTechnical \n\n56. \nAs  the  subprojects  under  the  Project  comprise  mini-hydropower  plants  and  grid \nexpansion of medium voltage and low voltage networks, no major technical risks are associated \nwith  project  implementation  given  Viet  Nam\u2019s  long  history  of  constructing  mini-hydropower \nplants. However, hydrological records of small tributaries where the proposed mini-hydropower \nplants  are  located  may  not  be  available.  The  hydrological  measurements  will  be  taken  for  12 \nmonths  and  then  correlated  with  long-term  rainfall  records  and  flow  records  of  neighbouring \nriver  basins  to  estimate  the  hydrology  and  economic  viability  of  the  subprojects  during  the \ndetailed feasibility studies to be undertaken during project implementation. PC 1 and PC 3 are \nresponsible for implementing this component, and have expertise in constructing and operating \npower  distribution  lines  and  in  operating  small  hydropower  plants  (i.e.,  less  than  60  MW). \nHowever, the mini-hydropower projects are exposed to hydrological risk in the context of climate \nchange  and  the  possibility  of  extreme  climate  events,  such  as  flash  floods,  storms,  and \nlandslides  in  remote  mountainous  areas.  The  associated  TA  grant  will  ensure  that  the  mini-\nhydropower  projects  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  designed  using  state-of-the-art  low \nmaintenance  technologies;  training  on  preventive  maintenance  will  be  provided  to  the \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy and Institutional  \n\n57. \nViet Nam\u2019s policy framework for renewable energy development is evolving. The recent \ndecision  by  the  Government  to  provide  a  standard  power  purchase  agreement  based  on  an \navoided  cost  tariff  principle  has  encouraged  many  private  sector  investors  to  enter  the  sector. \nHowever,  these  private  sector  investors  have  no  incentive  to  route  the  medium  voltage  lines \nconnecting the mini-hydropower projects so that they benefit local communities without access \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto electricity. The Project assumes the public sector executing agencies (i.e., PC 1 and PC 3) \nwill address this issue due to their obligation, as a public utility, to electrify rural areas. Provincial \nsubsidiaries are proposed to take over the operation of mini-hydropower plants in each province \nwith  PC  1  and  PC  3  retaining  a  majority  stake.  This  will  improve  the  financial  viability  of \nelectricity supply to remote areas as the provincial units of power companies are receiving some \nof their electricity from the embedded mini-hydropower plants. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironment and Resettlement \n\n58. \nGiven  the  nature  and  magnitude  of  the  proposed  mini-hydropower  projects  to  be \nincluded in component 1, adverse environmental impacts are not expected to be significant and \nmitigation measures will be implemented to minimize negative impacts. Construction of the mini-\nhydropower plants and grid expansion will entail vegetation loss. However, adverse impacts on \nbiodiversity  are  expected  to  be  minor  since  the  area  to  be  cleared  for  each  subproject  is \nrelatively  small.  Further,  the  subprojects  will  not  be  located  in  ecologically  protected  areas. \nOther  potential  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  of  mini-hydropower  plants  include \nsiltation due to surface run-off, erosion of exposed areas, and increased noise due to site works \nand  equipment  operation.  Operation  impacts  may  include  changes  in  the  stream  hydrological \nregime  that  could  influence  the  aquatic  ecosystems  in  terms  of  water  quality  and  population \nstructure of aquatic organisms. The Project will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions due to \nreplacement  of  expensive  thermal  power  generation  with  a  renewable  and  clean  source  of \nenergy  through  run-of-river  mini-hydro  plants.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  was  prepared  to  guide the  preparation  of  component  1  subprojects  Supplementary \nAppendix  H.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  a  core  subproject  under \ncomponent 1 is summarized in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n59. \nA  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  core  subproject,  Nam  Nghe  mini-\nhydropower.  Nine  households  will  be  affected  due  to  permanent  impacts  on  their  agricultural \nland. No stream uses or fishing activities occur on the proposed reservoir and downstream area, \ntherefore,  the  subproject  will  not  affect  any  livelihood  or  socioeconomic  activities  of  local \nresidents. The resettlement impacts of the remaining component 1 subprojects are not expected \nto  be  significant  as  only  subprojects  with  involuntary  resettlement  categorization  B  will  be \nincluded  in  the  Project.  A  short  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement framework  for these subprojects. A summary resettlement plan and framework is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix J. The resettlement framework and resettlement plan are \nshown in Supplementary Appendixes K and L, respectively.  \n \n\n4. \n\nEthnic Minorities  \n\n60. \nEthnic minorities are the major beneficiaries in the northern mountain project provinces \nof  Dien  Bien  and  Lai  Chau  where  subprojects  under  component  1  are  likely  to  be  located.  In \nMuong Te District, Lai Chau province, where the core subproject is located, poverty is high with \n61%  of  households  and  almost  97%  of  the  total  population  living  in  poverty.  The  population \ncomprises 14 ethnic minority groups. In Dien Bien province, five ethnic minority groups make up \nmore  than  98%  of  the  population.  For  preparation  of  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan \n(EMDP)  for  all  subprojects  under  component  1,  an  ethnic  minority  development  framework \n(EMDF)  was  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  M,  a  summary  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix N).  The  EMDF  will  ensure  that  culturally  appropriate  implementation  of  the  Project \nand  social  and  economic  benefits  of  electrification  accrue  to  ethnic  minorities  and  potentially \nadverse impacts are avoided. An EMDP was prepared for a selected subproject in component 1 \nof the Project in accordance with the EMDF (Supplementary Appendix O). The EMDF supports \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\npromoting  productive  use  of  electricity  and  will  focus  on  providing  poor  households  with  extra \nsupport to improve their livelihoods through new opportunities with electrification. \n \n61. \nAlthough  communes  and  villages  with  ethnic  minorities  are  likely  to  be  included  in \ncomponent 2 of the Project, the impacts on indigenous people due to provision of electricity are \nnot significant.7 However, ethnic minority development plans will be prepared for each province \ntaking part in component 2 to ensure that project benefits accrue to the ethnic minorities. This \nincludes  the  selection  of  poor  communes  and  villages  to  be  included  in  the  Project,  and \nprovision of subsidized electricity connections to poor households.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPoverty \n\nLack  of  electricity  is  one  of  the  contributing  factors  to  poverty  and  poor  services  along \n62. \nwith  isolated  location,  poor  road  and  market  access,  and  low  education  in  the  mountainous \nareas  included  in  the  Project.  Income  generation  is  based  on  low-production,  small-scale \nagriculture based on manual labor due to lack of electricity, poor economic conditions, and low \neducation. Electricity will enable some improvements in agriculture, animal breeding, and food \nprocessing.  Although,  electricity  is  a  crucial  prerequisite  for  economic  and  social  development \nand poverty reduction in rural areas, electrification has a poverty reduction potential only if poor \nand  near-poor  households  can  afford  and  have  the  capacity  to  benefit  from  it.  In  very  poor \ncommunities, most people do not have the necessary economic or technical capacity to make \nuse of electricity to improve their lives and livelihoods. \n \n63. \nRural  electrification  contributes  to  household  income  by  improving  production  and \nbusiness  opportunities  (lighting,  electrical  appliances  and  machines  like  refrigerators,  water \npumps, and agricultural machines). The economic  benefit potential is especially high for small \nbusinesses, which currently depend on expensive diesel generation. Electricity also contributes \nto better conditions for improving health care, education, and social life; and contributes to more \nevening  time  that  can  be  used  for  studying  (by  school  children  and  adults  attending  training \nactivities),  income  generation  activities  such  as  making  handicrafts,  and  social  activities  and \nentertainment.  \n \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  communes  considered  too  remote  to  be  connected  to  the \n64. \nnational  grid,  but  have  potential  for  electrification  using  renewable  energy  sources  in  the \nnorthern  mountainous  areas  through  mini-hydropower  development.  The  Project  will  also \nprovide  electricity  connections  to  poor  communes  in  northern,  central  and  southern  Viet  Nam \nthrough grid expansion. The Project aims at equitable and balanced development in its focus on \nremote  and  poor  communes  that  are  lagging  the  rest  of  the  country  in  overall  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and have a relatively higher household poverty rate. The main beneficiaries of the \nProject are residents of communes in the project area that do not have access to electricity. The \nProject  will  provide  subsidized  electricity  connections  to  poor  households,  subsidized  energy \nefficiency bulbs for the households, and an awareness and motivational campaign for safe and \nproductive  use  of  electricity;  and  facilitate  access  to  microfinance  from  the  Social  Policy  Bank \nfor poor households of mountainous communes for income-generating activities.  \n \n65. \nDuring  project  preparation,  poverty  and  social  analyses  were  completed  for  one  of  the \nsubprojects  (i.e.,  core  subproject  in  northern  Viet  Nam)  under  component  1  and  for  several \ncommunes to be included in component 2, in two provinces in central and southern Viet Nam. \nThe  findings  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  ensure  that  the  poor  are  capable  of \n\n                                                 \n7   As per definition provided in ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section F3: Indigenous Peoples. Manila (para. 5). \n\n\fbenefiting from electrification. A comprehensive consultation and participation strategy prepared \nfor the Project is included as the Supplementary Appendix  P. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy for the Project is provided in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n6. \n\nGender Strategy \n\n \n66. \nEthnic minority women in the mountainous region live in remote locations, and have very \nlimited contact and information outside their own communities. Women play a significant role in \nagriculture, livestock rearing, and collection of forest products. Lack of electricity increases their \nworkload. Access to electricity can improve agriculture productivity, and enhance opportunities \nfor income-generating activities for women. Electricity in public places will increase security for \nwomen and enable their participation in evening social gatherings. Electricity will improve health \nservices,  especially  maternal  health  facilities,  in  the  communes.  Overall,  women\u2019s  living \nconditions,  work,  and  income  generation  can  be  improved  through  electrification,  both  directly \nand  through  cumulative  impacts,  but  gains  will  depend  on  their  ability  to  afford  improvements \n(e.g., household electric appliances and production machines). A gender strategy prepared for \nthe  overall  Project  focuses  on  activities  to  ensure  women  benefit  from  electrification  and  the \nprevention  of  harmful  impacts  during  construction,  particularly  in  poor  and  vulnerable \ncommunes  to  be  included  in  the  two  project  components.  Details  of  the  social  assessment, \nincluding a gender strategy (Supplementary Appendix Q), are included in the summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy (Appendix 11). \n \nB. \n\nOverall Assessment of the Sector Project \n\nThe selection criteria of subprojects to be included in component 1 are to ensure that the \n67. \nmini-hydro  projects  have  a  financial  rate  of  return  that  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital.  The  economic  rate  of  return  will  exceed  the  threshold  of  12%,  as  economic  benefits \nvalued  at  avoided  economic  cost  of  power  generation  exceed  the  financial  benefits  valued  at \navoided financial cost. The attached TA will minimize the technical risk factors by building on the \nexperience  of  the  executing  agencies.  Component  2  does  not  pose  any  technical  or \nimplementation  risk  factors.  The  overall  selection  criteria  of  the  subprojects  for  component  2 \nensure that they meet a minimum economic return, while focusing on poor and remote parts of \nthe  country  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  takes  specific  measures  to  ensure  the \nbenefits  of  electrification  reach  the  poor  and  vulnerable  segments  of  the  society.  Hence,  the \noverall benefits of the Projects are in excess of the risk factors.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  executing  agencies  have \n\n68. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n69. \nThe subprojects under components 1 and 2 will be screened and selected in accordance \nwith  the  criteria  and  procedures  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  with  strong \nsupport by the benefiting communities, as outlined in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n2. \n\nPolicy Issues \n\n70. \nBy  the  end  of  the  project  period,  the  Government  will  take  necessary  administrative \nand/or  regulatory  measures  (i)  to  establish  simplified  procedures  for  approval,  licensing,  and \nconnecting  of  embedded  renewable  generation  projects  connected  to  the  medium  voltage \nnetwork  having  a  capacity  less  than  30  MW,  and  (ii)  to  establish  a  transparent  subsidy \nmechanism to promote renewable energy development and support electrification of remote and \ndifficult areas.  \n \n3. \n\nFinancial Issues \n\n71. \nThe  Government  will  ensure,  through  appropriate  tariff  adjustments  and  other  means, \nthat EVN, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3 maintain (i) a self-financing ratio of 25% or above, (ii) a debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.5  or  above,  and  (iii)  a  long-term  debt-equity  ratio  of  70:30  or  less. \nThe  Government  will  also  ensure  that  adequate  tariff  increases  are  proposed  by  EVN  and \nprocessed by the relevant authorities of the Government in a timely and effective manner. \n\n \n4. \n\nResettlement and Environmental Issues \n\n72. \nThe Government and executing agencies will ensure that only subprojects that fall within \ncategory C (no impacts) or category B (no significant impacts) on involuntary resettlement and \nthe  environment  will  be  permitted  under  the  Project.  The  screening  and  categorization  of  the \nsubprojects  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement  framework  and \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework.  In  the  event  that  any  resettlement  impacts \nare unavoidable for a particular subproject, the Government will prepare a resettlement plan for \nsuch  subproject  following  the  detailed  design  and  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement \nframework and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  project  activities  comply  with  (i)  applicable  laws  and \n73. \nregulations  of  Viet  Nam;  (ii)  ADB  environment  policies  and  regulations,  specifically  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002);  (iii)  agreed  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework;  and \n(iv) environmental mitigation measures and environmental monitoring plan as set out in the IEE \nto  be  approved  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  preparation  of  IEEs  for  noncore \nenvironment category B subprojects consistent with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.    \n \n74. \nThe Government will ensure that resettlement plan and IEE will be publicly disclosed in \nplaces accessible to all affected people prior to submission to ADB for its review and approval, \nall  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005).  Approval  by  ADB  of  the \nresettlement plan and IEE for each category B subproject will be a precondition to the award of \ncontracts for civil works.  \n \n75. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  are  not  issued  a  notice  of \npossession  of  site  for  construction  work  for  any  involuntary  resettlement  under  a  category  B \nsubproject  until  the  executing  agencies  have  satisfactorily  completed,  in  accordance  with  the \napproved  resettlement  plan,  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and  have \nensured that rehabilitation measures are in place and the area required for civil works is free of \nall encumbrances.  \n \n\n \n\n\f5. \n\nPoverty \n\n76. \nThe Government will ensure the project benefits accrue to the poorer segments of ethnic \nminorities  living  in  the  target  provinces.  The  Government  will  ensure  poor  households 8  in \nprovinces under the special program are provided with subsidized electricity connections fee at \n$40 or half the cost of connection, whichever is lower. The executing agencies will provide the \nhouse  wiring  for  electric  bulbs  and  sockets  as  part  of  connection.  The  Government  will  take \nappropriate  measures  that  the  poor  households  will  be  consulted  for,  and  participate  in,  the \nProject during subproject implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nEthnic Minority Development \n\nThe  executing  agencies  will  undertake  social  analysis  for  all  the  subprojects  to  be \n77. \nincluded  in  component  1  and  for  a  sample  of  communes  of  each  province  to  be  included  in \ncomponent  2  of  the  Project.  Based  on  the  social  analysis,  the  Government  will  ensure  that \nEMDPs  are  prepared  for  all  subprojects  under  component  1  and  provincial  EMDPs  for  each \nprovince included in component 2 that have significant impacts on ethnic minorities as per the \nEMDF.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  EMDPs  are  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  EMDPs  will  be  disclosed  to  the  affected \nethnic minorities prior to such submission and provide ADB with sufficient information so that it \ncan be posted on the ADB website. The poor ethnic minority households will also be provided \nwith subsidized electricity connections (para. 78).  \n\n \n7. \n\nGender \n\n78. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  gender  strategy  provided  in  the  EMDP  and \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  to  maximize  project  benefits  to  women  is \nimplemented. It will include the following specific actions: (i) hold separate meetings for planning \nproductive use of the electricity component with representatives from  the Women\u2019s Union and \nwomen  community  leaders  on  community  management  boards,  (ii)  provide  capacity  building \ntraining  to  women  on  productive  use  of  electricity  and  awareness  raising  campaign  on  safe \nelectricity, (iii) provide ethnic minority households headed by women with subsidized electricity \nconnections (para. 78), and (iv) register the replacement land in the names of both the husband \nand wife in cases where land acquisition has taken place. \n\n \n8. \n\nOther Social Matters  \n\n79. \nThe Government will cause PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3 to (i) cause contractors to comply with \nall  applicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  treaty  obligations,  and  to  not  employ  child \nlabor; (ii) cause contractors to provide safe working conditions for male and female workers; and \n(iii) carry out, in the campsites and the subproject villages, education and awareness campaigns \nfor  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  of  women  and  children,  in  coordination  with  the  agencies \nworking on the national program of HIV/AIDS prevention. \n\n9. \n\nOperation and Maintenance of Project Facilities \n\nThe Government will ensure that each PC will carry out the annual budget allocation that \n\n80. \nfully covers costs for the operation and maintenance of any Project facilities. \n\n                                                 \n8   The poor are defined as having an income below the national poverty line (D200,000 per person per month as of \n\n2008 poverty line).  \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n. \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n81. \nThe Government will sign separate subsidiary loan agreements, relating to the onlending \nof funds allocated for component 1, with PC 1 and PC 3 in substance and form satisfactory to \nADB.  \n \nC. \n\nConditions for Disbursement of Funds for Component 2 \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  Special  Program \n\nNo  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  portion  of  the  loan  to  support  a  particular \n82. \nprovince  under \nthe \nGovernment  issues  a  decision stipulating  such  province  is  included  in  the  special  program  for \nrural electrification.  \n \n83. \nNo  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  portion  of  the  loan  to  support  a  particular \nprovince  not  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  Special  Program  for  Rural  Electrification  until \nsubsidiary loan agreements relating to the onlending of funds are signed in substance and form \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nfor  Rural  Electrification,  until \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n84. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 102,161,000 \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Renewable  Energy  Development \nand  Network  Expansion  and  Rehabilitation  for  Remote  Communes  Sector \nProject, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;

MOIT  is  responsible  for  supervising  implementation  of  government  policy,  and \nrecommending  and  drafting  major  policy  reforms  for  government  adoption.  MOIT  has  specific \nresponsibility to implement the Government\u2019s policy of full electrification by 2020 and promoting \nrenewable energy generation.  \n\n2. \nViet Nam Electricity (EVN), the main power utility of Viet Nam, is organized as a holding \ncompany,  with  a  series  of  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  EVN  owns  the  strategic  power  plants, \nholds majority shareholding stakes in partially privatized power plants, and invests as the sole \ninvestor  or  in  partnership  with  other  public  and  private  investors  in  new  power  plants.  Key \nsubsidiaries  include  three  regional power  companies  that  are  in  charge  of  power  transmission \nand  distribution  from  110  kilovolts  (kV)  and  less  in  northern  Viet  Nam  (Power  Company 1  \n[PC 1]), southern Viet Nam (Power Company 2 [PC 2]), and central Viet Nam (Power Company \n3  [PC  3]);  and  power  distribution  companies  responsible  for  power  distribution  in  large  cities \nsuch  as  Hanoi,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hai  Phong,  and  Dong  Nai.  The  power  companies  each \nmaintain  their  own  financial  accounts  and  have  a  high  degree  of  managerial  and  financial \nautonomy. Other key entities under EVN include the Power Transmission Company responsible \nfor  high  voltage  (500  kV  and  220  kV)  power  transmission;  four  power  engineering  consulting \ncompanies; the National Load Dispatch Center; and subsidiaries engaged in noncore activities \nsuch as equipment manufacturing, telecommunications, real estate, and financial services.  \n\n3. \nViet Nam's far-reaching power sector reform program was launched with passage of the \nforward-looking Electricity Law in late 2004 and establishment of the new Electricity Regulatory \nAuthority  of  Viet  Nam  under  the  oversight  of  the  Minister  of  Industry.  The  country's  efforts  to \nrestructure  the  power  industry  and  develop  a  competitive  power  market  are  a  long-term \nproposition.  The  objectives  of  Viet  Nam's  power  sector  reform  are  to  maximize  efficiency \nthrough  competition  in  the  power  industry  and  to  expand  mobilization  of  investment  and \nmanagerial resources from outside the current state-operated system, in order to minimize costs \nand provide reliable, high-quality service to consumers. As described in the recently approved \nroad  map,  the  reform  process  is  expected  to  span  20  years,  and  proceed  through  \n(i) a preparatory phase and initial \"trial\" market, followed by operation of a competitive market \nfor  supply  from  generators  to  a  single  buyer;  (ii)  a  second  phase  introducing  a  wholesale \ncompetitive  market  for  bulk  supply  to  distribution  companies  and  large  users;  and  (iii)  a  final \nphase introducing retail competition. \n\nIn rural areas, local communities own and operate the low-voltage electricity distribution \n4. \nsystems  in  most  areas.  The  basic  approach  adopted  for  rural  electrification  in  Viet  Nam  has \nbeen  for  EVN's  power  companies  to  develop  the  medium-voltage  network,  and  for  local \ncommunities  to  develop  the  low-voltage  system  (although  EVN  has  undertaken  this  role  for \nabout  one  fifth  of  Viet  Nam's  communes).  Provincial  people\u2019s  committees  have  oversight  for \nrural  electrification  in  their  provinces,  and  provide  substantial  financial  support  for  the  local \nshare  of  investment.  Until  2004,  local  power  distribution  was  handled  by  informal  commune \nelectricity  groups  or  other  informal  entities  in  about  two  thirds  of  Viet  Nam's  electrified \ncommunes.  According  to  Government  regulations,  however,  all  of  these  entities  are  now \nrequired to convert to formal legal entities, such as cooperatives or joint-stock companies. As of \nthe  end  of  2007,  39%  of  electrified  communes  were  supplied  by  EVN\u2019s  power  distribution \n\n \n\n\f \n\n26 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nsubsidiaries,  54%  of  the  communes  by  cooperatives,  4%  of  the  communes  by  joint-stock \ncompanies, and only 3% by informal entities.  \n\nB. \n\nPower Sector Performance \n\n5. \nPerformance of Viet Nam's power industry, managed primarily by EVN, has been quite \ngood  during  recent  years.  The  industry  kept  pace  during  the  last  decade  with  extraordinary \nincreases  in  demand,  maintaining  basic  service  for  its  customers  most  of  the  time.  EVN  has \nmaintained strong financial viability, while keeping costs to consumers quite low by international \nstandards.  Dramatic  increases  in  rural  access  and  steady  reductions  in  transmission  and \ndistribution losses are particularly notable achievements. The challenge for the future is to meet \nthe  rapidly  expanding  demands  of  the  economy  and  population,  with  minimum  disruption, \nhopefully  with  further  improvements  in  service  quality  and  without  unreasonable  increases  in \ncosts to consumers \n\n6. \nElectricity  generation  in  Viet  Nam  grew  at  annual  compounded  rate  of  13.7%  during \n1995\u20132007  and  since  2000  the  annual  growth  rate  has  exceeded  15%.  Electricity  generation \nhas  grown  by  three  fold  during  the  last  8  years  to  reach  67  terawatt  hours  in  2004  compared \nwith  23.7  terawatt  hours  in  1999.  The  forecasted  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth \nexceeding  7%  for  2005\u20132010  coupled  with  the  increasing  share  of  industrial  output  in  Viet \nNam\u2019s  GDP  will  maintain  the  growth  momentum  in  electricity  demand.  The  reserve  margin \nbecomes very low during the dry season and this becomes even worse in northern Viet Nam as \nmost of the generation capacity in northern Viet Nam is hydro.  \n\nTable A2: Historic Demand and Generation Data (2005-09) \n\nItem \nAnnual demand (gigawatt-hour) \nPeak demand in dry season \n(megawatt) \nGrowth in annual demand (%) \nInstalled capacity \nDry season available capacity  \nReserve margin in dry season (%) \nSource: Ministry of Industry and Trade. \n\n2005 \n  53,400 \n9,018 \n \n\n2006 \n  59,800 \n  10,157 \n\n2007 \n67,100 \n11,235 \n\n2008 \n 75,400 \n 12,782 \n\n \n15.2 \n  10,907 \n   9,018 \n4 \n\n \n11.9 \n  11,714 \n  10,243 \n1 \n    \n\n  12.3 \n13,419 \n11,288 \n0 \n   \n\n \n12.3 \n 16,383 \n 13,346 \n4 \n \n\n2009 \n 84,600 \n 14,286 \n\n  12.3 \n 19,084 \n 17,173 \n20.0 \n \n\n \n7. \nAccess  to  electricity  in  rural  areas  increased  dramatically  during  1996\u20132004,  marking \none of the most successful recent rural electrification programs in the world. The number of rural \nhouseholds  with  access  to  electricity  increased  from  50.7%  in  1996  to  92%  in  2007.  Rural \nhousehold  access  rates  are  expected  to  increase  during  the  next  several  years,  although \nachievement of access among the final 5% of rural households will not be easy. The success of \nViet  Nam's  program  lies  especially  with  the  commitment  of  the  Government  to  rural \nelectrification, and the definition and systematic implementation of national plans as a matter of \npriority, as well as public investment and support to match community funds.  \n\nTransmission and distribution losses in EVN's system have fallen steadily over the last \n8. \ndecade  to  12.2%  in  2007.  This  is  not  unreasonable  for  a  system  such  as  Viet  Nam's  at  its \ncurrent  stage  of  development,  especially  given  the  heavy  role  of  low-voltage  residential \nconsumers,  but  further  improvement  is  possible.  In  the  future,  the  Electricity  Regulatory \nAuthority of Viet Nam must monitor efficiency indicators carefully against various benchmarks. \nManagement  of  consumer  accounts  receivable  has  been  exceptionally  effective  for  a \ndeveloping country, with accounts receivable in 2007 equivalent to only about 17 days of sales. \nNontechnical  losses,  including  theft,  are  low  compared  with  many  countries.  Widespread \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nanecdotal evidence points to substantial improvements in the quality of electricity service over \nthe last 10 years, with basic service for most customers in urban or periurban areas becoming \nnoticeably more reliable. However, systematic statistical monitoring of service interruptions and \nvoltage drops, by service area and customer voltage, is lacking. \n\n9. \nThe  tariff  was  D880  per  kilowatt  hour  (kWh)  in  2004  ($0.056/kWh).  This  is  lower  than \nthe  average  retail  price  today  in  most  countries.  The  financial  position  of  EVN  has  remained \nsound with unit revenue remaining stable during the last few years through 2007, covering all of \nits  direct  and  indirect  costs,  but  this  revenue  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the  future.  Viet  Nam's \npower tariff is sophisticated in structure, with rates varying by voltage level and consumer type, \nand  offering  time-of-day  rates  for  major  consumers.  Urban  residential  rates  increase \nprogressively  with  increasing  consumption.  Rural  rates  are  cross-subsidized  by  other \nconsumers. Both average urban residential rates and rural residential rates are modestly cross-\nsubsidized by higher rates for industry and commerce. \n\nC. \n\nMain Power Sector Issues \n\n1. \n\nMeeting Power Demand  \n\n10. \nThe  demand  for  electric  power  is  the  paramount  challenge  for  Viet  Nam's  power \nindustry.  Key  drivers  of  the  country's  economic  growth,  especially  manufacturing,  and \ncommercial and service industries, are highly dependent upon power supply. Reliable electricity \nservice  is  essential  for  light  industries  to  remain  competitive  with  similar  industries  in \nneighboring countries. Electricity has also become an expected basic element in the livelihood \nof  most  people,  and  an  essential  part  of  increasing  standards  of  living.  The  power  shortages \nexperienced  in  the  dry  seasons  of  2005\u20132008  clearly  reinforced  a  priority  focus  on  meeting \ndemand  throughout  Viet  Nam's  power  industry,  with  highly  visible  national  attention.  The \ncapacity shortfall was estimated at some 1,500\u20132,000 MW during peak load. The shortage was \ncaused by the coincidence of severe drought conditions; reducing hydropower production, with \nan  extremely  thin  reserve  margin  in  the  overall  system,  due  to  an  inability  to  develop  new \ncapacity over a short time to meet the higher than expected surges in power demand.  \n\nViet  Nam\u2019s  overall  strategy  is  to  develop  existing  hydropower  resources  and  the  coal \n11. \nand gas plants, subject to the availability of domestic fuel resources, relatively quickly as both \nexploitable  domestic  coal  supplies  and  offshore  gas  supplies  entail  supply  constraints.  The \navailability of domestic coal for the power industry is capped by domestic resource limits, given \ncurrent technology, and exports. Expanding the gas supply requires not only field and pipeline \ndevelopment, but also exploration and firming up of reserves. \n\n12. \nCoal-Based Power Generation. Assessment of best balances between coal- and gas-\nfired  power  is  a  key  long-term  planning  issue,  which  is  highly  sensitive  to  future  relative  fuel \nprice  and  supply  expectations.  With  the  country's  coal  resources  limited,  the  Government's \nstrategy  is  to  strictly  cap  exports,  in  favor  of  expanding  domestic  supply\u2014essentially  to \npostpone the expected eventual need for coal imports. Although high-quality anthracite obtains \na  premium  price  on  the  international  market,  domestic  coal  prices  for  power  generation  are \nmaintained  below  international  prices.  At  current  domestic  coal  prices,  power  generation  from \ndomestic coal is significantly less expensive than combined-cycle, gas-based power generation \nat  capacity  factors  exceeding  50%\u201360%.  However,  in  economic  terms,  considered  from  the \nperspective of the country as a whole, the value of domestic coal used for power generation is \nhigher than its current price, as it can be exported for more money, which would accrue to Viet \nNam. However, development of large-scale power generation using Viet Nam's offshore natural \ngas resources requires aligning the interests of a series of institutional participants, and major \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nupfront financing and long-term commitments. On the gas exploration and development side, for \nthe longer term Viet Nam must maintain an attractive framework for international companies to \ncontinue  exploration  and  firm  up  reserves,  as  much  potential  remains  unexplored.  Once  the \nmain  options  for  generation  from  domestic  coal  and  gas  have  been  exploited,  thermal  power \ngeneration using imported coal is expected to be the most cost-effective option. \n\n13. \nGas-Based  Power  Generation.  PetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation,  PetroVietnam's \nsubsidiary  charged  with  natural  gas  operations,  is  a  central  entity,  holding  the  Government's \nshares  in  field  production  facilities,  retaining  the  sole  rights  in  most  cases  to  buy  offshore gas \nand  sell  gas  to  end-users,  and  charged  with  gas  transmission  system  development  (although \nthis  may  be  in  cooperation  with  international  companies).  Upstream  gas  exploration  and \ndevelopment  is  undertaken  in  joint-venture  or  production-sharing  arrangements  between \nPetroVietnam  Gas  Corporation  and  international  petroleum  companies.  On  the  power \ngeneration  side,  development  of \ninvestors \nindependent  of  EVN  is  essential  for  a  large  portion  of  the  power  generation  capacity,  due  to \nEVN's limited financing capacity. Finally, the Government (aside from its ownership position of \nthe  specific  development \nPetroVietnam  and  EVN)  must  play  key  roles:  sanctioning \narrangements and providing some type of partial risk coverage for electricity sale arrangements \nto outside investors. \n\nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs)  with \n\nHydropower  Development.  With  goals  to  provide  almost  6,000  MW  over  the  medium \n14. \nterm,  Viet  Nam's  program  to  develop  its  many  medium-sized  hydro  sites  will  provide  a  core \ncontribution to the overall power development program in each of the three geographic regions. \nParticular  advantages  include  development  of  a  source  of  domestic  renewable  energy  quite \nseparate from international energy price and security risks, and benefits from associated water \ncontrol in many cases. Although economics vary by site, costs are generally quite competitive \nwith the thermal power options in Viet Nam. Viet Nam has made substantial progress during the \nlast  5  years  in  upgrading  its  reservoir  resettlement  and  environmental  assessment  practices. \nCurrent policies provide a reasonably well-structured set of legal and regulatory requirements. \nFinancial  commitments  for  resettlement  work  in  new  projects  are  now  substantial.  The  most \ndifficult issues, including restoration of livelihoods for ethnic minorities that may be affected by \nreservoir  development,  are  complex  in  every  country,  and  require  concerted  efforts  in \nconsultation with local residents throughout implementation. \n\n15. \nRenewable  Energy  Development.  Viet  Nam's  renewable  energy  development \nprogram is growing, and can provide an increasing contribution in the future. Development has \nfocused  especially  on  off-grid  power  supply  in  isolated  areas;  but  small  hydro  facilities,  in \nparticular, can also provide an important source of renewable energy to the grid. Wind power \ngeneration  may  also  provide  a  small  contribution.  Viet  Nam  plans  to  develop  nuclear  energy \ncapacity over the long term. Both MOIT and EVN have developed demand-side management \nand  energy  efficiency  programs  in  recent  years.  Load  management  programs  and  energy \nefficiency  promotion  and  investment  programs  are  proven  means  to  address  capacity \nconstraints  that  are  far  less  expensive  than  new  capacity.  Such  efforts  can  yield  results \nrelatively quickly in some cases, but do require sophisticated institutional development, which \nhas proved challenging in most countries. \n\n2. \n\nFinancing the Investment  \n\nAnnual  power  sector  investment  requirements  to  meet  power  demand  during  2005\u2013\n16. \n2010  are  expected  to  be  over  $3  billion.  The  country  seeks  to  mobilize  investment  through  a \nvariety  of  vehicles,  from  both  domestic  and  foreign  sources,  to  meet  this  challenge.  The  two \nbasic categories include EVN's contribution to investment from its own resources and different \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\ntypes  of  borrowing,  and  independent  investment,  primarily  by  IPPs.  Financing  of  new \ninvestment through the current EVN system, including sub entities, is essential for key parts of \nthe  construction  effort,  including  the  network,  most  of  the  hydropower  program,  and  selected \nelements  in  the  thermal  power  program.  EVN  exhibited  strong  financial  performance  during \n2002\u20132007, allowing a substantial self-financing contribution to the investment program. \n\n17.  With increased costs stemming in part from power shortages, and the sharp increases \nin investment requirements, self-financing ratios will plummet unless EVN's unit sales revenue \nincreases substantially. The corporation is proceeding to borrow from a wide variety of sources, \nincluding  by  issuing  bonds.  However,  EVN  will  reach  borrowing  limits  very  quickly,  unless \nrevenues  are  increased  (or  a  major  injection  of  equity  is  made,  which  is  unlikely). \nOverextension of borrowing above internationally recognized ratios would be highly imprudent, \nas  maintenance  of  EVN's  creditworthiness  is  essential  for  any  sustainable  investment \nmobilization effort. Average retail power prices must be increased quickly to cover greater costs \nbut  also,  especially,  to  expand  revenues  for  financing  the  massive  power  sector  expansion. \nUltimately, consumers must contribute to the financing of the new capacity to meet their needs. \nPower  prices  in  Viet  Nam  are  relatively  low  by  international  standards,  including  industrial \ntariffs, especially in the residential sector. \n\n18. \nClearly,  dramatic  increases  in  power  sector  investment  from  outside  EVN  will  be \nrequired  to  meet  overall  sector  investment  requirements.  Viet  Nam  is  pursuing  a  full  range  of \nIPP  arrangements  in  its  efforts  to  meet  the  huge  and  rapid  increases  in  power  demand.  IPP \narrangements  for  new  power  plants  include  (i)  build-operate-transfer  or  build-operate-own \nventures  wholly  owned  by  other  public-owned  Vietnamese  entities,  (ii)  joint-venture  build-\noperate-transfer  or  build-operate-own  arrangements,  involving  EVN  investment  with  other \nparticipants (local public or foreign), and (iii) build-operate-transfer arrangements wholly owned \nby foreign parties, either public or private. In addition, new joint-stock company IPPs are being \ncreated  from  EVN's  partial  divestiture  of  existing  power  plants.  In  the  case  of  Viet  Nam,  few \npublic  entities  have  the  resources  and  interest  to  make  major  power  generation  investments, \nand  are,  for  the  most  part,  limited  to  the  state-owned  fuel  supply  companies  or  large \nconstruction companies. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n30 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral Policy Framework \n\n1. \ncoordination among ministries.  \n \n\n1. \n\nActions Taken \n\nSECTOR ROAD MAP FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND RURAL  \nELECTRIFICATION SECTORS \n\nThe  general  policy  framework  for  renewable  energy  needs  improvement,  as  does \n\nThe  Electricity  Law  includes  provisions  for  \u201cpreferential  pricing\u201d  for  renewable  energy \n\n2. \n(though without defining precisely what that means) \n \n\n2. \n\nActions Proposed (by Draft Renewable Energy Master Plan) \n\nEstablish  a  renewable  energy  fund  (to  provide  stable  funding  for  off-grid  renewable \n3. \nenergy  schemes,  subsidies  for  grid-connected  schemes,  and  support  for  renewable  energy \nresource data development and research and development). \n \nEnact a renewable energy law (to provide authority for the renewable energy fund). The \n4. \nProject includes a technical assistance component to assist in preparing the renewable energy \nlaw,  and  detailed  supporting  decrees  for  implementation,  (e.g.,  criteria  for  disbursement  of \nsubsidies  to  off-grid  schemes,  and  introduction  of  competitive  processes  for  subsidies  to  grid-\nconnected projects). \n \n5. \nCreate  a  new  and  separate  office  within  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  for \nthe  promotion  of  renewable  energy  (the  renewable  energy  development  office  funded  by  a \nbudget  allocation  from  the  renewable  energy  fund).

Few countries have competitive \nbidding for small hydro projects (and those that tried, such as Brazil, soon gave up). However, \nthe present process encourages hoarding of sites, and MOIT and provincial authorities should \nallow some kind of competitive process in the selection of developers. \n \n12. \nImprove  and  formalize  benefit-sharing  procedures  for  small  hydro  projects.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  has  supported  the  development  of  benefit  sharing  for  larger  hydropower \nplants,  but small  hydropower  plants  of  less  than  30  MW  are  to  be  exempt.  In  some  instances \nsmall  off-grid  electrification  schemes  have  been  preempted  by  larger  cascade  developments, \nbut with no requirement to provide electricity to local communities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImprove the Prospects for Carbon Finance   \n\n13. \nViet  Nam\u2019s track  record  is  poor compared  with  other countries  with  similar  small hydro \nresource endowments (only two projects approved, dozens of project design documents (PDDs) \nare  stuck  at  various  stages  of  approval).  Many  problems  need  to  addressed,  including \ninconsistencies in emission factor calculations, poor argumentation for additionality, and lack of \ntechnical  capacity  for  PDD  preparation.  A  significant  problem  is  buyers\u2019  preference  for  large-\nscale  projects:  the  transaction  costs  for  both  buyers  and  sellers  are  high,  and  a  single  small \nproject of 2\u201310 MW has difficulty attracting interest of potential buyers \n \n\na. \n\nActions Taken or Under Way \n\n14.  MOIT is about to issue guidelines for calculation of emission coefficients (along the lines \nof a similar process in the People\u2019s Republic of China) \n \n15.  MOIT  is  negotiating  with  the  Carbon  Finance  Unit  of  the  World  Bank  to  provide  an \numbrella facility for carbon financing  \n \n\nb. \n\nActions Remaining \n\nThe present national approval procedure by the Designated National Authority for PDDs \n16. \nis  long  and  cumbersome,  with  open-ended  time  frames  and  obscure  criteria  that  create \nproblems for developers. The steps required include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nissuance  of  regulations  specifying  the  time  that  a  PDD  is  open  for  comments \nfrom ministry representatives; \nelectronic consultation and request for review process; \npermanent Designated National Authority staff work solely on CDM projects; and \nthe Designated National Authority publishes a monthly or quarterly newsletter in \nVietnamese that provides update information regarding CDM procedures as well \nas domestic, regional, and international carbon markets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n32 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n3. \n\nIntroduce  Support  Schemes  for  Renewable  Energy  Technologies  Other \nthan Small Hydro  \n\nThe avoided cost tariff will unlikely enable technologies other than small hydro projects \n17. \nand  some  bagasse  projects.  However,  many  biomass  projects  (plus  some  geothermal  and \nlandfill gas) are viable at the economic avoided cost of the buyer. \n \n\na. \n\nActions Required \n\n18. \nProviding  a  subsidy  in  a  cost-effective  manner  to  renewable  energy  technologies \nrequires  a  carefully  designed  competitive  system.  Two  options  are  proposed  for  renewable \nenergy:  competitive  award  of  concession  fee  for  the  right  to  sell  into  the  grid  at  the  economic \nprice or bidding for a subsidy. \n \n19. \nFor subsidies to be bankable (i.e., to be considered in a lender\u2019s assessment of project \nfinancing),  a  subsidy  agreement  with  similar  commercial  standing  as  power  purchase \nagreements is required. \n \n20. \nQuite  apart  from  the  poor  economics  of  grid-connected  wind  power,  data  on  the  wind \nresource  remains  poor,  and  multiyear  data  at  60  meters  height  is  simply  not  available  (or  is \nclaimed to be proprietary). Data on the geothermal resource is similarly poor. Without adequate \ndata (in the public domain), drawing conclusions about the desirability of Government policies to \nencourage these technologies is difficult. \n \nC. \n\nOff-Grid Renewable Energy \n\n21. \nThe  current  subsidy  policy  is  biased  against  off-grid  projects.  While  grid-connected \ndomestic rural consumers have a tariff cap of D700/kWh, with the implied subsidy carried on the \nbooks  of  the  power  companies,  in  off-grid  systems  much  higher  tariffs  are  common,  largely \nbecause  subsidy  support  from  the  Government  is  reluctantly  provided  (under  ad  hoc \narrangements,  or  commitments  contingent  upon  availability  of  funds).  Yet,  off-grid  systems \nserve  some  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poorest  households,  raising  doubts  about  the  equity  of  the  present \ntariff  policy.  The  problem  is  aggravated  by  the  reluctance  of  development  partners  to  provide \noperating  subsidies;  while  capital  investment  is  provided  (as  in  the  case  of  the  Viet  Nam\u2013\nSweden renewable energy program); no support is given to provide operating subsidies. \n \n\n1. \n\nActions Required \n\n22. \nReview the present tariff policy that caps the tariff for domestic consumers connected to \nthe national grid, but not for off-grid customers. Establish a mechanism to provide subsidies for \noff-grid (and offshore island) customers. (For example, the Ly Son wind-diesel hybrid scheme, \nproposed for inclusion in the proposed Asian Development Bank project, was dropped for lack \nof a sustainable source of subsidy support). A rural electrification fund has been proposed as a \ncross-subsidy mechanism in favor of the power companies with a significant burden of high-cost \nrural customers. Whether this mechanism will be available to cover the subsidy requirements of \noff-grid customers\u2019 needs to be settled. \n \nEstablish  policies  and  procedures  for  providing  capital  subsidies  to  off-grid  renewable \n23. \nenergy  schemes  (as  would  be  adopted  by  the  proposed  renewable  energy  fund).  Subsides \nshould only be provided where at least one of the following conditions is present: \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3\n\n33\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  scheme  is  bundled  with  small  hydro  project  rehabilitation  or  a  new  small \nhydro project connected to the grid to provide sustainable finance for the off-grid \nscheme;  \nthe scheme is provided support by a district wide or province wide support entity \nthat  provides  technical  expertise  and  support  for  operation  and  maintenance \nincludes  some  significant  productive  use  (to  provide  remunerative  customers, \nand improve project economics by increasing load factors); and \na program is being initiated to promote productive use in rural areas, to include a \nmechanism for financing electric equipment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n34 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nProject \nLoans \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SUBSECTOR \n \n\nFunding \nSource \n \n\nAmount \n(million) \n \n\nSaigon Power Project \nPower Distribution and Rehabilitation Project \nCentral and Southern Viet Nam Power Distribution \nProject \nNorthern Power Transmission (Sector) Project \n\nNorthern Power Transmission Expansion Sector \nProject \n\nMong Dung 1 Thermal Power Project \n\nSong Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n\nRural Electrification Project \nRural Electrification Project in South \nNorthern Power Transmission Project \nPhi My Thermal Power Plant Project \n\nPhi Lai Thermal Power Plant Project \n\nHam Thuan\u2013Da Mi Hydropower Project \n\nDa Nhim Power Plant Rehabilitation Project \n\nO Mon Thermal Power Plant and Mekong Delta \nTransmission Network Project \nDai Ninh Hydropower Project \nPhi My\u2013Ho Chi Minh City 500 kV Transmission Line \nProject \nNinh Binh II Thermal Power Plant \nNghi Son Thermal Power Plant \nPower Sector Loan \nO Mon Thermal Power Plant Unit 2 Construction \nProject  \nDai Ninh Hydropower Project (III) \nThad Mo Hydropower Station Extension Project \n\nSmall-Scale Pro-poor Infrastructure Development \nProject \nPower Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project \n\nPower Development Project \n\nTransmission, Distribution, and Disaster \nReconstruction  \nRural Energy Project \n\nSystem Energy, Equalization and Renewable Energy \nProject \nSecond Rural Energy Project  \n\nSecond Transmission and Distribution \n\n \n\nADB \nADB \nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nADB \n\nAFD \nAFD \nAFD \nJBIC \n\nJBIC \n\nJBIC \n\nJBIC \n\nJBIC \n\nJBIC \nJBIC \n\nJBIC \nJBIC \nJBIC \nJBIC \n\nJBIC \nJBIC \n\nJBIC \n\nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \nWorld \nBank \n\n$6.3 \n$80.0 \n$100.0 \n\n$120.0 \n\n$360.0 \n\n$28.0 \n\n$198.0 \n\n \nYear \n \n\n1972 \n1995 \n1997 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2004 \n2003 \n\n1995 \n\n1996 \n\n1998 \n\n2000 \n\n2002 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n\u20ac19.0 \n$23.0 \n\u20ac40.0 \n\u00a561,932.0 \n\n2000 \n2001 \n2004 \n1993\u20131998 \n\n\u00a572,826.0 \n\n1993\u20131998 \n\n\u00a553,074.0 \n\n1993\u20131997 \n\n\u00a57,000.0 \n\n1996 \n\n\u00a543,819.0 \n\n2000\u20132006 \n\n\u00a533,172.0 \n\u00a513,127.0 \n\n1998\u20132003 \n2000 \n\n2004\u20132005 \n2006 \n2003 \n2003 \n\n$44.0 \n\n1997\u20132006 \n\n\u00a533,864.0 \n\u00a520,943.0 \n\u00a53,190.0 \n\u00a527,547.0 \n\n\u00a519,142.0 \n\u00a55,972.0 \n\n$165.0 \n\n$180.0 \n\n$199.0 \n\n$150.0 \n\n$225.0 \n\n$220.0 \n\n$220.0 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n \n\n \nProject \nConstruction of Song Hahn Multipurpose Hydropower \nPlant \nHa Tin 500 kV Substation \nPower Distribution Project in Central Area \nUpgrading Rural Substations \n\nFunding \nSource \nSida \n\nAmount \n(million) \nSKr213.0 \n\nSida \nSida \nSida \n\nSKr55.0 \nSKr60.0 \nSKr60.0 \n\n \nYear \n1995 \n\n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, kV = kilovolt, JBIC = Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. \nSources: ADB, AFD, JBIC, Sida, and World Bank.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \nA. \n\nSmall Hydropower Projects \n\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF SUBPROJECTS \n\n1. \nThe  Renewable  Energy  for  Remote  Communes  Sector  Project  is  based  on  three \npropositions:  (i)  that  the  scale  of  small  hydro  subprojects  to  serve  small  groups  of  remote \nhouseholds is generally uneconomic because the load factor of mainly domestic consumption is \nvery low; (ii) the poor scale economies of small generating units imply high costs/kilowatt (kW); \nand (iii) electrifying these households by grid expansion requires long lines to serve small loads, \nand  therefore  is  equally  uneconomic.  The  proposed  solution  is  to  promote  small  hydro \nsubprojects of sufficient size to make a grid connection economic (and selling to the grid at the \nnew avoided cost tariff), but to divert some proportion of the output to electrify local households \nat  the  national  consumer  tariff.  Since  grid  sales  are  expected  to  account  for  the  bulk  of  the \nrevenue, the financial sustainability of the subprojects is assured. \n \nConsultants  fielded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  first  screened,  through  a \n2. \ndesk  study,  potential  hydropower  sites  based  on  subproject  proposals  from  the  provincial \npeople\u2019s committees of Lai Chau Province and Dien Bien Province, served by Power Company \n1  (PC  1).  Later,  Viet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN)  requested  that  Quang  Nam  and  Hue  provinces \nserved  by  Power  Company  3  (PC  3)  also  be  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  scope  of  work.  The \nselection criteria for the long-list of subprojects was that (i) the installed capacity should range \nbetween 500 kW and 6,000 kW;1 (ii) an existing (or planned and sure to come) 35 kV line should \nbe within about 20 km of the proposed power plant; (iii) unserved households should be close to \nthe power plant and along the route of the proposed medium voltage (MV) transmission line; (iv) \nthe institution arrangements must allow the local population to benefit from the revenue resulting \nfrom the generated electricity; and (v) minimal relocation and resettlement should result (i.e., the \nsmall hydropower plant should be within ADB\u2019s category B environment classification).  \n \n3. \nHydrological  records  for  Lai  Chau  and  Dien  Bien  were  not  available  for  any  of  the \nproposed sites, so assumptions had to be made on regional considerations in terms of adopted \nflow  duration  curves  and  average  runoff.  However,  rainfall  is  high  in  this  part  of  Viet  Nam \nexceeding  2,500  millimeters/year  and  resulting  in  an  annual  runoff  modulus  exceeding  \n60 liters/second/square kilometer (km2) in many parts of Lai Chau Province.2,3 About 72% of the \nrain  falls  during  May  to  August,  with  highest  runoff  being  1  month  later.  For  indicative  design \npurposes,  a  design  flow  of  40 liters/second/km2  was  adopted  for  subprojects  in  Lai  Chau \nprovince  and  30 liters/second/km2  in  Dien  Bien  Province.  Maps  with  a  scale  of  1:50,000  were \nused  to  identify  potential  sites  and  estimate  available  head.4 Four  proposed  subprojects  had \nheads  ranging  between  10  and  15 meters  (m).  The  remaining  subprojects  had  more  suitable \nheads of between 35 m and 185 m. As an initial approximation, the turbines were dimensioned \nto operate at full capacity between 4,500 and 5,200 hours per year. Following the desk study, \nthe  consultant  visited  the  best  sites  to  verify  the  suitability  of  the  dam  site  and  powerhouse \nlocations, approximate alignment of waterways, and available head. \n \nTentative cost estimates based on desk studies and verifications on site were made for \n4. \nfour subprojects: Nam Nghe 1, Na Say, Ta Con, and Na Son hydropower subprojects. The unit \n\n                                                 \n1   The upper limit was subsequently increased to 7.5 MW when EVN requested inclusion of projects under PC 3.  \n2   NWCR, Viet Nam Water Resources Atlas, Institute of Hydro Meteorological Services. Hanoi \n3   Mean annual rainfall in Hue and Quang Nam provinces\u2019 mountainous areas range between 3,200 and 3,600 mm \nwith  about  63%  falling  during  September  to  December.  The  annual  runoff  modulus  is  in  the  range  60\u201380 \nliters/second/km2, with about 68% of the annual runoff occurring during October\u2013December.  \n\n4   Head: difference  in elevation between water level at head pond and water level at power plant tailrace \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37\n\ncosts  ranges  between  $882/kW  (rehabilitation)  and  $2,500/kW  (new  construction).  The  cost \nestimates for other hydropower plants are based on unit costs of around $2,000/kW\u2013$2,200/kW. \nThe costs of transmission lines at 35 kV are based on estimated distance between the power \nplant  and  the  nearest  connection  to  the  grid.  Distribution  line  costs  (0.4  kV)  are  based  on  the \naverage per household connection cost (including local MV line, low voltage [LV] lines and step-\ndown transformers) of the four subprojects listed. \n \nIn  Lai  Chau  Province,  the  consultants  identified  eight  power  subprojects  (one  with  two \n5. \nalternatives) totaling 13.8\u201316.8 MW of installed capacity.5 The potential mean annual generation \nwould be about 67\u201380 GWh at a total cost of $40 million\u2013$46 million, including $10 million for \n182 km of 35 kV MV transmission lines. The subprojects would provide electricity to about 2,174 \nhouseholds that would require about 1.5 GWh6 of electricity per year, leaving about 65\u201378 GWh \navailable for sale to the EVN grid. Providing electricity to all 2,174 households would require an \ninvestment of about $3 million in distribution facilities.7 This corresponds to about 7% of the cost \nof the power plant and transmission line to the grid. To provide electricity to all the households \nwith grid-connected small hydro would therefore require about $43 million\u2013$49 million.  \n \n6. \nIn  Dien  Bien  Province,  the  consultant  identified  10  subprojects  totaling  19.6  MW  of \ninstalled capacity. The potential mean annual generation would be about 81 GWh at a total cost \nof $44 million, including $0.9 million for 20 km of MV transmission lines. The subprojects would \nprovide  electricity  to  about  5,665  households,  requiring  about  4  GWh  of  electricity  per  year, \nleaving  about  77  GWh  available  for  sale  to  the  EVN  grid.  To  provide  electricity  to  all  5,665 \nhouseholds  would  require  an  investment  of  about  $7.7 million  in  distribution  facilities.  This \ncorresponds to about 17% of the cost of the power plant and transmission line to the grid. To \nelectrify all communes with grid-connected small hydro would require about $52 million. \n \n7. \nSince the cost of the proposed subprojects of about $100 million exceeds the available \nfunds under the proposed ADB loan (about $60 million), a representative number of subprojects \nfrom  Lai  Chau  and  Dien  Bien  had  to  be  selected.  Subprojects  were  ranked  according  to \n(i) levelized costs of generation, (ii) energy available for sale to the grid (will increase revenues \nfor further rural electrification), (iii) number of households close to the subproject that could be \nelectrified,  and  (iv)  an  attractiveness  factor8 (reflecting  technical  ranking)  (Table  A5.1).  Since \nsubprojects are small and unlikely to affect many people, the negative social and environmental \nimpact  was  not  considered  at  this  stage,  although  it  will  need  to  be  considered  during  the \nfeasibility studies. The following subprojects were selected to be included in the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   The hydropower potential of small hydropower projects in Lai Chau and Dien Bien is much higher than the list here, \nbut  many  subprojects  have  been  reserved  by  the  private  sector,  and  memorandums  of  understanding  and \ndevelopment licenses have already been issued. \n\n6   Assumes  consumption  of  740  kWh/household  per  year  or  2  kWh/day,  equivalent  to  about  200  watts  average \n\ndomestic load. \n\n7   This assumes an average unit cost of $1,360 per household. This cost is based on estimates for Ta Con, Na Son, \nNa say, and Nam Nghe 1 hydropower projects and includes local MV lines. Without the MV line the unit cost for LV \nvoltage alone, but including step-down transformers, is $550/household. \n\n8   The \u201cattractiveness factor\u201d AF = f*\u221a(P*H), where P: design capacity (will give higher energy output at a given site \nand valuable peaking capacity), H: available head (high head projects are normally lower unit cost that low head \nprojects), and f: plant factor (high value will indicate higher utilization). The higher the number, the more attractive \nthe subproject. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n38 \n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTable A5.1: Shortlista \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \nEnergy \nOutput \nCost \n(GWh)  ($ million)\n\nLevelized \nCosts \n($/kWh) \n \n0.059 \n0.068 \n0.083 \n0.062 \n\nItem \n \nLai Chau Province \nNam Nghe1b, 2.8 MW \nNam Ha B \nNam Ngoc \nNam So \n \n \nDien Bien Province \nNa Son (Na Phat) \nSinh Phing \nNam Huoi Ku \nNam He \n \nGWh = gigawatt hour, kWh = kilowatt hour, MW = megawatt. \na   EVN requested that (i) Aroang hydropower plant in Hue Province with an estimate installed capacity of 7.2 MW and \nan investment cost of $7.5 million; and (ii) Dakpring hydropower plant with an estimate installed capacity of 8 MW \nand an investment cost of $9.1 million, also be considered under the Project. \n\nAttractiveness \nFactor \n \n \n561 \n195 \n225 \n166 \n166-561 \n \n \n102 \n207 \n449 \n285 \n102-449 \n\nHouseholds to be \nProvided with \nElectricity \n($ million) \n \n256 \n298 \n457 \n260 \n1,271 \n \n \n555 \n796 \n1,237 \n500 \n3,088 \n\nEnergy \nfor Grid\n(GWh) \n \n16.8 \n7.9 \n8.3 \n9.5 \n42.5 \n \n \n9.5 \n4.0 \n14.8 \n23.6 \n51.9 \n\n \n8.74 \n4.91 \n6.43 \n5.22 \n25.30 \n \n \n5.57 \n3.40 \n9.67 \n14.86 \n33.50 \n\n17.0 \n8.1 \n8.7 \n9.7 \n43.5 \n \n \n9.9 \n4.6 \n15.7 \n24.0 \n54.2 \n\n0.060 \n0.062 \n0.063 \n0.073 \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank consultants, 2008. \n \nB. \n\nNam Nghe 1 Small Hydropower Subproject \n\n8. \nThe Nam Nghe 1 small hydropower plant is located on the Nam Nghe River in Hua Bum \ncommune,  Muong  Te  district,  in  Lai  Chau  Province.  With  an  annual  precipitation  of \n2,500 millimeters/year  and  a  catchment  of  35  km2,  the  mean  annual  flow  is  estimated  at \n2.8 cubic  meters  (m3)/second  (s),  ranging  between  an  average  of  0.7  m3/s  in  March  and  \n8.5  m3/s  in  July.  The  firm  flow  (90%)  is  estimated  at  0.54 m3/s.  The  power  plant  tentatively \nconsists  of a  concrete overflow  weir  on  the  Nam  Nghe  River  with  a  maximum  height  of  about  \n14 m but with little pondage, a 1,400 m long headrace canal lined with reinforced concrete on \nthe right bank of the river, a 340 m long steel penstock, and a powerhouse. The available head \nis  185  m.  The  powerhouse,  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Nam  Nghe  River  and  close  to  the \nconfluence with  the  Nam  Bum  River,  will  be  located  within  some  rice  fields,  which  will  require \ncompensation. It will contain two Pelton-type turbines with a design discharge of 1.9 m3/s, giving \na  total  capacity  of  2.8 MW.  The  estimated  annual  energy  output  is  17.0 GWh.  Firm  power  is \nestimated at 0.8 MW, which corresponds to 19 MWh/day of generation. The subproject will be \noptimized  during  the  technical  design  following  more  in-depth  engineering  studies  including \ndetailed topographic surveys, and hydrological and geological studies. \n \n9. \nFive  hamlets  within  10  km  of  the  power  plant  have  a  total  of  136  households  and  one \nborder post with 35 border guards, who will benefit from the local 0.4 kV LV distribution. Along \nthe way to Muong Te, two more hamlets with about 94 households will be electrified. A 35 kV \ntransmission line will transmit power to a substation east of Muang Te town, some 12 km west \nof  the  power  plant.  The  annual  consumption  by  the  230  households  is  estimated  at  0.2 GWh \n(613 kWh/day),  leaving  16.8 GWh  for  sales  to  the  grid  at  Muong  Te.  In  the  driest  months,  the \npower  plant  will  be  able  to  generate  19,000  kWh/day,  resulting  in  a  surplus  to  be  sold  to  the \ngrid.  Muong  Te  is  scheduled  to  be  connected  at  35  kV  to  the  EVN  grid  in  2009,  before  the \ncommissioning of the Nam Nghe 1 power plant. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n39\n\n10. \nThe cost of the power plant is estimated at $8.2 million including the 35 kV transmission \nline  to  Muong  Te,  while  the  local  transmission  and  distribution  system  is  estimated  at  \n$0.54 million, totaling $8.74 million.  \n \n11. \nBefore bidding, a full feasibility study must be conducted to confirm the feasibility of the \nsubproject.  Consultants  will  conduct  further  detailed  investigations  such  as  topographic \nsurveying and mapping, geological and hydrological investigations, detailed cost estimation, and \noptimization of installed capacity. Following approval of the feasibility study, bid documents will \nbe  prepared  for  civil  works  construction  and  equipment  supply  packages.  The  subproject  will \ntake 2 to 3 years to build. \n \nC. \n\nNetwork  Expansion  and  Rehabilitation  of  Distribution  Network  Serving  Poor \nProvinces \n\n12. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  special  program  of  rural  electrification  to  improve  the \nelectrification  rate  of  poor  provinces  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities\u2014where  the  rate  is \nsignificantly  lower  than  the  national  average.  Under  this  program,  the  state  budget  provides \nfinancing to Power Company 2 (PC 2) and PC 3 to cover 85% of the cost of rural electrification \nin five selected provinces in the Central Highlands.  \n \n13. \nThe  Government  intends  to  extend  this  component  to  cover  five  additional  provinces \n(i.e., Soc Trang and Tra Vinh provinces in the south, Quang Tri Province in the center and Dien \nBien  and  Lai  Chau  provinces  in  the  north),  with  a  total  of  733,681  households.  The  current \nelectrification rate is 83.5%, varying between 36.0% in Lai Chau province and 97.3% in Quang \nTri province. Of the 129,563 households not yet connected, 66,837 will be connected by 2015 \nraising  the  electrification  rate  to  92.6%.  Component  2  of  the  Project  will  finance  the  proposed \ngovernment financing in these five provinces. This component will finance the expansion of the \nrural  distribution  network  to  connect  villages  without  electricity  and  to  rehabilitate  the  existing \nlow voltage network in poorly constructed low voltage networks serving remote communes. The \nproject scope is expected to include the expansion of the MV network by about 900 km of MV \nlines (at 22 kV and 35 kV), about 1,100 medium to low voltage substations with a total capacity \nof 31 MVA, and about 2,500 km of low voltage (0.4 kV) distribution lines to provide electricity to \nabout  67,000  households,  and  improve  supply  to  a  further  55,000  households  in  more  than \n1,000 villages. The total cost will amount to about $57 million, or $468 per connected household \nTable A5.2 provides the main data for each province being considered included in the Project \nand the overall total.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n40 \n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nItem \nHouseholds \nConnected to grid \n\nNot connected \nTo be connected \nStrengthen existing \ngrid \nTarget electrification \nrate \nRequired Facilities \n22 kV/35 kV lines \nSubstations \n\nTable A5.2: Basic Statistics \n\nSoc \nTrang \n267,380\n243,492\n87.7\n32,887\n20,388\n\n \nTra Vinh \n237,663\n209,648\n86.8\n28,015\n19,923\n\nUnits \nNo. \nNo. \n% \nHH \nHH \nHH \n\nProvince \n\nQuang \nTri \n102,307\n99,268\n97.3\n2,769\n1,639\n54,780\n\nLai \nChau \n55,304 \n19,930 \n36.0 \n35,374 \n17,070 \n \n\nDien \nBien \n71,027 \n40,059 \n57.0 \n30,518 \n7,817 \n \n\n \nTotal \n733,681\n612,397\n83.5\n129,563\n66,837\n54,780\n\n% \n\n95.1\n\n94.1\n\n99.9\n\n66.9 \n\n68.0 \n\n92.6\n\n \n220 \n83 \n5.6 \n242 \n \n14.4 \nAverage unit cost \n841 \nHH = households, km = kilometer, MVA = mega-volt ampere, No. = number, $ = US dollar. \nSource: Viet Nam Electricity, 2008. \n\nKm \nNo. \nMVA \nKm \nD million \n$ million \n$/HH \n\n304\n499\n10.8\n867\n305,377\n18.0\n880\n\n207\n418\n7.4\n654\n226,983\n13.4\n670\n\n0.4 kV lines \nCosts \n\n115\n37\n3.6\n666\n\n7.9\n150\n\nD. \n\nNetwork Expansion for Tra Vinh Province Subproject \n\n \n\n \n42 \n39 \n3.3 \n86 \n \n3.2 \n409 \n\n888\n1,076\n31\n2,515\n964,136\n56.9\n468\n\n14. \nThe economy of Tra Vinh in the Mekong Delta is agriculture-forestry based. Agriculture, \nforestry,  and  fisheries  account  for  more  than  60%  of  the  total  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nHowever,  the  shares  of  construction,  industry,  and  commerce  are  increasing.  In  2007,  the \nprovince\u2019s  total  GDP  was  D6,111  billion,  almost  14%  higher  than  the  previous  year.  Of  Tra \nVinh\u2019s  1.05  million  population,  31%  are  Khmer  (about  328,000).  Annual  per  capita  income  in \n2007  was  D9  million,  lower  than  the  national  average.  The  province  has  61,000  households \nliving under the national poverty line; 29,500 of these are Khmer. \n\n15. \nTra Vinh Province receives electricity from the national grid via the Vung Liem\u2013Tra Vinh \n110  kV  line.  Two  substations  provide  electricity  in  Tra  Vinh  Province:  the  110/22  kV  Tra  Vinh \nsubstation and the 110/22 kV Duyen Hai substation. The Tra Vinh MV network consists of three-\nphase and single-phase 22 kV line totaling about 2,000 km. \n\n16.   Between  2000  and  2007,  the  rural  electrification  rate  in  Tra  Vinh  Province  increased \nfrom  50%  to  86%;  in  2000  only  96  communes  (95,300  households)  had  access  to  grid \nelectricity.  In  2007,  the  corresponding  numbers  are  102  communes  with  204,000  households. \nTable A5.3 shows the rates of access to grid electricity by districts for total households and for \nKhmer households. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n41\n\nDistrict \n\n Tra Vinh town \n\n Cang Long  \n\n Chau Thanh \n\n Cau Ke \n\n Cau Ngang \n\n Duyen Hai \n\n Tieu Can \n\n Tra Cu \n\nTable A5.3: Connection Rates by District \nNo. Khmer  \nHH \n4,340 \n\n% HH with \nAccess to Grid\n92.2 \n\nTotal HH \n\n20,948 \n\n \n\n% Khmer HH with \nAccess to Grid \n87.7 \n\n38,367 \n\n31,571 \n\n27,559 \n\n31,900 \n\n21,684 \n\n26,118 \n\n39,516 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2,305 \n\n10,262 \n\n8,423 \n\n11,626 \n\n3,543 \n\n8,231 \n\n24,101 \n\n72,831 \n\n95.7 \n\n87.2 \n\n80.5 \n\n80.2 \n\n84.8 \n\n87.1 \n\n86.9 \n\n87.0 \n\n76.4 \n\n77.9 \n\n72.5 \n\n75.0 \n\n67.7 \n\n74.8 \n\n88.5 \n\n80.0 \n\nTotal for Province  \nHH = household. \nSource: Power Company No 2. \n\n237,663 \n\n \n17. \nPC 2 has carried out a feasibility study, and proposed that the Government extend the \ngrid  to  unserved  communes.  The  objective  of  the  subproject  is  to  extend  the  MV  and  LV \nnetwork in 83 communes of seven districts in Tra Vinh Province to provide electricity to 19,923 \nhouseholds,  most  of  which  belong  to  the  Khmer  ethnic  group,  the  poorest  people  in  the \nprovince. The subproject will increase the province rural electrification rate from the current 87% \nto  94%,  and  will  specially  target  Khmer  ethnic  households  by  bringing  their  electrification  rate \nfrom the current 80% to 93%. \n\n18. \nThe subproject consists of an MV component and an LV component. For MV (22/15 kV), \nsingle circuit distribution lines will be built to connect seven districts, currently not connected to \nthe grid, to the existing MV grid. The MV component will build one 0.5 km three-phase MV line \nand 206 km of single-phase lines. The MV component includes also 418 transformers in seven \ndistricts (22/15 kV for 3-phase and 12.7/8.6 kV for single-phase). The LV component consists of \n636 km distribution lines and 19,923 drop-down transformers and meters for the corresponding \nnumber of households.  \n\n19. \n\nThe cost of the subproject is estimated at $7.9 million. \n\n20. \nThe average consumer electricity tariff in the province is D550 per kWh, while the buying \nprice  is  D635/kWh.  Distribution  losses  are  7%.  The  operation  and  maintenance  costs  are \nestimated  at  2%  of  the  capital  investment  costs.  For  the  economic  analysis,  PC  2  values  the \nbenefits  of  provision  of  electricity  at  the  estimated  cost  of  energy  not  served  (15  times  the \nconsumer tariff). The subproject is economically viable with the economic internal rate of return \nat 18.6% and present value equal to D103 million.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES \n\nA. \n\nComponent 1: Mini-Hydro Development for Rural Electrification  \n\n1. \n\nSelection Criteria \n\nThe subproject should include the following features: \n\nBe  technically  feasible  and  have  a  capacity  less  than  7.5 megawatts  (MW). \nInstitutional  arrangements  for  ownership,  project  implementation,  and  operation \nand maintenance should be acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nBe  financially  and  economically  viable  after  taking  into  account  the  cost  of  grid \nconnection  and  grid  expansion  to  serve  local  communes.

COST ESTIMATES,  \nAND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE \n \n\nA. \n\nPart  1:  Technical  Assistance  to  Prepare  the  Renewable  Energy  Law  and  Related \nDecrees \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n1. \nThe Government of Viet Nam is considering the enactment of a renewable energy law. It \nwould  declare  the  main  Government  objectives  for  renewable  energy,  and  provide  the \nnecessary  legal  authority  for  establishing  a  renewable  energy  fund,  the  proposed  mechanism \nfor  providing  subsidies  to  renewable  energy  development.1 A  law  is  required  to  provide  the \nauthority and legal certainty of subsidy support to renewable energy development, without which \nsubsidy and support payments will not enable project investment by the private sector. The law \nwill  also  provide  the  necessary  mandate  for  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  to \nassume the central role in renewable energy promotion and development, and to take the lead \nin  policy  coordination  (the  present  lack  of  which  is  an  important  constraint  to  project \ndevelopment).  Finally,  in  the  event  that  the  Government  establishes  binding  targets  for \nrenewable energy, the law provides the authority for setting penalties for noncompliance. \n\n2. \n\nScope of Work \n\n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  recruit  one  international  and  one  national \nindividual consultant to provide technical assistance to MOIT for 12 person-months (4 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  8  person-months  of  national  consulting  inputs). \nThe consultants will report to MOIT and ADB. The selected international consultant will need to \nbe a senior expert of international stature in energy policy. \n\n3. \n\nTerms of Reference \n\n3. \nThe international consultant will assist the Government in preparing a renewable energy \nlaw,  and  in  drafting  the  set  of  implementing  decisions.  The  consultant  will  (i)  consider \nexperience  in  other  countries  to  prepare  an  analysis  of  alternative  ways  of  funding  the \nrenewable  energy  fund:  (ii)  prepare  a  series  of  papers  outlining  the  advantages  and \ndisadvantages  of  alternative  policy  choices;  and  (iii)  assist  in  drafting  the  law  and  the \nimplementing  decisions.  An  important  part  of  the  consultancy  will  be  to  propose  efficient \nmechanisms for the disbursement of subsidies, to be stipulated in the implementation decrees.  \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n4. \nMOIT will be the Implementing Agency and provide counterpart staff, office space, and \nfurniture  without  cost  to  the  consultant.  The  executing  agencies  will  also  provide  available \ndocumentation. \n\n                                                 \n1   A similar law is currently being drafted (with ADB support) in the area of energy efficiency. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n56 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nB. \n\nPart 2: Capacity Building for Mini-Hydropower Development \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n5. \nComponent  1,  Mini  Hydropower  Projects  for  Rural  Electrification  in  Mountainous \nProvinces,  will  be  carried  out  by  two  executing  agencies2 in  Lai  Chau,  Dien  Bien  and  Son  La \n(under Power Company 1 [PC 1]); and Quang Nam and Hue provinces (both under PC 3).

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nViet  Nam  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  in  Asia  for  the  last  two  decades,  with  real  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth  averaging  8.0%  per  annum  during  2003\u20132007;  per  capita  GDP  increased  to  $817  in  2007 \ncompared  with  $441  in  2002.  Although  the  country  has  suffered  from  high  inflation  due  to  high  energy  and  food  prices \nand supply bottlenecks, the long-term growth prospects remain positive. Viet Nam has achieved remarkable progress in \nsocioeconomic development since 1993. The reduction in the national poverty rate from 58% in 1993 to less than 20% by \n2007  is  unprecedented.  However,  poverty  remains  at  over  50%  in  northern  mountain  provinces  inhabited  by  ethnic \nminority communities. The lack of infrastructure facilities and nonfarm income generation activities has contributed to the \npersistent poverty in these isolated areas. The country strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nViet  Nam  focuses  on  supporting  pro-poor  economic  growth,  social  equity  and  balanced  development,  and  sustainable \nenvironment management. One of the key challenges for poverty reduction in Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-economic Development \nPlan (SEDP) is to provide the basic services and infrastructure needed to ensure the access to markets needed to attract \nprivate  investment  and  create  jobs.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  to  help  the  Government  reduce  poverty  by  implementing \nSEDP targets is particularly focused on promoting pro-poor, economic growth. Provision of basic infrastructure is one of \nthe prerequisites. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy emphasizes support for poor, remote, isolated, and ethnic \nminority areas.  \n \nThe  potential  for  electricity  to  facilitate  communication,  income  generation,  and  economic  growth  is  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Currently  91.5%  of  households  in  Viet  Nam  are  connected  to  the  national \npower  grid  system.  The  Government  plans  to  extend  the  system  to  connect  about  96%  of  villages.  Those  remaining \nunconnected  are  communes  in  remote  mountain,  central,  and  southern  provinces,  often  inhabited  by  ethnic  minorities \nwith  40%\u201370%  of  the  population  living  under  the  national  poverty  line.  The  Project  contributes  to  the  Government\u2019s \nobjective of ensuring electricity to 100% of households by 2012. The Project is targeted to connect more than half of the \nremaining villages without access to electricity with mini-hydro schemes and network expansion. It will thus contribute to \nthe Government\u2019s goal of promoting pro-poor and balanced economic development of remote and isolated mountainous \nand isolated communes using renewable energy. \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention (geographical poverty issues [TI-G]) \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis \n1. Key Issues  \nThe Project is designed with a special focus on geographically target poor communities for electrification in the northern, \ncentral,  and  southern  provinces.  It  will  include  remote  communes  and  unelectrified  communes  of  these  provinces. \nElectrification  of  communes  and  villages  without  access  to  electricity  is  one  of  the  criteria  for  selecting  sites  for \ndevelopment of mini-hydropower plants and network expansion under the Project. Given Viet Nam\u2019s rate of electrification \nof  over  90%,  the  remaining  communes  and  villages  to  be  electrified  under  the  Project  are  likely  to  be  poor  communes \nwith  little  access  to  infrastructure  such  as  electricity.  Component  2  for  grid  extension  and  rehabilitation  is  specifically \ntargeted  for  communes  that  are  officially  classified  as  poor  to  receive  government  assistance  under  Program  135  for \npoverty  reduction  and  rural  infrastructure  development  or  at  least  50%  of  households  receiving  electricity  through  a \nsubproject  shall  have  income  level  below  the  national  poverty  rate.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to \nprovide all households in the country with electricity by 2020 as part of rural infrastructure provision in the Government\u2019s \nSEDP.  The  Project  will  contribute  indirectly  to  poverty  reduction  by  providing  electricity  to  households,  and  improving \nsocioeconomic  and  living  standards  in  high-poverty  geographic  areas.  Social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  for  the \ncentral  and  southern  communes  has  not  been  completed  yet.  Social  and  poverty  assessment  for  mountainous \ncommunes indicates that electricity is mainly used for household purposes such as lighting. The scope for productive use \nof electricity in the mountainous communes is limited, especially in ethnic minority dominated areas.  \n2. Design Features \nThe  poor  households  (i.e.,  those  having  a  monthly  income  of  less  than  D200,000  ($13)  per  capita  will  receive  free \nelectricity  connections.  The  Project  thus  contributes  particularly  to  inclusive  social  development  by  improving  living \nconditions, and to a lesser extent to pro-poor economic growth through some additional potential for income generation of \npoor  remote  mountain  communities  through  productive  use  of  electricity.  Under  the  productive  use  of  electricity \ncomponent,  ethnic  minority  individual  households  or  groups  will  be  supported  to  get  access  to  microfinance  from  the \nexisting microfinance program of the Social Policy Bank. Microfinance will be used for productive activities and to create \nincome-earning opportunities through small businesses. The productive use of electricity component will be limited to the \nsubprojects  under  component  1  (mini-hydro).  A  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  will  be  recruited  to  facilitate \nimplementation of microfinance activities.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n62 \n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nLack of electricity is a major  development constraint for the project-targeted communes  for household living standards, \neconomic  activities,  and  service  delivery.  In  remote  mountain  communities,  currently  households  produce  electricity \nthrough  micro-hydropower  generators  and  use  kerosene  lamps  for  lighting.  Government  services  such  as  schools  and \ncommune health care stations have no access to electricity. Income generation is based on low-production,  small-scale \nagriculture  based  on  manual  labor.  Electricity  provision  can  potentially  contribute  to  improving  living  and  production \nconditions, given that people can afford and will have the capacity to utilize electricity. Electricity can make improvements \nin  agriculture,  animal  breeding,  and  food  processing.  Microfinance  can  help  households  buy  machinery  for  wood \nprocessing, agriculture, small business, and construction. Electrification will provide better lighting, security, and comfort; \nand  increase  participation  of  household  members  in  evening  social  events  in  and  around  the  villages.  Local  public \nservices like education and health care facilities will potentially be improved through stable electricity provision.  \n\nA  household\u2019s  ability  to  benefit  from  electricity,  preparedness  for  electrification,  and  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity \ndepends  on  its  socioeconomic  condition.  Ethnic  minority  households  in  mountainous  areas  often  lack  motivation  for \nelectrification  and  are  not  willing  to  pay  for  its  use.  Pricing  of  electricity  will  be  the  most  important  factor  for  poor \nhouseholds  to  connect  and  use  electricity.  Minimizing  the  cost  of  electricity  connection  to  poor  households  through  the \nProject might motivate poor households to electrify their houses. Electrification is an important infrastructure for improving \nliving  conditions;  however,  electricity  provision  needs  to  be  combined  with  other  development  efforts,  resources,  skill \ntraining, access to capital such as microfinance, irrigation facilities, provisions for agriculture, employment opportunities, \nroad  networks,  market  access,  and  access  to  basic  services  for  sustainable  improvement  of  the  living  conditions  of \nremote communities.  \n\nThe project activities for the mountainous communities include (i) motivational and awareness raising campaign on safe \nuse of electricity, conservation, and promotion of productive use of electricity; (ii) subsidized grid connection to all poor \nhouseholds; (iii) access to energy-efficient bulbs; (iv) support to microfinance access for poor households from the Social \nPoverty Bank and Women\u2019s Union for the subprojects; and (v) technical support to borrowers in utilizing the loans in an \nefficient  way.  In  the  communes,  a  community  management  board  (CMB)  will  be  formed  with  participation  of  commune \nleaders and representatives from the Women\u2019s Union, other mass organizations, village leaders, and women leaders to \nfacilitate implementation of these activities. An NGO will be recruited to build capacity of the CMB and to implement the \nactivities together with the CMB. The NGO will provide support to poor households in selecting activities and identifying \nmicrofinance  needs  for  these.  The  microfinance  program  will  be  targeted  to  the  communes  with  mini-hydro  plants  in \ncomponent 1 and concentration of ethnic minorities as part of the ethnic minority development plan. Although electricity \nwould lead to socioeconomic development of the remote communities, exposure of these remote communities  with the \noutside  world  can  also  increase  risks  of  HIV/AIDS,  sexually  transmitted  diseases  (STDs),  and  human  trafficking.  To \ncounter any risk of HIV/AIDS or STDs, a prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program is included in the Project. \nThe construction laborers, and women and men from the subprojects will be targeted for this program. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation  \n1. Stakeholders were consulted in the subproject locations in Lai Chau using a sample household survey; interviews with \nindividuals;  and  focus  group  meetings  with  key  stakeholders  from  different  categories  such  as  men  and  women,  from \ndifferent occupational groups  such as small  business owners, education  and healthcare  providers, local administration, \nand regional development authorities. A project consultation plan was prepared for the subprojects. Consultations have to \ninvolve  formal  commune  and  commune  leaders  and  traditional  ethnic  minority  leaders,  men  and  women  from  the \ncommunities, mass organizations, and relevant officials. \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nA Project C&P strategy was prepared to guide preparation of subproject specific C&P plans (Supplementary Appendix P). \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nThis  gender  analysis  is  limited  to  the  subproject  area  of  the  northern  mountainous  region.  In  the  mountainous  ethnic \nminority  communities,  women\u2019s  social  status  is  generally  lower  and  mobility  is  less  than  for  Kinh  women.  Lower \neducation,  remote  location,  and  lack  of  road  networks  have  resulted  in  ethnic  minority  women  having  few  contacts \noutside their own community. Women\u2019s  economic role  is related to subsistence agriculture, collecting  non-timber forest \nproducts,  and  animal  breeding.  Lack  of  electricity  for  pumping  water  and  irrigation  facilities  is  a  constraint  for  women\u2019s \nwork  in  agriculture.  Living  standards,  social  services,  and  income  generation  suffer  from  lack  of  roads,  transportation, \nelectricity,  and  employment  opportunities.  The  poorest  households  in  general  are  the  ones  relying  on  small-scale \nagriculture; they lack financial resources and capacity for broadening their income generation base. The most vulnerable \nhouseholds among these are those headed by women. Access to electricity and income-earning activities is an important \nfactor for their socioeconomic situation. Access to electricity might provide women with opportunities for small business, \ntrade,  and  agricultural  tools.  Mechanization  of  agricultural  tools  and  electric  appliances  might  lessen  their  drudgery.  If \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n63\n\nelectricity  is  provided  in  public  places  through  street  lighting,  this  will  contribute  to  women\u2019s  security,  mobility,  and \nparticipation in different social events in the evening. \n \nElectricity  will  improve  health  care  services  and  maternal  care  for  women.  Refrigeration  supports  better  access  to  and \nquality of medicines, vaccines, and blood bank products, which potentially improve health security for women, men, and \nchildren.  This  development,  however,  is  dependent  on  public  sector  investment  and  human  resource  capacity.  Project \nconstruction for the mini-hydro component will bring outside male workers to local areas, possibly from different cultural \nenvironments and with different cultural habits. The presence of workers may potentially increase the risk for women and \ngirls  to  be  exposed  to  STDs  and  HIV/AIDS.  Electrification  may  also  increase  the  number  of  restaurants,  karaoke  bars, \nand nighttime activities. In some subproject areas, electrification will, in the long run, open up for development of tourism, \nthis can pose potential risk of sexual exploitation of women and girls.  \n2.  Key Actions \n\n Gender plan    \n\n Other actions/measures   \n \n\n No action/measure \n\nThe Project\u2019s gender strategy is related to the following project activities: (i) CMB, (ii) awareness campaign on safe use of \nelectricity  and  conservation;  (iii)  productive  use  of  electricity  through  microfinance;  (iv)  HIV/AIDS,  STDs,  and  human \ntrafficking program; and (v) resettlement. However, the gender strategy in component 2 (network expansion) is limited to \nan  awareness  campaign  on  safe  use  of  electricity  and  conservation;  and  an  HIV/AIDS,  STDs,  and  human  trafficking \nprogram.

The framework will \nbe updated after the impact \nassessment is completed for \nthe subprojects of central and \nsouthern provinces. \nThe construction contracts will \ninclude provision of fair wages, \nequal wages for men and \nwomen for equal work, and \nbasic facilities in the \nconstruction camp. \nThe main affordability issue is \nthe poor household\u2019s ability to \npay for the initial connection \ncost and house wiring as this \nmay cost up to $200 per \nhousehold. (i.e., equal to 20%\u2013\n25% of average annual \nhousehold income). Hence, \npoor households will be \nprovided subsidized \nconnections at $40. The \nmonthly electricity bills are \nexpected to range from $1 to \n$2, this amount is less than the \nexpenditure on kerosene.  \nAwareness campaign for \npreventing HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking is prepared.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n  Full Plan \n  Short Plan \n  Resettlement Framework \n  No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  Indigenous Peoples \nFramework \n  No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n  No Action \n\n  Action Included in the \nProject Component \n  No Action \n\n Plan \n Other Action  \n  No Action \n\nLimited impact \n\nand/or \n\nOther  Risks \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict,  political \ninstability,  etc),  please \nspecify \n\nIV.
