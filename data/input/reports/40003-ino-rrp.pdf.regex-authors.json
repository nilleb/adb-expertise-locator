Significant disparities exist in achievements across regions and \nincome  groups.  While  solid  progress  is  noted  in  many  areas, \naccelerated improvements are needed to meet the international and \nnational  MDG  targets.  Poverty  levels  increased  in  2006,  reversing \nprevious gains, with almost 40 million (17.7%) poor, and 49% of the \npopulation living on less than $2 a day. This is far from the MDG target \nof reducing the proportion of people below the poverty line to 7.6% of \nthe population by 2015. Progress toward some of the health-related \ntargets  is  particularly  off-track.  Maternal  mortality  rates  remain \nstubbornly high, malnutrition and child mortality rates are higher than in \nmany  neighboring  countries,  and  about  582,000  new  cases  of \ntuberculosis are recorded every year. The infant mortality rate is three \ntimes higher for the poorest 20% of the population than for the richest \n20%,  and  about  half  of  the  children  from  the  poorest  quintile  of \nhouseholds do not enroll in junior secondary school. The poor suffer \ndisproportionately from a lack of access to quality education and health \nservices and have lower health and education outcomes.  \nThe Government has gradually increased social sector expenditures to \nmeet its ambitious poverty reduction and MDG-related targets. Several \ncritical  measures  were  initiated  to  expand  and  reorient  public \nexpenditures towards the education and health sectors, improve the \nefficiency of health services for the poor, and expand access, equity \nand  quality  of  basic  education.  A  significant  portion  of  the  savings \ngenerated  by  removal  of  the  fuel  subsidy  was  utilized  to  mitigate \nimpacts on the poor through the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation \nProgram  (PKPS-BBM)  launched  in  2005.  The  PKPS-BBM  Program \nprovided  unconditional  cash  transfers  to  the  poor,  operational ", "ii\nassistance to schools (BOS), and a basic healthcare and insurance \nprogram (ASKESKIN) for the poor and quasi-poor. The Government \nhas also initiated critical policy actions to expand and improve social \nsector delivery at the decentralized district level.  \nThe proposed PRMAP fits within the context of Indonesia entering into \na  second  generation  of  fiscal  reforms  and  reorientation  of  fiscal \nresources to accelerate attainment of the MDGs and achievement of its \npoverty reduction and social development goals. The proposed PRMAP \nhas thus been designed to recognize and support government reform \nefforts  to  develop  and  implement  MDG-related  policy  actions,  while \nestablishing  a  flexible  policy  framework  to  deepen  and  expand  the \nreforms in the medium term. The policy dialogue has resulted in the \ndesign and development of the PRMAP as a program cluster of three \nconsecutive  subprograms,  each  of  them  supported  with  a  single \ntranche loan release. \nImpact and  Impacts  and  outcome.  The  PRMAP  impacts  will  be  to  accelerate \nOutcome progress  towards  achieving  the  MDGs  (\u201cMDG  acceleration\u201d)  in \neducation (MDG 2), and health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and contribute to the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction (MDG 1) and gender equality (MDG 3) \nagenda.  The  program\u2019s  outcome  is  improved  access,  equity,  and \nquality  of  service  delivery  in  the  education  and  health  sectors  to \naccelerate  progress  toward  the  MDGs.  It  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with national priorities as reflected in the current medium \nterm development plan. The program will assist the Government in the \nongoing re-orientation of fiscal expenditures to the social sectors and \nthe reduction of regional disparities. PRMAP will include three main \npillars with the following policy outputs: \n(i) Cross-sectoral reforms. The PRMAP support will result in: (a) an \nincreased budget allocation for health and education, especially focused \non  MDG-related  programs;  (b)  improved  performance  incentives  and \ngeographical resource allocation to districts for education and health; (c) \na uniform system for targeting the poor to achieve health and education-\nrelated MDGs; (d) gender equity in health and education services; and \n(e) a planning framework for MDG acceleration. \n(ii) Policy reforms in the education sector for MDG acceleration.\nThe  PRMAP  will  lead  to:  (a)  improved  access  to  junior  secondary \nschools  in  under-served  areas,  (b)  improved  operations  and \nmaintenance (O&M) support for smaller/remote schools, (c) increased \naffordability of education by poor students/households, (d) enhanced \nquality and equitable deployment of teachers, (e) education service \ndelivery that meets minimum service standards (MSSs), (f) improved \nplanning  and  implementation  of  education  services,  and  (g)  greater \ntransparency of education outcomes to enhance accountability. \n(iii)  Policy  reforms  in  the  health  sector  for  MDG  acceleration. \nProgram support will result in (a) increased public financing of MDG-\nrelated  health  programs,  (b) better  targeting  of  public  financing  for \nhealth services for the poor, (c) improved effectiveness of maternal ", "iii\nneonatal and child health (MNCH) care and reproductive health (RH) \nservice  delivery  through  influencing  provider  behavior,  (d)  improved \neffectiveness  of  communicable  disease  control  (CDC)  through \nintegrated  programs,  (e)  improved  performance  and  monitoring  for \nhealth-related MDGs, and (f) improved financial information with regard \nto MDG-related health expenditures. \nCost Estimates and  Indonesia faces large financing requirements to support its ambitious \nFinancing Plan  poverty reduction MDG agenda over the medium term. For Subprogram \n1 (SP1), the Government has requested that ADB provide a loan of \n$400 million. For subsequent Subprograms, the Government envisages \nsupport from ADB of $200 million each.  \nProgram Loan  The SP1 loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nAmount and Terms  have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum; conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with \nthe draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion \nguidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nprogram loan agreement.\nProgram Period and  SP1 has been implemented from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007. All \nTranching actions included in the policy matrix under SP1 have been taken during \nthese 2 years. The program period for Subprogram 2 (SP2) is from 1 \nApril  2007  to  31  March  2009  and  Subprogram  3  (SP3)  will  be \nimplemented from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011. The loans supporting \nthe subprograms of PRMAP will be disbursed in a single tranche upon \ndeclaration of loan effectiveness. \nExecuting Agency  National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)\nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures for program \nloans,1  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower.  No \nsupporting  import  documentation  will  be  required  if  the  value  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan disbursed \nduring the given year. The Government will certify its compliance with \nthis  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \nTechnical The proposed TA supports the strengthening of social service delivery \nAssistance through  the  implementation  of  national  policy  reforms  in  health  and \n                                                \n1 ADB. 1998.

It will support the Government\u2019s efforts to sustain the reforms \nintroduced under SP1 and to refine and achieve the policy reforms under \nSP2. The TA includes three components: (i) cross-sectoral policy reforms, \n(ii) reforms in the education sector, and (iii) reforms in the health sector. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,700,000, of which $1,500,000 \nwill be provided as a grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund, $1,000,000 will be cofinanced on a parallel basis by grants from \nthe Australian Agency for International Development, and the rest by \nthe Government. \nProgram Benefits  The key benefits expected from PRMAP are (i) the acceleration of the \nand Beneficiaries  MDGs and sustained progress in meeting the medium-term poverty \nreduction and social development objectives, (ii) ongoing re-orientation \nof public expenditure to the social sectors, (iii) reduction of regional \ndisparities,  and  (iv)  increased  access  to  better  quality  and  more \naccountable education and health services.  \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  will  mainly  be  the  poor  and  women  and \nchildren  who  lack  access  to  quality  education  and  health  services. \nImproved access and equity of social services will contribute to reducing \nsharp regional and socioeconomic differences; reducing maternal and \ninfant and child mortality rates; and improving control of communicable \ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Better physical \naccess to schools, the removal of fees, and enhanced quality is likely to \nresult in improved participation and transition rates to junior secondary \neducation.  \nAccelerating  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  will \ndirectly benefit women. The policy measures will lead to improvements \nin  (i)  girls  access  to  junior  secondary  education  through  integrated \nschools  and  scholarship  schemes,  and  (ii)  women\u2019s  access  to \naffordable maternal and reproductive health services through increased \nfinancing and technical improvements to the ASKESKIN program.  \nImproved access to basic education will increase productivity and personal \nincome  of  poor  families  in  the  long  run.  Access  to  affordable  health \nservices and to health insurance will increase productivity and protect the \npoor from catastrophic health risks, which can plunge them into deeper \npoverty.  The  PRMAP  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  human \nresources  to  better  equip  the  population  to  take  advantage  of  the \nopportunities generated by economic growth. It will also have a positive \nimpact on employment by increasing the number of healthcare providers \n(e.g., midwives) and improving recruitment and deployment of teachers.  \nRisks and  The PRMAP is subject to the following risks: \nAssumptions\n(i) Limited impact on education and health outcomes. Increased \ncentral government budget allocations for education and health \nmay encourage local governments to reduce their own allocations. \nThe  introduction  of  performance-based  allocation  mechanisms \nand improved systems for monitoring outcomes will mitigate these \nrisks.", "v\n(ii) Corruption and poor governance. PRMAP may face constraints \nin the form of weak governance and corruption. However, the \nGovernment  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anti-corruption \nefforts over recent years.\n(iii)  Resistance to the policy reforms by local governments. Lack\nof clarity about the reform-related roles and obligations of local \ngovernment involved in social services delivery, combined with a \nlack of capacity could pose obstacles for reform implementation. \nThere is also a risk that local governments do not support reforms \nthat increase accountability and impose further monitoring of their \npolicies  and  actions.  Recent  steps  taken  to  clarify  roles  and \nresponsibilities  through  development  of  minimum  services \nstandards,  and  current  support  provided  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  a  number  of  districts  for  capacity \ndevelopment, are expected to reduce these risks.  \n(iv)  External and domestic economic shocks. Increased oil prices \nor  other  adverse  regional  or  domestic  events  that  have  a \ncontagion effect could reduce the fiscal space available for reform \nimplementation.  To  date,  Government  efforts  to  balance  the \nbudget and improve economic management have reduced this \nrisk.\n(v)  Government commitment to the MDGs. A lack of government \ncommitment  could  reduce  the  momentum  for  policy  reforms \nfocused  on  accelerated  achievement  of  the  MDGs.  However, \nGovernment actions indicate strong commitment to the poverty \nreduction and MDG acceleration agenda in the medium term.  ", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development  Goals  Acceleration \nProgram (PRMAP) to the Government of Indonesia, comprising (i) a first subprogram and a \nproposed two subsequent subprograms, (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1 of the PRMAP,1\nand (iii) proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Social Services Delivery. \nII.  THE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Over  the  past  2  years,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  (the  Government)  has  made \nimpressive progress in macroeconomic management, and succeeded in returning the economy \nto an economic growth path. During this period the Government consolidated gains made over \nthe past few years and instituted wide-ranging structural reforms in various sectors to remove \ndistortions that led to the 1997 financial crisis. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rose \nfrom the post-crisis level of 0.8% (in 1998) to 2\u20133% during 2000\u20132002, and reached 5.5% in \n2006. Fiscal consolidation has been the central feature of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic \nmanagement. Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Government\u2019s principal focus has \nbeen on recouping the massive cost of financial sector restructuring, estimated at upwards of \n$75 billion, or over a third of Indonesia\u2019s annual GDP.  \n3.  Economic  vulnerability  to  external  shocks  has  been  decreasing  due  to  sound  debt \nmanagement. The central government budget deficit has been reduced from 2.8% to 0.9% of \nGDP over the 2000\u20132006 period, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 90% \nto 39.6% over the same period, heading towards the target of 30% by 2010. In 2006, Indonesia \nprepaid $7.6 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Foreign exchange reserves, \nsupported by returning capital inflows, rose sharply in 2006, from $24.7 billion to $42.6 billion. \nThe ratio of total external debt to GDP fell from 46.7% in 2005 to 34.0% in 2006. However, there \nare still some debt concerns, due to the fact that around 20% of all tax revenue is needed to pay \npublic debt services. Increased public spending will lead to a rise in the budget deficit from the \ninitial estimate of 0.9% to 1.6% of GDP for 2007. The Jakarta floods in 2007, mudflows in East \nJava, earthquake damage in East Sumatra and rice purchases for buffer stocks to stabilize \nprices will contribute to this increase.  \n4.  In 2005, the Government addressed one of the most critical distortions by increasing \ndomestic fuel-oil prices by 29% in March and subsequently by 126% in October. This move \nsaved about $5 billion in 2005 and $10 billion in 2006 that would otherwise have been spent on \nunproductive fuel subsidies, which were largely regressive and benefited mainly the middle \nclasses. Due to fuel price increases, inflation accelerated to over 18% in October 2005. The \ncentral bank raised interest rates from 8% to 9.75% between October 2005 to December 2006 \nto counter the upward pressure on prices. High interest rates and inflation have had negative \nconsequences on the poor and near-poor. In September 2006, the Central Board of Statistics \n(BPS) reported an increase from 16.0% to 17.7% in the poverty head count index between \nFebruary 2005 and March 2006.\n5.  While the Government has largely managed to attain its goal of fiscal prudence, in the \npast it has not been able to maintain its development expenditures\u2014particularly on education \nand health\u2014at the scale needed to accelerate economic growth, poverty reduction and social \ndevelopment in parity with its regional neighbors. From 1985 to 2001, health sector funding \naveraged less than 3% of total public expenditure and about 0.5% of GDP, which is much lower \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2\nthan  the  average  for  ASEAN  countries  of  2.5%  of  GDP.  In  2001,  public  expenditure  on \neducation was only 2.4% of GDP, one of the lowest rates among similar countries in the region. \nThe past low level of financing has constrained delivery of the quality basic social services \nrequired to meet the economy\u2019s human capital development needs.  \n6.  Mindful  of  the  need  to  transform  economic  growth  into  sustainable  broad-based \ndevelopment, the Government has been gradually increasing public expenditures for the social \nsectors  and  providing  additional  funds  to  local  governments  for  health  and  education.  The \nGovernment has acknowledged that increases in overall social sector expenditures are required if \nits ambitious targets relating to poverty reduction and accelerated achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) are to be achieved. The 2007 Indonesia Public \nExpenditure Review (PER)2 showed that total public education and health expenditures increased \nsignificantly from 2001 to 2006. During this period, education expenditures increased from 11.4% \nto 17.2% of overall national expenditure, while health expenditures rose from 2.6% to 4.5%; \nmeasured as a share of GDP, education expenditures rose from 2.4% to 3.6%, and health \nexpenditures  from  0.55%  to  0.95%.  Despite  significant  increases,  Indonesia  still  spends \nsignificantly less than its neighbors on education and health. Annual expenditures on the order of \n4% of GDP in both the health and education sectors are required to achieve basic improvements \nin human development and achievement of the MDGs.  \n7.  Debt management and steady economic growth combined with the creation of additional \nfiscal space  has  provided  the confidence to increase  public expenditures for tackling  poverty \nreduction and investing in health and education. A significant portion of the savings generated by \nremoval of the fuel subsidy was utilized to mitigate the impacts of the fuel price increases on the \npoor. In 2005, the Government launched a Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-\nBBM) focused on the poor. This released funds for pro-poor social expenditures. The PKPS-BBM \nincluded four different sub-programs: (i) unconditional cash transfers to the poor, (ii) operational \nassistance to schools (bantuan operational sekolah, [BOS]), (iii) basic health care and health \ninsurance (ASKESKIN program) for the poor and quasi-poor, and (iv) a rural infrastructure program. \n8.  While increased investments in the social sectors are critical, the Government has been \nacutely  aware  of  other  constraints  that  impede  efficient  public  expenditure  management, \nincluding (i) limited capacity at the district level to design and deliver education and health \nexpenditure programs, resulting from the rapid pace at which decentralization reforms were \nintroduced; and (ii) political and regional autonomy considerations, which had to be balanced \nwith the devolution of resources and responsibilities for education and health service delivery to \nthe districts to ensure that national policy objectives, such as the attainment of the MDGs, are \nachieved. Fundamental challenges have emerged in relation to the lack of clarity on functional \nassignments,  financial  management,  accountability,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nefficiency of public social expenditure programs. In light of these constraints, the Government, \nwith the support of ADB and other development partners, has adopted comprehensive reforms \nto strengthen the overall policy, legal and regulatory framework relating to local government \nfinance.\n9. In 2005, the Government requested that ADB provide a program loan to support its \npoverty reduction and social development objectives over the medium term. The program would \nbe designed to support the education and health reform agenda and improve the effectiveness \nof  public  expenditure  programs  targeted  at  accelerating  achievement  of  the  health-  and \neducation-related MDGs. Since early 2005, ADB has been engaged in an MDG-related policy \n                                                \n2  World Bank, BAPPENAS, and MOF. 2007. Indonesia Spending for Development: Public Expenditure Review. \nWashington, DC. ", "3\ndialogue with the Government and other relevant development partners. ADB has prepared \nassessments of the education and health sectors, identified constraints, and discussed key \nsector issues and related medium-term reforms for the attainment of the MDGs with relevant \nministries. Policy dialogue was conducted through several consultations; pre-fact-finding, fact-\nfinding, and appraisal missions; and ongoing policy dialogue by Indonesia Resident Mission and \nADB teams working on health and education projects. During this period, the Government has \ntaken initial critical steps and instituted a range of policy actions to set the pace for reforms \naimed at accelerating achievement of the MDGs. The Government requested that ADB work \ntowards a medium-term commitment of resources to support the MDG acceleration program, \nwith particular attention to the health and education sectors.  \n10. Indonesia is entering into a second generation of fiscal reforms and reorientation of fiscal \nresources, aimed at achievement of the MDGs within a stable macroeconomic framework, and \nthe  proposed  PRMAP  fits  within  this  context,  which  is  characterized by  the  Government\u2019s \nobjectives of: (i) enhancing the quantity and quality of social public expenditures; (ii) improving \nlocal government accountability without stifling basic regional autonomy principles; and (iii) \nadopting sound and sustainable resource allocation mechanisms to target poverty reduction and \nMDG  acceleration,  especially  in  lagging  areas.  Viewed  within  the  above  macroeconomic \ncontext,  Indonesia  is  emerging  as  a  middle-income  country  that  seeks  flexible  financing \narrangements to support its development objectives. As a result, the proposed PRMAP has \nbeen designed to recognize and support Government reform efforts to develop and implement \npolicy actions leading to MDG acceleration, while establishing a flexible policy framework to \ndeepen and expand the reforms in the medium term. The policy dialogue has resulted in the \ndesign and development of the PRMAP as a program cluster of three consecutive subprograms \n(SP), each supported with a single tranche loan release. Subject to satisfactory progress, the \nthree subprograms will be phased at intervals of about 2 years. \nIII.  THE SECTORS \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n11.  At the Millennium Summit in September 2000, the Government committed to meeting \nthe  MDGs  by  2015,  and  the  Government  reiterated  this  commitment  and  presented  the \ncountry\u2019s 2005 MDG progress report3 at the UN General Assembly in September 2005. The \nPresident of Indonesia renewed and reinforced Indonesia\u2019s commitment to the MDGs during the \nstate address for the presentation of the 2007 budget. Special attention was given to issues of \npoverty, education and health. The Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan for 2005\u2013\n2009 (RPJM) and its National Poverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK), are characterized by a \nstrong focus on policies and programs for social justice, equity and quality of basic social \nservices, especially health and education. \n12.  The RPJM, which presents the Government medium-term vision, lays out an ambitious \npoverty reduction and social development agenda. The RPJM identifies the advancement of the \nwelfare of the people as one its three pillars and includes targets for poverty reduction at the \nnational level, reduction of inter-regional differences, and improvement of human capital through \nincreased access to and quality of education and health services. The RPJM sets social targets \nfor 2009, some of which are more ambitious than the MDGs, including: (i) halving the 2004 \nnational poverty rate (from 16.6% to 8.2%); (ii) providing 9 years of compulsory, quality basic \neducation; (iii) reducing illiteracy to 5%; (iv) reducing child mortality to 26 per 1,000 live births; \nand (v) achieving a decline in maternal mortality to 226 per 100,000 live births. It is recognized \n                                                \n3  The 2007 MDG report for Indonesia is under preparation. ", "4\nthat a major expansion of the budget allocation for social services is required to increase service \ncoverage and improve quality, particularly for health services (there is a constitutional obligation \nto allocate 20% of the total Government budget for education services).4\n13.  The MDGs form an overarching framework that places basic human rights and poverty \nat the center of the development agenda. Indonesia\u2019s progress towards meeting the MDG \ntargets has been mixed. While the country has made good progress overall, progress toward \nseveral targets is slow. Despite the Government\u2019s efforts, vast differences exist across regions \nand districts and between rural and urban areas, as well as between income groups; there are \nalso some persistent gender disparities. A recent study to assess MDG progress in Asia and the \nPacific classified Indonesia as one of the countries of greatest concern, both with respect to the \nlevel of deprivation and the level of progress towards the MDGs.5 Indonesia\u2019s performance and \nprogress on the MDGs is provided below.6 A summary of key indicators measuring progress \ntoward the MDGs and targets is presented in Appendix 2. \n14. Eradicating Extreme Poverty (MDG 1). Significant progress has been achieved in \nreducing income poverty. Despite the setback of the Asian financial crisis, income poverty \ndeclined steadily from the 1999 level of 23.4% to 16% in February 2005, comparable to pre-\ncrisis levels. However, by March 2006, an additional 4 million people fell into poverty, largely \ndue to the removal of fuel subsidies and increases in the price of rice, resulting in a poverty \nincidence  of  about  17.7%;  this  is  far  from  the  MDG  target  of  7.6%  by  2015,7  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s target of 8.2% by 2009. This level of poverty incidence translates to almost 40 \nmillion poor people, with many more (about 49% of the population) living on less than $2 a day, \nand vast regional differences. While four provinces have less than 10% of their population under \nthe poverty line (with Jakarta at 3.4%), at least 14 provinces have poverty levels of more than \n20% (with Papua at about 50%).  \n15. Achieving Universal Basic Education (MDG 2). Indonesia\u2019s performance relative to \nthe education-related MDG has been mixed. It has made good progress towards meeting some \nof the intermediate targets at the national level, however regional disparities are still significant. \nThe Government is aiming beyond the standard MDG 2, as it has included both primary (1 to 6) \nand junior secondary (7 to 9) education levels in its universal basic education target. While the \nprimary school gross enrolment rate (GER) achieved universal coverage by the early 1980s, \nand stayed high despite the financial crisis of the late 1990s, the net enrolment rate (NER) has \nmade only small steady increases (from 91.5% in 1995 to 94.0% in 2005). The GER for junior \nsecondary rose from 65.7% in 1995 to 85.2% in 2005, while the NER rose from 51% in 1995 to \n63.7% in 2005.8 The Government target is to raise the GER in junior secondary education to \n95% by 2008.\n16. Despite the impressive GERs and NERs, disparities in access to education continue to \nexist (i) within provinces, (ii) between rural and urban areas, and (iii) between the rich and poor. \nThe NER for junior secondary school in 2006 ranged from 43.3% in Nusa Tenggara Timur \n(NTT) to 77.4% in D.I Yogyakarta, although these have been narrowing over the last decade. \n                                                \n4  Amended 1945 Constitution (Amendment 4, 2002) Article 31. \n5  ADB, UNDP, UNESCAP. 2006. The Millennium Development Goals: Progress in Asia and the Pacific 2006.\nManila.  \n6  The analysis does not include MDGs 7 and 8, which are not supported by PRMAP. \n7  Poverty incidence in 1990, using the national poverty line, was 15.1%. In order to reach the MDG target of halving \npoverty between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people below the poverty line should be 7.6% by 2015.  \n8  Differences in the GER and NER indicate that the school system is catering to underage and over age children \nwithin the school population, indicating system inefficiencies. Similarly, gains in NERs have begun to stagnate \nindicating access barriers and constraints. While the NER is a good measure of entry into school, one of its key \nlimitations is that it does not capture the level of school attendance or completion.", "5\nWhile the gap in the NER at the primary level between the rich and poor is very small, this \nwidens at the junior secondary level. In 2002, only 45.5% of children from the poorest income \nquintile enrolled in junior secondary education, compared with 76.9% of children from the richest \nquintile, indicating that access constraints to education are significantly poverty-related. \n17. Furthermore, not all Indonesian children enrolled in school complete basic education \nwithin the required 9 years. Around 686,000 children drop out of primary school annually, and \nchildren who fail to complete primary education are especially at risk of becoming illiterate \nadults. In 2004/2005, the primary to junior secondary transition rate stood at 82.6%, with 17.4% \nof students who completed primary education not continuing on to junior secondary. Despite \nsteady achievements in increasing school enrolment, Indonesia\u2019s national average educational \nattainment is low compared to neighboring countries. In 2003, Indonesians aged 15 years and \nabove had an average of 7.44 years of schooling; only 36.2% had an education equal to or \nabove the junior secondary level. \n18.  Promoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women (MDG 3). Indonesia is on track \nto eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2015. The gender gap in \nterms of the NER at the national level has been eliminated at the primary level, and reversed for \nthe junior secondary level. At the senior secondary level in 2003, the female NER of 37.7% \nlagged slightly behind the male rate of 38.8%. While the gender gap in adult literacy rates has \nbeen narrowing steadily, the literacy rate of women (86%) is still lower than that of men (94%). \nWomen have a mean of 6.5 years of schooling, while the mean for men is 7.6 years.9\n19. Reducing Child Mortality (MDG 4). Indonesia is currently on track to achieve the MDG \ntarget of reducing the under-5 mortality rate by two thirds between 1990 and 2015. Between \n1990 and 2004 under-5 mortality decreased from 97 per 1,000 live births to 38, which is still \nhigher than similar countries in the region, but close to the MDG target of 32.3. There are still \nsharp regional and socioeconomic differences in child mortality rates, however, ranging from 23 \ndeaths per 1,000 births in Yogyakarta to 103 in West Nusa Tenggara. The differences between \nthe rich and poor in the under-5 mortality rate are still some of the sharpest observed in Asia, \nwith about 20 deaths per 1000 births among the richest quintile, compared with 75 deaths \namong the poorest quintile. \n20. Improve Maternal Health (MDG 5). Although considerable progress has been made \ntoward achieving the target of reducing by three fourths the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), \nprogress to date has not been sufficiently rapid to indicate achievement of this target. The \nestimated MMR has declined from 390 to 307 per 100,000 live births between 1994 and 2002, \nwhich is very far from the 2015 MDG target of 102. During the period 1992 to 2002, the \nproportion of births assisted by skilled health personnel (an important MDG 5 intermediate \nindicator) has increased from 40.7% to 72.0%, but is still far from the government target of 90% \nby 2010. Sharp socioeconomic differences remain, with only 48% of poor women delivering with \na trained provider, compared with 90% of wealthy women; regional disparities are also marked, \nwith just 35% of women delivering with a trained provider in NTT, compared with 96% in \nJakarta.\n21. Combat HIVAIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases (MDG 6). Indonesia is not on track to \nachieve the MDG targets for HIV/AIDS and malaria, although is on track for tuberculosis (TB). \nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is concentrated in a few high-prevalence groups (i.e., commercial sex \nworkers and injecting drug users). It is estimated that about 193,000 Indonesians lived with \nHIV/AIDS and about 5,500 died of AIDS in 2006, while about 18,000 are orphans due to the \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2006. Indonesia: Country Gender Assessment. Manila. ", "6\ndisease. The incidence of condom use with high-risk partners is still low, while comprehensive \ncorrect knowledge about HIV/AIDS is still limited to the better educated.  \n22.  Nearly one-half of Indonesia\u2019s population lives in malaria-endemic areas, and about 30 \nmillion cases are expected to occur every year. Although bed net coverage is reasonably high, \nuse of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying are still limited. Unless funding for \nmalaria control is increased significantly in the future, it is unlikely that malaria incidence will \nhave begun to decrease by 2015. Indonesia\u2019s estimated TB prevalence rate remains high, at \n125  per  100,000  people.  Although  the  directly  observed  treatment\u2014short  course  (DOTS) \ntreatment success rate has increased sharply during the past few years, reaching 57% in 2005, \nit is still far from the Government target of 85%. \nB.  Issues and Opportunities10\n1.  Issues \na.  Cross-Sectoral Issues \n23.  The MDGs will not be achieved unless the poor have better access to, and utilize, \naffordable and good quality health and education services. Policies and programs are needed \nthat: (i) increase and better target budgetary allocations for health and education services at the \ndistrict level; (ii) improve the quality and efficiency of these services; (iii) improve public sector \ngovernance; (iv) monitor and evaluate outcomes; and (v) develop efficient and transparent \naccountability  mechanisms  between  national  and  regional  governments,  service  providers, \nusers and communities to improve performance.  \n24.  Decentralization has posed considerable challenges to the delivery of education and \nhealth services, resulting in significant differences in outcomes and performance across local \ngovernments.  Basic  education  and  health  services  are  obligatory  functions  of  the  district \ngovernment.11 However, the central government still has a key role in the allocation of resources \nand  the  development  of  policies,  legislation  and  guidelines.  In  principle,  the  switch  to  a \ndecentralized system for the provision of social services should positively affect access, equity \nand effectiveness of service delivery. However, devolving the responsibility for education and \nhealth care to the districts has reduced the Government\u2019s capacity to implement and monitor its \nnational policy objectives, including the achievement of the MDGs. Disparities among districts in \ncapacity and per-capita health and education expenditure has led to critical gaps in access and \nquality of service provision in some districts. Improvements in the mechanisms for allocating \nfunds to the provinces and districts are required to (i) better target poorly performing districts \nthat  need  additional  assistance  (so-called  \u201cMDG-deficit  districts\u201d);  and  (ii)  encourage  local \ngovernments to improve performance in the health and education sectors, so as to achieve the \nMDGs.  \n25. Need to Improve Fund Allocation for MDG-Deficit Districts. Local governments have \nbeen granted substantial fiscal autonomy through the introduction of an intergovernmental fiscal \ntransfer system that includes elements of revenue sharing, a general development fund (Dana \nAlokasi Umum, or DAU),12 and a special development fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK). \n                                                \n10 Appendix 3 includes a summary sector analysis for the health and education sectors, and Supplementary \nAppendices A and B include detailed analyses. \n11Law 32 of 2004 gives provincial governors responsibility for assessing district budgets to ensure that districts \ncomply with their obligatory functions. However, the districts retain the main responsibility for the provision of \neducation and health services. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) is preparing, in 2007, a new government \nregulation that will further clarify the roles and responsibilities of each level of government. \n12DAU represents about 80% of local government revenues and is largely allocated for salaries of health and \neducation staff devolved to the districts. The Government is discussing different options for the reform of the DAU ", "7\nAlthough these mechanisms are meant to assist local governments without sufficient resources \nof their own, the current distribution criteria do not allow a focus on the poorest districts, or those \nnot on track to achieve the MDGs. For example, the DAK allocation for education is not linked to \nenrolment rates in primary or junior secondary schools, and the DAK allocation for health is not \nrelated to the use of skilled health personnel.  \n26. Uneven Performance by Districts in the Delivery of Health and Education Services.\nThe PER estimated that 70% of education and health expenditures are made at the sub-\nnational level, mostly by district governments.13 In most districts the majority of the budget for \nthese sectors is allocated for salary and benefits, and the percentage allocated to development \nexpenditures and other recurrent activities, including maintenance and operations, has been \nhistorically very small. Furthermore, there are significant disparities between districts in the per \ncapita public expenditures for health and education,14 which translate into inequalities in service \nprovision across districts. Many districts need to improve their planning and budgeting systems, \nfiduciary  controls,  and  education  and  health  expenditure  monitoring  to  make  them  more \nefficient, transparent and better targeted to the poor. An increased resource allocation to the \nsocial  sectors  is  required  to  improve  health  and  education  outcomes  and  performance, \nparticularly by poor and MDG-deficit districts. Current transfers from the Government to the \ndistricts are not linked to outcomes or performance.  \n27. The Reform of the DAK Offers an Opportunity to Provide Additional Resources to \ndistricts for MDG Programs and to Improve Performance. The purpose of the DAK is to (i) \naddress basic services that have not met certain standards, and (ii) support areas requiring \naccelerated  development.  DAK  allocations  are  earmarked  by  the  Government  to  specific \nsectors and districts. Each year, Parliament establishes the total DAK amount, with the overall \nlevel of DAK resources allocated to each of the sectors agreed upon by the (i) Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF),  (ii)  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  (iii)  National  Development  Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS), and (iv) the respective line ministries. Subsequently, the line ministries \nearmark these resources to specific uses in particular local governments within their sectors. \nFor FY2007, DAK allocations are broken down into seven different sectors, with education and \nhealth jointly representing more than 50% of the total DAK.15 The allocation of DAK resources \nfor health and education to specific districts is not linked to performance or progress on MDG \nachievement. There is also a high degree of unpredictability regarding the flow of funds, due to \nannual modifications of the allocation criteria, which distorts district-level plans and budgets. \nFurthermore, the DAK has remained basically undeveloped until recently, comprising a small \npercentage  of  all  central  government  transfers  to  districts,  and  of  all  capital  development \nresources. However, with the significant increases in DAK financing for 2005\u20132007, there are \nplans to introduce performance criteria for DAK allocations. The expansion and development of \nDAK into a more efficient mechanism for funding social sectors also offers an opportunity to \ndirect increased resources to MDG-deficit districts.  \n                                                \nin 2008 to transform it into a more efficient instrument to provide additional funds to the poorest districts. The Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform II program, currently under preparation by ADB, is expected to \nsupport the Government in these reforms. \n13In 2004, districts spent about 63% of the total national education budget and 49% of the total national health \nbudget, while the provinces spend about 6% and 18% respectively for education and health. \n14 There is a positive relationship between the level of district revenue and education and health expenditures, with \nhardly any variation in the share of district spending on health, at about 8%, and small variations for education, at \naround 33%. This translates into significant discrepancies in per capita allocations.  \n15Districts must provide matching funds of 10% equivalent of the central government contribution (except for the \npoorest districts) from their own local budgets; they receive quarterly payments after they have demonstrated that \nthey have spent the funds from the previous quarter. ", "8\n28. Lack of a Uniform System for Targeting the Poor. A good quality targeting system is \nfundamental  to  making  health  and  education  programs  for  the  poor  and  near-poor  more \nefficient, and requires accurate identification of the poor. Despite government efforts, a recent \nreview of the targeting performance of past programs16 revealed that only 12% of households in \nthe poorest quintile were covered by scholarship programs, while 22% had access to health \ncards. Similarly, only 40% of the benefits of scholarship programs went to the poorest quintile, \nand just 31% of the health cards were distributed to them. Both the BOS and ASKESKIN \nprograms have also identified the difficulty of accurately targeting the poor. The use by each \nprogram of different registries of the poor and different targeting criteria17 has significantly \ncontributed  to  this.  Developing  a  uniform  database  of  the  poor  and  effective  targeting \nmechanisms,  while  providing  some  allowance  for  local  flexibility,  is  crucial  for  delivery  of \neducation and health programs aimed to address gaps and disparities. \n29.  Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women is central to accelerating achievement \nof all the MDGs. Without direct improvements in women\u2019s health, education, access to formal \nemployment and decision-making, the MDGs are unlikely to be met. A recent household risk \nand vulnerability assessment18 shows that poor and near-poor households in Indonesia headed \nby females have higher maternal mortality, greater risk of experiencing health shocks, less \naccess to pre-natal care, lower levels of school attendance and a higher incidence of child labor. \nMDG  3  (promoting  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women)  and  MDG  5  (improving \nmaternal mortality) focus directly on women. MDG 2 (focusing on education), MDG 4 (relating to \nchild  mortality)  and  MDG  6  (on  communicable  disease  control  [CDC],  and  especially  the \nHIV/AIDS target), cannot be met without significant economic and social improvements in the \nlives of women and girls. The achievement of MDG 3 depends on the extent to which actions \ntaken to achieve all the other goals are designed to promote equality between men and women \nand girls and boys. In other words, the achievement of MDG 3 requires both direct actions and a \nfocus on the interdependence among all the goals. As a crosscutting theme, gender equality \nand women\u2019s empowerment needs to be integrated and mainstreamed across all MDG-related \npolicies, sectors and programs. Sex-disaggregated indicators are required for (i) measuring \nprogress and (ii) improved monitoring of both MDG 3 and the gender equity aspects of all the \nother goals. \n30. Female Illiteracy. About 12.8 million Indonesians (8.17% of the population) aged 15 \nyears and above are illiterate. Two-thirds are women from remote or isolated areas with limited \naccess to educational opportunities. In 2005, 12.5% of females aged 10 and above could not \nread and write, as compared with 5.7% of men. While gender parity in literacy rates has been \nachieved for those aged 15\u201324, improving the literacy levels of females, especially those of \nreproductive age, remains a challenge. Improved female literacy has implications for all the \nhealth and education-related MDGs. Literate mothers are more likely to access and utilize \neducation and health services for children. Literate females have fewer children and engage in \nbetter  birth-spacing  practices,  reducing  the  risk  of  maternal  mortality.  There  is  a  strong \ncorrelation between a mother\u2019s literacy level and the life expectancy of a child at birth.  \n31. Lack of a Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration. The lack of a comprehensive \nroadmap for accelerating achievement of the MDGs has made it difficult for the Government to \n                                                \n16 Social Safety Net Program for the Health Sector (JPSBK) and Scholarships (BKM) program for the education \nsector.\n17World Bank. 2006.

Targeting of \nscholarships was determined by school principals and school committees, while the health cards introduced in \n1998 were targeted by district health offices through community identification of the poor. \n18World Bank. 2006. Making the New Indonesia Work for the Poor. Washington, DC. ", "9\nmeasure and regularly and accurately report results relating to MDG targets and deficit districts. \nThe division of responsibilities among different government agencies has constrained analyses, \nand the design and implementation of policy actions to accelerate achievement of the MDGs. \nThe  failure  to  identify  appropriate  MDG-related  indicators  and  collect  accurate  data  are \nconstraints to the identification of MDG-deficit regions and districts and allocation of resources \nbased on needs and performance across sectors and regions. The lack of a comprehensive and \nregular  mechanism  for  the  compilation,  processing  and  analysis  of  MDG-related  data  has \ncontributed to gaps and weaknesses in the preparation of MDG reports. The central and local \ngovernments\u2019 lack of guidelines and knowledge regarding the implications of adopting MDG \ntargets has made it difficult to mainstream MDGs in the preparation of the annual and medium-\nterm plans and budgets of the ministries and districts, and in the poverty reduction strategies \nprepared by some regional governments. A comprehensive roadmap is needed to accelerate \nachievement of the MDGs by holistically addressing the challenges and identifying practical \nsolutions and priority sectors and areas. \nb.  Education Sector \n32. Unequal  Access  to  Basic  Education.  There  are  about  1.8  million  children  in  the \ncountry aged 13\u201315 who lack access to basic education. Achievement of the education-related \nMDG targets depends upon a steady increase in both net enrolment and completion rates at \nboth the primary and junior secondary levels. More critically, it depends upon increasing the \ntransition rate from primary to junior secondary schools. Key factors affecting net enrolment and \ntransition  rates  include  (i)  substantial  cost  barriers  (e.g.  fees,  transport  cost,  textbooks, \nstationary, and uniforms); (ii) uneven coverage of facilities within and between districts; and (iii) \nperceptions about the relevance of the curriculum and future employability of school graduates. \n33.  Poverty  is  a  major  barrier  to  completion  of  basic  education,  particularly  for  junior \nsecondary schools. Children from poor families either fail to enroll or drop out early, due to the \nphysical distance from educational facilities19 and cost of education, including uniforms, books, \nstationary and \u201cinformal\u201d fees. Financial contributions are still required, and can take creative \nforms, such as fines imposed on students, and regular requests for voluntary contributions and \n\u201cseat fees\u201d. In 2004, about 44% of the households in the poorest quintile who had children \nenrolled at the junior secondary level reported difficulties in financing schools fees; they paid \nabout  7%  of  total  household  expenditures  for  each  enrolled  student.  In  some  cases,  the \nopportunity  cost  of  school  attendance  is  too  high,  as  the  children  have  to  contribute  to \nhousehold income.\n34.  Significant disparities exist in the level of funding received by schools, and in spending \nper student across districts. In 2005, the Government increased the funding provisions for \nschool  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M),  through  the  establishment  of  BOS,  based  on \nstudent head counts for all schools. BOS is addressing some of these disparities, including \nindirectly reducing the need for parental contributions to school operating costs through informal \n\u201dfees\u201d. There are also infrastructure development needs, as the large number of primary schools \nbuilt in the 1970s need rehabilitation, while expansion and rehabilitation is also needed at the \njunior secondary level.20 Reducing urban-rural disparities within districts and income-related \ndisparities at the post primary level poses a significant challenge to achievement of the goal of \nuniversal basic education.  \n                                                \n19There are significant regional disparities in the average distance to junior secondary schools, which ranges from \n1.9 km in Java to 16.6 km in Papua. On average, transportation is an important cost for junior secondary students \nin the two poorest quintiles, and represents 17% of their total expenses for education; school fees account for 32% \nof education expenses. \n20A survey from MONE in 2004 concluded that 27.3% of the classrooms in secondary schools were damaged. ", "10\n35.  Adoption of the primary and junior secondary integrated school construction strategy \nconstitutes  an  effective  approach  to  reducing  current  access  barriers,  especially  those  of \ndistance to school and related costs. A clearly defined implementation plan, including targeting \nand eligibility criteria for integrated school construction, especially in under-served areas, is \ncritical if access policy targets are to be achieved. The introduction of the BOS also represents a \ncost-effective  strategy  for  indirectly  reducing  access-related  cost  barriers  and  maintaining \noperations.  However,  the  current  BOS  funding  levels  and  allocation  guidelines  are  not \nsufficiently robust. In the case of very poor families, BOS funding may be insufficient to sustain \ndemand  and  additional  scholarships  or  a  conditional  cash  transfer  (CCT)  scheme  will  be \nrequired.\n36.  Quality, Efficiency, and Effectiveness. While the country\u2019s education and training \nsystems are making adjustments to respond effectively to emerging demographic and labor \nmarket  demands,  Indonesia\u2019s  national  average  educational  attainment  is  low  compared  to \nneighboring countries. In 2006, pass rates in junior secondary examinations averaged 92% \n(ranging from 65% to 98%). Student examination performance varies widely across districts, \nwith  pass  rates  in  poorer,  rural  and  remote  areas  consistently  below  average.  Education \noutcomes,  as  measured  by  international  programs  that  assess  student  skills  and  learning \nachievement across countries, confirm the low quality of education.21\n37.  A  number  of  factors  contribute  to  low  and  uneven  quality  and  standards.  In  many \nschools and districts, public spending on education frequently covers only teacher salaries, with \nnon-personnel operational spending accounting for as little as 5%\u201310% of spending in many \ndistricts. Consequently, there are frequent shortages of funds for instructional materials, staff \ndevelopment  and  routine  maintenance  of  school  buildings.  Regional  differences  are \nexacerbated by the wide variation in provincial and district local revenues and expenditure \ncapacity, often resulting in wide variations in education standards between better and less well-\noff provinces and districts. \n38.  The  development  of  national  education  standards  and  progressive  application  of \nminimum service standards (MSSs) that define the \u201cquality and quantity\u201d of critical education \nservices, linked to clearly defined responsibilities at provincial, district and school levels, are \nrequired to improve the quality of basic education. Developing a small number of measurable \nand achievable MSSs on critical aspects such as teacher training and certification, school \nfacilities and learning materials can help anchor the Government\u2019s decentralized strategy to \nimprove access to and quality of education. The MSSs could also be used as a key criterion for \nbudget prioritization and allocation, and the indicators selected for this purpose should be \nclosely linked to the attainment of MDG 2. \n39. Another key constraint to quality improvement is the significant proportion of under-\nqualified teaching staff at all levels. In 2006, it was estimated that only 16.4% of primary school \nteachers and 59.1% of junior secondary teachers were qualified. Significant problems that need \nto be addressed to improve the quality of education services include (i) inequitable deployment \nof existing teachers within districts; (ii) teacher absenteeism (estimated at about 19%); and (iii) \nweak  expertise  of  teachers  in  priority  subject  areas,  such  as  math  and  science.  Special \nincentive programs need to be developed to attract teachers to remote areas. \n                                                \n21 In 2003, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Program for International \nStudent Assessment (PISA) revealed deficiencies in the standard of education among 12-year-olds and 15-year-\nolds, respectively.  ", "11\n40.  The challenge is to adopt and implement a systemic approach to addressing these \nconstraints. Strategic options to improve teacher recruitment, qualifications, and incentives for \ndeployment to rural schools, including madrasah, are currently being reviewed. Alternative \napproaches to expanding cost effective teacher upgrading systems are also being explored, \nwhile national standards and MSSs for priority standards are under preparation. While the \ndevelopment of MSSs provides an important basis for defining service standards, any definition \nof performance needs to make the link between service delivery and the quality of education \noutcomes at the district and school level. \n41. Governance,  Transparency,  and  Accountability.  Although  both  the  Ministry  of \nNational Education (MONE) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) are governed by the \nNational Education Law of 2003, each ministry has formulated separate education strategic \nplans22 with different financial strategies, due to their different roles under the decentralized \nadministration.  Better  alignment  of  these  plans,  strategies  and  operations  in  support  of \neducation service delivery at the district level is needed. Fragmentation of education planning \nand  financial  management  systems  has  created  a  number  of  constraints  for  districts  and \nschools. The current system of multiple financial allocations\u2014by MONE, MORA, provinces, and \ndistricts\u2014makes it difficult to capture all financial resources received by each school, and \ncomplicates the preparation by districts of local education plans and budgets, as the districts\u2019  \ntotal funding cannot be accurately predicted. Disparate policy objectives and priorities, financial \nmanagement systems, and reporting add to the confusion at the local level.  \n42.  To  balance  national  and  local  priorities,  mechanisms  for  coordination  of  local-level \nbudgeting, planning and allocation from multiple sources need to be improved, as does the \nreliability and predictability of central-local funding transfers; to enable multi-year planning, the \ncriteria for such transfers need to be made more transparent. At the institutional level, there are \ntremendous  opportunities  for  enhancement  of  service  delivery  through  organizational \nrestructuring and retraining at all levels of government, in accordance with the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policies  aimed  at  improving  the  planning,  financing  and  implementation  of \neducation  services.  While  the  role  of  MONE  as  a  policy-making,  standard-setting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation agency is now being articulated, the ministry has not transformed \nitself sufficiently to be effective in this new role.  \n43.  Increased  resource  allocation  for  the  education  sector  should  be  accompanied  by \nimproved governance, to ensure accountability in the use of these resources, and to reduce \ncorruption.  Greater  transparency  of  education  outcomes  is  required  to  increase  the \naccountability of schools and districts. At the community level, the role and effectiveness of \neducation boards and school committees as governance bodies distinct from management \nstructures  is  still  evolving.  Most  of  these  committees  in  MONE-managed  schools  meet \ninfrequently\u2014only about 20% meet at least once a month\u2014and women\u2019s participation is low. \nThe situation in madrasah is reportedly more encouraging, due to their longer tradition of \ncommunity participation in school affairs.  \nc.  Health Sector \n44. Limited Access to MNCH and CDC Health Services for the Poor and Women. \nIndonesia\u2019s  health  sector  has  been  under-funded  for  many  years,  resulting  in the  gradual \nerosion  of  the  public  health  system  as  a  provider  of  both  preventive  and  curative  health \nservices. Despite significant health budget increases in 2003 and 2004, Indonesia remains \n                                                \n22 MONE.2005.Medium Term Plan 2005\u20132009. Jakarta; and MORA. 2004. Madrasah Sector Assessment. Jakarta.", "12\nbehind other countries in the region with similar level of development.23 The central budget \nallocation to critical MDG-related MNCH and CDC services has been low, and a significant \nportion of health subsidies have not benefited the poor. De-concentrated expenditure provided \nby MOH to the regions, which in 2004 represented about 33% of total public health expenditure, \ndid  not  particularly  target  the  poor  or  MDG-deficit  districts.  Furthermore,  some  local \ngovernments, particularly those with weak fiscal capacity, allocate insufficient resources for \nimproving MNCH and CDC services. Limited health-sector spending has resulted in low health \nfacility density, insufficient funds for O&M, limited availability of drugs, and low retention of \npublic health staff.  \n45.  Public health services are underutilized, in particular by the poor and by women, due to: \n(i) the poor quality of care in government health facilities; (ii) the frequent absence of health \nstaff; (iii) limited availability of drugs and supplies; (iv) high direct and indirect service costs; and \n(v) the low density of government health facilities, which increases the distance traveled to \naccess care. Most infant deaths occur during the first month after birth, due mainly to poor \nmaternal health and nutrition, the poor quality of MNCH services, and the healthcare-seeking \nbehavior  of  pregnant  women  and  their  families.  Only  14%  of  mothers  practice  exclusive \nbreastfeeding during the first 6 months after birth. While immunization rates of 12 to 23 month-\nold children increased in 2004 to about 90%, immunization dropout rates tend to be high among \nchildren from poorer households. Limited use of health services for prenatal and postnatal care, \nfamily planning, and CDC (for diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB) affects progress \ntowards achieving the health-related MDGs.  \n46.  A significant reduction in maternal mortality24 requires a strategic focus on increasing the \npercentage of facility-based deliveries and births attended by skilled midwives, developing an \nefficient referral system, and increasing the use of contraceptives.25 Only 72% of births are \nattended by skilled personnel, compared with 99% in Thailand and 97% in Malaysia. Women \nthat deliver in health facilities have better access to emergency or referral care in case of \ncomplications. However, a majority of deliveries still occur in the home (about 60%). Access to \nhealth facilities or professionally trained health personnel varies between regions and across \nsocioeconomic groups. Average distance to a midwife ranges from 12\u201330 km in Papua to 1.5 \nkm in Java and Bali.\n47.  HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB are important communicable diseases in Indonesia, which \naffect both child and maternal health. The current challenge is to reduce the current HIV epidemic \nin high-risk groups and to prevent its further spread into the general population. A major barrier to \nmalaria control is the cost of accessing impregnated bed nets. In Indonesia, CDC programs have \nbeen organized vertically, resulting in fragmented service delivery. Comprehensive strategies \npromoting integrated health services that allow for sharing of resources or pooling of funds can \nsupport the containment and reversal of the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics.  \n48.  Even when MNCH and CDC services are locally available, many of the poor still suffer \nfrom access constraints due to the high costs of health care. Out of pocket expenditures\u2014 \nincluding user fees, the cost of drugs, and transportation\u2014are estimated to equal some 70% of \n                                                \n23The Philippines spends about 6% of the total government budget and about 3.2% of its GDP, while Thailand \nspends 13.6% of its budget and 3.3% of its GDP. \n24 The main causes of maternal death include hemorrhaging (25\u201345%), eclampsia (13%), abortion complications \n(11%), and post-natal infections (10%). Underlying factors that also contribute to maternal death include: (i) poor \nmaternal nutrition, such as iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin A deficiency, and protein-energy malnutrition; and (ii) \ninfectious diseases, such as malaria, TB, hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. \n25 The Government\u2019s continuing policy has limitations, as contraceptives are not available to unmarried women \nthrough public channels.  ", "13\ntotal health expenditures. The opportunity cost for women is higher due to the time spent on \nobtaining cost-effective health care for themselves and their children. Low education and lack of \ninformation about available options also limits utilization of health services by the poor and \nwomen.\n49.  The ASKESKIN program addresses some of these constraints by removing the cost \nbarriers to accessing health services by the poor and near-poor, especially women. The program \nhas two components. The first component provides free healthcare services at public health \ncenters (puskesmas) and the second provides inpatient treatment in \u201cthird class\u201d hospitals for the \npoor.  The  program  is  demand-oriented  and  responds  to  utilization  rates  of  health  services. \nASKESKIN benefits are comprehensive (including generic drugs), and there are no deductibles or \nco-payments. In spite of the initial success of ASKESKIN, further information and evaluation of \nprogram impacts are required on (i) utilization rates of health services by type of service, profile of \nusers, and amounts expended by districts to complement the program; and (ii) opportunities to \nprovide feedback to providers on the quality of care rendered through services delivered.  \n50. Poor Quality, Efficiency, and Effectiveness of Health Service Delivery. Government \nhealth  providers  often  lack  incentives  to  work  in  remote areas  and  to  provide  services  in \nsufficient quantity and quality, especially for the poor. It is reported that government health \nworkers are frequently absent from their posts.26 The national aggregate ratios of doctors and \nmidwives to the population are below the 2010 Healthy Indonesia targets, and much lower than \nfound in other countries in the region. There are only 13 doctors and 200 midwives for every \n100,000 people. There are also significant variations in the distribution of health personnel per \ncapita between regions. For example, there are 30\u201340 doctors per 100,000 population in North \nSulawesi  and  Bali,  compared  with  just  6  per  100,000  in  Lampung  and  East  Java.  Some \nprovinces  only  have  20  midwives  per  100,000  people.27  MOH  has  implemented  several \nprograms  in  the  past  to  improve  the  distribution  of  doctors  and  midwives  to  remote  and \nunderserved areas. However, these programs have faced challenges in retaining and motivating \nhealth  service  providers.  They  have  also  failed  to  significantly  improve  the  distribution  or \nretention of providers in poor or remote areas due to insufficient incentives and resulting low \nlevels of remuneration, poor housing, and a lack of water and sanitation facilities. \n51.  The ASKESKIN program has the potential to modify its reimbursement methods to better \nmotivate  providers  to  deliver  key  MDG-related  services.  Under  this  program,  MOH  has \ncontracted PT Askes, a parastatal, to reimburse hospitals on a fee-for-services basis for both \ninpatient and outpatient care. The program also reimburses community health centers, mainly \non a capitation basis, without any performance-based incentives.28 As a third-party, PT Askes \ncould provide a higher capitation to facilities that increase their productivity or achieve other \nperformance targets, especially those linked to MDG-related health services. Public-private \npartnerships  to  better  manage  health  services  could  also  help  motivate  providers  through \nperformance-based initiatives, and yield improved access to affordable and quality health care, \nespecially by the poor and women. \n52. Poor Performance and Accountability of Local Governments and Health Providers. \nMOH issued a decree in 2003 pertaining to 26 types of MSSs, and including 54 indicators, which \n                                                \n26Choudhury, Nazmul, Jeffrey Hammer, Michael Kremer, Karthik Muralidharan, and F. Halsey Rogers. 2005. Missing \nin Action: Teacher and Health Worker Absence in Developing Countries. Journal of Economic Perspectives 20 (1): \n91\u2013116. It was reported that about 40% of government health staff in community health centers were absent from \nfacilities for reasons other than off-site duties. \n27World Bank. 2007.

", "14\nconstitute the minimum level of services local governments must provide to fulfill their obligatory \nfunction of delivering basic health services. Significant challenges have been encountered in \nimplementing the MSSs at the local level, however, due to the (i) excessive number of services \ncovered, (ii) type of indicators used, (iii) level at which the standards are set, (iv) lack of clarity \nabout the obligatory functions of each level of government, and (v) lack of guidelines for local \ngovernments on how to implement the MSSs. The enactment of Government Regulation No. 65 in \n2005,  establishing  guidelines  for  the  development  and  implementation  of  MSSs,  and  the \nsubsequent MOHA regulation in 2007 providing guidance to line ministries, are positive steps to \nsolve some of these problems. But much work still needs to be done to refine and reduce the \nnumber  of  health-related  MSSs,  so  as  to  clearly  define  the  \u201cquantity  and  quality\u201d  of  health \nservices, and the roles and responsibilities of the various levels of government. \n53.  Providing increased public funding for health is a necessary step to improve MDG-\nrelated  performance.  But  improvements  are  needed  in  the  way  additional  resources  are \nchanneled to poor and under-performing localities, and to the poor themselves. One method is \nto channel additional resources through demand-side mechanisms that target the poor, while \nstrengthening accountability between the service provider and client, so as to reduce the large \ndifferentials in most MDG-related impact and intermediate indicators, both across regions and \nbetween socioeconomic groups. The recently established ASKESKIN program moves in the \nright direction, because it: (i) targets the poor with substantial additional resources; (ii) channels \nthe resources to a third-party payer (PT Askes), rather than directly to providers; and (iii) \nexpands the range of providers eligible for reimbursement to the non-governmental sector, \nincluding village midwives.  \n54. Transparency, Monitoring and Evaluation. Health care in Indonesia is provided by a \ncomplex  combination  of  government  and  private  sector  entities.  Very  little  information  is \ncurrently available at the provincial and central levels on the use of local government resources \nin the health sector, including resources provided by MOH. In such an environment, policy \nmakers need reliable information on the sources and uses of funds to enable (i) better planning, \n(ii)  more  accurate  financial  projections  of  health  sector  requirements,  and  identification  of \nopportunities for improvement. The establishment of a national health accounts (NHAs) program \nwould facilitate analysis and tracking of public health expenditures.  \n2.  Lessons Identified \n55.  Recent  evaluations  and  lessons  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  other  development \npartners active in program lending, including for social sectors,29 have recommended that: (i) \npolicy frameworks should not be complex or unrealistic, as this makes them difficult to implement; \n(ii) the program should focus on a few key policy outputs; (iii) the design of policy initiatives should \nbe robust yet flexible enough to withstand a change in government; (iv) policy actions should be \nspecific, measurable, and linked to policy outputs and outcomes; (v) programmatic approaches \nand program clusters spread along a medium-term framework can be effective in tackling (a) \ncomplex policy reform areas and (b) overcoming a scarcity of information; (vi) reforms must be \nphased and fully aligned with the country\u2019s broader medium-term development agenda; (vii) \n                                                \n29 The relevant evaluation studies include, among others: (i) ADB. 2001.

Reforms in the social sectors are complex, as there are important political and economic \nconsiderations, and responsibilities are divided across a number of line ministries, agencies, \nand national and local government jurisdictions. The evaluation findings for ADB\u2019s health and \nnutrition and social protection sector development programs in Indonesia, which were rated as \nsuccessful, recognized the complexity of the reforms. A study of the World Bank\u2019s experience \nwith social sector program lending revealed that while the overall effectiveness and outcomes of \nsocial  development  projects  compares  favorably  with  other  sectors,  providing  integrated \nattention to social development themes under program lending led to better implementation and \nmore sustainable social benefits. However, reforms may take time and must be undertaken \nwithin a medium-term framework.\n57.  The Government has made accelerated achievement of the MDGs a key pillar of its \nagenda, and has demonstrated to continue undertaking the necessary reforms. The PRMAP is \nfully anchored in the Government\u2019s RPJM, meaning there is strong ownership by the relevant line \nministries  and  the  oversight  agencies  (e.g.  BAPPENAS,  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Social \nWelfare [Menko Kesra], and MOF). The reform agenda is broad and challenging as it covers \nseveral social sectors, emphasizing the need for flexibility in reform implementation. Based on the \nabove considerations, a program cluster modality is proposed for the PRMAP. \n3.  Coordination with the Development Partners \n58.  PRMAP has been designed in close coordination with several development partners. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) has provided direct support, \nactively participated in the design of the program, and will cofinance the TA supporting it. \nCoordination has been undertaken with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in \npreparing common approaches to support the Government in establishing a national framework \nfor MDG acceleration. Separate meetings were conducted with the main development partners \nworking in the education and health sectors, particularly the World Bank, to ensure coordination \nand  complementarity  of  approaches  and  avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  The  IMF  was  also \nconsulted on the macroeconomic impacts of PRMAP. The design of the PRMAP policy reforms \nwas shared and discussed on several occasions with the education sector working group, and \nwith  relevant  development  partners  in  the  health  sector  to  ensure  complementarity  and \nagreement, and avoid duplication.30 The development partners coordination matrix, outlining \nsupport in areas related to the PRMAP, is in Appendix 4. The list of external assistance to the \nhealth and education sectors is presented in Supplementary Appendix D. \n4.  ADB Strategy \n59.  ADB committed to the MDGs in 2002. ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy and \nthe  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  for  2006\u20132008  provide  the  broad  framework  for  ADB\u2019s \nengagement and support to MDG acceleration and attainment in the region. At an operational \nlevel, ADB is committed to assisting its developing member countries integrate the MDGs into \n                                                \n30ADB,  World  Bank,  AusAID,  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  European  Commission  are  the  principal \ndevelopment partners in the education sector while ADB, the World Bank, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technishe \nZusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  AusAID,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  the  Joint  United  Nations \nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) are the main partners in the health sector. ", "16\ntheir national poverty reduction strategies and to monitor their progress.31 In 2004, ADB, UNDP \nand the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific embarked on \na  regional  partnership  to  support  monitoring  of  MDG  progress,  raise  awareness,  develop \ncapacity and improve policies and institutions related to achievement of the MDGs. Several \nregional reports32 and technical papers have been produced, improvements have been made to \nthe MDG database, and dissemination and advocacy activities have been conducted. ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for Indonesia 2006\u2013200933 identifies MDG acceleration as \none of its five strategic areas of engagement. PRMAP will be a key input to the realization of this \nstrategy  and  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  under  Pillar  II:  Social  development,34  by \nsupporting improvement of the quantity and quality of social service delivery. \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM\nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n60. Impacts and Outcome. The PRMAP impacts will be to accelerate progress in achieving \nthe MDGs in education (MDG 2), and health (MDGs 4, 5, 6), and contribute to the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction (MDG 1) and gender equality (MDG 3) agendas. The program\u2019s outcome is \nimproved access, equity, and quality of service delivery in the education and health sectors to \naccelerate  progress  toward  the  MDGs.  It  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s national priorities, as reflected in the existing RPJM. 35\nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n61.  The program will assist the Government in reorienting fiscal expenditures to the social \nsectors and undertaking much-needed policy reforms related to three key areas: access and \nequity, quality, and governance. PRMAP will include three main pillars with the following policy \noutputs:\n62. Cross-Sectoral Reforms. PRMAP will support and enhance strategic government-led \nreform initiatives, which will result in: (i) increased budget allocations for health and education, \nfocused  on  MDG-related  programs;  (ii)  improved  performance  incentives  and  geographical \nresource allocations to districts for education and health; (iii) a uniform system for targeting \nMDG-related health and education services to the poor households; (iv) gender equity in access \nto health and education services; and (v) a planning framework for MDG acceleration. \n63. Policy Reforms in the Education Sector for MDG Acceleration. PRMAP will support \nthe Government\u2019s objective of universal basic education leading to: (i) improved access to junior \nsecondary  schools  in  under-served  areas;  (ii)  improved  O&M  support  for  smaller/remote \nschools;  (iii)  increased  affordability  of  education  by  poor  students  and/or  households;  (iv) \nenhanced quality and equitable deployment of teachers; (v) education service delivery that \nmeets MSSs; (vi) improved planning and implementation of education services; and (vii) greater \ntransparency of education outcomes to enhance accountability. \n                                                \n31 ADB. 2004.

The PRMAP supports \nthe Government\u2019s reform agenda, which seeks to expand and improve the equity and quality of \nMDG-related health services for the poor, in order to (i) increase public financing for MDG-\nrelated  health  programs,  (ii) improve  targeting  of  public  health  financing  for  the  poor,  (iii) \nimprove effectiveness of MNCH and reproductive health service delivery by influencing provider \nbehavior,  (iv)  improve  effectiveness  of  CDC  through  integrated  programs,  (v)  improve \nmonitoring of MDG-related health performance, and (vi) improve information with regard to \nMDG-related health expenditures.\n1.  Cross-Sectoral Policy Reforms \n65. Policy Objective (PO) 1: Increased Budget Allocation for MDG-Related Health and \nEducation.  The  Government  has  recognized  the  need  to  increase  overall  social  sector \nexpenditures if it is to achieve its ambitious poverty reduction and MDG acceleration targets. \nThe 2007 PER showed that health and education expenditures have increased significantly. \nBetween 2004 and 2006, real national public expenditure36 on education increased by 53% \n(from Rp49.8 trillion [$ 5.5 billion] to Rp76.2 trillion [$8.3 billion], while expenditure on health \nincreased by 50% (from Rp13.2 trillion [$1.4 billion] to Rp19.8 trillion [$2.2 billion]). During the \nsame period spending on education as a percentage of total public expenditure increased from \n14.2% to 17.2%, while health spending increased from 3.8% to 4.5%. As a percentage of GDP, \nspending on education increased from 2.8% to 3.6% of GDP, and on health from 0.73% to \n0.95%. Between 2005 and 2006, most of the increases from the central government budget \nwere allocated to programs that benefit the poor, such as the BOS, which increased from Rp5.1 \ntrillion ($543 million) to Rp10.2 trillion ($1.1 billion), and the ASKESKIN, which increased from \nRp2.3 trillion ($245 million) to Rp3.6 trillion ($383 million). These programs represented about \n25% of the overall central education and health budgets. The budget allocations for these or \nsimilar programs are expected to be sustained in the coming years; projected 2007 public \nexpenditures  on  education  and  health  will  represent  about  3.9%  and  1.09%  of  GDP, \nrespectively.\nTable 1: National Public Expenditurea\n(Rp trillion) \nEducation  2001  2004  2005  2006b  2007c\nNominal Expenditures  40.5  63.1  79.7  120.2  137.8 \nReal Expenditures (2001 prices)  40.5  49.8  56.9  76.2  82.2 \nAnnual Growth of Real Expenditures (%)  40.3  (8.4)  14.4  33.8  7.8 \nAs % of Total National Expenditures  11.4  14.2  14.9  17.2  17.5 \nAs % of GDP  2.4  2.8  2.9  3.6  3.9 \nHealth  \nNominal Expenditures  9.3  16.7  22.0  31.5  38.6 \nReal Expenditures (2001 prices)  9.3  13.2  15.5  19.8  22.8 \nAnnual Growth of Real Expenditures (%)  28.1  (1.8)  19.4  26.7  15.4 \nAs % of Total National Expenditures  2.6  3.8  4.1  4.5  4.9 \nAs % of GDP  0.55  0.73  0.81  0.95  1.09 \nGDP = gross domestic product, Rp = rupiah. \na  National public expenditures includes spending by central, provincial and district governments. \nb  Preliminary result and estimates of subnational allocations. \nc  Estimates based on the approved Government budget for 2007. \nSource: World Bank, Ministry of Finance, and Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional; World Bank. 2007. \nIndonesia Public Expenditure Review.

The Government has significantly increased the size and \n                                                \n36Includes central, provincial, and district government expenditures. ", "18\nscope of the DAK targeted for the health and education sectors. From 2004 to 2007, the total \nDAK allocation for education and health increased sevenfold, with DAK allocations for education \nincreasing from $71 million to $569 million, and health allocations increasing from $50 million to \n$370  million.  These  increases  will  provide  additional  resources  to  specific  districts  for  the \nrehabilitation of schools and health centers and the purchase of equipment and facilities, and \nare expected to contribute to increased access and quality of services. The modification of the \nDAK technical criteria for education and health in 2006 offers an opportunity to attract and retain \neducation and health personnel to remote areas, as districts are now allowed to use DAK funds \nfor (i) the procurement of medical and non-medical equipment in health clinics and furniture in \nschools; (ii) the construction and rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities; and (iii) housing \nfor school teachers, doctors, nurses, and midwives. \n67.  Problems remain with the existing DAK allocation formula, however. The current system \ndoes  not  provide  operational  expenditures  for  health  and  education,  or  incentives  for  the \ndistricts to improve their performance in service delivery, both of which are keys to accelerating \nMDG attainment. Improvements are also necessary in the horizontal distribution of resources, to \nensure districts most in need are targeted. In addition, significant efforts are required to improve \nmonitoring systems to track the use of the DAK at the district level.  \n68.  Reform of the DAK is under way to transform it into a more relevant instrument for \nearmarking funds to specific districts with insufficient health and education resources. Measures \nfor  the  improvement  of  the  DAK  are  included  in  the  National  Action  Plan  on  Fiscal \nDecentralization. MOF and BAPPENAS, in coordination with the Regional Autonomy Advisory \nCouncil, are formulating recommendations to strengthen the DAK framework, improve the fund \ndistribution  criteria  among  districts,  and  promote  accountability.  The  recommendations  will \ninclude suggestions for vertical and horizontal allocation and development of conditions to \nsuccessfully support achievement of the MDGs at the local government level. MOHA is also \npreparing a regulation on performance evaluation of local governments, which could include \nfinancial incentives to reward or penalize local governments based on performance. MONE and \nMOH, in coordination with MOF, will assess options for including mechanisms in the DAK \ntechnical guidelines to allocate resources more equitably to districts, and to include incentives to \ndistricts  to  improve  performance  relative  to  MDG-related  indicators.  PRMAP  will  support \ninitiatives seeking to increase access and equity, and the implementation of performance-based \nallocation of resources at national and district levels, in order to improve accountability in health \nand education program implementation. \n69. PO 3: Establishment of a Uniformed System for Targeting the Poor. BAPPENAS, with \nthe BPS, MOH, and MONE, has prepared guidelines for the establishment of a mass database of \npoor and near-poor households for a new poverty reduction program, the Program Keluarga \nHarapan (PKH), which plans to provide conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to 500,000 households \nin its initial phase in 2007.37 The database will improve the previous one developed for the former \nunconditional cash transfers program that used a combination of geographic and household \ntargeting techniques. The focus of the PKH on poverty reduction and on improving access to \nMDG-related  health  and  education  services  fosters  dialogue  among  the  key  stakeholders\u2014\nBAPPENAS, BPS, MONE, MORA and MOH\u2014and raises the possibility that MOH, MONE and \nMORA may adopt a uniform targeting system for improving access by the poor to other MDG-\nrelated education and health initiatives. Establishment of a uniform targeting system will help \nimprove  coverage  of  MDG-related  health  and  education  programs  for  the  poor  and  reduce \n                                                \n37To cover selected sub-districts in seven provinces in its pilot phase, the Government has allocated about $1 billion \nfor this program in 2007. The program will provide cash transfers to the poor, conditional on families enrolling and \nkeeping children in schools and utilizing health services, vaccinations, and other MNCH programs.  ", "19\nleakages to the non-poor. Although the initial costs of developing a uniform database may be \nsignificant, in the longer term it will provide savings by avoiding duplication of effort by multiple \nagencies, and improving transparency.  \n70. PO 4: Achievement of Gender Equity in Access to Health and Education Services. \nThe PRMAP supports the Government\u2019s gender mainstreaming efforts pursuant to Presidential \nInstruction No. 9/2000 and subsequent health and education ministerial regulations and sector \naction  plans.  In  2006,  BAPPENAS  completed  an  evaluation  on  the  status  of  gender \nmainstreaming in nine sectors, including health and education.38 Recommendations focused on \nstrengthening policies, institutional frameworks, information systems and human resources within \neach of the sectors to support gender equity. MOH has responded to the evaluation by issuing a \nMinisterial Decree, which outlines steps to be taken to improve gender mainstreaming within the \nministry, including the appointment of directors for gender mainstreaming under each directorate. \nMONE, in its commitment to implement Education for All, includes a chapter on gender equality,39\nand  the  topic  is  featured  in  other  sections  on  formal  and  non-formal  education.  A  joint \nmemorandum of understanding was signed in 2006 between MONE, the Ministry of Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment (MOWE), and MOHA to increase efforts to lower adult illiteracy rates, particularly \nfor females. The RPJM includes a commitment to lower illiteracy rates to 5% by 2009. This policy \naction builds on the National Literacy Movement for Indonesia, launched by the President in \nDecember  2004,  which  seeks  to  strengthen  cooperation  on  literacy  within  communities  and \nbetween various levels of government, and promote the importance of literacy through awareness \nprograms. \n71.  Despite Government efforts to mainstream gender, the lack of information on gender-\nrelated MDGs remains a challenge. Sex-disaggregated key health and education indicators are \nneeded to better monitor progress on the gender-related MDGs, and to target resources more \nefficiently for accelerated attainment of the MDGs. Some health and education indicators that are \nalready disaggregated by sex may require additional proxy indicators to improve monitoring and \nreporting (e.g., immunization coverage or percentage of births attended by skilled personnel). \nAdditional indicators could be considered, such as: (i) primary completion rates for boys and girls \n(MDG 2); (ii) under-5 mortality rates for girls and boys (MDG 4); and (iii) percentage of all \nreproductive-age  women  and  their  sexual  partners  using  modern  contraceptives  (MDG  6). \nInclusion of an agreed set of sex-disaggregated indicators in the medium-term development plans \nof  MONE,  MORA  and  MOH  would  help  mainstream  gender  issues  relating  to  health  and \neducation in the planning and budgeting processes.  \n72. PO 5: A Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration is Established. The RPJM and \nthe SNPK include the MDGs as a key element, and recognize the need for mainstreaming \nMDGs at the local government level. The Government presented the 2005 MDG Progress \nReport at the UN General Assembly in September 2005. Guidelines need to be developed to \nassist local governments and sector agencies, such as education and health, to mainstream the \nMDGs in their development and sector plans and budgets. Plans for the preparation of a \ncomprehensive roadmap for MDG acceleration could include strategies for: (i) developing a \nflexible institutional framework for the accelerated achievement of the MDGs involving key \ncentral  government  ministries  and  local  governments;  (ii)  increasing  political  and  public \nawareness about the MDGs; (iii) involving civil society, private sector and research institutions in \nefforts  to  attain  the  MDGs;  (iv)  improving  data  collection,  processing  and  monitoring \nmechanisms,  and  reporting  of  MDG-related  indicators;  (v)  assessing  cost  and  budget \n                                                \n38 MONE. 2005.

Education Sector Reforms \n73.  The  PRMAP  supports  education  policy  reforms  to  address  key  access,  equity  and \nquality constraints as outlined in MONE\u2019s medium term plan (2005\u20132009) and MORA\u2019s strategic \nplan. The plans respond to the priorities outlined in the RPJM, the SNPK, and Indonesia\u2019s \ninternational commitments. The MONE and MORA plans organize education strategies, targets, \nand programs under three main policies: (i) expansion of access and equity; (ii) improvement of \nquality, efficiency, and effectiveness; and (iii) improvement of governance, transparency, and \naccountability. Major priorities include (i) achieving the goal of universal access to 9 years of \nbasic education by 2009; (ii) expanding gross enrolment rates in senior secondary education; \n(iii) raising education standards and relevance at all levels, including through efficient teacher \npreparation  and  deployment;  (iv)  strengthening  results-oriented  education  governance  and \nmanagement systems, especially at district and school/institutional levels; and (v) improved \nresults orientation of sector planning and monitoring systems.\na.  Expand  Equitable  Access  to  Basic  Education  Particularly  for  the \nPoor\n74.  The Government\u2019s key strategies for enabling equitable access to basic education include \n(i)  an  expanded  junior  secondary  school  construction  program  in  under-served  areas;  (ii) \nreduction of direct and indirect cost barriers through the expansion of school operational budgets; \nand (iii) expansion of primary and junior secondary school programs for school dropouts. \n75. PO 6: Improved Access to Junior Secondary Education in Underserved Areas. A \nnumber  of  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  reduce  access  barriers.  A  priority  is  the \nconstruction of new junior secondary schools and/or madrasah, especially in districts with low \nenrolment.  The  introduction  of  one-roof  schools  (combined  primary  and  junior  secondary \nschools on the same site) is designed to reduce primary grade dropout and repetition, and \nincrease transition rates to junior secondary education. Implementation of these initiatives will \nreduce  the  distance  to  junior  secondary  schools  and  consequent  travel  costs,  which  are \nimportant obstacles for the poor. Between 2005 and 2007 MONE and MORA allocated Rp \n4.252  billion  ($465  million)  for  the  establishment  of  2,416  integrated  schools,  and  the \nconstruction of 1,345 new junior secondary schools and 32,921 new classrooms in existing \njunior  secondary  schools.  This  initiative  is  also  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on \nmaintaining  or  increasing  the  number  of  girls  attending  junior  secondary  schools  and/or \nmadrasah in regions where female enrolment is low. MORA continues to invest in the poorest \ncommunity-run schools. \n76.  While  considerable  investments  are  planned by  both  MONE  and  MORA  for  school \ninfrastructure, improved targeting and utilization of facilities is also required. Under SP2, local \ngovernments  will  undertake  participatory  school  mapping  with  local  communities  to  better \nunderstand and respond to demand-side issues. Participatory school mapping is a departure \nfrom purely technical, geographic information system- (GIS) based school mapping. While GIS-\nmapping can accurately identify the optimum location of schools, based on demographic and \nspatial data, it may not alert governments to the underlying socioeconomic factors that prevent \nchildren from attending school, despite the provision of physical facilities. Increasing the local \nownership of and stake in school construction and rehabilitation will lower construction costs, \nand improve utilization of facilities. This will yield better returns on the investments made in \nschool infrastructure development under SP3. ", "21\n77. PO 7: Improved O&M Support for Smaller and Remote Schools and Elimination of \nFees. The introduction of the BOS in 2005 and its expansion in 2006 and 2007 provides funds \nto cover school O&M and indirectly eliminate school fees. All public and private schools are \neligible for the program. The BOS program provides block grants to schools based on student \nhead counts. It has covered about 29.5 million students at the primary and 11.7 million at the \njunior secondary level. The program provides about $25 per year for primary school students \nand $35 per year for junior secondary students. The provision of funds based on student head \ncount  provides  incentives  to  schools  to  expand  their  coverage  area  and  overall  student \nnumbers. The program has been successful in improving the predictability of school financing, \nand providing reliable support to schools. Its simple design has rendered the program highly \ntransparent, at least down to the school management level. \n78.  BOS does need some improvement and refinement, however, if it is to be transformed \ninto a more targeted and efficient instrument, particularly for small, remote schools and for those \nwith many poor students. A key policy action under SP2 will be a comprehensive review of the \nallocation policy and financing and implementation of BOS and other O&M support programs. \nThe review will consider whether any special assistance programs need to be developed for the \npoorest districts, taking into account (i) regional differences in costs; (ii) school size differences \nin fixed and variable costs; (iii) the indirect impacts of BOS in decreasing school fees or other \ncontributions from the poor; (iv) the costs associated with meeting priority MSSs, such as for \nlearning materials and teacher training; and (v) findings from internal audit reports. While the \nGovernment recognizes that a more pro-poor allocation policy for O&M assistance needs to be \ndeveloped for smaller, more remote or poorer schools, preferential allocations under BOS need \nto be closely monitored and supported under SP2. Under SP3, it is expected that a revised BOS \nallocation policy for poor and remote districts will be implemented. \n79. PO 8: Increased Affordability of Education by Poor Students/Households. In 2006, \ntransition scholarships were introduced to improve NERs in junior secondary schools and help \npoor primary school graduates meet the costs of entering junior secondary. About 147,000 poor \nstudents received scholarships. Under SP2, scholarships will be expanded to enable poor \nstudents meet the direct and opportunity costs of education. Plans are underway to pilot a CCT \nscheme to improve demand for education and increase primary to junior secondary transition \nand retention rates among the poor. Under SP3, these financial support programs to improve \nenrollments and retention of students will be evaluated to improve the design and targeting of \npro-poor programs.\nb.  Improve Basic Education Quality, Efficiency, and Effectiveness \n80.  Key government strategies to improve quality, relevance and effectiveness include (i) \nintroduction  and  implementation  of  new  teacher  professionalism  and  quality  assurance \nstandards, through new legislation and organizational reform at central, provincial and district \nlevels; (ii) review of teacher utilization and deployment norms, incorporating potential measures \nto increase non-salary operational spending, especially on instructional materials and school \nmaintenance;  and  (iii)  expansion  of  education  standards-setting  and  monitoring  systems \nthrough the establishment of the Board of National Education Standards (BSNP). \n81. PO  9: Enhanced  Quality  and  Equitable  Deployment  of  Teachers.  Law  14  on \nTeachers and Lectures was approved in December 2005. The Law makes provision for a \ndoubling by 2015 of teacher remuneration through professional incentive awards. Teachers \nworking in remote areas will also receive a special allowance. Two regulations to implement the \nprovisions of the law for the professional development and incentive structures for teachers and \nlecturers are currently under preparation. The legislation includes a strategy for providing salary ", "22\nand non-salary incentives to boost the deployment of teachers to under-served areas. It also \nincludes  measures  related  to  management  and  quality  assurance  of  teachers  and  other \neducational personnel, including school directors, and for strengthening teacher performance \nmonitoring and quality assurance systems. Given the scale of teacher upgrading required, the \ndesign of cost-efficient and sustainable professional development programs and incentives for \ndeployment in under-served areas are an urgent priority and will be developed under SP2. \nUnder SP3, both MONE and MORA will publish a report on teacher deployment to under-served \nareas.\n82. PO  10: Education  Service  Delivery  Meeting  MSSs.  A  number  of  key  regulatory \nactions have recently been taken to set the foundation for education reform, which will lead to \nincreased accountability of district governments and schools to deliver higher quality education. \nAn independent BSNP was established in mid-2005 through issuance of Regulation 19/2005. \nBSNP has developed legislation on \u201cStandards on Content\u201d (Regulation No 22/2006), and \n\u201cStandards on Competence\u201d (Regulation No 22/2006). Regulation No. 24/2006 has been issued \nto clarify the roles of different levels of government in the implementation of these standards. \nThe development, approval and monitoring of national education standards in eight key areas is \nexpected  to  be  completed  under  SP2.  With  TA  support  from  ADB  and  the  European \nCommission, MONE is also planning to develop MSSs for critical national standards relevant to \nthe achievement of the education-related MDGs, to be applied at the district level. Under SP3, it \nis expected that MSSs in at least two categories of national standards, especially those related \nto teachers, facilities, and learning materials, will be implemented by selected districts.40\nc.  Governance, Transparency, and Accountability. \n83. PO  11: Improved  Planning  and  Implementation  of  Education  Services.  The \nGovernment has demonstrated high-level leadership and ownership of the education reform \nprogram. A joint plan for the achievement of 9-year basic education (Grand Design for Basic \nEducation [2006\u20132009]) was completed by MONE and MORA in August 2006. Under SP2, an \nassessment of sector performance, including the roles of different levels of government in \ndelivering education services and progress toward the MDGs, will be undertaken in preparation \nfor the 2010\u20132015 Strategic Plan for the Education Sector. To accelerate the attainment of the \nMDGs, specific attention will be paid to the assessment of pro-poor programs for education and \npossibilities for improvement and expansion. Some analytical work will also be undertaken to \nassess whether it is possible to adopt a medium-term expenditure framework to help improve \nthe  predictability  of  sector  financing  in  terms  of  size,  flow,  and  the  use  of  educational \nexpenditures over the medium term. Under SP3, it is expected that a medium-term development \nplan will be approved to provide good quality services in under-served areas.  \n84. PO 12: Greater Transparency of Education Outcomes to Enhance Accountability. \nIncreased  financing  of  education  sector  reforms  naturally  calls  for  greater  efforts  to  boost \ngovernance, transparency and accountability for outcomes (e.g. through the results of national \nexams, which MONE and MORA now publish). The Center for Educational Assessment has \nused the results of the junior secondary level national exams, as well as results of the Program \nfor International Student Assessment, and Trends in International Mathematics and Science \nStudies, to inform government policies for improving accountability and the education quality. A \nwell  designed  and  reliable  survey  of  communities  will  be  conducted  under  SP2  to  obtain \nfeedback on both the positive and negative aspects of basic education service delivery. A \ncitizen report card survey will also be undertaken in three districts under SP2. \n                                                \n40A regulation instructing line ministries in the preparation of MSSs was issued by MOHA in 2007. The Ministry is \nalso preparing legislation to guide local governments in the implementation of MSSs developed by line ministries.  ", "23\n85.  The  technical  guidelines  for  ministerial  decree  No.  044/u/2002  will  be  reviewed  to \nincrease the proportion of females participating in school committees and district education \nboards to at least 40%, to ensure the increase of the role of women in the governance of the \neducation system. At the national level, the ministry of education has established a number of \nmeasurable anti-corruption performance indicators in the education medium-term plan41 with the \nsummary of the results to be published on their websites under SP3.  \n3.  Health Sector Reforms  \n86.  Health sector reforms supported under PRMAP include (i) expanding access to health \nservices, especially for the poor and women; (ii) improving quality, efficiency, and effectiveness \nof health services; and (iii) enhancing governance in health service delivery. \na.  Expand  Access  to  Health  Services,  especially  for  the  Poor  and \nWomen\n87.  PO 13: Increased Central Budget for MDG-Related Health Programs. Between 2005 \nand 2007, MOH increased its budget allocation for MDG-related health programs by more than \n50%. In 2007, more than 20% of the MOH budget is expected to be allocated for MNCH and \nCDC programs. Even with these increases, however, the country\u2019s budget allocations in these \nareas  remain  far  below  those  of  other  countries  in  the  region. In  the  coming  years,  the \nGovernment will need to increase budgetary allocations for health, and the MOH will need to \nimprove budget targeting for (i) MDG-related health programs, such as MNCH and CDC; and (ii) \nregions with poorer health outcomes. During SP2 and SP3, MOH is planning to increase its \nbudget allocation for programs that would accelerate meeting the health-related MDG targets. \nInvestments in preventive care services and communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and \nmalaria, must be prioritized. These actions are expected to disproportionately benefit the poor, \nwho utilize public sector health services for reproductive and child health care, and suffer from \ncommunicable diseases. \n88. PO 14: Improved Targeting of Public Financing for Health Services for the Poor. In\n2005, the Government introduced a new healthcare scheme, the ASKESKIN program, which \naimed to: (i) improve targeting of budget resources to health services utilized by the poor, (ii) \nincrease  financing  for  O&M  expenses  of  public  sector  health  facilities,  and  (iii)  increase \nefficiency of funds management through contracting PT Askes to independently manage the \nfunds and provider contracts. Sixty million poor people were entitled to ASKESKIN benefits, \nincluding primary, secondary and tertiary care if provided by public clinics and hospitals. The \npoor receive free services on presentation of a health (ASKESKIN) card, or a letter from local \nauthorities indicating their poverty status. ASKESKIN\u2019s design has evolved since 2005 with the \naim of increasing access by the poor to priority health services by allowing reimbursement of \nservices  provided  by  eligible  non-government  providers  (i.e.  midwives  and  select  private \nhospitals).42 The program provides allocations to public clinics, utilizing a formula to favor those \nclinics with a higher proportion of the poor within their target areas, and those in remote areas.  \n89.  While the ASKESKIN program has removed some of the key cost barriers preventing the \npoor  from  accessing  health  services,  the  program  has  limitations,  because  it  covers  only \nmedical care costs, and not non-medical service costs, such as transportation, inpatient meals, \nand contraceptives. The Government recognizes that there is scope to improve and refine the \neffectiveness of this program, and is planning under SP2 to conduct a comprehensive analysis \n                                                \n41 These include targets for: (i) number of corruption charges, (ii) amount of funds subject to corruption investigation, \nand (iii) amount of funds subject to being reclaimed. \n42The poor use private service providers, especially midwives, in 57% of cases. ", "24\nof options for the revision of the ASKESKIN program design and implementation modalities. The \nevaluation will take into account previous assessments,43 feedback related to recent program \nadjustments, and the longer-term development of a national health insurance policy. Under \nSP3, MOH will utilize the analysis to revise the program\u2019s design and implementation strategy, \nin order to: i) improve targeting of benefits to the poor; ii) increase access and utilization of \nprimary care services; iii) improve integration of primary care services delivery (e.g., family \nplanning,  antenatal,  delivery  and  postnatal  MNCH  services);  and  iv)  increase  program \nmanagement efficiency to increase incentives for health service providers. The ASKESKIN \nprogram could also modify its reimbursement methods to better motivate providers to deliver \nkey MDG-related services.  \nb.   Improve Quality and Efficiency of Health Services \n90. PO  15:  Improved  Effectiveness  of  MNCH/RH  Services  through  Influencing \nProvider Behavior. In May 2006, the Government modified the program for recruiting and \ncontracting temporary doctors and midwives by including additional financial incentives to attract \nthem to remote areas. The program will provide an additional monthly salary of Rp.7.5 million \n($828) to specialist doctors; Rp. 5 million ($552) to doctors, and Rp. 2.5 million ($276) to \nmidwives working in remote areas. The program is expected to improve the quality of MNCH \nservices. Provider payment mechanisms introduced through ASKESKIN that influence financial \nincentives will also affect provider location choices and influence provision behavior. Since \n2006, district governments can also use DAK funds to construct water and sanitation facilities \nand housing for doctors, nurses and midwives in remote areas, so as to attract and retain health \npersonnel. These actions are expected to increase the availability and quality of MNCH services \nin remote areas. \n91.  A systematic review of provider payment modalities in Indonesia is needed to inform \nevidence-based policy development with respect to improving availability of health personnel in \nremote and underserved areas. Under SP2, MOH plans to commission an assessment to \ncomprehensively document all the  methods used to attract and retain health personnel in \nremote and underserved areas. The assessment will analyze how the different alternatives have \ninfluenced the distribution of health personnel, and the provision of health services and health \noutcomes, with particular attention to increasing provision of integrated primary health services \nfor  women  and  children.  In  the  process,  MOH  will  be  improving  its  database  on  health \npersonnel. During SP3, MOH will utilize the findings and recommendations of the assessment in \nrevising provider payment mechanisms.  \n92. PO  16:  Improved  Effectiveness  of  CDC  through  Integrated  Programs.  The\nGovernment is developing comprehensive strategies for CDC (especially for HIV/AIDS, malaria \nand  TB),  including  elaboration  of  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  various  ministries,  and \nmechanisms for coordination of efforts across ministries. In 2006, MOH developed a National \nPolicy and Strategy for Reproductive Health that elaborates the efforts of relevant ministries to \nimprove reproductive health access and outcomes. This policy integrates various elements of \nreproductive health under one coordinating strategy, including maternal health, child health, \nfamily planning, and prevention and treatment of sexually-transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS. \nIn addition, MOH is developing more detailed ministerial-level strategies to strengthen CDC, \nincluding provision of integrated preventive and curative health care at the community and \nhealth-center level. For example, MOH has endorsed national guidelines for mitigating TB that \n                                                \n43An initial rapid assessment of the program in six provinces was undertaken by the Government between March \nand June 2006, with ADB and World Bank support. The assessment identified the need to improve targeting of \nbeneficiaries, provide public information about the program among the poor to increase demand for health \nservices, develop a complaint resolution mechanism, and strengthen M&E. ", "25\nspecify strategies and plans for TB control for the period 2006 to 2010, including guidelines for \ndevelopment of public-private partnerships in TB case detection and treatment. MOH is also \nsupporting provision of information, education, and communication activities through the Center \nfor Health Promotion, so as to enhance the knowledge, attitudes and practices of individuals, \nhouseholds and communities to prevent the contraction and spread of communicable diseases. \n93.  During  SP2,  the  National  AIDS  Commission  has  finalized  the  national  strategy  for \nHIV/AIDS mitigation for 2008 to 2012, including the roles and responsibilities of all relevant \nministries, the private sector and civil society. In support of national efforts to mitigate HIV/AIDS, \nMOH will approve the Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Mitigation in Indonesia, 2008 to 2012, that \nintegrates HIV/AIDS control efforts in all relevant MOH programs. HIV/AIDS strategies will \nreflect surveys findings related to the distribution of the disease and existing evaluations related \nto the effectiveness of current HIV/AIDS strategies and programs. In addition to surveillance, \nvoluntary testing and treatment, national and MOH strategies will include actions to strengthen \nthe knowledge, attitudes and practices of individuals, households and communities in relation to \nHIV/AIDS prevention. HIV/AIDS strategies will be coordinated with TB control efforts. Under \nSP3, MOH will complete and present to the National AIDS Commission an analysis of the costs \nand available sources of financing for the MOH component of the Government\u2019s response to the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. 44\n94. PO  17:  Improved  Monitoring  of  MDG-Related  Health  Performance.  MOH  has \nprepared a revised list of district MSSs and indicators. The list contains 8 types of MSSs with 28 \nindicators. The need to monitor local government progress and performance in achieving the \nMDGs were key criteria in developing the revised list of indicators. Of the 28 indicators, 10 refer \ndirectly to MNCH services, while several others monitor CDC-related aspects, such as TB \ndetection rates, cases of diarrhea treated, or the number of villages in the district that receive \ntimely disease outbreaks response.  \n95.  MOH plans to refine the health-related MSSs and endorse them through a ministerial \ndecree. The MSSs prepared by MOH will be first reviewed by the National Consultative Team,45\nand submitted for approval to the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council. The updated MSSs \ndecree will include health-related MDGs and identify intermediate indicators for child nutrition, \nmaternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, and TB. To the extent appropriate and feasible, MOH will \nidentify intermediate indicators that are harmonized with health-related MDG indicators. MOH \nwill undertake to modify their health information system to track the performance of MSSs \nindicators and link the allocation of human, material and financial resources to performance at \nthe  national  and  sub-national  levels.  These  actions  will  benefit  strategy  development  and \nresource management related to achievement of the health-related MDGs. The introduction of \nperformance-based contracts, and incentives for public and private sector service providers to \nbetter manage district level health services, based on a short list of measurable MSSs, could \nincrease their motivation and yield improved access to affordable and quality health care, \nespecially by the poor and women. \n                                                \n44A recent survey, which focused in particular on two high-risk groups (intravenous drug users and commercial sex \nworkers and their partners), was undertaken to estimate the distribution of HIV/AIDS. The Coordinating Ministry for \nPeople\u2019s Welfare (Menko Kestra) issued a Ministerial Decree in 2007 to coordinate multisectoral efforts to reduce \nHIV/AIDS transmission by use of intravenous drugs. The MOH has issued a Ministerial Decree on the Appointment \nof Referral Hospitals for HIV/AIDS and Service Standards that details standards required for select public and \nprivate sector hospitals to provide HIV/AIDS testing and treatment services. \n45Consisting of ministers, directors general and related directors under Bappenas, MOF, MOHA, and the state \napparatus minister. ", "26\n  c.  Enhance Governance in Health Service Delivery \n96. PO  18:  Improved  Financial  Information  with  Regard  to  MDG-Related  Health \nExpenditures. The  PER,  carried  out  by  BAPPENAS  and  MOF  with  World  Bank  support, \nprovides  an  analysis  of  overall  health  expenditures  by  central,  provincial  and  district \ngovernments.  It  presents  a  review  of  health  financing  issues  that  contributes  to  the \nunderstanding  of  MDG-related  expenditures.  However,  the  PER  did  not  include  detailed \nanalysis of public sector health expenditure by program, especially at the national and sub-\nnational levels, as such information is not readily available.  \n97.  To improve the completeness, quality of information and analysis of total and public \nexpenditures  for  health  under  SP2,  BAPPENAS  will  lead  efforts  to  develop  a  plan  for \ninstitutionalization of a NHAs program, including specification of the responsible agencies and \nterms of reference for conduct of the NHAs; the plan will be used by the Government to \nestablish the program. NHAs detail how resources are used, and if implemented on a regular \nbasis, can track health expenditure trends. NHAs can also be used to make financial projections \nof health system requirements and identify opportunities for improvement. Health accounts can \nhelp track use of resources to achieve the MDGs and other global initiatives. Under SP3, NHAs \nwill be produced for at least one year between 2008 and 2010, based on the plan developed. \nMOH is also planning to retrospectively analyze public expenditure for health for the period \n2003 to 2006, based on the initial analysis prepared by the PER. These actions will contribute to \nimproving  the  transparency  of  health  expenditures  and  programmatic  and  geographic \nallocations. Such information will improve the targeting of public expenditures to health-related \nMDG programs and to districts with poor performance with respect to the MDG indicators. \nC.  Linkages with Other Assistance \n98.  The design and implementation of the PRMAP have been closely coordinated with \nongoing ADB programs and projects. ADB\u2019s Development Policy Support Programs I and II \nincluded several crosscutting reforms that are related to social sector services delivery.46 These \nprograms have focused on (i) creating fiscal space for further investment in social sectors; (ii) \nthe improvement of budget and financial reporting and accounting mechanisms to improve \ngovernance and reduce corruption; (iii) the reform of the civil service, through the design of a \nnew job classification and remuneration policy; (iv) the development of a program for conditional \ncash transfers to the poor, and monitoring of the effectiveness and fiduciary assessment of this \nprogram.  The  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram47 supported measures that had positive impacts on the financing of decentralized \nsocial service delivery, such as (i) the revised Law on Fiscal Balance and its implementing \nregulations; and (ii) the clarification of the roles and responsibilities of each level of government \nfor social services, such as the establishment of the Regional Autonomy Advisory Council and \npreparation of the National Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization. PRMAP will build on these \nreforms by supporting the reform of DAK, the development of MSSs for the education and \nhealth sectors, and the improvement of incentives for teachers and health personnel. \n                                                \n46 ADB  has  adopted  a  dual-track  approach  to  enhance  the  linkage  and  synergy  between  cross-cutting \nmacroeconomic reforms and deeper sector-level reforms. This dual-track approach is outlined in ADB. 2005. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of \nIndonesia for theDevelopment Policy Support Program. Manila (Loan 2228-INO, para. 7).  \n47 ADB. 2005.

", "27\n99.  Several other ADB projects complement PRMAP in key sectors relevant for achievement \nof the MDGs. The Decentralized Health Services I and II48 projects support the strengthening of \ndistrict  capacity  in  planning,  performance-based  budgeting  for  the  health  sector,  and  the \ndevelopment of incentive schemes for redistributing staff to remote and underserved areas in 200 \ndistricts. The Decentralized Basic Education Project49 provides support to schools and districts for \nthe preparation of school development plans, and for developing and improving the functioning of \nschool committees. It also supports capacity-building activities at the district level to improve \nplanning, management and budgeting of education services. The Madrasah Education Support \nproject50 will provide quality education services for the poor in underserved areas. The Community \nWater Services and Health Project,51 which supports access to safe drinking water and sanitation, \nwill have a positive impact on the reduction of child mortality rates in rural areas. The Nutrition \nImprovement Through Community Empowerment Project52 will contribute to improved maternal \nand child health through promotion of better nutrition, breast-feeding, and other community-based \ninitiatives. TA will also be provided to develop and implement MSSs in the education sector at the \ndistrict level. The PRMAP reforms will enhance the sustainability of these projects and assist in \nthe development of an improved policy framework for implementing them. \nD.  Important Features \n100.  PRMAP\u2019s overall design directly supports the Government\u2019s medium-term development \nvision, as articulated in the RPJM, and the medium-term plans for the health and education \nsectors. It is anchored in the Government\u2019s policy reform agenda and actions and emphasizes \ngovernment leadership and ownership. The program recognizes recent key policy actions, while \nestablishing a medium-term framework to continue the complex reform process at a flexible \npace. The design of PRMAP as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms provides the \nflexibility  needed  by  an  emerging  middle-income  country  such  as  Indonesia,  which  is \nundergoing  a  governance  and  fiscal  transition,  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  among \nstakeholders with competing interests. \n101.  The PRMAP is the first program loan from ADB focused on the MDGs. The program \ntackles the multidimensional aspects of poverty with particular attention to non-income MDGs, \nespecially the lack of access by the poor to quality health and education services. It also \nrecognizes cross-sectoral linkages and supports the development of interagency networks to \ndevelop and implement a complex reform agenda. PRMAP complements other interventions by \nADB and its development partners through projects and programs for specific sectors and \nmultisectoral development policy loans. It will provide an overall framework and develop a \nroadmap for the accelerated achievement of the MDGs. \n                                                \n48ADB. 2000.

", "28\n102.   The program and the supporting TA will strengthen capacity in the Government\u2019s education \nand health ministries with respect to strategic, policy oversight, M&E and supervisory functions. It \nwill also assist the Government in developing incentive mechanisms for local governments to \nimprove efficiency and accountability. This approach aims at addressing the challenge of improving \nhealth and education public service delivery within a progressively decentralized framework, while \nensuring rapid acceleration of progress towards meeting the MDG targets. \nE.  Financing Plan \n103.  The PRMAP adopts a program cluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms, \neach supported by a single-tranche loan and a specific loan agreement. Intervals of about 2 years \neach are envisaged between the subprograms. Thus, subject to adequate progress and approval \nof Subprogram 1 (SP1) around October 2007, Subprogram 2 (SP 2) could be considered for \napproval in 2009, and Subprogram 3 (SP 3) in 2011.  \n104.  For SP1, the Government has requested a loan from ADB of $400 million, to support the \nreforms and policy actions outlined in the development policy letter and policy matrix. The loan \nsize has been determined by the strength of the policy package and its development impact, the \nimportance of the sectors covered and investment needs in the education and health sectors. \nSome  adjustment  cost  arising  from  the  establishment  of  new  programs,  such  as  BOS  or \nASKESKIN, the implementation of surveys and development of a database to identify the poor, \nand the preparation of MSSs for education and health services were also considered. The \nreform agenda for SP2, and especially for SP3, will be refined to reflect the progress made and \nevolving circumstances. The Government envisages support from ADB of $200 million each for \nSP2 and SP3. The amounts will be reconfirmed during the PRMAP review and the processing \nof each subprogram.  \n105.  In terms of overall financing requirements in 2007, the Government has requested $2.1 \nbillion53 in program loans from ADB, Japan and the World Bank. This reflects a significantly \nhigher fiscal deficit of around 1.6% of GDP, due to increased spending in health and education \nand other investment and reconstruction efforts. In 2007, total national expenditures for the \neducation sector are expected to increase by approximately $1.928 billion and for the health \nsector by $778 million. The central government has allocated an additional $852 million for \neducation and $406 million for health, with the remaining funds provided by local governments. \nWithout  PRMAP  support,  sustaining  these  necessary  increases  in  education  and  health \nexpenditures may not be possible.  \n106.  The program loan of $400 million for SP1 will be funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, and will have (i) a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; (ii) an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; (iii) a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; (iv) conversion options that may be \nexercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines; and (v) such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that this choice was its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on or any communication or advice from ADB.  \n                                                \n53This comprises (i) from ADB, $400 million for the PRMAP, $200 million for the Development Policy Support \nProgram 3, and $300 for the Capital Market Development Cluster Program; (ii) from the World Bank, $600 million \nthrough its Development Policy Loan 4 and $200 million for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development \nProgram; and (iii) from the Government of Japan, $200 million through cofinancing of the Development Policy Loan \n4 and the $200 million Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. ", "29\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n107. A  Program  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  and  a  program  technical  committee  will  be \nestablished to oversee implementation of the program cluster. Both committees will be chaired \nby Deputy Human Resources and Cultural Affairs, BAPPENAS, and include representatives \nfrom  all  relevant  ministries  (MOF,  MOH,  MONE,  MORA,  MOWE,MOHA  and  BPS)  with \nresponsibilities related to the attainment of the MDGs. BAPPENAS will be the executing agency \nfor coordinating the implementation of the PRMAP and will establish an executive secretariat. \nThe line ministries responsible for the various sectors will be the implementing agencies and will \nestablish sectoral technical committees and secretariats for the education and health sectors.  \n  2.  Implementation Period \n108.  The implementation period for SP1 is from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007. All actions \nincluded in the policy matrix under SP1 have been implemented during this time frame. The \nprogram period for SP2 is from 1 April 2007 to 30 March 2009, while that of SP3 will cover the \nperiod from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011. The timeframe of SP1 and SP2 is consistent with \nthe  implementation  period  of  the  RPJM  and  the  recently  approved  education  and  health \nmedium-term development plans. This time frame is also consistent with the ADB CSP 2006\u2013\n2009, which includes MDG acceleration as one of its core areas of support. SP3 will build on the \nresults of SP1 and SP2 and will be revised to support the new RPJM, which is to be prepared \nby the Government in 2009. The duration of the program loan is considered appropriate to \nreach the policy reform objectives of PRMAP. \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement   \n109. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans.54 The SP1 loan of $400 million will be released in a single tranche upon \nloan effectiveness. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, the \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required, if the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan disbursed during the given year. \nThe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. The PRMAP will \nprovide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by the Government 180 days prior to \nloan  effectiveness.  The  Borrower  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  in  principle  of  the \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance this program.  \n4.  Anticorruption \n110.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and all relevant ADB guidelines, including the Procurement Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and the loan regulations, was specifically brought to the notice of \n                                                \n54 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. ", "30\nthe  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. The Government has \nconsiderably strengthened its anticorruption efforts since late 2004. The reforms adopted as \npart  of  PRMAP  will  reduce  the  risk  of  corruption  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  by \nincreasing government transparency in the allocation of resources and improving accountability \nby service providers, local governments and central government ministries. Some of the reforms \ncontributing to the reduction of corruption include: (i) the publication of the summaries of the \nMONE  and  MORA  inspectors  general  audit  reports  in  their  websites;  (ii)  socialization  of \nASKESKIN programs to communities to inform them on available services and entitlements; (iii) \nincreased  transparency  in  the  allocation  of  DAK  funds  for  health  and  education;  (iv) \nstrengthening  of  the  schools  committees  with  increased  women\u2019s  participation;  and  (v) \nincreased availability and transparency on health expenditures though the preparation of NHAs.  \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n111.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive the loan proceeds. The \naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated on terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n112.  MOF and BAPPENAS will be continuously monitoring implementation of the PRMAP and its \nimpact. Reporting on progress will be made by the line ministries, as implementing agencies, to the \nPSC through regular quarterly meetings. BAPPENAS will submit to ADB semi-annual reports until \nthe completion of the program cluster. With ADB TA support, the line ministries reporting system on \nprogress will be strengthened and technical coordination will be provided to resolve problems and \nfacilitate implementation of pending or delayed actions. ADB will be closely involved in the process \nthrough  TA  as  well  as  policy  dialogue,  and  its  inputs  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Government. \nBAPPENAS and ADB will jointly assess the impact and evaluate the benefits of SP1 within 12 \nmonths after completion. Findings from the consultations and reviews will be utilized in ensuring \ncontinuity and sustained progress of SP1 reforms under SP2 and SP3. \nV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n113.  The impact of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen social service \ndelivery at the national level through the implementation of national policy reforms in health and \neducation. The TA outcome will be to sustain the reforms introduced under SP1, and refine and \nassist the Government to achieve the national policy reforms included under SP2. It will support \nBAPPENAS,  MONE,  MORA,  MOH,  and  MOWE  to  implement  these  reforms.  The  TA  is \ndesigned to be flexible, allowing the Government to develop outputs, terms of reference, and \nbudgets for individual components based on current needs and demand. The TA will coordinate \nand complement ADB and other donor-supported decentralized programs in poverty, gender, \neducation and health, to ensure that lessons can be applied to the TA for accelerating MDG \nachievement in a holistic way. ", "31\n114.  The TA will result in 10 outputs grouped under three components. Component 1 will \nsupport  cross-sectoral  policy  reforms  by  assisting  Government  agencies  to:  (i)  develop \nrecommendations for strengthening the DAK technical guidelines for the education and health \nsectors, (ii) finalize a list of selected sex-disaggregated MDG health and education indicators, and \n(iii) develop a national MDG roadmap, and prepare guidelines on mainstreaming MDGs into \ndistrict  medium-term  development  plans  and  poverty  reduction  strategies.  Component  2  will \nsupport reforms in the education sector by: (i) assessing the effectiveness of different strategies \nand programs in meeting the basic education objectives of the Grand Design for Basic Education \nand assisting these ministries in the development of policy proposals, and (ii) demonstrating the \nuse of the \u201cCitizens Report Card\u201d (CRC) for education, used for surveying parents on their \nsatisfaction with service delivery to improve accountability and education quality. Component 3 \nwill support reforms in the health sector by: (i) reviewing and improving the criteria used for \ncentrally provided budget allocations for MNCH and CDC activities; (ii) supporting analysis and \ndevelopment  of  recommendations  for  the  revision  of  the  ASKESKIN  program  design  and \nimplementation modalities; (iii) preparing an evaluation of (a) contract provider payment-schemes, \nincluding in particular their impact on the distribution of providers in poor and remote areas, and \n(b) utilization of MNCH and CDC services, particularly by women; (iv) assisting in the revision of a \nministerial regulation regarding health-related MSSs; and (v) contributing to developing a NHAs \nprogram.  \n115.  The TA will be implemented in parallel with the PRMAP and will cover a period of 20 \nmonths, from 1 January 2008 to 31 August 2009. The total cost of the TA is estimated at \n$2,700,000. ADB will finance $1,500,000 from its TA funding program, and the Government will \nprovide counterpart support in the amount of $200,000 equivalent. AusAID will provide about \n$1,000,000  parallel  cofinancing  to  support  health  sector  reforms.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the \nexecuting agency and the line ministries responsible for the various sectors will act as the \nimplementing agencies. The PSC established for PRMAP will also coordinate implementation of \nthe TA. A team of international specialists (46 person-months) and national experts (31 person-\nmonths), supported by ADB, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, following the quality- and cost-based selection method and using a full technical \nproposal. A team of international specialists (total 30 person-months) and national experts (40 \nperson-months), supported by AusAID on a parallel basis, will be recruited on an individual \nbasis. The TA is presented in Appendix 8. The terms of reference for consulting services are in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n116.  The key benefits expected from PRMAP are (i) the acceleration of the attainment of the \nMDGs; (ii) sustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term poverty reduction and \nsocial development objectives, as articulated in the RPJM, the SNPK, and the national sector \nstrategies for the health and education sectors; (iii) reorientation of public expenditure to the \nsocial sectors; (iv) an improved decentralization framework for provision of social services; (v) \nreduction of regional disparities; and (vi) increased access to and enhanced quality, efficiency, \nand accountability of education and health services for the poor. \n117. Institutional Impacts. The PRMAP will strengthen the institutional framework for the \nsocial  sectors  and  assist  in  developing  inter-sectoral  linkages  and  networks  to  overcome \ntraditional  institutional  barriers  across  ministries,  and  between  central  and  local  government \nagencies. Within the education sector, institutional coordination between MONE and MORA will \nimprove due to the preparation of a joint strategic plan (the Grand Design for Basic Education). In \nthe health sector the role of PT Askes as a provider of health insurance will be enhanced. At the ", "32\ndistrict level, the roles and responsibilities of local governments with respect to social sector \ndelivery will be clarified. The increased role of women in district education boards and school \ncommittees is expected to increase institutional capacity at the community level. \n118. Policy Impacts. PRMAP will assist in raising public awareness regarding the MDGs, \npromote study and debate around the development challenges facing the country, forge stronger \nalliances among diverse groups, renew political commitment and help the Government and its \ndevelopment  partners  create  deeper  and  better-financed  partnerships.  It  will  help  focus  the \nnational debate on specific development priorities related to the poor and vulnerable, which in turn \nwill trigger action in terms of policy reforms, institutional change and resource allocation. The \nprogram will also provide for policy continuity and consistency in areas in which ADB has been \nactively involved. \n119. Social Impacts. The PRMAP supports improved access and equity of social services for \nthe poor and women. The program will contribute to reducing sharp regional and socioeconomic \ndifferentials in selected education and health indicators. It will also contribute to a reduction in \nmaternal mortality by improving access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care, antenatal \ncare, and family planning services, and lower infant and child mortality rates by increasing \nimmunization coverage. Improved CDC (targeting, for example, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB) will \nalso contribute to lowering maternal and child mortality. In education, better access to schools \nand  the  removal  of  fees  will  likely  result  in  improved  transition  rates  to  junior  secondary \neducation. Higher enrollment and transition rates will result in reduced child labor as children \ndelay their entrance to the labor market to obtain more education. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n120. Gender  Impacts.  Accelerating  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  will \ndirectly benefit women through the promotion of gender equity. An increased focus on achieving \nthe MDGs requires designing interventions that target improvements in women\u2019s health and \neducation (e.g., achieving universal primary education, reaching gender parity in primary and \nsecondary education, reducing maternal and infant mortality, and reducing HIV/AIDS). The policy \nmeasures under PRMAP will improve (i) girls access to junior secondary education through, \namong  others,  integrated  schools  and  scholarship  schemes;  and  (ii)  access  by  females  to \naffordable maternal and reproductive health services through increased financing and technical \nimprovements to the ASKESKIN program. PRMAP also supports policy changes to increase the \nproportion of female representatives on district education boards and school committees to 40%. \nImproved and more efficient delivery of basic education and health services will result in reducing \nthe  opportunity  cost  of  women\u2019s  time,  improving  the  health  and  nutrition  status  of  families, \nlowering fertility, and reducing future gender disparities. \n121. Economic and Poverty Impacts. The nature of PRMAP, as a policy reform program, \ndoes not lend itself to a quantitative financial and economic analysis. Nevertheless, it is evident \nthat major economic benefits will accrue to the entire population through measures that aim to \nexpand the scope and improve access to and the quality and governance of basic social sector \nservices, particularly for the poor. Improved access to basic education will increase productivity \nand personal income of poor families in the long run. Access to affordable health services and \nto health insurance will increase productivity and protect the poor from catastrophic health risks, \nwhich can exacerbate poverty. PRMAP will contribute to the development of human resources \nto better equip the population to seize the opportunities generated by rapid economic growth. It \nwill  also  have  a  positive  impact  on  employment  by  increasing  the  number  of  healthcare \nproviders  (e.g.,  midwives)  through  improved  reimbursement  procedures  of  the  ASKESKIN \nprogram and improving recruitment and deployment of teachers. The introduction of MSSs and ", "33\nperformance-based allocation of resources will make social services more responsive to local \npreferences, and service providers more accountable to their clients, increasing efficiency. \n122. Social and Environmental Safeguards. A desk review was undertaken to assess the \nimpact of the PRMAP policy measures and the TA on land acquisition and resettlement, the \nenvironment, and ethnic groups, in accordance with ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguard \npolicies (i.e., the Involuntary Resettlement Policy [1995], Policy on Indigenous Peoples [1998], \nand Environment Policy [2002]). The PRMAP and TA are unlikely to have any adverse impacts \non ethnic groups, resettlement or environment.  \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n123.  The PRMAP is subject to the following risks: \n(i) Limited impact on education and health outcomes. Overall increased public \nexpenditure  in  the  sectors  may  have  limited  effect  in  improving  education \noutcomes if the funds are not utilized efficiently or fail to reach the intended \nbeneficiaries.  Increased  budget  allocation  for  education  and  health  from  the \nGovernment may encourage local governments to reduce their own allocations. \nThe  introduction  of  performance-based  allocation  mechanisms  and  improved \nsystems for monitoring outcomes will mitigate these risks. \n(ii) Corruption and poor governance. PRMAP may face constraints in the form of \nweak governance and corruption. However, the Government has considerably \nstrengthened its anti-corruption efforts in recent years. The profile and visibility of \nthe anti-corruption commission and other law enforcement agencies have now \nbeen considerably enhanced to deal with corruption. The strengthening of school \ncommittees  and  increased  transparency  and  accountability  mechanisms \nintroduced  under  the  ASKESKIN  program  will  improve  governance  in  the \neducation and health sectors. \n(iii)  Resistance  to  the  policy  reforms  by  local  governments  and  lack  of \ncapacity. Lack of clarity about the obligations of each level of government in the \ndelivery of social services could pose obstacles for the implementation of the \nreforms  at  the  local  level.  Recent  steps  taken  to  further  clarify  these \nresponsibilities  through  the  establishment  of  minimum  services  standards  is \nexpected to mitigate this risk. There is also a risk that local governments will fail \nto  support  reforms  that  increase  their  accountability  and  impose  further \nmonitoring of their policies and actions. Lack of capacity by local governments to \nimplement reforms is also a risk. Current support provided to districts by ongoing \nADB projects to improve capacity for implementation of health and education \nprograms is expected to reduce these risks. \n(iv)  External and domestic economic shocks may affect the sustainability of \nthe reforms: Increased oil prices or other adverse regional or domestic events \nthat have a contagion effect could reduce the fiscal space available for the \nimplementation of the reforms. Efforts taken by the Government to balance the \nbudget and improve economic management have reduced this risk. \n(v)  Government commitment to MDGs. A lack of government commitment could \nreduce the momentum for policy reforms focused on accelerated achievement of \nthe MDGs. However, Government actions indicate strong commitment to poverty \nreduction and the MDG acceleration agenda in the medium term.  ", "34\nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \nA.  Specific Assurances \n124.  In  addition  to  the  standards  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used \nto finance the development needs as outlined under the PRMAP implementation \narrangements. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the PRMAP loan agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of the PRMAP and subsequently. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n125.  All reform actions and measures, as specified in the Policy Matrix for Subprogram I, \nhave been carried out. \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n126.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the program cluster to the Republic of Indonesia for the Poverty Reduction and \nMillennium Development Goals Acceleration Program;  \n(ii)  the loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for Subprogram 1 of the \nPoverty Reduction and Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Program \nCluster, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 \non  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of  Indonesia  for  Strengthening  Social \nServices Delivery. \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident\n4 October 2007 ", "Appendix 1  35\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources/ \nDesign Performance Assumptions \nReporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact Assumption \nTo accelerate progress  By 2015, have attained the  Central Board of  (cid:120)  Macroeconomic \ntowards achieving the MDGs  following progress towards the  Statistics (BPS) data  and political \nin education (MDG 2), and  MDG targets:   stability\nhealth (MDG 4\u20136) and  (cid:120)  Proportion of population  MOF Risks\ncontribute to poverty  below the national poverty  (cid:120)  Lack of effective \nreduction (MDG 1), and  line: 7.6%  Data from the  coordination \ngender equality (MDG 3)  (cid:120)  Net enrolment ratio of 95%  Program Steering  between the \nin primary education and  Committee (PSC)  concerned line \n80% in junior secondary  ministries and \n(cid:120)  Ratio of girls to boys in basic  MONE and MORA  local\neducation: 100%  governments \n(cid:120)  Under-5 mortality rate per  MOH (cid:120)  External and \n1000 births: 32  domestic \n(cid:120)  Maternal mortality rate per  economic \n100,000 live births: 102  shocks may \n(cid:120)  Malaria prevalence rate per  affect the \n100,000 people: less than  sustainability of \n1000 the reforms \n(cid:120)  HIV prevalence among \npregnant women: less than \n0.04\n(cid:120)  Tuberculosis prevalence rate \nper 100,000 people: less \nthan 200 \nOutcome By 2012:  PSC reports  Assumption \nImproved access, equity, and  (cid:120)  Proportion of births attended  (cid:120)  Low corruption \nquality of service delivery in  by skilled health personnel  BPS data  and good \nthe education and health  increased from 72% to 85%  governance \nsectors to accelerate  (cid:120)  Difference in per capita  MONE and MORA  Risk\nprogress toward the MDGs  expenditure for health and  (cid:120)  Increased \neducation between the  government \npoorest and the richest  MOH and PT Askes  expenditures \nquintile of districts reduced  have limited \nby 10%  Local government  impact on \n(cid:120)  Proportion of funds from  reports  outcomes  \neducation and health \nprograms reaching the poor \nincreased by 20% \n(cid:120)  Female illiteracy rate \nreduced by 30% \n(cid:120)  Utilization of public health \nservices by the poor \nincreased by 30%  \n(cid:120)  Net enrolment ratio of poor \nin junior secondary \nincreased from 50% to 65%  ", "36 Appendix 1 \nData Sources/ \nDesign Performance Assumptions \nReporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs By 2011:  Assumption \n(cid:120)  Government \nI.

Indonesia\u2019s performance relative to the education-related Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 2 of universal basic education by 2015 is mixed, although it has made good progress \nwith respect to some intermediate indicators at the national level. Indonesia, which has one of \nthe largest school-going populations in the world (Table A3.1), has been more ambitious than \nmost countries striving to meet the international target of universal basic education. Indonesia \nhas defined basic education as including a total of 9 years: 6 years of primary education (7\u201312 \nyear olds) and 3 years of junior secondary education (13\u201315 year olds). In an impressive \nachievement, access to education, as measured by gross enrolment rates (GERs) and net \nenrolment rates (NERs), has improved nationally at all levels. In 2005, the GER and NER at the \nprimary level were 114.6% and 94.0% respectively, while those for junior secondary level were \n82.9% and 63.7% (Table A3.2). These enrolment rates, especially at the primary level, compare \nfavorably with enrolment rates in East Asian countries with much higher per capita incomes.  \nTable A3.1: Population of School Aged Children\n(million)\nNational  Population 0\u20136  Population  Population 13\u201315  Population 16\u201318 \nPopulation  Years Old  7\u201312 (Primary)  (Junior Secondary)  Senior Secondary  \n220   28.5  25.60  13.03  12.66 \nSource: Ministry of National Education. 2005.

One of the key limitations of NERs, however, is that they do not translate automatically \ninto  school  attendance  or  completion. Additionally,  even  if  a  cohort  analysis of  those  that \ncomplete basic education is undertaken, focusing on those who remain in school and complete \na certain level of education fails to take into account overall system inefficiencies resulting from \nrepetition and dropouts. Moreover, a recent study1 shows that even in those countries that are \non track to meet the MDGs, the majority of youth do not meet minimal competency levels, let \nalone the level of competency required in a globalized environment. \n                                                \n1  Filmer, Dan, Amer Hasan, and Lant Pritchett. 2006.

This analysis is very relevant for Indonesia. Despite impressive GERs and NERs, only \nabout half of Indonesian children enrolled in school complete basic education within the required \n9 years. A recent study2 shows that the dropout rate for primary school level students was \n1.68% in secular schools and 2.26% for madrasah. At the junior secondary level, the rates \nincreased  to  2.65%  and  3.55%  for  secular  and  religious  schools,  respectively.  GER-\ndisaggregated data reveal higher dropout rates for male students as the level of education \nincreases; dropout rates for male students are higher than for females, particularly at the junior \nsecondary level. (See Table A3.3). \nTable A3.3: Dropout Rates (%) \nDrop-Out Rate Grade I\u2013VI \nLevel and Type of School \nMale Female  Total \nPrimary School (secular) \n  Urban   1.26 0.99 1.16\n  Rural  2.28 1.90 2.09\n  Subtotal  1.82 1.48 1.68\nPrimary School (religious) \n  Urban   2.70 3.11 2.89\n  Rural  3.18 3.31 3.25\n  Subtotal  2.64 2.65 2.65\nJunior Secondary (secular) \n  Urban  2.09 1.36 1.74\n  Rural  4.13 2.90 3.58\n   Subtotal  3.09 2.12 2.65\nJunior Secondary (religious) \n  Urban 4.41 2.53 3.34\n  Rural 5.86 3.16 4.85\nSubtotal 4.43 2.43 3.55\nSource: Ghozali. 2004.

Disparities in access to education continue to exist at the post\u2013primary level among \nprovinces, among rural and urban areas within provinces, between those children attending \nreligious schools and those attending public schools, and between the rich and the poor (Table \nA3.4). Key factors affecting enrolment and transition rates include substantial cost barriers (e.g. \nfees, transport cost, textbooks, stationary, and uniforms), uneven coverage of facilities, and \nperceptions about the relevance of the curriculum and future employability of school graduates.  \nTable A3.4: NER by Income Quintile \nQ1(poorest)  Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5( richest) Q5/Q1\nPrimary         \n1993  86.7  90.7  92.5 93.3 93.0  1.07 \n1997  90.3  93.0  93.4 93.5 92.4  1.02 \n2002  91.4  93.6  93.8 93.2 91.4  1.00 \nJunior Secondary     \n1993  22.6  37.5  45.7 61.3 72.5  3.21 \n1997  37.7  52.2  60.0 69.2 75.1  1.99 \n2002  45.5  57.9  65.1 72.0 76.9  1.69 \nSource: Ministry of Education. 2004.

Therefore, meeting the MDG 2 target of universal basic education3 by 2015 depends not \nonly upon the steady increase in NERs at both the primary and junior secondary levels, but also \non completion rates at these levels. Existing urban-rural disparities within districts and income-\nrelated disparities at the post\u2013primary levels pose significant challenges to the attainment of \nMDG 2. Children who do not complete primary education are especially at risk of becoming \nilliterate adults. \n6.  Indonesia is on track to meet the MDG 3 target of eliminating gender disparity in primary \nand secondary education by 2015. An impressive achievement for Indonesia is that the gender \ngap in terms of NER has been eliminated at the primary level and reversed for the junior \nsecondary levels,4 where there were more girls enrolled than boys (64.5% vs. 62.6%) in 2003 \n(Table 3.5). At the senior secondary level, the NER for girls (40.6%) in 2003 was almost the \nsame that for boys (40.5%). In addition, the general observation\u2014that the poorer the family, the \nlower the proportion of girls enrolled in school and the higher the dropout rate for girls\u2014does not \nhold true for Indonesia at all levels of schooling.\nTable A3.5: Net Enrolment Rates, by Gender, Urban and Rural 2003 \nEducation Level  Male  Female \nUrban  Rural  Total  Urban  Rural  Total \nPrimary  92.3  92.6  92.5  92.0  93.0  92.6 \nJunior Secondary  72.5  56.2  62.6  73.0  58.8  64.5 \nSenior Secondary  56.9  28.5  40.5  55.2  29.0  40.6 \nTertiary  16.0  2.2  8.8  14.9  2.1  8.3 \nSources: Central Board of Statistics (BPS). 2003; and National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS). 2003. \n7.  While the gender gap in terms of adult literacy rates has been narrowing steadily, due to \nfaster improvements in the literacy rates of females than those of males, the literacy rate of \nwomen (86.2%) is still lower than that of men (93.5%). Women also have lower mean years of \nschooling (6.5 years) than do men (7.6 years). The Government is promoting female literacy \nthrough non-formal education programs. In addition, increasing completion of basic education \nwill by default lower illiteracy levels in the future.  \n2.  Analysis of Institutional Capacity, Resource Allocation and Governance for \nEducation Sector Development in support of MDGs \na.  Institutional Capacity \n8.  Decentralization  has  led  to  changed  and  still-evolving  roles  for  education  sector \nmanagement. The political and administrative decentralization undertaken within Indonesia in \n2001 has posed some challenges for policy formulation and service delivery for the education \nsector. While general public education service delivery has been made the obligatory function of \nlocal  governments,  with  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  responsible  for  policy \ndevelopment and resource allocation, the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA), a central level \nagency, continues to be responsible for delivering religious education. In addition, the role and \ncoordination among different agencies\u2014such as Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional \n(the National Development Planning Agency, BAPPENAS) in policy formulation, the Ministry of \nHome  Affairs  (MOHA)  in  regulation,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  performance  based \nresource allocation, as well as the Board of National Education Standards (BSNP)\u2014are still \n                                                \n3  While internationally, the MDG for basic education refers to 5 years of education, Indonesia has been more \nambitious in defining its basic education to include both primary (grades 1\u20136) and secondary (grades 7\u20139). \n4  ADB. 2006.

", "46 Appendix 3\nevolving. Increased clarity with respect to the role of each agency in the education sector will \nlead to improved management and sector performance.  \n9. Managing  Education  Initiatives.  Positive  initiatives  are  underway  for  improving \neducation quality, efficiency, and effectiveness, but need to be managed well. The Government \nis acutely aware of the need to establish standards of education and raise attainment levels for \nthese standards through improved teacher qualifications as well as the provision of adequate \ntextbooks and other learning materials. While additional teachers will be needed to replace \nretirees, the deployment of teachers within districts and the weak expertise of teachers in \npriority subject areas such as math and science are much greater problems.  \n10. While the establishment of BSNP and the development of national education standards \nand minimum service standards (MSSs) has been long overdue, there is a danger that districts \nbe  overwhelmed  if  all  MSSs  are  implemented  simultaneously,  if  the  number  of  MSSs  is \nexcessive, and if the effort to impose standards is too ambitious. It is therefore important that \nimplementation  of  the  MSSs  be  well  sequenced.  Proper  implementation  of  the  national \neducation standards would require (i) sufficient funding; (ii) understanding of what needs to get \ndone at the school level; and (iii) cooperation between MONE, MORA, MOHA, BAPPENAS, \nMOF and local governments. \n11. The Government is also aware of the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \neducation service delivery. In the aggregate, government financing for education is allocated \nefficiently,  as  funds  are  directed  primarily  to  improve  enrolment  levels  and  the  quality  of \noutcomes at the primary and junior secondary levels. The allocative and technical efficiency of \nprimary and junior secondary spending could be further enhanced through (i) the reassignment \nof teachers across geographic areas, and (ii) adjustment of the Bantuan Operasional Sekolah \n(BOS) formula to take into account school size. Technical efficiency could also be improved by \nmeeting  education  standards  for  average  class  size  and  average  hours  of  instruction.  In \naddition, decisions related to investments in teacher quality would also need to be reflected in \nthe technical quality of education. \n12. Aligning MONE and MORA Policies. Central MONE and MORA policies and strategies \nneed to be better aligned to support the RPJM as well as district education development plans. \nThe Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan for 2005\u20132009 (RPJM) is characterized by \na strong focus on policies and programs for social justice, equity and quality of basic social \nservices. Recognizing the need for urgent policy reform, MONE and MORA have conducted \ncomprehensive sector performance assessments and developed medium-term plans.5 Although \nboth ministries are governed by the National Education Law of 2003, they formulated separate \neducation strategic plans. Recent measures have sought to better align their policies, strategies \nand operations in support of education service delivery at the district level, and include the \ndevelopment of a joint strategic plan for basic education. In addition, these agencies need to \nsupport district governments in developing comprehensive education development plans based \non an assessment of performance in terms of education outcomes and strategies to reduce \ndisparities.  \n13.  There continue to be tremendous opportunities for organizational restructuring within the \ncentral government and retraining at all levels of government for improved planning, financing \nand  implementation  of  education  services,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policies. Local government capacity for service delivery remains particularly \nweak. While the provision of basic education services is now an obligatory function of district \n                                                \n5  MONE.  2005.

", "Appendix 3  47\ngovernments,  it  is  quite  evident  that  management  capacity,  in  terms  of  the  systems  and \npersonnel in place at the district level, is inadequate to perform the expected functions. A \nnumber of development partners, including ADB, are currently providing technical assistance \n(TA) to raise the managerial, technical and financial management capacities at the district and \nschool levels.\n14. Revival  of  Management  Information  Systems.  One  detrimental  aspect  of \ndecentralization in the short term has been the breakdown in data flows from local to central \nlevel, and the loss of skilled personnel to manage information systems. These weaknesses \nhave  greatly  impeded  sector-level  planning  for  and  performance  monitoring  of  education \nservices. Similarly, information management systems at the district level are insufficiently user \nfriendly  and  not  results-oriented,  which  undermines  the  operational  planning  and  service \nmanagement functions of local governments. These systems need to be revived and made \nfunctional to direct increasing education sector resources to MDG-deficit areas. In addition, \nschool mapping needs to be made more participatory to allow for greater understanding of the \nsocioeconomic and cultural factors that promote or impede the use of education facilities, and to \npromote greater responsibility for the use of school services by communities. \nb.  Education Sector Resources \n15. Medium-term Education Expenditure Framework. Government spending on education is \nrising, but an overall medium-term expenditure framework with clear roles for the Government and \nother stakeholders in education financing is needed. In order to implement the education reform \nprogram, national public expenditure on education is projected to rise from Rp42.3 trillion to around \nRp131 trillion (in nominal terms) over the period 2005\u20132007. Approved centrally managed education \nexpenditure is projected to rise from Rp24 trillion to Rp65 trillion over 2005\u20132009. In order to avoid \nany fiscal gap, regional budgets for education will need to increase from around Rp40 trillion to \nRp51 trillion over the same period. Community spending is projected to remain roughly constant at \naround Rp10 trillion over the same period, with a rapidly increasing share at post-basic levels.  \n16.  Central expenditure for formal basic education is projected to rise from Rp12.1 trillion in \n2005  to  Rp19.7  trillion  by  2009,  including  (i)  school  operational  budgets,  (ii)  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and (iii) scholarships for the poor. Consistent with Government priorities, expenditure \non teacher management and quality assurance will rise from Rp3.2 trillion to Rp9.6 trillion over the \nsame period. Central expenditure on non-formal education is projected to increase from Rp0.3 \ntrillion to Rp4.6 trillion by 2009.  \n17.  The new education financing strategy is expected to increase the volume and share of \ncentral government education expenditure within the poorest and currently underserved areas \nof  Indonesia.  A  critical  financing policy  issue  is  to  ensure  that  increased  levels  of  central \ngovernment spending on education (e.g. due to the teachers law and BOS) does not lead to \nlower levels of spending on basic education by local governments. \n18.  It is now necessary, however, to shift from simply increasing education financing to a \ngreater focus on increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Improving allocative and cost efficiency \nis of particular importance in the context of Indonesia, where the Constitution mandates that \n20% of the national budget will be allocated for (non-salary) education expenditures. Financial \ninvestments  to  increase  student  retention  and  transition  and  reduce  dropouts  can  lead  to \ngreater effectiveness but lower education system efficiency. These critical issues need to be \nexplored by the Government to inform policies for financing education. \n19. Increasing Education Access and Transition Rates. Infrastructure development is \nbeing designed to help increase access to as well as transition rates among different levels of ", "48 Appendix 3\neducation. Achieving the MDGs requires getting the last 2.6% of primary (7 to 12 years old) and \n16% junior secondary (13 to 15 years old) school-aged children into school. The large stock of \nprimary schools built in the 1970s needs to be rehabilitated, while expansion and rehabilitation \nis needed at the junior secondary level. In order to increase transition rates, the Government \nhas adopted the policy of \u201cone roof\u201d or integrated schools, under which primary schools will be \nupgraded and/or expanded to enroll children at junior secondary levels.  \n20. Linking  Remuneration  and  Outcomes.  Considerable  investments  are  planned  for \nupgrading the skills of and incentives for teachers and education personnel, but these need to \ntranslate into improved practices and performance at the school level. The implementation of \nthe  new  Teachers  and  Education  Personnel  law,  approved  in  December  2005,  will  have \nsignificant  medium-  to  long-term  implications  for  education  financing.  In  broad  terms,  the \nlegislation provides, by 2016, for a doubling of the remuneration of teachers through incentive \nawards, and for professional upgrading through education and certification. The challenge will \nbe to ensure that any increases in teacher remuneration are linked to gains in (i) efficiency, (ii) \nteacher  performance,  and  (iii)  subsequent  improved  student  outcomes  and  standards. \nUpgrading of teacher skills will need to be managed carefully in integrated schools to ensure a \nbalance between increased work loads and professional development requirements. \n21. Results of Operational Funding Support. Recent operational support funding programs \nfor  schools  by  the  central  Government  have  had  mixed  results.  Provision  of  resources  for \nrecurrent  expenditures  at  the  school  level\u2014including  student  activities,  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure and equipment, and other administrative expenses\u2014are the responsibility of district \ngovernments. However, the budget allocated by districts for these activities has historically been \nvery small, averaging less than 5% for public primary schools, and less than 10% for public junior \nsecondary schools. This was a primary reason why almost all public schools needed to solicit \nparental contributions to close the gap between funding requirements and the resources made \navailable from the district government. Poorer communities with limited resources to contribute \ntherefore ended up with poorly funded schools. \n22.  The situation has been improving, however. The reduction in fuel subsidies in 2005 led \nto the launching that year by the Government of a school operational support program, based \non the number of students per school (the BOS program). An early assessment of the program \nhighlighted implementation challenges, and the risk that increased central-government spending \ncould result in further spending reductions by districts. As a result there could be limited growth \nin  total  public  sector  resources,  with  negative  consequences  for  policy  implementation, \nespecially in terms of quality and standards improvement.   \n23.  While the BOS program has increased overall resources for schools accessed by very \npoor communities, and allows school principals the discretion to offer financial support to poor \nstudents, this may be negated by other solicitations for financial support from parents. Some \ncommunities are still being asked to make financial contributions which take creative forms, such \nas \u201cseat\u201d fees and fines imposed on students, with negative consequences for the students\u2019 \naccess to and retention within the education system. The Government is therefore piloting a \nconditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme, to stimulate demand for basic education by the poor and \ncomplement current programs.  \nc.  Education Sector Governance and Accountability for Outcomes \n24. Education Quality. Education outcomes, as measured by international programs that \nassess student skills and learning achievement across countries, confirm the low quality of ", "Appendix 3  49\neducation in Indonesia.6 Even with the low graduating standard currently in use (i.e. a 42.25% \npass score), many students do not pass. In the 2006 national exam, 8.6% of vocational high \nschool and 7.43% of senior high school students did not pass, although there was a marked \nimprovement in the average scores of those that did pass. Student examination performance \nvaries widely across districts. In 2006, pass rates in junior secondary examinations averaged \n92%, with a provincial range of 64.7% to 94.3%. Pass rates in poorer, rural and remote areas \nwere  consistently  below  average.  These  results  call  for  measures  to  improve  the  student \nassessment and learning techniques employed in schools. \n25.  There is strong evidence of high-level leadership and ownership of the education reform \nprogram in Indonesia that seeks to improve these sector outcomes. The minister of national \neducation has led the formulation of the new education reform program for MONE (RENSTRA \n2005\u20132009), and a joint strategy between MONE and MORA was completed in 2006. The \nreforms are based on an extensive and inclusive public consultation process in five regions \nduring  2005,  as  well  as  intensive  consultation  with  the  parliamentary  working  group  on \neducation. Vice President Yusuf Kalla has indicated strong government commitment to ensuring \nthat  all  primary  schools  and  madrasah  are  repaired  and  renovated  within  the  current \nGovernment's mandate. Consistent with President Susulo Bambang Yudhoyono\u2019s commitment \nto governance reform, the ministry of education has set a number of measurable anti-corruption \nperformance indicators in the education RENSTRA.7\n26.  While the support given to reforming education services, which includes vital financial \nsupport,  makes  it  considerably  easier  to  examine  the  systemic  weaknesses  and  devise \nstrategies to address these, there is currently no regular process within the government for \nmonitoring  the  effectiveness  of  education  policies  and  strategies.  The  Government  has \nembarked on a program to encourage district education development planning as well as school \ndevelopment planning, with regular reporting on the use of funds being submitted to the school \ncommittees and the district education boards, along with annual budget hearings at district and \nnational legislatures. Despite these initiatives, none of these bodies are yet evaluating the \nappropriateness of legislation, regulations and policies independently of the executive, which \nshould be their primary role in a decentralized environment. Regular budget hearings that \nexamine progress towards achievement of national and international targets such as the MDGs \nwould make the process truly results\u2013oriented, and help the executive focus on the outcomes \nfor which they are ultimately accountable. \n27.  Another  challenge  for  improving  education  sector  governance  is  the  lack  of  clear \ndelineation of responsibilities among the central, provincial and local governments; although the \nNational Education Law 20/2003 provides some broad assignment of responsibility, it remains \nopen to interpretation, which has led to a plethora of implementing regulations from different \ncentral government agencies, as well as district governments. \nB.

Program for International Student Assessment. Manila for 15-year olds. Indonesia ranked \n39th in reading and mathematics, and 38th, out of 41 countries, in science.  \n7  These include targets for: (i) number of anticorruption charges, (ii) amounts of funds subject to anticorruption \ninvestigation, and (iii) amount of funds subject to reclaim. ", "50 Appendix 3\ndropping between 1970 and 2004 from 97 to 38 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 live births. \nMany factors, both within and outside the health sector, explain Indonesia\u2019s progress during this \nperiod in reducing child mortality. However, sharp regional and socioeconomic differentials \nremain in child mortality, and progress could be more rapid with improved performance in \nimmunization,  malaria  control,  water  and  sanitation  and  maternal-child  nutrition,  and  with \nimproved quality and accessibility of maternal neonatal and child health (MNCH) services. \n29. MDG 5. The MDG 5 target on maternal mortality is not likely to be achieved by 2015 \ngiven current progress. Although considerable progress appears to have been made toward \nachieving the MDG 5 target, progress to date has not been sufficiently rapid to indicate that this \ntarget is likely to be achieved by 2015. The estimated maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has \ndeclined from 390 to 307 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births between 1991 and 2002. \nDuring the period 1992 to 2005, the percentage of births assisted by skilled health personnel \n(an important MDG 5 intermediate outcome indicator) has increased from 40.7% to 72.0%. \nHowever, there are still sharp regional and socioeconomic differentials in this indicator, and 42% \nof rural births are still assisted by traditional birth attendants. If Indonesia is to attain the targeted \ndecline  in  the  MMR,  and  achieve  significant  decreases  in  child  mortality  (MDG  4),  more \nemphasis is needed on delivering in health facilities (hospitals, primary health centers or private \nmaternity clinics) instead of in homes; home births currently account for at least 59% of all \nbirths.\n30. MDG 6. Several targets on communicable disease control\u2014of HIV/AIDS and malaria\u2014\nare not likely to be achieved by 2015 given current progress. Indonesia is not on track to \nachieve  the  communicable  disease  control  MDG  targets.  Currently,  the  HIV  epidemic  is \nconcentrated in a few high-prevalence groups (i.e., commercial sex workers and injected drug \nusers). The challenge is to prevent its further spread into the general population. Condom use \nwith high-risk partners is still low, while comprehensive correct knowledge about HIV/AIDS is \nstill limited to the better educated, including among youth. Unless more effective measures are \ntaken in the future, it is unlikely that Indonesia will have halted and begun to reverse the spread \nof HIV/AIDS by 2015. \n31.  Reliable information about malaria incidence is currently unavailable in Indonesia because \nof the poor condition of the national health information system and, more importantly, because up \nto 90% of malaria cases are treated outside health facilities (for example, using drugs purchased \nover the counter). Nearly one-half of Indonesia\u2019s population currently lives in malaria-endemic \nareas. Although bed net coverage is reasonably high (40% of children under 1 year of age were \nreported to have slept under a bed net in 2000), use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor \nspraying are still limited. Unless funding for malaria control is increased significantly in the future, \nit is unlikely that malaria incidence will have begun to decrease by 2015. \n32.  Indonesia currently has one of the highest estimated rates of TB prevalence in the world. \nAlthough the directly observed treatment\u2014short course (DOTS) success rate is currently at the \ntargeted 85%, the DOTS detection rate was only 57% in 2004. Unless the DOTS detection rate \nis increased dramatically in the future, it is unlikely that TB prevalence will have begun to \ndecrease by 2015. \n2.  Health Resources \n33. Underfunding of the Health Sector. Indonesia\u2019s health sector has been under-funded \nfor many years, both by the Government and by households. Government-financed health \nexpenditures averaged less than 3% of total central government expenditure and about 0.5% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during  the  period  1985  to  2002.  Per  capita  public  health \nexpenditure (i.e., central government plus donor-financed health expenditure) ranged between ", "Appendix 3  51\n$2 and $6 during this period. Household-financed health expenditure is estimated to account for \nabout 68% of total health expenditure, implying that per capita total health expenditure averaged \nonly about $12 during this period. Despite recent efforts by the Government to increase public \nexpenditure in the health sector, total public health expenditure remained low, at about 17% of \nGDP in 2006. \n34. Health  Sector  Government  Budgets.  Because  of  the  non-transparent  government \nbudgeting and reporting system, there is little information currently available on the allocation of \nresources within the government health system, either at the central level or in the provinces and \ndistricts. However, the available data suggest that there is substantial variation among provinces \nin per capita levels of public health expenditure that is unrelated to high MMR or infant mortality \nrates.  The  available  data  also  indicate  that  the  allocation  of  central  health  funding  among \nprovinces tends to exacerbate rather than reduce inequalities between provinces in public health \nspending. \n35. Shortages and Misallocation of Health Personnel. Due to chronic under-funding and \na government-wide freeze on civil service employment during the 1990s, the Indonesian health \nsector  faces  an  acute  shortage  of  personnel  compared  to  other  countries  in  the  region. \nMoreover, there is a serious misallocation of health personnel (and especially of doctors) within \nthe government health system. The available evidence suggests that the quality of Indonesia\u2019s \nhealth personnel is rather poor, due to the poor quality of education and training institutions, and \nthe absence of re-licensing and re-certification requirements and effective continuing education \nprograms. Another problem is the mismatch, particularly at the central level, between the skills \nneeded to manage a modern health system and the narrow, mostly medical qualifications of \nexisting MOH staff. \n36. Sparse Government Health Infrastructure. There are relatively few hospital beds per \ncapita,  and  primary  health  centers  serve  relatively  large  populations.  However,  the  limited \ngovernment  health  infrastructure  is  fairly  equally  distributed  among  regions.  There  is  little \ninformation available on the current condition of government health infrastructure, which is still \nmaintained, renovated and replaced through centrally managed transfers, such as the DAK. \n3.  Health Processes \n37. Low Health System Productivity. Productivity of health services is relatively low in \nIndonesia. In addition, productivity levels vary considerably among government health facilities, \nreflecting personnel allocations that are unrelated to actual workloads and generally low levels \nof service utilization. However, productivity is also low in the government health system because \npersonnel are poorly motivated and supervised. In one recent study, for example, it was found \nthat 40% of government health staff in primary health centers were absent from their facilities for \nreasons other than off-site duties. Possible solutions to low productivity include the introduction \nof performance-based incentives by third-party payers (for example, PT Askes) and increased \naccountability of health facilities to the communities they are designed to serve. \n38. Low Health Service Utilization. Utilization rates at most government health facilities \nare low. Community health centers (CHCs) are in competition with many providers (including \nself treatment, other government providers, and even with the private practices of CHC staff) for \nboth curative and preventive care. The CHC is not the preferred source for many types of health \nservices. The quality of care in government health facilities is considered by the population to be \npoor (with, for example, limited access to doctors), staff are frequently absent, and drugs and \nsupplies  are  frequently  out  of  stock.  In  a  2004  household  survey  in  32  districts  of  eight \nprovinces, non-poor households were more than twice as likely to prefer to visit a private doctor \nif seriously ill than to visit a CHC. ", "52 Appendix 3\n39. Weak Accountability to Communities. Local accountability to the communities served \nis  still  weak  within  the  government  health  system.  Limited  community  oversight  of  health \nfacilities exists at the district level. Although there is a national policy to have community \noversight at the sub-district level (i.e., at the level of community health centers), this policy has \nnot yet been widely implemented.\n4.  Health Outputs \n40.  Health services include not only curative and preventive services delivered to individuals, \nbut also important \u201ccollective\u201d services, such as health education, disease surveillance and vector \ncontrol that are delivered to communities. Outputs are generally measured at the facility level \nthrough routine reporting systems. However, because routine reporting systems are weak in \nIndonesia and because of the important role of the private sector, it is necessary to rely on \nhousehold survey data for assessments of both service quality and quantity. \n41. Health  Services  Obtained  from  Public  and  Private  Providers.  Several  types  of \npreventive  care  are  critically  important  to  the  achievement  of  the  health  MDGs,  including \nimmunization (affecting child and maternal mortality, and TB infection among young children), \nantenatal care (affecting maternal and child mortality), obstetric delivery care (affecting maternal \nand  neonatal  mortality),  and  family  planning  (affecting  maternal  and  child  mortality).  In \nIndonesia, all of these services are obtained from both public and private providers, although \nmost immunization is done by public providers. \n42. Varying Quality of Care. Primary health care is provided by a wide range of providers \nin Indonesia, with important differences in access to many types of providers between urban \nand/or suburban and rural areas. In terms of curative care, many Indonesians, especially the \npoor, rely on self treatment using drugs purchased over the counter. Self treatment is a serious \nproblem not only because the quality of care is believed to be poor but also because the \ninappropriate use of drugs contributes to the development of resistant strains of diseases such \nas malaria and TB. Access to medical doctors for primary curative care is mainly limited to \nurban and upper-income Indonesians. Although there is no systematic information available on \nthe  quality  of  either  primary  or  referral  curative  care  in  Indonesia,  the  available  evidence \nsuggests that it is rather poor, apart from that obtained from qualified medical doctors. \n43. Immunization Coverage. Immunization coverage remains high but seems to have been \ndecreased recently from 90% in 1991 to 85% in 2005. There are still sharp regional and \nsocioeconomic differences in immunization rates, stemming in part from higher immunization \ndropout rates among poorer children. \n44. Percentage of Obstetric Deliveries in Health Facilities. Obstetric delivery care is \ncurrently obtained from a range of providers, including traditional birth attendants, with 72%of \ndeliveries assisted by nurses or midwives. The best delivery care is provided in hospitals, health \ncenters or in private maternity clinics (usually operated by private midwives). Poorer quality \ndelivery care is available in women\u2019s homes, where at least 60% of deliveries still occur. In \nrecent years, many home births have been assisted by professionally trained village midwives, \nwho are gradually replacing traditional birth attendants in providing home delivery care. Further \nreductions in maternal and neonatal mortality require that an increasing percentage of deliveries \noccur in health facilities, where services are better and where referral care can be obtained \nrelatively quickly, should the need arise. \n45. Poor Availability and Quality of Family Planning Services. Antenatal care and family \nplanning services are also mainly provided by nurses or midwives. Village midwives currently ", "Appendix 3  53\nprovide about 20% of family planning services. The available evidence (based on information \nprovided by respondents in household surveys) suggests that the quality of both antenatal and \nfamily planning services is poor. Providers tend not to follow standard treatment protocols, \nespecially for less well-educated clients (and probably also for poorer clients). The poor also \nhave reduced access to relatively expensive sterilization services, which are not subsidized by \nthe national family planning program. \n46. Limited Access to Diagnostic Services in Rural Areas. Little information is available \nregarding the quality or accessibility of public and private diagnostic services. However, access \nto diagnostic services is limited in rural areas, as indicated by the fact that only about half of \nreported  malaria  cases  are  confirmed  through  laboratory  testing.  It  is  also  known  that \ngovernment laboratories frequently experience shortages of reagents and other materials, while \nquality assurance systems have not been implemented in most laboratories. \n47. Some Public Health Services are Ineffective. Public health services, including health \neducation, disease surveillance and vector control, have been provided by Indonesia\u2019s public \nhealth system for many years. There has been some success with health education, particularly \nin family planning, but there are also many examples where increased knowledge has not \ntranslated into changed behavior. The available evidence indicates that recent efforts to inform \nthe population (including youth) about HIV/AIDS have not been very effective. Average levels of \nknowledge are low, and there are sharp differences between people with different education \nlevels. Disease surveillance also needs strengthening in relation to HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB.  \n5.  Institutional Capacity \n48. Need for Stewardship Role by Central MOH. Sector management includes health \npolicy, regulation, information and research functions. Overall health policy in Indonesia appears \nto be on the right track (i.e., recognizes a need to focus scarce public resources and to develop \nstrong public-private partnerships). However, it is proving difficult to implement. The two most \nimportant health policy changes in recent years have been the 2001 decentralization and the \nestablishment  of  the  ASKESKIN  (health  fund  for  the  poor)  program.  In  the  case  of \ndecentralization, the MOH has not been very successful to date in shifting its main focus from \nservice delivery (which is now mainly the responsibility of districts) to overall sector stewardship.  \n49. Linking Regulatory Capacity and Policy. Health sector regulation has received some \nattention for many years. However, the development of regulatory capacity and its use as an \neffective policy tool has not been a priority within the health sector. Little use has been made of \nlicensing, certification and other regulatory tools to improve facility and personnel standards.  \n50. Health Information System Strengthening. Government health information systems have \nbeen a weak link in the public health system for many years and have become even weaker since \nthe 2001 decentralization. Consequently, Indonesia has had to rely on household surveys to provide \ninformation on health status and on health service utilization. Unfortunately, this does not meet the \nneeds of programs such as malaria and TB, which need timely local area data on disease incidence \nin order to allocate their resources effectively. The most promising opportunity to strengthen health \ninformation systems is probably through increased reporting by health insurers, especially if health \ninsurance schemes increasingly cover the services of private providers. \nC.  Conclusions \n51. Revise Incentives to Redirect Provider Behavior. Indonesia is unlikely to achieve all \nof the health MDGs by 2015 if the past approaches are not changed. The key challenge is to \nimprove the efficiency of the health system. At this time, the effective use of incentives for both ", "54 Appendix 3\nproviders  and  the  population  is  the  key  to  achieving  the  health-related  MDGs.  Additional \nprovider incentives would probably not be necessary in an effective public health system, but \nIndonesia\u2019s  public  health  system  has  become  essentially  a  \u201cprivatized\u201d  system,  in  which \npersonnel respond mainly to material incentives (including those afforded by their part-time \nprivate practices). In this situation, revised incentives are needed to channel provider behavior \nin directions that contribute to accelerated achievement of the health-related MDGs. \n52. Supporting  Pro-Poor  Health  Programs.  Since  there  are  large  differentials,  both \nregionally and among various socioeconomic groups, in most of the MDG-related impact and \nintermediate outcome indicators, a key part of any strategy to ensure achievement of the health \nMDGs  must  include  finding  ways  to  direct  additional  resources  to  poor,  under-performing \nlocalities, as well as to the poor regardless of where they reside. However, these additional \nresources should not be channeled directly to providers, as has been done in the past. Instead, \nthe additional resources should be channeled to the target population (i.e., to the demand side) \nso that accountability between providers and clients is strengthened. ASKESKIN represents the \nculmination of several years of testing various approaches to providing targeted health financing \nfor the poor. Although the program still has some limitations, ASKESKIN is likely to accelerate \nthe achievement of the health MDGs by improving access by the poor to health services. \n53. Providing Incentives to Redirect Consumer Behavior. Conditional cash transfers \n(CCTs) are needed to compensate poor women for the time they spend obtaining cost-effective \nhealth care for themselves and their children. Time is often a poor person\u2019s only productive \nresource, and women\u2019s time is particularly scarce. CCTs are an effective way to overcome the \nopportunity cost of women\u2019s time as a barrier to health-care utilization. They can also be used to \nprovide additional incentives for particularly critical types of health care (for example, to ensure \nthat all children are fully immunized or to promote birthing in health facilities). Plans are currently \nbeing made to pilot CCTs in Indonesia. Scaling up the pilots will be an important additional \nmeasure to accelerate achievement of the health MDGs.

", "72 Appendix 6 \nMACROECONOMIC ASSESSMENT LETTER FROM  \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: INDONESIA \nAugust 28, 2007 \nStaff Assessment of Developments and Policies \nRecent Developments and Short-Term Prospects \nEconomic growth reached 5\u00bd percent in 2006 as the dip in activity following the late 2005 \nfuel price and interest rate hikes proved shallow. Strong exports compensated for weak \ndomestic demand. Notwithstanding heightened risks to the outlook from a possible slowing of \nU.S. growth, staff still projects GDP growth at around 6 percent in 2007 with some shift from \nexternal to domestic demand. Inflation has fallen in recent months to around 6 percent\u2014the \nmiddle of the 2007 target range of 5\u20137 percent\u2014allowing Bank Indonesia (BI) to lower its policy \nrate further to 8\u00bc percent. The external current account surplus is projected to narrow from 2\u00be \npercent of GDP to around 1\u00be percent in 2007 as lower global growth and commodity prices \nreduce exports. The central government deficit increased modestly to 1.0 percent of GDP in \n2006. For 2007, staff projects a somewhat higher deficit of around 1.6\u20131.8 percent of GDP. \nAlong with other emerging markets, Indonesia\u2019s equity and bond markets were hit by the \nrecent turmoil in global financial markets. The extent of the sell-off was relatively high in a \nregional comparison, but it followed a prolonged period of increases, driven by the abundant \nglobal risk appetite as well as domestic factors such as declining interest rates and perceptions \nof reduced vulnerability and improving economic prospects. Portfolio capital flows mirrored \nthese  developments  as  foreign  investors  increased  their  positions  in  Indonesian  securities \nduring most of 2007, then reduced exposure since mid-July. After appreciating in May vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe U.S. dollar in response to portfolio inflows, the rupiah has subsequently fallen by around 7 \npercent (3\u00bd percent since the Article IV consultation in mid-July), but remains within a range \nconsistent with external competitiveness and macroeconomic stability. \nBanking sector indicators have strengthened, although the impact on balance sheets \nfrom the recent market turmoil has yet to be fully assessed. Over the past year, bank \nprofitability has improved. The banking system is well capitalized and nonperforming loans are \nlow for private banks. State banks\u2019 non-performing loans have fallen significantly but still remain \nhigher. Overall, with the improving indicators, the banking system appears to be in a relatively \ngood  position  to  weather  the  recent  global  financial  market  turmoil.  Direct  exposure  to \ncollateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or other structured credit products appears minimal and \nIndonesian financial markets have so far remained sufficiently liquid during periods of market \npressure.\nSimilarly, external vulnerability indicators have improved over the past year, helping the \neconomy to weather recent volatility. Fiscal deficits are modest and public debt is 2 declining, \nthe external current account is in surplus, and the exchange rate is broadly market determined, \nwith some symmetric market intervention to smooth volatility and automatic purchases of the \ngovernment\u2019s foreign exchange receipts. The ratio of total external debt to GDP is expected to \ndecline to less than 20 percent of GDP by 2012, from 35 percent in 2006, while government \ndebt (including domestic debt) is projected to decline from 39 percent of GDP to 26 percent over \nthe same period. A steady build-up of reserves and lower external borrowing have increased the \nratio of reserves to short term debt to more than 150 percent. ", "Appendix 6  73\nNonetheless, downside risks remain to the positive outlook, in particular related to the \nglobal  financial  market  turmoil  and  its  impact  on  global  growth.  While  reduced \nvulnerabilities have put the Indonesian economy in a good position to weather moderate external \nshocks (see adverse macro scenarios in the 2007 Article IV staff report), a sharper than expected \nslowdown in global economic growth and a sustained reduction in risk appetite could have a \nsignificant negative impact on the Indonesian economy. The main risks arise from potentially \nlower export demand and commodity prices, reduced access to financing and higher financing \ncosts, and possible balance sheet impacts of lower asset prices and a depreciated rupiah. \nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \nThe  government  continues  to  implement  its  comprehensive  reform  agenda  to  boost \ngrowth over the medium term. Key elements of the strategy include policies to strengthen \nfinancial intermediation, improve the business climate, and increase infrastructure investment. \nWhile substantial progress has been achieved, including passing of a new investment law and \nseveral  fiscal  reforms, other  measures,  particularly  with respect  to  the  labor  market,  have \nencountered resistance. \n(cid:120) With  respect  to  monetary  policy,  Bank  Indonesia  (BI)  has  responded \nflexibly to shocks to inflation and output, while building the credibility of its \nnewly established inflation targeting framework. The latest policy meeting \nsaw  a  pause  in the  current  rate-cutting  cycle,  in  response  to  the  recent \nweakening in the rupiah and uncertainty over the fall-out from the global financial \nturmoil. Staff judge that room for further rate cuts will remain limited, particularly \nsince the full effect of recent rate cuts is likely still to be felt and the currency has \nshown some renewed weakness in recent months. \n(cid:120) In  the  staff\u2019s  view,  the  recent  relaxation  of  prudential  regulations  to \nencourage lending is not likely to have much impact on lending growth. At\nthe same time, the steps represent a departure from international standards and \nrisk having an adverse signaling effect on supervisors and banks alike. With bank \nlending  already  increasing,  in  the  staff\u2019s  view  BI  should  reconsider  the \nappropriateness  of  the  measures  as  soon  as  possible.  Moral  suasion  to \nencourage banks to lend to specific 3 sectors could result in credit misallocation \nand should also be avoided. Instead, staff has encouraged the authorities to \nstrengthen  efforts  to  promote  the  development  of  capital  markets  and \ninstruments of longer-term financing and to develop a strategy on the future role \nof state banks. \n(cid:120) The authorities\u2019 projected fiscal stance is appropriate. The modest relaxation \nin  deficit  targets  for  2007  and  2008  provides  some  room  for  additional \ndevelopment  spending  while  ensuring  further  declining  debt  ratios.  Further \nimprovements  in  tax  administration,  some  new  tax  measures,  and  the \nstreamlining of expenditures, including through greater flexibility of energy prices, \ncould create additional space for priority spending, such as infrastructure, health, \nand  education.  Enhancing  the  implementation  capacity  of  local  government \nwould also contribute to this effort. \n(cid:120) The  authorities  have  made  good  progress  in  fiscal  reform.  Recent\nachievements include the restructuring of the tax agency and the adoption of a \nkey tax reform bill. The planned introduction of a fiscal risk statement and the \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework  in  the  2008  budget  should  help  to  further \nstrengthen fiscal management. ", "74 Appendix 6 \n(cid:120) Structural  reforms  have  advanced  with  the  recent  passage  of  the \ninvestment law and the presentation of a new economic policy package. \nWhile publication of the negative list for foreign investors raised some concerns \nin the foreign business community, the law retains a broadly open investment \nregime and clarifies existing ownership limits, which were previously opaque. The \nprivatization process has also been restarted, with the sale of a minority stake in \na major state owned bank in July. However, progress on the difficult issue of \nlabor market reform remains limited. \nStatus of IMF Relations \n(cid:120)  The 2007 Article IV consultation was completed on July 18, 2007. \n(cid:120)  The next Fund mission is scheduled for November/December, 2007.

The  Poverty  Reduction  and  MDG  Acceleration  Program  (PRMAP)  supports  the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the Government) in its commitment towards the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in education (MDG 2) and health (MDGs 4, 5, 6), and \ncontributes to the Government\u2019s poverty reduction agenda (MDG 1), and gender equality (MDG \n3). National level progress in meeting the MDG targets obscures vast differences across regions \nand districts, rural and urban areas, and income groups, and between men and women. The \nPRMAP provides financial resources to support the Government in implementing its MDG-\nrelated public expenditure programs more effectively, through policy, institutional, legal and \nregulatory  reforms  in  the  education  and  health  sectors.  It  builds  on  and  enhances \nimplementation and effectiveness of existing government programs and Asian Development \nBank (ADB)-supported assistance in poverty reduction, gender mainstreaming, and health and \neducation.\n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) complements the PRMAP by directly supporting \nthe achievement of national policy objectives aimed at improving access to and efficiency and \nperformance of government programs. TA is provided to support achievement of key health and \neducation-related actions in subprogram 2 (SP2, April 2007\u2013March 2009). Specific SP2 policy \nactions have been identified for TA support, based on their strategic impact and added value for \nthe Government in accelerating MDG outcomes in health and education. The following criteria \nwere applied in prioritizing TA support for SP2 actions: (i) requests by government agencies to \nimplement PRMAP reforms, (ii) alternative financing sources available to support inputs leading \nto SP2 actions, and (iii) the size of TA budget support for PRMAP. The TA complements \nongoing ADB-supported initiatives that aim to expand access, improve the quality of services, \nand enhance governance and accountability in both health and education.1 Concerted efforts \nhave  been  made  to  synergize  activities  with  other  donor-assisted  programs  to  ensure \ncomplementarity in advancing achievement of the MDGs (see Supplementary Appendix E).  \nB.  The Proposed Technical Assistance  \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n3.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  is  to  strengthen  social  service  delivery  within  a \nframework for accelerated achievement of the MDGs (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) at the national level. \nThe TA supports the decentralization process through national policy reforms in health and \neducation. The TA complements the PRMAP, and supports improvements for more efficient \npublic spending in health and education.  \n                                                \n1  The  TA  complements  ongoing  ADB-supported  initiatives:  ADB.  2001.

", " 78 Appendix 8 \n2.  Components and Outputs \n4.  The TA will support ministries primarily responsible for achieving PRMAP SP2 (April \n2007\u2013March 2009) policy reforms by 2009. The TA includes three sets of outputs at the national \nlevel to support: (i) Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional (BAPPENAS) and the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) in achieving PRMAP SP2 cross-sectoral policy actions; (ii) BAPPENAS, the \nMinistry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  and  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  (MORA)  in \nachieving PRMAP SP2 education-related policy actions; and (iii) BAPPENAS and Ministry of \nHealth (MOH) in achieving PRMAP SP2 health-related policy actions. Additional support might \nbe  provided  to  other  line  ministries,  as  identified  during  implementation.  Figure  1  above \ncaptures suggested activities under each output. \na.  Support  for  Cross-Sectoral  National  Policy  Reforms  for  MDG \nAcceleration\n5.  Component  1  will  support  three  policy  actions  under  SP2:  (i)  recommendations  for \nstrengthening the technical guidelines of the Dana Alokasi Khusus (DAK), (ii) finalization of \nselected sex-disaggregated MDG health and education indicators, and (iii) development of a \nMDG roadmap and preparation of general guidelines on mainstreaming the MDGs into district \nmedium-term development plans and district poverty reduction strategies.  \n6. Improved DAK Technical Guidelines for the Education and Health Sectors. The \nDAK is one of the instruments available to the Government to transfer financial resources to \ndistricts  for  sector-specific  investments.  The  DAK  remained  undeveloped  until  recently; \nhowever, in recent years, the Government has significantly increased the size and the scope of \nthe DAK allocated for the health and education sectors. The TA will support MONE, MOH and \nBAPPENAS in evaluating the current patterns of allocation and utilization of the education and \nhealth DAK by district governments. The TA will also assist in the design and evaluation of \ndifferent options to transform the sectoral DAK into a more relevant instrument for (i) targeting \nfunds to specific districts with insufficient resources for health and/or education, (ii) improving \ndistrict  performance  in  those  sectors  at  the  district  level,  and  (iii)  encouraging  districts  to \nincrease the quantity and efficiency of their own resource investment in MDG-related areas. The \nvarious dimensions of the education and health DAK (i.e., allocation levels to each district, \nconditionalities and monitoring systems) will be further developed in order to transform the \nprogram, and to ensure that funding for MDG-related education and health expenditures is \nprovided in an efficient, equitable, transparent and stable manner. \n7. Sex-Disaggregated MDG Indicators. Achieving gender equity in accessing health and \neducation services is an important aspect of accelerating achievement of the MDGs. Two MDGs \nfocus directly on women\u2014MDG 3 (promoting gender equality and empowerment of women) and \nMDG 5 (improving maternal mortality). Indicators selected to measure progress in achieving \nMDG 3 and 5 do not require data to be disaggregated by sex, but achievement needs to be \nplaced within a wider gender context. The TA will support BAPPENAS in coordinating the \nfinalization  of  key  indicators  among  MONE,  MORA,  MOH,  and  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment (MOWE) for selected MDGs in health and education. These selected indicators \ncould be used to monitor MDG-related progress within their respective sectors, and help target \nresources more efficiently for accelerating MDG achievement. Support for this policy action will \nneed to be coordinated closely with support provided by the TA for other policy actions.\n8. Establish a Planning Framework for MDG Acceleration. In coordination with the MDG \nTARGET program supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and ADB\u2019s \nTA  6762-INO:  Pro-poor  Planning  and  Budgeting,  the  TA  will  assist  BAPPENAS  prepare \nguidelines  to  (i)  encourage  and  assist  local  governments  to  mainstream  the  MDGs  in  their ", "Appendix 8  79 \nmedium-term and annual development plans, budgets and poverty reduction strategies; and (ii) \nencourage MONE, MOHA, MORA and MOWE to include MDG and targets in their medium term \nand annual plans. The TA will also support BAPPENAS and Menko Kesra (the Coordinating \nMinistry  of  Social Welfare) in the  preparation  of a comprehensive roadmap for  accelerating \nattainment of MDGs. The roadmap could include strategies for: (i) development of an institutional \nframework for acceleration of the MDGs, involving key central government ministries and local \ngovernments; (ii) increasing public awareness about the MDGs; (iii) approaches to increase the \ninvolvement of civil society, the private sector and research institutions in efforts to attain the \nMDGs; (iv) improving data collection, processing and monitoring mechanisms, and reporting of \nMDG-related indicators; (v) assessing cost and budget implications for achievement of the MDGs; \nand (vi) developing sectoral policies for consideration by Government ministries in their medium-\nterm development plans. \nb.  Support  for  National  Policy  Reforms  in  Education  for  MDG \nAcceleration\n9.  Component 2 will support MONE and MORA in reaching two policy actions under SP2: \n(i) assessment of the effectiveness of different strategies and programs in meeting the basic \neducation objectives in the Grand Design for Nine Year Basic Education 2005-2009, and (ii) \ndemonstration of use of the \u201cCitizens Report Card (CRC) for Education\u201d for surveying mothers \nand fathers (or guardians) on their satisfaction with the service delivery of local school systems.  \n10. Education  Sector  Performance  Assessment  and  Monitoring.  MONE  and  MORA \ncompleted a joint-plan (the \u201cGrand Design\u201d) in 2007 for the completion of 9-year basic education \nthat presents a combined vision from both ministries aimed at achieving national education \nobjectives, including basic education. The TA will support activities to assess education sector \nperformance prior to development of the new medium-term plan for national education in 2009, \nand related investment plans of MONE, MORA and district governments. \n11. Piloting the Citizens Report Card for Education. The CRC approach and survey \nmethodology  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance,  on  the  premise  that  feedback  from \ncommunities  that  use  public  services  provides  reliable  and  relevant  information,  which  is \nneeded to improve governance and delivery of public services. Based on CRC survey results, \nrecommendations for improvement may not necessarily entail additional financial costs. The TA \nwill support efforts to enhance local accountability in the delivery of basic education services by \nadapting the CRC approach to the Indonesian context. A research institute will be recruited to \nundertake the planning, administration, and analysis of the survey. The institute will be required \nto submit time-bound reports on findings at different stages. \nc.  Support for National Policy Reforms in Health for MDG Acceleration \n12.  Component 3 will support MOH in strengthening policy, strategies and financing aimed to \nimprove access to and efficiency and quality of health-related MDG services (e.g., maternal and \nchild health, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS). The TA will support MOH in undertaking five policy \nactions under SP2, and initiate background assessments to implement SP3 including: (i) review and \nimprove the criteria used for centrally provided budget allocations for maternal neonatal and child \nhealth (MNCH) and communicable disease control (CDC) activities; (ii) support an analysis leading \nto a set of recommendations for the revision of the ASKESKIN program design and implementation \nmodalities; (iii) support an evaluation of contract provider payment-schemes, especially (a) the \nimpact of such schemes on the distribution of providers in poor/remote areas; and (b) utilization of \nhealth-related MDG services (i.e. MNCH and CDC), especially by women; (iv) assist in finalizing the \nrevision of a ministerial regulation regarding health-related minimum service standards (MSSs); and \n(v) assist  in the development of a national health accounts (NHAs) program.  ", " 80 Appendix 8 \n13. Improved Budget Allocation for MNCH/CDC Programs. The Government needs to \nincrease future health funding, and MOH will need to improve targeting of budget allocations so \nas to benefit (i) MDG-related health programs and (ii) areas with poorer health outcomes. The \nTA  will  assist  MOH  in  reviewing  the  current  criteria  used  for  centrally  provided  budget \nallocations for MNCH/CDC, and will help formulate possible mechanism(s) whereby a portion of \nthe  central  MOH  budget  may  be  used  to  improve  the  level  and  allocation  of  direct  and \noperational budgets for health programs and activities at local government levels. Further, the \nTA will assist in analyzing MOH budget and expenditures allocations for MDG-related health \nprograms to better estimate central budget resources required to meet MDG-related health \noutcomes. In addition, the TA will assist in analyzing options for improving the efficiency and \nequity of MDG-related health services delivery through development of: (a) formulae to allocate \ncentral government budget for each MDG program among provinces and from the provinces to \nthe districts; (b) mechanisms to utilize central government budget to leverage additional local \ngovernment allocations; and (c) mechanisms to link central government budget allocations to \nimproved local government reporting on utilization of supported services. The criteria that MOH \ndevelops would be coordinated with the cross-sectoral efforts under the PRMAP TA to develop \nallocation formula options for the health DAK based on the identification of MDG-deficit districts \n(i.e., those which lag behind in achievement of the selected MDG-related indicators). \n14. Recommendations for ASKESKIN Program Improvements. The ASKESKIN program \nwas introduced by MOH in 2005 to (i) improve targeting of government budget resources to \nfinance  health  services  utilized  by  the  poor,  (ii)  increase  financing  for  operational  and \nmaintenance expenses of public sector health facilities, and (iii) increase the efficiency of funds \nmanagement  by  contracting  a  third-party  agency  to  independently  manage  the  funds  and \nprovider contracts. Since 2005, the program has evolved by allowing fee-for-service payment \nwith  both  public  and  eligible  nongovernment  providers  (i.e.  midwives  and  select  private \nhospitals). The TA will support MOH in developing a set of recommendations for the revision of \nthe ASKESKIN program design and implementation modalities, including appropriate provider \npayment mechanisms, reimbursement levels for specific services that directly impact on MDG \noutcomes. This analysis will take into account evaluations of ASKESKIN and other appropriate \nhealth-related MDG efforts, feedback related to recent program adjustments, and the longer-\nterm development of Indonesia\u2019s national health insurance policy and design. \n15. Increasing Health Providers in Remote Areas. The ratios of physicians, midwives, \nand nurses to the population are below the \u201c2010 Healthy Indonesia\u201d targets, and there are \nsignificant variations in the distribution of health personnel per capita between provinces and \namong districts.2 MOH uses a number of means to attract primary healthcare providers (e.g., \nphysicians and midwives) to remote and underserved areas. For instance, MOH has adopted \nmixed provider payment mechanisms through ASKEKSIN that influence financial incentives \naffecting provider location choices and service provision behavior. The TA will support MOH in \nconducting an evaluation of the contract provider payment-schemes on: (i) their effectiveness in \nreaching women and those in poor and/or remote areas, (ii) the impact of the scheme on \nutilization of MNCH/CDC services, and (iii) the impact of the scheme on the distribution of \nprimary  healthcare  providers  across  provinces  and  districts.  This  TA  will  also  review \ninternational experience regarding alternative options used to reduce inequities in provider \ndistribution,  and  the  impact  on  service  use  and  MDG  reduction  targets.  This  will  require \ndocumentation of the different modalities currently used to attract and retain health personnel in \nremote and underserved areas, with particular attention to increasing the provision of integrated \nprimary health services for women and children in the community. TA input will complement \nrather than duplicate studies under development by World Bank involving health-related human \nresource issues in Indonesia. \n                                                \n2  Ministry of Health. 2006. Subnational Health System Performance Assessment. Jakarta. ", "Appendix 8  81 \n16. Meeting National Standards in MNCH/CDC. GOI has advised all ministries to define a \nstandard  set  of  indicators  estimating  the  minimum  services  standards  (MSS)  to  be  met \ncountrywide. The establishment of MSS for the health sector is expected to help meet national \npriorities, including attainment of the MDGs. The MOH ministerial decree of 2003 related to \nMSSs is currently being revised. The updated MSSs decree is expected to identify intermediate \nindicators, for child nutrition, MNCH, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The fundamental \nprinciples  and  objectives  of  MSS  need  to  be  clarified  and  a  methodology  developed  in \nformulating its implementation and monitoring. The TA will work closely with MOH and MOHA to \nclarify objectives and to improve health-related MSS to ensure that health-related MDG services \nare included. The TA will assist MOH to formulate criteria for inclusion of relevant programs and \nindicators for the health-related MSS. It will also assist MOH to ensure that central and local \ngovernment obligations are clearly identified in the MSS, including financial obligations. The TA \nwill  support  the  finalization  of  the  ministerial  decree  and  complement  ongoing  efforts  by \nDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Technishe Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) related to the MSS. \n17. Institutionalizing  a  National  Health  Accounts  Program.  NHAs  provide  data  and \nanalysis of total public and private expenditure for health by payer, financing intermediary, and \nprovider.  NHAs  may  also  provide  analysis  of  expenditure  by  program,  type  of  input,  and \ngeographic area. Institutionalization of NHAs in Indonesia may be used to improve targeting of \npublic  expenditures  on  health-related  MDG  programs  and  on  those  districts  with  poor \nachievement related to MDG indicators. NHAs data collection and analyses will help improve \nmonitoring of health public expenditure against specific outcomes (e.g., access and equity of \nallocation, and allocation and technical efficiency). To improve the quality of information and \nanalysis of total and public expenditures for health, BAPPENAS plans to institutionalize a NHAs \nprogram in Indonesia. The TA will support BAPPENAS, MOH and other stakeholders in the \ndevelopment of a roadmap for a NHAs program for Indonesia. The roadmap will consider the \ndevolution to the district level of decision-making authority over public health spending and \nindependent  implementation  of  district  health  accounts  analyses,  so  as  to  improve  the \nevaluation by districts of allocation and the technical efficiency of resource use. The roadmap \nwill explore ways in which district-level health accounts can be undertaken and institutionalized \nto  facilitate  an  ongoing  program.  Pilot  district  health  accounts  analysis  will  be  supported \nnationwide to ensure that common methodological approaches are used. \n  3.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented in parallel with the PRMAP and will cover a period of 20 \nmonths, from 1 January 2008 to 31 August 2009. Implementation arrangements for both the \nproposed TA and the PRMAP will be the same, so as to ensure synergy between the program \nloan  cluster  and  the  TA.  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  line  ministries \nresponsible for the various sectors will act as the implementing agencies. The steering committee \nestablished for PRMAP will be the same for the TA. It will be chaired by BAPPENAS and include \nrepresentatives  of  MOF,  MOWE,  MOH,  MONE,  MORA,  and  MOHA.  The  proposed  TA  is \nestimated at $2.7 million, of which ADB will finance $1.5 million as a grant, with the Government\nproviding  counterpart  support  equal  to  $200,000  equivalent.  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) will provide $1 million in parallel co-financing. Table A8.1 \ncontains the cost estimates and financing plan. \n19.  A team of international specialists (total 46 person-months) and national experts (31 \nperson-months), supported by ADB, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) following the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and using a full technical proposal. A team of international specialists \n(total 30 person-months) and national experts (40 person-months), supported by AusAID on a \nparallel basis, will be recruited individually. A research institute with significant experience \nworking with governments on governance and public service delivery issues will be recruited ", " 82 Appendix 8 \nthrough direct selection to undertake the Citizen Report Card satisfaction survey for basic \neducation. The outlined terms of reference (TOR) and person-months for each specialist are \nfound in Supplementary Appendix E.\n20.  BAPPENAS will be supported by an international MDG advisor in the development of a \ngeneral framework for MDG acceleration. This advisor will also act as the team leader for the \nTA. BAPPENAS, MONE, MORA and MOH will also be supported by specialists and experts \nwith expertise in gender, data management, financial management, education performance \nmonitoring and assessment, learning assessments, health financing and insurance, and health \nsystems support. They will be responsible for submitting reports to ADB, the Government, and \nAusAID. Emphasis will be on technical content rather than administrative aspects, describing \nthe advice provided to the Government in simple terms. Technical briefs will be prepared by \nconsultants on a needs-basis. Individual output reports from each sector will be submitted to \nBAPPENAS and other relevant ministries, ADB, and AusAID for review and comments prior to \nfinalization.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?       No  in country poverty partnership agreement?     No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nThe Government of Indonesia (the Government) aims to (i) enhance the quantity as well as quality of public \nexpenditures; (ii) improve local government accountability, while maintaining the basic principles of regional autonomy; \nand (iii) adopt sound and sustainable resource allocation mechanisms to target poverty reduction and accelerated \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (\u201cMDG acceleration\u201d) in areas that lag behind. In recent \nyears, fiscal consolidation has been at the center of the Government\u2019s macroeconomic management. Since the Asian \nfinancial crisis of 1997, the Government has instituted a number of structural reforms across different sectors to \nremove the distortions that led up to the crisis in 1997. However, in the past the Government has been unable to \nmaintain its development expenditures, especially on education and health.  \nThe Government\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK) has identified a lack of access to key basic services \n(e.g., health and education) and to economic opportunities as factors contributing to poverty. The SNPK aims to: (i) \nestablish Indonesia\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction, (ii) build consensus on poverty eradication, (iii) underline the \ncommitment to achieving the MDGs, and (iv) synchronize poverty reduction activities. It is incorporated into the \nGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan (RJPM) 2004\u20132009. To implement the SNPK, the Government is \npreparing a national poverty reduction action plan in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The current draft is in-line \nwith the priority areas of the 2007 budget. \nThe proposed impact of the Poverty Reduction and MDGs Acceleration Program (PRMAP) is to accelerate progress \ntowards achieving the MDGs in education (MDG 2), health (MDGs 4, 5, 6) and contribute to the Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction agenda (MDG 1), and gender equality (MDG 3). The program will be implemented in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s national priorities as reflected in the existing RPJM. The PRMAP is aligned with the Government\u2019s systems \nand assistance, and supports the Government\u2019s efforts to increase spending directed to attainment of the MDGs. The \nproposed TA for strengthening social sector services delivery supports these actions and reforms in the health and \neducation sectors.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (non-income MDGs)\nIndonesia spans an archipelago of over 17,000 islands, of which about 7,000 are inhabited by approximately 235 \nmillion people, living in about 440 districts in 33 provinces. An estimated 742 ethnic groups and languages are found \nin Indonesia, and many Indonesians identify themselves with a specific language and/or island. Based on household \nsurvey data, poverty incidence has fallen from 23% in 1999 to 16% in 2005. According to the international poverty line \n($1/day), poverty incidence is estimated at 7% based on purchasing power parity. About 49% of the population lives \non $2 per day (2005). By 2009, the target is to reduce poverty (with respect to the national poverty line) to about 8.2%. \nHowever, in March 2006, poverty incidence increased to 17.7%, following the fuel subsidy reductions and an increase \nin the price of rice in 2005. \nLack of access to key social sector services such as health and education is one of the main causes of poverty in \nIndonesia. Lack of access to basic education significantly decreases productivity and personal income. Lack of access \nto affordable health services affects the health status of individuals and poor health decreases productivity and \npersonal income. The poor are more vulnerable to health shocks due to high medical expenses for treating diseases, \nlost school and work days for recovery, high transportation costs, and other access barriers. The opportunity cost of \ncompleting basic education is also greater for children, especially girls, from poor households.\nNational-level progress in achieving the MDGs obscures vast differences across regions and districts, rural and urban \nareas, income groups and genders. The Human Development Report (2006)1 ranked Indonesia 108th (HDI value of \n0.71) among 177 nations in terms of the human development index (HDI). In 2002, the HDI value for Indonesia was \n0.66, but across regions, the HDI ranged from 0.76 in Jakarta to 0.47 in the Jayawijaya district in Papua. Indonesia\u2019s \nnational gender-related development index (GDI) for 2002 shows the male adult literacy rate to be 93.5%, while the \nfemale rate was 85.7%. Variations among provincial and district GDIs are also evident. In 2002, the GDI in DKI \nJakarta was 66.7, in Bangka Belitung 47.7, in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam 55.5, and in North Maluku 31.2. \nDuring program preparation, the Policy Matrix for PRMAP was reviewed from the perspective of assessing (i) the \npotential for adverse poverty and social impacts, if any, of the policy actions and/or reforms; (ii) areas for gender \nmainstreaming and/or enhancement through (a) additional actions, if any, or (b) rephrasing of actions that are more \nconducive to mainstreaming efforts; and (iii) areas for enhancing collection of regional and district-level information to \ninform future policy actions. The policy actions in the Policy Matrix were also assessed to determine potential adverse \nimpacts on deepening social and regional disparities. As a result of the assessment, some policy actions were refined \nand/or better explained in the accompanying sector write-up.  \nC.  Participation Process\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes     No \nThe program and the TA have been prepared based on extensive consultations with a wide range of government \nofficials, development partners and other concerned stakeholders. Sector specialists have shared the policy matrix \nwith respective development partners in health and education sector forums. BAPPENAS and other concerned line \nministries have provided direction and suggestions, which have fed into the design of the PRMAP and TA.

", "84 Appendix 9 \npolicy dialogue with the Government, development partners, and other concerned agencies is required to achieve the \nsubprogram 2 and 3 actions and overall program outputs.  \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes                   No \nA participation strategy has been integrated into the policy actions framework. It identifies the lead line ministries \nresponsible for achieving each policy action. The policy measures aimed at improving governance and monitoring \nsystems  focus  on  enhancing  the  potential  benefits  of  decentralization  by  making  social  sector  services  more \nresponsive to local preferences and making service providers more accountable to their clients. Civil society, private \nsector and research institutions will participate in the preparation of the roadmap for MDG acceleration under SP2. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe joint-donor Country Gender Assessment for Indonesia (2006)2 and meetings with key informants in the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s Empowerment, National Development Planning Agency, Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Religious \nAffairs, and Ministry of Health, and partner agencies, provided the context for assessing the affects of the policy matrix \non gender issues within the health and education sectors. Policy actions in the matrix were refined according to the \nmethodology described in section B. The disaggregation of information by sex, and consideration of specific gender \nchallenges in health and education are basic requirements for effective monitoring of policy conditions, achievement of \nSP2 policy actions, and more equitable allocation of budgetary resources. \nHas an output been prepared?  Yes No\nA policy output for gender mainstreaming has been included under the cross-sectoral section of the policy action \nmatrix  (PO.4).
