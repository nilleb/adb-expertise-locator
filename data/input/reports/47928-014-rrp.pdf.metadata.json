Developing  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG) \ninfrastructure  is  therefore  critical  for  India's  energy  security  and  for  the  power  industry.  This \nsecond expansion of the Dahej LNG Terminal capitalizes on the success of Dahej\u2019s successful \nfirst- and second-phase terminals financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and aims to \nhelp  address  energy  shortage  in  India.  ADB  has  assisted  Petronet  LNG\u2019s  growth  in  a  phased \nmanner. In January 2004, ADB helped finance Petronet LNG\u2019s first terminal through an equity \ninvestment  [Confidential  information  has  been  deleted].  The  first  terminal  began  commercial \noperations  in  April  2004  with  a  capacity  of  5  million  metric  tons  per  annum  (mmtpa). \n[Confidential information has been deleted]. To meet the still growing unmet demand for natural \ngas  in  India,  ADB  financed  the  first  expansion  of  Petronet  LNG  [Confidential  information  has \nbeen  deleted].  The  first  terminal  expansion  project  commenced  operations  in  July 2009  within \nthe  original  cost  and  time  estimates.  [Confidential  information  has  been  deleted],  as  per  the \nextended  annual  review  report,  the  project  was  rated  highly  successful.  In  particular,  the \ndevelopment  impact  of  the  project  and  business  success  was  rated  excellent,  and  Petronet \nLNG\u2019s environmental, social, health, and safety performance as well as its investment outcomes \nwere rated satisfactory.  \n \n3. \nNatural  gas  is  increasingly  a  choice  for  cleaner  fuel  in  India  but  domestic  production \nremains  insufficient  to  meet  growing  demand.  This  unmet  demand  is  being  filled  by  imported \nLNG.  As  the  market  leader,  Petronet  LNG  is  ideally  placed  to  lead  this  much-needed  LNG \nexpansion  in  India.  In  preparation  for  the  second  Dahej  expansion,  the  borrower  approached \nADB  for  financing  based  on  the  strong  relationship  ADB  has  established,  ADB\u2019s  profile  in  the \nmarket,  and  its  ability  to  provide  long-term  financing  and  help  catalyze  other  financing  for  the \nproject,  particularly  given  the  somewhat  unsettled  financial  market  conditions  in  India.  From \ninitial  discussions  with  Petronet  LNG,  the  project  team  believed  that  the  project  possesses \nsound  business  fundamentals  and ADB\u2019s  participation  will  provide  long-term  financing  needed \nfor  the  project.  It  will  also  confirm  ADB\u2019s  confidence  in  the  sector  and  support  for  the  Dahej \nexpansion [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n4. \nThe project will involve the expansion to 15 mmtpa of the existing Dahej LNG terminal, \nwhich has a current capacity of 10 mmtpa. The project will, to a large extent, use the existing \nfacilities.  Additional  facilities  will  include  two  storage  tanks  and  regasification  facilities,  and \ninstallation of associated utilities and facilities. The project site is located at Dahej in the Gulf of \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n\f2      \n\nKhambhat  in  Gujarat.  The  project  design  is  based  on  a  take-or-pay  toll,  with  Petronet  LNG \nacting as a tolling agent [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \n5. \n \n\n [Confidential information has been deleted]. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n \n\n6. \nThe  borrower,  Petronet  LNG,  was  incorporated  in  April  1998  and  is  a  public  limited \ncompany established under the Companies Act, 1956. Given that the total equity participation of \npublic  sector  utilities  and/or  entities  is  50%,  Petronet  LNG  is  considered  a  nongovernment \ncompany,  enjoys  the  autonomy  available  to  companies  in  the  private  sector,  and is  subject  to \nthe  same  regulations  and  competition  that  any  other  private  sector  company  faces.  Petronet \nLNG is promoted by a strong shareholder group composed of India\u2019s leading oil and natural gas \ncompanies: BPCL, rated Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; GAIL, rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s; IOCL, rated AAA by \nCrisil    ;  and  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  Limited,  rated  Baa1  by  Moody\u2019s.  Each  promoter \nholds a 12.5% stake. In addition, GDF Suez is the strategic partner of Petronet LNG with 10% \nequity, and ADB and public shareholders are the other shareholders. \n \n7. \nPetronet LNG currently owns and operates two LNG import and regasification terminals, \none with a capacity of 10 mmtpa at Dahej in Gujarat and the other with a capacity of 5 mmtpa at \nKochi in Kerala. In addition, the borrower is in the process of constructing a second LNG jetty at \nDahej  to  provide  increased  flexibility  in  port  operations.  Petronet  LNG  is  locally  rated  AA+  by \nICRA  Limited  and  India  Ratings  and  Research,  reflecting  its  strong  business  fundamentals. \n[Confidential information has been deleted]. \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n8. \nThe  second  expansion  of  the  Dahej  LNG  terminal  is  intended  to  strengthen  the \ndevelopment impact of the first two phases by helping India to move toward its target of greater \nnatural gas use and by enhancing its energy security. The project development impact includes \nthe diversification of the energy base in an environmentally sustainable manner. The project will \nhelp  reduce  the  unmet  energy  demand  in  India,  which  has  been  one  of  the  major  constraints \nand bottlenecks for efficient economic growth. As of August 2013, the power sector in India had \na cumulative generation installed capacity of approximately 227 gigawatts (GW) and the energy \ndeficit was approximately 20.43 GW.2 \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  supply  of  natural  gas  to  power  plants, \n9. \nfertilizers plants, transporters and domestic consumers The majority of the LNG is destined for \nnorth  and  west  India  where  the  gas  will  be  fed  into  the  national  grid  as  a  cleaner  fuel  for \nelectricity  generation.  It  will  also  help  meet  the  enormous  demand  for  natural  gas  for  fertilizer \nproduction.  The  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  introduction  of  city  gas  distribution  in \nseveral  cities  where  residential  and  commercial  consumers  will  benefit  from  increased \navailability  of  piped  gas.  The  additional  supply  of  5  mmtpa  will  translate  to  greenhouse  gas \nemission reductions of approximately 3.15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum. \n\n                                                 \n2 Government  of  India,  Central  Electricity  Authority.  2013.

Strategy  2020  emphasizes \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  and  promoting  private  sector  participation.  In  addition,  Strategy \n2020 highlights ADB's operational emphasis on expanding the use of clean energy sources.4 \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  India\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  specifically \nwith  regard  to  emphasis  on  environmental  sustainability  and  infrastructure  development, \nincluding expansion of energy access and catalyzing private sector investment.5 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  stresses  the  importance  of \n13. \nenergy  security  and  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  and  reduction  of  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gases.6 \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n \n14. \nThe previous project experience demonstrated that two main factors to be considered in \ndesigning new project: (i) long-term, fixed-cost financing is crucial for infrastructure development \nin  India  because  of  the  limited  capacity  of  Indian  financial  institutions  to  provide  this  type  of \nfinancing; and (ii) ADB\u2019s participation in Petronet helped strengthen its operations as a private \nsector entity and ADB\u2019s presence was catalytic in helping Petronet raise additional financing.  \n \nD. \n\n[Confidential information has been deleted] \n\n \nE. \n\n \nF. \n\n[Confidential information has been deleted] \n\n \n\n[Confidential information has been deleted] \n\n \n \n                                                 \n3 City gas distribution network is used for transportation, as well as for domestic and commercial gas supply. \n4   ADB.  2008.

[Confidential information has been deleted] \n   \nB. \n \n16. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB's assistance for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB's participation will provide long-term, fixed-cost funding which is required for \nsuccessful implementation of the project and is not easily available in the market, \nparticularly  with  current  financial  market  uncertainty  in  India.  The  majority  of \nPetronet LNG revenues are fixed through its tolling contract and it would like its \nfinancing  costs  to  be  also  fixed  over  the  tenor  of  the  financing,  which  is  not \npossible with Indian banks. Through long-tenor, fixed-cost loan pricing, ADB will \nassist Petronet LNG in providing better financial management and help amortize \nthe  high  up-front  capital  costs  over  the  long  life  of  the  asset  to  ensure  project \nviability.  \nADB\u2019s  participation  can  potentially  catalyze  participation  by  commercial \ncofinanciers  that  would  otherwise  not  have  considered  supporting  the  project. \nSuch participation will assist the borrower in diversifying its funding sources from \ndomestic banks for future projects.  \nThe  loan  will  also  confirm  ADB\u2019s  confidence  in  the  sector  and  support  for  its \nmuch-needed expansion. \nADB\u2019s continued support to Petronet LNG\u2019s growth and participation in the third \nround of financing will add assurance for local and foreign financial institutions to \nco-lend  because  the  project  will  be  structured  with  best  local  and  international \npractices and will adhere to high environmental and social standards. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nC. \n\n[Confidential information has been deleted] \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Safeguards  \n\n \nA. \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n17. \ncategory A for impacts on the environment and category C for both involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous  peoples.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  report  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite  on  2  August  2013  in  accordance  with  the  disclosure  requirement  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  existing  terminal  and  proposed  expansion  site  are  part  of  an  existing \nindustrial  region  and  no  environmentally  sensitive  areas  or  endangered  terrestrial  or  marine \nflora or fauna exist. The plant generates limited air emissions, domestic waste water, solid and \nhazardous waste, and noise pollution. The 38.62 hectare site for expansion is government land \nallotted  on  a  long-term  lease  to  Petronet  LNG  by  the  Gujarat  Industrial  Development \nCorporation.  The  site  is  not  inhabited  and  is  not  occupied  or  used  for  productive  purposes, \neither by individuals or the community. As a result, there will be no resettlement impacts and no \npersons will be either physically or economically displaced by the proposed expansion. Impacts \non  indigenous  peoples  are  unlikely  as  there  is  no  habitation  or  village  with  concentrations  of \nscheduled tribes in the vicinity of the site. Since the commencement of its operations in Dahej in \n2004, Petronet LNG has had a strong involvement with the communities through its corporate \n\n \n\n\fsocial responsibility initiatives in infrastructure, health, education, and community development. \nA public consultation was conducted and a grievance redress mechanism is in place to address \nconcerns and suggestions from the communities. The facility has an established environmental, \nhealth,  and  safety  cell  with  documented  procedures  on  training,  permitting,  and  incident \nrecording. It is also certified to ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OSHAS 18001 standards. The facility \nprovides  for  safe  and  healthy  working  conditions  for  its  staff  as  well  as  its  contractors.  Likely \noperational risks are identified and appropriate measures are in place, including an emergency \nresponse and disaster management plan. The potential environmental and social impacts of the \nproject have been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate \nfor  the  adverse  impacts  have  been  incorporated  in  the  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment document.7  \n \nA  corporate  audit  was  conducted  on  Petronet  LNG\u2019s  quality,  health,  safety,  and \n18. \nenvironment  systems  and  procedures  and  its  past  and  current  performance  against  the \nobjectives, principles, and requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. The audit confirms \nthat  the  existing  LNG  terminal  operations  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nsafeguard requirements. Since lands for the Petronet LNG terminals and facilities are allotted by \nthe government, Petronet LNG\u2019s quality, health, safety, and environment systems currently do \nnot  formally  incorporate  procedures  to  screen,  assess,  and  address  impacts  pertaining  to \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Petronet LNG is committed to (i) enhance the \nquality,  health,  safety,  and  environment  manual  to  include  the  social  safeguard  and  social \nprotection  requirements  of  ADB;  and  (ii)  adopt  a  corporate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  to  comply  with  ADB  requirements  and  adequately  manage  the  project\u2019s \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts  before  the  first  disbursement.  In  addition,  Petronet  LNG  will \nprepare  and  submit  monitoring  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system and the subproject. The institutional capacity and commitment of Petronet \nLNG to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts and risks are deemed adequate. \nInformation  disclosure  and  stakeholder  consultations  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \n19. \nBased  on  the  review  and  assessment  of  the  existing  terminal\u2019s  operations  and  the \ncurrent procedures for procurement, the audit confirmed that national labor laws and regulations \n[confidential information has been deleted] are followed, monitored, and reported. The audit also \nconfirmed  Petronet  LNG\u2019s  commitment  to  provide  work  opportunities  to  the  local  community \nduring  construction.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements.  ADB  will  ensure \nthat  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  requiring  Petronet  LNG  to \ncomply with national labor laws [confidential information has been deleted] for the ADB-financed \nportion of the project, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.8  \n \nB. \n \n20. \nPetronet  LNG  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require Petronet \nLNG  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n                                                 \n7 This consists of 16.00 hectares of land already available to Petronet LNG and 22.62 hectares of land transferred to \nthe  Gujarat  Industrial  Development  Corporation  from  the  Gujarat  state  Forest  Department.
