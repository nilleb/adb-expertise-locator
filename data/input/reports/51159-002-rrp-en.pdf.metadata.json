The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)1 for the Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  assist  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to  (i)  modernize  and  improve  the \nclimate and disaster resilience of four irrigation systems\u2014Kamping Pouy in Battambang province, \nPrek Po in Kampong Cham province, Stung Chinit South in Kampong Thom province, and Canal \n15 in Takeo province\u2014to supply water to 43,500 hectares (ha) for more than 290,000 people, of \nwhom  more  than  half  are  women;  (ii)  ensure  sustainability  of  these  irrigation  schemes  by \nstrengthening  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of  the  government  staff  and  farmer  water \nuser communities (FWUCs) in operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) improve farming practices \nfor increased agricultural productivity and crop diversification; and (iv) establish a national water \nresources data management center (NWRDMC), a water resources information system (WRIS), \nand an irrigation asset management system for better water resources management, planning, \noperations, and investment.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n \n3. \nAgriculture  sector  performance.  Agriculture  is  a  crucial  sector  in  the  Cambodian \neconomy,  contributing  to  24.9%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2018.2  While  the \nagriculture  sector  growth  slowed  down  from  4.7%  per  annum  during  2006\u20132012  to  1.1%  per \nannum  during  2014\u20132017,  it  remains  the  backbone  of  rural  livelihoods  and  has  played  a \nsignificant  role  in  poverty  reduction  (footnote  2).  The  average  poverty  rate  for  rural  areas  in \nCambodia has been reduced from 53% in 2007 to 20% in 2012 largely thanks to the development \nof the agriculture sector.3 However, the number of vulnerable people remains high; the loss of \nonly $0.30 per day in income would bring Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate back up to 40%.4  \n \n4. \nInadequate irrigation  infrastructure. One  of  the  main reasons for  the  sector\u2019s  under-\nperformance is poor agricultural production infrastructure, which severely limits cropping intensity \nand crop diversification. Of the 3.98 million ha of agriculture land, only about 1.30 million ha are \nlocated  within  the  command  area  of  2,480  irrigation  systems.5  90%  of  the  systems  are \nunderperforming or dysfunctional, mainly because of the lack of (i) proper design; (ii) a farm-level \ndistribution  system;  and  (iii)  consideration  for  crop  water  requirements,  water  availability,  and \nhydraulic conditions. As a result, dry season rice crop only accounted for about 18% of total rice \nproduction in Cambodia as farmers only have water for wet season rice, and are not willing to \n\n \n\n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2   ADB. 2019.

Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ninvest in higher-value crops due to unreliable water supply.6 \n\nNatural hazards such as floods and droughts occur annually. There are annual water \n5. \nshortages because of the climate, topography, limited water storage, and accessibility, especially \nin the Tonle Sap river basin. During the wet season, extensive flooding and flash floods cause \ninfrastructure damage and waterborne diseases. Climate change is likely to intensify storms and \nextend the number of consecutive dry days during the wet season, and cause hotter days during \nthe  dry  season.  Annual  rainfall  is  projected  to  increase  by  3.6%\u20134.8%  by  2050,  whereas  the \nnumber of wet days is projected to decrease by 3.7%\u20137.4%.7 This will likely lead to even greater \npressure on water supplies during the dry season and flood management during the wet season. \n \n6. \nInadequate  operation  and  maintenance.  As  agriculture  is  the  biggest  water  user  in \nCambodia, the efficient, effective, and sustainable management of the country\u2019s water resources \ndepends largely on irrigation systems\u2019 performance.8 Thus, it is important to improve O&M cost \nrecovery  using  the  user  pays  principle,  and  sustain  the  increases  in  agricultural  productivity \nthrough  strengthening  capacity  of  government  agencies,  as  well  as  establishing  and  closely \ninvolving the FWUCs in the design, implementation, and O&M of irrigation systems to decrease \ndependence on the state budget for O&M. \n \n7. \nPoor  water  data,  low  capacity,  and  limited  institutional  coordination.  Cambodia\u2019s \nhydrometeorological monitoring network is limited with poor and incomplete water data records. \nInitial water accounting work using remote sensing data was supported by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  but  more  detailed  basin  water  resource  assessments  are  essential  to  inform \ninvestment  decisions.9  The  Ministry  of Water  Resources and Meteorology  (MOWRAM)  and  its \nprovincial  departments  lack  resources  to  sustainably  manage  water  resources  and  effectively \ndevelop  irrigation.  The  lack  of  data  on  water  resources  and  irrigation  and  weak  institutional \ncoordination also pose challenges for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) \nin promoting crop diversification and the shift to higher-value crops. \n \n8. \nThe project will address the agricultural production constraints and reduce disaster risk by \n(i)  modernizing  irrigation  systems  to  improve  water  storage  during  drought  and  manage  water \nduring  flood  events,  (ii)  upgrading  agricultural  support  services  in  crop  diversification,  (iii) \nestablishing a financial and organizational system for FWUCs to increase their role in O&M, and \n(iv) establishing the NWRDMC and WRIS and supporting their operations. \n \n9. \nStrategic fit. The project will contribute to achieving targets defined in the government\u2019s \nRectangular Strategy IV, which aims to develop the country\u2019s irrigated land and manage its water \nresources  more  effectively,  and  reduce  Cambodia\u2019s  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards.10  It  also \naligns  with  MAFF\u2019s  Agricultural  Sector  Strategic  Development  Plan  2014\u20132018  to  enhance \nagriculture productivity and diversification, and MOWRAM\u2019s Strategic Development Plan 2019\u2013\n2023 to strengthen the national hydrometeorological network, expand irrigated land by 30,000 ha \n\nPenh. \n\n \n\n6  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 2017.

ADB will also add value through investment in (i) the Sustainable Rice Platform \n(SRP) in the Stung Chinit South subproject to increase the sustainability of rice cultivation, which \nincludes activities to protect critical grassland habitats;17 and (ii) high-level technology, such as \nusing remote sensing data for water accounting, and water productivity tools in the NWRDMC to \nimprove planning in irrigation and agriculture. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  inclusive  economic  growth  through \nagriculture and irrigation attained (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: water \nand agriculture productivity in the project areas enhanced.18 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput  1:  Efficiency  and  climate  resilience  of  irrigation  systems  enhanced.  The \nproject will secure water supply for farmers by modernizing and climate proofing four irrigation \nsubprojects  covering  about  43,500  ha  of  land.  It  will  (i)  remodel  and  improve  reservoir \nembankments, drains, and main and secondary canals, and improve water-sharing arrangements \nbetween linked systems to ensure equitable water distribution for two subprojects (Kamping Pouy \nand Stung Chinit South); (ii) modernize pumping stations, drains, and main and secondary canals \nfor  two  subprojects  (Prek  Po  and  Canal  15);  (iii)  improve  farming  practices  and  promote  crop \ndiversification  through  training  in  at  least  200  demonstration  plots;  (iv)  strengthen  the  existing \nFWUC  and  form  three  additional  FWUCs  with  strong  participation  of  women,  and  help  them \ncollect  and  manage  funds  to  perform  sustainable  O&M  of  the  distribution  canals;  (v)  pilot  an \nirrigation asset management system; and (vi) help farmers in the Stung Chinit South subproject \nto achieve a premium price for rice by complying with the SRP standards. \n \nOutput 2: Water resources management improved. The project will help improve basin-\n14. \nlevel  water  resource  planning  and  investment  by  improving  data  collection,  coordination, \nmanagement, and usage. It will (i) install hydrometeorological stations to provide data for water \nresource management in Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces; (ii) establish the NWRDMC \nin  MOWRAM,  including  constructing  a  building  equipped  with  data  management  facilities \n(database  and  server,  analytical  system,  dissemination  facilities,  and  a  Doppler  radar  to  track \nextreme  weather  events);  (iii)  develop  a  WRIS  using  satellite-based  information  and  ground \nobservation as a common platform for sharing data; (iv) train MOWRAM, MAFF, and its provincial \ndepartment  staff  on  water  accounting  and  data  management;  and  (v)  provide  a  scholarship, \ninternship, training, and mentoring program in water resource management for MOWRAM staff. \n \nD. \n \n15. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $126.45 million (Table 2). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\n16. \nThe  government  has  requested  (i)  a  concessional  loan  of  $117.00  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, including $4.33 million allocation from the disaster risk reduction set-\naside of concessional ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $2.16 million from \n\n \n\n17 The Sustainable Rice Platform is a global multistakeholder platform with established standards aiming to increase \nprofitability,  productivity,  efficiency,  and  social  benefits  by  promoting  collaboration  among  government  agencies, \nfarmers, a conservation organization (Wildlife Conservation Society), and the private sector. \n\n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f5 \n\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. ADB will finance expenditures in relation to civil works, goods, \nconsulting services, training, and incremental operating costs. The HLTF (footnote 1) will provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $1.6 million, to be administered by ADB, for consulting services to \nsupport  the  NWRDMC  and  the  WRIS.  Climate  adaptation  is  estimated  to  cost  $13.32  million \n(10.5% of the overall project cost), of which $13.19 million (99%) will be financed by ADB.19 The \ngovernment  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $5.69  million,  including  in-cash  contribution  for  land \nacquisition and resettlement and supplementary salary costs, and in-kind contribution in the form \nof counterpart staff, office accommodation, facilities, and tax exemptions for consulting services \nand goods sourced from overseas.

MOWRAM will be the executing agency. Its Department \nof Farmer Water User Communities will be the implementing agency. It has established a project \nmanagement unit (PMU). MAFF staff will coordinate the provision of agricultural support, including \naccess  to  quality  seeds  and  other  agricultural  inputs,  farmer  field  schools,  and  marketing  of \nproduce;  and  participate  in  the  SRP.  The  PMU  will  be  supported  by  project  management  and \nimplementation consultants (PMICs). The Wildlife Conservation Society, which has been working \nin the Bengal Florican Conservation Area over the last 10 years, and is a member of the SRP in \nCambodia,  both  with  demonstrated  successes,  will  be  directly  contracted  for  critical  habitat \nconservation and the SRP activities. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nTechnical  due  diligence  included  comprehensive  review  of  hydrological  and  hydraulic \nconditions, water requirements and availability, irrigation engineering aspects, agronomic issues, \nand  soil  analysis.  Design  of  the  subprojects  considered  sustainable  productivity,  irrigation \nefficiency, water conservancy, and future climate and disaster risks. Flood risk is mitigated by the \nincreased capacity of drainage canals at Kamping Pouy and Canal 15. Drought is targeted by the \ndesign of the pumping station at Prek Po on the Mekong River, which will be able to draw water \neven when the water level is extremely low. Both flood and drought risks will also be addressed \nby strengthening the reservoir weir wall at the Kamping Pouy reservoir, and the reservoir weir and \nspillway  at  the  Stung  Chinit  reservoir.  The  project-supported  hydrometeorological  stations  and \nDoppler radar will also ensure early warning of climate trends and hazards. \n\n\f7 \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n20. \nEconomic and  financial analyses  were conducted for the  proposed  four subprojects. In \naddition  to  direct  investment  costs,  O&M  costs,  associated  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement costs are included as part of the overall subproject costs. The economic benefits \nconsidered  in  the  analyses  include  increase  in  command  area,  cropping  intensity,  yield,  and, \nwhere applicable, minor changes in cropping pattern. For all subprojects, rice is the predominant \ncrop. Although secured water supply will encourage diversification to non-rice crops, the transition \nwill  likely  happen  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  Adoption  of  rice  varieties  of  higher  value, \nhowever,  can  happen  in  the  short  term  and  is  taken  into  consideration  in  the  analysis.  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  subprojects  range  from  15.1%  to  21.1%.  Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the results are robust against downside risks, including increase in project \ncosts and decrease in yield or output prices. The financial analysis indicates that the subprojects \nwill generate sufficient incremental net income for famers to finance routine O&M.21 \n \nC. \n \n21. \nAll procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan and grant, \nand the HLTF grant, will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). The overall procurement risk for the project is assessed moderate. Mitigation \nmeasures include (i) an international procurement specialist to support advance actions for works, \ngoods, and consulting contract packages for $65.51 million (51.8% of project amount); and (ii) the \nPMIC to provide on-the-job training in procurement and contract management to MOWRAM and \nto assist in developing a database to regularly update and monitor contract management plans. \n \n22. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk level for the project was substantial mainly because of (i) the PMU staff\u2019s limited \ncapacity and (ii) MOWRAM\u2019s limited internal audit capacity. To mitigate the risks, the project will \n(i)  support  PMU  staff  through  the  PMIC  and  the  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural \nDevelopment Program in financial management and accounting, procurement, and internal audit \nmonitoring and evaluation;22 (ii) install accounting software that monitors progress of contracts \nand disbursements, and train staff in its use; (iii) build MOWRAM\u2019s internal audit capacity and \nuse the terms of reference for independent auditors as agreed with the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance;  and  (iv)  prepare  a  project-specific  finance  manual,  and  enhance  the  financial \nmanagement information system. The existing organizational structure of MOWRAM is generally \nsuitable for implementing the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MOWRAM.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20).   \n\nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n \n23. \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting rural poor people in the target \ncommunes  of  the  project  provinces  where  poverty  rate  ranges  from  9.3%  to  42.5%.23  It  will \naddress sustainable use and management of water resources at the national, basin, and irrigation \n\n \n\n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2010.

It  will  provide  reliable  water  supply  for  agriculture,  increase  crop  intensity  and \nproductivity, thereby improving food security for poor people. The project will also improve the \nirrigation  efficiency  from  20%  to  55%  and  improve  water  productivity.  In  addition,  farmers  will \nreceive training in farming practices and resilience to climate change and natural hazards. \n \n24. \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will enhance women\u2019s role \nin decision-making for water management at the community level in agriculture, a sector which \nemploys the most women.24 The project will also address the gender gap in accessing agriculture \nservice support and technical training. The design and monitoring framework and gender action \nplan  include  targets  to  ensure  that  project  activities  support  women\u2019s  empowerment  and \nmainstream  gender through  women\u2019s  participation  in project  design,  training,  and employment \ngenerated  by  the  project,  and  through  participation  and  leadership  in  FWUCs.  Women  will  be \noffered  leadership  training  with  a  view  to  increasing  their  participation  to  25%  in  FWUC \nmanagement  committees.  Women  will  account  for  at  least  25%  of  local  skilled  and  unskilled \nworkers  hired  for  civil  works.25  Contractors  will  apply  labor  standards  in  accordance  with \napplicable laws and regulations of Cambodia and will guarantee equal pay for work of equal value, \nenforce zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide separate sanitation facilities for women and \nmen, and provide worker safety training. At least 40% of participants in training will be women. \nThe project will also enhance MOWRAM\u2019s capacity to mainstream gender through training and \nstrengthening management information systems to better track sex-disaggregated data. \n \nE. \n \n25. \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n26. \nEnvironment (category A). An initial environmental examination was prepared for three \nsubprojects that were categorized B for environment, and an environmental impact assessment \nand environmental management plan were prepared for the Stung Chinit South subproject which \nwas  categorized  A  for  environment.27  Both  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  were  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  10  April  2019.  The \nproject is expected to have overall environmental benefits supporting better management of water \nresources, sustainable rice production, and a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \n  \n27. \nDuring  construction,  there  will  be  localized  temporary  direct  impacts,  including  air  and \nwater pollution, noise, and dust and spoil disposal. The Stung Chinit South subproject borders a \ncritical habitat, which encompasses the Baray Bengal Florican Conservation Area. Hence, there \nis a risk of indirect induced impacts to the conservation area through expansion of the irrigated \narea, and consequent conversion of natural grassland. Identified impacts can be reduced to an \nacceptable level through the effective implementation of the biodiversity action plan included in \nthe environmental management plan and the conservation program proposed under the SRP to \nprotect  grassland  habitats,  with  support  by  the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society.  MOWRAM  has \nconsiderable experience in implementing projects financed internationally, including by ADB, and \nwill be supported by the PMIC. Consultation with stakeholders and affected people was carried \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n24 The agriculture sector employs 39.3% of Cambodian women aged 15-64, compared to the industry sector (25.2%), \nand the service sector (35.5%).

Project-related \ncomplaints will be addressed in a timely manner through a grievance redress mechanism. \n\n28. \nClimate and disaster risk. The climate and disaster risk assessment indicates that the \nproject is at medium climate risk (footnote 19). Key climate risks include increased precipitation \nintensity and variability and associated flood and drought risk. The design integrates increased \ncapacity  for  water  storage  and  dedicated  land  drainage  channels  to  remove  flood  waters  to \nimprove climate resilience. The project will also provide capacity building in water conservation, \nclimate-resilient farming practices, and disaster preparedness at the commune level. Further, by \nimproving farmers\u2019 incomes, the SRP standards will increase communities\u2019 disaster preparedness \nand ability to recover from disasters and restore livelihoods. The estimated cost of disaster risk \nreduction measures is $6.62 million. The $2.16 million grant from the Asian Development Fund \n(disaster risk reduction funding) will finance part of the weir and spillway repair for the Stung Chinit \nSouth subproject. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The preliminary designs prepared for the Prek \nPo,  Canal  15,  and  Stung  Chinit  South  subprojects  suggest  that  they  will  not  require  land \nacquisition or entail any impact on assets or livelihoods. The preliminary design prepared for the \nKamping Pouy subproject suggests that it will permanently impact 433.12 square meters of land \nand 15 households, of which nine households will be physically displaced. The draft resettlement \nplan  for  the  Kamping  Pouy  subproject  and  the  draft  resettlement  due  diligence  reports  for  the \nthree  other  subprojects  were  prepared  in  line  with the  government's  laws  and  regulations  and \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, and were disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2019. \nThey will be updated based on the detailed engineering designs.28 In total, 438 people, including \n212 women, have been consulted through meetings and gender-separate focus groups as part \nof  due  diligence  and  resettlement  planning,  and  expressed  the  need  for  improved  irrigation \ninfrastructure. Consultations will continue throughout the project life cycle. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance's  General  Department  of  Resettlement  has  the \n30. \nexperience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement impacts. With support of the PMIC, \nthe  General  Department  of  Resettlement  will  (i)  train stakeholders  on  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements  and  national  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  on  involuntary  land \nacquisition  to  build  capacity  and  awareness;  (ii)  ensure  that  any  physically  or  economically \naffected people are compensated at full replacement cost before commencement of civil works; \nand (iii) establish an effective grievance redress mechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the \nresolution of community concerns over project impacts, with attention to vulnerable people.  \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Due  diligence  concluded  there  are  no  indigenous \npeoples residing  in  the Prek  Po and  Kamping  Pouy  subproject  areas.  The  Cham  ethnic  group \nliving  in  the  command  area  of  Canal  15  subproject  (256  households)  and  Stung  Chinit  South \nsubproject (1,022 households) are well-integrated in the Khmer society, have identity cards, and \nenjoy the  same  benefits  as  the  mainstream  Khmer  population.  These  two  subprojects  will  not \ndirectly  or  indirectly  affect  the  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood  systems,  or  culture  of  the  local \nCham  ethnic  group,  nor  will  they  affect  the  territories  or  natural  or  cultural  resources  that  this \ngroup  owns,  uses,  or  occupies.  The  due  diligence  reports  have  been  prepared  for  these  two \nsubprojects and disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2019.29 The reports will be updated \nonce the detailed engineering designs of the subprojects are available. \n\n28 Resettlement Plan for Kamping Pouy Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Due Diligence Report on Ethnic Minorities for Canal 15 Subproject; and Due Diligence Report on Ethnic Minorities \n\nfor Stung Chinit South Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInherent risk related to the \ncountry\u2019s inconsistent application of \nthe financial reporting standards \nused to prepare project financial \nstatements \nWeak internal audit function and \nlimited staff capacity in MOWRAM \n\nPMU has insufficient qualified staff \nto efficiently undertake the \nprocurement for the project \nInadequate planning and funding of \nO&M from irrigation service fees \n\nMitigation Measures \nADB and other development partners have been supporting the government to \nupdate its national financial reporting standards to fully align with the IPSAS. A \ndraft roadmap has been submitted to ADB by the government to show its plans \nand commitments to transition towards the IPSAS cash basis. ADB will continue \nto resolve this issue through implementation of the time-bound roadmap. \nThe project will (i) provide training in financial management and accounting, \nprocurement, and internal audit monitoring and evaluation; (ii) install and \nprovide training in accounting software; and (iii) prepare a project finance \nmanual and enhance the financial management information system. \nAdvance actions for works and goods contracts and recruitment of all \nproject consultants are undertaken.
