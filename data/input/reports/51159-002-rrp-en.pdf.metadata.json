THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia, for the Irrigated Agriculture Improvement \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)1 for the Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project will assist the Government of Cambodia to (i) modernize and improve the \nclimate and disaster resilience of four irrigation systems\u2014Kamping Pouy in Battambang province, \nPrek Po in Kampong Cham province, Stung Chinit South in Kampong Thom province, and Canal \n15 in Takeo province\u2014to supply water to 43,500 hectares (ha) for more than 290,000 people, of \nwhom more than half are women; (ii) ensure sustainability of these irrigation schemes by \nstrengthening the institutional and financial capacity of the government staff and farmer water \nuser communities (FWUCs) in operation and maintenance (O&M); (iii) improve farming practices \nfor increased agricultural productivity and crop diversification; and (iv) establish a national water \nresources data management center (NWRDMC), a water resources information system (WRIS), \nand an irrigation asset management system for better water resources management, planning, \noperations, and investment.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Agriculture  sector  performance.  Agriculture  is  a  crucial  sector  in  the  Cambodian \neconomy, contributing to  24.9% of the gross domestic product  (GDP) in 2018.2 While the \nagriculture sector growth slowed down from 4.7% per annum during 2006\u20132012 to 1.1% per \nannum  during  2014\u20132017,  it  remains  the  backbone  of  rural  livelihoods  and  has  played  a \nsignificant role in poverty reduction (footnote 2). The average poverty rate for rural areas in \nCambodia has been reduced from 53% in 2007 to 20% in 2012 largely thanks to the development \nof the agriculture sector.3 However, the number of vulnerable people remains high; the loss of \nonly $0.30 per day in income would bring Cambodia\u2019s poverty rate back up to 40%.4  \n \n4.  Inadequate irrigation infrastructure. One of the main reasons for the sector\u2019s under-\nperformance is poor agricultural production infrastructure, which severely limits cropping intensity \nand crop diversification. Of the 3.98 million ha of agriculture land, only about 1.30 million ha are \nlocated  within  the  command  area  of  2,480  irrigation  systems.5  90%  of  the  systems  are \nunderperforming or dysfunctional, mainly because of the lack of (i) proper design; (ii) a farm-level \ndistribution system; and (iii) consideration for crop water requirements, water availability, and \nhydraulic conditions. As a result, dry season rice crop only accounted for about 18% of total rice \nproduction in Cambodia as farmers only have water for wet season rice, and are not willing to \n \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Phnom Penh. \n \n ", "2 \ninvest in higher-value crops due to unreliable water supply.6 \n5.  Natural hazards such as floods and droughts occur annually. There are annual water \nshortages because of the climate, topography, limited water storage, and accessibility, especially \nin the Tonle Sap river basin. During the wet season, extensive flooding and flash floods cause \ninfrastructure damage and waterborne diseases. Climate change is likely to intensify storms and \nextend the number of consecutive dry days during the wet season, and cause hotter days during \nthe dry season. Annual rainfall is projected to increase by 3.6%\u20134.8% by 2050, whereas the \nnumber of wet days is projected to decrease by 3.7%\u20137.4%.7 This will likely lead to even greater \npressure on water supplies during the dry season and flood management during the wet season. \n \n6.  Inadequate operation and maintenance. As agriculture is the biggest water user in \nCambodia, the efficient, effective, and sustainable management of the country\u2019s water resources \ndepends largely on irrigation systems\u2019 performance.8 Thus, it is important to improve O&M cost \nrecovery using the user pays principle, and sustain the increases in agricultural productivity \nthrough strengthening capacity of government agencies, as well as establishing and closely \ninvolving the FWUCs in the design, implementation, and O&M of irrigation systems to decrease \ndependence on the state budget for O&M. \n \n7.  Poor water data, low capacity, and limited institutional coordination. Cambodia\u2019s \nhydrometeorological monitoring network is limited with poor and incomplete water data records. \nInitial water accounting work using remote sensing data was supported by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), but more detailed basin water resource assessments are essential to  inform \ninvestment decisions.9 The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) and its \nprovincial departments lack resources to sustainably manage water resources and effectively \ndevelop irrigation. The lack of data on water resources and irrigation and weak institutional \ncoordination also pose challenges for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) \nin promoting crop diversification and the shift to higher-value crops. \n \n8.  The project will address the agricultural production constraints and reduce disaster risk by \n(i) modernizing irrigation systems to improve water storage during drought and manage water \nduring  flood  events,  (ii)  upgrading  agricultural  support  services  in  crop  diversification,  (iii) \nestablishing a financial and organizational system for FWUCs to increase their role in O&M, and \n(iv) establishing the NWRDMC and WRIS and supporting their operations. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project will contribute to achieving targets defined in the government\u2019s \nRectangular Strategy IV, which aims to develop the country\u2019s irrigated land and manage its water \nresources more effectively, and reduce Cambodia\u2019s vulnerability to natural hazards.10 It also \naligns with MAFF\u2019s Agricultural Sector Strategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018 to enhance \nagriculture productivity and diversification, and MOWRAM\u2019s Strategic Development Plan 2019\u2013\n2023 to strengthen the national hydrometeorological network, expand irrigated land by 30,000 ha \n \n6  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 2017.

The project will collaborate with other projects financed by \nADB and other development partners.13 It will establish FWUCs in all of the four subprojects \n(Canal 15, Kamping Pouy, Prek Po, and Stung Chinit South), capitalizing on FWUCs reforms \nunder  the  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Development  Program,  and  will  receive \ntechnical support on O&M for the Prek Po subproject from the Australia-financed Cambodia \nAgricultural Value Chain Program.14 The NWRDMC will also incorporate (i) satellite images to be \nprovided by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, and (ii) data from all hydrometeorological \nstations in the country, including those data from the World Bank.15 Further, by enhancing crop \nproduction, the project will supply inputs to the agriculture value chains invested in by other ADB-\nfinanced projects.16 \n \n11.  Lessons learned and value added by ADB. The project incorporates key lessons from \npast irrigation projects by (i) engaging FWUCs from the early stages of designing the irrigation \nsystems; (ii) investing extensively in FWUCs so that they become self-reliant organizations \ncapable of collecting irrigation service fees and managing funds for O&M; and (iii) ensuring close \ncoordination between MOWRAM and MAFF in irrigation and agriculture so that farmers benefit \n \n11 Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 2015.

ADB will also add value through investment in (i) the Sustainable Rice Platform \n(SRP) in the Stung Chinit South subproject to increase the sustainability of rice cultivation, which \nincludes activities to protect critical grassland habitats;17 and (ii) high-level technology, such as \nusing remote sensing data for water accounting, and water productivity tools in the NWRDMC to \nimprove planning in irrigation and agriculture. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth through \nagriculture and irrigation attained (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: water \nand agriculture productivity in the project areas enhanced.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Efficiency and climate resilience of irrigation systems enhanced. The \nproject will secure water supply for farmers by modernizing and climate proofing four irrigation \nsubprojects  covering  about  43,500  ha  of  land.  It  will  (i)  remodel  and  improve  reservoir \nembankments, drains, and main and secondary canals, and improve water-sharing arrangements \nbetween linked systems to ensure equitable water distribution for two subprojects (Kamping Pouy \nand Stung Chinit South); (ii) modernize pumping stations, drains, and main and secondary canals \nfor two subprojects (Prek Po and Canal 15); (iii) improve farming practices and promote crop \ndiversification through training in at least 200 demonstration plots; (iv) strengthen the existing \nFWUC and form three additional FWUCs with strong participation of women, and help them \ncollect and manage funds to perform sustainable O&M of the distribution canals; (v) pilot an \nirrigation asset management system; and (vi) help farmers in the Stung Chinit South subproject \nto achieve a premium price for rice by complying with the SRP standards. \n \n14.  Output 2: Water resources management improved. The project will help improve basin-\nlevel  water  resource  planning  and  investment  by  improving  data  collection,  coordination, \nmanagement, and usage. It will (i) install hydrometeorological stations to provide data for water \nresource management in Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces; (ii) establish the NWRDMC \nin  MOWRAM,  including  constructing  a  building  equipped  with  data  management  facilities \n(database and server, analytical system, dissemination facilities, and a Doppler radar to track \nextreme weather events); (iii) develop a WRIS using satellite-based information and ground \nobservation as a common platform for sharing data; (iv) train MOWRAM, MAFF, and its provincial \ndepartment staff on water accounting and data management; and (v) provide a scholarship, \ninternship, training, and mentoring program in water resource management for MOWRAM staff. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $126.45 million (Table 2). \n \n16.  The government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $117.00 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, including $4.33 million allocation from the disaster risk reduction set-\naside of concessional ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $2.16 million from \n \n17 The Sustainable Rice Platform is a global multistakeholder platform with established standards aiming to increase \nprofitability, productivity, efficiency, and social benefits by promoting collaboration among government agencies, \nfarmers, a conservation organization (Wildlife Conservation Society), and the private sector. \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. ADB will finance expenditures in relation to civil works, goods, \nconsulting services, training, and incremental operating costs. The HLTF (footnote 1) will provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $1.6 million, to be administered by ADB, for consulting services to \nsupport the NWRDMC and the WRIS. Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $13.32 million \n(10.5% of the overall project cost), of which $13.19 million (99%) will be financed by ADB.19 The \ngovernment will finance the equivalent of $5.69 million, including in-cash contribution for land \nacquisition and resettlement and supplementary salary costs, and in-kind contribution in the form \nof counterpart staff, office accommodation, facilities, and tax exemptions for consulting services \nand goods sourced from overseas.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n19.  Technical due diligence included comprehensive review of hydrological and hydraulic \nconditions, water requirements and availability, irrigation engineering aspects, agronomic issues, \nand  soil  analysis.  Design  of  the  subprojects  considered  sustainable  productivity,  irrigation \nefficiency, water conservancy, and future climate and disaster risks. Flood risk is mitigated by the \nincreased capacity of drainage canals at Kamping Pouy and Canal 15. Drought is targeted by the \ndesign of the pumping station at Prek Po on the Mekong River, which will be able to draw water \neven when the water level is extremely low. Both flood and drought risks will also be addressed \nby strengthening the reservoir weir wall at the Kamping Pouy reservoir, and the reservoir weir and \nspillway at the Stung Chinit reservoir. The project-supported hydrometeorological stations and \nDoppler radar will also ensure early warning of climate trends and hazards. ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Economic and financial analyses were conducted for the proposed four subprojects. In \naddition  to  direct  investment  costs,  O&M  costs,  associated  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement costs are included as part of the overall subproject costs. The economic benefits \nconsidered in the analyses include increase in command area, cropping intensity, yield, and, \nwhere applicable, minor changes in cropping pattern. For all subprojects, rice is the predominant \ncrop. Although secured water supply will encourage diversification to non-rice crops, the transition \nwill likely happen over the medium to long term. Adoption of rice varieties of higher value, \nhowever, can happen in the short term and is taken into consideration in the analysis. The \neconomic internal rates of return for the subprojects range from 15.1% to 21.1%. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the results are robust against downside risks, including increase in project \ncosts and decrease in yield or output prices. The financial analysis indicates that the subprojects \nwill generate sufficient incremental net income for famers to finance routine O&M.21 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB loan and grant, \nand the HLTF grant, will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). The overall procurement risk for the project is assessed moderate. Mitigation \nmeasures include (i) an international procurement specialist to support advance actions for works, \ngoods, and consulting contract packages for $65.51 million (51.8% of project amount); and (ii) the \nPMIC to provide on-the-job training in procurement and contract management to MOWRAM and \nto assist in developing a database to regularly update and monitor contract management plans. \n \n22.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk level for the project was substantial mainly because of (i) the PMU staff\u2019s limited \ncapacity and (ii) MOWRAM\u2019s limited internal audit capacity. To mitigate the risks, the project will \n(i)  support  PMU  staff  through  the  PMIC  and  the  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural \nDevelopment Program in financial management and accounting, procurement, and internal audit \nmonitoring and evaluation;22 (ii) install accounting software that monitors progress of contracts \nand disbursements, and train staff in its use; (iii) build MOWRAM\u2019s internal audit capacity and \nuse the terms of reference for independent auditors as agreed with the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance;  and  (iv)  prepare  a  project-specific  finance  manual,  and  enhance  the  financial \nmanagement information system. The existing organizational structure of MOWRAM is generally \nsuitable for implementing the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the  government and MOWRAM. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20).   \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n23.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting rural poor people in the target \ncommunes of the project provinces where poverty rate ranges from 9.3% to 42.5%.23 It will \naddress sustainable use and management of water resources at the national, basin, and irrigation \n \n21 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2010.

It will provide reliable water supply for agriculture, increase crop intensity and \nproductivity, thereby improving food security for poor people. The project will also improve the \nirrigation efficiency from 20% to 55% and improve water productivity. In addition, farmers will \nreceive training in farming practices and resilience to climate change and natural hazards. \n \n24.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and will enhance women\u2019s role \nin decision-making for water management at the community level in agriculture, a sector which \nemploys the most women.24 The project will also address the gender gap in accessing agriculture \nservice support and technical training. The design and monitoring framework and gender action \nplan  include  targets  to  ensure  that  project  activities  support  women\u2019s  empowerment  and \nmainstream gender through women\u2019s participation in project design, training, and employment \ngenerated by the project, and through participation and leadership in FWUCs. Women will be \noffered  leadership  training  with  a  view  to  increasing  their  participation  to  25%  in  FWUC \nmanagement committees. Women will account for at least 25% of local skilled and unskilled \nworkers  hired  for  civil  works.25  Contractors  will  apply  labor  standards  in  accordance  with \napplicable laws and regulations of Cambodia and will guarantee equal pay for work of equal value, \nenforce zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide separate sanitation facilities for women and \nmen, and provide worker safety training. At least 40% of participants in training will be women. \nThe project will also enhance MOWRAM\u2019s capacity to mainstream gender through training and \nstrengthening management information systems to better track sex-disaggregated data. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n26.  Environment (category A). An initial environmental examination was prepared for three \nsubprojects that were categorized B for environment, and an environmental impact assessment \nand environmental management plan were prepared for the Stung Chinit South subproject which \nwas  categorized  A  for  environment.27  Both  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nenvironmental impact assessment were disclosed on the ADB website on 10 April 2019. The \nproject is expected to have overall environmental benefits supporting better management of water \nresources, sustainable rice production, and a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \n  \n27.  During construction, there will be localized temporary direct impacts, including air and \nwater pollution, noise, and dust and spoil disposal. The Stung Chinit South subproject borders a \ncritical habitat, which encompasses the Baray Bengal Florican Conservation Area. Hence, there \nis a risk of indirect induced impacts to the conservation area through expansion of the irrigated \narea, and consequent conversion of natural grassland. Identified impacts can be reduced to an \nacceptable level through the effective implementation of the biodiversity action plan included in \nthe environmental management plan and the conservation program proposed under the SRP to \nprotect grassland habitats, with support by the Wildlife Conservation Society. MOWRAM has \nconsiderable experience in implementing projects financed internationally, including by ADB, and \nwill be supported by the PMIC. Consultation with stakeholders and affected people was carried \n \n24 The agriculture sector employs 39.3% of Cambodian women aged 15-64, compared to the industry sector (25.2%), \nand the service sector (35.5%).

", "9 \nout  during project  preparation  and  will  be  continued  during  implementation.  Project-related \ncomplaints will be addressed in a timely manner through a grievance redress mechanism. \n28.  Climate and disaster risk. The climate and disaster risk assessment indicates that the \nproject is at medium climate risk (footnote 19). Key climate risks include increased precipitation \nintensity and variability and associated flood and drought risk. The design integrates increased \ncapacity for water storage and dedicated land drainage channels to remove flood waters to \nimprove climate resilience. The project will also provide capacity building in water conservation, \nclimate-resilient farming practices, and disaster preparedness at the commune level. Further, by \nimproving farmers\u2019 incomes, the SRP standards will increase communities\u2019 disaster preparedness \nand ability to recover from disasters and restore livelihoods. The estimated cost of disaster risk \nreduction measures is $6.62 million. The $2.16 million grant from the Asian Development Fund \n(disaster risk reduction funding) will finance part of the weir and spillway repair for the Stung Chinit \nSouth subproject. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The preliminary designs prepared for the Prek \nPo,  Canal  15, and  Stung  Chinit  South  subprojects  suggest that  they  will  not require  land \nacquisition or entail any impact on assets or livelihoods. The preliminary design prepared for the \nKamping Pouy subproject suggests that it will permanently impact 433.12 square meters of land \nand 15 households, of which nine households will be physically displaced. The draft resettlement \nplan for the Kamping Pouy subproject and the draft resettlement due diligence reports for the \nthree other subprojects were prepared in line with the government's laws and regulations and \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, and were disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2019. \nThey will be updated based on the detailed engineering designs.28 In total, 438 people, including \n212 women, have been consulted through meetings and gender-separate focus groups as part \nof due diligence and resettlement planning, and expressed the need for improved irrigation \ninfrastructure. Consultations will continue throughout the project life cycle. \n \n30.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance's General Department of Resettlement has the \nexperience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement impacts. With support of the PMIC, \nthe General Department of Resettlement will (i) train stakeholders on ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements and national legal and regulatory requirements on involuntary land \nacquisition to build capacity and awareness; (ii) ensure that any physically or economically \naffected people are compensated at full replacement cost before commencement of civil works; \nand (iii) establish an effective grievance redress mechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the \nresolution of community concerns over project impacts, with attention to vulnerable people.  \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence concluded there are no indigenous \npeoples residing in the Prek Po and Kamping Pouy subproject areas. The Cham ethnic group \nliving in the command area of Canal 15 subproject (256 households) and Stung Chinit South \nsubproject (1,022 households) are well-integrated in the Khmer society, have identity cards, and \nenjoy the same benefits as the mainstream Khmer population. These two subprojects will not \ndirectly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of the local \nCham ethnic group, nor will they affect the territories or natural or cultural resources that this \ngroup owns, uses, or occupies. The due diligence reports have been prepared for these two \nsubprojects and disclosed on the ADB website on 12 August 2019.29 The reports will be updated \nonce the detailed engineering designs of the subprojects are available. \n \n28 Resettlement Plan for Kamping Pouy Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Due Diligence Report on Ethnic Minorities for Canal 15 Subproject; and Due Diligence Report on Ethnic Minorities \nfor Stung Chinit South Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.
