Conversion of $286,000,000 into a tranche to finance tranche 2 of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project1 in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, as \nset out in the periodic financing request report,2 is proposed for Board consideration. \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  The project constructs a 57.1-kilometer (km) expressway between Ben Luc and Long \nThanh in the south of Ho Chi Minh City as a short link of the Greater Mekong Subregion \nSouthern Economic Corridor. The executing agency is the Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n(VEC),  which  was  established  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  to  develop  the  national \nexpressway network in Viet Nam. The project expressway is divided into a western section \n(21.14 km), a middle section (10.71 km), and an eastern section (25.25 km). The project is \nestimated to cost $1.608 billion.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a multitranche financing facility (MFF) for \n$636.0 million to finance civil works, VEC\u2019s laboratory, consulting services, and incremental \nadministration costs for the western and eastern sections on 14 December 2010. The MFF \nconsists of two tranches, and Management approved tranche 1 of the MFF ($350.0 million) on \n22 December 2010. Through a periodic financing request for tranche 2 dated 24 September \n2015, the government requested a loan of $286.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the construction of the eastern section of the project. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) cofinances $635.0 million to fund civil works and project supervision \nconsulting services for the middle section, and expressway facilities. The government allocated \n$337.0 million to fund land acquisition and resettlement as well as works to clear unexploded \nordnance along the entire expressway, and the local taxes imposed on the aforementioned \nJICA cofinancing components.   \n4.  The safeguard categorization for the project is A for environment. An environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA), prepared at the time of MFF processing to meet the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), was cleared by ADB in 2010. The EIA (i) covers all \nsections of the expressway, (ii) describes the environmental baseline conditions in the project \narea,  and  (iii)  provides  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  potential  physical,  biological,  and \nsocioeconomic  impacts  resulting  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project.  The \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) in the EIA specifies various mitigation and pollution \ncontrol measures to minimize the anticipated negative impacts of project implementation. The \nEMP\u2019s environmental monitoring plan covers the preconstruction, construction, and operation of \nthe project. The Safeguard Policy Statement applies to all sections, including the JICA-funded \nmiddle section. The government and VEC assure compliance with the EIA. VEC also ensures \ncompliance with the EMP by both ADB- and JICA-funded contractors. \n5.  Project implementation under tranche 1 was delayed because of insufficient allocation of \ncounterpart funds and late procurement of the civil works packages. The civil works contracts \nfor the western section started in May 2015. The JICA-funded civil works contract for the middle \nsection started in October 2014. The government now guarantees that counterpart funds will be \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh \nExpressway Project. Manila. \n2 Periodic Financing Request Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in the Appendix). \n ", "2    \n \nprovided for the project in a timely manner and increased in case of any shortfall in financing, so \nthat the project can be completed on time. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \n6.  VEC,  with  assistance  from  the  project  supervision  consultants,  undertakes  monthly \nmonitoring of the contractors\u2019 environmental performance and compiles the results in quarterly \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  submitted  to  ADB.  Such  monitoring  will  be  carried  out \nthroughout the construction of the project expressway and during its first year of operation. The \nexternal environmental monitoring consultant will submit the corresponding external monitoring \nreports simultaneously to ADB and VEC. Findings of due diligence on the construction activities \nshow that the civil works contractor for the middle section generally complies with the EMP. The \ncontractor has implemented measures to rectify noncompliance issues identified during due \ndiligence, e.g., concerning waste disposal, excavated soil disposal, noise, and dust. \n7.  About 12.5 hectares (ha) of mangroves within the right-of-way (ROW) of the project \nexpressway  in  the  eastern  section  (under  tranche  2)  had  originally  been  registered  as  a \nprotected forest under the management of the Protected Forest Management Unit of Long \nThanh District in Dong Nai Province. The Protected Forest Management Unit de-protected the \nmangroves within the ROW on 18 December 2013, and VEC paid compensation to the Long \nThanh District People\u2019s Committee on 3 January 2014. The mangroves were pruned by the \nprovince in April 2014. The ADB-cleared EIA states that the estimated mangrove forest area to \nbe cut for the construction of a viaduct in the eastern section would be about 1 ha. However, \naccording to estimates by the detailed design consultant, about 9.1 ha of mangroves will be \naffected by the works, although only about 0.9 ha will be permanently cleared to build the \nviaduct piers; the remaining 8.2 ha will be used temporarily for access roads and construction \nyards.  \n8.  ADB requested VEC in May 2015 to assess the damage to the mangroves, and VEC \nprepared the following environmental corrective action plan: (i) VEC will carry out mangrove \nreplantation equivalent to 12.5 ha in vacant areas of the Long Thanh protected forest; (ii) no \nfurther mangrove areas will be cut and cleared; (iii) temporary access roads and construction \nyards may be established only within the ROW, and their total area shall not be more than 8.2 \nha; and (iv) after completion of civil works, the hydrological condition along the ROW will be \nrestored to allow regrowth of mangrove stands. It is considered that the proposed environmental \ncorrective action plan will adequately manage the impacts to mangroves during the construction \nphase. \n9.  Tranche 2 has undergone the applicable business processes for subsequent tranches of \nMFFs. The project scope remains unchanged. The EIA cleared by ADB in 2010 can be applied \nto tranche 2. Upon Board approval, the project team will request Management approval of the \nconversion of a portion of the MFF into financing for tranche 2. \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n10.  The President recommends that the Board authorize the conversion of $286,000,000 \ninto a tranche to finance tranche 2 of the Greater Mekong Subregion Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh \nExpressway Project in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n   ", "          \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=2015-Tranche Report \n \n \n1.
