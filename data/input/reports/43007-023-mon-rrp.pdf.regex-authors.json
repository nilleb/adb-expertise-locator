I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Higher Education Reform Project.  \n  \n2.  The project1 will institute needed reforms in higher education to (i) improve (a) the quality \nand relevance of higher education programs; and (b) governance, management and financing of \nhigher education institutions (HEIs) and the entire subsector; and (ii) promote equitable access \nto higher education. Project interventions include institutional capacity building, human resource \ndevelopment, provision of learning and research facilities, equipment and materials, consultant \nservices, minor civil works, support for public\u2013private partnerships (PPP), and improvement of \nthe higher education policy environment. \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Rapid  economic  expansion  has  led  to  increased  demand  and  supply  for  higher \neducation  in  Mongolia.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  emphasized  the  value  of  higher \neducation  as  a  principal  investment  option  for  the  country\u2019s  long-term  economic \ncompetitiveness. The gross enrollment ratio for higher education rose from 27% in 2000 to 47% \nin 2007, supported by private higher education institutions beginning in the 1990s. Over 100 \nHEIs are now in operation, but only around 40% of graduates are employed. Persistent rural\u2013\nurban  inequalities  also undermine  Mongolia\u2019s  competitiveness  in  higher  education.  Poverty \nserves to destabilize children\u2019s school performance in rural areas; even if poor households \nmanage to send their children to HEIs in urban areas, there is no guarantee they will be \nemployable after graduation. The government's vision is of an effective higher education system \nthat  can  help  accelerate  sustainable  economic  development,  improve  people's  livelihoods, \nensure social equality, and reduce poverty. However, the system is currently constrained by (i) \nlow quality and relevance; (ii) weak governance and management; (iii) inadequate financing; \nand (iv) limited opportunities in the higher education subsector, particularly for the poor and \nthose in rural areas. \n \n4.  Low quality and relevance, and weak quality assurance. Over the last 2 decades\u2014\nas Mongolia progressed from a command to a market economy, and experienced rapid growth \nin  the  higher  education  subsector\u2014higher  education  has  fallen  behind  in  its  mission  of \ndelivering high-quality and relevant education. Higher education teachers, program offerings, \nand teaching and learning processes were unable to adapt to technological and knowledge-\nbased developments, and structural changes in labor market demand. This has led to a growing \nnumber of unemployed graduates, because many HEIs offer low-cost, low-quality programs \ndesigned mainly to attract students and generate profit for the HEIs. The professionalism and \nskill levels of higher education graduates are inadequate, and there is a mismatch between HEI \noutputs and labor market demands. There is little initiative by the public  higher education \nsubsector to forge linkages with the business sector in areas needed by industry. Generally, \ncurriculum development is not given priority in faculty management, and curriculum review is not \nrigorously undertaken within individual HEIs or across the broader higher education system. As \ncurrently structured, the higher education system in Mongolia does not foster innovation or \nprovide skilled labor, thereby constraining knowledge creation. \n                                                \n1  The project was prepared through a project preparatory technical assistance grant (Asian Development Bank \n[ADB]. 2009. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Strengthening Higher and Vocational Education. Manila [TA \n7333-MON, for $600,000, approved on 21 August]). \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  The National Council for Education Accreditation (NCEA)2 is chaired by the minister who \nheads the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) and many of its board members \nare themselves either owners or trustees of HEIs, which could lead to potential conflicts of \ninterest. While the accreditation process is well-defined, there are implementation lapses and \nthere is no systematic monitoring of follow-up actions recommended by the external evaluation \nteam.  Moreover,  only  about  40%  of  HEIs  have  national  institutional  accreditation,  as \naccreditation is not mandatory. There is a need to review NCEA policies and practices, ensure \nindependence from government and vested interests, and align business processes according \nto sound corporate governance principles. In view of dynamic changes in the subsector, NCEA \nalso needs to review its institutional setup and capacity, and take stock of whether it is able to \naddress  the  evolving  higher  education  quality  assurance  requirements  and  carry  out  its \nmandate, given the existing organizational setup. \n \n6.  Low staff quality and inadequate learning and research environment. Most HEI \nstaff are either inadequately trained or have fallen behind in their qualifications and skills. As a \nconsequence, higher education graduates have inadequate professional expertise and technical \nskills. HEIs remain uncompetitive by international standards in terms of their research capability. \nInternational partnerships have often resulted in limited cooperation, with little or no benefit to \neither  side  because  they  are  seldom  adequately  resourced  or  well  structured.  Teaching \nmethods and learning and research environments need to be greatly improved by investing in \nmodern facilities and equipment, and upgrading staff skills through training. \n \n7.  Ineffective governance and management, lack of autonomy, and weak leadership. \nThe current HEI system in Mongolia is characterized as  highly bureaucratic, because vital \nacademic, financial, and management decisions need to be approved by either MECS or the \nprivate owners of HEIs. Their decision-making power is not usually restrained by any external \nbody. Both public and private HEIs lack a strong accountability mechanism for academic and \nmanagement decisions. In addition, the management of HEIs lack strategic vision, capacity, and \nincentives  to  manage  their  funds  efficiently,  because  there  is  no  system  holding  them \naccountable  for  the  quality  of  the  graduates  trained  in  their  institutions.  The  prevailing \nenvironment surrounding HEIs does not stimulate competition. \n \n8.  Inadequate financing. The bulk of the government's education budget is allocated to \nprimary and secondary education; higher education receives just 12% of the amount budgeted \nfor the education sector, leaving HEIs highly dependent on income generated from tuition fees. \nPrivate HEIs receive almost 60% of their funding from tuition fees, and public HEIs almost 58%.3 \nGovernmental pressure on both public and private HEIs keeps tuition fees low, generally below \n$1,000 per year. As a consequence, most HEIs admit too many students, many of whom are \nunderqualified  for  higher  education,  in  order  to  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  pay  their \nacademic and administrative staff. Most HEIs lack the financial capacity to attract qualified and \nwell-trained teachers and researchers and to invest in up-to-date equipment, libraries, and \nlaboratories. This has led to a low-cost, low-quality higher education system. \n \n                                                \n2 Originally established as the National Council for Higher Education Accreditation as per Government Resolution No. \n240, 1997, and reconstituted into the NCEA in 2004. \n3  Additionally, the state training fund (STF) provides about 28% of funding to higher education through the provision \nof grants and loans to help offset the cost of education for about 40% of higher education students. However, the \ntargeting of these subsidies is sometimes inappropriate and the STF's grant and loan mechanisms need to be \nreviewed. ", "3 \n \n9.  Lack of equity and access. Socioeconomic and gender disparities in access to higher \neducation persist, resulting in low representation of males and students from poor families, \nespecially in rural areas. The gender imbalance in higher education enrollment favors females \n(60.4%), while the employment market favors males, with a national labor force employment \nrate of 67.5% for males and 58.3% for females. More males are also engaged at a decision-\nmaking level. Even in HEIs, a majority of board members are male, and only about 31% of HEI \nmanagement are female. For disadvantaged students (e.g., the poor and those from rural \nareas), fundamental problems include a lack of information on how to avail the programs, \ninappropriate targeting of state subsidies, bureaucracy, and unfriendliness among faculty and \npeers at the local level. \n \n10.  Discussions on higher education policy reforms have been ongoing for years.4 In 2009 \nthe  newly  elected  government  emphasized  the  value  of  higher  education  as  a  principal \ninvestment option for the country\u2019s long-term competitiveness. With a strong commitment to \nhigher education reforms, concrete initiatives are now being implemented. These steps include \nreducing the numbers of public HEIs5 from 42 to 16, creating a campus development plan \n(2010\u20132021)6 for national HEIs to be at par with global standards, and strengthening linkages \nbetween education, research, and business throughout Mongolia. A major breakthrough was \nthe development of the roadmap for higher education reform (2010\u20132021)7 to guide long-term \npolicy development in the subsector. MECS, with the assistance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB),8 is currently proposing amendments to the Law on Higher Education, which include \nimprovements  to  the  legislative  framework  on  governance  and  management.  These \namendments aim to strengthen the academic and administrative autonomy of HEIs, which is a \nkey factor in implementing reform initiatives. \n \n11.  The government's objectives to address these issues and reform its higher education \nsubsector are within the framework of ADB's country partnership strategy (2011\u20132015, under \npreparation) for Mongolia, the Mongolia country operations business plan (2011\u20132013, under \npreparation), and Mongolia\u2019s National Development Strategy 2020. Further, higher education \ndevelopment  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Education  Sector  Operations  Plan  by  2020,  in \naccordance  with  the  growing  demand  for  developing  good  tertiary  education  in  ADB's \ndeveloping member counties. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila (Loans 1507-MON \nand 1508-MON and TA 2719-MON, approved on 19 December) gave recommendations to improve higher \neducation but most of the recommendations were never been put into practice. Fundamental reform has not been \nundertaken due to a lack of political will; in 1996 the priority for education sector development was basic education. \n5  The number of HEIs increased from 14 public HEIs in 1991 to a total of 146 at the end of 2009, comprising 42 \npublic and 99 private HEIs, and 5 branches of foreign HEIs. The government adopted Resolution No. 15 (dated 20 \nJanuary  2010)  with  the  objective  of  increasing  public  HEI  quality  by  reducing  their  number  and  focusing \ndevelopment resources into fewer, higher-quality HEIs.  \n6  Approved by the cabinet on 9 June 2010. \n7  Approved by the cabinet on 7 July 2010. \n8  ADB. 2009.

The project impact will be an increased number of Mongolia's globally competitive higher \neducation graduates responsive to labor market demands. The outcome will be an improved, \nwell-managed, and equitable higher education system. The project primarily involves capacity \nbuilding of the entire subsector to improve its performance. \n \nC.   Outputs \n \n13.  The project is expected to deliver the following three outputs: (i) improved quality and \nrelevance  of  higher  education  programs;  (ii)  improved  effectiveness  of  higher  education \ngovernance, management, and financing; and (iii) improved equity and access. \n \n14.  Quality and relevance. Quality assurance and accreditation will be improved through \ninstitutional strengthening of NCEA and its business processes. By the end of the project, all \nHEIs will have institutional accreditation, at least 20 programs will be nationally accredited, and \nthree  programs  in  priority  disciplines 9  will  be  internationally  accredited.  Core  minimum \ncurriculum standards and a national credit and levels system will be in place and at least 50% of \nall HEIs will be carrying out their own internal curriculum review and development. In addition to \nthe capacity building of academic and administrative staff, 22 public and private HEIs will have \nimproved facilities,  equipment,  laboratories,  and  libraries.  Research  capacity  and  output  in \npriority disciplines will be improved through the provision of modern research facilities to two \nHEIs. At least 60 joint research studies will be commissioned under the project. A national e-\nlearning center and three smaller centers will be established along with two testing centers, with \ntheir resources and services to be shared by all HEIs nationwide. \n \n15.  Relevance  to  labor  market  needs  will  be  improved  through  strengthened  industry \nlinkages and PPPs. They will be monitored under the project through four annual labor market \nsurveys and 12 tracer studies. A total of 20 new PPP and twinning arrangements with foreign \nHEIs  will  be  introduced.  The  industry  linkages  and  PPPs  will  focus  on  knowledge  and \ntechnology transfer and development of industry-ready graduates. They will (i) strengthen the \nexisting program-promotion systems of HEIs, (ii) expand internship programs in industry for \nresearchers and students to improve their employability, and (iii) strengthen HEI management \nprograms. The knowledge transfer will result in a more balanced emphasis between specialized \nknowledge and relevant workplace skills such as flexible thinking, problem solving, innovation, \nadaptability, and intercultural communications. \n \n16.  Governance, management, and financing. Reforms in autonomy, accountability, and \nsound corporate governance will be piloted in two public HEIs and subsequently rolled out to the \nremaining 14 public HEIs. Reforms to improve the quality and sustainability of private HEIs will \nbe piloted in two private HEIs and rolled out to at least 10 other private HEIs. A new institution \nwill be established under the project. The Higher Education Endowment Fund will serve as the \nmain conduit for funding of development initiatives for higher education and competitive grants10 \nto be awarded under the project.11 Financing of higher education will be improved through the \npromotion of PPPs to enhance resource mobilization at the institutional level and through the \nrationalization  of  state  funding  mechanisms,  policies,  and  practices  to  improve  targeted \n                                                \n9  The programs are (i) natural sciences, (ii) engineering and technology, and (iii) agriculture. \n10 Indicative Selection Criteria for Higher Education Institutions (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n11 Indicative Selection Criteria for Higher Education Institutions, and Organogram of Higher Education Subsector \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "5 \n \nassistance. There will be a 20% increase in the number of scholarships funded for priority \ndisciplines by the end of the project. \n \n17.  Equity  and  access.  The  project  will  provide  for the  improvement  of  state  support \nmechanisms  for  poor  students  and  students  in  rural  areas,  development  of  policies  and \nmechanisms  to  attain  and  maintain  gender  balance  in  higher  education  enrollment,  and \nexpansion of higher education outreach to rural areas. A total of four rural HEIs will be piloted to \nprovide distance education and other mechanisms to expand higher education outreach to at \nleast 2,000 rural students. The information base for key social development indicators will be \nimproved and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of those indicators will be established. \nThe project will also strengthen information dissemination and advocacy for social development \nin higher education. \n \n18.  The project will introduce market competitiveness in the higher education system, which \nis a new approach in Mongolia. Interventions will include competitive grants to assist HEIs in \nimproving their strategic planning and management, accountability, and transparency. These \nreforms  will  require  a  fundamental  change  in  the  mindsets  of  government  officials,  HEI \nmanagers, and staff, and require them to improve their knowledge and skills. The project will \nalso  include  capacity  building,  which  aims  to  improve  overall  higher  education  subsector \nperformance.  The  project  will  fully  utilize  technical  outputs  from  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  technical \nassistance (TA) in higher education,12 the recommendations of which on improving the quality \nand  management  of  HEI  examinations  will  be  implemented  under  this  project.  An  overall \nassessment of ADB\u2019s higher education loans undertaken in 2008 is highly relevant, efficient, \nand effective.13 Lending for policy support and infrastructure development is important for higher \neducation development in developing member countries. \n \n19.  The  project  will  facilitate  Mongolia\u2019s  participation  in  regional  cooperation  regarding \nhigher education. As economies in the region grow more complex and become more integrated, \ncross-border higher education plays a key role in human resource development and workforce \nmobility. The project's capacity-building activities and promotion of twinning arrangements with \nforeign HEIs will enhance Mongolia's capacity for regional cooperation.  \n \n20.  The project will rely on the existing donor coordination platform, namely the Education \nDonor Consultative Mechanism (EDCM),14 with the purpose of coordinating higher education \ndevelopment efforts and to align and harmonize donor contributions. During project preparation, \na working group on higher education and technical and vocational education subsectors was \nestablished  under the EDCM.  EDCM  members\u2014including the World Bank  and  the  United \nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization15 as well as bilateral donors  that \nprovide direct assistance to HEIs\u2014will continue their dialogue, and possibly harmonize their \nefforts in the subsector. \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  26.8%,  which \nindicates the project is economically viable.18 Overall, the project will contribute significantly to \nimproving the capacity of HEIs and HEI faculties, teachers, and administrators; developing \nresearch  activities;  and  upgrading  the  higher education  system,  which  are  all  expected  to \ndirectly impact the quality of graduates and generate positive economic gains for the economy. \nA  cost\u2013benefit  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  strong  benefits  will  likely  accrue  from  both \nincreased  employability  of  higher  education  graduates  and  improved  productivity  through \nincome generation. Other external benefits of the project, which will accrue to society at large \n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "8 \n \nand not just the direct beneficiaries of the project, are (i) improvements in teaching practices at \nHEIs, which will filter down to lower levels of the education system and thereby improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of education at these levels; (ii) improved responsiveness of the \nhigher education system to the needs of the labor market and the economy; and (iii) cost \nefficiencies at HEIs resulting from improved governance, management, and finance reforms \nunder the project. \n \n27.  Financial analysis. Public expenditures on higher education made up 2.1% of total \ngovernment expenditures in 2009. Mongolia\u2019s higher education has been financed largely by \nprivate funds through the payment of tuition fees, donations, and income generation. Tuition \nfees are the largest source of financing for public HEIs, making almost 60% of all funds. The \nState  Training  Fund  (STF)  augments  state  budgets  to  HEIs  through  loans  and  grants  to \nstudents of civil servants, and poor herders and other disadvantaged groups. Higher education \nfinancing is undermined by insufficient financial support from the government to HEIs, as well as \nby other issues: (i) the lack of a higher education financing policy; (ii) insufficient autonomy of \nHEIs at the institutional level, as the government caps tuition fees, imposes student quotas, and \ncontrols governance structures; and (iii) deficiencies in the current program of state grants and \ntuition loans. Keeping tuition fees low has made it difficult for HEIs to cover major costs for \neducational  inputs  such  as  teachers\u2019  remuneration,  improvement  of  learning  facilities,  and \nresearch activities. As a result, private providers\u2014which focus largely on low-investment, high-\nreturn programs, with little regard for maintaining quality standards\u2014have proliferated.  \n \n28.  The government\u2019s higher education budget is projected to increase by an average of \n13.2% annually from 2011 to 2015. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s annual commitment to the \nproject as a percentage of the total education budget is projected to increase from 0.44% in \nyear 1 of the project to 2.37% in year 2, and is expected to decline to 0.34% in year 5. The \ngovernment\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the higher education budget \nis  also  expected  to  initially  increase  (from  2.48%  in  year  1  to  13.45%  in  year  2)  and \nsubsequently decline (to 1.39% in year 5 of project implementation). The government\u2019s annual \ncommitment to the project is therefore deemed affordable, as its share in the project represents \nonly about 0.93% of the higher education budget, on average, over the 5-year period. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  MECS,  the  executing  agency,  has  been  a  long-term  partner  of  ADB,  and  actively \ninvolved  in  implementing  education  sector  development  projects  since  1997.  There  is  an \nongoing effort by ADB and MOF's procurement policy department to review Mongolia's standard \nbidding  documents  for  goods  and  civil  works.  ADB  carried  out  a  performance  review  of \nprocurement19 and disbursement by the executing agency in February 2010, and compliance \nreviews were done by ADB in 2009 and 2010. MECS and MOF are in the process of improving \ntheir effectiveness to follow the recommendations stemming from these assessments. During \nproject preparation, an assessment of MECS' existing project management arrangements and \ncapacity was also carried out, which confirmed that MECS has adequate capacity to conduct \nprocurement and disbursement in compliance with ADB policy and procedural requirements and \nrelevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. Audits of the executing agency\u2019s \nprocurement activities were undertaken by external auditors or the National Auditing Authority. \n                                                \n19 In the report, procurement practices were rated average and organizational structure and staff capacity, records \nmanagement, effectiveness, and accountability all received high ratings. MECS and MOF have implemented \nmitigating measures including (i) placing an officer of the Finance and Administration Department in MECS to \ncheck and facilitate procurement and disbursement, and (ii) systematic knowledge and experience sharing from \nexperienced to new staff. ", "9 \n \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MECS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  While  the  project's  support  for  reforms  in  quality,  relevance,  and  governance  and \nmanagement will benefit all higher education students and their families, the equity and access \ncomponent will specifically target poor students and those from rural areas through initiatives \nsuch as rationalizing state support mechanisms to remove financial barriers to higher education \nand  improving  higher  education  outreach  to  rural  students.  Socioeconomic  and  sex-\ndisaggregated information on the status of higher education students is not available at present \nand the project will develop a clearly defined disaggregated information base for key social \nindicators in higher education, integrate these into the national statistical system, and establish \nmechanisms for systematic information gathering, monitoring, and evaluation. By the end of the \nproject, it is envisaged that the enrollment of students from poor and rural families will increase \nby at least 5% above 2013 levels (the envisaged completion of the disaggregated data base), \nwith four rural HEIs offering distance education programs for outreach to at least 2,000 rural \nstudents. The project will also provide competitive grants for innovative approaches to address \nequity and access issues in higher education. Information and advocacy campaigns on social \nissues  in  higher  education  will  be  conducted  for  administrators,  teachers,  and  other \nstakeholders. \n \n32.  Gender  benefits. The project is designed to be classified under the gender equity \ntheme.  The  gender  action  plan20 designed  for  the  project  will  build  MECS'  capacity  for \nidentifying and addressing gender issues, eliminating gender imbalances in higher education, \nand  promoting  gender-neutral  teaching  and  learning.  The  project  will,  among  other \ninterventions, (i) develop training programs and manuals for higher education managers and \nteachers on gender sensitivity; (ii) revise curricula and learning materials to make them gender \nsensitive; (iii) develop strategies and incentives to address the gender imbalance in higher \neducation enrollment; and (iv) develop policies to promote gender balance among HEI boards, \ntop management, and the teaching staff. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. No significant impact on the environment is anticipated. No acquisition of \nland or relocation of people is planned. The simplified environmental management plan was \nprepared to ensure full mitigation of any environmental impacts of limited civil works, such as \nrehabilitation of existing laboratories and libraries supported by the project. No negative impacts \non indigenous peoples are expected. Targeting approaches under the project will be applied \nnationwide and benefit indigenous peoples. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
