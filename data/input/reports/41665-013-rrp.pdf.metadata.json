The report  also describes  proposed  administration \nof technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the UEIF under the UFPF and by the Multi-Donor \nTrust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (WFPF)2 for  capacity  building  for \nwater district development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and administration of \nthe grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.3 \n \nThe  project  will  enable  LWUA,  a  government-owned  and  controlled  specialized  lender, \n2. \nto fulfill  its mandate  to  help  less  advanced  water  districts  which  operate outside  Metro  Manila. \nThe  project  will  expand  and  rehabilitate  water  supply  systems,  build  new  sanitation  facilities, \nand  provide  capacity  development  to  strengthen  the  sustainability  of  LWUA  and  these  water \ndistricts,  and  to  promote  sanitation  partnerships  with  local  government  units  (LGUs).  Greater \naccess  to  piped  water  supply  and  improved  sanitation  will  reduce  water-related  diseases \ncaused by unsafe drinking water and the lack of sanitation facilities. \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nProvincial  water  and  sanitation  coverage  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  country\u2019s  growing \n3. \npopulation  and  needs  significant  improvement.  While  over  90%  of  Metro  Manila\u2019s  residents \nhave access to piped water, it is estimated that less than half of the people living in provincial \nareas  do.  Sanitation  remains a big  challenge  especially  outside  Metro Manila  where  there are \nno  significant  sewerage  systems  and  septic  tank  effluent  is  discharged  without  treatment, \nexposing millions to water-related diseases. Acute watery diarrhea is one of the leading causes \nof morbidity  in the  country.4 The Government  of the  Philippines  seeks  to catalyze  urban water \nsupply and sanitation to improve health and living conditions and promote inclusive growth. \n \n4. \nSector  performance.  Outside  Metro  Manila  service  is  fragmented  and  suffers  from \nweak planning, monitoring and investment. Water utilities are operated by a selection of service \nproviders,  including  (i)  water  districts,  (ii)  LGU-owned  and  operated  water  utilities,  and  (iii) \nprivate  sector  operators,  mostly  in  urbanized  areas;  and  (iv)  community-based  organizations, \nmostly in rural areas.  \n \n5. \nWater  districts  provide  about  two-thirds  of  all  provincial  piped  water  connections  and \ntherefore  can  play  an  important  role  in  expanding  coverage.  Water  districts  are  corporatized \nutilities that LGUs were encouraged to form under the 1973 Provincial Water Utilities Act. Run \nby a general manager and a five-person board of directors appointed by the mayor or governor, \neach  water  district  must  operate  on  a full  cost  recovery  basis.5 The  1973  act  also  established \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Sweden. \n2  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  Government  of  the  Philippines,  Department  of  Health  (DOH).  2012.  Field  Health  Service  Information  System, \n\nAnnual 2011. Manila. \n\n5  An LGU forms a water district after analyzing, with LWUA, the water district\u2019s likely financial viability. The LGU then \nenacts a resolution to corporatize its water supply assets and secures a conditional certificate of conformance from \n\n\fLWUA  to  help  water  districts  develop  systems  and  achieve  sustainability  through  providing  (i) \nconcessionary  loans;6 and  (ii)  engineering,  technical,  and  institutional  development  services. \nThe  act  allows  LWUA  to  take  over  water  district  management  under  special  circumstances, \npowers that LWUA has occasionally exercised to rehabilitate mismanaged districts.  \n \n6. \nIt  is  generally  accepted  that  water  districts  provide  better  service  than  utilities  run  by \nLGUs and have demonstrated more resilience after disasters, with corporatization and LWUA\u2019s \nfinancing  and  technical  assistance  as  key  success  factors.7 While  a  growing  number  of  water \ndistricts  have achieved scale  and  sustainability  and can  now  access funding from government \nbanks  and  private  sector  banks,  the  majority  of  the  506  operational  water  districts  are  small, \nwith  fewer  than  3,000  connections  and  limited  system  coverage.  Most  small  water  districts \ncannot  access  funding  from  local  banks,  and  rely  on  LWUA  for  technical,  operational,  and \ninstitutional  expertise.  Many  small  water  districts  are  characterized  by  high  nonrevenue  water \nlevels, low efficiency and profitability, and weak institutional and technical capacity. The project \nwill  stimulate  water  and  sanitation  investments,  and  help  smaller  water  districts  expand \ncoverage, reduce nonrevenue water levels, and become more efficient.8 The project will enable \nLWUA  to  extend  longer-term  loans  and  build  LWUA\u2019s  technical  capacity  in  sanitation,  while \nwater districts will be able to borrow for the first time from LWUA to finance sanitation projects. \n \n7. \nStrategic  context.  Water  districts  provide  an  established  corporatized  platform  for \nbroader  and  improved  water  and  sanitation  coverage  outside  Metro  Manila  to  help  the \ngovernment achieve its development goals for safe drinking water and improved sanitation, as \narticulated under the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016 and its Midterm Update.9 LWUA \nis  a  focal  point  to  facilitate  this.  The  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA) \nboard  approved  the  project  proposal  in  2014,  and  it  is  highlighted  in  the  government\u2019s \nRevalidated Public Investment Program.10 The project also supports the National Sewerage and \nSeptage Management Program, which aims to catalyze the installation of septage management \nsystems in all LGUs by 2020 and encourages LGUs to share costs with water districts.  \n \n8. \nAssistance  to  this  key  sector  is  part  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership strategy for the Philippines, 2011\u20132016.11  The project reinforces core principles in \nADB\u2019s  water  operational  plan,  2011\u20132020,12 fostering  corporatization  and  cost  recovery,  and \npromoting  sanitation.  The  project  meets  all  the  requirements  for  a  sector  loan: 13  (i)  the \ngovernment has a sector development plan14 and the institutional capacity to implement it, (ii) its \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe LWUA for the new water district to become eligible for LWUA\u2019s financial, technical, institutional development, \nand regulatory support.    \n\n6  Since 1973, LWUA has been funded mainly through loans from ADB and other development partners.  \n7  Most  water  districts\u2019  operations  bounced  back  faster  after  Typhoon  Yolanda  because  of  (i)  more  climate-proof \nsystems,  (ii)  stronger  technical  skills,  and  (iii)  LWUA\u2019s  institutional  assistance.  LWUA\u2019s  comprehensive  damage \nand loss assessment within a few days demonstrated its technical and institutional capacity. \n\n8  For  very  small  or  less-viable  water  districts,  the  government  will  channel  grants  for  these  water  districts  through \n\nLWUA, and the project can fund the loan portion of such loan-grant funding. \n\n9  Government  of  the  Philippines,  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA).  2014.

The \nproject is in the country operations business plan for the Philippines, 2016\u20132018.15  \n \n9. \nPrevious ADB involvement and lessons learned. LWUA has a long history of working \nwith  ADB.  From  the  1970s  to  the  1990s,  ADB  provided  LWUA  with  loans  for  six  investment \nprojects and funded five TA projects to finance water districts and strengthen institutions. Of the \nthree projects that were rated, two were successful and one was partially successful because of \ndelays  in  construction  and  a  lack  of  quantifiable  and  measurable  targets  for  project \nbeneficiaries.  This  project  will  provide  implementation  support  to  LWUA  to  avoid  the  delays \nexperienced  previously.  It  will  also  fund  a  review  of  LWUA\u2019s  corporate  planning  and  asset \nmanagement to strengthen LWUA.16 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  living  and  health  conditions  for  the  communities  outside \nMetro Manila that the participating water districts serve. The outcome will be increased access \nto safe drinking water and improved sanitation. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will finance water and sanitation investments that will improve public health \n\n11. \nin communities outside Metro Manila. The key project outputs are  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  extension  and  rehabilitation  of  water  supply  systems  of  at  least  20  water \ndistricts, including the two pilots (CKWD and MSFWD), and sanitation projects of \nat least four water districts (potentially including CKWD);17 and \ncapacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  for  LWUA,  selected  water \ndistricts, and LGUs to address planning, financial and project management, and \noperations and maintenance capacity gaps.18 \n\n \n12. \nLWUA  will  help  the  water  districts  expand  their  systems  and  achieve  sustainability, \nincluding  overseeing  the  design  of  proposed  water  intake  and  distribution  systems,  and \nsanitation facilities.  LWUA  will  prepare  feasibility  studies  and safeguard documentation for  the \nadditional subprojects. Subproject eligibility criteria is in Appendix 2 of the project administration \nmanual  (PAM).19 LWUA  will  also  organize  promotion  campaigns  and  workshops  to  encourage \nsanitation partnerships between LGUs and water districts, and integration or cooperation among \nsmaller water districts. \n \n13. \nSpecial  features. In the Philippines, scale and regulatory risk (resource and economic) \nhave deterred more private investment in water and sanitation. While the government is working \nto  establish  a  national  regulator,  corporatization  continues  to  be  the  important  first  step  for \npublic water utilities. The sector loan will strengthen water districts by funding expanded service \n                                                \n15  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n16 A project preparatory TA prepared feasibility studies and safeguard documentation for two pilot water districts: City \nof Koronadal Water District (CKWD) and Metro San Fernando (La Union) Water District (MSFWD). In August 2015, \nLWUA submitted to ADB a list of probable water subprojects totaling $60 million.  \n\n17 In 2007, following the government\u2019s request, ADB approved project preparatory TA for $1.5 million (including  $0.3 \nmillion  from  the  government). TA  consultants  were mobilized  in  2008,  five  pilot  water districts  were selected and \nfeasibility studies prepared. The final report was submitted in May 2010. In January 2012, after the appointment of \nLWUA\u2019s new management, the government renewed its interest in the project. Of the original pilot water districts, \nCKWD and MSFWD remain. \n\n18 This output is financed by the TA described in para. 20. \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\ncoverage and nonrevenue water reduction. The attached TA will provide capacity development \nto water districts and promote integration and cooperation among very small water districts. The \nproject  will  also  demonstrate  the  scalable  national  platform  that  LWUA  and  water  districts \nprovide for sanitation investments: a 20% grant will be offered for sanitation projects, and the TA \nwill promote sanitation partnerships between LGUs and water districts. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $76 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n\nItem \n\nAmounta \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \nCapacity Developmentc \n             Subtotal (A) \n\nA.

Loan  proceeds  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment,  consulting  services, \ntransportation  and  insurance,  contingencies,  and  interest  and  commitment  charges  during \nimplementation.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a grace  period  of  6  years  and  a \nstraight-line amortization; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility;20 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (interest \nand  other  charges  during  implementation  to  be  capitalized);  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \n16. \nThe  UEIF  (footnote  1)  under  UFPF  will  provide  a  $2  million  investment  grant, \nadministered  by  ADB,  to  subsidize  new  sanitation  facilities.  Making  such  projects  more \naffordable and demonstrating sustainability will catalyze other sanitation investments.  \n \n17. \nLWUA, the water districts, and the LGUs will contribute $13 million for land acquisition, \nresettlement  costs,  and  taxes  and  duties.

ADB will administer both grants.23 The TA \nwill  provide  support to  the  project  in  order  to (i)  strengthen  water  district  sustainability  through \ntraining  and  promoting  integration  and  cooperation  among  smaller  water  districts;  (ii)  promote \nsustainable  sanitation  partnerships  between  LGUs  and  the  water  districts;  and  (iii)  prepare  a \nstrategic business review of LWUA, strengthen its corporate planning capacity and redefine its \nrole  in  the  sector,  enhance  its  viability,  and  improve  its  accounting  systems  to  address  audit \nissues  raised  by  the  COA.  LWUA  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n21. \nIn  designing  sample  water  subprojects,  wells  have  been  sized  based  on  daily  peak \ndemand.  Water  supply  facilities  primarily  consist  of  (i)  submersible  pumping  systems  with \nassociated  back-up  generation  in  wells  with  sustainable  water  yields,  (ii)  suitable  chlorination \nfacilities  for  water  disinfection,  (iii)  transmission  and  distribution  networks  with  pipe  diameters \nranging  from  50  to  200  millimeters,  and  (iv)  new  service  connections.    Improved  sanitation  in \nsample subprojects will be secured through a combination of (i) desludging of septic tanks with \nvacuum trucks (with standard capacities ranging from 4 to 8 cubic meters, for ease of access to \nthe  household),  and  (ii)  septage  treatment  facilities.  The  resulting  effluent  will  meet  Class  B \nbody  discharge  standards  prescribed  by  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis. 24  The  economic  analysis  of  the  pilot  subprojects  evaluated \n22. \ntechnical options and confirmed that the subproject components are the least-cost options that \nsupport each water district\u2019s long-term development plan. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  was  computed  at  25%  for  CKWD  and  14%  for  MSFWD,  above  the  12%  economic \nopportunity cost of capital assumed by ADB. The EIRR remained above 12% for all  sensitivity \nscenarios except MSFWD\u2019s worst case scenario (increased costs and decreased benefits). The \nEIRR  would  have  been  higher  if  other  benefits  were  quantified  (i.e.,  avoided  morbidity  and \nmortality  from  other  waterborne  diseases  such  as  dysentery  and  cholera,  income  generated \nfrom the use of water for livelihood purposes, and the multiplier effect of increased income), and \nwould  likely  be  above  12%  for  MSFWD\u2019s  worst  case  scenario.  The  economic  benefits  of  the \nwater supply subprojects include (i) resource cost savings on non-incremental water in terms of \navoided costs of producing, collecting, treating, and storing non-piped water because of a shift \nin demand to  piped water  supply;  (ii)  economic value  of  incremental  water  from  the  increased \n\n                                                \n23 This TA will finance the output described in paragraph 10(ii).

Economic  costs  were  derived  from  the \nfinancial estimates of capital investments and operation and maintenance costs after eliminating \nall duties and taxes, estimating the traded and non-traded components of costs, and multiplying \nthe  net  results  by  appropriate  conversion  factors  based  on  guidelines  set  by  the  NEDA\u2019s \nInvestment  Coordination  Committee:  a  shadow  exchange  rate  for  traded  goods  of  1.2,  and  a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.6 for unskilled labor.  \n \nFinancial  analysis. 25 The  financial  cost-benefit  analysis  of  the  pilot  water  districts\u2019 \n23. \nsubprojects  confirmed  their  financial  viability.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of \nCKWD\u2019s  subprojects  (water  and  sanitation)  is  22.1%,  exceeding the  weighted  average cost of \ncapital (WACC) of 5.7%. The FIRR of MSFWD\u2019s water subproject is 7.1%. Sensitivity and risk \nanalysis revealed that the subprojects\u2019 FIRRs are most sensitive to changes in revenues (mainly \nfrom tariffs) and operating costs.  Sustainability depends heavily on the implementation of tariff \nincreases,  the  aggressive  connection  of  new  customers  (for  water  subprojects),  and  the \ncollection  of  sanitation  fees  from  customers  who  are  not  connected  to  the  water  system  (for \nsanitation subprojects). Financial analysis also confirmed that the pilot  water districts have the \nfunds  necessary  to finance  equity,  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  completed  facilities,  and \ndebt  service.  To  be  eligible  for  financing,  additional  subprojects  must  demonstrate  an  FIRR \nexceeding the relevant WACC. \n \nAs part of due diligence, LWUA\u2019s financial condition was assessed. LWUA\u2019s profitability \n24. \nand  leverage  continued  to  improve  in  the  2014  fiscal  year.  It  expects  to  operate  viably  in  the \nnext  5  years  by  (i)  reviewing  its  competitiveness  to  deter  current  borrowers  from  prepaying \nloans and  attract  new  borrowers;  (ii)  more  proactively  managing  nonperforming  loans;  and (iii) \nserving  as  a  funding  conduit  for  national  government  grants  to  smaller  water  districts  and \nwaterless communities. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe \n\nfinancial  management  assessment  concluded \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and LWUA. As a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC), \nLWUA is bound by the good governance commitments set forth in the performance agreement \ncontract between LWUA and the Governance Commission for GOCCs. \n \n26. \nthe \ntransparency  and  accountability  elements  of  good  governance.  Although  overall  risk  is  still \nsubstantial,  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  project  are  adequate.  LWUA  has \ndeveloped  reasonable  institutional  capacity to  undertake  international and national  competitive \nbidding  for  civil  works  through  its  direct  participation  and  involvement  in  procurement  for \nprevious projects financed by ADB and other official development assistance. The assessment \nof the pilot water districts indicated more limited experience; assessments will be undertaken for \nother  participating  water  districts.  Capacity  development  assistance  on  financial  management, \nfund  disbursement,  and  procurement  will  be  provided.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \n\nthat  LWUA  adheres \n\nto \n\n                                                \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nPoverty  and  social  impacts.  The  project  will  target  less-resilient  water  districts.  A \npoverty,  social,  and  gender  assessment  was  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  to \ndetermine socioeconomic characteristics and needs, as well as opportunities for participation for \nthe  pilot  area  beneficiaries.  The  poverty  incidence  in  the  pilot  water  districts  was  36%  for \nMSFWD  and  46%  for  CKWD,  with  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women  (19% \nand  34%).  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  has  been  prepared  to  identify \nmeasures  to  enhance  project  benefits  and  mitigate  potential  risks  or  negative  impacts  to  the \nproject  population.  26  The  project  has  two  main  poverty  and  inclusive  design  features:  (i) \nenforcing  LWUA\u2019s  lifeline  tariff  policy;  and  (ii)  ensuring  water  districts  have  initiatives  for \naffordable  access.  Sanitation-awareness  campaigns  and  pilot  facilities  will  reduce  the \noccurrence of waterborne and water-washed diseases and reduce associated health costs.  \n\n28. \nGender impacts. The project\u2019s gender action plan will facilitate women\u2019s participation in \nproject implementation (through the PMU) and in hygiene and sanitation training, and increase \nfemale representation on water district boards.27 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nfor \n\nis  classified  category  B \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project \n\ninvoluntary \n29. \nresettlement,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  as  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  limited.  A  resettlement  framework  (RF)28 has  been \nprepared, embodying specific requirements for all subprojects. A resettlement plan (RP) will be \ncompleted  for  each  subproject  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  financed  under \nthe  sector  loan,  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework,  as  required,  during \nimplementation.  Due  diligence  has  been  undertaken  for  all  sample  subprojects.  Public \nconsultations were conducted and an RP was prepared for MSFWD\u2019s water supply subproject \nwhich involves land acquisition; initial costs for land acquisition and resettlement including those \nfor  implementing  the  RP  have  been  estimated  and  integrated  into  the  project  cost. 29 The  RP \nfollows  a  process  consistent  with  the  SPS  and  Philippine  laws  and  regulations,  and  ensures \ncompliance with them. In line with the RF, a due diligence assessment report was prepared for \nCKWD\u2019s subprojects, which concluded that no land acquisition or resettlement were expected to \noccur.  A  designated  officer  in  the  PMU  will  monitor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimplementation.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  in \n30. \naccordance  with  the  SPS.

Public consultations have been conducted and sample \nIEEs have been prepared for all subprojects, each including an EMP that ensures mitigation of \nidentified environment impacts along with related costs. 32 \n \n32. \nAdequate incorporation of environmental considerations during design, and allocation of \nsufficient budget will mitigate potential adverse impacts during operation. Effective environment \nand social monitoring at all stages of implementation will be ensured. In compliance with ADB\u2019s \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  safeguard  documents  will  be  posted  on \nADB's  website.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  developed  and  included  in  the \nsafeguard documents to help to facilitate resolve complaints regarding project performance.  \n \nF. \n\nIntegrity \n\n33. \nIntegrity  due  diligence  has  been  conducted,  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of \nAnticorruption and Integrity, and information and clarification was obtained from LWUA and the \ngovernment. The assessment included past issues the government and LWUA are addressing; \nif the suggested robust measures are implemented and adhered to, they are unlikely to have an \nadverse  effect  on  the  project.  Appropriate  loan  covenants  have  been  included  in  the  loan \ndocuments to mitigate integrity risks. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nG. \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 33  The  project\u2019s  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nLWUA and participating water \ndistricts will not have sufficient \ncapacity to utilize funds during \nimplementation; reluctance of \nwater districts to borrow, \nespecially for sanitation. \n\nOperation of new infrastructure \nis not sustainable because of \nlow tariffs, poor collection, \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  project  will  fund  a  review  of  LWUA\u2019s  corporate  planning  and  asset \nmanagement.  LWUA is  working  with  the  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  to  address \nthe audit issues raised by COA.  \nLWUA  has  a  long  list  of  water  and  sanitation  projects.  Most  have  low  technical \ncomplexity; the more technical can be outsourced by LWUA, if necessary. \nThe  project  will  fund  capacity  building  to  enhance  sustainability  and  encourage \nsanitation  investments.  Participating  water  districts  will  be  offered  a  20% \ninvestment grant for sanitation subprojects. \nLWUA\u2019s lending policies promote full-cost pricing including setting a price per unit \nof water that covers all the costs involved in treating water and delivering it to the \ncustomer,  and  ensuring  annual  water  tariff  reviews.
