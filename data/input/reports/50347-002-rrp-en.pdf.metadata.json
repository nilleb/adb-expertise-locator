Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \n2. \nThe project will support Tajikistan in (i) rehabilitating and expanding climate-resilient water \nsupply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure,  pilot  testing  the  establishment  of  district  metering \nareas (DMAs) for nonrevenue water (NRW) management in selected districts of Dushanbe city \nand rehabilitation of the south sewage collector, benefitting 352,000 people;1 and (ii) developing \na  business  model  for  the  State  Unitary  Enterprise  Dushanbevodokanal  (DVK)  to  improve  the \nsustainability  of  operations,  including  an  accountability  and  incentive  mechanism  with  a \nperformance benchmarking matrix and smart management system. The project will pilot test a \nbehavior change component for raising public awareness on water usage and conservation and \nthe benefits of smart meters. This is the first urban sector project of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  in  Tajikistan,  demonstrating  efficient  network  management  with  potential  for  scaling  up \ncitywide. It is listed in the ADB country operations business plan for Tajikistan, 2018\u20132020.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \n Dushanbe, the capital city and economic center of Tajikistan, had an official population of \n820,000 in 2016 but almost 1 million unofficially because of increased migration from rural areas \nand a significant number of returning migrants. Urban migration has added stress to the aging \nurban infrastructure and led to unplanned spatial expansion of the city, especially in the southeast, \nwith low density patterns.3 This has caused environmental degradation, resulting in high coping \ncosts, poor livability for citizens, and limited economic growth prospects.4   \n   \nCore problem. The WSS systems in Dushanbe, built under the former Soviet Union, have \n4. \ndeteriorated because of age, lack of continued capital investment, and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Most of the population of Dushanbe has access to piped water supplied by \nDVK,  except for the  new  development  areas  in  the  southeast of the  city.  The  water  system  is \ncharacterized by intermittent operations (4\u20138 hours per day), high NRW, and low water pressure \nand energy efficiency. Disrupted supply conditions create daily shocks that damage the network \nand risks of wastewater infiltration. The expanding urban areas are not connected to the water \nand sewerage systems. Lack of public understanding of water conservation, combined with low \ntariffs, has led to uncontrolled water consumption and wastage. Water consumption is high at 330 \n\n                                                 \n1   About  one-third  of  the  city\u2019s  population  (352,000  people)  live  in  the  5,700-hectare  catchment  area  of  the  south \n\nsewage collector.  \n\n2   ADB. 2017.

Presentation  by  J.  Parkinson.  Zurich.  26  September.  The  average  per  capita  economic  impact  of \ninadequate WSS service is about $35.00 per person/year, of which $25.00 per person/year is the coping cost for not \nimproving water supply, about $3.00 per person/year is related to waterborne diseases attributable to poor water \nsupply, $4.00 per person/year is attributable to poor sanitation, and $2.00 per person/year is related to contamination \nof water resources resulting from poor sanitation; and M.

The incidence of ascariasis in Shohmansur district increased from 34 \ncases in 2015 to 53 in 2016.6   \n \n5. \nbelow:   \n\nInadequate and inefficient water supply and sanitation. The WSS system is described \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nInfrastructure. Water  in  Dushanbe  is  supplied from four  water  treatment  plants \n(WTPs) in each quadrant of the city, with a total capacity of 520,000 cubic meters \nper  day  (m3/d).  Napornaya  and  Samotechnaya  WTPs    in  the  north  (capacity  of \n204,000 m3/d) use surface water sourced from the River Varzob 16 kilometers (km) \nupstream from the city. The groundwater treatment plant in the southeast of the \ncity (Kafernigan I) was commissioned in 1972 and the Southwest WTP was built \nin  1977.  Both  rely  on  groundwater  abstraction.  The  centralized  water  supply \nsystem was built in 1932 and extended in the 1970s.   \nOperation and maintenance. The water supply coverage in Dushanbe is 83%, \nbut its service quality and reliability are poor. NRW is expected to be more than \n60%  because  of  high  physical  losses  from  the  deteriorated  infrastructure,  high \ncommercial losses, and poor operational management.7 High levels of NRW lead \nto low levels of business efficiency. About 187,000 customers are registered, of \nwhich  only  76,500  are  metered\u2014limiting  the  cost  recovery,  user  charges,  and \nsustainability of operations.  \nInstitutional  management.  DVK  cannot  cover  its  operating  or  capital  costs \nbecause  of  low  tariffs,  inefficient  operations,  and  high  debt  servicing  of  loans  in \nforeign  currency.  Skilled  technical  staff  are  lacking  in  DVK  for  technical, \nprocurement,  financial  management,  and  utility  management  because  of  high \nturnover.  DVK  needs  adequate  business  planning  and  a  competitive  incentive \nstructure to become viable. \nFinance.  Investment  is  inadequate  for  capital  and  operational  expenditure \nbecause  of  limited  municipal  revenue,  with  nominal  tariffs,  limited  metering,  low \nbilling and collection efficiency, and high costs caused by operating inefficiencies. \nEnergy  cost  is  a  significant  part  of  operational  expenditure.  Until  October  2016, \ntariffs were calculated per person based on an estimated household size of four \npersons, not volumetric consumption, leading to excessive water consumption and \nwastage. The 2017 combined tariff for 1.0 m3 of water supply and wastewater is \nlow at $0.05-$0.07 per household and $0.57 for commercial organizations.8 The \nimplementation of the tariff adjustments and universal metering are essential for \nthe financial sustainability of DVK. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2016.

NRW is the difference between \nthe  volume  of  water  put  into  a  water  distribution  system  and  the  volume  billed  to  customers.  NRW  has  three \ncomponents:  (i)  physical  losses\u2013leakage  from  all  parts  of  the  system  and  overflows  at  the  utility\u2019s  reservoirs; \n(ii) commercial  losses\u2014under-registration  of  customer meters,  data  handling  errors,  and  theft  of  water  in  various \nforms; and (iii) unbilled authorized consumption\u2014water used by the utility for operational purposes, water used for \nfirefighting, and water provided free to certain consumer groups.   \n\n8  Decree of the Department for Anti-Monopoly Policy No. 52 dated 29 June 2016.  \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fOngoing  work.

Dushanbe  has  one  sewerage  network  and  wastewater  treatment  plant \n(WWTP) built in the 1970s, which has undergone upgrades with the replacement of pumping units \nand rehabilitation of sedimentation tanks. The sewerage system is separate, without storm water \nentry,  and  operates  entirely  under  gravity  conditions.  However,  it  has  numerous  overflows  to \nwater bodies and agricultural land because of a design flaw in the south sewage collector. DVK \nestimates that 70% of the population is connected to the sewerage system and the remainder \nuses  septic  tanks.  Wastewater  undergoes  only  basic  physical  treatment  through  primary \nsettlement.  Although  the  WWTP  has  both  physical  and  biological  facilities,  only  the  physical \nfacilities are working.10  \n \nClimate change vulnerability. Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central \n8. \nAsia and the second least able to adapt (footnote 4). Its water security score fell from 2013 to \n2016 (footnote 5), raising the need for efficient use of water. Climate change adaptation needs \nfor  the  water  supply  sector  include  reducing  surface  water  reliance  by  diversifying  sources  to \nimprove water security, NRW reduction, and increased efficiency in O&M.    \n \n9. \nAlignment with country strategy. The project is aligned with the National Development \nStrategy 2030, which highlights improving the quality of life in urban areas through rehabilitation \nof WSS systems and expansion of network, water supply reforms, and strengthening institutional \ndevelopment  toward  efficient,  transparent  management  and  financial  control  by  introducing \nmodern information technology.11 It also complies with the legal framework for the water sector \nbased  on  the  Water  Code  (2000,  amended  2012)  and  the  draft  Law  on  Drinking  Water  and \nSanitation. The draft law, expected to be approved by Parliament in 2018, foresees budgetary \nand user tariffs as financing sources and proposes privileges and benefits for providers of drinking \nwater  and  sanitation systems. The  law  provides guarantees  on the  safety  and quality  of  water \nsupply and the protection of water sources through the establishment of sanitary protection zones. \nThe project advances the ADB Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 and the concept of livable \ncities\u2014an  operational  priority  of \nthe  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  and \nStrategy 2030.12  \n   \n10. \n\nValue added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition:  \n\n(i) \n\nProject design and innovation. The ADB intervention initiated innovative design \nfeatures  such  as  (a)  pilot  testing  a  systematic  DMA  approach  for  NRW \nmanagement; (b) installing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for \nnew  network  management  practices,  including  active  leak  detection;  and \n\n                                                 \n9  World Bank. 2017.

ADB  is  introducing a  holistic  approach for  ensuring \nthe sustainability of the investments and operations through the business plan for \nDVK. The project will introduce international best practice through an incentive and \naccountability  mechanism,  with  a  performance  benchmarking  matrix.  To  ensure \nproject ownership  and the  retention  of  skilled  staff  after  the  project,  staff for  the \nproject implementation unit will be deployed by DVK and provided with an incentive \nstructure.   \nOperational efficiency and financial sustainability. ADB is enabling integration \nof  the  customer  database  with  the  billing,  collection,  accounting,  and  reporting \ncomputerized  systems.  The  provision  of  upgraded  software  and  training  will \nimprove the billing and collection efficiency of DVK and reduce NRW, as unbilled \nconsumption will decrease. \nBehavior  change  and  consumer  orientation. The  project  includes  a  behavior \nchange and communication plan, aimed at demand-side management, to promote \nthe  new  service  level  and  its  impact  on  health,  efficient  water  usage,  and \nawareness of the benefits of metering and billing among stakeholders. The project \nwill  strengthen  DVK  communications  and  the media  team\u2019s capacity  to  manage \ncustomer relations, improve service standards, establish communication protocol, \nand expand the customer response units to bolster customer trust. \nClimate change resilience. The  project  will  enhance  climate  change resilience \nthrough  flood  risk  management,  protection  of  groundwater  well  fields,  and \nimproved  drainage.  It  will  enable  an  overall  decrease  in  the  volume  of  water \nabstracted  from  groundwater  aquifers.  It  will  also  reduce  energy  demand, \ncontributing to climate mitigation and reducing the coping cost incurred by citizens.  \n \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n11. \nLessons learned. Based on experience from completed ADB-funded projects, lessons \nadopted for the project include (i) aligning the project preparation and implementation schedule \nwith the government\u2019s approval procedures, (ii) minimizing the number of procurement packages, \nand  (iii) using  advance  action  for  the  detailed  engineering  design  to  ensure  procurement \nreadiness. The project design incorporates these lessons with a limited number of procurement \npackages and adequate project implementation support. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: quality of life, health, urban resilience, \n12. \nand economic growth in Dushanbe improved and universal access to safe and affordable drinking \nwater by 2030. The project will have the following outcome: inclusive and sustainable access to \nsafe and resilient WSS services in Dushanbe city improved.13 \n \nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Climate-resilient water supply and sanitation infrastructure rehabilitated \nand  expanded. This  output  will  be  delivered  through  (i)  rehabilitating  17  wells,  22  pumps  and \nsecond  stage  pump  stations,  water  metering,  chlorination,  and  other  facilities  at  Kafernigan  I, \nincluding  the  installation  of  a  SCADA  system;  (ii)  reducing  NRW  through  the  rehabilitation  of \n17.2 km  of  transmission  main,  the  establishment  of  18  DMAs:  with  the  installation  of  42  bulk \nmeters and 5,220 smart meters, and the improvement of 57.5 km of distributional network in six \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fDMAs; (iii) increasing the storage capacity to 4,500 m3; and (iv) rehabilitating the south sewage \ncollector of 9.8 km.  \n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Sustainable  business  model  and  institutional  capacity  developed.  This \noutput will be delivered through prioritized institutional strengthening actions: (i) a business model \nfor  DVK  developed  that  covers  technical,  operational, \ninstitutional,  and  organizational \nrestructuring; and human resources management; (ii) an accountability and incentive mechanism \nestablished,  with  a  performance  benchmarking  matrix;  (iii)  a  smart  management  system \nenhanced  for  operational  efficiency;  asset  management;  and  seamless  integration  of  the \ncustomer  database,  billing,  collection,  accounting,  and  reporting;  (iv)  an  NRW  management \nsystem operationalized, with the installation of SCADA for new network management practices \nfor the 18 DMAs equipped with flow meters and smart meters for household service connections, \nactive leak detection, and calibration of meters; (v) institutional, technical, and financial capacity \nimproved;  and  (vi)  customer  care  service  standards  developed  and  behavior  change \ncommunication on water conservation and smart metering conducted.   \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $45.8  million  (Table  1).

Some  100,000  people  will  benefit  from  the \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial  \n\nimproved  water  supply  and  350,000  people  will  benefit  from  the  sanitation  investment. \nShohmansur district was selected for establishing DMAs through the application of criteria such \nas population density, incidence of waterborne diseases, typology of housing, social equity, and \nclimate  resilience.  The  civil  works  packages  under  output  1  are  technically  feasible;  they  use \noptimum  design  solutions  and  technology  for  undertaking  the  civil  works  and  O&M,  including \nSCADA  and  smart  meters,  which  DVK  can  manage.  The  design  standards  reflect  the \nenvironmental  objectives,  meet  government  climate  resilience  criteria,  and  will  not  result  in \noverdesign.  Output  2  will  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  project  outputs  through \ninstitutional strengthening and establishing the DVK business model.  \n \nB. \n \nEconomic viability. An  economic analysis  was conducted in accordance with relevant \n21. \nADB  guidelines for WSS  projects.15 Project  benefits  were  estimated from (i)  incremental  water \nconsumption  calculated  using  the  willingness  to  pay  of  the  targeted  residential  and  business \nconsumers; (ii) the cost savings from non-incremental water consumption with the switch to piped \nwater from alternative water sources; and (iii) public health benefits from the potential reduction \nin the incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting base-case economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  12.6%,  which  exceeds  the  ADB  minimum  discount  rate  of  9.0%  and \nconfirms the economic viability of the project. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project will \nremain economically robust under the following scenarios: (i) a 10% increase in investment cost; \n(ii)  a  10%  increase  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs;  (iii)  a  10%  decline  in  benefits; (iv)  a \ncombination of scenarios (i), (ii), and (iii); and (v) a delay in subproject benefits by 1 year.  \n \n A  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  by  estimating  cash  flows  over  the  project  life  to \n22. \nensure  the  project  will  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  the  full  O&M  cost.16 The  analysis \nconcluded that DVK has insufficient financial capacity for capital investments for improved water \nand sanitation infrastructure. DVK\u2019s financial position has deteriorated by more than 60% from \n2008 to 2018 because of the devaluation of the local currency. Its foreign currency denominated \ndebts from previous loans have become a significant burden for DVK as well as a source of further \ncurrency risk. The Ministry of Finance will transfer the project grant funds to DVK\u2019s balance sheet \nas  equity.  Increased  billing  and  tariff  collection  efficiency  has  been  identified  as  a  priority  for \ngenerating  the  required  revenues  to  improve  DVK\u2019s  financial  position.  To  achieve  financial \nsustainability, DVK needs to (i) increase tariffs by 16.2% per year for the next 3 years and at the \nrate  of  inflation thereafter;  and  (ii)  reduce  NRW from the  64%  in  2017  to  48%  by  2025 for the \nentire city, through a reduction in unbilled authorized consumption and other losses. The expected \ntariff growth based on the ongoing tariff study by the World Bank is within the limits found by the \nDushanbe residents willingness-to-pay study. A cash-flow model confirms that, with the proposed  \ntariff adjustments (reviewed annually) and improved operational efficiency, DVK would have the \nfinancial capacity to meet full O&M costs to sustain infrastructure and service delivery.17 Grant \ncovenants to ensure financial sustainability have been agreed with the government.   \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial management. The financial management risk is substantial because of DVK\u2019s \n23. \nexisting financing structure with (i) foreign exchange risk from repaying USD denominated loans; \n                                                 \n15 Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2);  ADB.  2017.

While  DVK  has  an  adequate  financial management \nsystem  and  policies  in  place,  it  will  require  some  adjustments  to  incorporate  project-specific \naccounting,  budgeting, auditing,  and  reporting.  ADB  rating  is  consistent  with  the  World  Bank \nrating. 18 The  auditors  of  DVK  identified  DVK\u2019s  ability  to  service  its  debt  as  a  concern,  The \nsubstantial financial management risk will be mitigated through a financial management action \nplan  that  includes  (i)  transferring  the  project  grant  funds  to  DVK\u2019s  balance  sheet  as  equity  to \nachieve positive equity in the first year of grant effectiveness and a sustainable debt\u2013equity ratio \nof  0.55  by  2024;19 (ii)  establishing  target  debt  service  coverage  and  debtors\u2019  days  ratios  as \nfinancial  covenants  for  DVK; 20  (iii) providing  training  and  consultant  support  to  DVK;  and                \n(iv) providing upgraded software to enable seamless integration of its accounting system with the \ncustomer  database  and  to  increase  revenues  by  reducing  unbilled  consumption,  which  is  a \nsignificant part of the high NRW. DVK has been implementing World Bank-funded projects, which \nuse grant disbursement procedures similar to ADB procedures.  \n \n24. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  capacity  risk  is  substantial  because  of  IA\u2019s  limited \ncapacity to manage procurement functions efficiently. There is significant procurement lead time \nand  implementation  delays.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  and  management  plan  has  been \nprepared.  All  the  procurement  (including  consulting  services  and  advance  actions)  will  be \nundertaken in full conformity with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement should be in accordance with the procurement plan, which covers all procurement \nactivity for the project, including threshold and review procedures, goods, works, and consulting \nservice contract packages, as indicated in the PAM (footnote 14).  \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  the  State  Executive  Authority  of  Dushanbe  City,  and  DVK.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n26. \nThe overall project social impacts are expected to be positive and will contribute to better \nliving  conditions,  overall  welfare,  and  health  of  the  target  beneficiaries.  The  south  sewage \ncollector  covers  5,700  hectares  catchment,  benefitting  about  352,000  people.  The  project  will \ndirectly benefit 100,000 residents in Shohmanshur and Rudaki districts by improving access to \nsafe water supply, and 38,000 of these residents in six DMAs will have 24/7 water supply. The \nproject will create temporary employment opportunities during implementation for local people, \nespecially the poor and vulnerable groups. It will benefit women, as it will reduce the time they \nspend  fetching,  storing,  and  treating  water;  and  managing  the  consequences  of  poor  quality \nwater, such as illness in the family. ADB will allocate resources for professional trainings and the \nrecruitment  of  social  and  gender  specialists  to  ensure  that  poverty,  gender,  and  other  social \nissues receive priority; and that women, the poor, and socially excluded groups are engaged in \nall  project  stages.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  has  been  prepared,  with \nmeasures to address the social impacts and enhance the distribution of project benefits.21  \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                 \n18  World  Bank.  2018.

The gender analysis indicated that women in the project areas are generally more \ndisadvantaged  than men. The  project  has  ensured  that  women  participate  and  benefit  equally \nfrom  the  interventions  through  (i)  participating  in  decision  making;  (ii)  increased  economic \nempowerment; (iii) enhancing their participation in technical training and access to information; \n(iv)  improved  gender  mainstreaming  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in \nproject  management;  and  (v)  including  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  project  performance \nmanagement system, monitoring and evaluation indicators, and regular project reporting. \n \nE. \n \n28. \ncategories are as follows.22   \n \n29. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  associated \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared for the project, in accordance with \nthe ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009).23 The IEE established that the project is not \nanticipated to cause significant irreversible adverse environment impacts but is expected to have \nshort-term  localized  construction-related  potential  impacts,  including  noise,  dust,  and  exhaust \nemissions from  equipment  and  construction  vehicles;  waste  management;  occupational  health \nand  safety;  community  health  and  safety;  and  construction  traffic.  During  operations,  potential \nimpacts are related to the limited local capacity to maintain the functionality of the components, \nwith  positive  impacts  expected  from  the  rehabilitation  works.  The  EMP  provides  appropriate \nmitigation measures to be incorporated in each contract. The implementing agency will ensure \nthe project complies with the environmental covenants. The implementing agency will recruit a \nfull-time environmental specialist in the PIG, to monitor the implementation of the EMP and site-\nspecific management plans. On-the-job training for institutional strengthening and environmental \nsafeguards compliance will be conducted by the project management, design  and supervision \nconsultants.  \n   \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  census  carried  out  during  project \npreparation  identified  about  44  affected  households  with  288  household  members.  Out  of  the \n44 affected households, 17 households with 98 members will experience a severe impact on their \nlivelihood, and no household was found to belong to vulnerable groups. The project will affect two \nbusinesses and 12 business renters. No relocation is expected as a result of this project. A land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARP) has been prepared to mitigate the associated impacts \nand losses, with an entitlement matrix. In addition, a land acquisition and resettlement framework \nhas  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  SPS  and  relevant  national  legislation  to  guide  the \nimplementing  agency  in  preparing  and  updating  LARPs  in  case  unanticipated  impacts  are \nidentified during detailed design and project implementation.  \n \n31. \nthe project area. \n \n32. \nStakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  through  formal  and  informal  focus  group \ndiscussions,  wide  consultations  with  communities,  targeted  workshop  consultations,  individual \nconsultations with displaced persons during the census, and a detailed measurement survey from \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).
