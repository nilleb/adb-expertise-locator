THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (Phase 2). The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (Phase 2), and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project will support the development of tourism in three aimags (provinces) of western \nMongolia\u2015an area of national priority for economic development\u2015focused on inclusive benefits \nfor communities, nature-based solutions to protect wilderness and heritage values, and post-\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) recovery and resilience.1 The project will build the capacity of \nresidents and a small but growing private sector for community-based tourism, create jobs \nthrough  the  establishment  of  tourist  streets  and  visitor  complexes,  and  strengthen  the \nmanagement of five globally important protected areas and heritage sites through improved visitor \nand sanitation facilities. The designs are based on post-COVID-19 tourism recovery projections, \nsanitation measures aligned with health and border procedures, and building standards for green \nand climate-resilient infrastructure. About 16,296 residents are expected to benefit from the \nproject through tourism-related skills and income. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, tourism was the largest and fastest-growing sector of \nthe global economy. Ecotourism, a major subsector, has comprised up to 20% of global tourism \nand is a key contributor to rural incomes and the financing of protected areas in many countries.2 \nMongolia has a small but emerging tourism sector. In 2019, tourism accounted for 7.2% of \nMongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), generating $989.2 million, 7.6% of total employment, \nand 88,500 jobs. International visitor arrivals in 2019 (577,300) increased by 6.4% compared with \n2018, and the tourism sector\u2019s annual GDP growth (11.9%) significantly exceeded national GDP \ngrowth (5.6%).3 By 2030, tourism was forecast to comprise 11% ($1.5 billion) of GDP, provide \n95,000 jobs, and attract 1 million international arrivals annually. The global spread of COVID-19 in \n2020 resulted in national border closures in Mongolia, the decline\u2013to almost zero\u2013of international \narrivals, and estimated losses in tourism revenue of more than $421 million.4 Long-term projections \nof the impact of COVID-19 on Mongolia\u2019s tourism sector are not yet available, but recovery \nscenarios for Asia and the Pacific suggest that a return to pre-COVID-19 international visitor \nnumbers will only occur by about 2023 (footnote 4). \n \n4.  Developing Mongolia\u2019s tourism sector is a high national priority to diversify the economy and \ncreate jobs. As short-term emergency efforts to address the immediate impacts of COVID-19 are \ncompleted, there is a need for longer-term projects which contribute to economic revitalization \ncombined with strengthening resilience to the risk of future disease outbreaks. Mongolia ranks \nmoderately in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (in 2019, Mongolia was ranked 93rd \n \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance to design the project. ADB. 2021. Technical \nAssistance to Mongolia for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (Phase 2). Manila. \n2  Ecotourism is defined as \u201cresponsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being \nof local people, and involves interpretation and education.\u201d The International Ecotourism Society. 2015. \n3 World Travel and Tourism Council. 2020. Travel and Tourism Economic Impact 2020 Mongolia. London. \n4 United Nations World Tourism Organization. 2021. UNWTO Tourism Data Dashboard. \n \n ", "2 \nout of 140 economies evaluated).5 Existing challenges include low service standards, inadequate \ninfrastructure, and a short tourism season due to harsh winters. Government plans to develop \ntourism focus on nature- and heritage-based tourism in protected areas, yet most of these sites are \nunderfunded and located in remote regions of high poverty. Tourism, if inadequately managed, \nmay result in negative ecological and cultural impacts, and provide few local benefits. Domestic \ntourism, although largely undocumented, is increasing rapidly in Mongolia and will also be an \nimportant  component  of  post-COVID-19  economic  recovery.6 To  address  these  issues,  the \ngovernment is implementing the National Program on Tourism Development, 2016\u20132025, which \naims to establish Mongolia as a global destination for nomadic culture.7 The program outlines a \nphased  approach  that  prioritizes  investments  in  visitor  facilities,  transport  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure,  and  community-based  products  and  services.  Following  projects  initiated  in \nnorthern and central Mongolia, including support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (para. \n10), western Mongolia is prioritized by the government for tourism development. \n \n5.  Western Mongolia comprises the three aimags of Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs, and \nborders the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. Much of the area is \ncharacterized by extreme remoteness and limited economic development. It also supports a \nunique cultural heritage\u2015the richest and most well-preserved rock art (ancient images on rock) \nin northern Asia, the highest number of ethnic groups in Mongolia, and a network of protected \nareas which includes two World Heritage sites and four Wetlands of International Importance. \nEach aimag supports small but operational domestic airports, new roads linking with the national \ncapital  (Ulaanbaatar),  and  international  border  crossings.  Poverty  rates  are  high  and  rural \npopulations depend largely on subsistence agriculture. Visitor numbers are small, but prior to \nCOVID-19 were increasing rapidly.8 Growing attractions include five locations with road access \nfrom the aimag centers and border crossings: Altai Tavan Bogd National Park (Bayan-Ulgii), Khar \nUs Nuur National Park (KUNNP) and Tsenkher Cave (TSC) (Khovd), and Khan Khukhii National \nPark (KKNP) and Uvs Nuur Basin Strictly Protected Area (UVSPA) (Uvs). These sites encompass \nover 2.1 million hectares (ha) of wilderness, biodiversity, and rock art.9 The early stage of tourism \ndevelopment in western Mongolia provides a timely opportunity to support sector planning, \nlivelihoods, and conservation. To achieve this will require a focus on four key areas, as follows. \n \n6.  Limited  inclusive  planning  and  community  benefits.  Few  residents  in  western \nMongolia are currently able to derive income from tourism.10 This is due to several linked factors. \nAt the institutional level, a regional planning approach is required to promote priority destinations; \n \n5  World Economic Forum. 2019.

Youth (15\u201334 years old) comprised 32.9% (91,831) of the \npopulation versus a national mean of 30.0%, and households headed by women comprised 10.4% (29,029) versus \na national mean of 7.7%. The poverty rate was 24.3% (Bayan-Ulgii), 40.1% (Khovd), and 29.6% (Uvs) versus a \nnational mean of 28.4%. GDP per capita was $1,305 (Bayan-Ulgii), $1,579 (Khovd), and $1,688 (Uvs) versus a \nnational mean of $3,696. During 2015\u20132019, annual tourist numbers to western Mongolia increased from about \n44,725 to 141,360: 24,477 to 67,908 (Bayan-Ulgii), 12,668 to 42,538 (Khovd) and 7,580 to 30,914 (Uvs). Visitors \ncomprised domestic (81%) and international (19%) tourists, the latter largely from Kazakhstan, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and Russian Federation, via overland travel. National Statistical Office. 2021. www.1212.mn. Ulaanbaatar. \n9  Altai Tavan Bogd National Park (630,000 ha, designated in 1996) includes one World Heritage site, the Petroglyphic \nComplexes of the Mongolian Altai (11,300 ha, 2011). The KUNNP (850,272 ha, 1997) and UVSPA (424,298 ha, \n1993) are Wetlands of International Importance; the UVSPA is part of the Uvs Nuur Basin World Heritage Site \n(898,064 ha, 2003). The KKNP (221,598 ha, 2000) includes Khyargas Lake, a popular tourism destination. The TSC \nis an unprotected cave system with the oldest rock paintings in Mongolia. In 2019 (i.e., pre-COVID-19) these sites \nreceived about 36,339 visitors (about 25.7% of total visitor numbers to western Mongolia). They are located in 13 \nsoums, which in 2020 supported 113,106 residents (40.5% of the population of western Mongolia). \n10  Tourism-related income includes guiding services, handicraft sales, food supply chains, and tour camp employment. \n \n ", "3 \ndevelop travel routes that maximize benefits to communities; and define minimum standards for \naccommodation,  goods,  and  services.  Aimag  tourism  plans,  prepared  during  2015\u20132019, \nprioritize community-based tourism; support for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(MSMEs); and capacity building but lack specific actions to support these. Tour camps present a \npotential source of local jobs, yet the issuance of tour camp concessions is not based on \nsystematic procedures or social and environmental standards.11 Elsewhere in Mongolia, these \nissues have favored external operators (who have greater access to finance and external \nmarkets),  provided  few  benefits  to  local  communities,  and  caused  environmental  damage. \nCommunities also have inadequate access to credit and training to produce quality goods (e.g., \nhandicrafts) or services (e.g., food supplies, guiding). These limitations are greater for women, \nwho have fewer job and leadership opportunities despite higher educational standards, and have \nworsened because of COVID-19, which has disproportionately impacted rural communities.12 \n \n7.  Insufficient enabling infrastructure. There are few public facilities in western Mongolia \nto catalyze tourism. The aimag centers of Khovd and Uvs are the gateways by land and air for \nmost visitors to the area, yet there are no visitor centers or other facilities to provide information, \npromote local goods and services, or highlight the region\u2019s tourism values. Protected areas close \nto  urban  and  rural  centers  (para.  5)  support  rising  visitor  numbers,  yet  public  access  is \nuncontrolled and there are few barrier gates, signs, or car parks. This is contributing to seasonal \ncongestion and damage to sensitive habitats and is impacting the visitor experience. \n \n8.  Inadequate sanitation and waste management. There are no organized systems for \nsolid-waste collection and sewage treatment for protected areas, and tour camp sanitation \nstandards are low. Public toilets are mostly unlined pits, and sewage seeps into the soil and \nwaterbodies. The KKNP, KUNNP, and UVSPA support unique lake systems within closed river \nbasins, rendering them especially vulnerable to disturbance, and some lakes already exhibit \nseasonal eutrophication (algal blooms) due to nutrient inputs from unmanaged sewage and other \nland use. Poor sanitation poses health risks and is also a key factor in low visitor satisfaction. \nTourists can be high-risk vectors for disease spread, especially to remote communities, and there \nis a need to establish health and sanitation standards for key tourism sites. Improved sanitation \nis a critical component for post-COVID-19 tourism recovery and strengthening the resilience of \nrural areas to the risk of future disease outbreaks.13 Solutions to address these issues need to \ninclude small, decentralized sanitation systems at tourism sites, tailored to local conditions and \nvisitor numbers, and health and safety measures established at tour camps and public campsites. \n \n9.  Inadequate management of cultural heritage sites and protected areas. The rock art \nof western Mongolia is a unique resource that, if managed sustainably, can provide jobs through \nguiding and the preservation of cultural heritage. Yet most sites are unmanaged and subject to \nincreasing damage. The TSC is a key stop on visitor itineraries yet is unprotected, and some cave \npaintings have been damaged by vandalism or theft.14 There is also no centralized facility in \nMongolia to document and promote rock art. For protected areas, visitors are an important source \nof potential revenue, yet most sites lack ticket collection stations, campsites are poorly managed, \n \n11 Western Mongolia has a small and undeveloped private sector, focused mainly on agriculture. In 2020, (i) 4,803 \nregistered MSMEs were located in western Mongolia (5.5% of the national total), yet only 184 (7.8%) were involved \nin accommodation and/or food services; (ii) only 1.1%\u20132.4% of employed residents (1,486 women and 101 men) \nworked in accommodation and food services; and (iii) 45 tour camps (Bayan-Ulgii\u201315, Khovd\u201311, Uvs\u201319) with a \ntotal of 117 employees) were operating, compared with some locations elsewhere in Mongolia which support more \nthan 80 tour camps in a single park. National Statistical Office. 2021. www.1212.mn. Ulaanbaatar. \n12 In 2020 over 58% of rural households in Mongolia were unable to generate income due to lockdowns followed by \nrising food prices.

Government \nmanagement plans exist for most sites, yet they focus on biodiversity conservation and lack \nguidelines or targets for livelihoods, tourism, and sanitation. Site management also requires the \nassessment of natural hazards and climate change since western Mongolia is experiencing rising \ntemperatures and increasing frequency and severity of storms and drought, which may threaten \nvisitor safety and the integrity of tourism infrastructure. \n \n10.  Government and donor efforts are addressing some of these issues. Cross-border tourism \nagreements have been established to facilitate regional travel, and in 2019 under a national skills \nprogram, about 970 residents in western Mongolia received free tourism training to improve \nexisting tourism services. Support for protected area management is being provided, especially \nby two civil society organizations (CSOs), The Nature Conservancy and World Wide Fund for \nNature,  and two  development  agencies,  GIZ  and  KfW.  For  rock  art, a  digital  inventory  of \narchaeological values in Bayan-Ulgii aimag has been developed,15 and a management plan for \nthe TSC has been prepared. Support by ADB for western Mongolia that has benefited tourism \nincludes the upgrade of roads, border crossings, health facilities, urban infrastructure, agriculture \nvalue chains, and private sector development.16 At the national level, tourism feasibility studies, \ntraining in service standards, and small grant support have been provided by the United Nations, \nCSOs, and development agencies. During 2015\u20132019, ADB\u2015with JFPR funding support\u2015led \nthe development of the first grant and lending projects for tourism in two national parks in northern \nMongolia. These projects, termed phase 1, resulted in new models for community-based tourism \nand a basis to scale up ADB support for tourism to other priority regions in Mongolia.17 \n \n11.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Mongolia\u2019s  National  Program  on  Tourism \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132025 (footnote 7) which prioritizes the development of western Mongolia. It \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  draft  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2021\u20132024  for  green \ndevelopment; is listed in the country operations business plan, 2021; and supports ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 seven operational priorities for addressing poverty, gender equality, climate resilience and \nenvironmental  sustainability,  livable  cities,  rural  development,  governance,  and  regional \ncooperation and integration.18 The project has been designed in parallel with preparation of the \nADB-supported Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tourism Strategy 2030, \nand its associated regional tourism investment framework, 2020\u20132025. Western Mongolia is part \nof the Altai priority cluster group, one of seven regions identified in the strategy for tourism support. \nThe project is among the first tourism projects to be developed since approval of the strategy and \nresponds to the need for improved visitor sanitation facilities in the Altai priority cluster group.19 \n \n12.  Lessons. The project incorporates lessons from ADB support under phase 1 (footnote \n17) and projects by other agencies. These experiences highlight the need for a multisector \napproach that addresses the linked issues of tourism, livelihoods, waste, and conservation \n \n15 University of Oregon. 2009.

Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable tourism development in \nMongolia improved and diversified (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: \nsustainability and inclusiveness of tourism in western Mongolia increased.20 \n \n14.  Output 1: Inclusive planning and capacity for community-based tourism enhanced. \nThis output will strengthen the institutional framework for tourism and increase the number of local \nbeneficiaries from tourism. The project will (i) prepare the first tourism master plan for western \nMongolia, which will define limits for tourism development based on stakeholder consensus and \ngrowth projections, travel routes which maximize benefits for communities, and actions to support \npost-COVID-19 sector recovery; (ii) strengthen the three aimag tourism plans to establish targets \nfor livelihoods, conservation, and sanitation aligned with parallel ADB projects on health and \nborder procedures; (iii) establish the first tour camp concession manual and certification program \nfor western Mongolia to embed social and gender targets and environmental standards  in \ncommercial operations, strengthen links with local goods and services, and provide a stable \nbusiness framework for about 45 tour camps with 117 employees; (iv) construct two tourist streets \nin the Khovd and Uvs aimag centers and nine women-led markets, to showcase and sell local \nproducts; and (v) implement a pilot tourism development program for communities and MSMEs, \ncomprising vocational training, a community revolving fund (CRF), youth incubator, and the \nestablishment of about 13 community-based organizations (CBOs).21 About 8,162 residents (50% \nwomen and 30% youth) will benefit from tourism-related businesses and value chains. \n \n15.  Output 2: Enabling infrastructure constructed. This output will (i) construct the first \ntourism center in western Mongolia\u2014the Uvs tourism complex (UVTC) in Uvs aimag; (ii) establish \nsupporting infrastructure for the UVTC, including car parking and extension of the aimag power \nline to the site; (iii) establish traffic management plans, safety signs, and barrier gates, and \nupgrade 12 small car parks for a total capacity of 240 vehicles at five protected areas and cultural \nheritage sites to control public access and halt off-road vehicle damage; and (iv) develop \ninstitutional arrangements for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project facilities. The \nUVTC will help catalyze tourism development for western Mongolia and will have an operational \nmandate focused on education, heritage, and nature. It will prioritize local employment and \ncommunity goods and services and work closely with the community beneficiaries and MSMEs \nunder output 1 for tourism planning. The designs apply a best practice green standard for water \nand energy efficiency, low-carbon emissions, and the use of cost-effective local materials.22 \n \n16.  Output 3: Sanitation and waste management improved. This output will (i) facilitate the \ninstallation of about 60 low-cost and gender-sensitive toilet systems at tour camps, campsites, and \n \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 The program will focus initially on rural communities in five protected areas and cultural heritage sites (para. 5) and \nbe developed in partnership with aimag youth centers, universities, and tour operators. The revolving fund will apply \na design piloted with previous JFPR support and will be the first such fund for community-based tourism in western \nMongolia. The youth incubator will comprise (i) training venues in two tourism complexes (outputs 2 and 4) as safe \nlearning spaces to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, and (ii) training and links with local enterprises to develop \ntourism goods and services. The CBOs will help implement the program and coordinate community participation. \n22 The UVTC will comprise a 2-storey complex with a capacity for 1,000 people per day to meet visitor projections \n(Para. 28). The infrastructure designs apply the Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies standard. \n \n ", "6 \nproject-funded car parks at five protected areas and cultural heritage sites. The project will replicate \nsuccessful JFPR-funded toilet designs and O&M procedures from phase 1, including CBO-led \nmanagement of the campsites and toilets, and sustainable financing from campsite fees; (ii) \nestablish waste disposal procedures for the project facilities, including safe transport and treatment \nat rural and urban wastewater treatment plants and landfills to be upgraded under ADB\u2019s Aimags \nand Soums Green Regional Investment Development Program (ASDIP) (footnote 16); and (iii) \nimplement a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program. This will establish sanitation, health, \nand safety standards and procedures for the project communities and facilities as well as for tour \ncamps. The WASH program will be planned with aimag health and border agencies and will be \nintegrated in the aimag tourism plans (output 1) and aligned with guidelines of the World Health \nOrganization for infection prevention and control.23 These measures will strengthen post-COVID-\n19 resilience for over 16,296 residents and 36,000 visitors per year to these protected areas. \n \n17.  Output 4: Management of cultural heritage sites and protected areas strengthened. \nThis output will (i) construct the first rock art and nomadic culture center in Mongolia, including a \ndigital museum, and will be in Khovd aimag. It will include high-quality two- and three-dimensional \nvirtual displays of the rock art of the TSC and other sites, establish a digital inventory for rock art, \nand develop an online platform to promote digital tourism for cultural heritage.24 The center, \nmuseum, and access to the TSC will be managed under an integrated approach including O&M, \nentry fees, and guided visits to and protection of the TSC; (ii) establish at least 35 small \nmanagement facilities at five protected areas and cultural heritage sites, comprising public \ncampsites, information centers, public cooking cabins, bird watching towers, ranger stations, and \nfee collection stations to protect habitats and improve facilities in locations subject to high visitor \nuse; (iii) strengthen site management plans to integrate O&M procedures for the project facilities; \nand (iv) train about 120 residents and 12 local agencies to implement the revised site plans. The \nproject facilities will be operated and maintained by about 13 CBOs in coordination with the park \nadministrations, generating about 176 jobs (40% of these for women). Overall, these measures \nwill help strengthen the management of five globally important protected areas. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n18.  Key  features  and  innovation.  ADB  has  become  a  lead  development  partner  for \nMongolia\u2019s emerging tourism sector. The project is the first tourism project to be developed since \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and only the second loan-funded tourism project for Mongolia, with both \nfunded by ADB. The multisector approach developed under phase 1 has been applied and scaled \nup to include three aimags, rock art heritage, and a focus on post-COVID-19 recovery and \nresilience. Project features include (i) replication of selected components from phase 1, benefiting \nfrom tested methods and lessons learned;25 (ii) initiatives led by women and youth; (iii) private \nsector participation; (iv) application of a green building standard for energy and water efficiency; \n(v) use of high-level technology to establish a digital museum; and (vi) synergy with other projects \nby ADB, CSOs, and development partners.26 The designs support the strategic pillars of the \n \n23 World Health Organization. 2020. Infection prevention and control guidance (COVID-19). \n24 To supplement the loan financing and scale up the design and benefits of the digital museum, additional funding of \n$0.65 million is being sought from the High-Level Technology Fund (financing partner: the Government of Japan). \n25 The components on revolving funds, CBOs, and toilet designs (outputs 1 and 3) are applied from phase 1. Lessons \nfrom phase 1 are described in M. R. Bezuijen. 2019. Blue skies and green steppe \u2013 developing sustainable tourism \nin Mongolia. ADB Blog; and ADB. 2020.

ATTACHED GRANT ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The grant will focus on improving livelihoods for rural communities in 13 soums (districts) \nat the five project protected areas and heritage sites (para. 5), which are characterized by high \nrates of poverty. The grant will have three components, which are linked with the project: (i) \ninclusive planning and capacity for community-based tourism enhanced, (ii) sanitation and waste \nmanagement improved, and (iii) management of cultural heritage sites and protected areas \nstrengthened. Component 1 will support the establishment of the first pilot tourism development \nprogram for Mongolia (para. 14) to provide training, low-interest finance, and market venues for \nabout 2,449 poor and vulnerable residents. Component 2 will support the installation of about 60 \npublic toilets at visitor sites and the first WASH program for the tourism sector in western Mongolia \n(para. 16). Component 3 will support the establishment of at least 35 small public facilities at the \nprotected areas and heritage sites (para. 17), generating about 176 jobs (30% for the poor). \n \n26.  The grant and loan have been designed for synergy. Beneficiaries of the pilot tourism \ndevelopment program will be prioritized for vendor spaces at the loan-funded tourist streets and \ncomplexes to promote and sell community goods and services developed with the grant funding. \nFor the TSC, a grant-funded information center and training of local guides will be linked with \nO&M of the loan-funded rock art and nomadic cultural center to support the first community-led \napproach in Mongolia for jobs, livelihoods, and preservation of rock art heritage. The grant \ndesigns apply measures piloted under a previous JFPR-funded project in Mongolia (footnote 17) \nand match these with new features. Overall, the grant will benefit about 8,162 residents of the \ntotal project beneficiaries (para. 2), linked with the improved management of globally important \nprotected areas and heritage sites. \n \n27.  The grant will be administered by ADB and implemented through the project with the \nMinistry of Environment and Tourism (MET) as the executing agency and the MET\u2019s Department \nof Protected Areas Management as the implementing agency. A project implementation unit (PIU) \nwill be established for the project and funded under the loan to reduce grant administration costs. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of project coordination, counterpart \nstaff, office facilities, and financing of taxes and duties for the grant (footnote 28). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The project is technically feasible. The scope and design capacity of the project facilities \nwas developed based on market analysis of pre-COVID-19 visitor numbers, and visitor projections \nfor the project sites based on post-COVID-19 recovery scenarios issued by the United Nations \nWorld  Tourism  Organization.  Engineering  solutions  were  designed  considering  costs  of \nconstruction and O&M; durability; climate; and impacts on aesthetic, cultural, and wilderness \nvalues. Climate resilience and mitigation measures for the tourist streets and complexes include \nusing solar panels, recycling treated wastewater for toilet flushing and greening, and orienting \nbuildings for passive solar heating and cooling. Designs for the two tourist complexes include on-\nsite wastewater treatment plants with proven, low-cost technology suitable for cold climates and \ntested elsewhere in Mongolia. For the protected areas, the toilet designs apply decentralized, \nnon-flushing dry units developed under phase 1 to avoid wastewater generation. The designs \ncomply with a green building standard for water and energy efficiency (footnote 22). \n \n \n \n ", "10 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 18.3% and an economic net present value of MNT81.8 million. \nThree major benefits were evaluated: the willingness-to-pay of domestic and international tourists \nto visit the project facilities (i.e., use value) and of domestic tourists to support efforts to protect \nnatural  and  cultural  assets  (i.e.,  non-use  value),  and  the  income  generated  by  increased \ninternational tourism at project sites. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the project is robust to \nnegative scenarios, including increases in investment and/or O&M costs, and reduced benefits. \nThe economic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as some effects such \nas ecological benefits are not easily quantifiable. The project will also contribute to regional \neconomic benefits through the provision of new tourism goods and services in the CAREC region. \nThe financial analysis concluded that the overall project is financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The sustainability of the outcome and outputs will be maintained over the economic life of \nthe project by the establishment of O&M arrangements and cost recovery from visitor entry fees \nand revenue from sales to visitors. The government will be responsible for O&M of the tourist \nstreets and complexes. The CBOs will be responsible for the small public facilities in the project \nprotected areas and heritage sites. Procedures for O&M and financing of the project facilities will \nbe integrated within the project-funded regional tourism master plan, aimag tourism plans, and \nsite management plans. Mitigation measures relating to the project\u2019s institutional, environmental, \nsocial, economic, and financial risks have been incorporated into the project designs to minimize \nadverse impacts on cultural heritage and natural values. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  The legal and regulatory frameworks required for a well-functioning public sector are by \nand large in place in Mongolia, but that there are gaps in applied practices and in the enforcement \nof rules. Corruption is perceived to be endemic and increasing, and the anticorruption institutional \nsystem lacks independence and is subject to political pressure.31 The assessed premitigation \nfinancial management risk for the project is moderate, mainly due to a lack of qualified financial \nmanagement staff within the implementing agencies. Measures to mitigate these risks include the \nappointment of a qualified accountant within the PIU and training on ADB disbursement. The \nassessed premitigation procurement risk is medium, mainly due to a lack of qualified personnel \nwithin the implementing agencies to conduct procurement. This risk will be mitigated by recruiting \na qualified procurement specialist for the PIU. Open competitive bidding is specified for most of \nthe project goods and works to ensure that qualified firms are recruited. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and \nMET. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Poverty and social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty reduction. A \npoverty and social analysis was undertaken and a social development action plan was prepared, \nbased on stakeholder consultations and social surveys during project preparation. The project will \ncontribute to poverty reduction and inclusive development in Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, and Uvs aimags. \nAbout 16,296 residents are expected to benefit from the project through access to new and \n \n31 ADB. 2020.

The project will create about 1,349 jobs, \ncomprising about 1,125 jobs during construction and 224 jobs for O&M of the project facilities. \nThe project training, low-interest finance, and women-led markets will strengthen local businesses \nand tourism value chains. The social development action plan includes targets for the poor and \nyouth. The project design incorporates universal access including wheelchair ramps for the tourist \nstreets, complexes, and toilets. A project consultation and participation plan and stakeholder \ncommunication strategy have been prepared and are described in the PAM. These are based on \nstakeholder consultations, conducted with guidance from ADB\u2019s NGO and Civil Society Center, \nand require continued public consultation and participation during implementation. \n \n33.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  following  ADB \nguidelines, and a gender action plan has been prepared.32 Gender targets include (i) the CBOs \nand CRF committees comprise at least 40% women, (ii) 60% of recipients of the CRF loans and \nmarket stalls are women, (iii) women comprise 50% of participants in the capacity building \nactivities, (iv) nine women-led markets established, and (v) 40% of jobs are provided to women. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nThe project is designed to achieve environmental benefits, including the improved management \nof  five  globally  important  protected  areas  and  protection  of  rock  art  heritage.  The  initial \nenvironmental examination is based on the project feasibility study and domestic environmental \nassessment, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. The project designs comply with ADB \nsafeguard requirements for works in protected areas and Mongolia\u2019s Law on Special Protected \nAreas. MET, through the PIU, will be responsible for the implementation of and compliance with \nthe EMP. The PIU will include a qualified environment safeguard specialist, who will coordinate \nEMP implementation. Risks include short-term noise and dust disturbance during construction, \nthe proximity of some works to heritage sites, cumulative pressures on water resources and flora \nand fauna resulting from increased tourism development, and health and safety risks due to \nCOVID-19 and/or operation of equipment and facilities. Measures to address these risks include \nthe restriction of project works in protected areas to small facilities in the multiple-use zones, \ncompliance with the park management plans, delineation of heritage sites before works, and \nhealth and safety requirements. A project grievance redress mechanism has been prepared. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project is not expected to involve involuntary \nland acquisition, economic or physical displacement, or involuntary restrictions on land use or on \naccess to protected areas. All civil works will be implemented within existing sites or on state-\nowned lands without involving acquisition of private or community lands or restriction on land use \nor access to protected areas which would lead to physical or economic displacement of people \nas defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. During the detailed design phase, the PIU \nwill update the project due diligence report developed during project preparation, and screen \nproject components to avoid involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n \n32 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB.
