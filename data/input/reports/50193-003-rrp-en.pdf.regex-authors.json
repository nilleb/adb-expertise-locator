THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan (RBL) to India for the Maharashtra Rural High Voltage Distribution System Expansion \nProgram. The report also describes the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) for \nImplementation Support for the Maharashtra Rural High Voltage Distribution System Expansion \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the transaction TA. \n \n2.  The RBL will support a component of the state of Maharashtra\u2019s program to provide \naccess to efficient, reliable, and good quality power supply to new agriculture customers through \na metered high voltage distribution system (HVDS), related institutional strengthening, and \nenhanced awareness on HVDS and the efficient use of electricity and water for agriculture. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The state economy. Maharashtra, the second most populous state in India, has a high \nannual per capita income compared with the national average.1 However, there is significant \ninequality within Maharashtra; the rural eastern parts of the state in particular have a high \nproportion of the population living below the poverty line.2 About half of the state\u2019s labor force \nremains engaged in agriculture and related activities, but agriculture\u2019s share of the state\u2019s gross \ndomestic product declined from 15.3% in FY2002 to 12.2% in FY2017 as a result of small farm \nsizes,  lack  of  irrigation  and  dependence  on  rainfall,  low  agriculture  productivity  and                        \nless-than-efficient use of electricity and water, poor storage facilities and connectivity to markets. \nMaharashtra\u2019s Vision 2030 focuses on the agriculture sector with the goals of increasing growth \nto 5% per year, and increasing agricultural productivity and farmers\u2019 incomes.3 These would be \nachieved by reducing the cost of cultivation; increasing the area under irrigation; providing access \nto a reliable power supply; promoting distributed solar power, electricity, water conservation and \nagriculture value chains; and improving access to markets. \n \n4.  Power sector. The Maharashtra Energy Department (MED)4  is responsible for the state\u2019s \npower  sector.  The  Maharashtra  State  Electricity  Board  was  unbundled  into  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution utilities in 2005; at that time aggregate technical and commercial \nlosses averaged about 35%, the power sector had a demand\u2013supply gap of over 20%, and \ncustomers, particularly in rural areas, faced unreliable and poor-quality supply. Steady progress \nhas been made to improve electricity access and electricity distribution efficiencies along with \ngeneration and transmission capacity. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company \nLimited  (MSEDCL),  a  state-owned  enterprise  with  a  distribution  license  formed  after  the \nunbundling, is currently India\u2019s largest electricity distribution company, supplying over 25.4 million \ncustomers in 457 towns and nearly 42,000 villages across Maharashtra, except in the city of \nMumbai.  MSEDCL  supplies  electricity  to  over  4.2  million  agricultural  customers  in  rural \nMaharashtra, who account for an estimated 30% of its electricity sales volume. However, despite \noverall efficiency improvements, a healthy sales mix (industrial and commercial sales account for \n \n1  The per capita income of Maharashtra was \u20b9165,491 compared with \u20b9103,870 nationally in FY2017.

", "2 \nabout 44% of total sales), and high tariffs,5 MSEDCL\u2019s financial status is impacted by its \nperformance in rural Maharashtra, and a large base of rural customers that are not efficiently or \nreliably supplied with electricity. \n \n5.  Rural power sector constraints. Deficiencies in the traditional electricity distribution \nnetwork design and historically inadequate capital expenditures have resulted in long, inefficient                \nlow-voltage distribution lines, with nearly 15\u201320 customers sharing a single large distribution \ntransformer. Most rural feeders were mixed, with rural domestic and agriculture customers on the \nsame feeder. MSEDCL\u2019s Gaothan and Infrastructure Plan program (implemented over 2006\u2013\n2015) strengthened the rural distribution network and physically segregated 5,000 rural feeders. \nThis allowed agriculture customers to receive 8\u201310 hours supply per day (though efficiency, \nquality and reliability are still concerns), while other customers receive a continuous supply. This \nhas contributed to reducing average utility wide aggregate technical and commercial losses to \nabout 17% in 2015. Per capita usage of electricity in Maharashtra reached about 1,300 kilowatt-\nhours (kWh)/year in 2014, but was under 800 kWh/year in rural areas, low compared to the world \naverage of 3,000 kWh/year. \n \n6.  Power supply to agriculture customers remains affected by low metering levels, while \ninadequate payment enforcement results in estimated losses exceeding 20% for rural feeders \nwith predominantly agricultural customers. Most agricultural customers are charged a fixed tariff \nbased on the declared capacity of the agriculture pump rather than on actual electricity usage, \nresulting in inefficient electricity and water consumption. Retail agricultural tariffs are linked to \nprior  assessments  of  customer  payment  capacity  and  require  government  subsidies  and           \ncross-subsidies from other customer categories to cover the cost of supply. The recurring \nelectricity subsidy in Maharashtra for agriculture customers was $0.8 billion in FY2018.6 This \nimpacts  the  state\u2019s  ability  to  fund  social  programs  while  cross-subsidies  reduce  the \ncompetitiveness of industries. Power is also often supplied to agricultural customers at night \nimpacting pump usage and the quality of rural life.  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n7.  Government strategy and program for the sector. The electricity sector in India is \nfocused on accelerated electrification, adoption of clean energy source and increased energy \nefficiency, improvement in the quality of power supply to customers, and improved performance \nof  utilities,  which  have  traditionally  been  loss  making.  In  2016,  the  state  government  of \nMaharashtra formulated its program of Power for All with the objective to provide continuous        \n(24-hour) reliable power to all non-agriculture customers and an assured 8\u201310 hours daily supply \nfor agricultural customers across the state. The program has components covering renewable \nenergy generation predominantly through the private sector, transmission and distribution system \nstrengthening, 100% household electrification, adoption of efficient street lighting and agriculture \npumps, metering and information and communication technology. While progress has been \nsignificant on renewable energy capacity addition, transmission and distribution investments and \nrural electrification for households, the agriculture pump related component has not materially \nprogressed. In 2018, the state government of Maharashtra reviewed the requirements for reliable \nrural power  supply for the agriculture sector and decided to provide applicants for agriculture \nelectricity connections either a connection through HVDS or off-grid solar water pumps to ensure \n \n5  Tariffs are set by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). Industrial tariffs in Maharashtra are \namong the highest in India (about \u20b98/kWh in FY2018). \n6  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2018. Agriculture Policies in India. Paris. Nationally, \nelectricity subsidy for farmers was nearly $9 billion in 2016, second to fertilizer subsidies. Electricity subsidies grew \nnearly fourfold over 2000\u20132016.  \n ", "3 \nthe  agriculture  sector  can  access  modern,  reliable  energy.  The  program  components  are \nperiodically reviewed by the utilities, government and the regulator, and updated to 2021 to meet \nincreasing demand. It is expected that the electrification program for farmers (including HVDS) \nwould continue beyond 2021 after government and regulatory approvals. \n \n8.  Proposed results-based lending program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) RBL \nwill support Maharashtra\u2019s HVDS program for new grid-connected rural agricultural customers \nacross the state. The HVDS program is demand-driven and based on applications received for \nnew agricultural connections. The RBL program is expected to be implemented from April 2020 \nto December 2021, by which time about 156,000 metered HVDS connections are expected to be \nin  place  with  distribution  transformers,  11  kilovolt  (kV)  grid  extensions,  and  upstream \nstrengthening for adequate network capacity. \n \n9.  The RBL modality is suitable for the following reasons: (i) it uses MSEDCL\u2019s strong \nimplementation capacity and functional enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to undertake \nthe HVDS program;7 (ii) government ownership of the program is strong, as demonstrated by \nimplementation of past rural electrification initiatives, and the initial implementation of the HVDS \nprogram in 2019; (iii) it will lower the transaction costs of implementing activities over the state of \nMaharashtra by using existing fiduciary and safeguard systems, which will be further enhanced \nunder the program action plan (PAP); and (iv) the state government of Maharashtra and MSEDCL \nare committed to strengthening sector governance including metering of agricultural customers, \nimproving operational performance, and facilitating information disclosure.8 \n \n10.  High voltage distribution system as an enabler. Increasing the efficiency and reliability \nof electricity supply to agricultural customers poses significant challenges (para. 6). Maharashtra \nhas undertaken pilots to increase the energy efficiency of pumps using the existing grid,9 and \npromoted the  adoption of  drip  irrigation.  The  pace  of  adoption  is slow  because of  limited \nawareness on energy efficiency, high upfront costs, frequent pump burnout due to low voltage \nsupply, and unmetered electricity supply. There is a need to review business models and \ntechnology, and to undertake work across the electricity, water, and agriculture sectors. The \nadoption of HVDS for rural feeders can support models for private sector development including \nfranchisees and energy service companies for inefficient pump replacements. Given the national \nimportance of rural development and the need to address distress on the part of farmers, the \ngovernment of India is working to increase electricity and water use efficiency, improve subsidy \ntargeting and farmers\u2019 incomes by 2022.10  HVDS and customer metering support improved \nsector governance and would be a platform to meet these goals.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The proposed intervention is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities to promote rural development and food security; tackle climate change, build \nclimate and disaster resilience, enhance environmental sustainability; accelerate progress in \n \n7  MSEDCL is one of the few public sector electricity utilities in India with functional ERP and advanced information \ntechnology capabilities and customer geo-referencing to support implementation monitoring. \n8  Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n19.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated to be a total of \n$703.1 million including eligible prior results from 2019 (Table 3 & para 21). This includes capital \nexpenditure  on  upstream  network  including  construction  and  augmentation  of  33/11  kV \nsubstations and downstream network strengthening including 11 kV distribution lines, poles, \ndistribution transformers, and metered connections. It includes costs related to institutional \ncapacity development, monitoring and improving customer awareness. \n ", "7 \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, 2020\u20132021 \n(in 2019 prices) \nAmount  Share of Total \nItema  ($ million)  (%) \nHVDS electricity distribution network in rural     \n  Maharashtra for new agriculture customers installed  548.1  77.9 \nInstitutional capacity of MSEDCL improved  2.0  0.3 \nAwareness on HVDS and the efficient use of electricity and    0.5  0.1 \nwater in rural Maharashtra enhanced   \nTaxes  88.0  12.5 \nAdministration cost  23.1  3.3 \nFinancing costs  20.9  3.0 \nContingencies  20.4  2.9 \n  Total  703.1  100.0 \n  HVDS = high voltage distribution system, MSEDCL = Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited. \n   a This includes financing of eligible prior results in 2019.   \n  Sources: Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and Government of Maharashtra estimates. \n \n20.  Program financing. The total financing needed is estimated at $703.1 million, of which \nthe government has requested a regular loan of $346.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-\nline method, the average maturity is 12.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB.

Disbursement arrangements. Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the national \ngovernment\u2019s Controller of Aid, Accounts and Audit Account. The loan will be disbursed subject \nto the achievement and verification of the DLIs. Financing of prior results not more than 12 months \nbefore loan signing is requested to support achieving the results as scheduled, given that such \nactivities comply with the PAP and the results verified in accordance with verification protocols. \nBased on assessments, prior results for achievement of DLIs 4, 5, and 6 are not expected to \nexceed 13% of ADB financing. An advance disbursement may be requested after loan approval \nto finance advance payments to contractors and would not exceed 20% of ADB financing. The \ncombined total of advance financing and financing for prior results would not exceed 30% of ADB \nfinancing. Subsequent disbursements will be made based on quarterly achievement of DLIs. \nPartial  disbursements for  DLIs  4,  5,  6,  and  7  are  allowed  in  proportion  to the  DLI target \nachievement provided these are verified and accepted by ADB. The verification mechanism and \nprotocols have been established depending on the nature of the DLIs (Appendix 3). \n \n ", "8 \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n22.  Various assessments were undertaken to assess capacity gaps for the program. An initial \nPAP was prepared and has been agreed with MSEDCL and MED to define specific activities to \nimprove program implementation. The PAP includes actions to strengthen technical capacity; \nmonitoring; fiduciary responsibilities, gender, and safeguards to ensure that the achievement of \nkey RBL program results strengthens MSEDCL and government systems. The PAP will be \nrefined, improved, and updated during implementation, as needed. \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n23.   The attached TA will help strengthen the RBL program implementation through a pilot for \nenergy and water conservation that would support demonstration and awareness raising on the \nbenefit of the HVDS platform, the potential for associated services including irrigation advisory, \npump replacement and wider adoption of drip irrigation. It would also support advocacy for design \ninputs for effective policy making including on tariff-setting, payment, and subsidy administration \nfor efficient electricity and water use, and to scale up the post-2021 HVDS program. The TA would \nalso provide support to improve monitoring and coordination with stakeholders and strengthen \ncapacity for safeguards. The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe  government  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.18 MED will be responsible for the TA and will coordinate through MSEDCL and \nrelevant agencies including Maharashtra Energy Development Agency, Groundwater Surveys \nand Development Agency, and the Water Resources Department. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  Maharashtra  Energy  Department  and  MSEDCL  are  the  executing  agencies  for  the \nprogram. MSEDCL will be responsible for physical investments in the network under the program. \nA steering group headed by the Energy Secretary and Chairman and Managing Director of \nMSEDCL will periodically review program implementation and provide overall direction. The \nHVDS unit in MSEDCL headed by a Chief Engineer will review implementation being undertaken \nthrough MSEDCL field offices, aggregate information at a circle level, and submit periodic \nprogress reports on achievements including on DLIs, the PAP as well as other key indicators. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n25.  Relevance, justification, and adequacy. The RBL program is relevant and is part of \nMaharashtra\u2019s broader government program to improve access, efficiency, and reliability for new \nagriculture customers. While HVDS is a proven solution for the distribution sector, it has not been \nwidely adopted for agricultural customers because of the high upfront capital expenditure. The \ntechnical modeling of representative agriculture feeders in rural Maharashtra confirmed the \nreduction in losses by adopting HVDS for new connections compared to the business as usual. \nThe benefits significantly increase if HVDS is extended to both new and existing connections. The \nHVDS program for new connections is expected to continue after 2021 . There is also a plan for \nprogressive conversion of existing customers for high loss feeders, and this will be reviewed under \nthe PAP. The RBL program includes capacity enhancement of 33/11 kV upstream substations \n \n18 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nbased on the expected increase in energy demand for HVDS, which will be undertaken in \ncoordination  with  the  transmission  utility.  MSEDCL  has  entered  into  power  purchase \narrangements under the state\u2019s solar program implemented through Energy Efficiency Services \nLimited (EESL) and the private sector including distributed grid connected rural solar projects, to \nprovide daytime power for the agricultural sector. 19 The plans to develop the HVDS network are \nbased on standard designs, are operationally viable, and would increase supply reliability and \npower quality. Climate financing is estimated to cost $89.4 million. ADB will finance $87.0 million \nfor mitigation and $2.4 million for adaptation. These costs were estimated using ADB\u2019s guidance \nnote on counting climate finance.  \n \n26.  Economic returns. Economic analysis, carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines,20 \nreviewed alternatives to the RBL program and estimated an economic internal rate of return of \n10.6% in constant 2019 prices compared with business-as-usual connections using low voltage \ndistribution systems. The adoption of HVDS would reduce distribution losses, improve reliability \nof supply, and reduce burnout rates for agriculture pumps and distribution transformers. It reduces \nthe use of diesel in case of outages. The estimated economic returns increase further if coupled \nwith the adoption of efficient pumps and drip irrigation and increased farmer productivity.  \n \n27.  Poverty reduction and gender. The RBL program aims to supply reliable power to \nagricultural customers (including women) for irrigation, thereby helping increase agricultural \nproductivity and incomes. Most farmers in Maharashtra are considered small and marginal.21 The \nprogram is classified as having some gender elements. MSEDCL has progressive policies on \nwomen\u2019s recruitment and their awareness on and participation in HVDS training would be \nstrengthened under the RBL program.  Participation of women in HVDS customer awareness \nraising will also be supported. The potential for farmers and their families, including women, to \nbenefit from reduced  electricity  and  water  usage,  and  improvements in  government  policy  \nincluding linkages to  other programs to be associated with HVDS would be studied under the \nproposed pilot supported by the TA, and the knowledge shared with MED and other stakeholders. \n \n28.  Sustainability  and  governance.  In  June  2019,  MSEDCL  was  ranked  third  among \ndistribution utilities nationally for performance under the government\u2019s Ujwal Discom Assurance \nYojana (a program for operational improvement and financial turnaround) and one of the few \npublic sector electricity distribution companies with an after-tax profit. However, MSEDCL had a \ndebt-service coverage ratio of less than 1 in FY2018. To reduce the impact on MSEDCL for the \ncapital-intensive HVDS program, the state government proposes to provide long tenor ADB funds \nas a grant to MSEDCL. Tariffs for MSEDCL are independently set by the Maharashtra Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission  (MERC)  based  on  a published  methodology and  a  public  hearing \nprocess. MSEDCL has been unable to effectively meter the agricultural customers on the \nconventional distribution network (para. 6). The introduction of HVDS supports 100% metering, \nmonitoring of energy consumption, and billing based on a usage-based tariff, and improves the \nutility\u2019s capacity to track and take action on non-paying customers. The attached TA would \nsupport a pilot for MSEDCL and MED to identify avenues for adoption of energy and water \nconservation through tariffs and improved subsidy administration to increase the sustainability of \nthe HVDS program. The HVDS dashboard would allow MSEDCL management and stakeholders, \nincluding other government departments, to track the relevant information on HVDS customers.  \n \n \n19 ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n21 Out of 13.7 million farmers in the state,78.6% are small and marginal farmers, each with less than 2 hectares of land. \n ", "10 \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n29.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  MSEDCL\u2019s  existing  monitoring  system  is                  \nERP-based. MSEDCL has invested in software to track new applications for connections, network \noperation and maintenance, meter reading and billing, capital projects, and financial transactions. \nMSEDCL is using a geographic information system to tag and determine the requirements for \nconnecting each new customer to the network, which supports easier verification of quantities. \nMSEDCL staff use smart phones and employee applications to ensure that field data is directly \nuploaded, up-to-date, and traceable. Prominent performance indicators tracked include electricity \nsales,  distribution  loss,  network  reliability,  tariffs,  cost  of  supply,  load-shedding,  project \nimplementation and financial indicators. The system can monitor DLI performance; a customized \nHVDS reporting dashboard is being implemented (DLI 8) to provide monthly monitoring and \nquarterly progress reports and information flows to the MED. During due diligence, MSEDCL \nagreed to implement a sampling and data collection system to report on quality of power supply \nfor agricultural customers (DLI 3). To complement monitoring and evaluation, the IVA will verify \ninformation related to the DLIs and monitor PAP implementation for compliance. The state \ngovernment\u2019s Directorate of Economics and Statistics will evaluate program performance and \nimpact through external parties. \n \n30.  Fiduciary systems. MSEDCL follows the rules and regulations set under the Companies \nAct, 2013 for corporate governance and financial reporting and its operations are governed by \nthe regulatory framework provided under the Electricity Act, 2003, and rules and regulations \nenacted by MERC.22 The RBL program will use MSEDCL\u2019s fiduciary systems for financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  audits  and  anticorruption.  These  systems  were  assessed  to \ndetermine their ability to manage fiduciary risks and provide assurances that the RBL program \nfunds will be used as intended, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.23  \n \n31.  The overall fiduciary risk is rated as moderate. MSEDCL has substantial capacity to \nundertake the RBL program, with a well-structured finance and accounts function headed by \nqualified professionals. It has a transparent and efficient management system with ERP systems, \ncentralized billing and management dashboards. MSEDCL has an effective budgetary planning \nand control system with an internal audit function that performs well and has maintained a fixed \nasset and inventory register through the ERP. However, improvements are needed for timely \ncompletion of physical verification of assets, internal controls for financial reporting and to address \nthe qualified audit opinion. These are being implemented and addressed in the PAP. \n \n32.  The procurement assessment covered the procurement profile of the RBL program, and \ncountry- and agency-level procurement assessments. The RBL program will rely on MSEDCL\u2019s \nsystems and will exclude high-value contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy.24 MSEDCL \nhas a well-defined, transparent, and accountable procurement process and uses electronic \nprocurement. The procurement process covers the preparation of cost estimates, evaluation \nprocedures, confidentiality, staff performance review, and the appeals mechanism defined in \nMSEDCL  and  state  procurement  guidelines.  The  scope  for  procurement  includes  turnkey \ncontracts and goods. The goods packages that are about 11% of the total RBL program in value \n \n22 Electricity is a concurrent subject in India, which is governed by both central and state governments. The overarching \nframework is provided by the national Electricity Act, 2003 and the specific and operational rules and regulations are \nprovided by the individual state electricity regulatory commissions. \n23 Program Fiduciary Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs. Manila. High-value contacts are those with estimated \nvalue over $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 million for \ninformation technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n ", "11 \nand consisting of relatively low-value transactions at an average cost of $1 million, include a \nprovision to split a contract if qualified bidders from the state of Maharashtra volunteer to reduce \nprices to match the lowest competitive bid received. This is specified in the bidding document and \nis followed in several Indian states. The overall procurement risk is assessed as moderate. \n  \n33.  The anticorruption framework of the RBL program is effective. The state government of \nMaharashtra has established an Anti-Corruption Bureau to investigate complaints against public \nservants involving abuse of position and corruption. MSEDCL has a well-structured anticorruption \nfunction with five vigilance cells dealing with complaints including corruption, embezzlement, and \nfraud charges against its officers. MSEDCL has developed an online grievance redress system \nfor customers to log complaints and provide feedback on services. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to the government and MSEDCL (footnote 25) and are part of the PAP. \n \n34.  Safeguard systems. A program systems safeguard assessment (PSSA) was prepared. \nThe RBL program is classified as category B for environment and involuntary resettlement, and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nDue diligence was conducted on the activities including construction and augmentation of 33/11 \nkV substations, 11 kV lines, distribution transformers, and connections. MSEDCL confirmed that \nland acquisition is not proposed for connections and the program is demand-driven. The 33/11 \nkV distribution substation would typically be on barren government land. If private land acquisition \nis required, it would be through voluntary donation or direct purchase with no involuntary land \nacquisition. The distribution lines will originate from the nearest existing 11 kV line and the \nalignment will follow rights-of-way of existing roads or unused land between agricultural plots \nwithout intruding on private property. Activities located in or directly adjacent to key biodiversity \nareas or national protected areas\u2014including wildlife sanctuaries or reserves, forests, and cultural \nheritage sites\u2014will be excluded from the RBL program through the application of the safeguard \nscreening guidance. The RBL program activities will not cause significant, irreversible, diverse, \nor  unprecedented  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Potential  construction-related \nimpacts from pole and line installation and operation include air and liquid emissions, waste etc. \nwith  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  impacts.  The  impacts  associated  with \nconstruction and operation will be managed by MSEDCL by implementing relevant national \nregulations and company practices. Indigenous peoples are not targeted beneficiaries, although \nthe RBL program will not exclude them. The RBL program will not adversely impact indigenous \npeoples, their cultural identity, survival, cultural resources, or livelihood systems. \n \n35.  In addition, policy equivalent assessment was undertaken to compare national, state, and \nagency-level policies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). There are well-defined \nlegislative frameworks for environment and social safeguards in India and Maharashtra. MSEDCL \nrules and practices on safeguard matters are institutionalized and there is a specific grievance \nredress mechanism. However, gaps in procedural matters (site screening, record keeping, and \nmonitoring) have been identified and environmental and social management system (ESMS)25  \nguidelines,  tools  and  formats  have  been  developed  for  the  RBL  program.  Meaningful \nconsultations were undertaken, and the results incorporated. MSEDCL has identified staff from \nhead office and in each division to undertake the safeguard activities. The PMU will implement \nthe safeguard PAP and ESMS for the RBL program and report to ADB through semiannual \nmonitoring reports. Consultants under the TA will guide the PMU and monitor implementation. \n \n25 It  consists of  a  set  of  guiding  documents  including safeguards  screening,  due  diligence  template,  generic \nenvironment management plan, safeguards monitoring template, consultation template, and guidelines for voluntary \ndonation and direct purchase. These are developed as an ESMS for this program. \n ", "12 \nThe PSSA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in September 2019. A climate risk assessment was \nconducted, and the potential risks are assessed as medium, including increase in rainfall and \ntemperatures. These potential risks will be addressed in the technical design. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall benefits and \nimpact are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRating Without \nRisks  the Mitigating  Key Mitigating Measures \nMeasures \nResults.
