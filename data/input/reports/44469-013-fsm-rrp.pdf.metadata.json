The \nproject will include (i) construction of about 1.4 megawatts (MW) of wind power, (ii) construction \nof  about  300  kilowatts  (kW)  of  grid-connected  solar  power,  (iii)  installation  of  a  1.8  MW  diesel \ngenerator  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  current  power  generation  facilities,  and  (iv)  capacity \nbuilding within the Yap power utility and communities.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  project  will  support  the  development  of  the  power  system  in  Yap  so  as  to  reduce \ndependency  on  imported  diesel.  This  will  be  achieved  through  expanding  renewable  power \ngeneration and improving the supply-side efficiencies of power delivery. \n \n4. \nYap,  with  a  population  of  11,400,  is  one  of  four  states  within  the  FSM  with  a  total \npopulation  of  107,000.  Currently,  Yap  is  100%  dependent  on  imported  diesel  for  power \ngeneration on the main island (referred to as Yap proper). Power generation is supplied by Yap \nState  Public  Services Corporation  (YSPSC),  which  is  a  100%  state-owned corporatized  utility. \nEach  state  in  the  FSM  has  a  separate  utility  corporation  with  separate  tariff  structures.  About \n65% of the population of Yap lives on Yap proper, the others live on the outer islands. There is a \nsingle power grid  on  Yap  proper  with an  installed capacity  of  8.3  MW and  peak  load 2.4  MW, \nserving about 1,500 residential customers. Access to electricity at an estimated 97% is high on \nYap proper.3  \n \n5. \nDue  to remoteness and high diesel  transportation  costs,  power  tariffs  are high and  the \nYap economy is very vulnerable to fuel price shocks. In 2011, the electricity tariff reached $0.35 \nper  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  residential  customers,  $0.42/kWh  for  commercial  customers,  and \n$0.77/kWh  for  public  institutions.  The  late  2011  total  cost  of  energy  generated  and  delivered \nwas $0.54/kWh.4 In 2008, the value of diesel fuel imported by Yap was the highest single import \ncost  item  with  over  80%  of  imported  diesel  fuel  used  for  power  generation.  Fuel  imports \nrepresented  about  15% of  Yap\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in 2008.  Power  tariffs  currently  allow \nfor full cost recovery for YSPSC to undertake required operation and maintenance activities and \nservice  long-term  debt.  YSPSC  has  a  project  in  the  water  sector  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  and  has  been  maintaining the  repayments  to the  state government \nsatisfactorily.5 \n \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  supported  the  preparation  of  the  project.  ADB.  2009. \nTechnical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  the  Capacity  of  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries  to  Respond  to \nClimate Change. Manila. (TA 7394-REG).  \n\n3  As a result, there is very limited private installed backup generation and limited unmet demand on Yap proper.  \n4  The tariff structure includes a lifeline tariff to support low-income households.  \n5   ADB.  1996.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  (L1459-FSM).  Manila.  ADB  has  also  supported  the  Yap  State \nthrough  ADB.  2004.  Omnibus  Infrastructure  Development  Project.  Manila  (L2099-FSM  (SF)  and  L2100-FSM; \nimplementing agency: Gagil-Tomil Water Authority).    \n\n\f2 \n\nThe power supply in Yap is relatively stable and YSPSC pursues a well-defined program \n6. \nof preventive maintenance, which ensures reliable power supply to a relatively compact power \nsystem.6 As a result there are relatively high efficiencies on the supply side for transmission and \ndistribution. But the diesel generators are oversized, resulting in low supply-side efficiencies for \ngeneration.7 Due to a predominance of traditional buildings, residential electricity consumption is \nlow  at  about  180  kWh/month  per  residential  meter,  and  relatively  efficient;  however,  power \nusage by government offices is rather high.8 Due to low terrain and small catchments, Yap does \nnot have potential for hydropower. There is currently no wind power generation in Yap, but there \nare  several  solar  power  mini-grids  in  the  outer  islands  that  YSPSC  manages.  Wind  and  solar \npower are the only forms of renewable energy currently considered suitable for Yap. As a result \nof its operation of the outer-island solar installations, YSPSC has experience in installation and \noperation of grid-connected solar power. \n \n7. \nThe  project  is  proposing  to  support  the  (i)  development  of  grid-connected  wind  power \ngeneration of about 1.4 MW, (ii) development of grid-connected solar power of about 300 kW, \n(iii) improvement  of  generation  efficiencies  in  existing  diesel  generation  through  a  new,  more \nefficient  1.8  MW  diesel  generator,  and  (iv)  provision  of  project  management  support  and \ncapacity building for YSPSC. It is estimated that the project will enable Yap to convert 22.2% of \nits power generation to renewable energy. Additional fuel savings through stronger supply-side \nenergy  efficiency  will  lower  diesel  consumption  for  power  generation  by  25%.9 Conversion  to \nrenewable energy will stabilize power tariffs by reducing the transient impact of fluctuating diesel \nprices,  and  enable  YSPSC  to  control  tariff  increases  through  partial  hedging  against  rising \ndiesel  prices.  Grid  analysis  has  indicated  that  grid  integration  of  this  level  of  intermittent \nrenewable energy will not cause grid instability. \n \n The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u2013201410 for the \n8. \nFSM,  which  prioritizes  energy  as  a  key  area  of  support,  and  with  the  FSM\u2019s  draft  National \nEnergy  Policy,11 which  includes  the  draft  Yap  State  Energy  Action  Plan.  The  draft  National \nEnergy  Policy  sets  a  national  renewable  energy  generation  target  of  30%  by  2020.  All  project \noutputs  are  listed  in  the  Yap  State  Energy  Action  Plan  as  priority  activities.  The  project  will \nenable the State of Yap to meet about 74% of its contribution to the national energy target.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the project will be that Yap's energy security has improved. The outcome \n\n9. \nof the project will be that YSPSC supplies more clean, renewable energy to Yap.  \n \n\n                                                \n6  The  distribution  system  consists  of  124  kilometers  of  13.8-kilovolt  overhead  lines.  There  is  no  high-voltage \n\ntransmission line.  \n\n7   Current  generator configuration is  2  x  3.3  MW  Deutz,  2  x  0.5  MW White  Superiors,  and  1  x  0.7  MW Alco  diesel \ngenerators. Power is primarily supplied by the Deutz engines. The White Superiors and the Alco are suitable for \nbackup but not for baseload generation. Peak demand of 2.4 MW and night load of around 1.5 MW mean that the \nDeutz  engines  are  generally  operated  at  low  loading  and  low  efficiencies.  Generation  was  installed  to  support \nindustrial demand, which has subsequently declined.   \n\n8  Demand-side energy audits are being finalized for government buildings, and the European Union is proposing to \n\nsupport implementation of the audit reports.  \n\n9  Due to current high levels of access to electricity (an estimated 97%), the project will not increase energy access \non  Yap  proper.  Access  rates  on  the  outer  islands  are  lower.  However,  the  European  Union  is  assisting  Yap  in \ninstalling solar-based mini-grids throughout the outer islands.  \n\n10 ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Federated States of Micronesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n11 Approval of the Draft National Energy Policy is anticipated by June 2013. \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have the following outputs: \n\n10. \n \n11.  Wind  power.  YSPSC  installs  generation  of  about  1.4  MW  to  be  constructed  in  two \nphases (about 0.5 MW in phase 1 and about 0.9 MW in phase 2). The wind farm will be built on \na  ridgeline  adjacent  to  the  main  urban  center  (Colonia)  on  Yap  proper.  The  wind  farm  will \ninclude (i) wind turbines with anticipated height of about 60 meters high, and capacity of 100\u2013\n300  kW  each,  designed  to  withstand  typhoon  conditions;  (ii) underground  power  lines  and \nelectrical  systems;  (iii)  about  800  meters  of  above-ground  distribution  connection,  including \ntransformer,  to  the  local  grid;  (iv)  2  kilometers  (km)  of  access  road,  and  (v)  a  communication \nsystem. Both stages of the  wind farm will be tendered through a single design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013\ntransfer  contract.  The  wind  farm  is  anticipated  to  generate  2.12 gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per \nannum, equal to 18.2% of the current energy delivery in Yap.12 \n \n12. \nSolar  power. YSPSC installs generation of about 300 kW through grid-connected solar \npanels on government building roofs on about 21 buildings at four sites across Yap. It will own \nand operate the installations. This output will include installation of solar panels, inverters, and \nrelated electrical equipment to connect to the grid. Training will be provided to local companies \nfor  construction  of  the  solar  installations  and  to  establish  local  maintenance  capacity.  Solar \npower  is  expected  to  provide  0.46  GWh/annum  to  the  grid,  equal  to  4.0%  of  current  energy \ndelivery in Yap. \n \n13. \nDiesel power. YSPSC improves the efficiency of diesel power generation by installing a \nnew  high-efficiency,  medium-speed  diesel  engine  of  1.8  MW  capacity,  providing \n9.9 GWh/annum. During off-peak hours of operation, the generator will run at significantly higher \nfuel  efficiency  of  15.0kWh/gallon,  than  the  existing  diesel  generators  which  operate  at  13.8 \nkWh/gallon. \n \n14. \nEfficient  project  management  services.  This  means  establishing  a  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  that  will  provide  efficient  technical  design,  management,  and \nconstruction  supervision  services.  The  output  will  finance  consultants  to  undertake  training \nactivities for  PMU  staff and YSPSC  management,  including technical  capacity  training,  project \nmanagement training, and gender awareness training.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $11.16 million, as shown in Table 1. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                \n12 The  maximum  combined  phase  1  wind  and  solar  grid  integration  is  anticipated  to  peak  at  40%.  The  grid  will  be \n\nanalyzed during phase 1 to determine system constraints for the development of phase 2 wind generation.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

The  OCR  loan  will  have  a  25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft guarantee and \nloan  agreements.  The  national  and  state  governments  have  requested  that  repayment  will \nfollow the custom-tailored repayment option, and that the repayment dates will be 1 June and 1 \nDecember. Based on the above loan terms and these repayment option and dates, the average \nloan  maturity  is  16.67 years,  which  means  that  the  loan  will  be  subject  to  a  0.20%  maturity \npremium.  Under  the  custom-tailored  repayment  method  each  installment  is  calculated  as  a \npercentage of the total loan amount as follows: 1% from the 1st to the 6th principal repayment \ndate; 2% from the 7th to the 14th principal repayment date; and 3% from the 15th to the 40th \nprincipal repayment date. \n \n17. \nThe  national  and state governments  have also requested  a sovereign-guaranteed loan \nin various currencies  equivalent to  SDR2,896,000 from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds (ADF)  resources \nto  help  finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5 \nyears, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth \nin the draft guarantee and loan agreements.13  \n \n18. \nThe Government  of  the FSM  will  provide  a  sovereign guarantee for the OCR  loan and \nthe  ADF  loan,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the \neffectiveness  of  the  OCR  loan  and  ADF  loan.  The  Yap  State  Government  will  onlend  the \nproceeds  of  the  OCR  loan  and  the  ADF  loan  to  YSPSC  under  subsidiary  loan  agreements \nacceptable to ADB. The  terms for  onlending the  proceeds  of  the OCR  loan and ADF loan will \ninclude the same respective interest rates and repayment periods as those of the OCR loan and \nADF loan.  \n \n\n                                                \n13 Financing charges during implementation under the ADF loan will be capitalized.  \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\nThe  Yap  State  Government  will  finance  the  remainder  of  the  total  project  cost  in  the \n\n19. \namount of $2.12 million, including local taxes and duties.

A  PMU  will  be  established  within \nYSPSC and will be responsible for implementing the project. YSPSC will provide a PMU project \nmanager  (senior  technical  manager),  accounting  support,  and  a  lands  officer.  The  project  will \nfinance  additional  staff, equipment,  and  office furnishings  to  support the PMU  in  implementing \nthe  outputs.  The  additional  staffing  will  consist  of  an  electrical  engineer  (solar),  electrical \nengineer  (wind),  environment  specialist,  social  specialist  (to  oversee  implementation  of  the \ngender  action  and  resettlement  plans),  structural  engineer,  procurement  specialist  and  wind \nmonitoring  specialist.  Consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10,  which  is  considered  justified  due  to  the \ntechnical  complexity  of  the  wind  and  solar  components.  Consultants  may  also  be  recruited \nthrough  individual  consultant  selection,  which  is  considered  justified  due  to  the  difficulties  in \nfinding  consulting  companies  that  have  on  staff  the  broad  technical  spread  of  required \nspecialists, and owing to the limited pool of consultants with the required technical and country \nexpertise. ADB financing for PMU strengthening is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for capacity \ndevelopment  output.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The PMU will be responsible for \nengaging  all  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  civil  works  contracts.  A  project  steering \ncommittee  will  oversee  implementation,  monitor  progress,  and  provide  guidance  to  the \nexecuting  agency.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  will  be  chaired  by  the \nlieutenant governor of Yap. YSPSC will host the project steering committee and will act as the \nsecretariat. \n \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  4.5  years,  with  completion  estimated  by  June \n21. \n2017.

For  the  wind  farm  design,  wind  resource  modeling  was  carried  out  to \ndetermine the most suitable site, and site-specific wind measurements helped assess financial \nviability  based  on  a  conservative  90%  exceedance  probability  scenario. 15  Data  will  be \nreconfirmed  through  a  site-specific  wind  monitoring  mast  that  will  be  installed  for  monitoring \nover  a  full  year.  For  the  solar  installations,  available  panel  technology  was  reviewed  before \nselection. Specifications tailored to the Pacific were prepared to improve system sustainability. \nFor the diesel generator component, the design was based on extensive experience in Yap  in \noperation and maintenance of diesel generators. Alternative designs were assessed to ensure \nleast-cost  design.  The  proposed  solar  and  wind  technology  is  installed  across the  Pacific  and \nhas  a  proven  track  record  of  reliability  in  Pacific  conditions.  Standard  equipment  of  known \ndesign was selected to increase the availability of parts. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  consolidated  project  is \n23. \n12.9%,  with  an  economic  net  present  value  (ENPV)  of  $0.57  million.  At  the  90%  wind  speed \nexceedance level, the two-stage wind project produces 2.1 GWh/year. At that output, the EIRR \nis  11.5%,  and  the  levelized  cost  of  energy  (LCOE)  is  $0.39/kWh.  If  only  the  first  stage  is \n\n                                                \n15 This is the probability that the wind resource used in the design will be achieved 90% of the time.  \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nconsidered, at the 90% exceedance level the EIRR is 8.9% and the LCOE is $0.44/kWh.16 The \n300 kW grid-connected solar component, producing 0.44 GWh of energy annually, has an EIRR \nof  11.4%  and  LCOE  of  $0.40/kWh.  The  1.8  MW  diesel  generator  will  produce  9.9  GWh  of \nenergy  annually  and  will  have  an  EIRR  of  15.6%,  ENPV  of  $0.79  million,  and  LCOE  of \n$0.40/kWh, including initial cost and fuel and maintenance costs calculated over its 25-year life \ncycle.  \n \n24. \nFinancial.  The  financial  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  consolidated \nproject (all three energy components combined, under the 2-stage wind case) is 13.0%, with a \nfinancial  net  present  value  (FNPV)  of  $15.8  million.  This  compares  favorably  to  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  1.86%.  The  full  two-stage  wind  energy  component  has  an  FIRR  of \n11.4%  and  a  FNPV  of  $7.3  million. 17 The  financial  LCOE  from  the  two-stage  wind  project, \ncalculated over its 25-year life cycle, is $0.22/kWh. If only the first stage is considered, the wind \nfarm  has  an  FIRR  of  8.7%  and  an  FNPV  of  $2.3  million.  The  financial  LCOE  from  the  single-\nstage  wind  project  is  $0.26/kWh.  The  grid-connected  solar  component  has  an  FIRR  of  11.6% \nand an NPV of $2.0 million. The LCOE from the solar installation, calculated over its 25-year life \ncycle,  is  $0.20/kWh.  The  diesel  generation  component  has  an  FIRR  of  15.9%  and  an  NPV  of \n$6.7 million. The LCOE, including initial cost and fuel and maintenance costs calculated over its \n25-year life cycle, is $0.42/kWh. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nto  accommodate \n\n25. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  completed  for \nYSPSC,  including  a  review  of  the  accounting  and  reporting  system,  internal  and  external \nauditing, fund disbursement,  and information  system.18 The  assessment  indicated that  existing \naccounting  policies  and  procedures  are  adequate \nthe  management \nrequirements of the project and that there are no significant weaknesses in YSPSC\u2019s accounting \npolicies,  information  systems,  or  accounting  and  reporting  procedures.  The  YSPSC  has  well-\ndeveloped capacity in financial management, and its qualified personnel includes an accounting \nmanager,  a  comptroller\u2019s  consultant  (the  position  of  comptroller  is  currently  vacant),  a  payroll \naccountant, a purchasing and supply accountant, and a customer service manager, supported \nby clerks and other subordinate personnel. The accounting manager carries out internal audits \non an ongoing basis, with reporting to the board of directors, as the utility is too small to warrant \nthe  creation  of  a  separate  internal  auditing  section.  YSPSC  utilizes  the  commercial  software \npackage Peachtree for all accounting functions and financial reporting. A policies and procedure \nmanual  guides  accounting  and  other  management  functions.  Staff  qualifications  and  job \ndescriptions  are  contained  in  a  personnel  manual.  The  financial  management  assessment \nindicated  that  YSPSC  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  loan  repayments  and  maintain \nseparate project accounts suitable for auditing purposes. \n \nProcurement  capacity.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed  for \n26. \nYSPSC,  which  indicated  that  YSPSC  has  an  established  procurement  unit  with  considerable \nprocurement  experience.  However,  the  experience  is  largely  related  to  procurement  of  small \nequipment packages, and YSPSC has limited experience in managing large contract packages \nduring  either tender  preparation or construction supervision.  Additionally,  while the  capacity  of \nindividual  staff  is  relatively  high,  there  is  limited  depth  of  capacity.  There  is  also  limited \n                                                \n16 The  relatively  low  EIRR  is  considered  justified  due  to  the  unquantified  economic  benefits  related  to  reduced \n\nmaintenance costs and environmental benefits.   \n\n17  Based on a 90% exceedance level. \n18 ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nexperience with ADB standard procurement documents. Based on this risk evaluation the PMU \nwas  designed  to  include  an  international  procurement  specialist  who  will  train  YSPSC  staff  in \npreparing  tender  documents  for  the  design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  contract  for  the  wind  farm, \nand manage preparation of ADB standard tender documents. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  national  and  state  governments  and  YSPSC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.19 \n \n28. \nPrivate  sector.  Because  of  the  small  size  of  the  Yap  power  system  and  the  marginal \nfinancial viability of the subprojects under commercial lending conditions, the state government \ndoes  not  currently  consider  development  of  generation  assets  through  independent  power \nproducers.  Due to the  highly  technical  nature  of wind  power  generation,  the  private  sector  will \nbe  involved  in  long-term  maintenance  contracts  for  the  wind  farm.  A  long-term  maintenance \ncontract  will  also  be  established  for  the  new  diesel  generator,  as  is  current  practice  for  the \nexisting  diesel  generators.  Capacity  building  activities  will  also  be  undertaken  for  local  private \nsector companies to support construction of the solar power generation. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  stabilizing  power  tariffs  for  commercial  and \n29. \ndomestic power consumers in Yap proper, including low-income households; (ii) engaging low-\nincome households,  including  landowners, to undertake  construction  projects;  (iii) encouraging \nprivate  sector  growth  through  stabilized  power  tariffs;  (iv)  providing  technical  training  for  local \ncontractors  to  develop  a  support  industry  for  the  solar  installations;  and  (v) facilitating  income \ngeneration opportunities through wind farm designs that ensure tourism access to World War II \nheritage sites and viewing points.  \n \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \n30. \nbeen developed based on gender analysis and community consultations, and includes specific \nmeasures related to the construction of the wind farm and solar installations. Measures include \n(i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation activities, (ii) provision of gender awareness training to \ntarget  groups,  (iii)  training  of  women  to  participate  in  income  generating  activities  (including \ntourism activities related to the wind farm site), (iv) actions to encourage women\u2019s participation \nin project related contracts, and (v) collection of gender-related data for monitoring purposes. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nEnvironment. The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B for  environment following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An initial environmental examination has been prepared for \nthe project. The main potential environmental impacts identified include (i) noise from the wind \nturbines,  (ii)  impacts  on  flora  and  fauna  during  construction  of  the  wind  farm,  and  (iii)  soil \nerosion during construction of the wind farm. A heritage survey was conducted at the proposed \nwind farm site, and sites to be avoided during construction were specified. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures  were  incorporated  into  the  environmental  management  plan  as  part  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination. The plan will be included in the wind farm construction contract.

The project has been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  does  not  involve  physical  displacement  of  people  or \nstructures.  There  will  be  no  impact  on  distinct  and  vulnerable  indigenous  peoples.  The  wind \nfarm to be built on Kabul and Madeqdeq ridges, however, requires acquisition of 7.5 hectares of \nland.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared.  YSPSC  will  update  and  finalize  the  plan  during \nproject implementation after detailed design and survey of the wind farm. YSPSC will coordinate \nwith the state government, the Division of Land Resources, and other relevant government and \nnongovernment  agencies  to  implement  and  monitor  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation \nactivities. \n \n33. \nSafeguard documents have been endorsed by the Yap State Government, disclosed to \naffected persons and local stakeholders, and posted on ADB's website. The project will support \ncapacity  within  YSPSC  to  manage  safeguard  aspects  through  international  and  national \nenvironment,  and  social  safeguard  specialists  who  will  be  working  within  the  PMU.  They  will \norganize and conduct trainings on safeguards and other necessary skills to the relevant staff of \nYSPSC, the Division of Land Resources, and other agencies that will be involved in the project\u2019s \nsafeguard activities. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 21  The  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nassessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLow capacity of local contractors results in \nreliance on high-cost external contractors.  \n\nInsufficient procurement capacity within the \nimplementing agency to manage ADB \nprocurement procedures. \nInsufficient financial management capacity \nwithin the implementing agency. \n\nMitigating Measures \nLocal contractors will be trained on the construction of solar \ninstallations. Outreach to contractors prior to bidding will \nprovide dialogue on perceived issues and development of \noptions to address perceived risks. Meetings will be held \nwith potential contractors to encourage engagement in \nbidding process, in order to increase competition and lower \nprices.  \nInternational procurement specialists will be included in the \nPMU. PMU staff will be trained on ADB procurement \nprocedures by June 2013. \nMeasures will include (i) monitoring of financial \nmanagement during implementation, (ii) not using imprest \naccounts, (iii) inclusion of financial specialists within the \nPMU, (iv) capacity raining in financial management, (v) \nrequirement for submittal of annual project account audited \nby an independent auditor, and (vi) PMU maintaining \nseparate project records and accounts.  \n\n                                                \n20 Application  for  Clean  Development  Mechanism  financing  is  not  considered  warranted  as  the  transaction  costs \n\nwould exceed the estimated revenue from CO2 emission reductions.  \n\n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nLandowner disputes delay implementation.
