THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Maharashtra Agribusiness Network Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Enhancing Market Linkages for Farmer Producer Organizations, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will increase the incomes of small and marginal farmers in Maharashtra in line \nwith the state government\u2019s Vision 2030 by providing holistic agribusiness and value chain \nsupport in horticulture.2 The project will enhance (i) the capacities of agribusiness institutions and \nfarmer producer organizations (FPOs), (ii) access to finance of FPOs and value chain operators \n(VCOs), and (iii) horticulture value chain infrastructure.3 The infrastructure will use designs that \nare  responsive  to  gender  and  people  with  disabilities,  and  include  climate  adaptation  and \nmitigation financing. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Maharashtra\u2019s  economy  and  agriculture.  Maharashtra  is India\u2019s  largest  economic \ncontributor, accounting for 13.8% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). However, the \nstate\u2019s economic development is concentrated around major cities. The state has India\u2019s fourth \nlargest rural population and share of people living below the poverty line.4 In rural Maharashtra \n24.2% of the population still lived below the poverty line in 2011,5 and it is estimated that the share \nof rural poor is even higher in 2018.6 The rural poverty rate is as high as 40%, especially in poor \nnorthern and eastern districts. The average income per capita in the poorest rural district is 28% \nof that in Mumbai, the state\u2019s district with the highest income. In rural areas, 72.2% of working \npopulation earn below the recommended national minimum wage. Agriculture contributes 15% of \nMaharashtra\u2019s GDP, and 68% of the rural labor force is engaged in the sector (footnote 5). The \nGDP  growth  rate  for  agriculture  (2.9%)  was  outpaced  by  other  sectors  during  fiscal  year \n(FY)2013\u2013FY2020  compared  to  the  state  average  of  6.6%.  The  total  area  for  agricultural \nproduction has remained at around 20 million hectares (ha) since the 1970s, but the average size \nof operational holdings has steadily declined, from 4.3 ha in FY1971 to 1.3 ha in FY2016. As a \nresult, the number of small and marginal farmers was 12.1 million in FY2016, which is 79.5% of \nMaharashtra\u2019s farmers.7 \n \n4.  Horticulture subsector. India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in \nthe  world.  Through  various  programs  and  initiatives  since  the  1990s,  Maharashtra  has \n \n1  Of which (i) $0.5 million will be provided by Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Funds and (ii) $2.0 million will \nbe provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. \n2  State Government of Maharashtra, Planning Department. 2017. Vision 2030. Mumbai. \n3  VCOs targeted in the project include aggregators, processors, exporters, retail organizations, and agri-technology \norganizations. \n4  World Bank. 2017. Maharashtra Poverty, Growth and Inequality. Delhi. \n5  State Government of Maharashtra, Directorate of Economics and Statistics. 2021. Economic Survey of Maharashtra \n2020\u20132021. Mumbai. The poverty line was estimated at \u20b9967 per capita per month in rural areas. \n6  It is estimated that the share of rural poor rose to 48.8%, more than double the share in urban areas (20.4%) in 2018 \nbased on the Household Usual Monthly Consumer Expenditure (Source: Government of India, Ministry of Statistics \nand Programme Implementation, National Statistical Office. 2020. Annual Report on Periodic Labour Force Survey \n(July 2018\u2013June 2019). Delhi.). The poverty line used in this estimate was \u20b91,435 per capita per month in rural areas. \n7  Small and marginal holding farmers are defined as farmers with a landholding size of 2 ha or less (footnote 5). \n ", "2 \ntransitioned to become one of India\u2019s largest producers and exporters of horticulture products.8 \nThe state produced 25.9 million tons of fruits and vegetables in FY2020, of which 0.2 million tons \nworth $169 million were exported. The area under fruit crops increased by 341% during FY1991\u2013\nFY2018. The demand for fruits and vegetables is expected to increase by 4%\u20137% annually during \n2015\u20132025,  driven  by  the  increasing  and  diversifying  demand  from  the  middle-income \npopulation.9 Maharashtra is also among the leading producers of flowers such as roses, gerberas, \ncarnations, and marigolds. It accounts for about 8% of total floriculture exports from India and \nproduction grew at 7.7% annually during 2015\u20132019. The state government has supported \nhorticultural production to improve the productivity of mainly rain-fed cultivated land.10 Agricultural \nproductivity of horticulture, in terms of value per gross crop area, is almost 50% higher than for \nfood grains.11 Also, horticulture production is often accompanied by processing, which provides \nyear-round employment opportunities, especially for women. \n \n5.  Fresh fruits, vegetables, and flowers are highly perishable. Almost 40% of these crops are \nlost or wasted in different stages of the existing value chains, and 60% of such waste happens \nbetween the farm and the end consumer (footnote 9). The losses can be reduced by proper post-\nharvest  practices  and  value  chain  facilities,  especially  through  cold  chains.12 Cold  chain \ndevelopment is challenging because of high initial investment requirements for refrigeration units \nand  land,  limited  supporting  infrastructure for  power  supply  and  transport,  and  inadequate \ncapacity in handling perishable produce. Enhancing FPO and VCO networks with storage and \ncold chain facilities can significantly reduce agriculture wastage and greenhouse gas emission \nwhile increasing business opportunities and contributing to food safety and security. \n \n6.  Despite ample opportunities for growth of horticulture in Maharashtra, most smallholding \nfarmers still practice subsistence farming. They do not utilize recent agriculture and marketing \ntechnologies, nor grow produce in volume to sell in the markets because of a fragmented land \nownership structure. Most FPOs do not have (i) sufficient capital to start operations at meaningful \nscale;13 and (ii) direct access to emerging high-value markets, and instead rely on traditional \nmarketing channels involving multiple layers of traders and preharvest contracts. \n \n7.  Government\u2019s agriculture strategies. In 2017, the Government of India launched a \nstrategy for doubling farmers\u2019 income by supporting agribusiness development as a vehicle to \nincrease farming incomes and integrate marginal holding farmers into an efficient food supply \nsystem.14 The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare issued guidelines including support \nschemes for agribusiness models, production and post-harvest infrastructure, innovation and \nagri-enterprise development, and promotion of FPOs. In September 2020, India enacted three \nfarm reform bills to benefit the farming community through efficient supply chains and reduced \n \n8  Such programs and initiatives include Government of Maharashtra. 1996.

In contrast, fruits and vegetables, which accounted for only 5.6% of gross cropped area, accounted \nfor as much as 24.0% of agricultural state domestic product. \n12 Cold chain maintains temperature, relative humidity, and atmosphere around fruits, vegetables, and flowers in a \nspecific range required to keep them fresh, edible, and safe for a longer period than in normal ambient conditions. \n13 86% of FPOs have paid-up capital of less than \u20b91 million (R. Govil, A. Neti, and M. R. Rao. 2020. Farmer Producer \nCompanies\u2014Past, Present and Future. Bangalore). \n14 Government of India. 2017.

New Delhi. \n ", "3 \ntrade barriers.15 In 2000\u20132009, Maharashtra had already started creating an enabling ecosystem \nby proactively introducing policy reforms by (i) delisting fruits and vegetables from mandated \ntrading in regulated markets, (ii) issuing direct trading licenses to more than 1,000 FPOs and \nVCOs, and (iii) initiating contract farming to give farmers some price assurances.16 Maharashtra \nrecognizes agriculture as the backbone of the state and aims to transform the sector to be \nprofitable by improving the yield and quality of horticulture products and filling infrastructure and \nother gaps in transport, storage, market links, cold chain, and agro-processing (footnote 2). \n \n8.  In 2020, Maharashtra initiated the Vikel Te Pikel (\"grow that sells\") program to support \nfarmers and FPOs to grow crops based on market demand and connect with value chains.17 This \ninitiative, together with the central government\u2019s reform bills, will promote drastic shifts from the \nincumbent layered and controlled marketing structures to more direct and efficient marketing. The \nstate aims to achieve an average annual growth rate of more than 5% for the agriculture sector \nby 2030 and finds it necessary to support farmers by providing quality inputs, investing in post-\nharvest technology for value addition, promoting FPOs, establishing value chains through public\u2013\nprivate partnerships, extending credit lines, and promoting direct marketing and alternative \nmarkets. The Government of India included an ambitious target of forming 10,000 new FPOs in \n5 years from FY2020. By the end of FY2019, Maharashtra state government was able to support \nregistration of 1,940 FPOs and operated several subsidy schemes. However, FPOs\u2019 institutional, \ntechnical, and financial capacities are limited in farming, post-harvest handling, and marketing, \nand their decision-making is typically dominated by men. \n \n9.  Coronavirus disease. As of August 2021, Maharashtra was the worst-hit state in India \nby the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It has caused severe disruptions to the \nMaharashtra economy, which affected the agriculture food supply chain and resulted in food \ninflation during the first 7 months of 2020. Lockdowns interrupted harvests by farmers and \nmachinery  operators,  and  intermittently  closed  markets,  affecting  farmers\u2019  incomes.  Wage \nlaborers  migrated  from  urban  areas  to  villages,  but  current  small-scale  landholdings  and \ntraditional  farming  practices  limited  the  sector  from  taking  in  additional  labor.  Monthly \nunemployment rates sharply increased, from 8.8% in March 2020 to 23.5% in May 2020.18 \nApproximately a half of women agricultural laborers went without a single day of paid work during \nthe lockdown months of March\u2013June 2020. In Maharashtra, 43% of low-income households \nreported to have lost 100% of their income and 81% of their pre-crisis income, the highest loss \nrecorded across the fifteen states assessed.19 Returning rural migrants are often highly skilled, \nand they can play a key role in modernizing the agriculture sector. Despite the challenges, the \nsector has started to grow again, with an advance estimate of 11.7% growth in FY2021 (footnote \n5). The project will provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises through start-up \nloans and creating off-farm jobs in agriculture marketing, processing, and managing FPOs. This \nin turn will help Maharashtra absorb additional laborers and boost the rural economy. \n \n \n15  These bills are expected to be made effective upon clearance from the Supreme Court of India. \n16 Government of Maharashtra. 2017.

Evaluation reports of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) call for the \nenhancement  of  comprehensive  agribusiness  and  agricultural  value  chain  approaches  by \nidentifying  key  constraints  and  necessary  links  among  transport,  market,  and  other \ninfrastructure.20 The project will build on the sector wide evaluation, recent agribusiness projects \nin other developing member countries, and more specific lessons learned from ADB\u2019s earlier \nagriculture operations in Maharashtra including (i) applying global best practices of vertical \nintegration of agribusiness value chains and supply chain finance for sustainable food security; \n(ii) avoiding the design flaws of a multitranche financing facility program, in which the use of \npublic\u2013private partnerships did not match the demands of private agribusiness investors; and (iii) \nscaling up successful implementation of a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project, \nwhich supported the creation of FPOs and their marketing activities.21 Past Maharashtra projects \nhave  also  suggested  the  need  for  a  holistic  approach  combining  capacity  building  and \ninfrastructure support, and the importance of providing easier access to affordable finance to \nFPOs.22 \n \n11.  Alignment with government and ADB strategies. The project is aligned with the state \ngovernment\u2019s Vision 2030, ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nIndia.23 The project will address ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of promoting rural \ndevelopment  and  food  security;  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities; \naccelerating progress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity; and fostering regional cooperation and integration.24 A combined financing \nmodality of project loan and financial intermediation loan (FIL) is selected to effectively address \nthe holistic needs of policy guidance, capacity enhancement, access to finance, and infrastructure \nimprovement. The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s private sector agribusiness strategy by \nsupporting farmers along the agribusiness value chain, and beneficiary FPOs and VCOs may \npotentially access ADB\u2019s direct nonsovereign support for their further growth. The project is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India, 2021\u20132023.25 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: average agriculture sector growth rate of \n5% achieved; export of agricultural produce promoted; and fair, competitive, and accessible \nagriculture markets established (footnote 2). The project targets 200 FPOs and 100 VCOs and is \nexpected to benefit 200,000 farmers.26 The project will have the following outcome: Maharashtra\u2019s \nhorticultural production values increased, and post-harvest losses reduced.27 \n \n \n20 ADB. 2018.

The project will provide matching \ngrants and FILs to FPOs and VCOs through 300 subprojects.28 The matching grants will support \ndevelopment of FPOs\u2019 post-harvest facilities and finance up to 60% of development costs, subject \nto a maximum amount of \u20b960 million. The FILs will support working capital and infrastructure \nneeds of FPOs and VCOs for domestic and export markets through financial intermediaries.29 \nSubprojects and sub borrowers will be selected based on the eligibility criteria for the matching \ngrants and FILs set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).30 At least 20% of the \nfinancial support will be allocated to FPOs and VCOs owned or led by women. \n \n15.  Output 3: Agriculture value chain infrastructure improved and operational for the \ntarget horticulture crops. The project will improve 16 existing post-harvest facilities of the \nMaharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) and develop three new ones for the \ndomestic market and export value chains and will improve the facilities of the National Institute of \nPost-Harvest Technology (NIPHT). The post-harvest facilities are typically located adjacent to \nlocal  marketplaces  and  will  provide  safe  and  affordable  access  to  farmers  and  FPOs  for \nprecooling, cold storage, ripening chambers, and processing to reduce losses and add value to \ntheir crops. The facilities will provide 67,600 tons of handling capacity and handle the produce of \n6,200 farmers. Post-harvest facility design will include safe water and sanitation facilities for hand \nwashing and toilets as well as climate mitigation, adaptation, and disaster-resilient features such \nas  rainwater  harvesting.  The  NIPHT  is  a  research  and  development  hub  for  post-harvest \ntechnologies.  The  project  will  enhance  its  training  facilities  with  design  features  that  are \nresponsive to women and people with a disability and use them for FPO capacity-development \nactivities under output 1.31 \n \n28 Matching grants are defined as one-off, nonreimbursable transfers to project beneficiaries, for particular purposes, \nbased on the condition that the recipient makes a specified contribution for the same purpose or subproject \n(International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2012. Matching Grants Technical Note. Rome). \n29 Initially selected financial intermediaries (the Bank of India and Samunnati Financial Intermediation and Services \nPrivate Limited) were cleared by ADB\u2019s financial and integrity due diligence. The eligibility criteria and continued \ncompliance requirements for participating financial intermediaries include financial soundness, credit and risk \nmanagement policies, and compliance with prudential regulations as described in Appendix 2 of the Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The financial intermediaries have \nstrong client bases in Maharashtra\u2019s horticulture FPOs and VCOs to deliver effective subprojects with sound \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  arrangements.  The  government  will  relend  to  the  financial \nintermediaries under on lending agreements to be entered into between the Maharashtra Agribusiness Network \n(MAGNET) Society and financial intermediaries with terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n30 The eligibility criteria are listed in Appendix 3 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n31 Gender-responsive design assures a safe work environment for women, including separate toilets and quarters, and \ndesign responsive to people with a disability includes features such as ramps and accessible toilets. \n ", "6 \n \n16.  Lessons incorporated. ADB has conducted a prefeasibility study and two TA projects to \naddress lessons learned and carefully design the project through close collaboration with the \ngovernment.32 The target crops were identified based on the state\u2019s production values, market \ndemand, and growth potential.33 Suitable infrastructure design, FPO capacity gaps, and post-\nharvest handling solutions were studied in a regional TA project, and the project design was \nfinalized through a transaction TA project. The project takes a comprehensive approach to better \nleverage investments from and partnerships with the private sector by supporting viable business \ncase building for vertical integration in horticulture value chains.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s approach. ADB\u2019s approach is to help demonstrate exemplary rural and agricultural \ntransformation through several mutually complementing and interlinking projects in Maharashtra, \nand replicate this to other states once demonstrated.  As part of its efforts to sustain and \nstrengthen ongoing agricultural transformation in Maharashtra, ADB is currently supporting rural \nconnectivity improvement projects, especially in remote and poor areas of the state.34 The project \nand its beneficiaries will take advantage of the improved trunk and feeder road networks provided \nthrough the rural and state road projects.35 ADB\u2019s rural energy distribution project will target this \nproject\u2019s beneficiaries in piloting the concept of \u201cminimum energy support to maximize incomes \nsustainably\u201d to address sustainable power supply and its efficient use for water pumps and other \nuses.36 ADB also supports sustainable shoreline management along the state\u2019s coastline facing \nsalinization and erosion, where some target FPOs of this project are based.37 \n \n18.  The project was processed through One ADB collaboration between the regional and \nprivate sector operation departments. It will complement ADB\u2019s private sector pipeline projects \nfor developing high efficiency crop nutrition and improving soil and water pollution. The project \nwill also diversify the state\u2019s crop varieties and enhance resilience to a changing climate. It will \nalso include safe water and sanitation facilities for handwashing and toilets. Rainwater harvesting \nsystems increase the climate adaptability of the project during dry periods. To collect and store \nrainwater, harvesting systems will be installed in all facilities in the drought-prone regions of the \nstate. This climate adaptation measure is estimated to collectively harvest 21,000 cubic meters \nof rainwater annually for the operations of the MSAMB's facilities. \n \n19.  Delivery and replication of innovative elements. Following the above approach in \nparas 17\u201318, the project will comprehensively address capacity, financial, and infrastructure \nbottlenecks to boost small and marginal farmers\u2019 incomes and welfare and reduce food losses. \nADB will enhance its value addition through the project and attached TA in the following areas: (i) \napplying  innovative  technologies;  (ii)  creating  centers  of  excellence  networks  for  target \nhorticulture crops comprising the NIPHT, associated research centers, and anchor FPOs on good \n \n32 ADB. 2015.

The state of Maharashtra, acting through the MAGNET Society, will be the executing \nagency. The MAGNET Society was established on 3 November 2020 as a special purpose vehicle \nfor the project based on a government resolution.42 A project management unit has been \nestablished in the MAGNET Society. Project implementation units have been established in the \nMSAMB\u2019s eight regional offices and two financial intermediaries.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n27.  ADB will provide transaction TA for Enhancing Market Linkages for Farmer Producer \nOrganizations.43 The TA will support the delivery of the project\u2019s complex and innovative elements \nand address poverty reduction as described in para. 189. The TA will also assess gaps to meet \nsafety and quality requirements of domestic and international markets and provide mechanisms \nand instruments to make value chains more effective. The TA project\u2019s outputs will be (i) crop-\nbased  center  of  excellence  networks  created  and  capacity  development  on  value  chain \nacceleration conducted, (ii) high-level and innovative technologies in agribusiness and agriculture \nvalue chains promoted, (iii) capacity development on post-harvest handling and management \nconducted, and (iv) asset management and financial management capacities of the MAGNET \nSociety and MSAMB improved. ADB will recruit a consulting firm and individual consultants in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) to carry out \nthe TA activities. The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $2.0 \nmillion will be financed on a grant basis by the JFPR and administered by ADB.

Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.45 The principal benefits are (i) a reduction in post-harvest losses as systems for the \nmovement and storage of goods are progressively upgraded; (ii) on-farm improvements in \nproductivity resulting in increased yields and incomes; (iii) increased volume of processing and \ntrading,  resulting  in  increased  value  added,  employment,  and  higher  domestic  supply;  (iv) \nimproved quality of produce; and (v) health benefits through improved hygiene and food safety. \nThe  quantitative  analysis  focuses  on  the  reduction  in  post-harvest  losses  because  of  the \ninvestments in FPO practices and post-harvest facilities. The economic analysis indicated that \nthe project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 16.5%.46 Sensitivity \nanalysis indicated robustness of the economic viability. The analysis includes full recurrent \nexpenditure to ensure sustained operations over the analysis period. \n \n30.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis was conducted in accordance with the ADB \nguidelines.47 The financial intermediaries were assessed as financially sound. As part of the \nsubloans and matching grants to FPOs and VCOs, financial viability and sustainability will be \nincluded as subproject selection criteria. The MSAMB facilities to be improved and developed are \nexpected to increase the MSAMB\u2019s recurrent costs for operating and maintaining its network of \nfacilities. However, based on the MSAMB\u2019s past performance and given its user fee and facility \nleasing policy, the income generated from the facilities is projected to exceed the recurrent costs \nthroughout the economic life of the assets. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  The project\u2019s benefits will be sustained over the long term through various measures. The \nfinancial intermediaries will continue to comply with domestic regulations and ADB\u2019s financial \ncovenants. FPOs and VCOs will be required to demonstrate their ability to cover the operation \nand maintenance costs of the subprojects in order to qualify for a subloan or matching grant. The \nMSAMB\u2019s charges applied to its facilities and its leasing practices are assessed as adequate to \nensure proper maintenance. In addition, the judicious use of beneficiaries\u2019 matching contributions \nunder the matching grant scheme will stimulate the mobilization of private resources as project \ncontributions reduce the investment risks and promote sustainability. The MSAMB is in the \nprocess  of  developing  a  formal  asset  maintenance  policy  targeted  at  improving  its  asset \nmanagement practices and the sustainability of its facility network. ADB will also support the \nMSAMB to further strengthen its facility management and maintenance practices and systems. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n \n44 Extensive analysis of accessible markets, horticultural value chains, and local post-harvest conditions as well as \nstakeholder consultations were carried out to assess the existing conditions and identify the attainable targets and \nrequired interventions during the mapping study, the post-harvest study, and the project processing. \n45 ADB. 2017.

A financial management assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \n(footnote 47). The premitigation financial management risk is substantial mainly because of (i) the \ncomplex project financial management arrangements involving several implementing agencies; \n(ii) the financial management systems of the MAGNET Society, which have still not been fully set \nup;  (iii)  the  implementing  agencies\u2019  lack  of  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  financial  management \nrequirements;  and  (iv)  some  vacant  accounting  and  finance  positions.  These  risks  will  be \nmitigated by (i) setting up robust financial management arrangements, (ii) documenting the \ndetailed financial management arrangements in the PAM and project financial management \nmanual, (iii) filling the vacant positions and engaging an expert to support the project management \nunit, (iv) providing continuous training in ADB\u2019s financial management requirements, (v) including \ncomprehensive financial information in the quarterly project progress reports, and (vi) engaging \nan external firm to conduct internal audits of the project. The project financial statements will be \naudited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following auditing standards acceptable to \nADB. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the national government and the state government. ADB conducted integrity due diligence \non the MAGNET Society and financial intermediaries, and their management and shareholders. \nFor one of the financial intermediaries, weaknesses in its anti-money-laundering program and \ninternal  control  system  and  procedures  were  identified.  Such  integrity  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are included in Table 4. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  In rural Maharashtra, the share of poor is approximately 48.8%, more than double the \nshare in urban areas (20.4%). The eastern region has the highest share of rural poor at 73.0%, \nfollowed by the inland northern region at 66.7%. Importantly, across all regions, the share of rural \npoor is considerably higher than urban poor, highlighting the need for interventions to reduce rural \npoverty (footnote 6). Maharashtra has nearly 20 million poor people and the poverty rate is as \nhigh as 40% in poor districts. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed 78 million additional people below \nthe $1.9 per day international poverty line in developing Asia in 2020, pejoratively in South Asia.48 \nIn  the  past  farmers  have  experienced  40%  post-harvest  crop  losses  because  of  lack  of \nconnectivity to markets, and this worsened in lockdown.49 The project will benefit farmers, the \nrural population, agribusinesses, consumers, and service suppliers in the horticulture value chain. \nThe project will have an overall impact on poverty reduction and address a broad span of poverty \nand  gender  issues.  Access  to  finance  will  increase  economic  opportunities  and  mitigate \nvulnerability of the rural population. The infrastructure development component will provide job \nopportunities, especially during the farming off-season. Vulnerable groups, particularly women, \nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and the poor, will be targeted through the GESI action \nplan (footnote 38). \n \n35.  Gender (category effective gender mainstreaming). There is a direct link between \ngender equality, poverty alleviation, food security, and inclusive growth.\u202fWomen are estimated to \ncarry out 60%\u201375% of farming work but are often\u202fdenied access to knowledge, assets, and \nmarkets.

Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows.50 The  project\u2019s  loan  component  follows  the  general  safeguard \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, while the investment of funds through FILs \nand matching grants will use a tailored approach to address safeguard impacts and risks. The \nexecuting agency will submit semiannual environmental and social monitoring reports. \n \n37.  Environment (category B and FI). The environmental risks and impacts because of the \ninfrastructure development are only site specific and temporary, and an initial environmental \nexamination was prepared.51 Due diligence and review for an irradiation facility under output 3 \nwas performed and the activity was found to be compliant with the prohibited investment activities \nlist of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.52 Financial support for FPOs and VCOs will only apply \nto subprojects that are category B or C. This will be ensured through environmental and social \nmanagement system arrangements with the MAGNET Society for matching grants and with \nfinancial intermediaries for FILs.53 \n \n38.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C  and  FI-C).  The  project\u2019s  infrastructure \ndevelopment will not result in physical or economic displacement, as confirmed by the social \nsafeguard due diligence report. The three new post-harvest facilities will be constructed on \ngovernment land free of encumbrances.54 For the FIL component, only subprojects not requiring \nany involuntary resettlement will be financed. All subprojects under FILs and matching grants will \nbe screened, implemented, and monitored based on the selection criteria and ensured through \nenvironmental and social management system arrangements. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category B and FI). About 15% of Maharashtra\u2019s rural population \nare indigenous peoples, and the majority are part of mainstream society.55 The capacity building \nand financial support will positively impact FPOs that have indigenous peoples as members. Prior \nto conducting the trainings and providing financial support, consultations will be carried out in a \nculturally sensitive manner to ensure that genuine suggestions and concerns of the potential \nbeneficiary indigenous peoples communities are incorporated in the design and implementation \nof training and subprojects. An indigenous people\u2019s plan is not prepared as the positive benefits \nare incorporated in the project design and GESI action plan, including prioritization targets for \nvulnerable groups.56 Financial support for FPOs and VCOs will only apply to subprojects that are \ncategory B or C. \n \n50 ADB.
