The \nproject will also develop and introduce a cashless accident victim treatment facility in the state, \nand improve the accident response system. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nState  context.  The  present  boundaries  of  the  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  were \nreconstituted in November 2000 after its division to create the state of Chhattisgarh. It is still the \nsecond-largest  state  in  the  country,  with  an  area  of  about  308,000  square  kilometers  and  a \npopulation of about 73 million.3 Madhya Pradesh is among the poorer states in the country with \nper  capita  income  at  about  70%  of  the  national  average.4 However,  its  gross  state  domestic \nproduct  grew  at  a  compound  annual  rate  of  about  8.4%  during  FY2005\u2013FY2015.  The  gross \nstate domestic product per capita increased at an average annual rate of 6.9% during the same \nperiod, fostered by a series of developments. These include the Pithampur\u2013Dhar\u2013Mhow region \nas  a key  node  on  the  Delhi\u2013Mumbai  Industrial  Corridor,  as  well  as  many  industrial  areas  and \nindustrial  growth  centers.  However,  agriculture  still  underpins  the  state's  economy  and  about \n70%  of  the  people  live  in  rural  areas.  Because  industrial  development  and  agricultural \nproduction are dispersed, the road network is a vital element of the economic infrastructure.  \n \n4. \nRoad  network.  The  state  has  a  road  network  of  about  127,000  km,  of  which  about \n4,700  km  are  national  highways,  11,000  km  are  state  highways,  and  20,000  km  are  MDRs. \nRural  roads  make  up  the  balance  of  the  road  network.  The  number  of  annually  registered \nvehicles in the state has increased at an average annual rate of 9.7% since 2003 to reach about \n8.8 million in 2013.5 The Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) estimated \nthat  annual  vehicular  growth  in  2011\u20132021  will  exceed  7%.6 Average  daily  traffic  has  been \nincreasing commensurately  with vehicle ownership. The government estimated that more than \n$1.2 billion will be needed in 2013\u20132023 to meet the state\u2019s investment requirements for roads.7 \n \n5. \nRoad  development  program. The state is close to completing its program to upgrade \nthe  entire  state  highway  network  through  a  combination  of  budgetary  allocations,  Asian \nloans,  and  public\u2013private \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  support \n\nthree  previous \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  MDRs form the third tier of the state road network, after national highways and state highways. \n3  Government of India. 2011.

The  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  made  improvements  of \nMDRs  an  essential  part  of  upgrading  the  state  road  core  network,  which  is  being  carried  out \nthrough  the  proposed  plan  in  Table  1.

Madhya Pradesh has a high incidence of poverty and needs substantial \ninvestments to meet its developmental needs. MDRs are a key link in the road network between \nrural  roads  and  the  state  highways.  Continued  development  of  this  network  will  foster \ninclusiveness  by  giving  more  of  the  state\u2019s  population  easier  access  to  markets  and  basic \nservices.  ADB  has  assisted  the  state  government  with  three  previous  loans  to  improve  state \nhighways and one loan for MDRs, and ADB\u2019s loans to the central line ministry have also been \nused for rural roads in the state.10 ADB\u2019s assistance to the state\u2019s road sector has provided an \nopportunity  for  ADB  to  build  institutional  capacity  of  MPRDC,  as  well  as  to  participate  in,  and \nsubstantially  complete,  the  development  of  all  tiers  of  the  state  road  network.  Through  this \nproject, ADB will help complete the state-wide road improvement program, stabilize and deepen \ninstitutional capacity, and improve road safety and accident response initiatives. The project is \nconsistent  with  the  strategic  objectives  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India  to \ndevelop  the  state  core  road  network,  focus  on  lagging  states,  and  (in  the  transport  sector) \nincrease the movement of people and goods.11 The project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018, for India.12 \n \nModality. Sector lending13 is well suited for this project because (i) the project covers a \n7. \nnumber  of  MDRs  distributed  across  the  state;  (ii)  Madhya  Pradesh  has  a  sector  development \n\n                                                \n8 ADB. 2002.

MPRDC, set up under \nan ADB technical assistance project (footnote 8), is crucial to this capacity. Incorporated in 2004, \nMPRDC was designated as a highway authority under the state\u2019s highway legislation to develop \nstate highways, MDRs, and other infrastructure. The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh is chair \nof  the  MPRDC  board;  the  minister  for  the  state\u2019s  Public  Works  Department  and  the  chief \nsecretary  of  the  state  are  the  vice-chairs.  MPRDC  has  developed  a  strong  managerial  and \ntechnical  team  headed  by  its  managing  director,  who  is  a  senior  officer  of  the  government. \nMPRDC  has  substantive  project  implementation  experience  from  previous  ADB  loans.  Under \nthe  sector  loan,  the  approval  of  non-sample  road  subprojects  will  be  based  on  satisfactory \ntechnical, economic, social, and environmental assessments.14 MPRDC and ADB will agree on \nthe eligibility criteria, which will be based on the respective criteria set out for the sample roads. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  mobility  and  accessibility,  which  is  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan.15 The outcome will be improved road transport efficiency \nand safety in Madhya Pradesh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \n\nThe project outputs will be the following: \n(i) \n\nMajor  district  roads  reconstructed  and  rehabilitated. About 1,400\u20131,500 km \nof  MDRs,  designed \nto  all-weather  standards  and  road  safety,  will  be \nreconstructed  and  rehabilitated.  The  roads  will  be  constructed  with  concrete \npavements  which  will  improve  asset  life  and  maintainability.  The  construction \ncontracts will include 5-year, performance-based maintenance obligations, which \nwill  also  improve  the  quality  of  assets  created  as  the  contractors  will  need  to \nkeep in view the extended risk liability.  \nCashless accident victim treatment facility implemented. The facility will be a \ngroup  insurance  product  that  enables  the  treatment  of  road  accident  victims  in \nproximate hospitals. This facility will be available in nonurban areas, initially in 3\u2013\n4 districts of the state, with insurance premiums being paid using ADB financing. \nAccident response system improved. Hardware and networking improvements \nto  the  existing  accident  response  system  will  be  upgraded  to  increase  the \ncapacity  and  reach  of  the  system,  and  enhance  interfacing  with  other  services. \nWhile  Madhya  Pradesh  was  one  of  the  first  states  in  India  to  establish  such  a \nsystem  and  provide  links  to  ambulances  throughout  the  state,  the  current \ninitiative will mainstream these systems. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \nfinancier and by year are in the project administration manual (PAM).16 \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $500  million  (Table  2).

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The \ngovernment  has  requested  the straight-line repayment  option.  Based  on these  loan terms  and \nthis  repayment  option,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.25  years  and  the  maturity  premium \npayable to ADB is 0.10% per year.17 \n \n12. \nState Government of Madhya Pradesh has allocated counterpart financing for 30% of the cost. \n \n\nThe financing plan is in Table 3.

Based  on  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  of  civil  works  in  December \n2015, the Government of India requested retroactive financing for all project components. Up to \n20%  of  the  amount  of  the  loan  proceeds  ($70 million)  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing, \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  for  the \nproject  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  These \nexpenditures  should  follow  agreed  procedures,  including  ADB  approval  of  contract-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  The  Government  of  India,  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh, and MPRDC have been informed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nThe project was prepared with the enhanced capacity MPRDC gained through the four \n16. \nprevious  ADB  loans  and  technical  assistance  (footnotes  8  and  9).  MPRDC\u2019s  consultants \nprepared  detailed  design  documents  for  the  roads  proposed  for  ADB  financing,  incorporating \nADB requirements of economic, social, and environmental studies into the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference.  ADB  engaged  individual  consultants  to  conduct  an  economic  assessment  and  due \ndiligence on environmental and social safeguards to ensure that the consultants\u2019 work complies \nwith  ADB  requirements.  The  engineering  design  was  prepared  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fminimize  social  and  environmental  impacts,  incorporate  road  safety,  and  mitigate  climate \nchange risks. In addition, advance actions were taken to ensure that construction can start early. \nThese measures to improve project readiness will facilitate faster project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nThe economic evaluation of the project followed the standard practice of comparing life \ncycle costs  with and without the  project,  using the  net  present  value  with a  12%  discount rate \nand the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria. The economic analysis was \nconducted with the highway development model 4, which estimates road agency costs and road \nuser  costs  to  assess  the  economic  viability  of  project  roads  using  input  data  on  traffic,  road \ngeometry,  pavement  structure,  condition  and  material  characteristics  of  the  existing  road, \nmaintenance and road improvement costs, and vehicle operating costs. The value added from \nimproved  transport  links,  resulting  in  new  industries  and  employment,  are  captured  through \nbenefits from generated traffic. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  nine  sample  MDRs  totaling  238  km.  The \n18. \nEIRR  for  the  nine  project  roads  averaged  17.3%,  ranging  from  13.0%  for  the  Harfari\u2013Khaira\u2013\nMisirgawan  Road  to  23.5%  for  the  Dharna\u2013Asta\u2013Dondiwada\u2013Dharmakua  Road.  Overall, \nsample roads have an EIRR that satisfies the economic viability criteria of 12%. The sensitivity \nof the EIRR for the sample project roads together was analyzed with respect to changes in the \nbenefit and cost streams. The following sensitivity cases were examined: (i) construction costs \nincreased  by  10%,  (ii)  vehicle  operating  cost  and  travel  time  savings  reduced  by  10%, \n(iii) construction  costs  increased  by  10%  and  vehicle  operating  cost  and  travel  time  savings \nreduced by 10%, (iv) a 2-year delay in road construction, (v) road maintenance costs increased \nby 100% in the project case, and (vi) value of time decreased by 20%. The results highlight the \nrobust economic viability of the sample roads in all sensitivity tests. All selected roads have an \nEIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests, except for the Harfari\u2013Khaira\u2013Misirgawan Road under \nscenario  (iii)  for  which  the  EIRR  is  11.3%.  The  traffic  growth  rate  in  rural  Madhya  Pradesh  is \nlikely to significantly exceed the normal traffic growth scenario considered because of generated \ntraffic  and  conservative  growth  assumptions.  In  addition  to  quantified  benefits  of  maintenance \nsavings, vehicle operating costs savings, and time savings, the project road improvements will \nalso accelerate the economic growth of the rural areas of the state, which otherwise suffer from \npoor  connectivity.  The  population  connected  through  project  roads  will  benefit  from  easier \naccess to social, health, and education facilities.18 \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  state  Public  Works  Department's  budget  allocation  for \n19. \nmaintenance doubled from FY2010 to FY2015, and is expected to grow in line with the state's \ngross  domestic  product.  Current  allocations  for  maintenance  cover  about  80%  of  the \nrequirements,  including  the  project  incremental  recurrent  costs.  The  State  Road  Development \nPlan  has  introduced  measures  to  improve  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  road  network. \nMPRDC is separately piloting an operate\u2013maintain\u2013transfer system, with a concession period of \n7\u201310  years, to  provide  some  toll  revenue  to  support road maintenance. For  the  project  roads, \nthe  use  of  concrete  pavements  and  inclusion  of  maintenance  element  for  5  years  from \ncompletion of construction will improve asset construction quality as well as maintenance. \n \n\n                                                \n18 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  executing  agency,  MPRDC,  is  wholly  owned  by  the  State \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh.  Its  board  includes  the  highest  levels  of  political  and \nadministrative officers in the state. MPRDC has been the implementing agency for four previous \nADB loans and is familiar with ADB procedures and has strong institutional capacity. In addition \nto  its  headquarters  in  Bhopal,  MPRDC  has  many  divisional  offices  across  the  state  and  also \nmanages many public\u2013private partnership projects. \n  \n21. \nFinancial  management.  An  assessment  of  MPRDC\u2019s  accounting  systems,  financial \nreporting, and external audit procedures, has concluded that MPRDC has adequate capacity in \nproject  financial  accounting  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures  because  of  its  significant \nexperience with ADB-funded  projects.  MPRDC follows  double-entry,  accrual-based  accounting \nand  prepares  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  standards  of  India. \nMPRDC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  by  funding  source  for  all \nexpenditures  incurred  on  the  project.  Project  accounts  will  follow  accounting  principles  and \npractices  prescribed  by  the  accounting  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  of  India.  An \ninternal  audit  is  carried  out  by  a  firm  of  chartered  accountants  appointed  by  MPRDC.  An \nexternal audit is conducted by independent auditors from the panel appointed by the comptroller \nand auditor general in accordance with auditing standards issued by the  Government of India. \nThe overall financial management risk is assessed as low.19 \n \n22. \nProcurement.  MPRDC  has  extensive  experience  in  procurement  and  consultant \nrecruitment for ADB projects, as well as in the use of various forms of public\u2013private partnership \nfor  road  projects.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using quality- and \ncost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20  as  agreed  with  the  Government. \nProcurement  actions  for  18  works  contracts  packages  are  already  ongoing;  the  remaining \npackages  will  be  bid  out  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016.  Recruitment  of  the  supervision \nconsultants  for  the  three  construction  supervision  consultant  packages  has  begun  and \nshortlisting was completed as part of advance action. The procurement plan for the project is in \nthe PAM.20 \n \n23. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Government of India and MPRDC.  Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24.  Madhya Pradesh is one of the less developed states with a human development index of \n0.375, which is below the national average.21 Agriculture is the main sector in the local economy. \nA  social  impact  assessment  involving  1,926  households found  that  poor  road conditions  were \npreventing safe and reliable travel, especially during the rainy season. Better roads will increase \nnew  economic  and  job  opportunities  by  improving  links  to  commercial  facilities.

India Human Development Report (Towards Social Inclusion).  \n\nDelhi. Comparative data for 2008 for India is 0.467. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\ncommunities will benefit by having faster and more reliable transport of their produce to markets \nand  by  receiving  higher  profit  margins.  Access  to  public  and  social  service  facilities  (such  as \ngovernment agencies, health centers, and schools) will also be enhanced. Project beneficiaries \ninclude local residents, road users, businesses, commercial services, and government workers. \nThe  project  roads  cover  19  districts  in  the  state  where  about  30.1  million  people  live.  The \nbidding  documents  include  provisions  for  the  civil  works  contracts  to  comply  with  core  labor \nstandards. Details are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.22  \n \n25.  Gender. During the social study, 21 focus group discussions were held with women only. \nThe  discussions  revealed  that  women  are  not  actively  engaged  in  family  and  community \ndecision-making  processes.  Women  indicated  that  poor  road  conditions  were  preventing  safe \nand  reliable  travel.  Improved  road  conditions  are  expected  to  provide  better  access  to  health \nservices, higher levels of education, and social interactions, as well as better public and private \ntransport options. Gender-sensitive features include (i) integrating safety and other features for \nthe elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design, such as well-marked \ncrossings,  raised  pedestrian  walkways,  hard  shoulders,  soft  shoulders,  or  covered  drains \ndepending  on the  available right-of-way  and local  needs;  (ii) giving  preference to  local  women \nand  vulnerable  households  for  road  maintenance  jobs  during  the  5-year  maintenance  period, \nwhich  is  estimated  to  generate  about  136  person-years  of  employment,  and  ensuring  that \nprovisions  for  equal  wages  for  equal  work  by  male  and  female  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  in \nproject  works  are in the bidding  documents; (iii)  providing  training to  all  maintenance workers; \n(iv)  collecting  sex-disaggregated  data  and  pedestrian  data  for  the  cashless  accident  victim \ntreatment  facility  being  developed;  and  (v)  collecting  sex-disaggregated  data  and  improving \npublic awareness targeting rural communities for the accident response system. \n \n26. \nHIV/AIDS. Adult HIV prevalence in India was 0.27% in 2011. New infections declined by \n57%  from  2000  to  2011,  and  AIDS-related  deaths  dropped  by  29%  from  2007  to  2011. 23 \nAccording to India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex workers, drug \nusers,  migrant  laborers,  and truck  drivers).  Madhya  Pradesh  is  a  low-prevalence  state.  Based \non  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  the  project  will  not  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence  as  all \nimproved  roads  will  be  along  the  existing  corridor.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS \nawareness for laborers at work sites, monitored by the CSCs.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental  impact. The project is categorized B for the environment, according to \n27. \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  scope  of  work  under  the  sample  subprojects \ninvolves improvement  and maintenance of  existing  MDRs.  Adequate rights-of-way  is  available \nfor  all  the  sample  subprojects,  and  no  significant,  long-term,  or  irreversible  environmental \nimpacts  are  expected.  A  consolidated  initial  environmental  examination  report,  with  contract \npackage-specific  EMPs,  has  been  prepared  for  the  nine  sample  subprojects  and  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website. For the sector project, an environmental assessment and review \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  compliance  with  environment  safeguard  requirements \nunder the acts and policies of the Government of India and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nNo category A subprojects will be financed under the project. Anticipated environmental impacts \nduring construction of the sample subprojects entail typical issues related to road construction, \n\n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare.  2011.

During \n\nimplementation,  each  of \n\nsuch  as generation of  dust,  noise,  exhaust,  waste from  construction  and  worker camps,  water \ncontamination,  occupational  health  and  safety,  erosion,  and  siltation.  Potential  operational \nimpacts such as noise, pollution, and safety issues caused by increased traffic are expected to \nbe insignificant. Mitigation measures to address all construction- and operation-related impacts \nhave  been  included  in  the  contract  package-specific  EMPs.  The  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the \nbidding documents and be mandatory for implementation by the contractor. Consultations have \nbeen  conducted  with  stakeholders  and  affected  persons,  during  the  project  preparation  stage, \nand their concerns have been incorporated in the initial environmental examination and EMP. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and \ncomplaints, if any, from affected parties and addressing them during construction and operation. \n \nOne environment safeguards officer will be assigned at the MPRDC and another one will \n28. \nthe  10  project \nbe  recruited \nimplementation  units  of  MPRDC  will  have  an  environment  safeguard  focal  person.  During \ninception and preconstruction, ADB and the CSC will conduct initial workshops for MPRDC staff, \nother CSC staff, and the contractors. Additional training will be conducted during construction as \nnecessary.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  resettlement,  according  to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project uses the most feasible technical design to avoid \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Roads will be improved within the existing right-of-\nway. The sample subprojects are representative of the kinds of impact likely to be encountered \nin non-sample roads. Stakeholders and affected persons were consulted during preparation of \nthe  sample  subprojects,  and  project  information  was  disclosed.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been \nprepared  for  the  nine  households  that  will  experience  temporary  impacts  to  their  livelihoods, \nduring  construction,  on  three  of  the  sample  subprojects.  A  due  diligence  report  has  been \nprepared for the remaining six sample subprojects to verify that there will be no impact. For the \nsector  project,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  acts  and \npolicies of the Government of India and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The framework will \nguide  the  screening  and  planning  for  all  subsequent  subprojects.  Displaced  persons  will  be \ncompensated at replacement cost (rates for different categories of loss and special assistance \nare in the framework). If any changes, additional land requirements, or involuntary resettlement \nimpacts  are  identified  during  implementation,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  or  updated. \nADB\u2019s prior approval will be obtained before further implementation of the relevant section of the \nsubproject.  MPRDC  has  implemented  five  ADB  projects  since  2002  (footnotes  8  and  9).  One \ndedicated staff in MPRDC will oversee the project; each of MPRDC\u2019s 10 project implementation \nunits will have a social safeguard focal person. During inception and preconstruction, ADB and \nthe  CSC  will  conduct  initial  workshops for  MPRDC  staff,  other  CSC  staff,  and the contractors. \nAdditional training will be conducted during the construction stage as necessary. \n \nIndigenous  people.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  people,  according  to \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement.  Madhya Pradesh  has a significant  tribal  population,  which \nconstitutes  more  than  one-fifth  of  its  total  population.  The  state  is  home  to  46  \u201cscheduled \ntribes.\u201d24 The tribal population is largely concentrated in and around the forest area. All project \nroads will  be  improved  within the  existing  alignment  and  no  new  roads  are  being  constructed. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  survey  confirmed  that  the  socioeconomic  impacts  will  not \ndiffer  between  tribal  groups  and  nontribal  groups.  No  category  A  subprojects  will  be  financed \n\n                                                \n24 Tribes or tribal communities recognized under the Constitution of India through applicable legislation. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\funder  the  project.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide \nscreening of the impact of non-sample subprojects. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 The assessment indicates that the overall \nrisk  is  low  considering  the  mitigation  measures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nproject \nimplementation \n\nInadequate \nquality checking \nand monitoring \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nMPRDC  has  prepared  the  detailed  design  for  the  nine  sample  roads  and  has  completed \nsafeguard-related  surveys  and  reviews.  Detailed  project  reports  for  the  non-sample  roads  were \ncompleted by August 2016. For sample roads, consultant recruitment for construction supervision \nis in progress. Procurement for works contracts started in June 2016. Project designs have been \nprepared to avoid land acquisition. However, because of the large number of non-sample roads, \nthe risk after mitigation is still medium. \nEngineers  and  construction  supervision  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  quality  checks  in \naccordance  with  contracts.  ADB  will  undertake  frequent  review  missions  to  ensure  timely \nundertaking  and  implementing  quality  of  contracts.  Ten  project  implementation  units  are \nenvisaged,  distributed  around  the  state  near  work  sites.  These  units  will  be  supported  by  three \nfirms  of  construction  supervision  consultants.  The  introduction  of  5-year,  performance-based \nmaintenance  in  works  contracts  will  increase  contractor  accountability  for  construction  quality. \nDespite these steps, quality control and checking will be best addressed by field staff. This is the \nfirst time that concrete pavements are being used on this scale on district roads. As the roads are \ndispersed geographically throughout the state, the level of risk after mitigation is still medium. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPRDC = Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n32. \nThe Government of India, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, and MPRDC have \nassured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies \nincluding \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement, \nconsulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \nThe  national  and  state  governments  and  the  MPRDC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$350,000,000  to  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  District  Roads  II  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending facility; for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n5 September 2016 \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project Is aligned with: \nMobility and accessibility improved (Twelfth Five Year Plan)a \n\nResults Chain \n\nOutcome \n\nRoad transport \nefficiency and safety \nin Madhya Pradesh \nimproved \n\nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nRisks \n\na-c.
