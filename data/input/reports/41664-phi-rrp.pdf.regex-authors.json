Category of subprojects financed through the financial \nintermediary will be limited to B or C.  \n   \nProject Description  To help achieve health-related MDGs of the Philippines, the Project \nwill address low and inefficient public expenditures in health care by \nmobilizing additional off-budget credit for pro-poor investment through \na government financial intermediary, leveraging private participation, \nand improving allocation toward investment priorities. These priorities \ninclude  (i)  maternal  and  child  health  services,  (ii)  control  of \ncommunicable  diseases,  (iii) services  to  improve  access  to  basic \nhealth care, and (iv) referral services including laboratory and other \ndiagnostic services.   \n \nThe Project will support DBP\u2019s Sustainable Health Care Investment \nProgram, a credit facility established in 2007 to support the health \nsector  reform  agenda  and  implementation  framework\u2014Fourmula \nOne for Health (F1)\u2014of the Department of Health (DOH). The credit \nfacility is available to local government units (LGUs), and the private \nsector through two windows (i) direct retail lending for LGUs and \nlarger  private  sector  subborrowers,  and  (ii)  wholesale  lending  to \naccredited financial intermediaries (microfinance intermediaries, rural \nand  thrift  banks)  for  small  private  subborrowers.  The  Investment \nProgram is financed from DBP\u2019s own resources and supplementary \nfunds  of  development  partners,  and  supports  both  capital \ninvestments and working capital. \n \nThe Project\u2019s outputs are (i) upgraded LGU health services, (ii) more \nefficient  health  delivery  systems  through  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP) and innovative strategies, (iii) improved access to small-scale \nprivate providers, and (iv) enhanced institutional capacity for health \nsector lending. \n   \nRationale  The Government of the Philippines (the Government) is committed to \nmeeting the country's MDGs. The Philippines MDG Report for 2007 \nhighlights the mixed achievements, and especially the slow progress \nin  reducing  maternal  mortality,  and  the  need  for  better  health \nservices.   \n ", "ii   \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  the  Government\u2019s \nplans  for  mobilizing  off-budget  resources  through  government \nfinancial institutions, the private sector, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and civil society.  \n \nADB\u2019s Health Sector Development Program (2004\u20132010) supported \nkey policy reforms and implementation of DOH\u2019s F1 for health. The \nProject is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 (involving MDGs, PPP, \npublic expenditure management) and will enable ADB to continue \npolicy dialogue on health sector development. \n \nThe Project will address a key bottleneck in the implementation of \nDOH\u2019s F1 by providing credit to upgrade health facilities. This will not \nonly improve health services, but will trigger higher reimbursement of \nthe  Philippine  Health  Insurance  Corporation  (PHIC)  and  thereby \nreduce  the  cost  of  health  care  for  the  poor,  which  in  turn  will \ncontribute to achieving MDGs.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is improved overall health status, especially \nin relation to MDGs by (i) reduced under-five child mortality rate and \nreduced  infant  mortality  rate  (MDG  4),  and  (ii) reduced  maternal \nmortality ratio (MDG 5). The Project\u2019s outcome is increased use of \nbasic health care and referral services by the poor in general, and by \nwomen and children in particular, in the subproject sites. The Project \nwill be nationwide, with the exception of the National Capital Region. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The project investment cost is estimated at $63.36 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.50 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB\u2019s lending procedures for financial intermediaries will apply. \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  50.00    78.91 \nGender and Development Cooperation Funda  0.40    0.63 \nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines  1.94    3.06 \nEquity (public and private sectors)  11.02    17.40 \n  Total    63.36    100.00 \na  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nDBP  has  requested  a  loan  of  \u00a54,520,780,200  (equivalent  to  $50 \nmillion)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the \nProject. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. The Gender and Development \nCooperation  Fund  will  provide  a  grant  up  to  $400,000  to  be \nadministered by ADB. \n \nAllocation and   DBP is the borrower. The Republic of the Philippines, under the \nRelending Terms  terms  of  a  guarantee  agreement,  will  guarantee  the  loan.  For ", "  iii\nrelending  to  its  subborrowers,  DBP  uses  (i)  retail  lending  and \n(ii) wholesale lending.  \n \nRetail lending is for collateralized subprojects from $100,000 to $5 \nmillion equivalent. DBP\u2019s lending terms are at market interest rates \nand the repayments are based on subprojects\u2019 projected cash flows, \nwith repayment periods of up to 15 years for civil works, up to 10 \nyears for equipment, up to 5 years for working capital, and grace \nperiods of up to 3 years. Amortization of principal and interest is on a \nquarterly basis.  \n \nWholesale lending is for accredited financial intermediaries (including \nmicrofinance institutions, rural and thrift banks, and cooperatives) who \nborrow amounts ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent for \nonlending  under  DBP  lending  terms.  The  terms  of  onlending  by \nfinancial intermediaries depend on the amounts borrowed and whether \nor not the subloans are collateralized. Expected repayment periods is \nup to 10 years, with grace periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years.  \n \nThe first three subloans financed under the loan and any subloans \ncosting more than $2 million equivalent will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval before DBP approves the subloan. For subloans \nbelow or equal to $2 million equivalent, DBP will submit to ADB a \nstatement of subloans describing the subproject, amount applied, \npurpose  of  the  subloan,  eligibility  criteria,  including  terms  and \ncondition.  Loan  review  missions  will  review  selected  subprojects \nduring implementation. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2015  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  DBP \n   \nImplementation  DBP  has  established  the  Health  Sector  Investment  Advisory \nArrangements  Committee  chaired  by  DBP\u2019s  senior  vice-president,  with \nrepresentatives  of  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  the  Municipal  Development \nFund  Office  (MDFO),  the  Department  of  Interior  and  Local \nGovernment (DILG), and the private sector. DBP has entered into an \nagreement  with  DILG,  DOH,  PHIC,  and  MDFO  that  outlines  the \nobjectives, procedures and areas for cooperation, eligibility criteria \nfor  borrowers,  eligible  investment  costs,  DOH  preparation  of \nfeasibility and capacity development, flow of funds, and monitoring \nand evaluation. \n \nDBP  has  set  up  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  under  its \nSustainable  Health  Care  Investment  Program  in  the  Program \nDevelopment  Department.  It  includes  a  project  director,  a  project \nmanager, an assistant project manager, and two project associates as \nDBP staff. The project director will be the officer responsible for overall \nproject execution, finance, monitoring, and reporting to the committee \nand  ADB.  The  project  manager  will  be  responsible  for  project \n ", "iv   \nimplementation. The assistant project manager, assisted by the project \nassociates will run day-to-day PMO operations. The PMO will also \nrecruit  experts  in  health  systems,  hospital  civil  works,  hospital \nenvironment  and  waste  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nfinancial management, and legal matters. Other DBP divisions at the \ncentral  and  regional  levels  will  provide  necessary  support  for  the \neffective implementation of the Project. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services financed under the loan will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Except where stated otherwise in the procurement \nplan, procurement undertaken by beneficiaries under the loan will be \nin accordance with the procedure set out in procurement of loans to \nfinancial intermediaries that allows for procurement in accordance with \nestablished private sector or commercial practices. For other cases \nidentified in the procurement plan, however, national or international \ncompetitive bidding may be the specified form of procurement. The \nprocedures followed for national competitive bidding will be those set \nforth in the Government Procurement Reform Act (Republic Act No. \n9184) with clarifications and modifications in the national competitive \nbidding  annex  of  the  Procurement  Plan.  Civil  works  in  excess  of \n$5,000,000 equivalent and contracts for goods estimated to cost in \nexcess  of  $1,000,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  based  on \ninternational competitive bidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  DBP  will  engage,  administer,  and  finance  84  person-months  of \nnational consulting services in the areas of health systems, social \nmarketing,  and  hospital  environmental  and  medical  waste \nmanagement. The assignment will be implemented over 24 months. \nDBP will also engage and administer 90 person-months of national \nconsulting  services  financed  under  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation  Fund.  These  services  are  to  be  sourced  through  a \nnational health NGO in the areas of community health, training, and \nlegal matters. The NGO will be selected using quality- and cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Health  Benefits.  The  Project  is  designed  to  address  MDGs  by \nBeneficiaries  targeting the poor, in particular women and children with poor health \nindicators.  It  specifically  addresses  gaps  in  basic  health  care, \nincluding  maternal  and  child  health  care,  communicable  disease \ncontrol,  diagnostic  services,  and  referral  services.  The  Project \npromotes  the  use  of  PHIC-accredited  health  facilities,  thereby \npromoting quality standards of services, and supports partnership \nbetween the public and the private sectors to address such gaps in \nhealth care as staff shortages for maternal care.  \n \nSocial, Gender and Poverty Benefits. The Project is designed to \nresult  in  major  social,  gender,  and  poverty  benefits  with  multiple \nimpacts. A larger proportion of the beneficiaries will be the poor, \nwomen, and children. They will benefit from upgrading LGU health ", "  v\nfacilities, and from filling gaps in service delivery through PPP and \nsupport  for  small  providers  close  to  communities.  Oversight \narrangements, capacity building, provincial plans, eligibility criteria, \nand targeted funding for assisting small providers will help to ensure \nsuitable  subprojects  are  selected  that  yield  maximum  benefit  for \nthese  vulnerable  groups.  The  Project  also  supports  PHIC \naccreditation of health providers close to the underserved population. \nFinally,  the  Project  provides  improved  access  to  credit  and \nopportunities for improved earnings for small-scale health providers, \nwho are often female (midwives, drug store owners).  \n \nFinancial  Protection  of  the  Poor. The poor will benefit through \n(i) reduced costs of care and transport; (ii) increased subsidy from \nPHIC-accredited  health  facilities,  including  generic  drug  outlets \noffering lower priced drugs, and indirectly, (iii) through better health \nresulting in less income erosion and increased productivity.  \n \nEconomic Benefits and Financial Sustainability. The Project will \nimprove technical and allocative efficiencies. The economic analysis \nshows  the  Project  will  have  substantial  economic  benefits  from \naverting maternal and child mortality even without including morbidity \nand disability in the analysis. The subprojects are generally considered \nfinancially sustainable, provided revenues are not delayed. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Key  assumptions  for  successful  project  implementation  are \n(i) adequate recurrent and capital budgets by national government \nand LGUs  for health-related programs, (ii) enrollment of indigents \nand the poor into PHIC, (iii) provider access to a comprehensive \nPHIC  benefits  and  reimbursements  package,  and  (iv)  LGUs\u2019  and \nprivate  health  entrepreneurs\u2019  willingness  and  ability  to  borrow  at \nDBP\u2019s (or financial intermediaries\u2019) terms.  \n \nDelayed Mobilization of LGUs. DBP, through its partnership with \nDOH and the Department of Interior and Local Government, will need \nto ensure the timely mobilization of LGUs under F1 and the ensuing \npreparation of the subproject feasibility studies.   \n \nLimited  Experience  in  the  Health  Sector.  DBP  has  limited \nexperience  in  the  health  sector.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  DBP  will \nstrengthen its capacity and partner with other agencies.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  A technical assistance grant of $1,000,000 will be financed by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan for public\u2013\nprivate partnership in health to support LGUs and private providers \nby (i) introducing  innovative public\u2013private partnership strategies to \nimprove  efficiency,  access,  and  quality  of  services;  (ii)  assisting \nsmall-scale  health  providers  to  improve  their  access  to  credit  to \nsupport progress towards health-related MDGs; and (iii) mobilizing \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs.  \n ", "", " ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan; \nand (ii) a proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Gender and Development \nCooperation Fund,1 both to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for the Credit for Better \nHealth Care Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership in Health, and if the Board approves the loan and the grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The Government of the Philippines, with its partners, wants to improve health care for its \npopulation of about 90 million to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and ensure \ntimely and adequate response to the changing morbidity patterns in the Philippines. The country\u2019s \nMDG performance is mixed: the infant mortality rate was reportedly reduced to 24 deaths per 1,000 \nlive births in 2006 and is on track. The malnutrition rate (weight by age) shows little improvement at \n26% but is above the regional average. The maternal mortality ratio has declined to 162 deaths per \n100,000 live births in 2006, and it may not reach MDG targets. Tuberculosis and other communicable \ndiseases remain common, and HIV/AIDS is emerging.2 Health indicators in the Eastern Visayas, \nBicol, and most of Mindanao are particularly lagging. The country\u2019s relatively slow progress in \nhealth is linked to poverty, rapid population growth, and low investment in health. Health services \nfall short in terms of access and affordability for the poor, quality and efficiency of service delivery, \nand financing of services and investment.  \n \n3.  The Philippines has an average per capita income of $1,351, albeit with considerable \ninequity. Economic growth was 7% in 2007 but slowed to 4.6% annually in the first half of 2008. It \nis predicted to slow further to 3%\u20134% in 2009. Reflecting the global slowdown, exports have fallen \nand so has foreign direct investment. Public sector consumption and investment spending have \ncontracted in real terms, and private sector consumption growth is at its lowest since 2001. \nInflation was a high 7% in 2008 and is rising. It particularly affects the poor, given the high food \nprice inflation. The Government has responded by postponing its goal of a balanced budget to \nallow for increased spending in 2008 in infrastructure, social protection, and subsidies.  \n \n4.  The robust economic growth in recent years has apparently had little impact on poverty. \nThe 2006 poverty level of 33%, or 27.6 million, is similar to the 2000 level. Income inflation is not \nkeeping pace with price inflation, especially in recent times. Social safety net programs are limited, \ngiving the poor and near poor little protection. Catastrophic events such as the loss of a job or \nhospitalization result in food shortages among the poor, and cause the near poor to slip into \npoverty. In 1997, a sponsored program for the poor was introduced under the Philippine Health \nInsurance Corporation (PHIC) to offset some health care costs, and in 2007, the Ahon Pamilyang \nPilipino (conditional cash transfer program) was piloted. To improve social protection, the PHIC \naims to achieve universal enrollment of the poor, with budgetary support from central and local \ngovernments, and to provide a comprehensive benefits package for the poor.  \n \n5.  Health sector spending remains low. In 2005, it was 3.3% of gross domestic product or $40 \nper capita. While public expenditures for health have grown in absolute terms, they have not kept \npace with population and inflationary pressures. Health care is financed from multiple sources, \n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "2 \n \nincluding the national budget (16.7%), local government (17.5%), PHIC (9.5%), private insurers, \nand out of pocket (48%). Public health spending as a percentage of total health spending declined \nfrom 41% in 2000 to 29% in 2005, due in particular to declining local government expenditures.  \n \n6.  To help improve health services, the Government is encouraging local government units \n(LGUs) to mobilize off-budget support through government financial intermediaries (GFIs), the \nprivate sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and civil society, with special schemes for \npoorer  LGUs  and  those  unable  to  access  funds  from  the  private  capital  markets.  The \nGovernment\u2019s LGU financing framework (1996) is helping create a credit culture among LGUs to \nimprove their creditworthiness. Its LGU credit policy framework (1996) promotes the involvement of \nGFIs in LGU financing, and it guides GFIs and the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) to \nact as catalysts to bring LGUs into the mainstream of private capital markets. This will open up off-\nbudget financing channels for health investment.  \n \n7.  The Project will support DBP to offer LGUs and the private sector better access to credit to \nhelp  achieve  MDGs,  improve  public  sector  management,  stimulate  public\u2013private  partnership \n(PPP), and improve rural access to health care. The Project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for 2009\u201320103 and is in line with the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).4   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Philippine Health System and Strategy \n \n8.  The Philippines has a dual health care system of largely tax-financed public health services \nat national and local levels plus an extensive for-profit and nonprofit private sector that is largely \nfinanced from user fees. Public health services in the Philippines are provided by the Department \nof Health (DOH), LGUs, and other agencies. LGUs finance and operate provincial and district \nhospitals, and municipal governments run rural health units and barangay health stations.5 The \nprivate health sector includes clinics, hospitals, insurance companies, manufacturers of drugs and \nequipment,  and  training  institutes.6 PHIC  is  a  government-owned  and  controlled  corporation \nattached to DOH, mandated to administer the PHIC program and ensure that Filipinos have \nfinancial access to health services. \n \n9.  The Philippines health system has gone through several reforms, including devolution of \nhealth services to local government units in 1991 and the national health insurance act in 1995 that \nincluded the nonformal sector. In 1999, DOH launched the health sector reform agenda to improve \nthe sector\u2019s delivery, regulation, and financing. In 2005, DOH launched Fourmula One for Health \n(F1)\u2014the reform\u2019s implementation framework for 2005\u20132010. F1 is directed toward achieving \nbetter  health  outcomes,  a  more  responsive  health  system,  and  more  equitable  health  care \nfinancing (especially for the poor). Its four objectives are to (i) secure more, better, and sustained \nfinancing for health care; (ii) assure the quality and affordability of health goods and services; (iii) \nensure access to and availability of essential and basic health care packages; and (iv) improve \nperformance of the health system. F1 is designed to implement critical health interventions as a \nsingle package, backed by effective management infrastructure and financing arrangements. It \nengages the entire health sector, including public and private services, development partners, and \ncivil society, and it is the basis for DOH\u2019s medium-term expenditure framework (2007\u20132010).

Manila.    \n5  Rural health units serve a catchment population of about 40,000 people, and barangay health stations about 5,000 \npeople. A barangay is the country\u2019s smallest administrative division and corresponds to the village level. \n6  The number of LGU hospitals has increased to about 700, compared to about 1,100 private hospitals.     ", "    3 \ncoordinates  all  sector  activities,  including  aid  harmonization  through  the  sector  development \napproach for health (SDAH).7 ADB supports F1 through SDAH and participates in DOH\u2019s joint \nassessment and planning initiative with other development partners.   \n \n10.  A key feature of F1 is to engage PHIC as the main lever to effect each of the four reform \nareas under a single national implementation plan and under single local health investment plans \nin the first batch of 16 provinces. DOH wants to scale up the reforms and build ownership in all \nprovinces by 2010. The sector needs, however, to address multiple challenges, including (i) limited \naccess to and affordability of health care for the poor, (ii) inadequate quality and inefficiency of service \ndelivery, (iii) lack of delivery standards and accountability mechanisms, and (iv) limited financing and \naccess to credit for operating services properly and investing in buildings and equipment. All of these \nneed to be addressed under F1 to achieve the MDGs and adjust to the changing demographic and \nepidemiological situation.  \n \n11.  The Project will help address these challenges in implementing F1 and SDAH by providing \ncredit  to  both  LGUs  and  private  providers  to  upgrade  health  facilities  in  order  to  obtain \naccreditation and provide better health services. In addition to the direct benefits of better services, \naccreditation will trigger PHIC reimbursement. That will reduce the cost of health care for the poor, \nwhich in turn will contribute to achieving MDGs. Government oversight, provincial plans, eligibility \ncriteria for providers and subprojects, marketing, and monitoring will assist in targeting maternal \nand child health and the poor in general. The introduction of new packages for maternal and child \nhealth and outpatient care currently under preparation by PHIC will further trigger access and \nquality enhancement while increasing affordability. The health sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Access and Affordability  \n \n12.  Demand for health services remains low among the poor and vulnerable groups.8 This may be \ndue to a variety of reasons, including (i) the relatively high cost of medical care, drugs and transport; \n(ii) social and cultural biases of both patients and providers; (iii) lack of understanding of modern \nmedical care; and (iv) limited geographical access to services. Households have limited information on \nhealth benefits and costs, and they may be reluctant to use services due to the perceived poor quality \nor high cost of care. Only 37% of users of public hospitals were satisfied with public health services \n(footnote 8). Facility-based childbirth remains low among the poor (11% among the poor, versus 38% \noverall in 2003). Child immunization coverage is also lower (55% among the poor, versus 70% overall \nin 2003). The poor primarily use the barangay health stations or rural health units for health care \nbecause of access and affordability considerations (79%). When possible, however, lower level care \nis bypassed for higher-level care even when not needed, contributing to low occupancy rates (20%\u2013\n40%) in district hospitals and overuse of provincial hospitals. System reforms and investments for \nupgrading are required that will redistribute demand by appropriate levels of care.  \n \n13.  The cost of health care, including for drugs, is a key reason for the low utilization by the poor. \nEstimates suggest that about 30%\u201340% of the population finds it difficult to pay for drugs.9 Financial \nprotection against illness costs has been one of the Government\u2019s top priorities. A social health \ninsurance  program\u2014PHIC\u2014was  established  in  1995  with  the  mandate  to  provide  financial \nprotection against illness costs. A decade later, coverage is still not universal and is extremely low \namong the informal sectors and the poor (50% among the poor, versus 73% overall in 2007).10 The \n                                                 \n7  SDAH is not yet a full sector-wide approach, as, for example, projects are administered and financed separately.      \n8  National Statistics Office. 2006. Philippine National Demographic Health Survey. Manila. \n9  Retail drug prices are estimated to be six times the international reference pricing at public facilities, and 15 times the \ninternational reference pricing at private facilities. The poor often rely on private retailers, as public sector drug stores \nand health facilities where drugs are subsidized often lack supplies.  \n10 On average, only 66% of indigents and the poor are covered under the PHIC-sponsored program. The poverty \nidentification methodology is unreliable, and estimates suggest that at least one-third of those under the sponsored \n ", "4 \n \nlack of mandatory financial contribution from central or local governments limits enrollment of the \npoor in PHIC.  \n \n14.  F1 promotes enrollment of the poor in PHIC through cost-sharing of the premium. The \nbiggest drawback of the current PHIC contribution, however, is that it only reimburses a small part \nof the expenses. Household out-of-pocket spending for health had increased to 48% of total health \nspending in 2005, often with serious consequences on household assets and livelihoods. PHIC \ncould increase its share, as it has high financial reserves unnecessary for assuring its solvency. \nThese could be wisely spent in the sector.  \n  \n15.  The original PHIC benefits package was for hospital services (catastrophic illnesses), not \nfor outpatient services and medicines. Basic treatments for common conditions of the poor were \nnot reimbursed. This perpetuated hospitalization and unnecessary expenses. PHIC will launch new \nbenefits packages to help address the health care needs of the poor, women, and children. These \ninclude (i) the new patient prepaid service package where all insured poor receive a basic package \nof service at no cost;11 (ii) the maternity care package (for prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care) \nthat reimburses expenses to public and private health providers; (iii) the newborn care package, \nwhich reimburses for childcare, including immunization against childhood diseases; and (iv) the \npackage to support strengthening of referral networks, such as district hospitals. The benefits \npackages are still not comprehensive and fragmented, but in the interim should provide the poor \nbetter financial protection against illness costs. It will also improve access and equity by engaging \nthe private sector and small-scale health providers who operate closer to communities, and it will \nprovide an incentive for LGUs to accredit public clinics closer to the communities. The service \npackages  will  be  promoted  among  health  providers  and  PHIC  beneficiaries.  The  Project  will \nprovide credit for providers seeking PHIC accreditation to support these PHIC benefits packages. \n \n3.  Quality and Efficiency \n \n16.  The public sector has an expanded network of services reaching down to the village level. \nSince  devolution,  however,  the  health  delivery  system  faces  fragmented  organization  and \nmanagement, delivery, and financing, which appear to favor investments in urban hospitals.12 \nSupply and distribution of public goods and services, such as vaccinations against communicable \ndiseases, essential drugs, and family planning commodities, remain insufficient.13 Basic health \nservices, with limited LGU commitment, often have inadequate personnel, equipment, or supplies, \nresulting  in  patients\u2019  inability  to  use  services  or  self-referring  to  hospitals  unnecessarily.  The \nPhilippines produces a large number of doctors and nurses, but the increasing export of medical \npersonnel for overseas employment has resulted in staff shortages and quality constraints. Further, \nbasic health services are not linked to appropriate referral services, making it difficult, for example, \nto address childbirth complications.  \n \n17.  While a substantial share of public finance is allocated to tertiary hospitals (45% in 2005), the \nreform agenda for hospital autonomy has moved little. Many local public hospitals run inefficiently, \nhaving low quality of medical and ancillary services, over- or underutilization of beds, unnecessary \nuse of hospitals for basic health services, long waiting lines, high-costs incurred by patients due to \nlimited diagnostic services and unnecessary use of drugs, and lack of management systems. Most \nhospitals lack trained hospital managers and are not financially sustainable. Further, public hospitals \n                                                                                                                                                               \nprogram are not poor. The Department of Social Welfare and Development is refining the methodology, with PHIC \nadoption expected in 2009.  \n11 PHIC capitation is too low at P300 (or $6) per family per year, leading to a concern that LGUs may have insufficient \nincentive to accredit public clinics. \n12 For example, PHIC reimbursement for the same services is higher at tertiary versus secondary hospitals. \n13 The World Bank has responded to some of this underfunding in public health commodities by providing lending for the \nNational Sector Support for Health Reform Project in 2006. Assistance is also provided by Global Health Fund. ", "    5 \nface competition from private hospitals in the same area attracting the nonpoor by offering qualified \nstaff and modern medical equipment and diagnostic services. Hospitals are often competing rather \nthan seeking partnership arrangements.  \n \n18.  The large private hospitals are typically located in urban areas and provide curative services. \nSmaller private clinics also operate in rural areas. The private sector is largely unregulated, and its \nperformance is not easy to monitor. Service delivery standards and user fees are understood to vary \nconsiderably in response to earnings and other financial incentives.14 The past incentive structures \n(such as reimbursements under PHIC) were targeted to curative health care and tertiary inpatient \nservices. This triggered more investment in curative health care, especially hospitals, and to a \nskewed distribution in favor of urban areas.  \n \n19.  Under F1, LGUs are encouraged to seek partnership with the private sector. Recent DOH \nmandates and development of the PHIC benefit packages for basic health care should provide \nincentives for LGUs and the private sector to improve services. DOH has taken some steps to build \ncapacity for public\u2013private collaborations.15 The tuberculosis program provides a good example of \nsuch  partnership.16 The  generic  drugs  retail  program  (botika  ng  bayan)  was  initiated  through \npartnership with nonprofit community outlets. The private providers (clinics and hospitals) are being \nbrought into the network of providers in the provinces under PHIC accreditation.17 The private \nsector\u2019s response could address shortages of (i) medical personnel in underserved areas, (ii) public \nhealth care for the poor, and (iii) complementary services to the public sector where there are market \nfailures. The revised PHIC MDG care package creates an incentive for small-scale health providers \nto be accredited and reimbursed for services provided to PHIC beneficiaries. Likewise, the private \nretail drug outlets could improve their inventories and expand access to affordable generic drugs. \nThe Project has an opportunity to provide access to credit for LGUs and private small-scale providers \nin order to accredit their facilities and strengthen basic health services. \n \n20.  Further, LGU hospitals are undertaking several local initiatives: Some have taken steps to \nbecome  economic  enterprises  although  their  financial  sustainability  still  depends  on  salaries \ncovered by government budgets. Others have moved to improve effectiveness and efficiencies \nthrough outsourcing diagnostic and laboratory services or contracting in clinical care from the \nprivate sector. Some forms of efficiencies could be attained by public hospitals through improved \nmanagement systems, inventory systems, telemedicine, and information technology. Improved \npartnerships between the private sector and public hospitals could result in minimizing costs and \nmaximizing services for beneficiaries. PPP could help increase access, lower costs, and improve \nquality of facilities and services. The Project has an opportunity to promote access to credit by \nLGUs and the private sector for innovative strategies and efficiency gains. \n \n4.  Quality Assurance and Accountability Mechanisms \n \n21.  The  quality  assurance  mechanisms  in  place,  such  as  DOH\u2019s  licensing  and  PHIC\u2019s \n                                                 \n14 Many private medical personnel are unwilling to go to rural and remote areas, as the poor are unable to pay for \nservices and LGUs have not insured the poor under PHIC. Costs of relocation and accreditation are high, and \nparticularly small and medium-sized health providers do not have financial resources or access to credit by which to \nsurvive in rural and remote areas. Midwives often live in close proximity to the population, including in the rural areas, \nand they could also benefit from credit to set up clinics.  \n15 DOH  promotes  public\u2013private  collaborations  and  coordination.  Such  initiatives  are  underway,  although  no \ncomprehensive policy or guidelines exist to form PPPs. DOH is taking steps in this direction.  \n16 This  involves  a  coalition  between  DOH,  thoracic  physicians,  infectious  disease  control  specialists,  and  the \npharmaceutical industry. \n17 Among solutions for LGUs are (i) contracting between public and private sectors to ensure the availability of staffing in \npublic facilities, (ii) contracting with private hospitals or specialists for emergency referrals, (iii) increasing development \nand operations budgets (or access to affordable credit financing) for public facility accreditation, and (iv) improving \nPHIC and other incentives for an appropriate market supply and demand response. \n ", "6 \n \naccreditation of public and private health facilities, ensure that at least minimum quality standards \nare maintained.18 Although licensing of health providers is mandatory, accreditation is voluntary. \nHealth providers seek accreditation to become eligible for PHIC reimbursements for operating \nexpenditures and reduce the cost of care for PHIC beneficiaries. In the public sector, limited capital \nspending and reduced operating expenses have resulted in acute needs for building rehabilitation \nand modern equipment. Additionally, the public sector faces shortages and skewed distribution of \nhealth  personnel.  PHIC  provides  inadequate  incentives  for  some  providers  to  maintain \naccreditation standards, and several health facilities do not meet minimum standards. Only 40% of \npublic clinics are accredited. Although 90% of public hospitals are accredited, many are just partially \nor under-accredited. In the private sector, small-scale health providers may also lack capital to meet \nthe accreditation standards and therefore are unable to offer PHIC benefits. Limited accreditation \nalso hinders access to information, thereby influencing health providers\u2019 quality and performance.  \n \n22.  PHIC is currently upgrading its accreditation standards to be more performance-based and \nmeet  international  best  practices,  and  it  is  creating  incentives  for  health  facilities  to  seek \naccreditation.  Several  public  and  private  health  care  facilities  anticipated  making  capital \ninvestments to meet the new accreditation standards. The Project provides an opportunity to \naccess credit for such investments.  \n \n23.   Although all accredited health facilities have access to PHIC reimbursement, PHIC has \nlimited influence on health providers\u2019 coverage of beneficiaries or on the price and quality of services \nprovided. To strengthen accountability mechanisms, PHIC is exploring how to introduce contracting \nwith health providers with regard to service type and package, quality, price, and location. A contract \nwould give PHIC better leverage with the providers, as well as opportunity to establish standards for \nservice performance and to assess beneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction with the services. Contracting could \nreduce balance billing and contain health care cost inflation while improving financial protection for \nPHIC beneficiaries. PHIC is now outlining legal agreements, and it plans to negotiate contract terms \nwith  selected  accredited  health  providers  who  are  willing  and  have  the  capacity  to  fulfill  the \ncontractual  terms.  PHIC  is  building  its  capacity  for  performance  monitoring,  and  there  is  an \nopportunity for the Project to support the development of a results-focused system of accountability.  \n \n5.  Financing and Access to Credit \n \n24.  Under the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, health service delivery was devolved to \nLGUs, and provinces and municipalities are required to cover capital and recurrent expenditures \nfor services under their responsibility, including those for health care. An LGU\u2019s budget is sourced \nthrough (i) national government internal revenue allotment (IRA),19 and (ii) local government tax-\nbased revenues and income-generation programs. Revenues of provinces and municipalities vary \nwidely, however, and several LGUs greatly depend on national government financial support. \n \n25.  The  budget  allocation  for  health  is  at  LGUs\u2019  discretion,  since  no  specific  formula  is \nmandated in the LGC and no formula is used for its allocation. LGUs have often not kept to LGC \nrecommendations. For example, personnel expenses have increased significantly (to represent on \naverage 69% of the LGU budget), thereby reducing operating expenses to almost half (averaging \n30% of the LGU budget). LGU recurrent spending on health care is insufficient for drugs and \nsupplies and for communicable disease control programs. Capital outlays for health care have \nbeen  very  low  (on  average  at  2%  of  LGU  health  spending).  Bottlenecks  that  constrain \n                                                 \n18 PHIC\u2019s accreditation system checks for availability of minimum inputs (e.g., water, sanitation, human resources, \nequipment) needed for a functioning health facility. Accreditation at least ensures availability of key inputs and safety \nstandards. PHIC new accreditation standards (the Benchbook) will move to that of performance benchmarks.  \n19 The formula for IRA to LGUs is not pro-poor. Allocation is determined 50% by population size, 25% by land size, and \n25% by equal sharing. IRA is divided among provinces (23%), cities (23%), municipalities (34%) and barangays (20%). ", "    7 \nimprovements in local health service delivery and governance can be attributed to (i) fragmentation \nand  unclear  functional  and  expenditure  assignments  between  administrative  levels  (central, \nprovincial, and municipality), (ii) lack of mandates on health spending, (iii) resource constraints, (iv) \nweak fiscal and expenditure management, and (v) limited performance monitoring.  \n \n26.  Through F1, DOH has taken some steps to improve resources and their efficient use by \n(i) bringing LGUs into public partnerships to improve access to quality health services and ensure \nbetter  budget  allocation;  (ii)  offering  support  to  LGUs  on  performance-based  ongranting;  (iii) \npromoting  the  pooling  of  budgets  from  various  municipalities  to  rationalize  and  to  provide \nappropriate allocations for effective health service delivery; (iv) partnering with nonpublic-sector \nentities and thereby rationalizing healthcare  investments; and (v) ensuring cost-effective and cost-\nefficient  modalities, including  PPPs,  in  health care  financing  and  delivery.  Further  efforts  are \nrequired to strengthen and operationalize these initiatives.   \n \n27.  Resource-constrained LGUs are permitted under the LGC to seek credit20 financing for \ninfrastructure development, capital investment, and, in some cases, operating expenses, but they \nface limited access to credit for the health sector. The 1996 LGU financing framework promotes \ngraduating LGUs to creditworthy status in order to access private sources of capital. LGUs are \nconstrained in borrowing from the private capital markets, however, due to (i) a limited number of \nprivate banks accredited as LGU IRA depositories or with access to IRA intercept; (ii) limited \ncollateral, thus preventing normal creditor-borrower relationships from being established; and (iii) \nLGUs\u2019 lack of credit history, meaning they cannot demonstrate creditworthiness. Further, LGU \nhealth projects are (i) nonrevenue generating and less attractive for private capital markets, and (ii) \nlonger term for reasons of financial sustainability while private markets lend for shorter terms.  \n \n28.   The Government is improving systems to allow LGU access to private capital markets. The \nADB-supported Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program Cluster21 enhances \nLGUs\u2019 financial self-sufficiency, and during 2008\u20132010 it will (i) simplify debt service capacity \ncertification of LGUs, and (ii) prepare guidelines and test its functionality for LGUs to set up IRA \ndepository accounts in private banks. As borrowing from private capital markets is more typical for \nrevenue-generating projects, alternatives must be considered for LGUs to access credit for projects \nin the health sector. \n \n29.   The 1996 LGU credit policy framework promotes optimizing involvement of GFIs22 in LGU \nfinancing, and directs GFIs and MDFO23 to act as catalysts to bring LGUs into the mainstream of \nprivate capital markets. Of 1,800 LGUs, only 14 are fully creditworthy, 945 (52%) are creditworthy but \nunable to tap private capital markets, and 726 (40%) are marginally creditworthy. Creditworthy LGUs \nunable to tap private capital markets can access GFI credit. MDFO lends to LGUs that are marginally \nor not creditworthy. For example, ADB\u2019s Health Sector Development Program (HSDP),24 uses MDFO \nas the conduit for relending to LGUs. \n \n                                                 \n20 The public sector traditionally relied on subsidized credit, but this constrained growth of private credit financing. The \nGovernment introduced a policy discouraging subsidized directed credit programs, and it mandated moving all such \nprograms under financial institutions, where commercially managed programs follow market-based interest rates \n(Executive Order No. 138, 1999). \n21 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Local Government Financing and Budget Report Program Cluster. Manila.  \n22 GFIs\u2019 risk of relending to LGUs is minimized, as they can hold IRA depositories or require advanced depositories to be \nset up in their branch banks. \n23 MDFO was established under the Department of Finance in 1998 as a revolving fund to support LGU borrowing for \ninfrastructure.  \n24 ADB. 2004.

In 2007, DBP, one of the GFIs, approved a credit facility for lending at market-based interest \nrates under the umbrella of DBP\u2019s Sustainable Health Care Investment Program.25 This opens up an \navenue for GFI lending to creditworthy LGUs unable to tap private capital markets for health projects. \nLGUs in fiscal capacity income class levels 1 and 2, as well as others that are creditworthy, are \nexpected to gravitate toward GFIs. LGU consultation highlighted a need for access to credit for \nhealth  development  projects  (infrastructure,  equipment,  supplies,  and  consulting  services)  and \npotential interest in borrowing from GFIs (but at viable terms). The Philippines credit policy framework \nfor LGUs is described in Appendix 3. \n \n31.   The Government supports enhancing access to credit for small and medium enterprises \n(SMEs), and GFIs (such as DBP) use microfinance institutions (MFIs)26 for this purpose. SMEs face \nconstraints in accessing credit financing, particularly given limited collateral and skills to prepare \nbusiness proposals and credit applications. The nongovernment small-scale health care providers \ninclude such home-based small businesses as midwives, physician-run small clinics, and drug stores \nin rural municipalities. These providers\u2019 credit needs are small, but the benefits are substantial. \nAccess to credit improves the sustainability of these small-scale health care providers (particularly \ngiven the opportunity for PHIC accreditation and reimbursement to cover operating expenses) and it \nprovides financial protection to PHIC beneficiaries, especially the poor.  \n \n6.  External Assistance and Aid Harmonization \n \n32.  DOH introduced the SDAH in 2005 and asked development partners to align their programs \nto support DOH\u2019s F1 through the Joint Assessment and Planning Initiative.27 DOH has prioritized \nmaternal health care and prepared the medium-term health sector expenditure framework. DOH \nand partners are currently working on the health care financing strategy, a performance-monitoring \ntool, private sector engagement, rationalizing investment in the provinces and LGUs, and the \nanalysis of training programs.  \n \n33.  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  supports  F1  and  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework, and it promotes integrated programs and a public\u2013private mix on maternal and child \nhealth  and  disease  control.  The  European  Commission  committed  grant  support  to  16  F1 \nconvergence sites for primary health care, strengthening financial and procurement management \nsystems, and refining PHIC\u2019s benefits package and provider payment mechanisms. The World Bank \nis  providing  national-level  budget  support  for  essential  public  health  commodities,  as  well  as \nresources to enroll the poor within PHIC\u2019s sponsored program. German development cooperation \nthrough GTZ is assisting PHIC to refine accreditation standards and increase coverage of the \ninformal  sector  beneficiaries.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  among \nothers, is supporting PPP in public health care delivery. Collectively, the development partners are \noverseeing the refinement and implementation of F1 and an improved PHIC.  \n \n34.  The  proposed  Project  is  in  line  with  F1,  and  it  will  support  DBP\u2019s  program.  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW will provide parallel support on commercial lending terms for \ninvestments in private secondary and tertiary hospitals. A list of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n25 The DBP accumulated a pipeline for health sector borrowing in the amount of P7 billion. Of these, proposals for P3.5 \nbillion have been received, 10% of which are from government and the balance from the private sector. DBP used its \nown resources to lend about P1.9 billion in the health sector, with P1.7 billion (87%) going to private hospitals and the \nbalance of P0.2 billion going to the public sector and cooperatives. \n26 The Government mandates the growth of MFIs to provide access to credit financing for small businesses and families. \nMFI's include rural banks, cooperatives, and NGOs.  \n27 ADB,  European  Commission,  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  and  KfW,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Population Fund, United States Agency for \nInternational Development, World Bank, and WHO.

ADB  has  been  engaged  in  the  health  sector  since  1994.28 Of  the  five  health  projects \nsupported by ADB, three closed with a satisfactory rating. The other two projects are ongoing. ADB\u2019s \ninitial projects were investment projects focusing on delivery of community health care services, \nparticularly to women and children. In 2004, ADB shifted its assistance toward policy reforms and \nhealth care system strengthening.  \n \n36.  The HSDP was a sector development project that supported DOH\u2019s Health Sector Reform \nAgenda through a policy reform and an investment loan (footnote 24). The policy actions included, \namong  others,  (i)  budgetary  support  of  the  Government  for  enrolling  the  poor  into  PHIC; \n(ii) refinement of the PHIC benefits package to include cost-effective interventions, MDG care, and \nsupport  for  the  poor  through  the  outpatient  care  package;  (iii)  refinement  of  guidelines  and \ngovernment orders to build partnerships with the private sector for priority public health programs; \n(iv) promotion of contraceptives financing and refining the essential drugs list and delivery; and \n(v) rationalizing and integrating LGU health service delivery, including to promote quality standards \nthrough PHIC accreditation. The investment component focused on strengthening health services in \nthree of the 16 F1 convergence sites, in coordination with the European Commission. \n \n37.  ADB continues policy dialogue on many of these HSDP policy areas to address issues of \naccess, quality, and efficiency of health services delivery. Recent key policy areas of engagement \ninclude (i) introduction by DOH of a comprehensive policy on PPP in health, and (ii) introduction of \na contracting instrument by PHIC that would allow arrangements between PHIC and the health \ncare providers to ensure good quality and affordable goods and services for PHIC beneficiaries. \nADB continues to support the F1 for health and to work alongside the other development partners.  \n \n38.  Further, ADB\u2019s Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program Cluster supports \nlocal government reforms in enhancing effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of critical \npublic services (footnote 21). The program cluster will boost real expenditures for service delivery \n(including for health, education, and the environment) by at least 2% annually from 2008. Of the \n1,800 LGUs, 131 received financing by 2007 and an additional 250 are expected to receive it by \n2010 for improving service delivery through investment in environmental and health projects. The \nproposed Project follows the principles of the LGU financing and credit policy framework for \nonlending to LGUs, and it complements the program cluster by supporting LGUs, in the interim, to \naccess credit from GFIs for health development projects.  \n \n39.  DBP has set up a separate credit facility for the health sector. ADB's lending to DBP since \n1975 is significant and has been in various social sectors, although its involvement in the health \nsector is recent. Among the seven completed ADB-financed projects with DBP, two were rated \nsatisfactory, and three partly satisfactory. Among the reasons cited for concerns were (i) lack of \ncompetitive interest rates offered by DBP as compared to the market, presenting a constraint for \nsmall-scale  subborrowers;  and  (ii)  limits  on  the  subborrower  profile  where  onlending  could  be \npursued  by  financial  intermediaries.  DBP  has  addressed  these  concerns  by  (i)  accepting  the \n                                                 \n28 Three of ADB\u2019s past health projects were cofinanced: (i) ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the Republic of the Philippines for the Early Childhood Development \nProject. Manila (Loans 1606/1607-PHI, cofinanced by the World Bank); (ii) ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Women\u2019s \nHealth and Safe Motherhood Project. Manila (Loan 1331-PHI, cofinanced by the Australian International Development \nAssistance Bureau, European Commission, German development cooperation through KfW, and the World Bank); and \n(iii) ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Philippines for the Integrated Community Health Services Project. \nManila (Loan 1396-PHI, cofinanced by the Australian Agency for International Development). The ongoing HSDP \n(footnote 24) works in coordination with other development partners under the sector-wide approach for health.   \n ", "10 \n \nDepartment of Finance proposal to reduce its spread, and (ii) adding a wholesale relending window \nfor small-scale subborrowers. During preparation of the proposed Project, LGUs and small-scale \nhealth providers were consulted as to their potential to borrow from DBP. During the first year of its \nimplementation, the Project will market to potential subborrowers and conduct further consultations. \n \n40.  Implementation has generally been slow under externally financed DOH and DBP projects, \nand this will be a concern for the proposed Project. Steps are being taken to mitigate this risk by \nsupporting partnership between DBP and other technical agencies, as well as by recommending \nthat DBP recruit a team of experts, including a full-time health specialist, for providing technical \nsupport to the subborrowers to enhance their implementation and monitoring capacity for the \nProject. For sustainability of the credit facility, the proposed Project will work toward building the \ncapacity of DBP staff on health sector appraisal and monitoring, social marketing, and safeguards. \nTo strengthen the capacity and access to credit for the subborrowers, partnership will be sought \nwith other government and nongovernment technical agencies. PHIC will form close partnership \nunder DBP in marketing benefit packages and through its contracting modality. \n \n41.  DOH and DBP have not conducted before and after surveys for some projects, making it \ndifficult to assess project performance. The proposed Project recommends DBP provide resources \nand  mechanisms  to  conduct  studies  before  and  after  subproject  investment,  as  well  as  to \nindependently monitor overall project performance through its Evaluation Department to ensure \ndevelopment objectives are met and that the poor and underserved are benefiting from the Project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n42.  The impact of the Project is improved overall health status, especially in relation to MDG 4 \n(reduce child mortality), and MDG 5 (improve maternal health) by 2015. The Project\u2019s outcome is \nincreased use of basic health care and referral services by the poor in general, and by women and \nchildren in particular, in the subproject sites. The Project will be nationwide,29 with the exception of \nthe National Capital Region.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n43.  The project outputs are (i) upgraded LGU health services, (ii) more efficient health care \ndelivery systems through PPP and innovative strategies, (iii) improved access to small-scale private \nproviders, and (iv) enhanced institutional capacity for health sector lending. \n \n44.  The  Project  supports  DBP\u2019s  recently  established  credit  program  for  the  health  sector. \nProject funds will be relent to public and private health services providers for capital investments \nand working capital. The funds will be used for (i) retail or direct lending to larger subprojects in the \npublic and private sectors, and (ii) wholesale relending through accredited financial intermediaries \nto private sector smaller-scale subprojects. The Project will use ADB\u2019s development financial \nintermediary lending modality. \n \n45.  Specifically, the DBP credit will be used for subprojects that aim to (i) improve quality of health \ncare services to attain health care facility accreditation (under the PHIC); (ii) address the gaps in \naccess to basic health services (for communicable disease control, women and child health care, \n                                                 \n29 The Project relies on subborrowers\u2019 willingness and ability to apply for loans from DBP. The Project follows the LGU \ncredit policy framework, whereby MDFO, GFIs, and private capital markets each have a role (Appendix 3). The Project \nwill support retail relending to those areas where LGUs already have memorandums of agreement with DOH on \nsupporting F1. It also will support wholesale relending starting with those areas that are supported under the Gender  \nand Development Cooperation Fund.  ", "    11 \nclinical care, ancillary services, and generic drugs); and (iii) improve efficiency and effectiveness in \nhealth  service  delivery  through  outsourcing,  improvement  in  management  systems,  and  other \ninnovative strategies. In addition to direct benefits resulting from this investment, it is anticipated that \nLGU\u2019s total recurrent budgets could increase, as LGUs will be expected to commit to increased \nallocation of recurrent budgets for health. Further, PHIC accreditation can provide an added stream of \nresources through PHIC reimbursements for operating expenses\u2014including personnel per diems and \ndrugs\u2014and can offer some financial protection to the population. Partnerships can help address \nshortages in financial and human resources without relying entirely on government budgets. Service \nperformance outputs can be stimulated through contracts between PHIC and health care providers \nthat stipulate beneficiaries, service packages, and prices charged.  \n \n46.    Eligible subborrowers will be LGUs and private sector health providers who support \nF1 and are committed to meeting MDGs. Eligible LGUs are those that (i) are responsible for public \nclinics and public hospitals in the municipalities and the provinces; (ii) have inadequate resources \nand cannot easily attain central government grant support; (iii) are creditworthy but unable to tap \nprivate capital markets; and (iv) are seeking access to credit to attain PHIC accreditation or \nupgrades,  PPP,  and/or  health  system  efficiencies.  Eligible  private  subborrowers  include \nfoundations, health maintenance organizations, and small-scale health care providers who lack \naccess to credit, and/or do not have appropriate collateral. Service providers include laboratories \nand other diagnostic services, referral networks, midwifery and physician care needing to attain \nPHIC accreditation or upgrades; generic drug retailers who need Philippine International Trading \nCorporation  accreditation;  and  rural  drug  distributors  willing  to  expand  their  networks  in \nmunicipalities. Eligible subprojects are those who meet the following (i) inclusion in the province-\nwide investment plan for health or DOH's certificate of needs for new health facilities and permit to \nconstruct; (ii) for hospitals, a hospital diagnostic center or hospital development plan, including \nfeasibility, financial sustainability, and utilization forecasts; (iii) location in an underserved area; (iv) \nare licensed or accredited by DOH and/or Bureau of Food and Drugs and/or Philippine International \nTrading Corporation and/or PHIC; (v) for LGUs, have the commitment of the LGU for funding \noperations  and  maintenance  cost;  and  (iv)  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  the  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. The eligible organizations (public or private) will have to \ndemonstrate  that  the  investments  will  result  in  better  health  services  and  benefit  targeted \nbeneficiaries. The eligibility criteria for subborrowers and subprojects are in Appendix 5. \n \n1.  Upgraded LGU Health Services  \n \n47.  This output will support LGUs to upgrade health services, develop referral networks to \nstrengthen maternal and child health services, and improve standards and efficiencies of hospitals \nas per their commitment under F1. An eligible LGU will be required to have a DOH-approved \nprovince-wide investment plan for health and a certificate of needs for constructing new facilities \nand purchasing high-end equipment. Eligible LGUs will have to demonstrate that they have the \nfiscal capacity to borrow (certificate required from Department of Finance) and provide assurances \nas to the availability of recurrent budgets, especially for drugs and operations. It is anticipated that \nunder this output, DBP will relend to about 77 LGUs30 (or about 5% of LGUs in the country), and \nthat each LGU will require an average of $500,000 equivalent (ranging from $100,000 to $2 million \nequivalent).  \n \n48.  Construction and Rehabilitation. LGUs will obtain credit to upgrade health facilities to \nmeet  or  improve  PHIC  accreditation  standards.  Eligible  investments  will  include  civil  works \n(construction and rehabilitation according to government standards) for hospitals, rural health units, \nand barangay health stations, including clean water supply, sanitation, and appropriate waste \n                                                 \n30 An LGU is defined as a municipality or a city. \n ", "12 \n \nmanagement.  Credit  support  may  be  provided  to  LGUs  for  preparing  feasibility  studies, \narchitectural and engineering design, civil works supervision, and environmental risk mitigation. \n \n49.  Procurement of Equipment. LGUs will obtain credit to procure appropriate medical and \nnonmedical equipment for health care facilities to meet PHIC accreditation. The list of eligible \nequipment for each level of health facility follows PHIC accreditation and DOH licensing standards. \nIn addition, credit may be provided for working capital to pay for a stock of supplies for the first half-\nyear, procuring medical and information and communication technology equipment, and for an \ninitial stock of drugs and reagents to be used in an upgraded or newly built facility. Mobile clinics \nand mobile diagnostics may be supported with adequate justification. Procurements will include \nstaff training in the maintenance and operation of procured equipment, its cost implications, and its \nappropriate use. \n \n50.  Develop Integrated Health Care Delivery System. Close collaboration and partnership \nwill be required between DBP and DOH to assist LGUs to develop an integrated health care \ndelivery  network.  Health  human  resource  development  may  include  training  and  career \ndevelopment for personnel to enhance capacity. In addition, DOH will provide opportunities for \ncapacity development to LGUs.  \n \n2.  More  Efficient  Health  Care  Delivery  Systems  through  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership and Innovative Strategies \n \n51.  This output will support PPP and innovative strategies that aim to build an integrated health \ncare delivery system, as well as to improve efficiency, quality, and cost-risk sharing. Both public \nand private providers will be given access to credit for capital investment and/or working capital. \nPPP options may include health care facility construction, financing, management, and services \ndelivery. Types of eligible subprojects are (i) outsourcing technical, medical (e.g., to cooperatives), \nand ancillary services; (ii) outsourcing support services such as security, housekeeping, food \nservices, and laundry; (iii) contracting in the management of a public facility; (iv) contracting private \nproviders to deliver health services; and (v) contracting private insurance schemes for specific \npopulations. Innovative strategies could include generic drug bulk procurement or consignment, \nestablishment of telemedicine, and strengthening management systems. The Project will help \nLGUs conduct feasibility studies to examine potentially cost-effective options for consideration by \nthe Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee (see para. 68). The Project will lend to about \nthree to four PPP subprojects. \n \n3.  Improved Access to Small-Scale Private Providers \n \n52.  This output will support the private sector to help address such public health priorities as \naccess to quality maternal and child health services, as well as to complement the public system \nwhere such shortages exist as for medical personnel in some rural areas. DBP\u2019s accredited \nfinancial intermediaries (MFIs, cooperatives, and rural and thrift banks) will access credit from \nDBP\u2019s program for onlending to locations underperforming in public health priorities. DBP will be \nrelending project funds to about 20 of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries, which in turn will \nonlend to about 2,100 end subprojects. The potential subborrowers are about 1,800 midwifery \nclinics, 200 clinical and diagnostic facilities, 100 community drug stores (botika ng bayan), and 10 \ndrug distribution companies catering to rural municipalities. \n \n53.  Upgrading Private Services. Financial intermediaries will access credit for onlending to \nprivate, small-scale health services providers for civil works to meet or improve PHIC accreditation \nstandards. Eligible investments will include civil works (construction and rehabilitation) for clinics, \ndrug stores, and diagnostic centers. Drug distribution companies catering to rural municipalities will \nbe eligible for investment in drug warehouses. Private sector, small-scale health services providers ", "    13 \nwill have access to credit for procuring appropriate medical and nonmedical equipment for health \nfacilities to meet or improve PHIC accreditation. The equipment list for each facility follows PHIC \naccreditation and DOH licensing standards or those of other government accreditation agencies. \nCredit support will also be provided for working capital (including for procuring a stock of supplies \nfor the first half-year, medical and information and communication technology, and the initial stock \nof drugs and reagents to be used in the upgraded or newly built facility). Mobile clinics, mobile \ndiagnostics,  and  cold-chain  and  drug  distribution  vehicles  will  require  justification  under  the \nprovince-wide investment plans for health. The Project will ensure training of subborrowers for the \nprocured equipment\u2019s maintenance and operation, cost implications, and appropriate use.  \n \n54.  Supporting  Financial  Intermediaries  to  Build  the  Health  Onlending  Product.  The \nProject will build capacity of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries for onlending to small-scale \nhealth  providers.  A  training  curriculum  will  be  developed  and  training  delivered  to  financial \nintermediaries  for  product  development,  financial  sustainability  analysis,  and  subproject \nappraisal.31 The  financial  intermediaries,  in  turn,  will  train  potential  end-borrowers  in  financial \nliteracy, sustainable health care enterprise development (particularly in making their services more \naccessible and affordable to these potential end-borrowers), and compliance with environmental \nrisk mitigation (standards set and recommended by DOH). The training program is expected to \ncover about 20 of DBP\u2019s accredited financial intermediaries.  \n \n55.  Enhancing Midwives\u2019 Entrepreneurial and Financial Literacy. This important activity and \nsubcomponent  aims  to  address  structural  barriers  inhibiting  midwives  from  accessing  credit  to \nexpand their facilities and services. The subcomponent will support midwives to be accredited by \nPHIC through (i) a review of PHIC standards, processes, and benefits packages for private midwives \naccreditation; (ii) health literacy training; and (iii) business development and banking literacy. The \nactivity also includes legal empowerment on women\u2019s health rights, entitlements, and services. \nProposed activities will be implemented in three provinces and nine municipalities or cities and will be \nsupported by grant assistance not exceeding $400,000 equivalent to DBP for enhanced midwives\u2019 \nentrepreneurial and financial literacy to be provided by the Gender and Development Cooperation \nFund.32 The subcomponent is summarized in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n4.  Enhanced Institutional Capacity for Health Sector Lending \n \n56.  This output will strengthen the capacity of DBP in dealing with health sector support at \nnational and branch office levels. Given DBP\u2019s recent engagement in the health sector, its lending \npolicy framework for the health sector needs to be refined to support F1. Additionally, there is a need \nto develop implementation and operational guidelines for DBP\u2019s credit to the health sector. Since a \nnew product is being created for lending to MFIs through the wholesale window, refinements are \nneeded for appraising and monitoring performance of health sector lending. Engagement with LGUs \nand MFIs for health subprojects requires a long-term social marketing strategy. DBP has limited in-\nhouse sectoral capacity, and, although steps are being taken to train staff in sector knowledge, \ncontinuous in-service training is required for account officers who market the product, appraise \nsubprojects, and monitor implementation. Such capacity development is also needed among relevant \nMFIs. Since DBP has a complementary role under the LGU credit policy framework, the Project will \nwork closely with the various stakeholders (e.g., DOH and MDFO) to develop a strong capacity for \nrelending to LGUs for the health sector. The Project will strengthen the capacity of DBP\u2019s program \ndevelopment, program evaluation, and marketing group to manage and monitor health sector \nprojects, including to form close collaboration with PHIC for setting up contracts with subborrowers. \n \n                                                 \n31 DBP\u2019s ongoing system provides technical assistance and ensures DBP requirements are complied with by potential \nsubborrowers through 13 business assistance centers located in state colleges and universities.  \n32 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. Administered by ADB. \n ", "14 \n \n57.  Strengthening Capacity for Health Sector Lending. The Project, in close coordination \nwith the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee, will provide technical sector support to DBP \nto  (i)  refine  DBP\u2019s  program  sector  lending  framework,  (ii)  enhance  the  lending  strategy,  (iii) \nupgrade the appraisal procedures (incorporating financial, nonfinancial, and health performance \nindicators), (iv) streamline assessment of sector needs given the development objectives, and (v) \nform partnerships with the government as well as with private agencies and associations. The \nProject,  through  DBP\u2019s  budget,  will  provide  technical  support  to  ensure  that  an  appropriate \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  is  in  place  that  includes  financial  and  health  performance \nindicators. \n \n58.  Strengthening Lending Product Performance. The Project will provide technical support \nto DBP\u2019s wholesale unit (central and branch offices) to design the health lending product offered to \nfinancial intermediaries. The Project will help strengthen the unit\u2019s capacity and knowledge base in \nthe health sector, in adapting microfinance technologies, and in setting performance benchmarks \nfor the financial intermediaries. Specifically, the technical support will assist the wholesale unit of \nDBP to (i) identify the loan products to be developed and promoted to the financial intermediaries, \nincluding lending parameters and promotion strategy; (ii) identify its wholesale financing modality \nthrough mapping out geographic coverage of the financial intermediaries and its client orientation; \n(iii) identify appropriate microfinance technologies (center versus individual onlending) to support \naffordable interest rates and a guarantee system; and (iv) refine performance benchmarks by \nincluding within them indicators related to health sector lending. \n \n59.  Strengthening Social Marketing. The Project will provide technical support to DBP in \ndeveloping and marketing the health lending product to decision makers and subborrowers\u2014\nLGUs, the eligible private sector, associations, and other relevant organizations.33 The Project, \nunder the Program Development Department of DBP (and in close collaboration with other units at \nDBP  engaged  in  marketing),  will  develop  and  implement  an  active  5-year  social  marketing \nstrategy, including a public information component with appropriate information on the health \nlending product and the project development objectives. The Project will strengthen capacity of the \nDBP\u2019s wholesale unit and the regional marketing centers in preparing curriculum, training, and \nmarketing for the health lending product. DBP\u2019s central and regional units will train the financial \nintermediaries in marketing the Project, in helping subborrowers prepare business proposals, and \nin assessing the health sector market for lending. The units will also monitor health and financial \nperformance of the subborrowers. DBP\u2019s account officers in the branch offices will be trained to \nmarket the health lending product to LGUs and private hospitals. The financial intermediaries (with \nDBP\u2019s oversight) will market the product to private, small-scale health providers and monitor the \nonlending to them.  \n \n60.  Supporting  PHIC  Contractual  Arrangements  with  Subborrowers.  The  project \nsubborrowers will each develop a contractual service relationship with PHIC. Marketing of the \nPHIC benefit packages and accreditation standards will be the responsibility of PHIC. The Project \nwill coordinate closely with PHIC and provide support to the contractual agreement developed \nbetween PHIC and the subborrowers at the time of the lending agreement between DBP and the \nsubborrower. The PHIC legal agreement will stipulate the service package (including beneficiaries, \nservices,  price,  and  reporting)  agreed  between  PHIC  and  the  subborrowers.  The  service \nperformance will be monitored and reported by PHIC to DBP, and there will be discussions on \nactions to be taken in case of noncompliance with the contractual agreement. \n \n                                                 \n33\n Two other mechanisms have been identified by which information is and will be disseminated to the potential \nsubborrowers: (i) DOH is already marketing F1 to the LGUs and providing them information on the various windows of \nfinancing; and (ii) PHIC is to market its benefit packages, which is already partially underway.

DBP has requested a loan of \u00a54,520,780,200 (equivalent to $50 million) from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. DBP is the borrower. The loan is to be \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines under the terms of a guarantee agreement. DBP has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility under these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n ", "16 \n \n63.  The  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  up  to \n$400,000, to be administered by ADB. The grant will finance activities for enhancing midwives\u2019 \nentrepreneurial and financial literacy (under output 3) during the first 2 project years. \n \n64.  DBP is expected to allocate $1.94 million equivalent and will contribute in cash and in kind \ntoward  (i) project  implementation  unit  staffing  and  operations,  including  computers  and  office \nequipment; (ii) monitoring and evaluation; (iii) experts recruited for output 4 or capacity development; \nand (iv) supporting the operations budget for the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee.  \n \n65.  Equity is expected to be $11.02 million equivalent and will come from the sub- or end-\nborrowers. For the private sector, at least 20% of subproject cost will be allocated as equity. For \nLGUs, at least 10% of subproject cost will be allocated as equity. Equity will be in the form of \nworking capital (cash, inventories, and receivables) and in kind (land, buildings, and equipment \nexisting or to be acquired). \n \n66.  DBP proposes to relend 100% of the loan proceeds to its potential subborrowers at market \ninterest rates. DBP will relend to final borrowers for the purposes of civil works, equipment, and \nworking capital. DBP estimates its relending interest rates based on (i) ADB\u2019s lending rate and other \ncharges to DBP, including its lending spread; (ii) the government guarantee fee (quoted as 1%); \n(iii) government foreign exchange risk cover (quoted as 3% as of November 2007); and (iv) DBP\u2019s \nspread, depending on credit rating or social pricing (1.0%\u20132.5%). DBP takes the risk of relending to \nsubborrowers  through  its  retail  relending  window  while  it  shares  the  risk  of  relending  to  final \nborrowers with financial intermediaries through its wholesale relending window. Applications and \ninformation for relending will be submitted to ADB no later than 5 years after the effective date. The \nfinancing arrangements and fund flow charts are in Appendix 7. \n(i)  Retail  lending  terms. Retail lending for collateralized subprojects from $100,000 to \n$5 million equivalent is for LGUs and larger private ventures, including health providers, \nfoundations  and  health  maintenance  organizations,  although  some  small-scale \nsubborrowers may also qualify under this relending modality. DBP\u2019s lending terms are at \nmarket interest rates and the repayment is based on a subproject\u2019s projected cash flows, \nwith a repayment period of up to 15 years for civil works, up to 10 years for equipment, \nup to 5 years for working capital, and a grace period of up to 3 years. Amortization of \nprincipal and interest is on a quarterly basis. \n(ii)  Wholesale lending terms. Wholesale lending is for accredited financial intermediaries \n(including MFIs, rural and thrift banks, cooperatives, and NGOs) who borrow for amounts \nranging from $100,000 to $500,000 equivalent on DBP\u2019s lending terms. Onlending rates \nof  the  financial  intermediaries  are  determined  considering  cost  of  funds,  loan \nadministration  cost,  and  the  credit  risk.  This  also  guides  the  onlending  rate  for  the \nfinancial intermediaries to the subborrowers. The subborrowers are small-scale health \nservices providers, such as midwives, physicians, municipal drug stores, and municipal \ndrug distribution companies, each borrowing in amounts ranging from $1,000 to less than \n$100,000 equivalent. The terms of onlending by financial intermediaries will also depend \non  the  amount  and  whether  or  not  end-borrowers  are  collateralized.  The  expected \nrepayment period is up to 10 years, with a grace period of 6 months to 2 years.  \n \n67.  Free Limit. The first three subloans financed under the loan and any subloans amounting \nto more than $2 million equivalent will be submitted to ADB for review and approval before DBP \napproves the subloan. Subsequent subloans will not require ADB review and approval unless the \nsubloan  is  for  more  than  $2  million  equivalent.  For  subloans  below  or  equal  to  $2  million \nequivalent, DBP will submit to ADB a statement of subloans describing the subproject, amount \napplied, purpose of the subloan, eligibility criteria, plus the terms and condition. Loan review \nmissions will review selected subprojects during implementation. ", "    17 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n68.  Project Organization and Management. DBP is the Executing Agency. It has established \nthe Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee, chaired by the senior vice president of DBP and \nwith  representatives  of  DBP,  DOH,  PHIC,  MDFO,  the  Department  of  Interior  and  Local \nGovernment (DILG), and the private sector. The committee will (i) ensure compliance with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies and regulations, (ii) provide project oversight and guidance, (iii) \noversee completion of DBP\u2019s health investment policy framework for lending in health, (iv) review \nand  decide  upon  lending  to  subprojects  that  deviate  from  meeting  subproject  eligibility,  (v) \ncoordinate  intersectorally  and  interdepartmentally,  (vi)  respond  to  challenges  faced  in  project \nimplementation,  and  (vii)  monitor  and  report  project  performance.  DBP  has  entered  into  an \nagreement with DILG, DOH, PHIC, and MDFO that outlines the objectives, procedures and areas \nfor cooperation, eligibility criteria for borrowers, eligible investment costs, preparation of feasibility \nand capacity development by DOH, flow of funds, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n69.  DBP has set up a project management office (PMO) under its Sustainable Health Care \nInvestment  Program  in  the  Program  Development  Department.  The  PMO  will  function  as  the \nplanning, coordinating, administering, and monitoring unit for project implementation. The PMO will \nalso  review  subproject  proposals,  monitor  their  progress,  and  provide  recommendations  and \nprogress updates. It includes a project director, a project manager, an assistant project manager and \ntwo  project  associates.  The  project  director  will  be  the  officer  responsible  for  overall  project \nexecution, finance, monitoring, and reporting to the committee and ADB. The project manager will be \nresponsible  for  project  implementation.  The  assistant  project  manager,  assisted  by  the  project \nassociates will run day-to-day PMO operations. The PMO will also recruit experts in health systems, \nhospital civil works, hospital environmental and waste management, monitoring and evaluation, \nfinancial management, and legal matters. Other DBP divisions at the central and regional levels will \nprovide necessary support for the effective implementation of the project. The project organizational \nstructure is in Appendix 8. \n \n70.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, from 1 July \n2009 to 30 June 2015. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n71.  Procurement.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Except \nwhere stated otherwise in the procurement plan, procurement undertaken by beneficiaries under \nthe loan will be in accordance with the procedures for loans to financial intermediaries that allows \nfor procurement in accordance with established private sector or commercial practices. For other \ncases identified in the procurement plan, however, national competitive bidding or international \ncompetitive  bidding  may  be  the  specified  form  of  procurement.  The  procedures  followed  for \nnational competitive bidding will be those set forth in the Government Procurement Reform Act \n(Republic Act No. 9184) with clarifications and modifications as described in Appendix 10. Civil \nWorks in excess of $5,000,000 equivalent and contracts for goods (in particular large single items \nor where large quantities of like goods can be grouped together and procured centrally) estimated \nto cost in excess of $1,000,000 equivalent will be procured based on international competitive \nbidding. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n72.  Consulting Services. Consulting services financed by DBP will be engaged to implement \noutput 4. Consulting services will require 84 person-months of national consultants in the areas of \nhealth systems, social marketing, and hospital environmental and medical waste management. \nThe terms of reference for project management and monitoring and output 4 are outlined in \nSupplementary Appendix B. ADB will assist in selecting the consultants. Under the Gender and \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund,  additional  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  to  support \nimplementing gender-relevant activities of output 3. This component will require 90 person-months \n ", "18 \n \nof consulting services, to be sourced through a national health NGO in the areas of community \nhealth, training, and legal matters. The NGO will be chosen using quality- and cost-based selection \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). DBP will engage and administer the consultants.  \n \n73.  Anticorruption Policy. DBP was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nwill require DBP to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering \nactivities or the financing of terrorism and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. The investment documentation between ADB and DBP will further allow ADB to investigate \nany violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n74.  In addition to standard ADB requirements, the Project incorporates several other measures to \ndeter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  Project,  through  DBP  resources,  will  (i)  build \ncapacity within DBP to understand and comply with ADB\u2019s procedures as outlined in the project \nadministration manual; and (ii) in the project communities, widely publicize the existence of the \nintegrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General as a point of contact for allegations of \nfraud, corruption, and abuse in ADB-financed projects through, among others, DBP's project website \nand DBP's marketing and promotional materials. A project website will be developed, to the extent \npermitted  under  the  prevailing  regulations  relating  to  bank  confidentiality  in  the  Philippines,  to \ndisclose information about project matters, including procurement. The consultants will assist DBP in \nestablishing  the  website.  To  encourage  stakeholder  vigilance  as  well  as  ensure  greater \naccountability, a task force established within the PMO shall receive and resolve grievances or act \nupon stakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities. The task force will (i) review and address grievances of \nproject stakeholders, service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; and \n(ii) set threshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively responding to \nthem, and for informing stakeholders about the complaint mechanism. \n \n75.  Disbursement Arrangements. The proceeds of the ADB loan and grant will be disbursed \naccording to  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For civil \nworks using international competitive bidding procedures, loan funds will be disbursed through \ndirect  payment.  To  facilitate  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  expedite  project \nimplementation, DBP will open within 1 month of loan effectiveness, maintain, and manage a \nproject imprest account. The maximum amount to be advanced to the imprest account will not \nexceed 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account, or 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is less. ADB's Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to \nreimburse, liquidate, and replenish the imprest account for eligible expenditures up to $100,000 \nequivalent per individual payment for the loan and $50,000 equivalent for the grant. \n \n76.  Financial  Management  Assessment.  As  part  of  due  diligence,  DBP\u2019s  financial \nmanagement systems and capacity were assessed. DBP exhibits strong financial performance and \nadheres to prudential financial management practices: (i) DBP has a risk-based credit pricing \npolicy that covers market risks, including those for interest rates and foreign exchange. DBP pricing \npolicy for the Project will be guided by the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas [BSP]) internal credit risk rating system standards (adopted in 2004),34 and the individual \nsubborrower\u2019s  rating  will  determine  its  capacity  to  meet  debt  service  requirements.  (ii)  DBP \nadheres to BSP stipulations for a risk-based operational framework on capital adequacy. DBP's \nGovernance  Committee  ensures  adherence  to  its  policies  on  good  governance,  reviews \n                                                 \n34 With BSP Circular 439, banks are required to rate all borrowers with assets of higher than the P1.5 million with an \ninternal credit risk rating system duly approved.   ", "    19 \ntransactions on credit and investment, and conducts periodic performance evaluation of the board \nand its committees. (iii) DBP\u2019s growth in assets, liabilities, and equity reflect its focus on viable \ninvestments,  increased  deposit  mobilization,  and  adherence  to  BSP\u2019s  capital  adequacy \nrequirements, while its performance indicators are evident of its above-industry performance on \ncapital adequacy, return on assets, ratio of liquid assets to deposits, and past-due ratio. DBP \nexpects to operate viably and profitably in the next 5 years by (i) generating more low-cost and \nloan-based funding sources as a primary source of funds for onlending and investments; (ii) \nmaintaining sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawals; (iii) preserving the balance between its \noperating expenses, gross income, and total assets; and (iv) ensuring that its capital adequacy \nindicator meets the BSP requirement. A summary financial management assessment of DBP is in \nAppendix 11, and the due diligence on DBP is detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n77.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  DBP  will  ensure  that  records,  accounts,  and \nrelated  financial  statements  are  adequately  maintained  according  to  accounting  standards  in \naccordance with BSP and likewise acceptable to ADB (Philippine Financial Accounting Standards, \nwhich are based on International Financial Accounting Standards and benchmarks). The reports \nshould identify goods and services financed from loan proceeds. DBP will maintain separate \nproject accounts and will prepare related financial statements, including records for the imprest \naccount and SOE. The Commission on Audit will audit these, and certified copies of such audited \naccounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after \nthe fiscal year to which the report relates. A separate audit opinion on use of the imprest account \nand SOE procedures should be included in the audit report. Delay in submitting audited financial \nstatements of acceptable quality may result in ADB\u2019s suspending loan disbursements. \n \n78.  DBP  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  a  quarterly  report  on  the  operational  and  financial \nperformance  of  project  implementation  within  2  months  after  the  end  of  each  quarter;  (ii)  a \nprojected annual disbursement schedule, broken down quarterly by 15 December each year; (iii) \nan  updated  3-year  financial  projection  for  DBP  by  31  March  each  year;  and  (iv)  a  project \ncompletion report  within  3  months  of  project completion detailing  implementation,  costs, loan \nrecoveries, financial conditions of MFIs, an evaluation of the Project\u2019s impact on the beneficiaries, \nand other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \n79.  DBP will submit reports on the implementation of project-funded activities within 30 days \nafter the end of each quarter. The quarterly reports will include progress made against established \ntargets on the lending portfolio; achievement of milestones; inputs and outputs under the design \nand monitoring framework, with data, graphs and interpretations; problems encountered during the \nquarter; steps taken and proposed to resolve problems; compliance with loan covenants; and \nproject activities to be undertaken during the next quarter. All reports will be submitted in English.  \n \n80.  Environment.  An  environmental  management  assessment  was  carried  out  on  DBP\u2019s \nenvironmental management system (EMS) and on the environmental assessment procedures and \nguidelines as applied to the Project. DBP has a satisfactory EMS with appropriate staff capacity, and \nits environmental policy and environmental assessment procedures are of the same standard as \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). No additional measures are necessary to ensure compliance. As \nDBP\u2019s account officers\u2019 experience with environmental assessment is uneven, DBP will prepare an \nupgraded  training  program  to  ensure  performance  of  uniform  quality.  ADB  will  validate  DBP\u2019s \ncapacity  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  by  reviewing  the  initial \nenvironmental examination for the first two category B subprojects prior to DBP approval. Eligible \ninvestments under the Project will be category B or C. No category A subproject is anticipated, and \ncategory A proposals will be screened out. Impacts of category B subprojects can be mitigated by \nproperly implementing the EMS of the financial intermediary and the government, and additional \nprocedures developed for the specific subproject, and agreed with ADB to ensure environmental \n ", "20 \n \nassessments are equivalent to ADB requirements. DBP will submit a report on the environmental \nstatus of the subprojects every 6 months with information about environmental categories, details, \nand  potential  or  resolved  issues  for  subprojects  under  assessment,  approved,  and  under \nimplementation.  The  environmental  assessment  of  financial  intermediation  loans  and  equity \ninvestments is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n81.  Involuntary  Resettlement.  An  involuntary  resettlement  framework  with  detailed \nprocedures and involuntary resettlement checklist has been prepared by DBP to screen proposed \nsubprojects for involuntary resettlement impact (Supplementary Appendix E). Every LGU and retail \nunit subloan proposal will be screened to ensure all subloan proposals in project sites with titles \ninvolving  liens  and  encumbrances  and  informal  settlement  issues,  including  loss  of  shelter, \nlivelihood,  or  access  to  resources,  are  identified  and  denied.  A  subloan  proposal  screening \nchecklist  for  all  public  and  private  subloan  proposals  has  been  established  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  to  flag  potential  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  In \naddition to the screening checklist, DBP will physically verify that all subproject sites involved in the \npublic  and  private  subloan  proposals  submitted  for  credit  approval  are  free  from  liens  and \nencumbrances, that they have no informal settler impacts, and that no eviction of informal dwellers \nhas been undertaken during the past 12 months prior to loan application. \n \n82.  Indigenous Population. An indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) has been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the  Philippine \nRepublic Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997. It states how compliance will be achieved, \nincluding  the  participation  strategy,  grievance  procedures,  and  institutional  implementation \narrangements. For each type of eligible investment, the IPDF describes the DBP subloan approval \nprocess,  how  the  proposals  will  be  screened,  persons  responsible,  documentation  required, \nimplementation monitoring arrangements, and reporting to ADB. The National Commission on \nIndigenous Peoples (NCIP) regional offices will provide DBP the locations of ancestral domains \nand ancestral lands that have been approved or are under consideration. For project sites that are \nin  approved  ancestral  areas  or  those  under  consideration,  the  IPDF  identifies  the  types  of \ninvestments that may require free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) or an indigenous people \ncommunity  action,  as  well  as  the  actions  to  be  undertaken  by  the  proponent  prior  to  DBP \nconsideration  for  credit  approval.  Few  subloans  requiring  FPIC  or  community  action  are \nanticipated, as most public investments are expected to restore or achieve the service levels \nexpected for existing facilities. Most proponents of private sector investments are likely to be \nindigenous  peoples  or  non-indigenous  people  residents  rather  than  non-indigenous  people \nmigrants. The IPDF is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n83.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework  provides  the  needed  indicators.  DBP  will  oversee  project  performance  and  submit \nquarterly reports to the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee and ADB. To assess impact \nand outcome, DBP will collect information on the use of health facilities including indigent, women, \nand children. All subprojects will require baseline and end-of-project health services surveys to \nassess services improvement in terms of use, quality, affordability, and patient satisfaction. Surveys \nwill be conducted jointly with subproject feasibility studies prior to investment. In addition, DBP, as \nguided by the committee and ADB, will conduct selective qualitative studies to obtain the views of \nstakeholders  on  the  services  and  related  matters.  DBP  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  the \nsurveys, but it may contract this out to a suitable firm or NGO. \n \n84.  Project Review. DBP and ADB will jointly review project progress at least twice a year. They \nwill undertake a midterm review during the third year of implementation. The midterm review will (i) \nreview the scope, design, implementation arrangements, and other relevant issues in light of F1 and \ndevelopment objectives, as well as the Project\u2019s health policy framework; (ii) identify changes since ", "    21 \nthe  time  of  appraisal  relating  to  sector  issues  and  resource  management  and  allocation,  then \nreassess  their  impacts  on  future  subproject  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii) review \nimplementation performance of all outputs; (iv) review progress in achieving the Project\u2019s measurable \nobjectives; (v) identify problems and constraints; and (vi) formulate appropriate recommendations for \ncorrective action. The midterm review will also assess the status of procurement, construction or \nrenovation, and equipment under each category of the eligible subprojects.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n85.  ADB will provide DBP a TA grant for public\u2013private partnership in health services to support \nthe  subborrowers,  including  LGUs  and  private  providers,  in  enhancing  modalities  for  PPP, \nincluding (i) innovative strategies to improve efficiency, access, and quality of services; (ii) assisting \nsmall-scale health providers\u2019 access to credit to support health-related MDGs; and (iii) mobilizing \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs (Appendix 12).\n \n \n86.  Impact and Outcome. The TA\u2019s impact is to help improve the maternal and child health \nstatus by 2015 in the subproject sites using PPP. The outcome of the Project will be tested PPP \nmodalities that will have demonstrated potential to increase the use of maternal and child health \ncare and referral services in the subproject sites with PPP.  \n   \n87.  Methodology and Key Activities. The TA will have three outputs.  \n(i)  Output 1. Develop and promote PPP modalities in the health sector by conducting \nan assessment; assisting to prepare PPP policy, regulations, guidelines, and a \nhandbook; and identifying preliminary PPP health subprojects for potential support.  \n(ii)  Output 2. Develop incentives and operational strategies to encourage small-scale \nhealth providers in attaining PHIC and/or other accreditation for health services in \nrural and underserved areas that address health-related MDGs by identifying and \nproviding incentives for them to work in such areas, and develop partnerships to \nscale up initiatives with project support.  \n(iii)  Output  3.  Develop  and  initiate  the  contracting  modality  for  health  services  to \nimprove quality and efficiency of health services. This initiative has already started \nunder ADB-supported TA.35  \n \n88.  Cost and Financing. The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. DBP \nwill finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent in kind, including office accommodation costs; \ntransport; utilities; seminar room space; remuneration of counterpart staff; plus provision of data, \nreports, and other relevant documents.    \n \n89.  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  is  DBP  (Program \nDevelopment  Department),  and  the  implementing  agencies  are  DOH  (Bureau  of  International \nHealth Cooperation) and PHIC (Health Finance Policy and Service Sector). The TA will be guided \nand monitored by the Health Sector Investment Advisory Committee.    \n \n90.  ADB will recruit a team of international and national consultants to provide specialized \nservices totaling 80 person-months (30 international and 50 national) in the areas of public\u2013private \npartnership in health; finance; legal matters; health systems; procurement; and training. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- \nand cost-based selection, with quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and simplified technical proposals.  \n \n                                                 \n35 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for the Support for Health Sector Reform. Manila \n(TA 4647-PHI). \n ", "22 \n \n91.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in July 2009 and ending by \nDecember 2010. The TA consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of TA start-\nup; (ii) an interim report within 9 months of TA implementation; and (iii) a final report within \n24 months of TA implementation. DBP, DOH, PHIC, ADB, and the consultants\u2019 team will hold \ntripartite meetings during inception, midterm, and on completion of the TA. Key findings and \noutputs of the TA will be disseminated through workshops.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.   Expected Benefits and Impacts \n \n92.  Health  Benefits.  The Project is designed to address MDGs by targeting the poor, in \nparticular women and children with poor health indicators. It specifically addresses gaps in basic \nhealth care, including maternal and child health care, communicable disease control, diagnostic \nservices, and referral services. The Project promotes the use of PHIC-accredited health facilities, \nthereby promoting quality standards of services, and it supports partnership between the public \nand private sectors to address gaps in health care, such as staff shortages for maternal care.  \n \n93.  Social, Gender, and Poverty Benefits. The Project is designed to result in major social, \ngender, and poverty benefits with multiple impacts. A larger proportion of the beneficiaries will be \nthe poor, women, and children. They will benefit from upgrading LGU health facilities and also from \nfilling gaps in service delivery through PPP and support for small providers close to communities. \nOversight arrangements, capacity development, provincial plans, eligibility criteria, and targeted \nfunding for assisting small providers will help to ensure that suitable subprojects are selected that \nyield maximum benefit for these vulnerable groups. The Project also supports PHIC accreditation \nof health providers close to the underserved population. Finally, the Project provides improved \naccess to credit and opportunities for improved earnings for small-scale health providers, who are \noften female (midwives, drug store owners). The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13, and the gender and development action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \n94.  Financial Protection of the Poor. The poor will benefit (i) through reduced costs for care \nand transport, plus greater opportunity to receive care, as facilities become more accessible; (ii) \nfrom increased subsidy from PHIC-accredited health facilities, including generic drug outlets, and \n(iii) indirectly, through better health resulting in less income erosion and increased productivity. \n \n95.  Economic Benefits. The subprojects will address (i) externalities, such as through primary \nhealth care; (ii) merit goods, such as through direct impact on woman and child health, reduction in \nunnecessary use of hospitals, and better information to consumers; (iii) uncertainty, such as due to \ncomplications during childbirth; and (iv) inequity in access. The Project will promote both technical \n(e.g.,  access  to  affordable  generic  drugs)  and  allocative  (e.g.,  access  to  cost-effective \ninterventions) efficiencies. It is expected to have a significant impact on the poor, particularly women \nand  children.  A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was  undertaken  on  two  subgroups  (i)  infants  and \nparticularly neonates; and (ii) women of childbearing age, particularly those who are pregnant. The \nassumption is that as access to credit increases, and health care providers are accredited, more \nwomen will deliver under health care providers. This will result in healthier women and newborns. \nThe Project could therefore essentially bring down maternal and neonatal deaths in the subproject \nsites. While the analysis focuses on infant and maternal deaths, many of these interventions should \nalso reduce infant and maternal distress and morbidity. Consequently, total health benefits, as \nmeasured by a composite measure such as disability-adjusted life years, would be significantly \ngreater. In the 15th year from the start of the investment, the Project will maximize net benefits \naccruing to the country (positive net present value) and the internal rate of return will surpass the \ndiscount rate. An economic and financial sustainability analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n ", "    23 \n96.  Financial Sustainability. Analyses were undertaken to assess the financial sustainability of \nsubprojects, and these were broken down to (i) retail lending subprojects, and (ii) wholesale lending \nsubprojects. An actual case of a LGU provincial hospital expansion was taken from one province. \nAdditionally, for wholesale lending, actual costs and estimated incomes were considered for small-\nscale health providers, such as midwives, obstetricians, and drug stores. The financial sustainability \nanalysis was determined by using weighted average cost of capital and financial internal rate of return \nestimates for each subproject, and composite financial internal rate of return for the Project. The \nanalysis suggests that the Project is generally financially sustainable. However, LGU hospitals, which \nare not income-generating entities and generally rely on LGUs cross-subsidization, under the current \nbudget scenario are dependent on PHIC reimbursements for sustained operation expenditures. There \nis risk of increase in balance billing, as hospitals may try to increase user fees (charged to patients) in \nresponse to their increased capital investment. The subprojects will mitigate this risk by contracting \nwith PHIC, which stipulates hospital charges for its beneficiaries. Most small-scale subprojects were \nfinancially sustainable, although the sensitivity analysis suggests that they could be vulnerable if \nrevenue generation is delayed.  \n \nB.   Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigating Measures \n \n97.  Key  assumptions  for  successful  implementation  are  (i)  adequate  recurrent  and  capital \nbudgets by Government and LGUs for health-related programs, (ii) enrollment of indigents and the \npoor  into  PHIC,  (iii)  provider  access  to  a  comprehensive  PHIC  benefits  and  reimbursements \npackage, and (iv) LGUs and private health entrepreneurs are willing and able to borrow at DBP\u2019s \n(or financial intermediaries\u2019) terms. Some risks and mitigating measures are given below. \n \n98.  Delayed Implementation of F1. To date, DOH has mobilized 37 out of the 78 provinces to \nachieve F1 and it plans to cover all by 2010. If the mobilization of LGUs or the preparation of LGU \ninvestments  is  delayed,  project  disbursement  will  be  delayed.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  DBP,  in \npartnership  with  DOH  and  DILG,  will  need  to  ensure  the  timely  mobilization  of  LGUs  and \npreparation of the subproject feasibility studies.   \n \n99.  Limited Experience in the Health Sector. While DBP has established a new credit facility \nfor health development projects, it has limited experience in the health sector. Its experience has \nprimarily been in large-scale private projects, where it was not necessary to provide TA or whose \nperformance  could  easily  be  monitored.  DBP  is  well-versed  with  financial  management  and \nassessing creditworthiness. DBP will also need to market its new lending product to generate \ndemand among LGU and small-scale subborrowers. DBP will obtain expertise in the health sector \nand form partnerships with other key agencies\u2014DOH and MDFO in particular. Under the LGU \ncredit policy framework, DBP and MDFO form an alliance in lending to LGUs.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n100.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the DBP have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. The DBP will ensure that:  \n(i)  DBP will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on time and will prepare \nannual plans for subproject investment and for loan disbursement. Every year, DBP \nwill submit the annual plan to ADB for endorsement not later than the first quarter of \nthe year; \n(ii)  DBP will ensure that it maintains (a) a capital adequacy ratio of 10% or above, (b) a \nminimum return on average total assets of 0.5%, and (c) a minimum liquid assets \n ", "24 \n \nratio36 of 25%;  \n(iii)  DBP  will  conduct  financial  due  diligence  on  the  subborrowers  prior  to  subloan \napproval,  monitoring  during  subproject  implementation  and  evaluation  after  the \nsubproject is completed;  \n(iv)  DBP will ensure a baseline study as part of the feasibility study of each subproject. \nThe indicators will include those from the design and monitoring framework and \naddress issues of equity. The study will be conducted during and no later than the first \n3  months  of  subproject  approval.  DBP  will  also  conduct  an  exit  study  for  each \nsubproject  and  report  the  same  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  the  subproject\u2019s \ncompletion.  DBP's  Program  Evaluation  Department  will  conduct  a  beneficiaries\u2019 \nimpact  assessment  study.  In  furtherance  to  these,  DBP  will  ensure  that  (a)  the \nappropriate budget will be allocated by DBP and/or its subborrowers to support the \nstudies; (b) the studies will be conducted in accordance with the terms of reference \ndeveloped for such purpose; and (c) the results and findings of the studies will be \nshared with ADB;  \n(v)  DBP will ensure that subloan proposals requiring an FPIC are monitored to ensure \ncompliance with the project IPDF, Republic Act No. 8371 on Indigenous Peoples \nRights (1997), and the NCIP Administrative Order 1/2006 on the FPIC guidelines of \n2006. When an FPIC is required, DBP will not approve any subloan or subproject until \nthe  NCIP  issues  a  Certificate  of  Precondition  attesting  that  all  FPIC  guideline \nrequirements have been met. Information on geographic location of existing and \nproposed  Indigenous  People's  Ancestral  Domains  and  Lands  used  for  FPIC \ncompliance requirements will be updated regularly, and periodic monitoring of subloan \nimplementation will be undertaken to ensure FPIC agreements are met; \n(vi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, DBP will establish a website to disclose \nproject-related information. To the extent permitted under the Government\u2019s banking \nregulation relevant to confidentiality, DBP will disclose all relevant information with \nregard to the project activities, including the subprojects and the stakeholders; \n(vii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, DBP will design and approve a grievance \nredress mechanism, acceptable to ADB, and establish a task force at the PMO. \nThe task force shall receive and resolve complaints and grievances or act upon \nreports from stakeholders on misuse of funds and other irregularities, including \ngrievances caused by resettlement and environmental issues. The task force will \n(a) make public the existence of this grievance redress mechanism through a public \nawareness campaign in every area where there is a subproject; (b) review and \naddress grievances of stakeholders in relation to the Project, any of the service \nproviders, or any person responsible for carrying out any aspect of the Project; and \n(c) proactively and constructively respond to them;  \n(viii)  DBP will ensure that subborrowers and subprojects will be selected in accordance \nwith the agreed eligibility criteria, as set out in Appendix 5; \n(ix)  DBP  will  ensure  that  the  activities  included  in  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund-financed component for enhancing midwives\u2019 entrepreneurial and \nfinancial literacy are carried out during the first 2 years of project implementation. \nDBP will closely monitor, and the progress will be reported in the quarterly reports to \nADB;  \n(x)  DBP will (a) ensure that it will not approve any subloan proposal that involves \ninvoluntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995);  (b)  ensure  and  certify  compliance  with  the  involuntary  resettlement \n                                                 \n36 Cash on hand; checks and other cash items due from the central bank and other banks; marketable securities, trading \naccount securities, government securities with maturities of less than 1 year or more than 1 year, which can be traded \nin the secondary market; interbank loans receivable with a maturity of less than 1 year to total deposits.

The Sector \n \n1.  The Government of the Philippines and its partners need to close the gap in access to \nhealth care, especially for the poor and for those in the rural areas, in order to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and ensure timely and adequate response to changing \nmorbidity patterns in the country. This appendix summarizes the sector, what can be done to \nclose the gap, and the role of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).  \n \n2.  Filipinos\u2019 life expectancy at birth is 71 years (2005) on average, but remote provinces \nhave much lower life expectancies.1 The country has a mixed status on the health-related \nMDGs. The Philippines National Statistics Office reports that the infant mortality rate (IMR) had \nsteadily declined to 31 infant deaths per 1,000 live births by 2004, and the maternal mortality \nratio (MMR) was at 200 per 100,000 live births in 2000 and 108 in 2003. Both IMR and MMR \nare higher in the Visayas and Mindanao compared to Luzon. The MMR is much higher in Bicol, \nLeyte, and Samar. Maternal and child deaths in remote areas are likely to be underreported. \nThe IMR for children whose mothers have no education is 65 deaths per 1,000 live births \ncompared with 15 deaths per 1,000 live births for children whose mothers have college or \nhigher education. Although the MMR also shows major disparities by income status, it remains \nrelatively high, too, among the more affluent, thus demonstrating that this is not just a matter of \naccess and affordability but also one of quality of care.   \n \n3.  Noncommunicable diseases (like asthma, heart diseases, hypertension, and cancers) \nhave been increasing, causing early morbidity, disability, and mortality as well as a drain on \nhealth care resources. Long existent and treatable infectious diseases are reemerging and \nbecoming more difficult to treat because of increased vulnerability and drug resistance. New \ninfectious  diseases  are  emerging  (human  immunodeficiency  virus  [HIV],  severe  acute \nrespiratory  syndrome,  avian  influenza).  HIV  prevalence  has  increased  slowly,  although  it \nremains concentrated in high risk groups. \n \n4.  Immediate attention is required to the slow progress in attaining the health-related MDGs \nand  to improve  prevention  and early  curing  of incapacitating  diseases.  The  large  regional \ndisparities point to the need for giving specific attention to deprived regions and to the deprived \nand vulnerable categories of the population (in rural areas and urban slums).  \n \n5.  The Philippines has a dual health system of largely tax-financed public health services at \nnational and local levels plus an extensive for-profit and nonprofit private sector that is largely \nfinanced from user fees. Social health insurance has been introduced and is being expanded \ngradually as a way of pooling risk, establishing accreditation, and contracting services. This is \nexpected to improve access for the poor and vulnerable, although the range of reimbursable \nservices and access to quality services remain limited.       \n \n6.  Public  health  services  are  provided  by  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH),  local \ngovernment units (LGUs), and other agencies (e.g., the military). DOH provides national health \npolicies, plans, standards, and guidelines. DOH at central level comprises the Secretary\u2019s office \nand five clusters for sector management, internal management, regulation, external affairs, and \nlocal health programs. DOH has three zonal health offices headed by undersecretaries and \nmandated to implement the national health objectives, the Local Government Code, and the \nhealth sector reform agenda. It operates 16 centers for health development\u2014one in each \n                                                 \n1 Department of Health. 2005. National Objectives of Health. Manila.  ", "Appendix 2  31 \nregion\u2014and  supports  provincial  health  offices  through  provincial  health  teams.  DOH  also \noperates about 70 national, regional, and specialty hospitals.  \n \n7.  The  Philippines  Health  Insurance  Corporation  (PHIC)  is  a  government-owned  and \ncontrolled  corporation  attached  to  DOH.  It  is  mandated  to  administer  the  national  health \ninsurance program and ensure that Filipinos have affordable access to health services. The \nprivate health sector includes clinics, hospitals, insurance companies, manufacturers of drugs \nand equipment, training institutes, and other entities.  \n \n8.  LGUs finance and operate provincial and district hospitals, while municipal governments \nrun rural health units (RHUs) and barangay health stations (BHSs). Every LGU has a health \nboard to advise the executive on health care system development. In 2002, there were about \n661 government hospitals (up from 413 in 1980) and 1,077 private hospitals (down from 1,194 \nin 1980). The bed capacity declined in this period from 18.2 to 10.7 beds per 10,000 people. As \nwould be expected, most hospital beds are in the National Capital Region and the least in the \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. An RHU serves about 40,000 people and a BHS \nabout 5,000. The number of RHUs declined from 1,962 in 1986 to 1,879 in 2001, and the \nnumber of BHSs increased from 9,184 in 1988 to 15,343 in 2002.                   \n \n9.  In 2002, LGUs employed 3,021 doctors, 1,871 dentists, 4,720 nurses, 16,534 midwives, \n3,271  engineers,  1,505  medical  technologists,  and  other  staff.  There  were  also  195,928 \nbarangay health volunteers and 54,557 birth attendants (footnote 1). The Philippines is among \nthe biggest exporters of nurses and doctors, leading to staff shortages and quality constraints. \nFilipinos have high per capita spending on medicines, totaling about half of total spending on \nhealth care. The market is dominated by expensive branded medicines.  \n \n10.  While  the  Philippines  health  care  system  is  generally  extensive,  access  to  health \nservices\u2014particularly by the poor\u2014is hampered by high costs plus physical and sociocultural \nbarriers. The health care system has gone through several reforms, including the adoption of \nprimary health care approach in 1979, integration of public health and hospital services in 1983, \ndevolution of health services to LGUs in 1991, and enactment of the National Health Insurance \nAct in 1995 that included the nonformal sector. In 1999, DOH launched the health sector reform \nagenda to improve the delivery, regulation, and financing of the sector.  \n \n11.  Fourmula One for Health (F1) is DOH\u2019s implementation framework for health sector \nreforms for the medium term covering 2005\u20132010. It is directed to achieving better health \noutcomes, a more responsive health care system, and more equitable health care financing in a \nmanner that is felt and appreciated by Filipinos, especially the poor. This is consistent with the \nhealth system goals identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), the MDGs, and the \nmedium-term Philippine development plan. FI has four specific medium-term objectives:  \n(i)  secure more, better, and sustained financing for health;  \n(ii)  assure the quality and affordability of health goods and services;  \n(iii)  ensure access to and availability of essential and basic health packages; and \n(iv)  improve performance of the health system.  \n \n12.  F1 is designed to implement critical health interventions as a single package, backed by \neffective management infrastructure and financing arrangements. It engages the entire health \nsector,  including  the  public  and  private  sectors,  national  agencies  and  LGUs,  external \ndevelopment agencies, and civil society to get involved in the implementation of health reforms.  \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 2   \nB.  Main Issues \n \n13.  The current system is fragmented in its organization and management, in its services, \nand in financing. In effect, a two-tier system exists: the private sector for the rich (mainly located \nin the cities) and the public system for the poor. Health system funding shows a problematic mix \nthat is part national health system, part social health insurance system, and combined with a \nhalfway devolved system providing mandates for regulating and financing the sector to DOH, \nLGUs, and PHIC (all of which deal with the same health service providers, both publicly and \nprivately owned). The public system lacks funding, instruments for stewardship and regulatory \ncapacity, enforcement and effective use of existing regulation, and incentives for health care \nproviders.  There  are  major  challenges\u2014but  also  opportunities\u2014in  improving  access, \naffordability, quality, management, and financing of health services.  \n \n1.  Access  \n14.  A 2003 survey identified problems of financial, geographic, and cultural access to health \ncare.2 Better health services were characterized as follows (i) health professional are reliable, \n(ii) drugs and diagnostic equipment are available, and (iii) the building is clean and people are \ntreated with dignity. People equate good staff attitude and cleanliness with quality care, which is \noften seen as lacking in public health services. Availability of free or inexpensive (generic) drugs \nis appreciated but patients have more confidence in branded drugs. Demand for preventive \nhealth care is low. Use of traditional healers is still widely practiced before and after visiting a \nmodern clinic.  \n \n15.  According to the same survey (footnote 2), facility-based deliveries increased from 34% \nin the 5 years preceding 1998 to 38% in the 5 years preceding the 2003 survey. Sixty percent of \nbirths in the 5 years before the 2003 survey were assisted by health professionals (34% by a \ndoctor and 26% by a midwife or a nurse) compared with 56% in the 5 years preceding the 1998 \nsurvey (footnote 2). WHO recommends that every delivery should take place in a well-equipped \nhealth facility, and be led by a health professional. Regional variation ranges from fewer than \n40% of births assisted by health professionals in Bicol, Caraga, and Autonomous Region in \nMuslim Mindanao to over 80% in Central Luzon and the National Capital Region. Importantly, in \n38% of cases of maternal death there was no medical attendance.  \n \n16.  The use of services is slightly higher for public health services and quite evenly spread \nacross the country, although slightly higher in urban areas. A major problem is the bypassing of \npublic facilities or going straight to tertiary care facilities when primary or secondary care would \nhave been sufficient. This is due to the perceived low quality of care and unavailability of \nmedicines. Many government hospitals have inadequate budgetary support and managerial \nautonomy after devolution. Private services are perceived to offer better quality care, to be \nsimilar in terms of access, but to be more costly. Public health services are more often used by \nthe poor who cannot afford private services. \n \n17.  District hospitals, although classified as secondary hospitals, are often structured as \nprimary care hospitals (under 50 beds), and they offer limited specialist and diagnostic services. \nProvincial hospitals are structured as secondary care hospitals, have specialist and diagnostic \nservices  with  limited  capacity,  but  are  located  in  larger  towns  and  cities.  Nongovernment \nsecondary care hospitals are mostly located in urban areas. Most hospital beds are in urban \ntertiary hospitals. The current PHIC-operated accreditation system creates an incentive for \n                                                 \n2 National Statistics Office. 2003. National Demographic and Household Survey. Manila ", "Appendix 2  33 \ndeveloping tertiary hospitals. Nongovernment-owned hospitals, therefore, prefer to identify their \nstatus as \u201ctertiary,\u201d because they are then automatically accredited (while other hospital levels \nneed to be operational for at least 3 years) and receive higher reimbursement for inpatient care \nfrom PHIC compared to other hospital levels. The upgrading to tertiary hospitals is not needs-\nbased.  The  health  care  delivery  system  should  be  refined  with  appropriate  incentives  to \nencourage secondary care services in rural areas with referral links and to prevent unnecessary \nupgrading  of  secondary  to  tertiary  hospitals.  Appropriate  incentives,  such  as  through  a \ngatekeeping program combined with higher copayments for non-referred patients, could prevent \npatients from bypassing primary care clinics and reduce unnecessary hospital care and costs. \nThis cannot happen, however, without upgrading lower level health services providers, like \nRHUs, to support necessary changes in behavior and preferences of patients and providers. \n \n2.  Affordability \n18.  Some 33% of Filipinos are classified as poor, while 20% of the urban population and 47% \nof the rural people are poor. Almost half of health care costs are paid out-of-pocket, while PHIC \ncontributes only 10% of these costs.3 Fees for services may deter the poor from seeking health \nservices at all or may cause greater poverty, indebtedness, and loss of land. The poor will often \nnot be able to afford basic health care (and therefore often delay care until it is too late, which \nparticularly affects children). Also, the nonpoor may find it difficult to pay for catastrophic and \nchronic care. If not deferring treatment, families use other strategies to meet their health care \nneeds,  including  self-medication,  sharing  medicine,  and  going  into  debt  for  severe  illnesses \n(including for terminal illnesses of the elderly). Given high levels of unemployment and prevailing \nsocial structures, income generators may also end up in poverty while caring for dependents.  \n \n19.  Drugs constitute half of health expenditures. Except for the indigent, PHIC does not yet \noffer reimbursement for outpatient drugs. The absence of such reimbursement may be cause \nfor unnecessary hospital admission, not only because of forgone prevention opportunities but \nalso simply to obtain medicines inside a hospital that are unaffordable to patients in outpatient \ncare. DOH is addressing this issue by gradually expanding access to simple drugstores via its \nsystem of botika ng barangay (community-managed drug outlets), which offer a limited variety \nof essential drugs at low prices procured via international competitive bidding by Philippine \nInternational Trading Corporation.  \n \n3.  Quality of Care \n20.  There  is  no  accountability  for  quality  of  services  provided  at  health  facilities.  The \nPhilippines  has  licensing  (through  DOH)  and  an  accreditation  program  (through  PHIC)  for \nhospitals and other health care facilities, and the PHIC reports that about 90% of all hospitals \nand 40% of all rural health clinics are accredited. However, the PHIC accreditation program \ncurrently does not meet international standards. PHIC accreditation standards are more or less \nlike the licensing program of DOH\u2014aiming for the facility to have the minimum inputs needed to \nfunction (human resources and equipment) but not looking at hospitals  more comprehensively \n(in terms of organization and systems). Further, many hospitals that should qualify for a higher \nlevel of care are unable to meet the standards and are therefore accredited for a lower level of \ncare  (e.g.,  secondary  rather  than  tertiary).  This  is  due  to  requirements  for  infrastructure, \nequipment, or human resource not being met. \n \n21.  Accreditation standards complying with international requirements will be introduced in \n                                                 \n3 National Statistics Office. 2005. Philippines National Health Accounts. Manila. \n ", "34  Appendix 2   \n2009. These will be accompanied by a set of quality indicators that can be used for monitoring \nperformance and eventually to be combined for selecting providers as preferred providers to \nenter into favorable contracts with PHIC. To meet the new accreditation and quality standards, \nhospitals will need to invest into the necessary equipment and infrastructure, as well as to \ncomply with a host of other measures that include improving human resources, plus developing \nand implementing more clinical practice guidelines and clinical pathways. Licensing of health \ncare professionals in essence grants a lifelong pass to deliver health services, because merely \nattending mandatory postgraduate training courses is sufficient for being relicensed. \n \n22.  The Philippines has to face a national shortage of physicians and nurses, as many leave \nthe country to work elsewhere. There is an apparent lack of coordinated incentives to keep \nessential health staff in the country, and especially in rural areas. The DOH-supported \u201cDoctors \nto the Barrios\u201d program is a good initiative. Medical students have their studies subsidized by \nDOH on condition that they work for 2 years in the barrios. It is a successful program, but it is \nsmall scale and most doctors leave the barrios after their mandatory 2 years of service.  \n \n23.  Doctors  and  pharmacists  seem  to  have  an  interest  in  prescribing  and  dispensing \nbranded drugs instead of generics. PHIC has no instruments\u2014such as contracting\u2014to exercise \ncontrol over prescribing and dispensing drugs. While markets are not working and third party \nhealth care payers are not effective, a more active market regulatory policy by the Government \ncould bring more balance to the market while stimulating real competition on price and quality.  \n \n24.  Pharmacies are regulated to assure the delivery of safe drugs to the patient, but the \ndistribution  of  pharmacies  across  the  country  is  not  regulated.  This  may  cause  access \nproblems. In addition, antitrust regulation is absent or insufficiently used, leaving the drugs \ndistribution to a few wholesalers and with consequences for the distribution of low-cost drugs. \nDOH  is  trying  to  solve  this  problem  by  stimulating  the  establishment  of  20,000  botika  ng \nbarangay by 2015 that would offer generic essential drugs.  \n \n4.  Management \n25.  On the national and LGU levels, the country lacks adequate instruments for stewardship \nand insufficient regulatory and enforcement capacity for planning and distribution of health care \nresources, for provider performance review, and for quality assurance. As a consequence, \nmany small (less than 50 beds) hospitals (most of these doctor- or family-owned) have difficulty \ncoping with requirements for quality and continuity of care. While some hospitals have high \noccupancy rates, are overcrowded, and need to place beds in corridors, others have very low \noccupancy rates and very short length of stay. This points to an ill-conceived and ill-planned \nsystem. DOH is working in its health reform program, together with selected provinces, to \ndevelop provincial investment plans for health. These plans (for which financing is essential) \nshould facilitate targeted investments and better access to upgraded health care facilities.  \n \n26.  Public and private hospitals and clinics often lack managerial capacity, primarily because \nthe facilities are run not by trained management specialists but by clinical staff. In addition, \nappropriate hardware  and software are not installed for information management, financial \nmanagement, claims processing, patient management, and patient record keeping. That means \nfinancial and quality auditing are more difficult and costly. The lack of inventory systems also \nresults in poor drug management and dangerous stock-outs. The system inefficiencies have \nbeen costly. Alternative options need to be explored, including to strengthen in-house capacity \nfor management or outsourcing to third parties. A DOH initiative to train health managers \ncontributes to solving the problems, but it is on a too-small scale. ", "Appendix 2  35 \n27.  Some  nongovernment  hospitals  are  outsourcing  medical  waste  management, \nhousekeeping,  security,  payment  claims  processing,  and  medical  and  office  equipment \nmaintenance. The company Philam, for example, provides claims processing services to health \nmaintenance organizations. The Philippine training institutions produce adequate skills in the \nareas of management, information technology, and accounting, but such skills have not been \nsufficiently  tapped  for  outsourcing  public  sector  institutional  or  health  facility  management. \nBenefits from economies of scale may be realized by outsourcing support and ancillary services \nfrom government and nongovernment health facilities.  \n \n28.  Although the devolution of power and stewardship functions in the health sector to the \nLGUs has its good aspects (such as better involvement and catering to local health needs), \ndevolution has made it difficult to implement national policies and health objectives. DOH has \nonly advisory power vis-\u00e0-vis the LGUs on some of the issues critical for the proposed DBP \nhealth care investment program. The LGUs have limited capacity and means for adequately \ndirecting the health sector in their areas and for managing the health care facilities under their \nresponsibility. Implementing rationalization of health services in the provinces has proven to be \ndifficult, despite the support of DOH. LGUs do not always take into account the capacity of the \nprivate sector and sometimes do not have data on its distribution, function, and capacity. \nExclusion of the private sector from the planning exercise may, in the absence of planning data \nfrom the private sector, lead to distorted provincial investment plans for health.  \n     \n5.  Financing  \n29.  About 3.4% of gross domestic product is spent on health (footnote 3). That is low \ncompared with the WHO-advised level of 5% for middle-income countries. The larger part of this \nis spent on tertiary hospital services. The public tends to bypass lower facilities and access \ntertiary hospitals even for relatively minor problems. The funding arrangements make it difficult \nto regulate the sector by financial means.  \n \n30.  The country has not made a clear choice for either a budget-funded system, eventually \nto be combined with devolution to LGUs, or an insurance-funded system. Mandated pooling of \nfunding and, subsequently, a single-payer system do not exist. This leads to fragmentation of \nboth funding and of care, with subsequent administrative and health care inefficiencies. In such \na fragmented system, none of the government bodies has sufficient regulatory enforcement or \nfinancial clout to effectively and efficiently govern the system of public and private providers.  \n \n31.  Health care is financed by multiple payers and from at least four different main sources: \nthe national budget (16.7%), the LGU budget (17.5%), PHIC (9.5%), private insurers, and \nprivate out-of-pocket spending at the point of service (48%).  \n \n32.  PHIC funding is also out of balance. While the national health insurance system is \ncompulsory, it effectively coverings only 75% of the population. It has difficulty enrolling the rich, \nsuch as the self-employed like lawyers and doctors. PHIC tries to expand the enrollment of the \npoor via an LGU-sponsored program for the indigent. Formal employers and employees pay \nincome-dependent contributions, while the informal sector pays a flat and comparably low \npremium of P1,200 per year to allow the poor to become members of PHIC. Overseas foreign \nworkers and their dependents in the Philippines pay an even lower premium of P900 per year. \n \n33.  As there is little or no coordination between these various sources of funding, there \nexists  none  of  the  potential  leverage  that  a  single-payer  system  could  have  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \nproviders.  Assessing  the  performance  of  health  care  providers  is  difficult\u2014and  scarcely \n ", "36  Appendix 2   \nattempted\u2014as they are paid from many different sources and patients are free to choose \nproviders (not being bound to use the nearest providers).  \n \n34.  Moreover, current payment systems are not well tuned to act as incentives for providing \ncare efficiently and at the right level of care. The current fee-for-service system for specialists \nencourages specialists to eagerly accept and keep patients and then to do as much as possible \nfor each. Meanwhile, the existing financing for public primary health care is no incentive for \ndoing as much as possible at the primary care level. The absence of a referral system further \ncontributes to the inappropriate use of care at an unnecessarily high level. Not all LGUs appear \nto transfer their agreed health budgets in full, or they pass the PHIC-received payments to the \nproviders, thus sometimes prompting the staff (like midwives) to leave the public sector and go \ninto private practice. PHIC has no insight into the funds flows of LGUs, and there is no external \naudit or accountability of the LGUs (e.g., as regards their fully transferring 70% of the capitation \nfor enrolling indigent people in PHIC). \n \n35.  The current reimbursement in PHIC\u2019s fee-for-service system leaves little possibility for \ncontrolling the volume of services and leads to over-servicing by the health care providers. This \nmay eventually be to the detriment of patients\u2019 health, and it will certainly lead to draining away \nscarce resources. Legally and practically, therefore, PHIC has no effective relationship with \n(especially) the private providers other than through the accreditation system to influence the \nquality of care. It is considering, however, to introduce a contracting system together with a \ncase-based payment system, but only for inpatient care. If properly monitored and if the case-\nbased payment system is capped by a maximum budget per hospital, this may alleviate some of \nthe counterproductive incentives and supply-induced demand.  \n \n36.  While funding constraints result in the health system\u2019s insufficiently responding to the \npopulation\u2019s preventive and curative health needs, PHIC nevertheless has rather high financial \nreserves that are unnecessary for assuring its solvency and which could be easily and wisely \nspent in the sector.  \n \nC.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n37.  To close the gap in access to health care, several measures are needed, including the \nfollowing: \n(i)  Investing in civil works and medical equipment, which should be accompanied by \nadequate marketing of the upgraded services to the population that could profit \nfrom these services. Such investments would further need to be supported by \nhuman resources management and incentives for health staff to work, or to \ncontinue working, in the newly built or equipped health care facilities. \n(ii)  Reforming the health care financing system by making a choice for a budget-\nfunded system or a health insurance-funded system, thereby creating a single-\npayer system, together with giving autonomy to public hospitals that can enter \ninto contracts with either PHIC or regional health authorities.  \n(iii)  Creating a regulatory environment conducive to transparency in both financing \nand  health  care  performance  while  providing  performance  monitoring  for \nproviders to ensure access to care, quality of care, and value for money.  \n(iv)  Introducing an effective referral system via PHIC staff acting as gatekeepers, \naccompanied by higher copayments when seeking higher levels of care without \nreferral (except in accidents and specific emergencies) to ensure that patients \nmake effective use of existing and upgraded facilities,  ", "Appendix 2  37 \n(v)  Supporting this referral system by creating vertical networks of health service \nproviders that also foster and promote cooperation and adequate information \nexchange by professionals as to the various levels of care. There should also be \nmarketing  targeted  to  families  and  patients  to  inform  them  about  the  newly \navailable services, the kinds of services on offer, and their benefits for a person\u2019s \nhealth. \n  \n38.  Creating Investment Opportunities. Unfortunately, DOH\u2019s funds for investment are \nrather limited, and there is no possibility for further borrowing. Going to commercial banks is not \nan option for most health care providers, due to high interest rates and the lack of collateral. \nDBP has a legal mandate and, in principle, the capacity to provide relatively easy access to \ninvestment funds for the health sector, and particularly for those segments where access to \ncredit is a concern. DBP is well positioned to reach its clients, given that (i) it has development \nknowledge in general and the potential to increase its understanding of the health sector; (ii) it \nhas in-house general expertise in marketing, albeit insufficient knowledge of social marketing \ndirected to the health sector; and (iii) it has access to potential borrowers in cities and towns but \nwill need to make an effort to reach out to the rural areas or areas outside of the main urban \ncenters. \n ", "38  Appendix 3   \nPHILIPPINES CREDIT POLICY FRAMEWORK OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS \n \n1.  The  credit  policy  framework  of  local  government  units  (LGUs)  guides  government \nfinancial institutions (GFIs) and the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) on how to \nprovide their financial and technical assistance to LGUs. It comprises four clusters based on \nLGU creditworthiness and the types of projects to be undertaken.  \n(i)  Creditworthy LGUs with revenue-generating projects can be funded mostly from \nprivate sources of capital or GFIs (own funds).  \n(ii)  Marginally or non-creditworthy LGUs with revenue-generating projects can be \nfunded from GFI loans and limited MDFO loans.  \n(iii)  Creditworthy LGUs undertaking social and environmental projects whose returns \nare low or long in coming could be allowed to tap longer-term, lower-cost official \ndevelopment assistance funds through loans from GFIs or MDFO.  \n(iv)  Marginally  or  non-creditworthy  LGUs  with  social  and  environmental  projects \ncould  be  assisted  by  loans  and  grants  from  MDFO  in  accordance  with  the \napproved policy of the National Economic and Development Authority Investment \nCoordination Committee.  \nIn short, for health projects, LGUs have a choice of seeking credit from GFIs or MDFO, and \nthose LGUs that are creditworthy are expected to gravitate toward GFIs.  \n \n2.  Where credit is not easily accessible for long-term investments from the private financial \nmarkets, the Government offers LGUs alternate public sourced of credit through MDFO,1 the \nGFIs,2 and  the  multilateral-  or  bilateral-financed  projects  of  the  central  Government.  The \nGovernment has a comprehensive credit policy framework for LGUs under which the lower \nfiscal capacity LGUs rely on national government support through ongranting; the lower-to-\nmedium fiscal capacity LGUs (at all levels, but especially LGU levels 3\u20136) are eligible to borrow \nfrom MDFO, which provides a combination of loans and grants, as MDFO policies are pro-poor \nand it is willing to offer credit even without LGUs showing their creditworthiness; and the \nmedium-to-higher fiscal capacity LGUs (levels 1\u20132) and city-based projects, along with those \nthat can show their creditworthiness, rely on GFIs or, in a few cases, are able to access private \ncapital through municipal bond flotation.3  \n                                                 \n1  The ADB loan for the Health Sector Development Program is one such loan that finances LGUs through MDFO for \nhealth care investment, but the second-generation funds are limited to about P6 billion and are available for all \nsectors and for all LGUs.

GFIs have an advantage in the \nLGU credit market because of their role as LGU depository banks, while MDFO has access to internal revenue \nallotment intercept mechanism in the event of a loan default. As of end-December 2004, the Land Bank of the \nPhilippines had approved a total of P45.3 billion in loans to LGUs.

", "Appendix 11  53 \nSUMMARY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT  \nDEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (DBP)  was  created  in  1986  pursuant  to \nExecutive Order No. 81 dated 3 December 1986, as amended by Republic Act No. 8523 , as a \ngovernment financing institution aimed at providing credit facilities for the development and \nexpansion of Philippine agriculture and industry. It had an initial capitalization of P5.0 billion. \n \n2.  In 1995, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas  [BSP])  granted  DBP  an  expanded  banking  license,  to  that  of  a  universal  bank,1 \nauthorizing a broad range of wholesale and retail credit facilities. DBP serves as a conduit for \ninternational funds from multilateral sources and bilateral institutions for official development \nassistance programs and grants. \n \n3.  Republic Act No. 8523 of February 1998 aimed to promote the bank\u2019s growth, stability, \nand long-term viability by (i) increasing DBP\u2019s authorized capital stock from P5 billion to P35 \nbillion, (ii) creating the position of president and chief executive officer who will also serve as \nvice chairperson of the DBP board of directors, and (iii) exempting DBP from coverage by the \nSalary Standardization Law, 2008. \n \nB.   Corporate Powers of DBP \n \n4.  The DBP is subject to the regulations of the BSP. The bank\u2019s corporate powers include \nthe following:2 \n(i)  to grant loans to local governments and private sector entities for purposes of \nrehabilitation, establishment, or development of any agricultural and/or industrial \nenterprise,  including  public  utilities,  infrastructure  projects,  mining,  livestock \nindustry, and fishing, whether offshore or inland; \n(ii)  to grant loans to cooperative associations, individual employees of public and \nprivate  corporations  to  facilitate  agricultural  and  other  industrial  production,  \nmarketing,  and the acquisition of essential commodities; \n(iii)  to underwrite, purchase, own, sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of stocks, \nbonds, debentures, securities, and other evidences of indebtedness issued for or \nin connection with any project or enterprise for self-liquidating purposes and carry \non the business of a trust corporation; and \n(iv)  to organize, establish, and operate subsidiary corporations whenever necessary \nto better achieve DBP\u2019s objectives. \n \nC.  Organization Structure \n \n5.

DBP  account  officers  have \nattended  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank-sponsored  seminars  on \nprocurement, resettlement planning, gender and development planning, and loan disbursement \nprocedures. \n \nG.  Accounting Policies and Procedures, Audit, and Budgeting \n \n10.  Accounting is based on the accrual method. As mandated by the BSP, effective from \n2005, DBP adopted the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and the Philippine Accounting \nStandards, which correspond to International Financial Reporting Standards and International \nAccounting Standards. The Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and Philippine Accounting \nStandards were issued by the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards Council. DBP is audited ", "Appendix 11  55 \nannually  by  the  BSP  and  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  for  compliance  with \nregulatory requirements. The Commission on Audit is DBP\u2019s external independent auditor.  \n \nH.  Financial Performance3 \n \n11.  DBP\u2019s  selected  balance  sheet  accounts  are  shown  in  Table  A11.1.  DBP\u2019s  total \nresources grew at an average annual rate of 8.4% during 2004\u20132006. Its assets base reached \nP241.6 billion ($5.14 billion) in 2006, higher by 13.0% from the previous year\u2019s reported assets \nlevel of P213.8 billion ($4.55 billion). DBP\u2019s loans portfolio increased at an average annual \ngrowth rate of 29.9%, reflecting the bank\u2019s lending performance. The bank\u2019s loan portfolio of \nP137.83 billion in 2006 comprised 20.9% of loans extended by the wholesale banking sector \nand were made to 41 accredited financial institutions for their various developmental projects. A \nlarge portion of the increase in DBP\u2019s total assets can be traced to an unprecedented rise in its \nsecurities purchased under agreement to resell, which more than tripled from the level of \nP10.97 billion in 2005 to P42.68 billion in 2006. To increase its capital base, DBP issued tier 2 \ncapital securities in January 2006 and hybrid tier 1 capital securities in September 2006.  \n \n12.  The bank\u2019s total liabilities also exhibited an upward trend over the same period, growing \nat an annual average rate of 6.02%. The bank\u2019s deposit mobilization activities demonstrated \npositive results, as deposits reached P71.1 billion ($1.51 billion) in 2006 and the average growth \nrate for 2004\u20132006 was 39.68%. DBP\u2019s borrowing activities reflected a slight decrease over the \nperiod, growing at an annual average rate of 9%, as its efforts were focused on efficient lending \npractices and managing its asset-liability gap. DBP\u2019s equity position increased at an annual \naverage rate of 26.1%. The marked decrease in real and other properties owned or acquired by \nan average of 48% is evidence of the bank\u2019s improved credit supervision system.  \n \n \nTable A11.1: Selected Balance Sheet Accounts  \n (P billion) \n \n  Year  Growth Rate \nAccount  2004  2005  2006  2006/2005 (%) \nA.

An average 6.7% increase in total resources is assumed \ngenerated from average loan portfolio growth of 13.6% and 11.25% upward movement in \ninvestments. A 9% rise in borrowings is projected for 2007, followed by steady growth at an \naverage rate of 6% for the next 3 years. For deposits, an average cost of 11.8% was applied for \nthe same period while the cost of borrowings was assumed to average 3.85%. \n \n14.  Closer examination of the bank\u2019s nonperforming loans for 2004 and 2005 showed a \ndecreasing trend, which reflects improvement in the quality of loans extended by the bank and \nits enhanced management of credit risks. \n \n  2.  Income Statement Accounts \n \n15.  DBP\u2019s gross interest income grew steadily at an average annual rate of 13% from 2004 \nto 2006, while interest expenses increased at an average annual rate of 16% and there was \nadditional income from securities, investments, and placements. By implementing cost-cutting \nmeasures (such as an early retirement program), the bank kept administrative expenses within \nmanageable levels ranging from P4.38 billion in 2004 to P5.31 billion in 2006), yielding an \naverage annual growth rate of 10%. Projections assumed a modest 3% growth rate of interest \nincome  over  2007\u20132010.  This  was  accompanied  by  a  minimum  4%  rise  in  administrative \nexpenses and 2% climb in interest expense. \n \nTable A11.2: Actual and Projected Income Statements of DBP  \n(P billion) \n \nAccount  Actual    Projected \n2004  2005  2006  2007  2008      2009  2010 \nInterest Income  11.54  13.39  14.63 13.59 14.84  13.46 15.28\nInterest Expense  6.07  7.27  7.96 7.09 7.37  7.31 7.65\nNet Interest Income before Provision for  5.47  6.11 \nImpairment  6.68 6.51 7.46  6.15 7.63\nProvision for Impairment  1.20  0.91  2.18 1.32 0.31  0.30 0.50\nNet Interest Income after Provision for Impairment  4.27  5.20  4.50 5.19 7.15  5.85 7.13\nOther Income  2.44  3.69  3.35 3.04 1.17  1.78 1.65\nOther Expenses  4.38  4.98  5.35 5.65 5.01  5.26 5.52\nNet Income Before Provision for Income Tax  2.33  3.91  2.50 2.58 3.31  2.37 3.26\nProvision for Income Tax  (0.11)  0.11  -0.33 -0.13 0.05  0.10 0.10\nNet Income After Tax  2.44  3.80  2.83 2.71 3.26  2.27 3.16\nSource: Development Bank of the Philippines. \n \n  3.

Manila. \n ", "58  Appendix 12   \nSUMMARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nPUBLIC\u2013PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN HEALTH \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Sustainable Health Care Investment Program administered by the Development \nBank of the Philippines (DBP) is a credit facility established in 2007 to support the Department \nof Health's (DOH\u2019s) Health Sector Reform Agenda\u2014Fourmula One for Health (F1)\u2014and the \nGovernment\u2019s agenda to achieve the health-related millennium development goals (MDGs). The \nloan funds will be provided for public and private health subprojects and can be used for both \ncapital investments and working capital. The funds will be relent through (i) retail or direct \nrelending to larger subprojects in the public and private sectors, and (ii) wholesale or relending \nthrough financial intermediaries to private sector smaller-scale subprojects.  \n \n2.  DBP will relend to subprojects for (i) improving quality of health services to attain health \nfacility accreditation by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC); (ii) addressing the \ngaps in access to basic health services (for communicable disease control, woman and child \nhealth care, clinical care, ancillary services, and generic drugs); and (iii) improving efficiency in \nhealth service financing and delivery through outsourcing, improving management systems, and \nother innovative strategies. PHIC accreditation can provide an added stream of resources. \nPartnerships can provide an opportunity for the public sector to address shortages in financial \nand human resources.   \n \n3.  The attached technical assistance (TA) for Public\u2013Private Partnership in Health will \nprovide  support  to  the  subborrowers,  including  local  government  units  (LGUs)  and  private \nproviders, in enhancing modalities for public\u2013private partnership (PPP), including (i) innovative \nstrategies to improve efficiency, access, and quality of services; (ii) to assist small-scale health \ncare providers\u2019 obtain access to credit to support health-related MDGs; and (iii) to mobilize \nprivate resources for achieving MDGs.\n \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n4.  The TA\u2019s impact is to help improve the maternal and child health status by 2015 in the \nsubproject sites with PPP. The outcome of the TA will be tested PPP modalities that will have \ndemonstrated potential to increase the use of maternal and child health care and referral \nservices in the subproject sites with PPP.  \n   \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n5.  The TA will have three outputs: \n \n6.  Output 1. The TA will develop and promote PPP modalities in the health sector. For this, \nthe TA will (i) conduct an assessment (of policies, regulations, systems such as procurement \nand budgets, and readiness of civil society institutions), produce public service comparators on \nPPP, and prepare a report; (ii) assist in preparing documents (policy, regulations, guidelines \nincluding a handbook for PPP in the health sector) based on the recommendations of the report \nand the results of stakeholder consultations; and (iii) identify preliminary PPP health subprojects \nin parallel that could be supported under Credit for Better Health Care Project (the \u201cProject\u201d).    \n \n7.  Output 2. The TA will develop incentives and operational strategies to encourage the \nparticipation of private small-scale health providers in attaining PHIC accreditation for health \nservices (particularly in rural and underserved areas) in order to address health-related MDGs. \nThe TA will investigate and document case studies where providers are working in rural and \nunderserved areas in order to understand the incentives for them to locate to and remain in ", "Appendix 12  59 \nsuch areas (a report will be produced). The TA will work in close collaboration with private \nassociations, nongovernment organization microfinance institutions, and the LGUs to develop \nownership and commitment for, to operationalize, and to scale up these initiatives. LGUs under \nF1 are mapping health services and identifying gaps in services. Private small-scale health \nproviders will be provided access to credit under the Project, and the TA will work with the \npotential  subborrowers  to  create  demand  among  providers  to  locate  and  enhance  PHIC-\naccredited service provision in rural and underserved areas.  \n \n8.  Output 3. The TA will aim to initiate the contracting modality under PHIC. This initiative \nhas already started under TA supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB), whereby PHIC\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity is being built for contracting between PHIC and health services providers.1 \nThe contract would give PHIC better leverage with the providers, an opportunity to establish \nstandards  for  PHIC-provider  service  performance,  and  the  possibility  to  assess  PHIC \nbeneficiaries\u2019 satisfaction with the services. Contracting could aim to reduce balance billing and \ncontain health care cost inflation while improving financial protection for PHIC beneficiaries. The \nTA will continue to support this modality by helping progress this agenda under the Project, and \nthe TA will design mechanisms and tools\u2014then test them among project sites\u2014to test the \ncontracting modality, refine the contractual terms, monitor the contractual agreements, and \nassess the impact of the contracted services on the use and satisfaction of health services \nconsumers and providers. The tools will be used under the Project. Contracting should ensure \nimproved consumer satisfaction with the contracted health provider. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000. ADB will provide $1,000,000 on a grant basis. \nDBP will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent in kind, which will cover the costs of office \naccommodation; transport; utilities; seminar room space; remuneration of counterpart staff; and \nprovision of data, reports, and other relevant documents.    \n \nTable A12: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan ($) \nItem    Total Cost \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) poverty reduction strategy states \"Poverty is a deprivation of essential assets and \nopportunities to which every human is entitled. Everyone should have access to basic education and primary health services.\" \nThe Philippine country poverty assessment states \"Health status affects a person\u2019s ability to go to school, to obtain work and \ngenerate income, and to generally participate in society.\" The poverty assessment notes that access to quality health care is a \npressing poverty issue, particularly for maternal and child health care and treatment of communicable disease, although health \nspending is well below international standards and on a downward trend. The Philippines country strategy and program update \n2005\u20132007 calls for a refined focus to achieve more rapid poverty reduction and progress toward the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). While fiscal constraints persist, it adds direct support for the MDGs will be coursed through off-budget financing. \nThe Philippines\u2019 progress toward achieving the MDGs has been uneven. While the country appears to be on track for achieving \nmost MDG goals, the goals are not yet met. The most recent MDG progress reporta calls for accelerating implementation of \nbasic education and health care reforms, strengthening the capacity of local government units (LGUs) to provide basic services, \nand  generating and mobilizing resources for MDG-related programs. The proposed loan has been designed to support \nachievement of the health-related MDGs without burdening fiscal capacity and while mobilizing additional resources by \nleveraging private participation. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  TI-M  \n1. Key Issues  \nPhilippine progress in reducing poverty has been uneven, and the 2007 MDG report on the probability of achieving the \n47 indicators associated with the eight MDG goals cautions that a high probability is not a guarantee of achievement. The \nProject focuses on health MDGs: Goal 4 to reduce under-five and infant mortality; Goal 5 to improve maternal health; and Goal \n6 to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The Philippines\u2019 performance has been mixed. The probability is high for \nachieving indicators 4.1 on under-five mortality, 4.2 on infant mortality, and 6.6 on malaria. The probability is medium for \nachieving indicator 6.9 on the prevalence of tuberculosis. The probability is low for achieving indicator 4.3 on child immunization, \nindicator 5.1 on maternal mortality, indicator 5.2 on the proportion of births attended by a skilled birth attendant, indicator 5.3 on \nthe use of contraceptives, and indicator 6.9 on deaths from tuberculosis.b \n \nThe Project was designed to support implementation of the Government\u2019s agenda in health sector reform toward achieving the \nMDGs. The Department of Health (DOH) Fourmula One for Health (F1) reforms enhance access to primary medical care \nservices,  strengthen  effective  access  to  secondary  referral  care  services,  promote  partnership  between  the  public  and \nnongovernment sectors to address gaps in the public system, and promote innovative strategies for health system performance \nand efficiency gain. \n \nThe Kapit Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan (KALAHI), which means linking arms against poverty, was launched in 2001 as the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic framework for poverty reduction The framework has five components: (i) accelerated asset reform, (ii) \nimproved access to human development services, (iii) provision of employment and livelihood opportunities, (iv) security from \nviolence and social protection, and (v) institutionalized and strengthened participation. The KALAHI approach bringing together \nall levels of government, the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the target groups (farmers and landless \nrural workers, fisherfolk, informal sector workers, indigenous peoples, women, children, youth, the elderly, and victims of \ncalamities). KALAHI-CIDSS (Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services) is the Government\u2019s flagship program \nfor improving access to human development services using a community-driven development approach and providing funding \nfor microfinance for livelihood development and basic infrastructure investment, including in barangay health stations. \n \nThe Project links to the KALAHI strategy in several ways. The aim is to reduce poverty through achieving the health-related \nMDGs by improving access to basic health services (component i) while creating employment and livelihood opportunities \n(component iii) with the participation of government, the private sector, and NGOs. The Project provides an innovative package \nof health industry financial services enabling health service sector professionals to establish or expand their services. A \nsignificant portion of the investment will be for such micro-health enterprises as birthing homes and distributors and retailers of \ngeneric drugs, as well as for such small health enterprises as rural health units, primary care hospitals, or upgrading secondary \ncare hospitals. Local governments with limited fiscal capacity will gain access to off-budget means (through a development \nfinancial intermediary) to borrow for their health investment needs. The Project encourages public\u2013private partnerships by \nenabling the public sector to guarantee a minimum level of income to private investors, thus resulting in increased provision of \nhealth care services at a lower cost to the government. DOH and the Philippines Health Insurance Company (PHIC) are also \npartners in the Project by facilitating accreditation and expansion plus timely reimbursements of health care delivery costs. \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nAccreditation and PHIC reimbursements enable health care providers to deliver services at a lower cost, resulting in reduced \nout-of-pocket expenses for patients and enabling local governments to expand their indigent health care.  \n \nAchieving goals 4, 5, and 6 targets for reducing child and infant mortality, maternal mortality, and deaths from tuberculosis \nrequires improved access to front-line health personnel, to midwives and nurses, to basic drugs backed up by doctors for \ncomplications, and to a referral service for life-saving hospital care. The single best strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal \nmortality is for women to deliver in a medical facility with midwives and a medical team available. Death from tuberculosis \naccounts for 10% of all deaths in the Philippines and is preventable through public health care implemented at the primary \nhealth care (PHC) level. The leading causes of death for children under 5 years old are neonatal deaths followed by diarrhea \nand upper respiratory diseases. \n \nThe loan products will be marketed by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) through its regional centers. DBP\u2019s 17 \nregional centers are positioned to reach out to underserved areas. DBP has already initiated this outreach effort working with \nthe  League  of  Provinces  and  professional  health  service  provider  organizations.  The  impact  on  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds will be achieved through the choice of eligible investments. Expanding PHIC accreditation of public and private \nhealth service providers reduces health service costs. Expanding private birthing centers, small doctor practices, basic generic \ndrugs, and simple diagnostic facilities outside of a hospital setting brings basic health care to relatively underserved areas, \nthereby enabling timely access while reducing transportation costs. Subloans to provincial governments for rehabilitating rural \nhealth units, upgrading the capacity of hospitals, and improving referral networks enable delivery of public health programs and \ntimely access to basic lifesaving care.  \n \n2. Design Features. Special features of the Project enhance its MDG-targeting impact. The list of eligible and ineligible \ninvestments focuses on essential investments for achieving MDGs 4, 5, and 6. Allowable investments by type and level of health \nservices provider were screened to ensure the greatest gain in public health and focus on the key elements required for PHIC \naccreditation, thus enabling service delivery at lower cost. The social marketing components provide outreach to types of \ninvestors,  such  as  midwives,  who  are  generally  outside  the  scope  of  formal  financial  services  and  provide  access  to \nentrepreneurial training to support the business aspects of their investments. Local government is expected to take up the bulk \nof the investment in rural health units, either directly or through partnerships. Local government eligibility criteria include prior \npreparation of a health investment plan and a commitment to increase support for indigent health care.  \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nThe Project\u2019s ultimate beneficiaries are women, children, indigents and the ill, and families.  \n \nWomen bear multiple costs of inadequate access to health care in their reproductive and child-rearing roles. Maternal mortality \nis intractably high. Fifty-five percent of all Filipino women deliver at home. Yet one of the major interventions to reduce maternal \nmortality and improve neonatal survival is for a woman to deliver at a properly equipped health facility attended by a \nprofessional. Location plays a large role in determining place of delivery. In rural areas, 43% of women in the highest income \nquintile deliver at home, while among their better-served urban counterparts only 17% of women in the highest income quintile \ndeliver at home.c The most frequently cited reason for women delivering at home is cost. Hospital delivery is expensive. Public \nprograms provide free antenatal care for poor women but not the cost of delivery. Facilitating PHIC accreditation of service \nproviders, including midwives, reduces patient out-of-pocket costs and brings quality obstetric care closer to home at a \nsignificantly lower cost. \n \nThe leading causes of death among children under 5 years old are largely preventable: pneumonia, diarrhea, and measles. \nPoor access to PHC results in underutilization, thus transforming manageable illnesses into catastrophic events. The rural \nhealth units (RHUs) are often understaffed and essential drugs stocked-out, thus constraining their support to the barangay \nhealth station (BHS) front-line care and public outreach programs. RHUs and BHSs jointly provide 50% of all outpatient care. \nUpgrading rural health units performance is key to effectively delivering PHC and reducing the leading causes of under-5 \nmortality. \n \nThe same proportion of poor and nonpoor\u2014many of whom are near-poor\u2014self-medicate when ill. The most significant \ndifference between poor and nonpoor is in the choice of service provider; the public sector provides more than half of all care for \nthe poor and nonpoor.d The private sector also serves a surprisingly large proportion of the poor. In Metro Manila, the poor \nalmost exclusively use the public health system for outpatient care, and 60% make use of city and barangay health services. \nThe public sector serves about 60% of the nonpoor. Outside of Metro Manila, 75% of the poor utilize the public health system for \noutpatient services compared to about 60% of the non-poor. The private sector provides the balance. While private sector \nmedical care is sometimes viewed as beyond the reach of the poor, it is in fact an important partner to government in providing \nhealth care services to the poor.  \n \n ", "Appendix 13  63 \nDrug costs are high, and outside the major cities distribution is uneven and unreliable. The Government has initiated a program \nto ensure the availability of essential generic medicines at the municipal level by promoting private sector investment in generic \ndrug distribution and stocking. The Project targets expansion of provincial or regionally based distribution networks and \nupgrading of small retail or cooperative pharmacies as generic drug outlets.  \n \nFamilies are aware of local health care conditions, including staffing, quality of services, and availability of medication. As a \nresult, even the poor will go into debt and leapfrog PHC facilities to reach higher quality health care at a public or private hospital \nwith a good reputation. As a result, hospitals are overburdened by the demand for outpatient PHC services that should have \nbeen provided at lower-level facilities and their capacity to deliver appropriate hospital services is diminished. In addition, when \nPHC services are provided in a hospital setting, they are delivered at high cost that unnecessarily burdens either local \ngovernment coffers or private patients\u2019 pocketbooks. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were carried out during the design phase of the Project to determine (i) health investments that will help \nin achieving MDGs, (ii) potential health care services investors and the loan conditions they prefer, and (iii) the factors that \nwould facilitate these investments. Consultative methods included presentations to associations, key person interviews, plus \nfocus group discussions and small group workshops for consensus development. Consultations covered national government \nagencies, such as the DOH, Philippine Council for Accreditation of Health Organizations, PHIC, and Philippine International \nTrading Corporation. International organizations active in the health sector were included, such as World Health Organization, \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation, United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. The  \nmain focus was on representatives of targeted subloan investors: provincial government health officials, the University of the \nPhilippines, Doctors to the Barrio program managers, Philippines Doctors Association, Private Hospitals Association, Drug \nAssociation, Midwives Association, owners of primary and secondary hospitals, and owners of tertiary hospitals regarding \nconstruction of outpatient satellite clinics, cooperatives, not-for-profit franchises providing maternal and child health services, \nfamily doctors, midwives, and providers of support services such as for physical rehabilitation providers, clinical laboratories, \nand pharmacists. Although the Project is national in scope, the consultations focused on Davao City in region XI; Sta. Maria and \nSan Miguel municipalities in Bulacan, region III; Iloilo City in region VI; Cebu City in region VII; and Cagayan de Oro City and \nMisamis Oriental in region X in Mindanao. These areas were selected because of their limited health services and low-income \nrural areas. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No   \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues: Low access to affordable quality basic care is reflected in the health status of the family, increases the burden \non women as caretakers, and raises the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery. The Project encourages investments \naddressing women\u2019s reproductive health needs, including for safe maternal and neonatal care through the development of \nmidwives- and obstetrician-owned birthing facilities. Professional midwives are female micro-entrepreneurs outside the scope of \ntraditional microfinance development schemes that face difficulties upgrading and expanding their businesses because of \ninexperience with banking and with health facility financial management. They have difficulty in achieving PHIC accreditation, \nalthough that would help offset their clients\u2019 low ability to pay. Obstetricians seeking to open facilities in rural areas are generally \nexperienced with banks and banking but are otherwise subject to the same constraints as midwives. \n2.  Key Actions.

DBP will carry out due diligence on all investments   \nand only finance those that are wholly owned with clear title and free of any \ninformal settler issues. DBP has sufficient experienced property appraisers \nto execute the due diligence required. DBP\u2019s operating guidelines on the \nuse of the project funds will include involuntary resettlement safeguard \nprocedures  to  flag  all  subloan  proposals  with  potential  involuntary \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nresettlement impacts. In their due diligence report, account officers and the \nproperty appraiser will indicate whether a proposed subproject would cause \nany involuntary resettlement impacts, and, if not, whether there had been \nany  eviction  of  informal  dwellers,  as  well  as  whether  involuntary \nresettlement guidelines had been followed and all requirements had been \nmet.  DBP\u2019s  programs  unit  will  ensure  and  certify  compliance,  that  no \nsubloan credit application was approved that would cause any involuntary \nresettlement impacts, and that no eviction of informal dwellers had been \nundertaken. A resettlement framework has been prepared detailing the \nprocedures to be followed by DBP to ensure there are no involuntary \nresettlement impacts associated with the Project. \nIndigenous  Limited  As the proposed Project is a financial intermediary loan, the subloan site    \nPeoples   locations are not known. While the Project is national in scope, the activities  Indigenous \n  will be location-specific. The impact of the proposed loan on indigenous   Peoples \npeoples will depend on the nature and location of eligible investments   Framework \nproposed by subloan borrowers interested in accessing the credit facility.   \nThe  location  may  include  indigenous  people  locations,  such  as  tribal \nbarangays, indigenous people ancestral domains, or proposed ancestral \ndomains. Subloan proponents may be indigenous peoples, non-indigenous \npeoples, or other organizations. Eligible public sector subloans will not have \nan indigenous people impact, as they are required to maintain or restore a \nlevel  and  type  of  service  already  provided.  Private  commercial  sector \nsubloans  are  not  expected  in  most  indigenous  people  areas,  because \nremote and low population density areas generate little demand. Private \ncharitable organizations with outreach to indigenous people areas generally \nmeet their capital requirements from their memberships. Credit demand \nmay exist in the population centers of special areas where large parts or an \nentire province has been designated as an indigenous people\u2019s area. Free \nand prior informed consent is only required, however, if the proponent is a \nmigrant. As loan operational guidelines require the proponents to hold title \nto their proposed project sites, subloan proposals from migrants are unlikely \nto qualify. Few and possibly no subloans with indigenous people impacts \nare expected. An indigenous people framework has been prepared that \ndetails  the  procedures  to  be  followed  to  screen  and  identify  subloan \nproposals for potential indigenous people impacts as part of the initial credit \nassessment, specifies the actions required, and monitors compliance.  \nLabor  Limited  The Project\u2019s subloans create employment in the health care sector through     No Action \n Employment  Impact  investments in such health care microenterprises as birthing clinics and \nopportunities  pharmacies. \nAffordability  Significant  The Project increases heath care affordability by improving access to PHC at     No Action \nthe local level, where it can be delivered at lower cost and closer to home. \nThe  Project  facilitates  enrollment  in  the  PHIC  outpatient  care  benefit \npackage that reduces out-of-pocket costs for private patients and enables \nlocal governments to cover more indigents from the same budget. \nOther  Risks  /  No impact     \nVulnerabilities  \nIV.
