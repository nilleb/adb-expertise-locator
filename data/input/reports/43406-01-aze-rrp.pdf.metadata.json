It  will  replace  the  Shirvan  Thermal  Power  Plant  (TPP),  Azerbaijan's  second  largest \npower plant, which is more than 40 years old and now inefficient. The project will increase the \nstability  of  the  power  generation  system  in  Azerbaijan  and  improve  the  reliability  of  the  power \nsupply  in  the  country's  industrial  and  economic  hub  in  the  Absheron  Peninsula.  By \ndecommissioning the Shirvan TTP and replacing it with a plant with state-of-the-art technology, \nthe  project  will  significantly  increase  power-generating  efficiency,  while  decreasing  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  power  generation  in  the  project  area.  The  PCG  will  support  a \ncommercial  bank  loan  that  will  finance  maintenance  workshops,  heavy  fuel  tanks, a  treatment \nsystem, and laboratory equipment needed to complete the new plant and the decommissioning \nof the Shirvan TPP. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDespite  the  global  economic  downturn,  Azerbaijan's  gross  domestic  product  increased \nby 10.8% in 2008, fueled by the export of new oil and gas production. Azerbaijan has abundant \nenergy resources, with hydrocarbon reserves estimated at 7,000 billion barrels of oil equivalent.1 \nHowever, efficiency and security in the power sector is a government priority, since excess fuel \ncan  be  exported.2 Further,  the  poor  quality  and  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply  inhibits  the \nexpansion of industrial, agriculture, and commercial activities, which are needed for Azerbaijan \nto  diversify  its  economy  away  from  hydrocarbon-related  sectors.  Low  power  plant  efficiency \ncombined with transmission and distribution losses have wasted fossil fuels and nearly doubled \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  pollutants  that  damage  the  regional  and  global \nenvironment.  \n \nThe power sector has gone through a series of reforms. Sector restructuring has been \n4. \nachieved,  in  part  because  of  (i)  the  establishment  of  four  regional  distribution  companies;  (ii) \nprivate  sector  participation  in  generation;  and  (iii)  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, which is responsible for energy sector policy making, pricing and tariffs, licensing, \nand  management  of  fixed  assets.  The  Tariff  Council,  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, has the authority to propose tariff adjustments, define customer categories, and \nadopt cost-reflective tariff design. All large companies had to change to International Financial \nReporting  Standards  by  January  2008,  and  all  government  ministries  had  to  adopt  the \nInternational Public Reporting Standards by January 2009. The commercialization of Azerenerji \nJoint Stock Company (AzerEnergy), the state-owned enterprise responsible for management of \nmajor  thermal  and  hydropower  generation  plants,  transmission,  and  part  of  the  distribution \nnetwork, has been accelerated. The aim is to turn AzerEnergy into a leading international power \ninternational  safeguard  standards. \ntechnology  and \ncompany  applying  state-of-the-art \nAzerbaijan's  development  partners  have  supported  the  creation  of  the  Investment  Department \nto tighten financial controls and the Ecology Unit to oversee safeguards. Both are progressing \nwell. \n\n                                                 \n1 Beyond Petroleum. 2009. BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2009. http://www.bp.com/productlanding.do?categ \n  oryId=6929&contented=7044622 \n2 Azerbaijan Economy and Power Sector: Challenges and Opportunities (Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nMore than 20% of all energy equipment and more than half of the network facilities have \n5. \nexceeded their useful life. Azerbaijan has been refurbishing and replacing old generation plants \nand  improving  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  to  increase  efficiency.  Although \ndemand decreased in 2007 because of conservation measures that followed a rise in customer \nprices  to  a  cost  recovery  level,  a  4.0%  annual  increase  in  demand  is  forecast  to  2030.3 The \ncurrent  shortfall  in  peak  load  is  about  300  MW.  However,  the  available  generation  capacity  is \n5,070  MW.  TPPs  generated  85%  of  the  power,  while  hydropower  plants  produce  15%.  Only \n32%  of  the  plants  are  running  at  optimal  capacity.  The  refurbishment  of  the  biggest  plants\u2014\nAzerbaijanskaya  and  Shirvan,  which  produce  57%  of  available  capacity\u2014will  complete  the \nrefurbishment plan.  \n \n6. \nStarting  commercial  operations  in  1962,  the  Shirvan  TPP  is  the  second  biggest  power \nplant  in  Azerbaijan,  accounting  for  22%  of  electricity  production  in  2006\u20132007.  The  plant  has \noutlived  its  useful  life  as  demonstrated  by  a  thermal  efficiency  of  only  27%  and  available \ngeneration capacity of 600 MW (57% of its installed capacity). The plant has become unreliable \nand poses a threat to the power security of Azerbaijan.  \n \n7. \nThe project will be located within the same site as the Shirvan TPP to take advantage of \nthe  existing  infrastructure,  such  as  overhead  lines,  gas  pipeline,  access  roads,  railways,  and \nstand-by fuel storage and handling facilities. In addition to ensuring energy security, the project \nwill  (i)  have  an  average  efficiency  of  52%,4 (ii)  generate  efficiency  savings  by  reducing  costs \nfrom  \u20ac0.017  per  kilowatt  hour  (kWh)  to  \u20ac0.012 per  kWh,  (iii)  increase  exports  if  excess  gas  is \nexported  ($54.4  million  per  year),  and  (iv)  reduce  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gas  and  other \npollutants.  Given  the  considerable  benefits,  the  government  is  committed  to  fast-tracking  the \nproject. \n \n8. \nThe  original  financing  plan  called  for  government  funds  and  sovereign-guaranteed \ncommercial bank loans to finance the entire cost of the project. In 2008, the first financing phase \nwas successfully completed through a \u20ac284 million syndicated long-term commercial bank loan. \nHowever,  because  of  the  global  financial  crisis,  commercial  loans  became  scarce  and \nexpensive in late 2008 when financing was sought for the second financing phase. The second \nround  of  financing  was  to  fund,  among  other  things,  the  maintenance  workshops,  heavy  fuel \ntanks, a treatment system, and the laboratory equipment needed to complete the new plant and \nthe decommissioning of the Shirvan TPP.  \n \n9. \nThe PCG from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support a commercial bank loan \nof up to \u20ac220 million to AzerEnergy. The PCG will double the maturity available and more than \nhalve  the  interest  margin  that  would  be  charged  by  commercial  banks,  thereby  increasing  the \nfinancial and economic viability of the project. It will also mark the return of AzerEnergy to the \ninternational commercial bank debt market. \n \nIn  the  latest  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006),5 the  government  requested \n10. \nADB  support  for  energy  within  an  expanded  lending  program,  particularly  for  power \ntransmission and distribution, climate change mitigation, and improving AzerEnergy's access to \ncapital markets. The Power Transmission Enhancement Project,6 approved in August 2008, is in \nline with this strategy. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2009.

This  project  also  has \nAzerEnergy as the borrower and executing agency, and will act as the anchor participation for the PCG. \n\n\fB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  an  improved  power  system  that  provides  electricity  needed  for \nsustained  economic  growth.  The  project  is  an  integral  part  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  power  sector \ndevelopment strategy. The outcome will be Azerenergy's increased capacity to provide efficient \nand reliable power to customers. ADB's assistance through the PCG will also (i) support reforms \nunderway  to  strengthen  the  financial  position  and  transparency  of  AzerEnergy,  enabling  it  to \noperate  sustainably  and  independently;  (ii)  help  AzerEnergy  successfully  return  to  the \ninternational  commercial  bank  debt  market,7 and  diversify  and  deepen  Azerenergy's  funding \nsources; and (iii) set the stage for AzerEnergy's access to the international capital market in the \nmedium term. \n \nThe project will meet European emission standards. After the commissioning of the new \n12. \nplant,  the  Shirvan  TPP  will  be  decommissioned.  By  also  financing  the  Shirvan  TPP \ndecommissioning from proceeds of the commercial loan, ADB will ensure that it is carried out in \na  timely  manner  and  complies  with  ADB's  safeguard  policies  with  regard  to  precautionary \nmeasures. \n \nC. \n\nOutput \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe  project  will  construct  780  MW  combined-cycle  power  plant  and  auxiliary  services \n\n13. \nwith an average efficiency of 52%.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe project is estimated to cost \u20ac691 million including taxes, duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  capitalized  interest,  and  other  charges.

The Abu Dhabi Fund for \nDevelopment and other cofinanciers have indicated an interest in providing cofinancing suitable for the project of \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncommercial loan will have a 13-year tenor (3-year grace period and 10-year repayment period) \nand  a  market-based  interest  rate.  The  PCG  will  provide  comprehensive  cover 9 for  80%  of \nprincipal (up to \u20ac176 million) plus accrued regular interest, as well as 80% of break costs (if any) \nrelated  to  interest  rate  and/or  foreign  currency  hedging  arrangements 10 associated  with  the \ncommercial  loan.  ADB  will  charge  guarantee  and  commitment  fees  based  on  ADB's  loan \nequivalency pricing for sovereign lending.11 The PCG will be backed by ADB's ordinary capital \nresources.  Under  the  sovereign  counter-guarantee  provided  to  ADB,  the  Government  will \nindemnify and reimburse ADB for any amounts paid under the PCG.    \n \n16 \nFollowing  a  two-step  competitive  bidding  process,  which  required  the  bidders  to \ndemonstrate that ADB's PCG was needed to significantly improve the tenor, pricing, and other \nrelevant terms of the commercial loan, two mandated lead arrangers were selected in January \n2010 to arrange and provide the commercial loan on a best effort basis. Disbursements under \nthe commercial loan will be allowed after conditions precedents are satisfied, including the ADB \nPCG  having  become  effective.  This  will  require,  among  other  things,  the  issuance  of  the \nsovereign counter-guarantee by the government. The proposed financing plan for the project is \nsummarized in Table 2 and detailed in the cost estimates and financing plan.12 \n \n\nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n(\u20ac million) \n\nSource \nCommercial loan (second financing phase) a \nIslamic Development Bank  \n\nOPEC Fund for International Development \nCommercial bank loanb (first financing phase) \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n220  \n134  \n\n20  \n\n284  \n\n33  \n          691   \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPercent \n32.0 \n19.0 \n\n3.0 \n\n41.0 \n\n5.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n  \na Of this amount, 80% is to be guaranteed under the ADB's PCG.

If that cofinancing firms up, the size of the commercial loan and ADB's exposure under the PCG \nwould be reduced accordingly.  \n\n9  This will cover the risk of AzerEnergy's inability or unwillingness to fulfill its debt service and repayment obligations \n\non time because of commercial and/or political events. \n\n10 Hedging  arrangements  between  AzerEnergy  and  the  banks,  if  used,  will  be  embedded  in  the  commercial  loan \nagreement, and must be approved by ADB and the government, and have pricing and other terms that fairly reflect \nthe benefit of the ADB PCG. \n\n11 Currently,  the  guarantee  fee  is  0.20%  per  year  on  the  utilized  and  outstanding  amount  of  the  PCG,  and  the \ncommitment fee is 0.05% per year on the unutilized amount of the PCG during the availability period. These fees \nwill apply  if the PCG is negotiated by 30 June 2010. If the PCG is negotiated between 1 July 2010 and 30 June \n2011, the guarantee fee will increase to 0.30% per year and the commitment fee will increase to at least 0.075% \nper year.   \n\n12 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n\fits  staff  to  undertake  project  implementation  responsibilities  is  considered  satisfactory. 13  A \nproject management unit has been established for the project.  \n \n18. \nCommercial  banks  will  (i)  provide  the  commercial  loan  (and  hedging  arrangements,  if \nneeded)  directly  to  AzerEnergy;  (ii)  be  responsible  for  monitoring  conditions  precedents  and \nloan  covenants;  and  (iii)  have  various  obligations  to  ADB  as  guarantor,  which  will  include  the \nsharing of information and the enforcement of rights and obligations under the guaranteed loan. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 (footnote 12).  \n \n\n1. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement  conducted  by  AzerEnergy  and \n\n \n19. \nThe  implementation  of  the  project  is  at  an  advanced  stage.

The  project  will  (i)  increase  the  capacity  of  the  network  and  provide  enhanced \nelectricity export opportunities to neighboring countries; (ii) reduce power generation from older \nand less-efficient facilities, and/or delay the construction of other new power generation plants; \n(iii)  improve  energy  efficiency,  which  will  result  in  projected  gas  savings  of  324  million  cubic \nmeters  of  gas  per  year,  realizing  additional  export  revenues  of  \u20ac54.4  million  per  year;  (iv) \nproduce  net  savings  in  non-gas  annual  operating  costs;  and  (v)  improve  power  generation \nreliability for consumers. \n \nA financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines.15 \n24. \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  at  2009  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to \ndetermine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (i.e.,  capital  investment,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance) reflect the cost of delivering the estimated benefits. The tariff for electricity\u2014the \nwholesale  rate  at  which  AzerEnergy  sells  electricity  to  the  distribution  companies\u2014is  set  at \n\u20ac0.035 per 1 kWh, including the value-added tax. It is assumed that sufficient demand exists to \nallow the power station to operate at full capacity. The pricing of gas as the main energy source \nis  \u20ac0.04017  per  1,000  cubic  meters,  including  the  value-added  tax.  This  price  is  based  on  an \nannual  contract  at  the  state  determined  price.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.0% \ncompares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.4%,  indicating \nfinancial  viability  for  the  project.  Nonquantifiable  financial  benefits,  such  as  reliability  of  power \nsupply, were not included in the financial analysis. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith AzerEnergy and the government. This will also be done with the commercial banks when \nthe PCG is negotiated. ADB will reserve the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, \nany alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. Relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy as well as its Policy on Combating Money Laundering \nand Financing of Terrorism (2003) will be included in the PCG and the commercial loan facility \nagreement. In particular, all contracts financed by the commercial loan shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, agents, and others as they relate to the project.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nBy increasing the supply of efficient and reliable electricity to the system, the project will \nensure the stable supply of power to people in the rural and urban areas for their commercial \nand social activities. The lack of sufficient electricity, along with gas and heat, has aggravated \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n15  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\fthe  regional  imbalances  in  the  country.  Poor-quality  and  unreliable  electricity  supply  inhibits \nindustrial,  agricultural,  and  commercial  activities,  constraining  economic  growth  and \nemployment opportunities in regional areas. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nOperation.  Monitoring  and  reporting  during  operation  will  follow  the  provisions  in  the \n\n27. \nConstruction.  During  construction,  the  project  will  not  have  any  major  environmental \nimpacts.  Project  implementation  will  require  environmental  monitoring  and  reporting  during \nconstruction,  as  detailed  in  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP),  to \navoid  standard  construction  impacts.  This  will  also  ensure  that  mitigating  procedures  are \nimplemented.  These  measures  include  controlling  runoff  via  sedimentation  ponds,  building \nbunds  around  fuel  and  oil  storage  areas,  cleaning  up  construction  sites,  properly  disposing  of \nspoils,  grading  damaged  land  and  replanting  vegetation,  and  protecting  the  public  from \nexcessive noise and dust during construction. Special handling will be required with respect to \ntoxic  polychlorinated  biphenyls  in  transformer  cooling  oil,  if  any.  AzerEnergy  has  assured  that \nthe new transformers will be filled with a nontoxic substitute for polychlorinated biphenyls. Since \nthe  Ecology  Unit  of  AzerEnergy  does  not  have  sufficient  skills  to  implement  an  EMMP \neffectively,  ADB  is  funding  an  international  specialist  to  provide  training  in  environmental \nmanagement. \n \nDecommissioning  and  demolition.  Environmental  safeguards  dealing  with  the \n28. \ndecommissioning  and  demolition  of  the  old  Shirvan  TPP  will  need  to  be  clearly  defined  in  the \ndecommissioning and demolition contract. These safeguards will apply to the 12 old 5,000 cubic \nmeter  oil  tanks  and  possibly  also  to  the  6  newer  20,000  cubic  meter  oil  tanks  along  with  the \nloading  and  handling  facilities.  They  will  need  to  take  into  consideration  relevant  Azeri \nenvironmental laws and regulations, as well as international standards. \n \n29. \nEMMP added to the current contract for the project. \n \n30. \nResettlement  and  employment.  A  total  of  60  families  (pensioners  and  current  TPP \nemployees),  including  three  refugee  families  were  living  in  the  employee  apartments  in  the \nlocation  where  the  project  is  being  built.  A  new  five-story  apartment  block  was  built  in  the \nnearest  town  of  Shirvan  and  the  families  have  been  resettled  there  with  AzerEnergy's \nassistance.  A  due  diligence  activity  of  the  relocation  process  of  Janub  TPP  employees  was \nconducted  and  concluded  that  the  relocation  activities  carried  out  are  consistent  with  the \nrequirements of the ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The main results of the due \ndiligence  are:  (i)  there  is  no  loss  of  income  experienced  by  the  affected  families  due  to  the \nrelocation  activity;  (ii)  the  project  had  provided  the  affected  families  with  new  apartments  in  a \nbetter  condition  with  the  required  facilities  and  infrastructure;  (iii)  the  affected  gardens  in  the \nprevious location cannot be replaced in the new location, but there was no complaint from the \naffected  families  and  the  activity  was  no  longer  essential  since  produce  and  other  vegetables \ncan  now  be  acquired  from  the  nearby  market;  (iv)  all  the  associated  costs  related  to  the \nrelocation/resettlement activities were fully covered by the project; and (v) the affected families \nwere fully informed on the project activities through a series of consultation meetings and gave \ntheir  full  agreement  to  the  project.  Based  on  the  above,  the  project  is  classified  as  \u201cC\u201d  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  However,  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard \nRequirements 2 of the Safeguard Policy Statement will be prepared if unanticipated involuntary \nresettlement impacts should occur.16  \n \n                                                 \n16 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Due Diligence Report (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nIndigenous peoples. No indigenous people live in the area of the old or new plant. The \n31. \nproject will not trigger ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and will be classified as \u201cC.\u201d \nThe preparation of an indigenous peoples development plan is not required.17  \n \nEmployment. In 2007, when the Shirvan TPP was in full operation with six of the seven \n32. \nturbines running, it employed 1,012 people. The number of employees needed to run the plant \ndecreased, as new and more efficient plants have come on line. The Shirvan TPP staff dropped \nfrom  964  in  2008  to  381  in  late  2009.  Since  2007,  more  than  170  have  retired  and  460  were \nreemployed with the assistance of AzerEnergy at various industrial and construction companies. \nIn addition to receiving a pension or severance payment, many of the former employees have \nsmall  businesses  and  small  plots  of  land  for  farming  in  Shirvan  district.  About  100  employees \nwill  be  needed  to  operate  the  project  plant.  Of  these,  40  will  come  from  the  old  Shirvan  TPP. \nThis  will  result  in  341  additional  redundancies,  and  they  will  be  assisted  in  reemployment, \noffered  retirement,  retrained  for  work  inside  AzerEnergy,  or  given  severance  payment  in \naccordance with national laws. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nRisks  have  been  analyzed  and  deemed  acceptable  and/or  mitigated.  The  Project  is  a \npriority  of  the  Government  and  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  will  coordinate  the  work  of  the \ngovernment  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues,  if  any,  are  resolved  promptly.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.18 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMajor Risks \nUnexpected increase in prices of \ncommodities and raw materials \nDelay on procurement due to \ngovernmental approvals \nDelays in implementation of social \nand environmental mitigation \nmeasures \nDelays in construction due to \ninexperience of the EPC contractor \nSudden deterioration of international \ncredit markets prevent the ADB \nPCG from overcoming international \nloan market access barrier \n\nMitigating Measures \nProcurement  is  at  an  advanced  stage  so  price  increase  risk \nand delay risks are minimized \n\nEcology  Unit  has  been  established  and  ADB  is  providing \ncapacity  development  assistancea  and  AzerEnergy \nis \ncommitted to achieving international standards \nExperienced  supervision  consultants  are  on-site  to  assist  and \nmonitor the EPC contractor \nIn  January  2010,  AzerEnergy  successfully  appointed  two \nmandated lead arrangers to arrange the commercial loan on a \nbest  effort  basis,  each  agreeing  to  take  a  35%  participation. \nSince then ADB has held frequent consultations with these and \nother  international  commercial  banks  who  continue  to  believe \nthat the proposed PCG will achieve its objective \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; AzerEnergy = Azerenerji Joint Stock Company; EPC = engineering, procurement, \nand construction; PCG = partial credit guarantee. \na  Footnote 12. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nThe government and AzerEnergy have assured ADB that implementation of the project \n34. \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \n                                                 \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n\fmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed  in  the  legal  documents.
