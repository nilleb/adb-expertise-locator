THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Assam Power Sector Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will finance a portion of the power sector investment \nplan for generation  and  distribution  of  the  Government  of  Assam (GOA).2 The  investment \nprogram objectives are to increase capacity and efficiency of power generation and distribution \nsystems  in the  State  of  Assam  to  reduce  load  shedding  and meet growing  demand. The \ninvestment components include the construction of two power generation projects with total new \ncapacity of 190 megawatts (MW), and installation of critical distribution assets in selected urban \nareas of Assam. The physical infrastructure development will be complemented with a capacity \ndevelopment component. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector  overview.  Assam\u2019s  power  sector  faces  serious  challenges:  about  37%  of \nhouseholds have access to electricity with about 5\u20136 hours of power cuts per day. In fiscal year \n(FY)  2012,  peak  demand for  power  was  1,250  MW against  available  supply  of  960 MW, \nindicating a shortfall of 23%. Only about 30% of the state\u2019s 700 tea gardens\u2014one of the \nmainstays of the Assam economy\u2014are supplied with grid electricity. The remainder use natural \ngas for tea manufacturing; the gas supply is erratic. On the supply side, Assam is heavily \ndependent on power imports from other states, with only about 25% of demand currently met by \nin-state generation. During peak periods, Assam is forced to purchase as much as 15% of its \npower requirement from independent power producers at very high cost. The poor financial \nperformance of the state\u2019s power companies imposes a burden on the economy. Demand for \npower is projected to increase to 2,200 MW by FY2020. Major investments in power generation \nare required to increase capacity and meet the growing demand.  \n \n4.  The state\u2019s power distribution company, Assam Power Distribution Company (APDC), \nhas had some success in reducing losses: distribution losses decreased from 40% in FY2001 to \n24% in FY2012. However, loss reduction has stagnated due to the provision of new power \nconnections without system upgrades, inadequate investment, and poor management practices. \nAPDC\u2019s  inability  to  meet  the  loss  reduction  targets  approved  by  the  Assam  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (AERC) has resulted in revenue shortfalls. APDC has petitioned for a \ndistribution loss allowance of 23% for FY2014 and 22% for FY2016. Achieving these targets \nrequires capital investment and improvements in distribution system management. \n  \n5.  The state\u2019s power companies, Assam Power Generation Corporation (APGC) and APDC, \ndo not have sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations, invest in their capital assets, \nand build staff capacity. The broader economic implications of the poorly performing power \nsector  include  curtailed  competitiveness  and  productivity,  fewer  job  opportunities,  reduced \nprivate sector investment, and inefficient use of resources. Supply deficits force consumers to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The investment program was prepared under Asian Development Bank. 2009.

The Electricity Act of India (2003) enabled unbundling of the state \npower utilities, separating generation, transmission, and distribution functions. The act enabled \nthe establishment of state and national regulatory agencies, opened access to transmission \nnetworks, and promoted competition in the electricity industry. The National Electricity Policy \n(2005) enabled setting targets to increase availability, eliminate power shortages, and define \nlifeline consumption to ensure profitability of power entities. The Rural Electrification Policy \n(2006) includes provisions for accelerated rural electrification in India through grid and off-grid \nelectrification and innovative financing and operating mechanisms. The 12th Five Year Plan, \n(FY2012\u2013FY2017)  stresses the need to invest in renewable energy and frontier technologies.3 \n \n7.  In 2003, GOA introduced a power policy statement, highlighting the need to (i) ensure \ncommercial  orientation,  efficiency,  and  financial  viability  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  carry  out \ntechnical,  managerial,  and  administrative  restructuring  of  power  utilities;  (iii)  increase  the \nnumber of power utilities in the state; and (iv) promote private sector participation in the power \nsector. In implementing this policy framework, GOA unbundled the Assam State Electricity \nBoard (ASEB) into three companies: APGC, Assam Electricity Grid Corporation (AEGC), and \nAPDC. 4 AERC oversees the regulatory aspects of the sector.  \n \n8.  Sector road map. GOA prepared a power sector master plan with Asian Development \nBank (ADB) assistance5 for the 12th (FY2012\u2013FY2017) and 13th (FY2017\u2013FY2022) planning \nperiods. Objectives are to (i) achieve universal access to electricity by 2022, (ii) improve quality \nand reliability of power supply, and (iii) remove power sector constraints to improve the state\u2019s \neconomy.  The  master  plan  includes  a  sector  road  map,  including  a  generation  plan,  a \ntransmission plan, and a distribution plan, with a total cost of about $3.5 billion. According to the \nplan, the state\u2019s generation capacity will be increased from 365 MW (as of May 2013) to  \n1,410 MW by March 2022. The total cost of this capacity addition is estimated to be $1.2 billion. \nIn addition, the northeast region of India is to increase generation capacity by 3,636 MW during \nthe 12th Five Year Plan period. Assam expects to access its share of about 990 MW from the \ncentral generating stations to help meet the state\u2019s growing demand. \n \n9.  The  transmission  plan  of  the  road  map  envisages  constructing  88  transmission \nsubstations, and about 4,800 circuit-kilometers (km) of transmission lines. The estimated cost of \nthe  transmission  plan  is  about  $1.1  billion.  The  distribution  plan  envisages  building  \n265  distribution  substations  and  63,500  circuit-km  of  distribution  lines  to  provide  about  \n7.1 million new power connections at a cost of about $1.1 billion. Loss reduction remains a key \nfocus  of GOA\u2019s  sector road map:  it  aims  to reduce total  losses  to  19% (comprising  15% \ndistribution loss and 4% transmission loss)6 by FY2017. The road map includes institutional \nstrengthening initiatives for improved construction supervision capacity, enhanced management \nof  ongoing  projects,  improved  financial  management  systems,  and  a  fully  computerized \nmanagement system.  \n \n \n                                                \n3  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

Since 2003, ADB has supported the Assam power sector with five \nloans totaling $450 million for sector reforms, and transmission and distribution improvements.7 \nThe  power  sector  master  plan  and  associated  sector  road  map  are  consistent  with  the \ndevelopment goals and strategies of the central government and ADB. The government\u2019s 12th \nFive Year Plan continues its 11th Five Year Plan\u2019s infrastructure investment imperative, and \nincludes expanded use of renewable energy resources to increase energy availability in the \ncountry. The investment program is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017 for India, which envisages expansion, improvement, and better management of energy \nsystems  through  renewable  energy  development,  transmission  and  distribution  system \nimprovement, and institutional strengthening.8 The investment program contributes to achieving \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy objectives of promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, access to \nenergy for all, and capacity building and governance.9 \n \n11.  Investment program. The total investment requirement for Assam\u2019s power sector for \nFY2012\u2013FY2022 is about $3.5 billion. The investment program selected a portion of the total \nrequirement, considering the priority needs. At $430 million, the investment program represents \napproximately 12% of the overall investment requirement of the Assam power sector. It will \nfinance investments for physical infrastructure development to (i) augment in-state generation \ncapacity through the replacement of a less-efficient gas-fired generating plant at Lakwa and \nconstruction of a new hydropower plant at Lower Kopili; and (ii) continue to address distribution \nloss  reduction  and  efficiency  improvement  through  renovation  and  modernization  of  the \ndistribution system. The program will also finance nonphysical components to achieve long-term \ninstitutional and financial sustainability of the power utilities.  \n \n12.  Major  lessons  from  previous  ADB  interventions  in  Assam  are  incorporated  in  the \nprogram design and include the need for (i) connectivity of the Assam grid to the northeast \nregion, (ii) capacity building for power companies, (iii) continuous efforts to reduce losses,  \n(iv) increased in-state power generation capacity, and (v) strengthening of the Assam regulatory \nagency. ADB\u2019s ongoing investment program in Assam invests mainly in improving connectivity \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2003.

The proposed \ninvestment program complements ongoing assistance by focusing mainly on generation and \ncapacity building.10 \n \n13.  Multitranche  financing  facility.  The  weak  capacity  of  power  institutions  in  Assam \nrequires long-term engagement in the sector to help achieve its long-term objective: universal \naccess to power. The MFF is the most suitable funding modality to support the investment \nprogram. First, it frontloads a major share of the analytical work, and then blends physical with \nnonphysical investments for better development impacts than any other available modality. \nSecond, the MFF modality provides up-front support for GOA\u2019s substantial investment plan with \nfinancial commitments sequenced to match project readiness, allowing the executing agencies \nand  ADB  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  project  implementation.  Third,  the  MFF  modality \nsupports high project readiness (such as design work and safeguard plans being executed up \nfront) and offers critical mass, continuity, and predictability in relation to funding. Finally, all the \nbasic preconditions for the use of an MFF are in place, including a sound policy framework and \nroad map, well-designed investment and financing plans, an agreement on the treatment of \nsafeguard policies and procedures, and a financial management and governance framework. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The investment program\u2019s impact will be increased availability of electricity in Assam. \nThe outcome will be increased capacity and efficiency of energy generation and distribution \nsystems in Assam. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The investment program will have three outputs: (i) upgraded and expanded generation \nsystem,  (ii)  upgraded  and  expanded  distribution  system,  and  (iii)  strengthened  institutional \ncapacity of APGC and APDC. Output 1 includes (i) replacement of less-efficient and old open-\ngas-cycle turbines with more efficient reciprocating internal combustion gas engines with 70 MW \ncapacity; and (ii) construction of a hydropower plant with 120 MW capacity. Output 2 includes \nconstruction or upgrading of 30 33/11 kilovolt (kV) substations and about 100 km of 11 kV \ndistribution  lines.  Output  3  has  three  major  subcomponents:  (i)  project  preparation  and \nimplementation  support,  (ii)  enterprise  resource  planning  (ERP)  support,  and  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding  and  training.  Project  preparatory  support  will  be  provided  for  the  Lower  Kopili \nhydropower plant under tranche 3 of the MFF, and implementation support will be provided for \nthe Lakwa Gas Power Plant Project under tranche 1. ERP support includes hardware and \nsoftware  components  to  introduce  a  computerized  management  system  for  APGC  under \ntranche 1. Capacity building and training will be provided for financial management, accounting \nand auditing, project management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, human resource \nmanagement, demand-side management, and social and environment safeguards. Tranche 1 \nwill finance Lakwa power plant replacement and institutional capacity strengthening.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2009.

Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n16.  The investment program is estimated to cost $430 million (Table 2). The government \nhas requested an MFF in an amount up to $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will comprise three tranches, subject to \nthe government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related \nloan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,11 a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements.  \n \nTable 2: Investment Program ($ million) \nInvestment  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3 \nItem  Program  (2014)  (2015)  (2016) \nA.

The gas supply to Lakwa is erratic because the gas supplied is associate gas from \noil production. The internal combustion engine can maintain high plant efficiency and better \nplant gross heat rate with erratic gas supplies. Similar analyses of projects proposed under \ntranches 2 and 3 will be undertaken. Preliminary assessment of climate change risks of the \nhydropower subproject in tranche 3 shows that such risks would be minimal, as climate change \nmay not significantly impact the overall monsoon potential.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The investment program will benefit about 2.76 million electricity consumers by reducing \nload shedding. It will enable many households and business establishments to improve their \neconomic, commercial, educational, and entertainment opportunities. The generation projects \nwill strengthen APDC\u2019s financial position by avoiding the purchase of expensive power from \nindependent power producers. The economic viability of the tranche 1 investment is confirmed \nthrough a cost\u2013benefit analysis conducted using ADB guidelines for economic analysis. The \ntranche 1 project replaces gas turbines that are at the end of their economic lifespan and \nexpensive to operate. The economic benefits of this replacement will accrue primarily as a \nconsequence of reduced gas consumption at the generating plant from improved technical \nefficiency. In addition, incremental power generation will result from the additional 10 MW \ncapacity.  The  run-of-the-river  type  hydropower  plant  under  tranche  3  provides  additional \nbenefits of avoided carbon dioxide emissions (534,000 tons per annum)14 and avoided local air \npollution. Economic analysis uses only the benefits of gas savings from the tranche 1 project. \nWith this conservative assumption, the economic internal rate of return of the gas power plant \nreplacement is estimated to be 17.3%. Sensitivity analysis and switching values show that the \ntranche 1 project\u2019s economic benefits are stable against the major risk factors. \n \n23.  Assessment of the financial viability of the tranche 1 project used ADB guidelines. \nIncremental cash flow accruing to APGC from the tranche 1 investment is considered as the \nfinancial benefit of the project. The project has an estimated financial internal rate of return of \n5.5% (post-tax real) against a weighted average cost of capital of 2.7%.15 Sensitivity analysis \nshows that the financial internal rate of return is robust against cost increases and project \nimplementation delays. However, it is sensitive to power output decrease. Gas supply, one of \nthe main determinants of tranche 1 outputs, should be assured to reduce the risk of decreased \noutput. \n \n                                                \n13  Climate Change: Project Adaptation Action Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB estimated the carbon emission reduction. \n15  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  The governance risks for APGC and APDC, including their financial management and \nprocurement capacities, were assessed. The accounting, financial management, and internal \naudit functions in both entities, especially APGC,  are noted to be weak. Overall, financial \nmanagement risk is assessed as high. The financial management risk mitigation includes (i) the \ncapacity  building  component  of  the  investment  program,  which  specifically  targets  the \nweaknesses of the utilities\u2019 financial management; (ii) implementation of time-bound action \nplans provided by APGC and APDC to address major financial management shortcomings \nhighlighted by the statutory auditors; (iii) specific covenants on financial management aspects in \nthe loan agreements; and (iv) use of the direct payment method to expedite disbursement and \nease the administrative burden imposed on APDC and APGC. APGC has a contract and \nawards department. Currently, the PMU handles procurement; it has four qualified staff who \nhave received procurement capacity training from ADB.  \n \n25.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to examine and review directly any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, \nor coercive practices relating to the MFF and the projects. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) were explained to and \ndiscussed with the government, GOA, APGC, and APDC. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 12).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The social assessment notes that the power sector has significant potential to contribute \nto economic development and social well-being, and is both directly and indirectly linked to \npoverty  reduction.  A  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  supply  improves  living  conditions, \npromotes  business  expansion,  and  increases employment  opportunities,  which  will  have  a \npositive impact on poverty reduction. A good quality, reliable electricity supply is important in \nmeeting the basic human needs of health and education. Poor and vulnerable consumers, as \nwell  as  public  institutions  such  as  public  hospitals  and  schools,  are  often  particularly \ndisadvantaged by an inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. They will \ntherefore benefit directly from projects under the MFF. Tranche 1 is classified as having no \ngender  elements;  tranche  2  may  have  opportunities  for  gender  mainstreaming.  The  loan \nagreement  includes  a  standard  assurance  related  to  core  labor  standards  for  contractors \n(including equal pay for equal types of work), and an awareness program on HIV/AIDS and \nsexually transmitted diseases.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  An environment assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \nindigenous peoples planning framework (IPPF) were prepared, outlining the environment and \nsocial safeguard principles and requirements.16 APGC and APDC will undertake environmental \nand  social  safeguard  due  diligence  on  individual  projects  under  the  MFF,  and  submit \nsemiannual reports on the implementation of the environmental management plans (EMPs) \nand, if required, the resettlement plans and indigenous peoples plans (IPPs).  \n \n                                                \n16  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, Resettlement Framework, and Indigenous Peoples Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n28.  Environment (category B). The tranche 1 project is categorized B for environment. The \nADB  project  preparatory  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report, \nincorporating procedures for disposal of the obsolete plant, an EMP for disposal, cost estimates \nfor the EMP, and a grievance redress mechanism. APGC and the ADB project preparatory team \nundertook public consultations as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009).17 The \ngas  power  plant  replacement  project  is  not  located  in  the  vicinity  of  any  environmentally \nsensitive areas. No significant air, water, noise, or soil pollution will result from replacement of \nthe old plant. The potential adverse environmental impacts due to the project are envisaged to \nbe minimal. Any adverse impacts can be readily mitigated using standard engineering and \nenvironmental  practices  incorporated  in  the  EMP.  The  IEE  for  the  tranche  1  project  was \ndisclosed on the ADB and APGC websites. Tranche 2 (upgrading of power distribution system) \nis likely to be environment category B and tranche 3 (hydropower plant) is likely to be category \nA.  \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement (category  C). The tranche 1 project is categorized C for \nresettlement impacts in accordance with the SPS. The proposed replacement of the existing  \n60 MW plant will be undertaken within the existing premises of the Lakwa thermal power station \ncomplex, utilizing the vacant 2.9 hectares available within the complex. No additional land is \nrequired,  and  hence,  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  envisioned.  Therefore,  no \nresettlement  plan  is  required  for  tranche  1;  a  social  due  diligence  report  was  prepared.  \nTranche 2 is likely to be category B for involuntary resettlement and tranche 3 likely category A \ndue  to  the  hydropower  plant  with  an  estimated  26  families  to  be  physically  displaced.  A \nresettlement framework was prepared in accordance with national and state laws and policies \nand the SPS, and disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The impacts of the tranche 1 project on indigenous \npeoples are classified as category C. An IPPF was prepared in accordance with national and \nstate laws and policies and the SPS, and disclosed on the ADB website. Social assessments \nconducted  during  project  preparation  did  not  find  any  indigenous  peoples  who  would  be \nimpacted by tranche 1 project activities. If any project impact on indigenous peoples is found \nduring project implementation, project authorities will formulate an IPP in accordance with the \nIPPF. The project authorities will submit the IPP to ADB for review and approval. If future \ntranche for hydropower impact indigenous peoples or tribes, a standalone IPP or a combined \nresettlement plan and IPP will be prepared in accordance with the IPPF.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \ninvestment program are expected to outweigh the costs of the risk mitigating measures.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial management systems, internal audit  The executing agencies prepared time-bound action \nprocedures, and asset accounting and management; and  plans to rectify financing management issues.
