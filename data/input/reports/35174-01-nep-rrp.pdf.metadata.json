EFA aims to (i) increase equity of access to education and \nsocial  inclusion;  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance;  and  (iii) \nenhance efficiency and institutional capacity. \n \nAs  the  country  is  emerging  from  years  of  conflict  following  the \nchanges in the political context since April 2006, Nepal is poised \nto  enter  a  new  era  of  development  that  has  raised  people\u2019s \nexpectations  and  demands  with  respect  to  the  delivery  of  good \nquality  education.  The  education  system  is  under  pressure  to \nfurther improve its services beyond what has been achieved so far \nunder  EFA.  Within  this  changing  context,  the  Government  of \nNepal recognizes that 5 years of basic education is not sufficient \nand  intends  to  extend  basic  education  coverage  to  grades  1\u20138 \nand  secondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  The  Government  also \nintends  to  improve  synergies  between  basic  education  and \nsecondary  education  to  achieve  a  more  holistic  approach  to \nschool education.  \n \nThe Government has prepared a draft school sector reform (SSR) \ncore document which will guide the preparation and the transition \nfrom  the  current  subsector  approach,  with  education  financed  by \nprograms such as EFA, to an integrated school sector.  \n\n\fThe  draft  core  document  provides  an  overview  of  policy  intents \nand strategic options for an integrated school system. It provides \nthe  rationale  for  extending  basic  education  to  grades  1\u20138,  and \nsecondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  It  also  takes  a  holistic \napproach  to  school  education  by  integrating  early  childhood \ndevelopment, \nformal  education,  alternative  education,  and \ntechnical  education.  The  core  document  details  the  technical, \nmanagerial,  regulatory,  and  financial  issues,  and  the  challenges \ninvolved in  developing an integrated education system. The draft \ncore  document  contains  a  well-articulated  and  clear  vision  for \nSSR. It provides a solid basis for further elaboration of the reform \nprocess. \n \nThe core document acknowledges the achievements of EFA and \nthe  national  movement  that  it  has  created.  SSR  is  viewed  as  a \ncombination  of  affirmative  actions  and  policy  changes  aimed  at \nattaining  the  EFA  goals  by  2015.  At  the  same  time,  SSR  builds \nupon lessons learned from EFA and attempts to address systemic \nissues that impede the progress of the education system. \n \nThe preparation of a comprehensive reform program such as SSR \nis a complex and lengthy process that requires several important \nsteps.  The  Government  has  prepared  an  initial  SSR  transitional \nplan  that  sets  immediate  (2007),  medium-term  (2010),  and  long-\nterm (2015\u20132016) outcomes and outputs for the key policy reform \nareas  for  SSR.  Planned  actions  under  the  transitional  plan \nbetween  2007  and  2010  include  the  preparation  of  regulatory \nframeworks,  policy  guidelines,  norms  and  standards,  and \noperational  procedures.  It  also  includes  a  model-building  of  the \nextension  of  basic  education  from  grades  1\u20135  to  grades  1\u20138  in \nselected \ncapacity-\ndevelopment  requirements  at  all  levels  are  to  be  identified,  and \ncapacity development initiated. \n \nIt  is  expected  that  lessons  learned  and  experiences  gained  from \nimplementation of grade 1\u20138 basic education in selected districts \nand  schools  will  result  in  an  improved  and  final  SSR  core \ndocument. The final core document will guide the implementation \nof an SSR program expected to start in FY2010. It will serve as a \npolicy and planning guide for gradual introduction of the grade 1\u2013\n12 integrated system throughout the country. \n\nstakeholders\u2019 \n\nFurthermore, \n\ndistricts. \n\nii \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiii \n \n\nto  prepare  and \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  launched  the  Education \nSector  Program  (ESP)  cluster  and  approved  its  first  subprogram \nfor  an  amount  of  $30  million  on  1  December  2006.  The  ESP \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  school  sector  reform  (SSR),  which \naims to restructure the school system into an integrated grade 1\u2013\n12  system  in  a  phased  manner.  The  expected  outcome  of  the \nESP  is  a  more  equitable,  inclusive,  effective,  and  holistic \neducation system.  \n \nThe ESP adopted an innovative program cluster design to allow a \nphased  approach \nimplement  SSR.  Three \nsubprograms  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  accordance \nwith the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 to 2012. \n \nThe ESP subprogram I supports the ongoing Nepal EFA program \n(2004\u20132009)  for  basic  and  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135).  A \ncapacity-development  grant  of  $2  million  complements  the  ESP \nsubprogram  I  to  develop  Government  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  in \npolicy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the \npreparation of an SSR core document.  \n \nThe ESP subprogram II will support the preparation and transition \nto  SSR,  in  particular  a  model-building  exercise  of  the  basic \neducation  extension  to  grades  1\u20138  in  a  few  districts,  as  well  as \nbroad capacity development for system readiness. The draft SSR \ncore  document  will  be  further  developed  and  is  expected  to  be \naccepted  by  the  Government,  development  partners  and  other \nstakeholders.  It  is  expected  that  lessons  learned  from  the  ESP \nsubprogram II will help the Government implement a countrywide \ngrade 1\u20138 restructuring.  \n \nThe  ESP  subprogram  III  will  support  full  implementation  of  the \nSSR once the core document is finalized, financed, and the legal, \ngovernance, and financing framework is adjusted to a grade 1\u201312 \nschool system. \n \n \nThe expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including \nthe  ESP  subprogram  II,  is  enhanced  educational  attainment  and \nlivelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and  disadvantaged \ngroups. The expected outcome of ESP subprogram II is a broadly \naccepted  and  adequately  financed  SSR  policy,  program,  and \nfinancing framework. \n \n \n\nProgram Cluster \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\nto  contribute \n\nthe  Department  of  Education  (DOE) \n\nThe Government has requested a program grant of $8 million from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \nthe  SSR \ntransitional  plan.  In  parallel  with  the  ADB  grant,  as  part  of  the \nEuropean  Commission  contribution  to  the  school  sector,  the \nEuropean Commission will provide a program grant of \u20ac6 million to \nsupport  organizational  capacity-development  activities,  both  within \nkey  sector  institutions  in  the  country  and  with  major  stakeholders \nand  communities.  All  EFA  development  partners  have  agreed  to \njointly  finance  the  Program  within  the  existing  EFA  joint  financing \narrangement (JFA).  \n \n \nThe  ESP  subprogram  II  will  be  implemented  over  4  years  from \nJanuary  2008  to  December  2011.  It  is  expected  that  program \ncompletion  will  be  in  December  2011  and  the  grant  closing  date \nwill  be  June  2012.  The  grant  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche \nupon  grant  effectiveness.  All  tranche  release  conditions  have \nbeen met. \n \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  is  the  Executing \nAgency  and \nthe \nImplementing Agency. A central-level coordination committee has \nbeen  established  at  MOES  to  effectively  coordinate  and  monitor \nSSR  capacity-development  activities  implemented  by  various \nMOES  line  agencies.  The  EFA\u2019s  JFA  will  be  amended  to \nincorporate  SSR  transitional  activities  under  ESP  subprogram  II. \nReporting  and  monitoring  of  progress  on  SSR \ntransitional \nactivities  will  be  fully  integrated  into  the  ongoing  reporting  and \nmonitoring activities under EFA. \n \nThe  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to \nbe  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater \nthan  the  amount  of  the  grant  expected  to  be  disbursed  during \nsuch  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this \nformula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \naudit  the  use  of  grant  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  will  be  on  the  basis  of  standard \nGovernment procurement and recruitment practices acceptable to \nADB  for  procurement  and  recruitment  by  the  Government  or  its \nrepresentatives. \n \n\nis \n\n\fCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nv \n \n\nThe  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram grant will be used by the Government to contribute to the \ncost associated with implementation of the SSR transitional plan. \n \nESP  II  will  benefit  the  children  and  youth  of  Nepal,  particularly \nthose  who  would  otherwise  be  denied  a  quality  and  affordable \neducation. Through the model building of the 1\u20138 basic education \nin  selected  districts  and \nthrough  system-wide  capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  education  key  stakeholders,  the  education \nsystem  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  successfully  implement  the \nSSR reform on a countrywide basis in FY2010. This will ultimately \nresult  in  an  education  system  that  is  capable  of  providing  better \nquality  education,  resulting  in  enhanced  educational  attainment \nand livelihoods for all children, particularly girls and disadvantaged \ngroups. \n \nPotential delay in the political transition may delay some aspects \nof  the  reform  process.  Strategies  related  to  some  areas  of \neducation governance, financing, and structure may be decided at \na  later  stage.  However,  the  model-building  exercise,  capacity-\ndevelopment  activities  and  further  preparation  in  key  education \nreform  areas  of  quality  improvement  and  assurance,  and  social \ninclusion,  do  not  require  the  political  process  to  be  finalized,  and \nhence  will  not  be  affected.  Anticorruption  measures  under  ESP \nsubprogram  II  will  follow  the  provisions  under  the  EFA\u2019s  JFA. \nParticularly,  EFA  partners  endorsed  a  financial  management \nimprovement  action  plan  prepared  by  DOE.  The  EFA  midterm \nreview  concluded  that  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting \nprocedures  under  the  JFA  comply  with  fiduciary  requirements  in \nan  acceptable  manner.  Measures \nfinancial \nmanagement  pertinent  to  timely  disbursement  to  districts  and \nschools  and  submission  of  the  financial  monitoring  report,  (ii) \nsimplify and clarify guidelines, and (iii) strengthen monitoring and \ncoordination  mechanisms  at  all  levels,  are  being  undertaken  by \nDOE. DOE\u2019s financial management improvement action plan also \ncomprises  capacity  development  in  social  auditing  and  school \nauditing.  Both  ESP  subprograms  I  and  II  have  provisions  to \nsupport such capacity development.    \n \n \n\nimprove \n\nto  (i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n\f\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  Nepal  for  subprogram  II  of  the  Education  Sector  Program  (ESP)  Cluster.  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n  \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nThe Program Cluster and Timing of Subprograms \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  launched  the  ESP  and  approved  its  first \nsubprogram  for  an  amount  of  $30  million  on  1  December  2006.1  The  Government  recognizes \nthat  5  years  of  basic  education  are  not  sufficient  and  intends  to  extend  basic  education \ncoverage  to  grades  1\u20138  and  secondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  The  Government  also \nintends  to  improve  synergies  between  basic  education  and  secondary  education  to  achieve  a \nmore holistic approach to school education. The ESP supports the Government\u2019s school sector \nreform  (SSR),  which  aims  to  restructure  the  school  system  into  an  integrated  grade  1\u201312 \nsystem in a phased manner. The expected outcome of the ESP is a more equitable, inclusive, \neffective, and holistic education system.  \n \nThe ESP adopted an innovative program cluster design to allow a phased approach to \n3. \nprepare  and  implement  SSR.  Three  subprograms  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  time  frame  and  progress  of  the  SSR  from  2007  to  2012.  The  ESP \nsubprogram  I  supports  the  ongoing  Nepal  Education  for  All  (EFA)  program  (2004\u20132009)  for \nbasic  and  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135).  A  capacity-development  grant  of  $2  million \ncomplements  the  ESP  subprogram  I  to  develop  Government  stakeholders\u2019  capacity  in  policy \nanalysis,  formulation,  and  coordination.  It  also  supports  the  preparation  of  an  SSR  core \ndocument.  The  ESP  subprogram  II  will  support  the  preparation  and  transition  to  the  SSR,  in \nparticular  a  model-building  exercise  of  the  basic  education  extension  to  grades  1\u20138  in  a  few \ndistricts,  as  well  as  broad  capacity  development  for  system  readiness.  The  draft  SSR  core \ndocument  will  be  further  developed  and  is  expected  to  be  accepted  by  the  Government, \ndevelopment partners and other stakeholders. It is expected that lessons learned from the ESP \nsubprogram II will help the Government implement a countrywide grade 1\u20138 restructuring. The \nESP  subprogram  III  will  support  full  implementation  of  the  SSR  once  the  core  document  is \nfinalized, financed, and the legal, governance, and financing framework is adjusted to a grade \n1\u201312 school system. \n \n4. \nThe  timing  of  the  subprograms  will  not  precisely  follow  a  sequential  order  but  will \noverlap. The ESP subprogram I supports the EFA program from FY2007 to FY2009. The ESP \nsubprogram II will start in 2008, towards the end of the EFA implementation, and will initiate the \ntransition  towards  the  SSR  program.  This  is  because  the  preparation  for  SSR  needs  to  start \nearly, so that lessons learned from the model building can be integrated into the new SSR. As \nthe  EFA  and  the  Secondary  Education  Support  Project  (grades  6\u201310)2  will  end  by  FY2009,  a \nnew  SSR  program  covering  grades  1\u201312  is  expected  to  start  the  same  year.  The  ESP \nsubprogram  III  will  therefore  start  in  FY2010  to  support  the  SSR  program.  Figure  1  describes \nthe sequencing of the subprograms.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

EFA \nis  Nepal\u2019s  first  truly  program-based  approach  in  education  under  which  development  partners \npool  funds  and  use  country  systems  and  fully  harmonized  procedures  for  their  contributions. \nCore financing of EFA is through a joint financing arrangement (JFA) under which development \npartners3 provide budgetary support to EFA. Program activities and budget items are mutually \nagreed upon by EFA partners before the beginning of each fiscal year, through a review of an \nannual rolling plan, the annual strategic implementation plan (ASIP), and the annual work plan \nand  budget  (AWPB).  Development  partners'  annual  commitments  are  based  on  outcome  and \nprocess performance indicators.  \n \n6. \nThe  ESP  is  one  of  the  most  far-reaching  programs  in  terms  of  alignment  with \ngovernment  procedures  and  donor  harmonization  in  education,  and  the  first  program-based \napproach supported by ADB. The ESP uses program lending and adjusts it to program-based \napproach  features.  As  such,  ESP  tranche  releases  are  contingent  upon  annually  agreed \nprogram outcomes and progress rather than policy milestones. The ESP also marked a radical \nchange  in  ADB  assistance  in  education  in  Nepal  from  a  project  approach  to  a  multipartner \nprogram-based approach.   \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  ESP  subprogram  II  design  follows  key  ESP  cluster  program  features  with  little \nchange  in  the  intended  policy  and  program  actions.  Therefore,  this  report  updates  the \n                                                 \n3  As  of  FY2007,  joint  financing  arrangement  (JFA)  partners  are  ADB,  Denmark,  Finland,  Norway,  United  Kingdom, \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  World  Bank.  The  European  Commission  intends  to  join  JFA  from \nFY2008. The non-JFA partners who provide parallel financing to EFA are Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and World Food Programme.  \n\nSubprogram II Presentation  \n\n\f3 \n \n\nmacroeconomic  and  political  situation  and  the  progress  of  ESP  subprogram  I  implementation, \nand  describes  ESP  subprogram  II  details  including  the  updated  policy  matrix.  Other  technical \nanalyses and program implementation arrangements pertinent to the ESP cluster program have \nnot changed since the approval of ESP subprogram I and therefore may be found in the ESP \nsubprogram I report and recommendation of the President (footnote 1). \n\n  \n\n \nTHE MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT  \n\nIII. \n\nDespite political uncertainty, Nepal has achieved broad macroeconomic stability over the \n8. \npast 5 years. Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth during 2003\u20132007 averaged 2.7% \nand  inflation  was  5.5%.  Economic  growth  is  expected  to  increase  in  anticipation  of  further \nstabilization of the political process, which holds promise of sustained peace and a transition to \na more productive economy. Per capita GDP reached $312 in 2006, compared to $241 in 2001. \nIn  addition  to  a  consolidation  of  the  peace  process,  the  country  will  also  require  increased \nresource mobilization and productivity gains in order to achieve higher sustainable growth. An \ninvestor-friendly  climate  would  create  more  employment,  generate  technological  benefits,  and \ncontribute  to  overall  economic  competitiveness,  while  a  skilled  labor  force  would  contribute  to \nraising domestic productivity.  \n \n9. \nThe  nonagricultural  sector  is  gradually  diversifying  and  creating  higher-paying  jobs.  In \naddition,  an  increasing  number  of  people  are  seeking  employment  abroad.  Remittances\u2014\namounting  to  $1.3  billion,  or  15%  of  GDP,  in  2006\u2014are  one  of  the  country\u2019s  major  income \nsources and have helped improve the living standards of a large number of people. Appropriate \ntraining opportunities for workers abroad are needed under the reform process in education.   \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  3-year  interim  plan  for  FY2008\u2013FY20104  puts  special  emphasis  on \n10. \nincreasing  public  expenditure  to  enhance  employment,  as  well  as  on  peace  building, \nreconstruction,  rehabilitation,  reintegration,  inclusion,  and  revitalization  of  the  economy.  The \nannual average economic growth rate for the interim plan period is projected to be 5.5%. \n \n11.  Within this context, the Government recognizes the importance of the education sector. \nEducation is the largest sector within the government budget. For FY2008, NRs28.07 billion out \nof  a  total  budget  of  NRs168.99  billion  is  allocated  to  the  education  sector.  This  represents \n16.6% of the total budget, up from just under 16.0% in FY2007.  \n \n12. \nOn the political front, the country underwent a political transformation following the April \n2006 ceasefire. As a result of a popular movement, the parliament was restored. Subsequently, \nin November 2006 a comprehensive peace accord was signed between a seven-party alliance \nand  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal  (Maoist).  An  interim  constitution  was  agreed  on  18 \nDecember  2006,  promulgated  on  the  first  day  of  the  formation  of  the  interim  parliament  (15 \nJanuary 2007) and amended twice\u2014in March and June 2007. The interim constitution has the \nfollowing  provisions  pertinent  to  education:  (i) each  community  will  have  the  right  to  receive \nbasic  education  in  its  mother  language,  and  (ii) each  citizen  will  have  the  right  to  receive  free \neducation up to the secondary level as provided by law. \n \n13. \nIn  mid-September  2007,  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal  (Maoist)  withdrew  from  the \ninterim  government,  and  constituent  assembly  elections  originally  scheduled  for  22  November \n2007  were  postponed  until  mid-April  2008.  However,  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal  (Maoist) \n\n                                                 \n4\n National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2007. Three-Year Interim Plan FY2008\u2013FY2010. Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\nremains  part  of  the  seven-party  alliance  and  continues  to  abide  by  the  principles  of  the \ncomprehensive peace accord.  \n \n14. \nThe  constituent  assembly  will  be  tasked  with  writing  a  new  constitution  in  line  with  the \nvision  of  a  decentralized  political  structure  for  Nepal.  Political  consensus  about  a  move  to \ndecentralization is broad. The precise form and extent of decentralization will be subject to the \noutcome  of  the  political  process.  At  this  stage,  it  is  not  yet  clear  precisely  what  government \nfunctions will be decentralized. A highly decentralized system could imply the decentralization of \nall  state  functions,  except  a  number  of  core  functions  such  as  finance,  foreign  policy,  and \ndefense.  This  would  imply  also  that  education  would  become  the  responsibility  of  the \ndecentralized  system,  with  possibly  only  a  central  education  board  remaining  a  national \nresponsibility.  Other  less  drastic  forms  of  a  decentralized  state  would  continue  to  include \neducation  as  a  national  responsibility.  The  educational  governance  system  will  need  to  be \naligned with changes in the overall government structure. \n \n15. \nThe  political  changes  in  the  country  have  improved  the  chances  for  lasting  peace  and \nthe  creation  of  a  prosperous,  peaceful,  and  inclusive  Nepal.  The  changes  have  also  raised \npeople\u2019s expectations and demands with respect to public services. Demand from the people for \nan  equitable  delivery  of  good  quality  education  is  increasing.  The  educational  management \nsystems  at  various  levels,  including  the  schools,  are  under  pressure  to  respond  to  these \nemerging  challenges  by  improving  their  services.  The  restoration  of  peace  has  created  an \natmosphere more conducive to educational reconstruction and development. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SUBPROGRAM I \n\nProgram Implementation \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nEducation For All Outcome Progress  \n\n16. \nEFA  is  currently  in  its  third  year  of  implementation.  An  EFA  midterm  review  was \nconducted in May 2007, with national stakeholders and all EFA development partners. Overall, \nthe  midterm  review  concluded  that  access  to  schools  has  improved  considerably,  but \nchallenges  remain  in  improving  the  quality  and  social  and  geographic  equity  of  basic  and \nprimary  education.  Findings  of  the  midterm  review  on  outcomes  of  the  EFA  program  are \nsummarized below. Appendix 2 contains a table with the status of EFA indicators.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEarly childhood development (ECD) centers have expanded, as is evident in the \nproportion  of  grade  1  students  with  ECD  experience,  which  has  increased  from \n8% in 2001 to 18.3% in 2006. The percentage of dalit5 children enrolled in grade \n1  with  ECD  experience  is  17.3%;  for  janajati6  children  the  figure  is  21.0%.  For \nother  social  groups  the  proportion  of  grade  1  students  with  ECD  experience  is \n16.5%.  \nEnrolment,  including  enrolment  of  girls,  has  increased.  This  has  led  to  an \nincrease  in  the  net  enrolment  rate,  from  81%  in  2001  to  87.4%  in  2006.  The \npercentage of dalit enrolments is 17.7%, janajati enrolments are 38%, while other \nsocial groups account for the remaining 44.3%. The gender parity index has also \nincreased, from 0.6 in 2001 to 0.94 in 2006. The primary-level enrolment for girls \nis  48%  of  the  total  enrolment.  The  percentage  of  girls\u2019  enrolment  in  mountain \ndistricts is 47.5%, in hill districts 49.7%, and in Terai districts 47.2%.  \n\n                                                 \n5 Historically disadvantaged occupational caste group. \n6 Ethnic minority group. \n\n\f5 \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  rapid  increase  in  enrolment  has  also  resulted  in  an  increased  gross \nenrolment  rate,  from  123%  in  2001  to  138.8%  in  2006,  which  puts  the  schools \nunder enormous pressure. The situation is of great concern, especially in grade 1 \nwhere the gross intake rate is 148%.  \nThe total survival rate to grade 5 is 80.3%, up from 66% in 2001. It is 77.4% for \ngirls and 83.0% for boys. The survival rate ranges from 61.5% in the central Terai \ndistricts to 95.2% in the Kathmandu Valley. \nThe  student\u2013teacher  ratio  has  increased  from  39:1  in  2001  to  45.2:1  in  2006, \ndespite the allocation of additional teachers. The highest student\u2013teacher ratio is \nin the Terai (58.1:1) while the lowest is in the Kathmandu Valley (16.2:1). \nThe  percentage  of  trained  teachers  has  increased  rapidly,  from  15%  of  all \nteachers in 2001 to 59.9% in 2006. \nThere is no information on learning achievement. A grade 5 national assessment \nconducted in 2003 showed improvements in learning achievement, but this data \nhas not yet been brought up to date. \n\n \nThe midterm review recognized the progress of EFA in increased participation, including \n17. \nthat of girls, the number of trained teachers, and the grade 5 survival rate. It also acknowledged \nEFA's  contribution  to  keeping  the  school  system  operating  during  the  insurgency  period.  The \nschool system has demonstrated the robustness of service, even as the country has emerged \nfrom years of conflict. This is also despite the changing political situation and confusion caused \nby  2  years  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  direction  of  fundamental  changes  in  the  political \nenvironment. EFA as a national movement has supported the system in meeting the immediate \nneeds in education during this difficult period. \n  \n18. \n\nThe midterm review findings also outlined the following challenges. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAccess  to  education  has  increased  but  in  some  areas  this  has  been  at  the \nexpense of quality of service delivery and efficiency. For instance, an increasing \ngross enrolment rate has caused crowding of schools and burdens on teachers, \nwho could then not teach adequately. A relative decline in service delivery in turn \nresulted in an increased drop-out rate at grade 1.  \nAs  completion  and  transition  rates  increase,  there  is  a  risk  of  widening  gaps \nbetween  the  socially  disadvantaged  groups  and  those  in  poor  and  remote \ndistricts, and the rest of the country.  \nThe correlation between certain inputs and outcomes needs to be strengthened \nfurther. For instance, an increase in the number of ECD centers is not sufficiently \nreflected in an increase in grade 1 students with ECD experience, nor in a better \nsurvival rate of such students at grade 1.  \nLearning  achievement  is  a  core  EFA  performance  indicator  to  measure  quality. \nHowever,  a  reliable  and  standardized  learning  achievement  test  is  yet  to  be \ndeveloped in Nepal. \n\n \n19. \nThe above-mentioned issues provide some key lessons for a review of policy, strategy, \nand prioritization of resources in education under the future SSR: (i) how to meet public demand \nfor  education  by  increasing  access  to  basic  and  primary  education  and  at  the  same  time \nimproving  quality  of  service  delivery  and  internal  efficiency;  (ii)  how  to  ensure  social  inclusion \nwhile  maintaining  a  broader  national  target  for  education;  and  (iii)  how  to  develop  evidence-\nbased planning and management at all levels, based on a clear accountability mechanism that \nincludes  the  development  of  sound  performance  indicators  to  measure  quality  and  education \noutcomes.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEducation For All Implementation Strategies and Program Management  \n\nThe  midterm  review  concluded \n\n20. \nimplementation  strategies  of \ndecentralization,  inclusion,  and  capacity  building  remain  relevant.  However,  implementation  of \nthese strategies faced the following constraints.  \n\nthat  EFA\u2019s  core \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nGovernance structures could not perform as envisaged because of the unstable \nsocial and political situation. Decentralization has been hampered by disruption, \ninadequate institutional capacity, ineffective communication, and the absence of \nelected members. \nMonitoring  and  supervision  at  district  and  school  levels  have  been  heavily \nconstrained by the effects of the conflict.  \nLocal  stakeholders  faced  difficulties  in  planning,  implementing,  monitoring,  and \nreporting on EFA activities. As a result, differences in outcomes persist between \nand within districts.  \n\n \n21. \nThe midterm review raised concern over the appropriate deployment and redeployment \nof teachers. Teacher allocations should be based on clearer criteria on priorities and needs, so \nthat discrepancies in student\u2013teacher ratios can be reduced. A clear plan on how to reduce the \nteacher disparities and student\u2013teacher ratio is needed.  \n \n22. \nA  financial  management  review  was  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  in  conjunction  with \nthe  midterm  review.  It  concluded  that  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  procedures \nelaborated  in  the  financial  monitoring  report  (FMR)  provide  assurance  that  EFA  complies  with \nfinancial  management  requirements  in  an  acceptable  manner.  However,  there  are  financing \nissues  in  that  disbursements  to  districts  and  schools  (i)  are  often  late,  (ii)  are  sometimes  in \ninappropriate  amounts,  (iii)  sometimes  lack  clarification  on  how  the  amount  has  been \ndetermined, and (iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent.  \n \n23. \nAt  the  process  level,  EFA  has  resulted  in  a  number  of  achievements,  and  has \ndemonstrated  the  usefulness  and  effectiveness  of  donor  harmonization.  The  JFA  has  helped \nharmonize  resources  and  develop  a  culture  of  partnership,  and  has  also  contributed  to \nstrengthening  in-country  capacity  through  greater  reliance  on  country  systems.  Further,  the \ndonor  harmonization  process  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports  (MOES)  in \neducation has been a model for progress in the country. \n \n24. \nThe achievement of EFA is noteworthy for developing a rolling-plan process for the ASIP \nto reflect the ground realities and make strategic choices for program implementation. ASIP has \nalso  encouraged  the  schools  and  districts  to  implement  their  prioritized  programs  based  on \nstrategic  interventions  through  school  improvement  plans  (SIPs)  and  district  education  plans \n(DEPs). However, the mechanism where SIPs feed into village education plans, DEPs, and the \nASIP  has  scope  for  improvement.  Planning  continues  to  be  largely  a  top-down  process  with \nincremental  budgeting  and  no  clear  prioritization  for  districts  or  activities  in  need  of  more \nresources.  \n\n \nThe Education For All Midterm Review Recommendations and Follow-up \n\n3. \n\nThe midterm review recognized that while systemic issues need to be addressed, EFA \n25. \nalso needs to respond to the immediate basic needs of the education system\u2014the provision of \nteachers, classrooms, and textbooks. The midterm review recommended that the Department of \n\n\f7 \n \n\nEducation  (DOE)  clearly  prioritize  and  target  EFA  resource  allocations,  especially  to  the  most \nneeded areas. It also recommended the development of a short- to medium-term plan for more \nequitable  teacher  deployment.  The  midterm  review  agreed  on  the  following  priorities  for  the \nremaining  EFA  implementation  period:  (i)  equitable  provision  of  teachers,  classrooms,  and \ntextbooks;  (ii)  decentralization  to  support  schools,  including  funding  for  community-managed \nschools  and  capacity  development  of  school  management  committees  (SMCs);  (iii)  quality \nimprovement  to  develop  stronger  indicators  to  measure  quality,  and  monitor  and  redefine  the \nmedium of instruction; (iv) inclusion strategies to reach unserviced and underserviced learners; \nand  (v)  improvement  of  management,  including  accountability,  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. These priorities will be reflected in the ASIP for FY2008.    \n \n26. \nFinancial  Management.  DOE  presented  a  short-term  action  plan  to  improve  financial \nmanagement  in  order  to  address  the  following  concerns  raised  by  the  JFA  partners  based  on \nthe FMR: (i) delays in funds release to district offices; (ii) delays in submission of FMRs; (iii) the \nquality of school audits, and (iv) compliance with social audits. The midterm review agreed that \na  committee  will  be  set  up  to  periodically  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  A \nperformance  audit  is  being  conducted  by  the  auditor  general,  focusing on  the  management  of \nscholarships and SIPs. The midterm review agreed that the incentive schemes will be reviewed \nbased on the results of the performance audit.               \n \nThe  midterm  review  recommended  that  systemic  issues\u2014such  as  quality,  governance, \n27. \naccountability,  and  finance\u2014discussed  during  the  meetings,  as  well  as  by  the  earlier  review \nmissions,  will  be  addressed  by  the  thematic  working  groups  under  the  SSR  core  document \nwriting team. The working groups were asked to refer to the midterm review recommendations \nand incorporate them in their respective thematic work. \n \nB. \n \nThe  second  tranche  of  EFA  subprogram  I  has  three  conditions.  These  relate  to  (i)  the \n28. \nperformance  of  program  implementation  in  FY2007  in  relation  to  the  ASIP  FY2007;  (ii)  the \npreparation of ASIP FY2009 by MOES and its endorsement by the JFA partners, including ADB; \nand  (iii)  the  preparation  by  MOES  of  an  action  plan  with  resource  allocation  on  the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the EFA midterm review. A draft ASIP FY2009 and \nthe  status  report  for  FY2007,  including  progress  of  implementation  of  the  midterm  review \nrecommendations,  are  expected  to  be  presented  and  discussed  in  the  annual  EFA  review \nmeeting  in  about  May  2008.  Therefore,  the  second  tranche  release  timing  is  expected  to  be \naround June 2008, after all conditions have been met.     \n \n\nStatus of Second Tranche Release Conditions of Subprogram I \n\nV. \n\nTHE SCHOOL SECTOR REFORM \n\nStatus of the Draft School Sector Reform Core Document \n\n \nA. \n  \n29. \nThe  Government  has  prepared  a  draft  SSR  core  document  which  will  guide  the \npreparation and the transition from the current subsector approach, with education financed by \nprograms such as the EFA and the Secondary Education Support Project, to an integrated SSR. \nThe final core document will guide the implementation of an SSR program expected to start in \nFY2010. It will serve as a policy and planning guide for gradual introduction of the grade 1\u201312 \nintegrated  system.  It  will  clarify  Government  commitments  with  respect  to  the  provision, \npromotion,  and  appraisal  of  educational  services  within  the  framework  of  the  grade  1\u201312 \nsystem.  Major  strategies  relating  to  standards  of  services  and  performance\u2014such  as \nmanagement,  financing,  legal  functions,  and  the  regulatory  framework\u2014will  be  detailed.  The \n\n \n\n\ffinal  core  document  will  describe  operational  procedures  for  delivering  school  education  of  an \nacceptable  quality  in  partnership  with  the  community  and  civil  society.  It  will  contain  details  of \nprograms,  the  financing  framework,  and  implementation.  To  write  the  core  document,  MOES \nmobilized  a  team  composed  of  thematic  groups  related  to  governance  and  management, \nquality, financing, social inclusion, structure, monitoring, and technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT).  \n \n30. \nThe draft core document provides an overview of policy intents and strategic options for \nan integrated school system. It provides the rationale for extending basic education to grades 1\u2013\n8,  and  secondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  It  also  takes  a  holistic  approach  to  school \neducation  by  integrating  ECD,  formal  education,  alternative  education,  and  TEVT.  The  core \ndocument details the technical, managerial, regulatory, and financial issues, and the challenges \ninvolved in developing an integrated education system. The draft core document contains a well \narticulated and clear vision for SSR. It provides a solid basis for further elaboration of the reform \nprocess. \n \nThe core document acknowledges the achievements of EFA and the national movement \n31. \nthat it has created. SSR is viewed as a combination of affirmative actions and policy changes \naimed at attaining the EFA goals by 2015. At the same time, SSR builds upon lessons learned \nfrom EFA and attempts to address systemic issues that impede the progress of the education \nsystem.  As  such,  the  core  document  envisages  a  departure  from  the  current  program  to  a \nsector reform that is more responsive to the reality and needs of the school system. It envisages \na  school  system  that  is  needs-based,  flexible,  and  autonomous.  It  intends  to  provide  multiple \neducational  choices  to  schools  and  communities  with  regard  to  learning  content,  medium  of \ninstruction, learning materials, and delivery methods. It envisages a contractual model between \ncentral  and  local  government  bodies  and  the  schools,  wherein  government  bodies  will  be \nresponsible  for  providing  minimum  enabling  conditions  for  learning,  in  exchange  for  which \nschools  will  be  responsible  for  achieving  an  agreed  standard  for  service  delivery,  learning \nachievements,  and  outcomes.  The  backbone  of  such  a  system  is  (i)  a  clear  set  of  norms  and \nstandards; and (ii) an accountability mechanism that will define the roles, obligations, functions, \nand level of responsibilities at each institutional level.  \n \nAccountability is linked to quality improvement and assurance. Strategies to improve the \n32. \nquality  and  relevance  of  education  have  been  strengthened.  A  prerequisite  is  the  setting  of \nnorms and standards for quality improvement and assurance at all levels. Quality control is to \nbe  assured  through  the  mechanism  of  an  independent  monitoring  body  accountable  to  the \ninterministerial  education  policy  committee  (EPC).  Quality  is  also  to  be  measured  by  learning \noutcomes.  National  and  decentralized  public  school  examinations,  as  well  as  national \nassessment  of  learning  achievement  at  grades  5,  8,  and  10,  are  to  be  conducted,  and \ncontinuous  student  assessment  will  be  introduced.  The  curriculum  will  be  revised  to  make  it \nmore  competency-based.  Teachers\u2019  minimum  qualifications  will  be  redefined  according  to  the \nrestructuring  of  grades  1\u20138  and  grades  9\u201312.  Guidelines  for  teacher  management  and \ndevelopment will be prepared. Strategies to improve the relevance of education to local needs \ninclude multigrade teaching and the development and teaching of local content curriculum.  \n \n33. \nIn  accordance  with  the  interim  constitution,  the  core  document  guarantees  free  basic \neducation  to  all  children  and  encourages  local  governments  to  make  basic  education \ncompulsory.  Responsibilities  for  assuring  equity  of  access  and  social  inclusion  will  be  shared \nbetween levels of government. A range of affirmative actions to support education for girls and \ndisadvantaged  groups  has  been  defined.  The  core  document  proposes  multiple  options  for \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\nThe Core Document Challenges \n\nschool financing, including block grants, performance-based grants, and formula-based school \ngrants.       \n \nB. \n \n34. \nThe  core  document  preparation  comes  after  (i)  a  thorough  process  of  thematic  group \nworks; (ii) a series of central, regional, district, and community-level stakeholder consultations; \nand (iii) periodic review and endorsement of the process by the EPC. Stakeholder consultation \nentails a lengthy process of consensus building among stakeholders with differing backgrounds \nand  interests.  Therefore  the  core  document  at  this  stage  accommodates  the  views  of  various \nstakeholders and suggests multiple options for strategies and operational procedures. With the \npolitical uncertainties, the core document also remains cautious in some policy areas which may \nbe directly influenced by future political and governance structures. As a result, further decisions \nare required and inconsistencies need to be resolved in the draft core document. However, the \nGovernment  vision  and  long-term  goal  for  SSR  is  clear  and  firm.  Consensus  among \nstakeholders  around  basic  principles  of  the  reform  is  strong.  The  challenge  is  to  build \nconsensus  and  deepen  analysis  on  how  to  achieve  SSR  goals  in  a  realistic  and  sustainable \nmanner. The major tasks and challenges will be (i) prioritization of the many areas of suggested \npolicy reforms; (ii) adjustment and streamlining of the multiple strategic options; and (iii) policy \ndecisions  on  phased  and  focused  reform  planning  and  process,  including  securing  adequate \nfinancial resources. \n \n35. \nSome  policy  directions  will  be  subject  to  the  outcomes  of  the  political  process,  the \nensuing  revised  government  structure,  and  the  degree  of  decentralization.  These  policies  are \n(i) education  governance,  including  the  roles  and  mandates  of  local  government  bodies, \ncommunities,  and  schools;  (ii)  the  envisaged  cost-sharing  responsibilities  in  secondary \neducation  versus  the  policy  of  free  secondary  education  as  stated  in  the  interim  constitution; \n(iii) the roles and mandates of private education; and (iv) budget scenarios for the expansion to \na grade 1\u20138 system and eventually an integrated grade 1\u201312 school system. Other key areas in \nthe  core  document  can  be  further  analyzed  and  detailed  without  the  need  for  the  political \nprocess to be finalized. These include (i) finding an appropriate balance between the goals of \nimproving access to, and quality of, education; (ii) establishing suitable incentive, accountability, \nand  performance  monitoring  systems  at  all  levels  (central,  district,  and  SMC);  (iii)  determining \nthe most appropriate forms of affirmative action to enhance social inclusion; and (iv) determining \nan appropriate rationale and strategy for TEVT through formal and nonformal means, including \nthe  possibility  of  adding  a  vocational  stream  in  school  education.  These  issues  are  described \nbelow. \n \n36. \nImproving Education Quality. The core document rightfully stresses the importance of \nimproving the quality of education by modernizing pedagogy, curriculum, teacher skills, learning \nmaterials,  assessment,  and  professional  development  of  teachers  and  head  teachers.  Further \nanalysis  will  need  to  clarify  the  envisaged  balance  between  quantitative  inputs,  such  as \nadditional classrooms and teachers needed for grade 1\u20138 basic education, and inputs which are \nmore  directly  related  to  quality  improvement.  Increased  public  demand  for  education  will \ncontinue  pressuring  the  Government  to  expand  access  to  grade  1\u20138  basic  education.  At  the \nsame time, there will be higher expectations for quality and performance of public schools. SSR \nwill need to ensure that achieving quantitative access targets will not undermine quality targets. \n \n37. \nIncentives  and  Accountability.  International  and  regional  experience  shows  that \nproviding more teachers, classrooms, and textbooks does not necessarily lead to better-quality \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\neducation.  While  additional  inputs  are  necessary,  they  are  not  all  that  is  needed  to  improve \nquality.  The  key  ingredient  stimulating  quality  is  an  appropriate  system  of  accountability  and \nincentives  that  motivates  students, teachers,  and  schools  to  perform  well.  The  core  document \nproposes  to  improve  educational  quality  by  establishing  a  common  threshold  and  minimum \nenabling  conditions,  linked  to  quantitative  inputs,  as  a  guide  for  raising  school  standards. \nSimultaneously, incentives for students and teachers are proposed. Further details on how the \nproposed incentives are expected to contribute to improving the quality of education are to be \ndeveloped.  For  instance,  the  correlation  between  the  incentives  given  to  teachers,  head \nteachers, and SMCs, and the expected increase in the level of school performance, needs to be \nclarified.     \n \n38.  More accountability will lead to better quality only if the districts and SMCs are provided \nwith  adequate  resources  and  incentives  for  the  stakeholders  to  fulfill  their  obligations,  e.g., \nthrough  the  implementation  of  SIPs.  Furthermore,  apart  from  providing  positive  incentives, \nschool  and  educational  performance  must  be  monitored  more  carefully  in  order  to  detect  and \nact upon unsatisfactory fulfillment of obligations. \n \n39. \nSocial Inclusion. Social inclusion remains a key policy reform area. The core document \nemphasizes  the  need  to  improve  the  access  to  education  by  girls  and  disadvantaged  groups \nsuch as dalit, madhesis,7 and mountain communities. Advanced policy and strategy options and \na  range  of  actions,  including  inclusive  education  and  affirmative  actions,  have  been  included. \nThe core document would benefit from further analysis of the implementation progress of, and \nlessons  learned  from,  the  current  EFA  program  in  these  areas.  Policies  designed  to  enhance \nsocial inclusion should be consistent with those designed to raise the quality of education. For \nfrom \nthe  recruitment  of \ninstance,  affirmative  actions \ndisadvantaged groups are to be carefully planned without compromising defined standards for \nteacher qualification.   \n \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training.  Regional  experience  shows  that \n40. \npositive  arguments  and  positive  rates  of  return  for  spending  on  formal  TEVT  can  be  found  in \nstrong economies. In weaker economies, nonformal skills centers can have a much higher rate \nof  return  than  formal  vocational  streams  in  secondary  education.  The  feasibility  of  continuing \ncostly investments in formal TEVT should be carefully considered in order to minimize risks that \nsuch investments will undermine investments in general education. Cost-sharing is necessary. \nThe core document proposes continuation of the current centrally driven TEVT programs, and \nthe addition of vocational streams in secondary education from grade 9 onwards. The proposed \ndelegation  of  authority  of  TEVT  to  local  levels  and  cost  sharing,  including  the  feasibility  of \npublic-private  partnership,  will  need  careful  consideration.  A  strong  economic  argument  is \nneeded for continuing with formal TEVT and adding the vocational stream in school education.     \n \nC. \n \n41. \nThe  Government  has  reviewed  the  core  document,  taking  into  consideration  the  initial \ncomments made by various stakeholders, including the development partners. The revised draft \ncore document has been endorsed by the EPC for wider dissemination and consultation down \nto the school level. It is expected that the draft core document will be forwarded to the National \nPlanning Commission and to the Ministry of Finance for approval in early 2008. Another round \nof consultation meetings may be organized with the development partners in 2008, followed by \none or more joint appraisal missions in 2008\u20132009. It is expected that the SSR policy, program, \n                                                 \n7 Traditional inhabitants of the lowlands (Terai). \n\nThe Core Document Preparation Process and Next Steps     \n\nteachers  and \n\nfemale \n\nthose \n\nfor \n\n\f11 \n \n\nand  financing  framework  will  be  broadly  accepted  and  adequately  financed  by  the  start  of \nFY2010.  The  Government  is  committed  to  making  the  required  policy  decisions  in  a  timely \nmanner  so  that  the  legislative,  governance,  and  financing  structure  can  be  revised  under  a \ngrade 1\u201312 integrated system.  \n \n42. \nPreparation  of  a  successful  reform  program  is  a  complex  and  lengthy  process  that \nrequires  several  important  steps.  Firstly,  the  Government  is  undertaking  broad  stakeholder \nconsultations  at  all  levels,  with  the  aim  of  analyzing  the  demand  for  SSR,  promoting \nparticipation,  and  building  consensus  among  diversified  interests.  These  consultations  involve \ncentral  agencies,  district  and  municipality  government  stakeholders,  village  and  community \nstakeholders, SMCs, parents, political parties, teachers\u2019 unions, women and dalit associations, \nand other civil society groups. Secondly, the Government intends to undertake a model-building \nexercise  of  grade  1\u20138  basic  education  in  selected  districts  to  draw  lessons  in  key  suggested \npolicy  reform  areas.  Thirdly,  the  core  document  approval  process  should  go  through  a  high-\nlevel, single policy coordination, review, and approval mechanism. This mechanism has already \nbeen  established  through  the  interministerial  EPC.  Finally,  the  Government  is  undertaking  an \nearly identification of capacity-development requirements for system readiness to embark on the \nreform.    \n \n43. \nThe  Government  has  prepared  an  initial  SSR  transitional  plan  that  sets  immediate \n(2007),  medium-term  (2010),  and  long-term  (2015\u20132016)  outcomes  and  outputs  for  the  key \npolicy  reform  areas  for  SSR,  which  are  (i)  governance  and  management,  (ii)  quality  of \neducation,  (iii) equity  of  access  and  social  inclusion,  and  (iv)  education  financing.  It  is \nunderstood  that  the  transitional  plan  will  be  revised  along  with  the  revision  of  the  core \ndocument. \n \n44. \nPlanned  actions  under  the  transitional  plan  between  2007  and  2010  include  the \npreparation of regulatory frameworks, policy guidelines, norms and standards, and operational \nprocedures. It also includes a model-building of the extension of basic education from grades 1\u2013\n5  to  grades  1\u20138  in  the  selected  districts.  Furthermore,  stakeholders\u2019  capacity-development \nrequirements  at  all  levels  are  to  be  identified,  and  capacity  development  initiated.  The \ntransitional  plan  between  2010  and  2015  focuses  on  gradually  introducing  SSR  in  key  reform \nareas. Among other things, the restructured grade 1\u20138 basic education system will be gradually \nexpanded  within  an  overall  grade  1\u201312  framework  regularized  under  a  single  Education  Act. \nFurthermore,  shared  responsibility  among  governments,  parents,  and  SMCs  to  provide  and \nensure quality education will be established and enforced by a national policy on accountability. \n \n45. \nFurther in-depth analysis of the legal, institutional, technical, and financial implications of \nthe suggested policy and strategic options, including a cost-effectiveness analysis, will need to \nbe undertaken. This will help in further refining the rationale of the preferred options and in the \nplanning of the phased reform and restructuring process.  \n \n46. \nADB  Assistance  for  the  Core  Document  Preparation.  The  capacity-development \ngrant associated with ESP subprogram I supports the core document thematic group works, the \nconsultation  workshops,  teacher  workshops,  school  and  teacher  mapping,  and  the  capacity \ndevelopment of MOES policy functions. ESP subprogram II will focus on supporting the model-\nbuilding exercise and broader capacity development for system readiness. In-depth analysis of \npolicy options will be supported partly by the capacity-development grant and partly by technical \n\n \n\n\fassistance  for  the  preparation  of  ESP  subprogram  III,8  in  close  harmonization  with  technical \nassistance from other education development partners.     \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM II \n\n \nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n47. \nThe expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including the ESP subprogram \nII,  is  enhanced  educational  attainment  and  livelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and \ndisadvantaged groups. The expected outcome of ESP subprogram II is a broadly accepted and \nadequately  financed  SSR  policy,  program,  and  financing  framework.  A  program  policy  matrix \nand a development policy letter for ESP subprogram II are in Appendix 3.  \n \nB. \n \n48. \nThe  expected  outputs of  the  ESP subprogram  II  are  (i)  a revised  SSR  core  document, \nwith an analysis of preferred policy options, and a program and financing framework; and (ii) the \ncapacity  of  stakeholders  developed  at  various  levels  throughout  the  country  to  support  school \nsector  reform.  It  is  expected  that  lessons  learned  and  experiences  gained  from  the \nimplementation  of  the  grade  1\u20138  basic  education  system  in  the  model-building  districts  and \nschools will be adequately reflected in the SSR core document. \n \n49. \nActivities under the transitional plan between 2007 and 2010 include the preparation of \nguidelines and procedures, a model-building exercise and the initiation of capacity development \nfor SSR readiness. The SSR transitional activities will complement and extend the scope of the \nongoing  EFA.  Especially,  it  will  prepare  for  a  smooth  transition  from  the  current  subsector \napproach to the integrated 1\u201312 school sector approach. As such, it will follow the National Plan \nof Action for EFA 2015,9 which sets a long-term vision to extend basic education to grade 8 and \nto develop a holistic 1\u201312 school system. \n \n50.  Within  the  overall  EFA  vision  and  objectives,  ESP  subprogram  II  will  support  the \ntransitional  plan  (2007\u20132010)  between  2008  and  2011  jointly  with  all  other  EFA  development \npartners, particularly the model-building exercise and transition to grade 1\u20138 basic education in \nthe selected districts. With the contribution of the European Commission as a new development \npartner, the ESP subprogram II will also support capacity development to strengthen the school \nsystem\u2019s readiness to embark on the SSR. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Model-Building Exercise  \n\n \n\n51.  \nThe  model  building  will  specifically  focus  on  identifying  locally  relevant  and  effective \nways  of  making  the  transition  to  (i)  a  grade  1\u20138  structure  through  surveys,  planning,  and \nconsultation  with  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  integrated  functions  for  school-based  management, \nfinancing,  and  quality  improvement.  Rasuwa  district  from  the  mountains,  Dadeldhura  district \nfrom  the  hills,  and  Kapilvastu  district  from  the  Terai  have  been  selected  as  model-building \ndistricts.  The  model-building  districts  were  selected  based  on  ethnic  composition,  geographic \ndiversity,  and  preparedness  to  embark  on  advanced  implementation  of  the  grade  1\u20138  reform. \nDistrict implementation teams have been formed to conduct self-assessment, identify areas for \n\n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2007.

National Plan of Action for EFA 2015. Kathmandu.    \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n \n\nmodel  building  for  SSR,  and  to  implement  and  monitor  activities  under  MOES  guidance  and \nDOE administration.        \n \n52. \nIt will not be feasible to restructure and expand all of the existing schools to grade 1\u20138 in \none  attempt  as  some  schools  may  need  upgrading,  some  may  need  to  be  downsized,  and \nothers may need to be merged. A transitional plan for smooth integration will require a demand \nanalysis with adequate consideration of the needs and readiness of the community. The model-\nbuilding  exercise  will  implement  visioning  and  consultative  processes  in  the  model-building \ndistricts to gather community reflections on the integrated system. It will assess the demand and \nimplications  of  expanding  primary  level  to  grade  8.  Several  models  of  school  structure  will  be \ntested,  such  as  grades  1\u20133,  grades  1\u20135,  and  grades  1\u20138.  In  communities  with  smaller \npopulations,  multigrade  teaching  schools  will  be  considered.  The  model-building  exercise  will \nalso improve enabling conditions for grade 1\u20138 basic education schools through facility upgrade \nto accommodate grades 6\u20138, together with the provision of teaching learning materials.   \n \n53. \nTeacher  management\u2014such  as  employment,  deployment,  transfer,  and  teacher \ndevelopment\u2014remains  the  most  critical  and  complex  aspect  of  education  in  Nepal.  An  acute \nshortage of teachers in some districts and surplus in others is recognized. The model building \nwill support the provision of temporary teacher grants to address the short supply of teachers in \nschools  in  the  model-building  districts.  The  model  building  will  assess  the  gaps  and \nopportunities  in  current  teacher  management  and  will  develop  a  plan  for  efficient  teacher \nmanagement in an integrated school system. The following key areas of teacher management \nwill be explored during the model building: (i) teacher qualification, training, and deployment; (ii) \nthe role of the teacher service commission, district education offices, and SMCs; and (iii) other \nservice conditions that are pertinent to an integrated school system. \n \n54. \nSIPs  are  the  most  commonly  used  planning  tool  at  the  school  and  community  level. \nHowever,  for  SIPs  to  be  a  more  effective  tool  for  school  improvement  they  must  be \ncomplemented  by  efforts  to  develop  capacity  at  the  community  level  in  planning  and \nmanagement  for  school  improvement.  In  order  to  embark  upon  SSR,  it  is  imperative  that \nplanning tools and strategies are relevant and that stakeholders are competent enough to use \nthem. Model building will work on refining existing planning tools and processes. It will develop \ncapacity at the local level to ensure that the planning process is participatory, reflects the needs \nof disadvantaged groups, and that it will also be a part of the district and national-level planning \nand  budgeting  process.  It  will  seek  a  better  correlation  between  planning  tools  and  resource \nallocation, enabling the school and community to achieve quality improvement targets. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Development \n\nCapacity development is an essential feature of the SSR process. Capacity development \n\n55. \nunder SSR is distinguished at three levels (Figure 2): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlocal  government  agencies \n\nThe  SSR  preparation  supported  under  the  ESP  subprogram  II  is  a  capacity-\ndevelopment  exercise  designed  to  enhance  the  capacity  and  understanding  of \nthe \ncentral  and \ncountrywide  restructuring  and  reform  of  the  school  system.  It  includes  thematic \nworks,  broad  stakeholder  consultations,  a  model-building  exercise  in  selected \ndistricts,  and  use  of  a  single  streamlined  policy  coordination,  review,  and \napproval mechanism of the SSR. \nThe  SSR  implementation  itself  aims  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the \neducation system to better deliver the intended educational outcomes. \n\nto  prepare  and \n\nimplement \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\nIn  the  process,  capacity  of  the  different  organizations  involved  in  the  school \nsector at all levels (central, subnational, and school level) should be strengthened \nso  that  these  organizations  will  be  able  to  perform  their  responsibilities \nadequately.  These  organizational  capacity-development  activities  will  contribute \nto better SSR preparation and implementation through increased capacity of the \norganizations involved.  \n\nFigure 2: Capacity Development\n\nFY2008  FY2009  FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 \n\nSSR preparation \n\nSSR implementation\n\nOngoing organizational capacity development\n\nSSR = school sector reform. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n56.  MOES is developing a broad capacity-development plan as part of the transitional plan. \nWhile  support  for  capacity  development  for  overall  system  preparedness  is  embedded  in  the \nESP  cluster,  the  MOES  capacity-development  plan  will  focus  on  organizational  capacity \ndevelopment at the central, subnational, local, and school levels. Capacity-development needs \nand activities will be refined, along with revision of the SSR core document and the transitional \nplan.  The  capacity-development  plan  will  also  define  the  implementation  and  monitoring \nmechanism at each organizational level. \n    \nThe  ESP  subprogram  II  will  develop  the  capacity  of  policy-making  bodies  within  local \n57. \ngovernments  and  SMCs  at  the  school  level  to  set  appropriate  policies  that  apply  within  their \njurisdiction and that are consistent with central policies and guidelines. Local governments will \nreceive  orientation  and  training  on  national  educational  policy  and  their  role  in  educational \ngovernance.   \n \n58. \nThe  capacity  of  local  governments  to  implement  programs  and  policies  will  also  be \nstrengthened.  Systems  for  planning,  monitoring,  and  administration  of  schools  and  alternative \neducation providers will be optimized to support SSR goals and strategic objectives. To support \nlocal  planning  and  monitoring,  documentation  and  research  centers  will  be  created  within \nindividual agencies of the local government.  \n \nIn  technical  areas,  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  developing  capacity  for  different \n59. \nfunctions, such as curriculum development, assessment, student evaluation, continuous teacher \nsupport  and  development,  standard  setting,  and  accreditation.  To  enhance  management \ncapacity, activities will focus on (i) strengthening the education management information system \ndatabase; (ii) establishing systems for performance audits and social audits; and (iii) preparing \nplanning tools such as ASIPs, DEPs, and SIPs.      \n \n60. \nSchools are the central point for educational service delivery. They will be developed to \nenable  them  to  act  as  self-governing  independent  entities,  and  individual  schools  will  be \nprovided  with  technical  support  to  develop  capacity  for  self-management  and  governance. \nCritical  areas  of  capacity  development  envisaged  at  the  school  level  include  (i)  teacher \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nmobilization; (ii) teacher, curriculum, and leadership development; (iii) resource mobilization; (iv) \nreporting  and  communication  with  parents;  (v)  instructional  planning;  (vi)  collaboration  and \nnetworking; (vii) action research; and (viii) social auditing. Major focus for capacity-development \nactivities will be given to low-performing schools and those in disadvantaged areas.  \n \nC. \n  \n61. \nCosts of the early implementation of the SSR in the three model-building districts, as well \nas  overall  capacity  development,  are  estimated  at  approximately  $16  million.  These  include  (i) \ncosts  associated  with  the  development  of  new  learning  materials,  (ii)  additional  teacher  salaries \nand training, (iii) improvement of the school environment, (iv) enhancement of quality and social \ninclusion,  (v)  additional  SIP  grants  and  scholarships,  (vi)  capacity-development  activities  for \noverall system preparedness, and (vii) monitoring of management and administrative costs. The \nrecurrent costs for operating the school system during the transition phase, which include regular \nteacher  salaries  in  the  concerned  districts  and  salary  of  staff  at  the  central  and  district  level \ninvolved in the SSR transitional plan, have not been incorporated into this cost estimate as they \nwill be borne by the Government. \n \n62. \nThe Government has requested a program grant of $8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to contribute to the SSR transitional plan. In parallel with the ADB grant, as part of the \nEuropean Commission contribution to the school sector, the European Commission will provide a \nprogram grant of \u20ac6 million to support organizational capacity-development activities, both within \nkey  sector  institutions  in  the  country  and  with  major  stakeholders  and  communities.  All  EFA \ndevelopment partners have agreed to jointly finance the Program within the existing EFA JFA.  \n \nD. \n \n63. \nProgram  Management.  MOES  is  the  Executing  Agency  and  DOE  is  the  Implementing \nAgency.  A  central-level  coordination  committee  has  been  established  at  MOES  to  effectively \ncoordinate and monitor SSR capacity-development activities implemented by various MOES line \nagencies,  and  report  to  EPC  on  SSR  policy  implementation  initiatives.  The  central-level \ncoordination  committee  is  chaired  by  the  joint  secretary  of  the  MOES  Planning  Division  and \ncomprises  representatives  from  MOES,  DOE,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  National \nPlanning  Commission  and  other  education  line  agencies.  Similarly,  a  regional  implementation \nteam in each region and a district implementation team in the three model-building districts will be \nestablished.  The  technical  secretariat  at  MOES  will  provide  technical  support  to  model-building \ndistricts. The interministerial EPC, chaired by the Minister of Education and Sports, will approve \nSSR  policy  options  and  the  core  document  based  on  the  inputs  provided  by  the  central-level \ncoordination committee.  \n \nImplementation Period. The ESP subprogram II will be implemented over 4 years from \n64. \nJanuary  2008  to  December  2011.  It  is  expected  that  program  completion  will  be  in  December \n2011 and the grant closing date will be June 2012. \n \nTranching  and  Monitoring. The  grant  will  be  released in  a single tranche. The  tranche \n65. \nwill be released to the foreign exchange account (FEA) held by MOES at the Nepal Rastra Bank, \nand established under the EFA\u2019s JFA upon fulfilling all tranche release conditions. Funds will be \nreleased  from  the  FEA  to  the  government  consolidated  fund  based  on  submission  of  actual \nexpenditures by MOES and approval by MOF.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\nThe SSR transitional plan and its detailed activities under ESP subprogram II will be jointly \n66. \nappraised by the Government and all development partners. This transitional plan will incorporate \n(i) activities of model-building districts transforming into a grade 1\u20138 basic education system, and \n(ii) activities for capacity development for the school sector as a whole. Activities with costs, which \naddress both immediate priorities as well as preparing for longer-term reforms, will be provided for \neach  year.  Concrete  and  measurable  indicators  will  be  included.  Monitoring  of  progress  on  the \ntransitional plan will be integrated into the ongoing ASIP and AWPB. \n \nDisbursement,  Procurement,  and  Recruitment.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be \n67. \ndisbursed to MOF as the recipient in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.10 The grant proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 4) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation \nwill be required if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  grant \nproceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  Procurement  of  eligible \nitems and recruitment of consultants will be on the basis of standard Government procurement \nand  recruitment  practices  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  and  recruitment  by  the \nGovernment or its representatives. \n \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \n68. \nprogram  grant  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to  supplement  the  cost  associated  with \nimplementation of the SSR transitional plan. \n \nFund Flow Mechanism. The EFA\u2019s JFA will be amended to incorporate SSR transitional \n69. \nactivities under ESP subprogram II. The amended JFA will provide details of (i) the responsibilities \nof  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  of  participating  development  partners;  (ii)  the  funding \nmechanism;  (iii)  fiduciary  requirements,  including  procurement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and \nauditing;  and  (iv)  other  administrative  requirements.  An  additional  budget  head  account  to  the \nexisting 10 EFA budget head accounts will be opened within the EFA JFA to channel funds for the \nSSR transitional activities. Reporting and monitoring of progress on SSR transitional activities will \nbe  fully  integrated  into  the  ongoing  ASIP  and  AWPB.  MOES  will  provide  an  annual  draft \nprocurement  plan  to  the  development  partners  for  their  review,  and  procurement  monitoring \nreports  will  be  provided  in  each  trimester  during  program  period.  Procurement  of  works,  goods, \nand services for the Program will follow procedures and regulations specified in the Government\u2019s \nProcurement Act 2007 and the Procurement Regulations 2007.  \n \n70. \nThe responsibility for implementing the program will rest with MOES and DOE. MOES will \nuse  the  Government\u2019s  reporting  system  to  submit  the  FMR  to  the  pooled  development  partners \neach trimester. Replenishment of the funds from the FEA will be based on the timely and accurate \nsubmission  of  the  FMR.  The  ESP  subprogram  II  will  be  audited  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor \nGeneral of Nepal in accordance with auditing standards. The audited statements will be provided \nto the partners within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1998.

Firstly,  grant  proceeds  will  be \n71. \ndeposited  in  the  FEA  held  by  MOES  in  accordance  with  the  respective  provisions  of  grant \nagreements between the Government and the respective pooled development partners. While the \nfunds will be pooled, each pooling partners\u2019 accounts will be recorded, reconciled, and reflected \nseparately in the FMR. Under Government procedures, no direct payments can be made from the \nFEA.  Secondly,  funds  will  be  transferred  from  the  FEA  to  the  Government\u2019s  consolidated  fund \nbased  on submission of  actual  expenditures by  MOES  and  approval by  MOF. However,  MOES \nwill transfer the funds from the FEA to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund only upon receipt of \nthe approval of FMR from the pooled development partners.  \n \nE. \n \nNepal\u2019s  ongoing  political  transition  may  delay  some  aspects  of  the  reform  process. \n72. \nStrategies  related  to  some  areas  of  education  governance,  financing,  and  structure  may  be \ndecided at a later stage. However, the model-building exercise, capacity-development activities \nand  further  preparation  in  key  education  reform  areas  of  quality  improvement  and  assurance, \nand social inclusion, do not require the political transition to be finalized, and hence will not be \naffected. Anticorruption measures under ESP subprogram II will follow the provisions under the \nEFA\u2019s  JFA.  In  particular,  EFA  partners  endorsed  a  financial  management  improvement  action \nplan prepared by DOE. The EFA midterm review concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and \nreporting  procedures  under  the  JFA  comply  with  fiduciary  requirements  in  an  acceptable \nmanner. DOE is undertaking measures to (i) improve financial management pertinent to timely \ndisbursement  to  districts  and  schools  and  submission  of  the  FMR,  (ii)  simplify  and  clarify \nguidelines,  and  (iii)  strengthen  monitoring  and  coordination  mechanisms  at  all  levels.  DOE\u2019s \naction  plan  for  financial  management  improvement  also  comprises  capacity  development  in \nsocial auditing and school auditing. Both ESP subprograms I and II have provisions to support \nsuch capacity development.    \n  \nF. \n    \n73. \nESP subprogram II will have a positive impact on the socially disadvantaged groups, as \nsocial  inclusion  is  a  key  theme  of  the  draft  core  document.  The  vulnerable  communities \ndevelopment  framework  developed  under  ESP  subprogram  I  will  remain  relevant  under  ESP \nsubprogram II. Civil works will consist of additional classrooms to accommodate grades 6\u20138 in \nbasic  education  schools  in  the  model-building  districts.  Approximately  200  classrooms  will  be \nconstructed.  The  Government  has  undertaken  an  initial  survey  of  land  requirements  to \nimplement  the  model-building  exercise  and  has  concluded  that  no  land  acquisition  will  take \nplace under the Program. No significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated in this \nProgram.  \n \n\nCompliance with Social Safeguard Policies \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n74. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the draft Grant Agreement: \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n(i) \n\nMOES and DOE will implement, manage, coordinate and monitor the Program in \nfiduciary \nresponsibilities, \naccordance  with \nrequirements,  and  other  program  management  arrangements  as  set  out  in  the \ndraft SSR core document and agreed in the EFA JFA; \n\nfunding  mechanism, \n\nits  goals, \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\n \nB. \n \n75. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMOES will implement and manage the Program in accordance with the vulnerable \ncommunities development framework agreed upon between MOES and ADB;  \n\nNo  activities  under  the  Program  will  entail  land  acquisition  or  other  resettlement \nactivities under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995);  \n\nThroughout the program period, the budget share for education will remain at least \nat  the  level  of  FY2008,  while  all  efforts  will  be  made  to  increase  the  budget \nallocation; and  \n\nMOES will ensure compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations of \nNepal, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness  \n\nThe following are conditions for grant effectiveness:  \n\nthe Government will have issued an executive order enabling MOES to restructure, \non a pilot basis, 1\u20138 basic education in Rasuwa District, Dadeldhura District, and \nKapilvastu District;    \n\nall policy actions set forth in the policy matrix will have been complied with; and  \n\nthe amendments to the EFA JFA, required to use such EFA JFA for financing any \nSSR-related activities, shall have become effective.    \n\nVIII.
