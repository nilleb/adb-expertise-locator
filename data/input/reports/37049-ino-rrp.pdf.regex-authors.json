An initial \nAssessment  environmental  examination  was  undertaken.  A  strategic  environmental \nassessment has been prepared for the Citarum River basin.  \n   \nInvestment  The  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources  Management  Investment \nProgram  Program will fund a range of interventions across the water sector that \nDescription  relate to water and land management that are necessary to pursue the \nintroduction  of  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  in  the \nCitarum River basin. The selection of interventions for funding under the \nInvestment  Program  was  made  based  on  a  road  map,  or  strategic \ninvestment plan, for basin-wide IWRM. The road map sets out the agreed \ninterventions  until  2023  that  will  be  required  to  achieve  key  IWRM \nobjectives. The initial estimate of the cost of the full suite of interventions is \n$3.5  billion.  The  component  subprojects  selected  for  inclusion  in  the \nInvestment Program all come from the road map and were prioritized by \nbasin stakeholders in a participatory planning process with selection criteria \nthat included (i) the importance and urgency of the intervention, (ii) the \npotential  contribution  to  implementing  IWRM,  and  (iii)  whether  the \nintervention  was  likely  to  be  funded  by  other  funding  agencies  or  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  (the  Government)  itself,  wherever  possible \nminimizing the number of implementing agencies and concentrating on \nsectors in which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can add value or has \ntraditionally  partnered  with  the  Government.  The  planned  component \nprojects  (outputs)  are  grouped  by  key  IWRM  areas  as  follows:  (i) \ninstitutions and planning for IWRM; (ii) water resource development and \nmanagement; (iii) water sharing; (iv) environmental protection; (v) disaster \nmanagement; (vi) community empowerment; (vii) data, information, and \ndecision support; and (viii) program management. \n \nRationale  The Citarum River basin is in the province of West Java and covers 13,000 \nsquare  kilometers  (km2).  The  Government  considers  it  to  be  the  most \nstrategic river basin in the country because it provides 80% of the surface \nwater supply to the capital city of Jakarta. The water is carried to Jakarta \nand its metropolitan conurbation through the West Tarum Canal, which was \nconstructed in 1966 and urgently needs rehabilitation and upgrading. The \nCitarum River basin supports a population of more than 28 million people \nand 20% of the country\u2019s industrial output. The upper basin has three \nhydroelectric dams producing a total of 1,400 megawatts. The river feeds ", "ii   \nirrigation schemes covering close to 400,000 hectares (ha) that produce \n5% of the country\u2019s rice.  \n \nSustainable  management  of  the  basin\u2019s  river  and  groundwater  are \ntherefore critical to the social and economic development of the country. \nThe basin\u2019s water resources have come under increased pressure over the \npast  20  years  from  urbanization  and  industrial  growth,  causing  severe \nwater pollution and acute stress and depletion of groundwater in several \nlocations.  Rapid  urbanization  has significantly  increased vulnerability  to \nfloods,  and  there  are  early  indications  that  climate  change  is  already \ndramatically  increasing  the  intensity  of  flood  events.  Environmental \ndegradation  has  reached  levels  that  compromise  public  health  and \nlivelihoods, particularly for the poor, and incurs additional economic and \nfinancial costs in the delivery of clean, reliable bulk water supplies. \n \nFor these reasons, the Government has determined to adopt a concerted \napproach to improving land and water management in the basin. It has \nrequested  ADB\u2019s  help  in  developing  and  funding  this  long-term  IWRM \nInvestment Program guided by, and part of, a strategic road map. With \nADB\u2019s  help,  the  Government  and  stakeholders  in  the  basin  have \nformulated  a  shared  vision:  the  Government  and  communities  working \ntogether for clean, healthy, and productive catchments and rivers, bringing \nsustainable benefits to all people of the Citarum River basin. \n   \nImpact and  The expected impact of the Investment Program is reduced poverty and \nOutcome  improved  health  and  living  standards  in  the  Citarum  River  basin.  The \nexpected outcome is improved and integrated water resource management \nin the Citarum River basin. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated total cost of implementing the projects of the road map is \n$3.5 billion over 15 years, of which the proposed Investment Program \naccounts for $921 million.  \n   \nMultitranche  The Government has requested $503.8 million in loans from ADB and a \nFinancing  Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant administered by ADB to support \nFacility  the  Investment  Program.  This  is  to  be  structured  as  a  multitranche \n  financing facility (MFF) with a lifespan of 10 years. The MFF will finance \nprojects  under  the  Investment  Program,  provided  that  the  Government \ncomplies with assurances to ADB and the constituent projects are in line \nwith those assurances and the criteria set out in the framework financing \nagreement (FFA). \n \nADB will provide loans to finance projects under the MFF upon submission \nof satisfactory periodic financing requests (PFRs). Except for Project 1\u2014for \nwhich the PFR is for two loans from ADB (one from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources [OCR] and the other from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources) and a\nGEF grant administered by ADB\u2014each loan will constitute a tranche and \nmay carry financing terms different from those of previous or later loans. \n \nThe choice of terms will depend on the project and ADB\u2019s financing policies \nat the time the loan is legally documented.  Tranches  may  be  provided  in \n ", "  iii\n  sequence or simultaneously and may overlap; four indicative tranches have \nbeen designed. \n \nThe projects corresponding to individual tranches may comprise physical \nand other components of the Investment Program that are packaged based \non procurement and/or implementation years. The minimum amount of \neach PFR will be $10 million equivalent.  \n   \nInvestment  Financing Plan for the Investment Program  \nProgram  ($ million)  \nFinancing Plan  Share \nSource  Total  % \nADB ADF Loan  30.0  3.3 \nADB OCR Loan  470.0  51.0 \nGovernment of Indonesia  381.6  41.4 \nADB (TA )  4.0  0.4 \nParallel Funding (TA)   4.0  0.4 \nGovernment of the Netherlands (TA)  5.0  0.5 \nMultidonor Trust Fund under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility (TA)  2.0  0.2 \nBeneficiaries  21.0  2.3 \nGlobal Environment Facility (ADB \nadministered)  3.8  0.4 \nTotal  921.4  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development \nFund, OCR = ordinary capital resources, TA = technical \nassistance.  \n  Sources: Government of Indonesia and ADB estimates. \n   \nFramework  The  Government  has  entered  into an  FFA  with  ADB  that  satisfies  the \nFinancing  requirements of the policy to mainstream the MFF. Pursuant to the FFA, \nAgreement  the Government has submitted the first PFR for $53.8 million equivalent to \n  ADB. The first PFR is presented to the Board for information together with \nthe FFA. Before ADB\u2019s acceptance of a PFR, ADB will ensure that the \nGovernment complies in full with the terms and conditions of the FFA.  \n   \nMFF Amount  The maximum financing amount under the MFF is $503.8 million, with up to \nand Terms  $470 million to be provided from ADB\u2019s OCR, up to $30 million to be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and $3.8 million to be a \nGEF grant administered by ADB. The Government will convert the MFF \ninto several loans or project tranches. Final terms and conditions will be \ndetermined  for  each  individual  loan  based  on  prevailing  ADB  policies. \nFinancing OCR resources will be subject to interest to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility and such other terms and conditions set forth in the related \nloan agreements. \n \n ", "iv   \nPeriod of   A 10-year availability period is proposed for the MFF, from 2009 to 2018, \nUtilization  with the last loan agreement to be executed no later than 31 December \n  2018. The period of utilization will thus be 15 years from 1 January 2009 to \n31 December 2023. Each loan will have its own closing date to match with \nits implementation period. \n \nEstimated  31 December 2023. \nProgram \nCompletion \nDate \n   \nExecuting  Directorate General Water Resources (DGWR) of the Ministry of Public \nAgency  Works. \n   \nImplementation  A  road  map  coordination  and  management  unit  (RCMU)  has  been \nArrangements  established in the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) to \nensure overall planning and financial management in the national and local \ngovernments.  DGWR  has  established  a  project  coordination  and \nmanagement unit (PCMU) in its Citarum River basin organization, Balai \nBesar  Wilayah  Sungai  Citarum,  which  is  responsible  for  the  overall \nmanagement and coordination of all investment program activities. The \nRCMU  and  the  PCMU  will  work  closely  with  the  National  Steering \nCommittee for Water Resources. Project implementation units (PIUs) will \nbe  established  in  each  implementing  agency.  Routine  communications \nfrom ADB on the Investment Program will be addressed to the PCMU.  \n   \nProcurement  All goods, civil works, and related services financed under the MFF will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting  An estimated 301 person-months of international consultancy and 2,004 \nServices  person-months  of  national  consultancy  will  be  required  to  assist  the \nGovernment,  local  governments,  and  communities  in  implementing \nProject 1. Consultants will be engaged to support the management and \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n   \nProject Benefits  The beneficiaries of the Investment Program will be the inhabitants of the \nand  Citarum River basin, as well as Jabodetabek residential, agricultural, and \nBeneficiaries  industrial users supplied with water from the basin via the West Tarum \nCanal. In particular, the Investment Program has been designed to address \nthe needs of a broad range of basin stakeholders and help communities to \nplan and undertake their own water- and land-management measures. \n \n ", "  v\nRisks and  The  success  of  the  Investment  Program  hinges  on  several  factors.  A \nAssumptions  detailed account of the risks is given in the main body of the report. Key \nareas of concern are as follows:  \n \nInteragency  Commitment.  The  Government  adopted  in  2004  a \ncomprehensive water law that promotes IWRM in river basins. The road \nmap  sets  out  the  concerted  implementation  of  a  well-planned  and \ncoordinated cross-sectoral set of interventions to introduce IWRM in the \nbasin. Interagency commitment to the Investment Program is essential to \nachieve the desired results. The MFF ensures the long-term engagement \nby ADB with a holistic approach to support the phased introduction of \nIWRM. \n \n  Stakeholder  Participation.  Key  project  outcomes  include  stakeholder \nparticipation  overseen  by  the  proposed  river  basin  Water  Council.  To \nensure  effective  stakeholder  participation,  the  Investment  Program  will \nsupport  (i)  a  community-driven  approach  to  project  design  and \nimplementation, (ii) intensive media campaigns and community and private \nsector  awareness  programs,  (iii)  private  sector  involvement  in  IWRM \nthrough  corporate  social  responsibility  programs,  and  (iv)  support  to \ngovernance  initiatives.  Institutional  support  through  parallel  technical \nassistance (TA) funding will support these activities.  \n \n \nRoad map Allocations and MFF Utilization. The risk exists that the road \nmap will not be adequately funded and that program funds will not be fully \nor  effectively  utilized.  The  Investment  Program  establishes  not  only \nprogram coordination and management but the RCMU in BAPPENAS. To \nsupport the road map, the RCMU will be responsible for ensuring the well-\ncoordinated, holistic, and integrated scheduling of investment projects by \nnational, provincial, and district governments and private and community \nstakeholders. \n   \nTechnical  During the preparation of the road map, the Government requested ADB to \nAssistance   provide TA for Institutional Strengthening for IWRM in the 6 Cis River Basin \nTerritory.  ADB,  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility, and the Government of the Netherlands have agreed \nto provide TA support to the 6 Cis River Basin Territory to (i) strengthen the \ninstitutional arrangements for improved water resource management in the \nregion; (ii) build the capacity and expertise of agencies involved in water \nresource management; and (iii) promote a more integrated approach to \nriver basin planning.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF), and (ii) a proposed administration of grant to be provided \nby the Global Environment Facility (GEF)1, both to the Republic of Indonesia for the Integrated \nCitarum Water Resource Management Investment Program (the Investment Program), and (iii) \na  proposed  administration  of  a  portion  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional \nStrengthening for Integrated Water Resources Management in the 6 Cis River Basin Territory to \nbe provided by the Government of the Netherlands and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater Financing Partnership Facility. If the Board approves the proposed multitranche financing \nfacility and administration of the GEF grant and the technical assistance grant, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB providing the balance for the said \nTA. The design and monitoring framework for the Investment Program is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Natural resources have been the backbone of economic growth in Indonesia and will be \nheavily relied upon in the medium term. Forestry, agriculture, coastal and marine, and mining \ncontribute about one-fourth of the gross domestic product (GDP), and the sector still employs \nthe largest segment of Indonesia\u2019s population and the poor. The country is rich in natural \nresources,  but  they  are  under  immense  pressure.  Underinvestment  in  water  resource \ndevelopment and management impedes economic growth and the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Java Island is home to 60% of the population but constitutes only \nabout 7% of the land area. Nationwide, though the average water demand is only about 1.7% of \ntotal runoff, it is heavily concentrated on Java, where annual runoff utilization in some critical \nrivers approaches 50%. National policy takes a holistic approach to the integrated management \nof water resources for their sustainable use. The following specific constraints in the water \nresources  sector  highlight  current  performance  weaknesses  and  are  addressed  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term development plan:2 (i) the degradation of river basin areas; (ii) \nweak water sector coordination, institutions, and administration at the national, river basin, \ndistrict, and community level; (iii) weak rare-event flood and drought management; (iv) spatial \nand time imbalances between water supply and demand; (v) worsening conflict between water \nsubsector services; (vi) poor utilization of irrigation infrastructure; (vii) inequitable community \nwater access and poor hygiene; and (viii) low-quality data management, information systems, \nand research and development.    \n \n3.  The CRB is mainly in the province of West Java and covers 13,000 square kilometers \n(km2) lying immediately to the east of the Jabodetabek conurbation.3 The CRB is the most \nstrategic river basin in the country, with a population of 27,864,000 people in 2004, which is \nmore than 72% of the provincial total and is growing by more than 3% annually. There are three \nhydroelectric  dams  in  the  upper  section  of  the  basin  producing  an  aggregate  of  1,400 \nmegawatts. The area of irrigated agricultural land is 240,000 hectares (ha) in the Jatiluhur \nirrigation system  of  the  lower  basin  and  a  further  150,000  ha  in small  and  medium-sized \n                                                 \n1  GEF provided concept clearance for a $3.8 million grant subject to final chief executive officer\u2019s endorsement. In \nthe event that GEF financing does not materialize, either the Government will arrange for alternative funding or the \nGovernment and ADB will make appropriate reductions in the scope of Project 1. \n2  Presidential Regulation 7/2005 on the national medium-term development plan was issued on 19 January 2005. \n3  The metropolitan conurbation includes the cities of Jakarta, Depok, Bogor, Tangaran, and Bekasi and has a \ncombined population of 18 million. ", "2   \nirrigation schemes in the upland areas. Irrigated agriculture yields about 3 million tons of rice \nannually, or about 5% of the national production. The CRB supplies 80% of the raw surface \nwater supply to the capital city of Jakarta, as well as Bandung\u2019s ground and surface water.4 \nWater from the basin\u2019s rivers and groundwater systems is essential to the social and economic \ndevelopment of the country, as well as for urban and industrial development, including export \nindustry, agricultural production, rural water supply, electricity generation though hydropower, \nand fisheries. The basin area itself contributes about 4% of national GDP,5 but if the water from \nthe basin used in Jakarta is taken into account that figure increases to more than 20%. \n \n4.  The water resources of the basin are limited, providing on average 1,300 cubic meters \n(m3) per person per year.6 Competition for these resources has increased significantly over the \npast 20 years, causing acute water stress and depletion of aquifers in some places. Jakarta and \nBandung routinely encounter shortfalls in raw water supplies, and the overuse of groundwater \nhas  mined  aquifers  in  both  cities,  causing  alarming  rates  of  irreversible  land  subsidence. \nIrrigated cropping intensities in the lower basin remain significantly lower than their potential. \nSome 3.5 million basin inhabitants have inadequate water and sanitation facilities; the MDG \nTarget 107 on sanitation is unlikely to be met in the CRB. Rapid urbanization8 has significantly \nincreased exposure to flood risk and the generation of pollution. The highly polluted Citarum \nRiver is classified by the Ministry of Environment as Class V water quality, the lowest rating, as \nenvironmental degradation has reached a level that compromises public health and livelihoods, \nparticularly for the poor. Recent population pressures and radical land-use change over the last \n50 years leaves only scattered remnants of the unique West Java rainforests and West Java \nmontane ecosystems, which the World Wide Fund for Nature listed among the top 200 critical \nglobal ecosystems. Climate change adds to the stresses on ecosystems and water resource \nmanagement and poses escalating risks to the health, livelihood, and disaster vulnerability of \npoor communities in the basin. \n \n5.  A  management  focus  on  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  and  the \nsustainability of the water resources is emphasized in Indonesia\u2019s 2004 Water Law No. 7. The \nwater  law  introduces  the  concept  of  basin  management  and  reflects  the  principles  of \ndecentralization and devolvement of authority to localities, as promoted by the program of \nregional autonomy. Preparations for implementing IWRM are at a preliminary stage in the basin. \nIndependent Citarum River basin organizations exist under both national and regional funding \nwith development and management mandates that require close coordination and cooperation. \n(Appendix 2 provides a summary of the current institutional arrangements in the CRB.) Potential \nbenefits derived from effective IWRM are substantial, and it is recognized that water plays a key \nrole in achieving the MDGs in the country. Inadequate water development and management \nworsens poverty by limiting livelihood opportunities and worsening public health, vulnerability, \nand environmental degradation. Although not all benefits are measurable directly in economic \nterms, some indicators specific to the water sector are measurable and can be shown to be \nhighly correlated with measures of social factors such as poverty (Appendix 2).  \n \n                                                 \n4 Bandung, the capital of West Java Province, is Indonesia\u2019s fourth largest city. The greater Bandung regency and \nmetropolitan area has a population of 7 million and is the fastest growing urban region in Indonesia. \n5  Inferred from statistics provided by various statistical sources, including Statistics Indonesia, 2007. \n6  Less than 1,400 m3 per person per year is considered water short. \n7  MDG Target 10 states that the countries of the world pledge to reduce by half the proportion of people \nwithout access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by the year 2015. \n8  Some rural districts around Jakarta have populations that are 20% migrant arrivals within the past 5 years. \n ", "    3  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Issues \n6.  Water Resource Development and Management Issues. CRB national and regional \nwater  resources  institutions  operate  in  a  fast-developing  region  under  a  relatively  new \ndecentralized regime. Regulations and policies of the Directorate General of Water Resources \n(DGWR)  in  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  acknowledge  the  need  for  improved  institutional \ncapacity to implement IWRM in large river basins, including the CRB. The mandate of the \nCitarum  River  basin  organization  under  DGWR,  the  Balai  Besar  Wilayah  Sungai  Citarum \n(BBWSC) and institutional interactions with regional organizations are described in Appendix 2. \nDiagnostic assessments of the capacity of water resource organizations and other stakeholders \nin the CRB have been undertaken and capacity-building plans designed.  \n \n 7.  A detailed CRB sector analysis related to IWRM is in Appendix 2. While it is commonly \naccepted  that  the  surface  and  groundwater  resources  available  for  use  in  the  basin  are \nadequate to meet present demand, it is clear that some rapidly emerging issues are now \ncausing temporary shortfalls in supply,9 and certainly have the potential to cause significant and \npermanent water supply problems in the future.  \n \n8.  The first issue is that water delivery infrastructure\u2014in particular the extensive canal \nsystems in the lower basin; the East, North, and West Tarum Canals; and their associated \nsecondary  and  tertiary  networks\u2014have  become  degraded  in  recent  years  mainly  by  high \nsediment loads and inadequate maintenance. The West Tarum Canal (WTC)\u2014which takes \nwater from downstream of the reservoir system on the Citarum River to Bekasi, for subsequent \ndelivery of municipal water to much of Jakarta and, via off-takes along the way, to WTC \nirrigation areas totaling 56,000 ha\u2014suffers severe sedimentation and has a current carrying \ncapacity well below its original design. This situation is exacerbated by the illegal occupation of \nthe banks of the canal by settlers and the waste materials that are dumped into it. Similarly in \nthe  secondary  canal  system  supplied  by  the  WTC,  sedimentation  and  degradation  from \nneglected maintenance restrict the supply of irrigation to large areas of developed farmlands at \nthe far end of the system. This restricts irrigated production to well below the original design \ntargets.  \n \n9.  The second issue is rapid urbanization and industrialization, particularly in the eastern \nparts  of  the  Jakarta  conurbation  and  continuing  southeast  along  the  recently  completed \nmotorway  to  Bandung.  In  fact,  the  motorway  is  creating  a  development  corridor  that  will \ngradually expand east and south toward Bandung, which is undergoing significant expansion. \nThis urbanization and industrialization will significantly increase water demand and pollution \nloads in the rivers of the lower basin. These developments will intensify the stress on the limited \nwater resources, particularly around Bandung, which is in the upper basin and depends on \ngroundwater resources for 90% of supplies. The rate of water extraction from local aquifers \nalready significantly exceeds recharge rates, causing water tables to decline by more than 1 \nmeter per year in some places.  \n \n10.  Environmental Issues. A strategic environmental assessment has been prepared for \nthe CRB (Appendix 3). The numerous environmental issues in the CRB result predominantly but \nnot exclusively from the same urbanization and industrialization that is the cause of water \n                                                 \n9 In 2001, the system failed to meet water needs for 1.5 months during the dry season, and in 2005 it failed to meet \nwater needs for 5 months. \n ", "4   \nsupply shortages. Deforestation of the upper catchments cause increased sediment loads, flash \nfloods, landslides, and other water-related disasters. The potential effects of climate change \nhave yet to be quantified. \n \n11.  The combination of untreated domestic sewage, solid waste disposal, and industrial \neffluents has significantly increased pollution loads in the Citarum River system. In the upper \nbasin, river water polluted with domestic and industrial waste from Bandung flows into the \nSaguling Reservoir. Biological oxygen demand10 at the Saguling Reservoir inlet reaches as high \nas 130 milligrams per liter (mg/l) during the dry season. In recent years, biological oxygen \ndemand in the Cikapunding River\u2014a major tributary of the Saguling River, which flows through \nBandung\u2014was reported to reach as high as 100 mg/l. Inadequate sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement  are  problems  in  urban,  peri-urban,  and  rural  communities.  These  problems \ndegrade not only the environment but also community health and living standards. \n \n12.  Runoff from hillside farms contributes significant amounts of the nutrients nitrogen and \nphosphorus, which induce eutrophication in the reservoirs. At Saguling, where the problem is \nmost significant, nitrogen loading is estimated at over 33,000 tons per year, and phosphorus \nloading at 4,370 tons per year. Algal blooms and their subsequent decay regularly cause fish \nkills, inflicting considerable financial losses to fish farmers. Hydrologic flow regimes have been \nadversely changed by land degradation, notably the loss of adequate forest cover and the \nprevalence of hillside farming in upper catchments. The degraded catchments have reduced \ncapacity to capture rainwater, causing high peak flows during the rainy months that carry large \namounts of eroded soil. At the entrance to the Saguling Reservoir, the ratio of the volume of wet \nseason high flows to dry season low flows has increased from 3.4 in 1992 to 7.4 in 2003. As a \nresult, landslides and mud flows are frequent during the rainy season. An estimated 25% of the \nbasin now suffers erosion in excess of 60 tons per ha per year, or 3\u20134 millimeters of soil loss \nannually.  \n \n13.  The CRB is experiencing the shrinkage of natural ecosystem areas, notably forested \nareas. Recent West Java reports on the environmental state of the basin show ecological \ndiversity in the CRB, which has 160 plant species, 24 mammals (20 protected, 3 endemic, and 1 \nscarce),  72  birds  (60  protected,  10  endemic,  and  2  scarce),  11  protected  reptiles,  and  2 \nprotected fish. Land-use changes have left only scattered remnants of natural forest habitat. \nMuch of it is in the 240,402 ha of 11 protected forest areas, which are significant for the \nconservation of biodiversity because they are among the most intact areas of forest remaining \non Java. Most of the protected areas were relatively undisturbed when designated. However, in \nrecent times many have suffered serious degradation as a result of encroachment, the illegal \nremoval of non-timber forest products, fires, and illegal logging. All remaining patches of natural \nvegetation in the CRB, even if secondary, are of the highest conservation significance. \n \n14.  Social Issues. Government statistics11 place the number of poor people in the CRB at \n2,660,000, or 9.6% of the total estimated CRB population. District poverty figures vary from 4% \nin  richer  urban  areas  to  22%  in  rural  districts  in  the  upper  basin.  About  2,400,000  rural \nhouseholds and 840,000 urban households do not have toilet facilities, and 590,000 rural \nhouseholds and 260,000 urban households get their drinking water from unprotected springs, \nwells, or directly from rivers. Agriculture and natural resources, which this Investment Program \n                                                 \n10 This is a commonly used indicator of water quality. Most pristine rivers have a 5-day demand below 1 milligram per \nliter, moderately polluted rivers may have a value in the range of 2 to 8mg/l, and untreated sewage ranges from \n200 to 600mg/l. \n11 Consumption and expenditure data are collected through the national socioeconomic survey of 2004.  \n ", "    5  \n \nmainly  addresses,  remain  the  backbone  of  economic  development  in  Indonesia.  It  was \nestimated in 2002 that 45% of the labor force was employed in the sector, which provided more \nthan 40% of household income. Improvement in incomes and standards of living through the \ndevelopment of water resources and improved water resource management in the CRB will \nhave flow-on effects through the national economy. \n \n2.  Lessons  \n15.  ADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for Indonesia, completed in December \n2005,  identifies  some  of  the  salient  lessons  learned  from  recently  completed  and  current \nprojects in the water sector.12 The evaluation concluded that natural resource management \ninitiatives are more likely to succeed if they follow an integrated approach that addresses both \nenvironmental and socioeconomic concerns and are designed and implemented with the full \ninvolvement  of  communities  and  regional  governments.  It  further  concluded  that  long-term \npartnerships lend sustainability to reforms and initiatives and increase development impact. \nDespite attempts to improve the institutional framework for river basin and water resource \nmanagement in Indonesia, there appears to be general agreement that current institutional \narrangements remain highly sectoral, with limited effective coordination, and that, although \nregulatory frameworks and standards are generally in place (e.g., for water quality or licensing), \nenforcement is weak. Considering the organizational functions inherent in IWRM demonstrates \nthat institutional coordination remains a major issue to be addressed, as (i) the responsibilities \nof DGWR and provincial water resource services are limited to in-stream activities, (ii) the \ncurrent focus of provincial and basin coordination mechanisms also tends to concentrate on in-\nstream areas; and (iii) groundwater is the responsibility of provincial and district agencies for \nmineral resources, not the water resource agencies.  \n \n16.  In addition to the general sector lessons highlighted above and those further detailed in \nAppendix 2, the following specific lessons were emphasized by basin stakeholders during the \npreparation of the Investment Program: \n \n(i)  Communities should be empowered to participate in and influence key activities \nwith regard to planning, designing, and constructing facilities. \n(ii)  Community facilitators will be a key factor in ensuring successful implementation. \n(iii)  Hygiene behavioral change programs need to be emphasized to create healthy \nrivers and catchments. \n(iv)  Prioritize simple water and sanitation technology for community management. \n(v)  Balance the needs of upstream and downstream water users. \n(vi)  Expanding water-related livelihood activities should be an objective of the project. \n(vii)  All works must be sustainable. \n(viii)  Gender issues require specific and meaningful attention. \n(ix)  Government,  communities,  industry,  and  other  stakeholders  should  work \ntogether to achieve a shared vision for the CRB. \n \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n17.  Water has been a major area of ADB assistance to Indonesia. As of end-2007, ADB had \nprovided 103 loans for $4.17 billion and 151 technical assistance (TA) projects for $68.8 million \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005. Country Assistance Program Evaluation, Indonesia. Manila. IWRM is a subsector of the agriculture and \nnatural resources sector. The term \u201cwater\u201d in this report is used to cover the urban, rural, and basin water as \ndefined in ADB\u2019s Water for All policy. \n ", "6   \nin agriculture and rural development, including irrigation, livestock, fisheries, forestry, and rural \ndevelopment. Over the years, ADB has become increasingly selective in providing assistance to \nthe sector, focusing on its niche areas of experience and specialization. ADB\u2019s involvement in \nforestry and livestock has been almost completely phased out. Water resource management, \nflood management, irrigation development, and marine and costal resource management have \nemerged as subsectors for which ADB is a lead development partner of the Government. \n \n18.  The  role  of  ADB\u2019s  development  partners  is  significant,  with  the  following  actively \nsupporting the sector: the World Bank in water supply and sanitation, water resources and \nirrigation management, environment and biodiversity conservation, and agriculture and rural \ndevelopment; Japan Bank for International Cooperation in water resources, water supply and \nsanitation, irrigation management, and rural development; International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment in agriculture and rural development; Government of the Netherlands in water \nresources,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  irrigation  management;  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development in water supply and sanitation and agriculture and rural development; \nand  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  in  environment  and  biodiversity \nconservation. A summary of recent sector lending is in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Government Policy and Strategy for Water Resource Management \n19.  The basic principles underpinning Indonesia\u2019s approach to water resource development \nand management is succinctly summarized by Water Law No. 7/2004, which states that \u201cthe \nwater resources management framework is to be prepared based on the river basin area with \nintegration between surface water and ground water, carried out by extensive involvement of \nthe  community  and  business  world  and  based  on  the  principles  of  balance  between \nconservation efforts and utilization of water resources.\u201d \n \n20.  Government policies prioritize the (i) management of natural resources and conservation \nto benefit and improve the well-being of the people for future generations; (ii) conservation, \nrehabilitation, and economic use of natural resources and the environment, as well as the use of \nenvironment-friendly  technology;  (iii)  use  of  indicators  to  measure  efforts  to  conserve  and \nmanage renewable natural resources to avert irreversible degradation; (iv) gradual transfer to \nregional governments of the authority for the selective management of natural resources and \nthe preservation of the environment; and (v) use of natural resources to the greatest benefit and \nwelfare of the people. Strong Government ownership of project preparation and the design of \nthe Investment Program illustrate its desire to implement these policies and improve IWRM in \nthe CRB. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Policy and Strategies \n21.  ADB\u2019s Water for All13 policy encourages and promotes a national focus on water sector \nreform  and  IMWR  through  improved  and  expanded  water  services,  while  fostering  the \nconservation  of  water  and  increased  system  efficiencies.  The  policy  promotes  regional \ncooperation and the mutually beneficial use of shared water resources within and between \ncountries, the exchange of water sector information and experience, and improved governance. \nThe strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s water sector operations in Indonesia will, in the short and medium \nterm, focus on reviving growth in the rural economy and managing natural resources in a \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2001.

Road Map for Integrated Water Resources Management in the Citarum River Basin \n22.  With ADB-funded project preparatory TA,15 the Government has since 2005 gathered \nextensive inputs from numerous stakeholders. Forums and dialogue have been used to gather \nthe ideas, concerns, and vision of water users, water managers, and other actors throughout the \nCRB. Appendix 5 provides a CRB problem tree analysis, which summarizes key IWRM issues \nin the basin. The objective of different stakeholders\u2019 adopting a shared vision in the design of a \nroad map for IWRM in the CRB was agreed upon to facilitate a shift from a traditional single-\nproject planning approach to a holistic, integrated, and coordinated development approach with \nownership by basin stakeholders. Project preparatory TA helped the Government to design the \nInvestment Program with TA support to fund selected activities under the road map. \n \n23.  This design of the road map for IWRM in the CRB is based on sound strategic planning \nprinciples and followed a highly participatory approach involving extensive consultations with \nkey stakeholder representatives in all relevant sectors and at a number of levels. The process \nbegan with identifying a stakeholder vision for the basin\u2019s future to the year 2023 and several \nIWRM key areas, for which specific objectives were developed (Figure 1). The road map sets \nout the agreed interventions up to 2023 that will be required to achieve the specific objectives \nset for each key area. The initial estimate of the cost of the full suite of road map interventions is \n$3.5 billion. The road map is summarized in Appendix 6, and the complete road map is given in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nFigure 1: Strategic Framework for IWRM in the Citarum River Basin \n \n \n      IWRM = integrated water resources management. \n      Sources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Indonesia. \n \n                                                 \n14   ADB. 2006.

Impact and Outcome  \n24.  The expected impact of the Investment Program is reduced poverty and improved health \nand living standards in the CRB. The expected outcome is improved IWRM in the CRB.  \n \n25.  The Investment Program will cover the Citarum River Basin Territory, which consists of a \ncluster of river basins. The 6,600 km2 Citarum River hydrological basin itself lies in the central \npart of the program area and flows from the central highlands of West Java north into the Java \nSea. A group of small basins covering 4,400 km2 (the Ciherang, Cilamaya, Ciasem, Cipunegara, \nand Cipancuh rivers) have drainage areas connected to the Citarum River system through the \nEast Tarum Canal. The Cikarang and Bekasi rivers have a combined drainage area of 2,000 \nkm2 and are also connected with the Citarum River via the WTC.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs  \n26.  The Investment Program comprises interventions grouped according to the road map \nkey areas identified during the road map development process (Figure 1). The investment \nprogram components are (i) institutions and planning for IWRM; (ii) water resource development \nand management; (iii) water sharing; (iv) environmental protection; (v) disaster management; \n(vi) community empowerment; (vii) data, information, and decision support; and (viii) program \nmanagement. The criteria for selecting interventions included (i) the importance and urgency of \nthe intervention; (ii) its potential contribution to implementing IWRM; (ii) whether it is more \nappropriate for funding by other donors, the private sector, communities, or the Government \nitself; (iii) the need to ensure simple implementing arrangements; and (v) a focus on sectors \nwhere ADB can add value or has traditionally partnered with the Government.  \n \n27.  The outputs from the components of individual projects under the Investment Program \nmay be many and varied. Because of the flexible nature of the MFF modality, outputs and timing \nfor projects beyond the first tranche are necessarily indicative and based on the respective \nproject scope and schedule agreed with the Government at the time of loan preparation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework summarizes the planned outputs for the Investment Program, \nwhich are grouped by components following the road map key areas and are described below. \nProject 1 outputs are highlighted (see the periodic financing request for Project 1).  \n \n28.  Component 1: Institutions and Planning for IWRM. The term \u201cinstitutions\u201d is used in \nits broadest sense, including organizations and the legislation, policies, and other protocols that \ndefine relations among them. IWRM and river basin planning is seen as a mechanism for \npromulgating and implementing government policies and, as such, is included in this key area. \nAssistance will be provided to support key government agencies involved in IWRM in the CRB. \nActivities  include  organization  restructuring,  organizational  capacity  building,  policy \ndevelopment, legislation, planning for IWRM,16 regulation such as licensing water utilization and \nwastewater  discharge,  setting  water  tariffs,  and  strengthening  institutions  for  participatory \nirrigation management. Project 1, including its supporting TA, provide considerable support to \nthese water resource institutions in the CRB and the 6 Cis River Basin Territory. \n \n29.  Component 2: Water Resource Development and Management. Investments are \naimed  at  activities  to  efficiently  exploit  water  resources  by  increasing  water  availability  to \n                                                 \n16 As distinct from project planning. \n ", "    9  \n \nauthorized users and effectively operating and maintaining the infrastructure developed in the \nprocess.  The  main  activities  included  are  project  planning,  which  focuses  on  developing \ninfrastructure and incorporates water-related climate change adaptation needs; constructing \ninfrastructure for storing and delivering water, including reservoirs, canals, and groundwater and \npipeline systems; operating and maintaining infrastructure; and promoting the  efficient and \neffective utilization of water. The Investment Program has been designed to include several \ninterventions  aiming  specifically  to  increase  the  sustainable  water  yield  of  the  basin  to \naccommodate projected growth in demand. These include supplementing groundwater supplies \nto Bandung with surface water from the upper basin, raising the capacity of the existing Cirata \nReservoir,  and  evaluating  options  for  increasing  water  supply  in  the  Bekasi  urban  area. \nInvestments will increase the capacity of the existing water supply infrastructure to address \nissues of bulk water supply to key irrigation areas and domestic, municipal, and industrial water \nsupply to Jabodetabek and Bandung. Project 1 will rehabilitate the 54 km Curug\u2013Bekasi stretch \nof the WTC, a high Government priority, including renovating intake mechanical and electrical \nworks, improving canal capacity, installing protection fencing, improving access roads, adding \nriver crossing siphons, and rehabilitating gates and water management structures. Project 1 \nincludes community-led efforts to (i) improve on-farm irrigation management over 3,000 ha in \nthe three districts and 16 subdistricts in the WTC command area; and (ii) improve water supply \nand sanitation facilities following participatory planning and design, with local communities along \nthe WTC developing and implementing water supply and sanitation works under community \naction plans.  \n \n30.  Component 3: Water Sharing. Investments aim to establish and protect water rights, \nallocate water among competing uses and users, and set priorities for water entitlement during \ntimes of shortage.  \n \n31.  Component 4: Environmental Protection. Investments in a combination of structural \nand other measures aim to protect the environment of rivers, lakes, wetlands, forests, and other \nnatural ecosystems with impact on water management and rehabilitate and enhance degraded \nenvironments,  both  aquatic  and  terrestrial.  Activities  include  building  wastewater  treatment \nplants,  the  community  development  of  solid  waste  and  sanitation  facilities,  improving \ninstitutional regulatory arrangements, and encouraging community participation and behavioral \nchange.  The  Investment  Program  includes  inputs  to  address  many  of  the  environmental \nproblems faced in the basin. A comprehensive study will be carried out under the first tranche to \nidentify appropriate priority water quality and quantity improvements and potential investment \nopportunities that will be implemented under later tranches. Project 1 includes initial community-\ndriven environmental improvements and the protection of ecosystems in about 30 villages and \ncommunities adjacent to seven protected areas in the upper basin. These activities will be \nfunded by a grant from GEF administered by ADB. \n \n32.  Component 5: Disaster Management. Investments are aimed only at those disasters \nrelated to water such as floods and mud flows. While drought must also be classified as a \nwater-related  disaster,  the  strategic  response  to  drought  mitigation  is  to  increase  water \navailability,  which  is  included  above  under  the  key  area  of  water  resource  development. \nActivities related to disaster management under this definition include planning and constructing \nstructures to control flood and mud flows such as levees, dikes, and flood control reservoirs; \ndeveloping and implementing disaster preparedness plans, flood plain management, and flood \nforecasting and warning systems; and providing public information on flood risks. Urgent flood \nprotection works in the upper basin will be prioritized under Project 2 after option studies and \nengineering designs have identified optimal solutions under Project 1. \n \n ", "10  \n33.  Component 6: Community Empowerment. Involving the community in planning and \nimplementing  IWRM  activities  is  essential.  It  is  considered  a  \u201cfoundation\u201d  key  area,  as  it \nsupports the five \u201cpillar\u201d key areas described above. The strong feeling among stakeholders is \nthat empowering the community to participate should be an important theme of the Investment \nProgram.  In  this  context,  community  empowerment  includes  (i)  the  education,  awareness \nraising, and capacity building of communities and individuals on water management issues; (ii) \nactivities aiming to provide information to all that need it on water resource management and \nrelated activities; (iii) implementing measures to facilitate the participation of the community in \nwater planning and management; and (iv) developing community-based self-help programs and \nspecific projects to provide local improvement in water supply, the environment, and water \nquality. Starting in Project 1, a community-based approach will be taken to the problem of \ndegraded community environmental and health status in peri-urban and rural communities, \nempowering local communities through awareness raising and capacity building to supplement \nlocal efforts to implement improved community water supply and sanitation facilities. \n \n34.  Component 7: Data, Information, and Decision Support. This is another foundation \nkey area, as data is fundamental to all aspects of water resource management. It includes \ncollecting, validating, archiving, managing, and disseminating relevant data covering surface \nand groundwater quantity and quality, as well as other natural resource data such as on soils, \ngeology,  land  cover,  and  ecosystems,  including  such  socioeconomic  data  as  population, \npoverty, and land use. This key area includes research into such fields as catchment processes \nand  demography;  developing  new  technologies  for  water  conservation  and  environmental \nprotection;  and  developing  and  implementing  decision-support  tools,  including  geographic \ninformation systems, hydrologic and hydraulic models, and other analytical tools. \n \n35.  Component 8: Program Management. Program management activities will support (i) \neffective  liaison  between  program  stakeholders  and  the  teams  undertaking  component \nsubprojects so that outcomes align with stakeholders needs; (ii) effective coordination among \ncomponents to promote cooperation and information exchange, improve performance overall, \nand minimize wasted effort caused by overlaps; and (iii) accurate and timely monitoring and \nreporting of investment program and Project 1 performance, including financial management. \nMonitoring and evaluation will be included, with the establishment and management of a road \nmap performance management system and an investment program performance management \nsystem. \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  Multitranche Financing Facility. The Investment Program will be funded through an \nMFF. The rationale for this derives from the broad agenda of the road map, which involves the \nprovision over 15 years of water-related infrastructure and services across a number of IWRM \nkey areas throughout the CRB. The MFF will enable flexibility in investment decisions and \ntiming based on the needs and constraints from downstream to upstream within a framework, \ninstead of a precise definition of investments up front as required in a conventional modality. It \nwill allow implementation to be based on the readiness of individual projects, as under the MFF, \nfunds will be made available in a phased manner subject to the eligibility and readiness of \nprojects. The MFF will allow ADB and the Government to develop a long-term partnership for \nsupporting the long-term vision of CRB stakeholders in a sustainable manner. It will allow long-\nterm engagement for building capacity in IWRM in a realistic timeframe. Finally, the MFF will \nprovide  flexibility  to  match  various  funding  sources  available  to  the  central  and  regional \n ", "    11  \n \ngovernments; leverage private and community investments; and allow the Government to plan \nefficiently and effectively with other funding institutions. \n \n37.  Community-Driven  Development  and  Participatory  Approaches.  The  Investment \nProgram  supports  community  and  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)-driven  participatory \napproaches for many of the outputs. Communities will decide priority areas and the type of \ntechnology to be used on a number of subcomponents, with community participation in the \ndevelopment of water and sanitation systems, environmental improvements, and on-farm water \nmanagement. Community groups will be strengthened to lead planning and implementation \nactivities  with  the  assistance  of  community  facilitators  trained  by  qualified  NGOs  and  will \npermanently take charge of operating and maintaining the works constructed. NGOs have \nparticipated in dialogues on preparing road maps and detailed subcomponents, as well as in \ninitial pilot IWRM demonstration activities in the CRB. Singularly and in informal networks, \nNGOs are already active in many activities that complement, synergize, or form part of the road \nmap. Increased engagement with and support to communities working with NGOs is designed \ninto Project 1, as communities and civil society organizations (CSOs) become more active in \npolicy making, planning, implementation, management, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n38.  Corporate  Social  Responsibility.  Many  large  and  medium-sized  companies  in \nIndonesia practice corporate social responsibility. Awareness of the importance of this is now a \nglobal trend and, if applied properly, it can be one of several solutions for breaking through the \nbarrier between fulfilling the needs of the poor and profit seeking. Both profits and fulfilling \nneeds can advance side by side toward empowering the poor and sustainable environmental \nprotection. The Investment Program has significant potential to initiate and sustain cooperation \nwith some big textile companies and other firms that rely on basin water and show interest in \nproviding support to community initiatives to improve river water quality and community water \nand sanitation supply.  \n \n39.  Environmental  Improvement  Compensation.  A  special  feature  of  the  Investment \nProgram will be the development of compensation mechanisms for communities that actively \ncontribute to protecting the land and water of the CRB, or paying for environmental services. An \nADB-assisted17 pilot demonstration of paying for environmental services commenced in the \nCRB with the objectives of (i) introducing and increasing understanding of this mechanism in \naccordance with the water law, (ii) strengthening the commitment of users of land and water to \nsupport  compensating  farmers  who  contribute  by  taking  care  of  the  river  basin,  and  (iii) \npreparing government institutions for facilitating the implementation and promotion of payments. \n \n40.  River  Basin  Performance  Benchmarking.  The  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin \nOrganizations supports performance benchmarking as a priority network activity and works \nclosely  with  CRB  organizations  in  developing  benchmarking  tools  to  include  new  river \nperformance indicators to augment the network\u2019s existing river basin organization performance \nsystem. This ongoing work, carried out in collaboration with ADB and the University of Tokyo,18 \nhas been pilot tested in the CRB and will be used to set targets and monitor the performance of \nroad map implementation against its vision.  \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2006.

The  CRB  will  be  the  first  basin  in  Indonesia  with  a \ncomprehensive strategy for adapting to climate change. In collaboration with the University of \nTokyo19  and  the  Regional  Water  Knowledge  Hub  for  Climate  Change  National  Hydraulic \nResearch Institute of Malaysia, ADB assists with a climate risk assessment for the basin, which \nwill be developed under the Investment Program to climate-proof the road map. Financing for \nclimate-proofing the road map will be sought from internal and external sources.20 \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n1.  Investment Program \n42.  The cost of the Investment Program including contingencies is estimated at $921 million \n(Table 1). The financing plan is in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates and financing plans are in \nAppendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix D.   \n   \n43.  To finance the Investment Program, the Government has requested financing of up to \n$503.8 million equivalent, including up to $470 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) and up to $30 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources through \nthe MFF, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility,21 and a \ngrant of $3.8 million from GEF to be administered by ADB. Under the MFF, ADB will extend \nfinancial  assistance  to  four  indicative  project  tranches  to  support  the  Investment  Program \nsubject to the submission of a related periodic financing request (PFR) from the Government \nand the execution of the related loan agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a detailed \ncost estimate and an implementation schedule. The Government has entered into a framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA) with ADB which satisfies the requirements of the policy.22 The \nminimum amount of any PFR will be $10 million. \n \n44.  The proposed ADB loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, consulting \nservices,  and  capacity  building.  All  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans23 will apply to each loan from \nOCR,  subject  to  any  modifications  that  may  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment can choose from eligible currencies and interest rate regimes for each loan from \nOCR. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decisions to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n                                                 \n19 Yutaka, A. 2008.

Project 1 \n45.  Project 1 is estimated to cost the equivalent of $103.4 million, including taxes, duties, \ninterest, and other charges. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government submitted to ADB the first \nPFR, for a loan equivalent to $30.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and a loan of \n$20.0 million from OCR to cover part of the cost of Project 1. ADB funding is prioritized for \ncapacity building, community-driven infrastructure, and preparatory activities for future tranches \nwith OCR funding of larger infrastructure civil works on the WTC. The Government will finance \nabout $34 million mainly for land acquisition, resettlement, taxes, project administration support, \nand other costs including civil works. Beneficiaries will contribute about $3 million, mainly for \ncommunity-based management investments. The first PFR is submitted to the Board together \nwith the FFA for information. \n \n46.  On behalf of the Government, ADB asked GEF to provide grant funding for Project 1, \nand GEF provided concept approval of a grant of $3.8 million in May 2008. The grant, to be \nadministered  by  ADB,  will  cover  the  costs  of  activities  related  to  the  conservation  and \nmanagement  of  ecosystems  in  protected  areas  that  are  included  in  component  4  of  the \nInvestment Program. TA with a cost of $10.7 million ($1.0 million in ADB funds, a $5.0 million \ngrant from the Government of the Netherlands, a $2.0 million grant from the Multi-donor Trust \nFund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, and $2.7 million in Government funding) \nwill  be  implemented  to  provide  necessary  institutional  and  organizational  strengthening; \nestablish data, information, decision-support systems; and ensure the sustainable, long-term \nviability of the investments (see section IV). Parallel TA support for water quality modeling and \nCRB decision-support systems valued at $4.0 million equivalent has been proposed by Korean \nWater Resources Cooperation. Korean Water Resources Cooperation will administer this grant. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n47.  DGWR  will  be  the  Investment  Program  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  Investment \nProgram and Project 1. DGWR has established a project coordination and management unit \n(PCMU)  in  the  Balai  Besar  Wilayah  Sungai  Citarum,  to  be  responsible  for  managing  and \ncoordinating all project activities. Specifically, the PCMU will (i) ensure that annual work plans \n(AWPs) are submitted by PIUs in a timely manner and a standard format; (ii) review and \nconsolidate for all PIUs the AWPs and corresponding budget estimates; (iii) prepare and submit \nreports to ADB and the National Steering Committee for Water Resources (NSCWR); (iv) \ncompile the results of project monitoring and evaluation and convey the consolidated results to \nimplementing agencies and ADB; (v) liaise and coordinate with other funding agencies on \ncomplementary activities; (vi) organize coordination meetings and workshops with national, \nprovincial,  or  district  implementing  agencies  (IAs),  as  appropriate;  and  (vii)  arrange  for \nrepresentatives  of  implementing  agencies  to  assist  ADB  review  missions.  Routine \ncommunications from ADB on Project 1 will be addressed to the PCMU. In addition, a road map \ncoordination  and  management  unit  (RCMU)  has  been  established  within  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, or BAPPENAS) \nto ensure efficient and effective overall planning and financial management in national and local \ngovernments.  ADB,  the  RCMU,  and  the  EA  shall  coordinate  closely  on  road  map \nimplementation. The RCMU will primarily (i) ensure effective coordination among component \nroad map projects, (ii) review the prioritization of activities under the MFF and other funding, (iii) \nfacilitate consultation with stakeholders, (iv) liaise with bilateral and multilateral funding agencies \nand  the  private  sector,  and  (v)  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  road  map \n ", "    15  \n \nimplementation.  The  RCMU  and  PCMU  will  work  closely  with  the  NSCWR.  Project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will be established in each IA. Appendix 8 shows the proposed \ninvestment program management organization.  \n \n2.  Project Selection Criteria \n48.  While investment program projects are identified at this stage, the long-term nature of \nthe  Investment  Program  means  that  certain  adjustments  will  need  to  be  made  during \nimplementation to respond to changing needs over time. Readjustments will be made in a \nsystematic manner within the overall objectives of the Investment Program and carried out with \nappropriate due diligence. The project selection criteria that will be adhered to for PFR approval \nby ADB, as detailed in schedule 4 of the FFA, include the requirement for projects to be \nselected  from  the  road  map,  assurances  of  sound  technical  and  economic  viability,  and \ncompliance with Government and ADB environmental and social safeguards. Projects should \nhave funds available for long-term operation, and priority will be given to projects with multiple \nstakeholder involvement and community participation, in line with IWRM principles. \n \n3.  Approval Procedures for Projects and Project Components \n49.  Preparation has been completed for Project 1. For subsequent projects, the approval \nprocedures will be as follows: (i) PIUs will propose a potential project consistent with the road \nmap to the PCMU and the RCMU; (ii) following RCMU and PCMU concurrence, the PIU will \nprepare (a) project appraisal reports and feasibility studies, including scope, technical viability \nassessments, cost, and financing and implementation arrangements; (b) an initial environmental \nexamination and, if required, an environmental impact assessment; (c) a resettlement plan if \nrequired; and (d) economic, financial, and institutional analyses; (iii) the PCMU will appraise \nproposed projects in full consultation with river basin stakeholders, assessing the compliance of \neach project with the selection criteria and then submitting it for RCMU and ADB prior review \nbefore  submitting  a  PFR;  and  (iv)  following  concurrence  on  projects  by  ADB,  the  PCMU, \nthrough DGWR and BAPPENAS, will submit them in the form of a PFR for the endorsement of \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) and onward transmittal to ADB. \n \n50.  PFRs will include (i) the required loan amount; (ii) a list of projects to be financed under \nthe  loan;  (iii)  a  cost  estimate  and  financing  plan;  (iv)  implementing  arrangements;  (v) \nconfirmation of the validity of, and adherence to, the provision of the FFA; (vi) confirmation of \ncompliance with the provisions under previous loan agreements as appropriate; and (vii) due \ndiligence on safeguards. \n \n4.  Implementation Period of the Investment Program \n51.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 15 years from 2009 to 2023, the \nindicative scheduling of the project tranches is shown in Appendix 9. The MFF availability period \nis 10 years from 2009 to 2018. The RCMU, PCMU, and PIUs have been established. PIUs have \ncommenced advance procurement and preparatory activities, including safeguard compliance. \nImplementation will commence with the (i) full operational effectiveness of the PIUs, RCMU, and \nPCMU; (ii) engagement of consultants; (iii) detailed engineering design of the main works and \nconstruction of the Bekasi siphon on the WTC; (iv) institutional assessments and diagnostics; \n(v) CSO stakeholder mobilization and media campaigns; (vi) identification of target villages for \nProject 1, (vii) assistance in establishing and strengthening the 6 Cis River Basin Territory \nWater Council; (viii) capacity building; and (ix) data gathering, establishment of information \n ", "16  \nsystems, and setting up of the road map and investment program performance monitoring \nsystems and their procedures. \n \n52.  The proposed four tranches of the MFF need not be implemented sequentially. The \nexact timing of the tranches after the first will be determined by circumstances current at the \ntime, including progress on previous projects. This will be determined by the Government. PFRs \nwill be submitted at the appropriate time, ensuring that preparation work has been completed so \nthat the next project can commence implementation without delay. Projects will overlap to some \ndegree. \n \n5.  Procurement \n53.  Procurements to be financed by the loans under the MFF will be carried out following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive \nbidding will be used for civil works contracts costing more than $5.0 million and for goods and \nrelated services contracts valued at more than $1.0 million. Civil works contracts costing $5.0 \nmillion or less, and goods supply contract packages of $1.0 million or less, will be procured \nusing  national  competitive  bidding.  Modifications  and  clarifications  required  to  put  national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  will  be \nincluded in the procurement plan. Goods and related service packages costing up to $100,000 \nwill  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  Civil  works  that  are  labor  intensive  will  be \ncontracted out to communities in compliance with the requirements for community participation \nin procurement, as specified in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, with a first contract ceiling of \n$10,000  equivalent  for  each  community  and  up  to  $30,000  equivalent  for  subsequent \ncommunity-participation contract packages. The contract packaging and procurement modes for \neach contract will be examined during ADB\u2019s processing of PFRs and will be finalized during \nloan negotiations for each project. In addition, procurement plans will be prepared for each \nproject to be financed under the Investment Program, indicating the particular contracts for \ngoods, works, and consulting services required; proposed methods of procurement; thresholds; \nand  related  ADB  procedures.  Appendix  10 details  the procurement  plan for Project  1.The \nGovernment has requested, and ADB has approved, advance contracting for the procurement \nof civil works pertaining to the West Tarum Canal for Project 1. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance any project.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n54.  All consultants financed under the Investment Program will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nProject 1 will require 301 person-months of international consultancy and 2,004 person-months \nof national consultancy to assist the RCMU, PCMU, and PIUs with program management, \nengineering  design,  construction  supervision,  quality  control,  community  empowerment, \ncapacity building, environmental and social safeguards, road map and investment program \nperformance monitoring, and project financial management. The contract packaging, selection, \nand engagement modes for each type of contract will be examined during ADB\u2019s processing of \nPFRs and finalized during loan negotiation for each project. The selection and engagement of \nrequired services for Project 1 will be through firms selected mainly under the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method. For contracts valued up to $0.2 million, the consultant qualification \nselection method will be followed. NGOs and national community facilitators will be recruited \nusing procedures acceptable to ADB. The selection of consultants for subsequent projects, \nwhere required, may follow single source selection to ensure continuity in the approach and the \nprofessional  liability  of  the  same  consultants  for  further  work,  subject  to  satisfactory \n ", "    17  \n \nperformance in previous assignments. Individual consultants may be recruited based on biodata \nsubmitted in response to specified terms of reference for assignments in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting individual consultants. The outline terms of reference and details of the \nconsulting  requirements  are  summarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  for  services  under \nProject 1. Advanced consultant recruitment has commenced. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n55.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, the EA, and the IAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included in the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the EA, IAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to projects under the Investment Program.  \n \n56.  Based on the Government\u2019s policy and experience in fighting corruption, the following \npreventive measures will be taken and further detailed in the program administration manual.24 \nEach IA will establish a procurement committee; civil works, equipment and other goods, and \nconsulting services will be procured in accordance with the Procurement Plan (Appendix 10). \nThe EA and each IA will undertake and make available to ADB annual inspection audits by an \napproved independent auditor.  \n \n57.  PIU  staff  will  be  trained  on  appropriate  procurement  and  financial  management \nprocedures set forth in applicable provisions of ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s procurement, \naccounting, and auditing rules and regulations and the Investment Program\u2019s anticorruption \npolicy.  Financial  controls  will  be  established  through  periodic  review,  reconciliation,  and \nreporting of the status of fund releases, disbursements, and liquidation to the independent \nauditor.  All  community-based  activities  and  goods  procured  for  the  community  shall  be \nannounced  in  advance  on  village  notice  boards  and  through  facilitated  dialogue  with  the \ncommunity. The PCMU will engage the services of a consultant with expertise in fiduciary \narrangements and technical quality assurance, who will review semiannually or as deemed \nnecessary the project\u2019s physical and financial quality-assurance performance. The project will \nrequire strict documentation by its contractors on the use of project funds as the basis for further \nreleases. To ensure adherence to contractual obligations and the principle of value for money, \nthe office of the Ministry of Public Works Inspector General will, through routine inputs, build \ncapacity  in  the  PCMU  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  sound  quality-control  and  quality-\nassurance procedures for civil works and consulting services. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  Each loan under the MFF will have its own imprest account established at the Bank of \nIndonesia or a state-owned bank to be agreed between ADB and the Government. The initial \namount to be deposited into the imprest account for each loan shall not exceed (i) the estimated \n                                                 \n24 A program administration manual, to be prepared by the executing agency and agreed by ADB before any \nprocurement of services, works, or goods, shall provide adequate detail on anticorruption and quality control \nmeasures and quality assurance procedures consistent with good governance, accountability, value for money, \ntransparency, and results-based outputs.  \n ", "18  \nexpenditure for the first 6 months of the project for the loan or (ii) the equivalent of 10% of the \nloan amount, whichever is less. At the recommendation of the PCMU, MOF will advance funds \nfrom the imprest account on a quarterly basis to the designated bank accounts of the EA in \namounts sufficient to meet the quarterly requirements of the respective AWPs. Subsequent \nreleases of funds to bank accounts of individual IAs will be made upon the submission of \nexpenditure  statements  and  supporting  documents  to  the  PCMU.  Funds  for  community-\nconstructed works will be disbursed to the bank accounts held by communities based on the \nquarterly requirements of the approved AWP. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure \nwill be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating advances made to the imprest \naccount. PIUs will prepare SOEs for expenditures incurred by them and submit these to the \nPCMU for review, consolidation, and submission to MOF. The SOE procedure will be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances for payments from the account not \nexceeding the equivalent of $100,000 per item of expenditure. \n \n59.   Each PFR will be under a separate loan agreement. The loan agreement will describe \nthe detailed disbursement arrangements for a specified PFR, which will be discussed and \nagreed between ADB and the Government. Loan disbursements will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n60.  The  PCMU  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  summarizing  overall \ninvestment program progress, including the implementation of environmental management and \nresettlement plans, if required. In addition, the PCMU will prepare consolidated AWPs and \ncorresponding budgets and submit them to NSCWR for review, approval, and forwarding in a \ntimely manner to ADB. The EA will submit a consolidated project completion report to ADB \nwithin 3 months of the completion of each project loan. IAs will each establish and maintain \nseparate account and records. To ensure accountability, transparency, and sound financial \nmanagement,  the  Investment  Program  provides  for  an  independent  audit  by  a  national \naccounting and/or auditing agency with international affiliation. Audit reports shall be submitted \nto ADB annually within 6 months of the end of each calendar year. The audit reports will include \nan audit opinion on the use of the imprest account, and SOE procedures shall also be provided. \nThe PCMU will (i) submit to ADB the progress reports of each IA on a quarterly basis, and (ii) \nprepare and submit to ADB semi-annual consolidated progress reports for each project under \nthe MFF, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. The EA will actively monitor \nfeasibility,  preparation,  and  final  design  activities  in  accordance  with  the  program \nimplementation schedule and keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from it. Financial \nmanagement assessments of the IAs for Project 1 are summarized in Appendix 11, with details \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n61.  The  RCMU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  through  NSCWR  biannual  road  map \nprogress reports, the form on content of which will be agreed with ADB. \n \n10.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n62.  Within 6 months of effectiveness of the first loan, the RCMU will establish a road map \nperformance management system (RPMS) for the overall road map investment, and DGWR will \nestablish an investment program performance management system (IPPMS) in the PCMU. The \nRPMS and IPPMS designs shall be acceptable to ADB. They will use a results-based approach \nto monitoring and evaluating implementation performance and development impact at various \nstages of the project cycle and ensure the timely feedback of this information to decision makers \n ", "    19  \n \nfor action. The IPPMS will incorporate five interlinked elements: (i) the investment program \ndesign and monitoring framework, which will be the basis of the system; (ii) ADB\u2019s project \nperformance  reports  for  assessing  and  recording  performance  during  implementation;              \n(iii) monitoring and evaluation by the EA and IAs to provide inputs to the system, supplemented \nby routine ADB reviews; (iv) borrower and ADB self-evaluations of project performance; and (v) \npost-project  independent  evaluations  3  to  5  years  after  the  completion  of  internal  project \nperformance reviews. Participatory monitoring and evaluation systems will be introduced. A \ndatabase of key benchmark indicators will be established by the RCMU and become a part of \nthe project monitoring system within 9 months of effectiveness of the first loan under the \nInvestment Program. In close coordination with PIUs and the PCMU, the RCMU will update and \nanalyze key performance indicators at least twice per year and in greater detail immediately \nbefore the midterm review and completion of any project loan. \n \n63.  Where  appropriate,  the  RPMS  will  be  integrated  into  the  management  information \nsystems of regional governments and the Water Council so that the monitoring of benefits can \ncontinue beyond project implementation. Annual reports will be prepared by each PIU and then \nconsolidated by the PCMU and submitted to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for \nproject performance management systems. In addition, the Investment Program will help the \nNSCWR  to  (i)  develop,  in  close  coordination  with  the  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin \nOrganizations, IWRM river basin performance benchmarking systems for use by the river basin \norganizations  and  the  Water  Council;  and  (ii)  develop  road  map  and  investment  program \nsystems for financial investment planning, monitoring, and evaluation. The Water Council\u2019s \nstate-of-the-basin report will include an update on the status of road map and investment \nprogram implementation.  \n \n11.  Program Review \n64.  During the initial 3 years of Investment Program implementation, ADB will carry out \nsemiannual  reviews  to  (i)  ensure  that  the  implementation  arrangements  are  in  place  and \nappropriate; (ii) assess implementation performance and the achievement of project outcomes \nand  objectives  against  the  agreed  implementation  schedule,  identify  bottlenecks,  and,  in \nconsultation with the Government, agree on a time-bound action plan for their resolution; (iii) \nensure that ADB safeguards and other conditions set out in the loan agreements are being met; \n(iv) assess progress made in mobilizing CSOs; and (v) assess the readiness for Project 2 \nimplementation. In addition ADB will assist in an annual peer review of the CRB state-of-the-\nbasin report with CRB and annual road map funding reviews with NSCWR, the RCMU, and \nprospective donor agencies. Three years following the effective date of the first loan under the \nInvestment Program, ADB will field a comprehensive midterm review mission for Project 1, \nwhich will assess performance, identify problems affecting project implementation, and reach \nformal  agreement  with  the  Government  on  changes  on  the  scope  or  implementation \narrangements of Project 1 and the Investment Program required to address these shortfalls. \nThe terms of reference of the midterm review mission will be developed jointly by the EA and \nADB during the second and third year of the Investment Program. Before the mission, the \nGovernment will submit to ADB a detailed progress report. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n65.  Subsequent to developing the road map for IWRM in the Citarum Basin, the Government \nhas  designated  the  river  basins  of  the  Citarum,  Ciliwung-Cisdane,  and  Ciujung-Cidanua-\nCidurian as sub-basins of a new natural planning unit territory of national strategic importance, \nimportant for the future water supply of Jakarta and its satellite urban and industrial areas. The \n ", "20  \nterritory has a total population of 35 million people and has been termed the \u201c6 Cis25 River Basin \nTerritory.\u201d The CRB is the largest and most strategic of the six rivers, but the 6 Cis River Basin \nTerritory will be managed under a coordinated framework plan that recognizes both the role of \nwater  in  fulfilling  economic  development  targets  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  the  diverse \nindividual characteristics and needs of each of the six sub-basins. Since early 2007, ADB has \nbeen providing technical assistance in institutional capacity building to the 6 Cis River Basin \nTerritory and sub-basin institutions.26 To provide institutional support to the Investment Program \nand Project 1 IWRM activities in the CRB and to extend planning and programming support to \nthe rest of the 6 Cis River Basin Territory, the Government has asked ADB to provide TA \nsupport to strengthen institutions for IWRM in the 6 Cis River Basin Territory.  \n \n66.  Impact and Outcome. The desired impact of this TA is the sustainable management of \nwater resources. The immediate objectives are to (i) improve capacity for IWRM in the 6 Cis \nRiver Basin Territory, and (ii) ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the Investment \nProgram. \n \n67.  Methodology and Key Activities. The TA will be implemented to support Project 1 and \nprovide a solid base for long-term investments in the CRB under the Investment Program by \nstrengthening institutions, policies, and strategies for the 6 Cis River Basin Territory, including \ninstitutional strengthening for IWRM, road map institutional strengthening, and the development \nof key policies and strategies for water resource management. The TA will provide a solid base \nfor data support and decision-support systems in the CRB through the development of spatial \nplanning, decision-support systems for IWRM, and tools for flood modeling in the upper Citarum \nBasin.  A  summary  of  key  TA  outputs  and  inputs  is  provided  in  Appendix  12.  Detailed \ndescriptions have been drafted and are given in the terms of reference for TA activities along \nwith a design and monitoring framework for the TA in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n68.  Implementing  Arrangements  and  Costs.  DGWR  will  be  the  EA  for  the  technical \nassistance which will be implemented from January 2009 to December 2012. IAs will provide \noffice accommodation, equipment, and counterpart technical support to TA project teams. An \nestimated 124 person-months of international consultancy and 310 person-months of national \nconsultancy will be engaged by ADB using procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using quality-based selection \nmethod for firms or through recruitment of individual consultants. All equipment will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \ntotal cost of the TA is estimated at $10.7 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed as a grant \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program, $5.0 million will be financed as a grant from the Government of \nthe Netherlands and administered by ADB, and $2.0 million will be financed from the Multidonor \nTrust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining costs of $2.7 million. The cost estimates and financing \nplan is in Appendix 12. \n \n                                                 \n25 Ci means \u201criver\u201d in the local West Java Sudanese language. \n26  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Effective Water Management Policies and Practices (Phase 5). Manila (TA-\n6325-REG). \n ", "    21  \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Policy Impact and Institutional Benefits  \n69.  The Investment Program and associated technical assistance will have a significant \nimpact on river basin management policy and promote change in several institutional areas. The \ndevelopment of the road map for IWRM under the project preparatory TA provides an important \ntool  for  the  Government  to  direct  future  investments  in  sectors  related  to  water  and  land \nmanagement in the CRB. That the Government requested ADB to fund part of that road map \nthrough the Investment Program represents a policy shift from traditional single-sector program \nand project loans.  \n \n70.  Additionally, many of the proposed component projects under the Investment Program \ninclude policy operationalization, planning, and organizational strengthening. This is true for \nrelevant government organizations at the national, provincial, and district level, as well as for \nNGOs and the community at large. The benefits of these initiatives, although difficult to quantify, \nare likely to be substantial if the Investment Program is successfully implemented. Strengthened \ninstitutions and a firm policy basis for IWRM will lead to a more effective and holistic approach \nto water and land management at the basin level and below in the CRB. Increased water \navailability and cleaner and healthier rivers and catchments will bring higher productivity for \nagriculture and industry; provide greatly improved water supply and sanitation in urban, peri-\nurban,  and  rural  areas;  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  basin  inhabitants.  This  new \nmultisectoral  approach  to  river  basin  management  is  potentially  a  model  for  river  basins \nelsewhere in Indonesia and provides an example for other countries in the region that have \nembraced IWRM as a concept but may be struggling to implement it effectively. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits and Impacts \n71.  The main quantifiable benefits of Project 1 are those arising from (i) the additional  \n19.6  m3/second  of  water  flow  for  Jakarta,  Curug,  and  Bekasi;  and  (ii)  the  additional  \n4.5 m3/second of water flow for paddy cultivation. The main impacts of Project 1 are (i) the water \nsupply from Jatiluhur and the WTC increased by 2.0% annually; (ii) the water supply for Jakarta \nincreased by 2.5% annually; (iii) an additional 200,000 households in Jakarta provided with \npiped water annually; and (iv) factories in the Jakarta area increasing their water usage by 2.0% \nannually. The rehabilitation of the WTC will provide sufficient water to cultivate 117,600 ha of \npaddy, as compared with 91,800 ha in the without-project situation, increasing the annual paddy \ncropped area by 25,800 ha by 2025. This will increase paddy cropping intensity from 1.53 to \n1.93. A total of 25,800 farmers, each cultivating an average annual area of 1.0 ha of paddy (two \ncrops per year on 0.5 ha holdings), will benefit from this increase in crop area. The economic \ninternal rate of return of the Project 1 investments is estimated at 28%, and the sensitivity \nanalysis shows project benefits stable under possible adverse conditions. In addition to the \nquantifiable  benefits,  the  project  will  provide  a  series  of  environmental  benefits,  including \nreduced soil erosion and water pollution and the sustainable use of ground water. Appendix 13 \npresents  a  summary  of  the  financial  and  economic  analyses,  details  of  which  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \nC.  Social Benefits and Impacts \n72.  Poverty. There are clear links in the CRB between poverty and access to water and \nsanitation (Appendix 2). However, it is not only water and sanitation that must be tackled to \nprovide a sustainable, long-term impact on poverty in the CRB. The Investment Program will \n ", "22  \nprovide  a  holistic  approach  to  basin  management  with  a  set  of  integrated  outputs  that \ncollectively will significantly reduce poverty. The poverty impact ratio, which is a measure of the \nnet economic benefits to the poor from Project 1, is 19.4%. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is provided in Appendix 14. \n \n73.  Gender.  The  project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  The  project \nimpacts were assessed along with potential associated risks. Gender issues are of particular \nimportance in the water resources sector. Ongoing and proposed interventions will incorporate \nspecific actions to ensure that women are appropriately consulted at the planning stage and are \nfully involved in implementation. The proposed interventions will incorporate measures such as \nthe mandatory representation of the women in community committees responsible for planning, \nimplementing  and  monitoring  activities.  In  addition,  gender-awareness  training  will  be \nincorporated into intervention designs to help ensure that women have equitable access to \nresources and benefits. The gender action plan is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n74.  Sanitation and Health. The project includes a health and sanitation program to provide \npotable water and public toilets to communities affected by Project 1 WTC activities, beginning \nwith the provision of alternative household water supply and toilets for communities that now \npipe water from the canal and have built platforms over the canals for bathing, laundry, and \ntoilet use. The provision of water supply and sanitation will include the development of a \nsustainable  community-based  operation-and-maintenance  program  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation education.  \n \n75.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. A resettlement framework has been prepared to \nguide the preparation of land acquisition and resettlement plans for the Investment Program \n(Appendix 15 and Supplementary Appendixes J and K). A full resettlement plan has been \nprepared for Project 1. The main impacts are associated with works along the WTC where, \naccording to the inventory of losses, 800 informal settler households will be displaced from their \nhomes and/or shops when they are required to clear the inner banks of the canal. \n \nD.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n76.  The environmental assessment and review framework developed for the Investment \nProgram specifies procedures for examining more closely the impacts of projects to be included \nunder each MFF project loan to ensure consistency with the basin-wide assessment framework \nand  compliance  with  ADB  and  Government  environmental  assessment  requirements  for \nindividual projects. The initial environmental examination for Project 1 was undertaken for the \npurposes of compliance with ADB environmental assessment guidelines. No additional study or \nfull environmental impact assessment is needed for Project 1 (Appendix 16 and Supplementary \nAppendixes  L  and  M).  However,  individual  subprojects  with  potential  adverse  impacts, \nspecifically the WTC rehabilitation and the construction of communal septic tanks, must comply \nwith procedures under the Indonesia\u2019s environmental compliance system. \n \nE.  Sustainability and Financial Analysis \n \n77.  The sustainability of the outcomes of this Investment Program is critical for the efficient \nuse of the loan and associated funds. More importantly, sustainable outcomes are required to \nimprove  the  environmental  amenities  of  the  basin  and  raise  the  living  standards  of  its \ninhabitants. The normal weighted average cost of capital is 7.0%, considerably lower than the \nproject  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  21.5%.  In  particular,  the  holistic  nature  of  the \nInvestment Program means that new infrastructure development is supported by improved and \n ", "    23  \n \nstrengthened institutional arrangements for their ongoing and sustainable management. It is \nimportant that the Government make the road map central to its long-term investment strategies \nfor the CRB. The road map is not to be viewed as a static document. Under the Investment \nProgram,  it  will  be  updated  regularly  in  response  to  changing  social,  institutional,  and \nenvironmental circumstances. \n \nF.  Risks \n \n78.  Commitment to Reform. The Government of Indonesia has shown its commitment to \nintegrated  water  resource  development  in  a  decentralized  environment  through  recent \nlegislation (Water Law No 7/2004 and Decentralization Laws No. 33 & 34/2004), long- and \nmedium-term policy setting, and integrated national budget planning. Notwithstanding this, the \nvisionary journey defined in the road map requires the implementation of a well-planned and \ncoordinated cross-sectoral set of integrated activities to achieve the objectives. Interagency \ncommitment to the Investment Program and road map implementation and ongoing reforms is \nessential. The MFF ensures the long-term engagement of ADB with multiple projects to sustain \nthe integrated approach and reform process. \n \n79.  Stakeholder Participation. Key project outcomes include stakeholder participation in \nIWRM through the implementation of specific activities using community-driven development \napproaches and, importantly, the mainstreaming of CSO involvement in CRB development and \nmanagement, strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation. A risk exists that the proposed \nWater Council will not develop into an independent organization with effective, grassroots CSO \nparticipation. To ensure effective stakeholder participation, the Investment Program will support \n(i)  a  community-driven  development  approach  to  project  design  and  implementation;  (ii) \nintensive media and awareness-raising campaigns; (iii) community and private sector behavior-\nchange activities; (iv) private sector involvement in IWRM through corporate social responsibility \nprograms;  (v)  support  to  community  empowerment,  governance  initiatives,  and  complaints \nmechanisms; and (vi) the adequate allocation of institutional support. \n  \n80.  Road Map Allocations and MFF Utilization. A risk exists that the road map will not be \nadequately funded or that program funds will not be fully or effectively utilized. The Investment \nProgram provides for (i) establishing a dedicated PCMU in BBWSC to coordinate with the Water \nCouncil and Government planning agencies centrally and regionally; (ii) a dedicated PIU for \neach project and subproject, with the MFF modality allowing PIU staff to gain experience and \nlessons  from  past  projects so  implementation  efficiencies  will  improve;  and  (iii)  support  to \nNSCWR  in  BAPPENAS  through  the  RCMU  to  coordinate  integrated  river  basin  planning, \nprogramming, and evaluation. DGWR, as the EA, and BAPPENAS have substantial positive \nexperience with externally funded projects. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n81.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances,  which  have  largely  been  incorporated  into  the  attached  FFA  and  will  be \nincorporated into the individual loan agreements, as appropriate, for each project financed \nunder the Investment Program. \n \n82.  Counterpart Funding, Road map Management, and CRB Performance Evaluations. \nThe Government will ensure that necessary counterpart funds are available and released on a \ntimely basis to implement the Investment Program and that funding is available in a timely \nmanner for funding related projects. The Government will annually update the Citarum road map \nimplementation program to incorporate revised estimates of the funding requirements for the \n ", "24  \nprojects and subprojects under the Investment Program. The Government will submit to ADB its \nannual state-of-the-basin report, which shall include detailed progress-of-performance indicators \nand evaluations of the realization of funding targets. \n \n83.  Policy Dialogue. The Government will keep ADB informed of, and exchange views on, \nsector issues, policy reform discussions with other multilateral or bilateral agencies that may \nhave implications for implementation of the Investment Program, and progress on institutional \nreforms  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  significant  policy \nproposals.  \n \n84.  Water Sector Institutional Framework. The Government will (i) by no later than 30 \nSeptember 2009, develop a framework for stakeholders discussions for 6 Cis River Basin \nTerritory organization and water council, (ii) by no later than March 2010, issue the first Annual \n\u201cState of the Citarum River Basin\u201d report; (iii) by no later than June 2010, have completed CRB \ninstitutional rationalization reviews, including among others: matching the roles, responsibilities \nand resources of  national and regional water resources management organizations (including \nPJT-2, CRB Balai Besar, provincial and district agencies) to ensure  rationalization of water \nresources and irrigation asset management and allocation of and management of needs based \nfunding for the Tarum canal systems and the Jatiluhur Irrigation systems, and (iv) by no later \nthan December 2011 established the 6 Cis River Basin Territory Water Council.  \n \n85.  Operation and Maintenance. Based on needs-based assessments, and starting in \n2010 and continuing throughout the Investment Program, Indonesia will ensure that adequate \nfunds are allocated in its annual routine budgets for the operation and maintenance of all water \nresources assets included in the Investment Program. Indonesia will encourage and support \nparticipatory contributions for asset management by users.  \n \n86.  Jakarta Water Delivery Through the West Tarum Canal. Indonesia will ensure that \nthe Bekasi-to-Cawang section of the WTC will be either rehabilitated to an adequate design \ncapacity or upgraded in line with the ongoing French Government funded feasibility studies and \ndetailed engineering design in a timely manner to ensure the availability of increased capacity \ncoinciding with the commissioning of the WTC Curug-to-Bekasi works funded under Project 1.  \n \n87.  Pollution. The Government will ensure that, in line with the expected results of the \nproposed CRB Pollution Control Action Plan, reforms are introduced to move from voluntary \ncontrols for polluters to controls based on legal enforcement and financial incentives. \n \n88.  Strategic Vision, Master Plan, and Spatial Planning. The Government will ensure the \nRoad map \u201cvision\u201d is used as a basis for the development of a strategic planning framework \n(Pola) and a water resources management plan (Rencana) (as required under Water Law No. \n7/2004), to be endorsed by the 6 Cis River Basin Territory Water Council and formalized by \nMinisterial Decree  by  31  December  2012  and  31  December  2013.  Future  regional  spatial \nplanning and strategic development plans will incorporate the goals of the Pola.  \n \n89.  Safeguards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  projects  financed  under  the \nInvestment  Program  are  carried  out  in  full  compliance  with  (a)  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  of  the  Government;  (b)  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  including  the  policies  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,27  the  environment,28  and  indigenous  peoples;29  and  (c)  the \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 1995.

For  Project  1  and  all  future  projects  to  be  financed  under  subsequent  individual \ntranches/loans, the Government ensures that completed resettlement plans for all projects and \nsubprojects included under a PFR are submitted prior to or with the PFR for approval. Each \nresettlement plan is (i) to be prepared based on the detailed feasibility studies (detail designs \nduring implementation may require updating of the resettlement plan) or detailed designs; (ii) to \ninclude  complete  information  on  full  census,  final  asset  inventory  and  valuation,  and  final \nbudget; (iii) to be made available to the affected people in draft and final forms, including \ninformation  on  measurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuation,  entitlements  and  special \nprovisions, grievance procedures, timing for payment, and displacement schedule; and (iv) to be \napproved by ADB prior to notice to proceed for civil works in any construction work zone. \nAffected people will be provided certain resettlement entitlements such as land and asset \ncompensation and transfer allowances, prior to their displacement, dispossession, or restricted \naccess.  \n \n91.  All subsequent projects under the Investment Program will be assessed independently \nfor environmental categorization and then prepared in compliance with ADB environmental \nguidelines.  The  Government  will  prepare  an  initial  environmental  assessment  or  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  including  an  environmental  management  plan  or  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) as required to be approved by the relevant government \nauthority. These will be submitted to ADB for review and approval. All civil works and consultant \ncontracts  under  the  projects  will  contain  provisions  requiring  compliance  with  the  initial \nenvironmental  assessment  or  initial  environmental  examination  during  project  design, \nconstruction, and operation. \n \n92.  Throughout the investment program implementation period, the Government will ensure \nthat sufficient funds are made available as and when necessary for the efficient and timely \nimplementation  of  resettlement  and  environmental  safeguard  activities.  Quarterly  project \nimplementation  reporting  shall  include  implementation  progress  of  the  (i)  environmental \nmanagement plans and measures taken under the initial environmental examination, EIA, and \nenvironmental  monitoring  carried  out  as  a  regular  part  of  project  implementation,  and  (ii) \nresettlement monitoring as detailed in the resettlement plan. These safeguard reports shall be \ndisclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n \n93.  External  Monitoring.  The  Government  will  engage  an  external  agency  or  a \nnongovernment organization, acceptable to ADB, to conduct external monitoring and evaluation \nof the resettlement process and impacts. Reports of the independent monitoring agency will be \nsubmitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. These reports shall be disclosed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n \n94.  Social Aspects. The Government will ensure that all civil works contractors (i) comply \nwith all applicable labor laws, (ii) use their best efforts to employ women and local people living \nin the vicinity of the project/subproject, (iii) disseminate information at worksites on the risks of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during construction, (iv) are \n ", "26  \nrequired not to differentiate between men and women\u2019s wages or benefits for work of equal \nvalue, and (v) will not use child labor. Contracts for all projects to be financed under the \nInvestment Program must include specific clauses on these undertakings, and compliance will \nbe strictly monitored. \n \n95.  Good Governance and Anticorruption. The Government will ensure that (i) relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in all bidding \ndocuments for the Investment Program, and (ii) all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe projects financed under the Investment Program include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of DGWR; IAs; community organizations; \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nInvestment Program.

Indonesia\u2019s 2004 Water Law No. 7 provides the enabling framework for integrated water \nresources management (IWRM). The implementation of IWRM in a river basin context is being \npromoted through the establishment of river basin management organizations (balai besar). In \nview of its strategic importance to the country, a combined basin comprising the Citarum, \nCisadane-Ciliwung, and Cidurian-Ciujung-Cidanau1 rivers has been designated as one planning \nunit under the policy guidance of a single basin council. It will be managed initially through three \nsub-basin balai besars. The proposed Dewan Air, or basin council, will represent national, \nprovincial, district, and other stakeholders, incorporating a balance between government and \nnongovernment representatives.  \n \n2.  The Balai Besar Wilayah Sungai Citarum (BBWSC) is a nationally funded river basin \norganization under the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) within the Ministry of \nPublic Works and has a wide management and development mandate within the geographic \nadministrative boundary of the Citarum River basin (CRB)2 territory. The CRB is designated a \nbasin of national strategic significance. The mandate of the BBWSC was broadened in 2006 \nunder  the  auspices  of  DGWR,  from  a  development  function  to  a  wider  development  and \nmanagement function. The provincial government of West Java maintains a CRB operational \nunit (balai) operating under the provincial water resources service. Most of the decentralized \ndistrict governments in the CRB include locally funded independent district water resources \nservice organizations. The sectoral mandates of these organizations overlap, and ad hoc role-\nsharing  arrangements  are  annually  reviewed  under  BBWSC  coordination  to  minimize  the \noverlap of budgets. In addition, within the CRB is a corporatized water resources operational \norganization under the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, called Perum Jasa Tirta 2 (PJT 2). \nPJT 2 operates primarily as a profit-oriented bulk water supplier to large water users such as \nhydropower,  water  supply,  and  irrigation  systems  and  maintains  some  of  the  larger \ninfrastructure including the Jatiluhur Dam and Tarum Canal (Appendix 8).  \n \n3.  Despite  attempts  to  improve  the  institutional  framework  for  river  basin  and  water \nresource  management,  there  appears  to  be  general  agreement  that  current  institutional \narrangements  are  highly  sectoral,  with  limited  effective  coordination,  and  that,  although \nregulatory frameworks and standards are generally in place, enforcement is weak.  \n \nB.  Subsector Assessments \n4.  Surface Water Management. Average annual demand from the Jatiluhur Reservoir has \nincreased from 140 cubic meters (m3) per second in 1996 to 156 m3 per second in 2004. In \n1996, the Jatiluhur system made adequate water releases for irrigation and domestic and \nindustrial supply through the West, North, and East Tarum Canals. However, in 2001, the \nsystem reportedly failed to meet water needs for 1.5 months during the dry season, and in 2005 \n                                                 \n1  Ci is the West Java Sundanese term for river. This group of rivers (the 6 Cis) surrounding Jakarta supplies and \ndrains the conurbation of Jabodetabek (the municipalities of Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi). \n2 The Citarum River basin is mainly in the province of West Java and covers 13,000 square kilometers (km2). It is a \ncluster of river basins consisting of (i) the 6,600 km2 Citarum River hydrological basin itself, which lies in the central \npart of the program area and flows from south to north into the Java Sea; (ii) the 4,400 km2 cluster of small basins \nwhose drainage areas are connected to the Citarum River system through the East Tarum Canal (the Ciherang, \nCilamaya, Ciasem, Cipunegara, and Cipancuh rivers); and (iii) the Cikarang and Bekasi rivers, with a combined \ndrainage area of 2,000 km2, which are connected with the Citarum River through the West Tarum Canal. \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nit failed to meet water needs for 5 months. Inflow into the Saguling Reservoir is decreasing. \nBetween 1986 and 1991, the dry season flow into the Saguling Reservoir was 38% of the \naverage annual flow. This percentage dropped to 36% between 1992 and 1997 and declined \nfurther  to  34%  in  1998.  Watershed  degradation  is  seen  as  the  principal  cause.  Denuded \ncatchments have reduced capacity to capture rainwater, causing high peak flows during the \nrainy months and correspondingly reducing the amount of water available in dry months. \n \n5.  Groundwater Management. A considerable portion of the region\u2019s water demand, in \nparticular that of Jakarta and Bandung, is supplied by groundwater. The rate of groundwater \nextraction is believed to be considerably underestimated, since a large portion of extraction \nactivities are not registered. In Bandung, an estimated 90% of the population, and 98% of the \nindustries,  rely  on  groundwater.  Modeling  studies  done  in  2002  suggest  that  recorded \ngroundwater extraction is only one third of the actual amount. The water table is reportedly \ndropping by up to 5 meters per year in some places. The cumulative water table fall since 1920 \nhas been 85 meters. In 2005, it was estimated that land subsidence had reached 0.8 meters. To \nobtain clean water, industrial wells have to be drilled to beyond 150 meters. \n \n6.  Erosion and Sedimentation. Watershed erosion is a serious problem in the upper river \nbasin, where hillsides are steep and the catchment denuded. Even on steep slopes, farmers \ncultivate annual crops, which do not provide adequate ground cover and protection from heavy \nmonsoon rains. The soils, derived from volcanic tuff, easily erode and are prone to landslides. \nHigh peak flows have increased the rate of riverbank erosion. Hydrologic flow regimes have \nbeen adversely changed by land degradation, notably the loss of adequate forest cover and the \nprevalence of hillside farming in the upper catchments. The degraded catchments have reduced \nthe capacity to capture rainwater, resulting in high peak flows during the rainy months that carry \nlarge amounts of eroded soil. At the entrance to Saguling Reservoir, the ratio of wet season \nhigh flows to dry season low flows has increased from 3.4 recorded in 1992 to 7.4 in 2003. As a \nresult, landslides and mud flows are frequent during the rainy season. These areas have \nerosion rates in excess of 60 tons per hectare (ha) per year. \n \n7.  Flooding. Flooding is a consequence mainly of changes in the river flow regime caused \nby changes in watershed conditions. As the water-retention capacity of the river catchments is \nreduced  by  denudation  and  land  conversion  for  urban  development,  flood  peaks  have \nincreased. The increased flood frequency and severity are invariably associated with destructive \nlandslides and mud flows. Around Bandung, flooding has become more frequent and severe in \nrecent times. Here, however, there is no single cause. In the lower basin near Jakarta, where \nthe Cikeas and Cileungsi rivers join to become the Bekasi River, converging floodwaters from \nthe two tributaries have caused perennial flooding in Bekasi city. Along the lower Citarum River, \nlevees  and  embankments  built  during  colonial  rule  help  confine  flooding  within  the  river\u2019s \nmeander zone and provide protection to the surrounding settlements. At the Citarum River \nmouth, the build-up of sediments has created sand dunes that impede floodwater discharge. \nCombined with the effect of high tides, the constricted river outlet causes frequent inundation of \nthe lower basin near the delta.  \n \n8.  Water Pollution. The  combined effects of untreated domestic sewage, solid waste \ndisposal, and industrial effluents have significantly increased river pollution loads. In the upper \nbasin, river water polluted with domestic and industrial wastes from the Bandung metropolitan \narea  is  funneled  into  the  Saguling  Reservoir.  At  the  inlet  to  the  reservoir,  water  quality \nmonitoring in the late 1990s showed that average annual biological oxygen demand (BOD) gets \nas high as 300 milligrams per liter. Pollution in the lower basin, particularly in the downstream \nportion of the West Tarum Canal (WTC), poses an even more urgent water quality problem. En \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nroute to Jakarta, the WTC intersects the Bekasi River, which drains an area rapidly being \ndeveloped for residential and industrial use. At the Bekasi River\u2019s confluence with the WTC, the \naverage annual BOD in 2004 was 48 milligrams per liter. The pollution load in the Bekasi River \nis caused by untreated household sewage, industrial wastewater, and solid waste dumped \nalong the riverbanks. The lack of proper solid waste management contributes to both pollution \nand flooding. Garbage deposited along canals and riverbanks contributes to the high BOD. It \nalso clogs drains and accumulates on riverbeds, reducing discharge capacity. Average daily \nsolid  waste  generation  is  estimated  at  6,500  m3/day,  of  which  about  1,500  m3/day  is  not \ncollected or properly disposed of. The uncollected garbage that invariably ends up accumulating \nin the drainage system and rivers thus amounts to something like 500,000 m3 annually. The \nestimated flow of solid waste into the Saguling Reservoir is 250,000 m3 per year.  \n \n9.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Many rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia suffer high \nincidence of diarrhea, intestinal worms,skin diseases, and other water-related diseases such as \n \nmalaria and dengue. Poor people in remote rural areas\u2014and particularly the children, women, \nand elderly among them\u2014are worse affected than others. While the mortality rate for children \nunder 5 years of age has decreased substantially, from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1967 to 35 in \n2000, it is still above that of such other Southeast Asian countries as the Philippines (30) and \nThailand  (25).  Diarrhea  remains  the  second  most  common  cause  of  death  among  young \nchildren, and it is the main reason that children\u2019s growth is stunted, particularly at 12\u201324 \nmonths. This situation results from inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, combined \nwith poor hygiene. \n \n10.  Irrigation and Drainage. Agriculture in Indonesia is dominated by irrigated rice. About \n82% of the rice produced in the country is grown under irrigation. Of the total irrigated area,  \n5.0  million  hectares  are  publicly  managed  and  1.2  million  hectares,  all  comprising  small \nsystems,  are  managed  by  farmers.  The  CRB  is  a  key  rice-producing  area,  with  some  \n390,000 ha of irrigated rice. The average cropping intensity is 155%, with an average paddy \nyield  of  4.5  tons  per  ha.  Investment  in  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  was  a  major \ncomponent of the Government\u2019s agriculture and rural development strategy from 1969 to 1999. \nIrrigation investments were economically efficient and helped to improve food security and \nreduce rural poverty, with rice production increasing at an annual rate of 4.8%. The intensive \ncultivation of rice, a labor-intensive crop, raised rural incomes and substantially contributed to \nreducing the incidence of rural poverty from 40% in 1970 to 17% in 1997. About 43% of the \ncountry\u2019s labor force is employed in agriculture, mostly in rice production and related activities. \nCommunity participation in irrigation development is recognized as being key to the sustainable \nmanagement of irrigation assets and appropriate development of new infrastructure.  \n \nC.  Linking Poverty and Water Management in the Citarum River Basin  \n \n11.  Ensuring that the poor have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation has \nbeen for some time a prominent topic of development programs, and specific targets have been \ninternationally agreed in the Millennium Development Goals. Figure A2 illustrates the direct \nlinkage in the Citarum River basin between poverty and household coverage of toilets and \naccess to clean water. However, the contribution of water management to poverty reduction \ngoes far beyond just water supply and sanitation. Clean water is essential for improving the \nhealth  and  livelihood  of  the  poor,  reducing  vulnerability,  and  providing  environmental \nsustainability in a number of ways: (i) waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and malaria \nflourish in such areas, and diarrhea is the second-leading killer of children under the age of 5 in \nIndonesia, with around 100,000 dying of diarrhea-related causes every year; (ii) poor people are \nthe last in line to get piped water, and an estimated 50 million urban poor in Indonesia are \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \nunconnected to piped water; (iii) many poor people, particularly women and children in rural \nareas, have to spend many hours each day fetching water, which reduces the time available for \neconomic and educational activities and increases health stresses; (iv) shallow groundwater is \nusually the first choice for household domestic water supply but makes aquifers vulnerable to \noverexploitation  by  industries,  in  addition  to  being  prone  to  pollution  from  domestic  and \nindustrial wastes that are severely damaging to health; (v) the poor have little or no access to \nproper toilet facilities, and women in particular suffer ill health as a result of not being able to \nuse  decent  sanitary  facilities;  (vi)  the  poor  have  limited  access  to  participation  in  setting \ngovernment policies and strategies related to water rights, water planning, and water operations \nand often have no voice or champions to improve their situation.  \n \n \nFigure A2: Poverty Levels and Coverage of Households with Clean Water  \nand Toilets in Citarum River Basin \n120 \n100 \nWater coverage \n80 \ne\ng\nra 60  Toilet coverage \ne\nv\no 40 \n% C Linear (Water \n20  coverage) \n0  Linear (Toilet \ncoverage) \n0  10 20 30\n% Poverty  \n \n  Sources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Indonesia. \n \nC.

The  objective  of  the  strategic  environmental  assessment  (SEA)  was  to  guide  the \nformulation of the basin road map with regard to stakeholder involvement, the formulation of a \nstrategy with a view to mainstreaming environmental management concerns, the identification \nof  projects,  overall  environmental  impact  assessment  taking  into  account  cumulative  and \ninteractive  impacts,  the  inclusion  of  specific  environmental  management  components,  and \nproposed procedures for follow-on environmental assessments of the program tranches and \nindividual projects. The SEA is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n2.  The strategic environmental assessment was carried out as an integral part of basin \nroad  map  development.  The  SEA  systematically  integrated  environmental  management \nconcerns  into  the  basin  strategic  plan.  It  established  a  tiered  approach  to  environmental \nassessment and planning, beginning with an assessment at the program level, then at the \nproject level, and finally at the subproject level. \n \n3.  The baseline environmental assessment carried out as part of the SEA will continue to \nserve as the basis for follow-on impact assessment of each project tranche of the Integrated \nCitarum Water Resources Management Investment Program (the Investment Program). As \nsuch, the basin-wide environmental assessment will serve as baseline for the follow-on project-\nlevel impact assessments.  \n \n4.  The SEA influenced the program design by incorporating the following recommended \nenvironmental design approaches and criteria:  \n \n(i)  Water supply concerns are closely linked to the management of water quality and \nthe environment. Poor water quality in the basin is making the available water \nunfit for use. The lack of protection in the watersheds to combat pollution and \nerosion is a principal cause of water quality degradation. The road map has been \ndesigned  with  a  balanced  concern  for  water  utilization,  water  quality \nmanagement, and environmental protection.  \n \n(ii)  The need to manage water resources within an integrated framework is occurring \nat a time when authorities and administrative bodies mandated to manage the \nresource  are  still  grappling  with  organizational  and  adjustment  problems. \nInstitution building is vital for the program to succeed. The road map design \nincludes  capacity  development  for  local  government  units  and  river  basin \nmanagement bodies operating in the basin.  \n \n(iii)  Sustainable strategies for rehabilitating degraded watersheds are those that aim \nto  reestablish  basic  ecosystem  processes.  A  balanced  approach  to  basin \nmanagement that addresses human-use values alongside ecological values was \nadopted in the design process. \n \n(iv)  Numerous entities affect water resources, not just industries. Communities in \nparticular are beyond the reach of conventional controls and affect the water \nsystem  in  small,  often  unnoticed  ways,  but  their  cumulative  result  is  highly \nsignificant. Unsustainable community practices often arise from lack of know-\nhow,  resources,  and  options.  The  road  map  addresses  this  aspect  by \nincorporating community participation and empowerment activities.  \n \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \n(v)  Indonesia\u2019s innovative and effective voluntary program for reducing industrial \nwastewater emissions has brought about large declines in biological oxygen \ndemand. However, they are not a permanent substitute for an institutionalized \nenvironmental  regulatory  and  enforcement  system.  The  program  addresses \nstrengthening the latter as a basis for sustainable water quality management.  \n \n(vi)  An important element of the program strategy is a call for water to be treated as \nan economic resource. Developing economic instruments to induce behavioral \nchange  in  water  use  and  water  pollution  has  also  been  incorporated  in  the \nprogram design (e.g., appropriate water pricing and pollution charges).  \n \n5.  The SEA management plan covers activities to (i) remediate or ameliorate existing \nenvironment  problems  that  significantly  affect  water  supply  and  quality;  (ii)  strengthen \nenvironmental  management  capacity  (i.e.,  regulatory  enforcement,  complementary  policy \ninstruments, monitoring system, databases, and decision-support tools); and (iii) mitigate the \npossible adverse environmental impacts of some projects, particularly those under the water \nutilization component. The SEA also provides a tiered approach linking program implementation \nmanagement with project and subproject environmental impact assessments (EIAs) through an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF).  \n \n6.  The SEA formulated the EARF to be used as guide in examining more closely the \nenvironmental impacts of specific subprojects and with the aim of ensuring consistency with the \nstrategic  impact  assessment  framework  and  compliance  with  ADB  and  Government  of \nIndonesia environmental assessment requirements for individual projects. \n \n7.  The Investment Program is expected to generate significant environmental benefits in \nterms  of  utilizing  more  efficiently  and  equitably  water  resources,  both  surface  water  and \ngroundwater; ensuring adequate supply to meet growing water demand from households and \nindustry; improving water quality; rehabilitating watersheds to ensure water supply sustainability \nand enhance the socioeconomic well-being of communities; and improving institutional capacity \nfor participatory basin management. \n \n8.  The stakeholder-driven program design integrates physical development works, notably \nwater infrastructure improvements, with measures to protect water sources and water quality, \nmeasures for water-related hazard mitigation, institutional and policy reform, improved data and \ndecision  support  systems,  and  community  empowerment.  Environmental  safeguards  are \nincorporated  into  the  road  map  both  as  proactive  measures  to  protect  and  sustain  water \nresources and preserve basin ecosystem functions, including biodiversity, and as mitigation \nmeasures to deal with any adverse impacts arising from some of the road map elements, \nnotably the water utilization components. Many of the proposed activities in the road map are \nthemselves environmental remediation or enhancement measures.  \n \n9.  No additional study or full-environmental impact assessment of the proposed Investment \nProgram or road map is needed to comply with ADB environmental assessment guidelines. \nHowever, as described under the EARF section of the report, the individual projects must \ncomply with the review and clearance procedures specified under Indonesia\u2019s environmental \nimpact-assessment system.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  39 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE IN THE SECTOR \n \n ($ million) \n \nItem  Amount  \nA.

Implementing Agencies and Implementation Arrangements \n1.  This financial management assessment focuses on assessing financial management \nissues and training requirements associated only with Project 1 of the Integrated Citarum Water \nResources Management Investment Program (the Investment Program).1 This is to ensure that \nthe Executing Agency (EA) and the project implementation units (PIUs) have the necessary \ncapability to manage the proposed project in a satisfactory way to meet the requirements of the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the Government) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  The  road  map  coordination  and  management  unit  (RCMU)  will  primarily  (i)  ensure \neffective coordination among component road map projects, (ii) review the prioritization of \nactivities  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  and  other  funding,  (iii)  facilitate \nconsultations with stakeholders, (iv) liaise with bilateral and multilateral donors and the private \nsector, and (v) monitor and evaluate the performance of road map implementation. \n \n3.  The program coordination and management unit (PCMU) will (i) ensure that annual work \nplans (AWPs) are submitted by the PIUs in a timely manner and in a standard format; (ii) review \nand consolidate for all PIUs the AWPs and corresponding budget estimates; (iii) prepare and \nsubmit reports to ADB and the National Steering Committee for Water Resources (NSCWR); \n(iv) compile the results of project monitoring and evaluation and convey the consolidated results \nto the implementing agencies and ADB; (v) liaise and coordinate with other donor agencies on \ncomplementary activities; (vi) organize coordination meetings and workshops with national, \nprovincial,  and  district  implementing  agencies  as  appropriate;  and  (vii)  arrange  for \nrepresentatives  of  the  implementing  agencies  to  assist  ADB\u2019s  review  missions.  Routine \ncommunications from ADB on Project 1 will be addressed to the PCMU. ADB, the RCMU, and \nthe EA shall coordinate closely on road map implementation. \n \n4.  All Project 1 participating agencies have technical and financial staff with experience in \nimplementing various externally financed projects. The finance department in each PIU claims \nthat, with additional training, guidelines, and manuals, their staff will be able to undertake their \ntasks and meet the deadlines set by Project 1.  \n \nB.  Budget, Funds Flow, and Reporting  \n5.  Project 1 will be financed by ADB loans, a grant from the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF), ADB-administered technical assistance (TA) grants, Government counterpart funds, and \ncontributions from beneficiaries. The ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan will finance \nonly civil works through international and/or national competitive bidding. No imprest account is \nrequired for the ADB OCR loan as funds will flow directly to contractors. An imprest account will \nbe opened with the EA for the Asian Development Fund loan to finance training, community \npreparation, workshops, studies, and other small items funded through Project 1. The GEF \ngrant will finance investment activities only for the Ministry of Forestry and needs an imprest \naccount which will be opened for financing small investments. The TA will finance additional \ncosts required for consultants, training, and other capacity building. The Government will pay to \nPIUs from its annual budgetary allocations for costs such as resettlement, local taxes, and other \nincremental costs.  \n                                                 \n1 A financial management assessment of each project will be prepared before finalizing its loan agreement. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n6.  Each PIU will prepare its owned reports on physical and financial progress, including the \nconsolidated financial statements of all financiers, and submit them to the PCMU quarterly and \nannually. The reporting system will have the capacity to link the financial information with the \nproject's physical progress. Controls will be in place to reduce the risk that the physical data \nmay not synchronize with the financial data. The financial management system is only partly \ncomputerized, but it can produce the necessary data for project financial reports. The reports \nwill be used by management for comparing actual expenditures with budgeted and programmed \nallocations. \n \nC.  Safeguard of Assets, Internal and External Audit, and Anticorruption \n \n7.  The RCMU, PCMU and PIUs are required to comply with the Government\u2019s accounting \nstandards.  They  will  adopt  uniform  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  documentation  of \ntransactions,  and  chart  of  accounts  that  allow  proper  recording  of  all  project  financial \ntransactions,  including  the  allocation  of  expenditure  to  the  respective  cost  components, \ndisbursement categories, and sources of funds. They will adopt adequate safeguards to protect \nassets from fraud, waste, and abuse, including by following ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date), particularly in respect of the sections of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n8.  Financial accounts and progress reports are to be audited quarterly by the inspectorate \ngeneral (the Government\u2019s internal audit) to ensure proper checks and balances and delegation \nof responsibilities. Internal reviews are conducted in compliance with the Government\u2019s policies, \nrules,  and  regulations.  Furthermore,  the  oversight  functions  of  the  National  Auditor  Office \n(Badan Pengawasan Keuangan and Pembangunan) will be adequate, as it will audit Project 1 \nannually. \n \n9.  The RCMU, PCMU, and PIUs will update their policy and procedures manual to guide \nactivities and ensure staff accountability as necessary in accordance with the changes required \nby  Government  and  ADB  practices.  A  procedure  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  only \nauthorized people can alter or establish a new accounting principle, policy, or procedure to be \nused by the RCMU, PCMU, and PIUs. The written policy and procedures cover all routine \nfinancial management and related administrative activities. \n \n10.   ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the representatives of the Government, including the EA and IAs. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the \nright to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to Project 1. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for Project \n1.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  Project  1  shall  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA; \nIAs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nProject 1.  \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \n \n11.  Based on the Government\u2019s policy and experience in fighting corruption, the following \npreventive measures, detailed in the project implementation guidelines,2 will be taken. Each IA \nwill establish a procurement committee. The EA and each IA will undertake and make available \nto ADB annual inspection audits from the National Audit Office. \n \n12.  Project 1 will train PIU members on appropriate procurement and financial management \nprocedures set forth in applicable provisions of ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s procurement, \naccounting, and auditing rules and regulations and the project\u2019s anticorruption policy. It will \nencourage  the  reporting  of  suspected  fraudulent  or  corrupt  practice  in  the  use  of  project \nresources  or  property.  Project  1  will  establish  financial  controls  through  periodic  review, \nreconciliation, and reporting of the status of fund releases, disbursements, and liquidation. All \ncommunity-based  activities  and  goods  procured  for  the  community  shall  be  announced  in \nadvance on village notice boards and through facilitated dialogue with the community. The \nPCMU will engage the services of a consultant with expertise in fiduciary arrangements and \ntechnical quality assurance who will review semiannually or as deemed necessary the project\u2019s \nphysical and financial quality-assurance performance. Project 1 will require strict documentation \nby its contractors on the use of project funds as the basis for further releases. To ensure \nadherence to contractual obligations and value-for-money principles, the office of the Ministry of \nPublic Works inspector general will, through routine inputs, build capacity in the PCMU to \nensure the implementation of sound procedures for quality control and quality assurance for civil \nworks and consulting services. \nD.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n13.  Based on the assessment and past experience of ADB working with the EA and IAs, the \ncurrent financial management arrangements are adequate for Project 1. However, financial and \naccounting  staff  needs  additional  training  to  strengthen  capacity  in  implementing  effective \naccounting and financial-management systems. Further assessment of the training needs for \neach agency will be identified as soon as the RCMU, PCMU, and PIUs are fully established. \nThis will ensure that Project 1 is effectively implemented and has sustainable development \nimpacts. The completed financial management assessment forms for the EA and the IAs are in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n                                                 \n2 A program administration manual, to be prepared by the EA and agreed by ADB prior to any procurement of \nservices, works, or goods, shall provide adequate detail on anticorruption and quality-control measures and quality-\nassurance procedures consistent with good governance, accountability, value for money, transparency, and \nresults-based outputs.  \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A12.1: Technical Assistance Outputs \nSection 1: Strengthening of Institutions, Policies, and \nStrategies for 6 Cis River Basin Territory  (continuation, Subcomponent B.2) \nSubcomponent A: Road map Institutional Strengthening  Quantification of water-related zoning on land-use in \nthe basin \nActivities aimed at improved coordination and communication \namong  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  Strategic assessment of the impacts of water-related \nstakeholders in the Citarum River basin (CRB)  zoning on other sectors \nStrengthening of road map coordination and management  Coordination  and  integration  of  the  many \nunit and regional planning agencies (BAPPEDA) in IWRM  implementing agencies and the section subprojects \nplanning and programming  of the Investment Program \nEstablishment of effective data and information systems to  Subcomponent B.3: Development of Key Policies \nsupport IWRM planning and programming  and Strategies for WRM \nCapacity building for improved national and regional IWRM  Develop policy for appropriate water pricing, water \nplanning and programming.  sharing, and balanced stakeholder participation. \nDevelop improved funding and more effective fiscal planning  Develop  strategies  and  options  for  industrial  and \nfor IWRM in basins in Indonesia  domestic  water  demand  management  and \nconservation. \nCapacity building to improve RCMU staff skills \nSubcomponent B.1: Institutional Strengthening for IWRM  Develop water entitlements and licensing systems. \nin 6 Cis River Basin Territory  Review water allocation policies and optimize water- \nActivities  to  improve  technical  capacity:  (i)  flood  warning  control  infrastructure  operation  in  key  sub-basins \nsystems and real-time communication, (ii) management and  and  for  the  operation  of  the  basin\u2019s  river  and \ndata systems, (iii) flow quantity and quality monitoring and  reservoir systems. \nregulation for efficient allocation  Section 2: Modeling and Decision Support \nSupport for Water Council and supporting office(s) and  System for Citarum River Basin \ncapacity building for water resource management agencies  Subcomponent C: Upper Citarum Basin Flood \nSupport ongoing activities where little or no capacity building  Management \nis required: (i) strategic planning, (ii) performance monitoring \nCompletion of current 1-dimensional river model \nand evaluation, (iii) develop basin strategic plans pola and \nstudies \nrencana (iv) water infrastructure operation and maintenance \nDevelop a 2-dimensional floodplain model.

Components in Project 1 \n \n1.  Project 1 of the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program \n(the Investment Program) includes five subprojects with physical works: (i) rehabilitation of the \nWest Tarum Canal for improved access to water, (ii) improved land and water management, (iii) \nsupport for community- and nongovernment organization (NGO)-driven initiatives for improved \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  (iv)  development  and  implementation  of  basin  river  quality \nimprovement  strategy  and  action  plans,  and  (v)  watershed  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), as well as activities supporting \ninstitutional strengthening and road map and program management. \n \n1.  Economic Benefits and Impacts of Project 1 \n2.  The main quantifiable benefits of Project 1 are those arising from the additional 19.6 \ncubic meters (m3) per second of water for Jakarta, Curug, and Beaks and the additional 4.5 m3 \nper second of water for paddy cultivation. The main impacts of Project 1 are (i) water supply \nfrom Jatiluhur and West Tarum Canal increased by 2.0% annually, (ii) water supply for Jakarta \nincreased by 2.5% annually, (iii) an additional 200,000 households in Jakarta provided with \npiped water annually, (iv) factories in the Jakarta area increasing their water usage by 2.0% \nannually, and (v) the annual economic growth rate for Jakarta and its vicinity increased by \n0.5%\u20131.0%. \n \n3.   The rehabilitation of West Tarum Canal will provide sufficient water to cultivate 117,600 \nhectares (ha) of paddy, as compared with 91,800 ha in the without-project situation, expanding \nthe annual cropped area of paddy by 25,800 ha by 2025. This will increase paddy cropping \nintensity from 1.53 to 1.93. A total of 25,800 farmers, each cultivating an average of 0.5 ha of \npaddy with two crops per year, will benefit from this increase in crop area. \n    \nB.  Financial and Economic Analyses \n     \n4.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken to evaluate the financial sustainability \nand economic viability of Project 1. These analyses were undertaken comparing the cost and \nbenefits in the case with and without Project 1. Financial analysis examines its sustainability \nfrom the beneficiaries\u2019 point of view, while economic analysis determines its viability from the \nsocial and economic perspective. The major project activities will be implemented over the \nperiod from 2009 to 2014. The economic life of Project 1 is assumed at 25 years, with the full \neconomic  benefits  realized  in  2027,  or  project  year  19.  Investment  costs,  including  all \nconsultancy, civil works, and equipment costs, are in constant 2008 prices. The exchange rate \nused is Rp9,300 to $1.00, which is the rate used by Government of Indonesia (the Government) \nin preparing its 2008 budget. The World Bank manufactures unit value index is used to adjust \nfuture commodity prices to constant 2008 prices. Forecast prices of traded commodities are \nbased on World Bank commodity price projections, while prices of other commodities are based \non prevailing local market prices. Prices for rice and phosphate and potassium fertilizer are \nbased on import parity, while those for nitrogenous fertilizer are at export parity. The 2015 \nforecast prices are used for deriving farm-gate commodity and fertilizer prices. \n \n5.  The standard conversion factor used in this analysis is 0.9, while that for labor is 0.8. \nThe price of labor is Rp25,000 per day, which is the prevailing rate in the project area. The \nconsiderable benefits of environmental improvements\u2014including improvements in water quality \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nand health and reductions in soil erosion and the risk of landslide and flooding\u2014are not included \nin the analysis because of difficulties in accurately quantifying them.  \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n \n6.  The two major project benefits that are considered for Project 1 are the additional water \nmade available for domestic, manufacturing, and industrial (DMI) uses and for paddy cultivation. \nThe main quantifiable benefits are those arising from the additional 19.6 m3 per second of water \nfor  Jakarta,  Curug,  and  Bekasi  and  the  additional  4.5  m3  per  second  of  water  for  paddy \ncultivation. \n \n7.  Some 10 m3 per second of water will be made available to meet the domestic needs of \n4.5 million additional residents of Jakarta and Bekasi in the next 15 years. The financial price of \nraw water sold to the Jakarta water utility (PAM Jaya) and other users is Rp87/m3. Raw water \ncharges are currently heavily underpriced, at less than 35% of operation and maintenance \ncosts. For the financial analysis, the average water tariff used is the current rate of Rp87/m3. As \ncompared with the without-project situation, Project 1 aims to increase the water available for \nirrigation by 4.5 m3 per second, for DMI by 19.6 m3 per second, and for flushing by 1.0 m3 per \nsecond, for a total of 25.1 m3 per second by 2025.  \n \n      a.   Benefits from Additional Water \n8.  The main financial benefits are income from the additional raw water supplied to DMI \nusers. The total annual benefits from this source will increase from Rp15,468 million in 2012 to \nRp63,934  million  in  2027.  Raw  water  for  DMI  use  provides  24%  of  total  project  financial \nbenefits. \n \n9.  The additional irrigation water will increase the cropped paddy area by 8,580 ha in 2010 \nand by 25,800 ha in 2025. Based on an estimated paddy crop budget, the economic benefit \nfrom cultivating 1 ha of paddy is estimated at Rp9.80 million. The total financial benefits from \ncultivating this increased area will rise from Rp175,154 million in 2015 to Rp224,295 million in \n2025. In the without-project situation, the farmer is expected to grow an additional dry-land crop, \nmainly maize, if water is unavailable to cultivate paddy. The dry-land crop area is expected to \nincrease by 1,420 ha in 2010 and by 12,300 ha in 2025. The net return from this crop is \nestimated at Rp6.70 million/ha and the net loss is valued at Rp9,516 million in 2010, rising to \nRp52,400  million  in  2025.  The  net  gain  from  the  increase  in  irrigation  water  is  valued  at \nRp69,000 million in 2010 to Rp82,424 million in 2025. This benefit represents about three \nquarters of the project financial benefits. \n \nb.    Project Financial Analysis \n \n10.  The project financial internal rate of return is 16.4%. Its sensitivities were examined for \n(i) changes in project cost (10% higher), (ii) revenue (10% lower), and both. The results of this \nanalysis show that the project is still viable under these all these unfavorable situations. \n \n      2.  Economic Analysis \n \n11.   In the economic analysis, the marginal value product of the additional water for DMI and \nfor irrigation was used to value irrigation water. The average value of the marginal value product \nof irrigation water is estimated at Rp1,089/m3, based on a previously conducted study. This \napproach places a value on the additional irrigation water that will be supplied by the project. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \n12.  Project  1  will  supply  raw  water  to  DMI  users  in  urban  centers.  Raw  water  is  an \nintermediate product, while the water tariff rates are set for treated piped water supply. There is \nno free-market price for raw water, and its value has to be computed based on willingness to \npay for the final product. The cost of producing raw water and treated water, the latter including \nthe cost of raw water, was estimated using available data. Then proportion of the cost of \nproducing the raw water was used to estimate the price of the raw water. The estimation shows \nthat  about  8.75%  of  the  total  cost  of  producing  treated  water,  including  both  capital  and \nrecurrent costs, can be attributed to the cost of raw water. Based on the available information \nfrom a recent willingness-to-pay study of consumers, tariffs for treated water was taken as \nRp8,000/m3. Using the cost proportion, the price for raw water is set at Rp700/m3. This value of \nRp700/m3 was used as the benefit of raw water used in the project economic analysis. \n \n3.  Project Economic Analysis \n \n13.  Irrigation benefits will account for only 15% of the project economic benefit, with the sale \nof raw water accounting for the balance of 85%. The project estimated internal rate of return is \n27.8%. Its sensitivities were examined for (i) lowering irrigation benefits by 25%, (ii) lowering \nirrigation benefits by 50%, (iii) lowering raw water charges by 25%, (iv) lowering raw water \ncharges by 50%, (v) a combination of lowering irrigation benefits by 25% and lowering raw \nwater charges by 25%, and (vi) a combination of lowering irrigation benefits by 50% and \nlowering raw water charges by 50%. The results of this analysis show that the project is still \nviable under these all these unfavorable situations. \n \n14.  Switching values of the main project variables indicates that the project will remain \neconomically viable at an estimated internal rate of return of 12.0%, even if one of these \nimportant variables are changed by (i) raising the project cost by 220%; (ii) reducing incremental \nbenefits by 70%, (iii) reducing the proposed water tariff by 90%, and (iv) reducing the irrigation \ntariff by 99%. \n \n15.  The nominal weighted average cost of capital is 7.0%, which is considerably lower than \nthe project financial internal rate of return of 16.4 %.  \n \n16.  The poverty impact ratio, which is a measure of the net economic benefits to the poor, is \n19.4%. A total of 46,000 paddy farmers, each with an average holding of 0.5 ha, will benefit \nfrom Project 1. Some 26,000 farmers will benefit from having irrigation that will enable them to \nplant paddy on their holdings instead of their current practice of cultivating a dry-land crop. \nAnother 3,000 farmers will benefit from the land and water management program, which will \nraise their paddy yield from the existing 5.5 tons/ha to 8.0 tons/ha. With the project, paddy \nfarmer and community net income will be raised by 38%, reducing the poverty incidence from \nthe current 25% to less than 15%.

Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program \n \nSoutheast Asia \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nMultitranche Financing Facility  Department/Agriculture Environment \nModality:  Division: \nand Natural Resources Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY  \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for the period 2006 \u2013 2009 is to help the Government achieve higher levels of pro-\npoor sustainable growth and to enhance social development. The water resources of the rivers and groundwater systems in the \nCitarum River basin are critical to social and economic development of the country. The Citarum River Basin is the most strategic \nriver basin in the country. The Basin is located in the province of West Java and made up of 11 districts and 4 municipalities, \ncovering an area of about 13,000 km\u00b2 and with a population of about 28 million people in 2004. Located in the Basin are major \nindustrial centers including Indonesia\u2019s fourth biggest city, Bandung, and satellite industrial parks to the east of Jakarta. The \nCitarum River supplies some 80% of Jakarta\u2019s raw water and is the site of 3 major dams and 3 large multipurpose reservoirs, \nwhich are essential for industries. The Basin has 7 protected areas that are quintessentially important representatives of the West \nJava Montane Forest Type - which is a rapidly diminishing unique plant and animal assemblage restricted to West Java. The \nInvestment Program will aim at improving living standards and health in the Citarum River Basin. The proposed Project 1 outputs \nare: (i) Institutional Strengthening of IWRM; (ii) Water Supply Options and Improved Groundwater Management for Bandung; (iii) \nRehabilitation of West Tarum Canal; (iv) Improved land and water management; (v) Support for Community and NGO-drive \nInitiatives for Water Supply and Sanitation; (vi) Development and Implementation of a Basin River Quality Improvement Strategy \nand Action Plans; (vii) Catchment Management and Biodiversity Conservation Project; and (viii) Project Management. It is in line \nwith the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) for 2005-2009, which targets reducing poverty headcount rate \nfrom 18.2% in 2002 to 8.2% by 2009 through higher growth rates with job creation and environmental sustainability, and activities \nand investments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention no longer \nrequire project level poverty assessments. Nonetheless, an initial social assessment was carried out during the Investment \nProgram preparation. The poverty incidence in the Citarum Basin is 9.6%, with 2 out of 11 districts recording higher poverty levels \nthan the national average of 16.7% in 2004. However the poverty rates are in the range of 1.5%\u20134.8% in the municipalities and \n2.9%\u201326.4% in the districts, the project poverty impact ratio (PPIR) of Project 1 is 26.8%. Many who may not be income poor \ncould be classified as poor on the basis of their lack of access to basic services and poor human development outcomes. \nIndonesia lags behind other countries in the region in some MDG-related indicators and the situation in Citarum Basis in no \nexception. In particular, access to safe water and sanitation, particularly among the poor, is a crucial problem. In the Citarum \nBasin, 40% of households have access to septic tanks, which is just above the national level of 39%, and 42% of households \nhave access to clean water, which is below the national average of 49% (SUSENAS, 2004). Only 51% among the poor have the \naccess to safe water and 41% of the poor do not have access to own or shared toilet facilities.  \nII.

The rehabilitation of the West Tarum Canal (WTC) is a subproject \nof the proposed Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program (the \nInvestment Program) to be carried out by the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) \nas Executing Agency (EA). The Investment Program will be implemented in tranches using the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) multitranche financing facility (MFF) over a planned period of \n15 years and will cover the entire Citarum River basin, or a total of 10 districts or regencies plus \nsix municipalities in the province of West Java. Following a series of workshops with various \nstakeholders  in  August  and  October  2006,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  WTC  was  included  in \nProject 1.  \n2.  The WTC is 68.3 kilometers (km) long, of which Project 1 will rehabilitate 54.2 km. The \nWTC has a 100 meter right-of-way, measured as 50 meters on either side from the center of the \ncanal. The main objective of the rehabilitation of the WTC is to improve the flow and quality of \nthe water that fills 80% of Jakarta\u2019s surface water needs, in addition to supplying the water \nrequirements of industrial establishments and about 56,000 ha of farmland. The WTC runs \nthrough three districts: Kabupaten Karawang, Kabupaten Bekasi, and Kota Bekasi. \n3.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. The updated inventory of \nlosses undertaken by technical assistance (TA) consultants1 in May 2008 calculated that 892 \nentitled parties, including 872 affected households and 20 government agencies, will lose the \nuse of approximately 46 hectares of land that will be cleared of structures and vegetation. None \nof the occupants of affected land have any legal claim over the affected property, as it is within \nthe established right-of-way of the WTC. Impacts are summarized as follows:  \n \n(i)  marginal impacts on permanent use of paddy land for 209 farmers; \n(ii)  temporary loss of productive land in former riverbeds for 150 households;  \n(iii)  the relocation of 49 households who have other land to move to;  \n(iv)  the relocation of 466 households who have no other land;  \n(v)  loss of income as canal boat operators for nine households; \n(vi)  impacts on 589 poor and vulnerable households; and \n(vii)  loss of 542 main structures. \n4.  The land in former river beds may be reused after about a year following the disposal of \ndredged material assessed for any contamination and certified as safe for use.  \n5.  The  key  legal  instrument  currently  in  force  in  Indonesia  that  is  most  relevant  to \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  Presidential  Decree  No.  36/2005,  as  amended  by  Presidential \nDecree No. 65/2006, entitled On Land Acquisition for Development Purposes in the Public \nInterest,  and  BPN  Regulation  No.  3/2007,  Land  Acquisition  Implementation  Guideline  of \nPresidential Decrees No. 36/2005 and 65/2006. Superseding Presidential Decree No. 36/2005, \nwhich  earlier  amended  Presidential  Decree  No.  55/1993,  the  2005  and  2006  presidential \ndecrees  provide  for  various  forms  of  compensation  for  private  assets  needed  to  pursue \nGovernment development projects. The aforementioned laws, including their enabling decrees, \nhave been conceptualized primarily for acquiring in the most expeditious way properties needed \nfor the right-of-way of government projects. They were not intended to address the social \nconsequences of the exercise by the state of its power of eminent domain, collectively referred \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Preparing the Integrated Citarum Water \nResources Project. Manila. (TA 4381-INO). ", "  Appendix 15  63 \n \n \nto involuntary resettlement. This is why, for the Investment Program and all its subprojects and \nsubcomponents, the policy framework in the resettlement plan for this subproject has been \nadopted, to fill in any gaps regarding what local laws and regulations2 cannot provide to ensure \nthat affected household are rehabilitated to at least their pre-project condition.  \n6.  Project Entitlements. One key policy objective of the resettlement plan is to replace and \ncompensate  lost  assets  based  on  the  principle  of  replacement  cost  and  in  line  with  local \ngovernment  regulations,  if  available.  Replacement  cost  is  the  amount  calculated  before \ndisplacement that is needed to replace affected assets. Additional socioeconomic support will be \nprovided  to  affected  households  depending  on  the  type  and  severity  of  their  losses  and \nconsistent with the intention of helping to mitigate impacts and to restore livelihood and living \nstandards. Where Government assistance is not sufficient to replace lost land or other assets, \nthe  project  will  provide  an  additional  special  program  under  livelihood-restoration  program \nsupport  to  raise  the  entitlement  to  replacement  cost.  The  project  will  provide  transitional \nsubsistence assistance to households displaced from their sources of productive income or from \nhousing during the transition period until they can reestablish productive income, businesses, or \nhouses at new locations. The subsistence assistance and transportation allowances are in the \nform  of  a  program  of  livelihood  restoration.  The  project  will  provide  support  to  displaced \nhouseholds to transport their personal possessions and new and used building materials. The \ndetails of these additional socioeconomic support allowances are provided in the entitlement \nmatrix. Households that are physically displaced and/or affected by the loss of 10% or more of \ntheir productive assets, or who are vulnerable, will be entitled to participate in the livelihood-\nrestoration program, which may be made available to poor households and/or individuals living \nin the villages along the WTC. The estimated cost of WTC resettlement is $2.0 million. \n7.  Ethnicity,  Vulnerability,  and  Gender  Issues.  The  census  of  affected  households \nidentified 40 who are migrants from the island of Madura. While they are in most ways similar to \nthe Sundanese majority, they tend to live in cluster and would rather avoid public meetings with \nSundanese present. The project will therefore set up mechanisms to ensure that the Madurese \nare provided the same opportunity to participate in WTC rehabilitation. Likewise, the census has \nidentified 589 vulnerable households: 91 headed by women, 440 living below the officially set \npoverty  threshold,  and  58  elderly.  The  specific  needs  and  concerns  of  these  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be considered, and they will be assisted to improve their socioeconomic status.  \n8.  Participation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure. Prior to the commencement of the \ninventory of losses in September and October 2006, and again in April and May 2007 and May \n2008 as part of follow-up activities on data gathering in connection with the preparation of the \nresettlement plan, public meetings and consultations with local officials, residents, and affected \nhouseholds were held in villages traversed by the WTC. Consultation meetings with affected \nhouseholds  and  local  officials  will  continue  during  resettlement  plan  updating  and \nimplementation and will follow the project\u2019s participatory approach. A public information booklet \nin the local language has been distributed to affected households and posted in commune \noffices in villages and subdistricts. A copy of the resettlement plan in the local language has \nbeen placed in project implementation unit (PIU) and district offices. A grievance mechanism \nhas been designed to ensure that affected households\u2019 concerns and complaints are addressed \nand resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. The project authority will continue to make \n                                                 \n2 At the time of the inventory of losses, only Kabupaten Bekasi had any specific decision letters or local legislation \nrelating to resettlement along the WTC: April 2007 Keputusan Bupati Bekasi Nomor 300/Kep.71-POD.

Implementation  Arrangements.  The  DGWR  is  the  EA  and  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for ensuring the satisfactory planning and implementation of Project 1. The PIU in \nBalai Besar Wilayah Sungai Citarum and the district resettlement working group (RWG) will be \nresponsible in the planning, updating, and implementing the resettlement program. The PIU will \nhave qualified resettlement and social development staff who will assist the PIU in the RWG. \nLocal governments through the office of the regent or mayor, will provide the main workforce by \norganizing  the  RWG,  issuing  decrees  and  approving  disbursing  funds.  The  entitlement \narrangements, based on both the entitlement matrix and existing local government regulations, \nare described as follows: (i) affected households in Karawang District and Bekasi city are \nentitled to replacement cost as described in the entitlement matrix and calculated based local \nregulations  where  available;  (ii)  affected  households  in  Bekasi  District  will  be  entitled  to \ncompensation using the uang kerohiman scheme as stipulated in the existing local government \nregulation  Keputusan  Bupati  Bekasi  Nomor  300/Kep.71-POD.  I/2007,  or  any  updated  local \ngovernment regulation; (iii) any gaps in the Bekasi District regulation on providing compensation \nwill be filled with a special program under the livelihood restoration program; (iv) all kinds of \nallowance defined in the entitlement matrix will be provided through the livelihood restoration \nprogram; and (v) the monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities should refer to the \nimplementation  approach  defined  above.  The  investment  program  coordination  and \nmanagement  unit  will  guide  and  assist  the  PIU  and  the  RWG  in  resettlement  program \nimplementation. The PIU will engage local organizations and NGOs to design and implement \nrelocation and livelihood relocation activities and monitor livelihood restoration. \n10.  Monitoring. The PIU and the RWG will be responsible for the internal monitoring of \nresettlement  activities.  Progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  quarterly.  An  external \nmonitoring and evaluation agency will be engaged 1 month following the start of resettlement \nprogram updating. This agency will be required to submit an inception report 1 month following its \nmobilization  and  quarterly  reports  on  the  progress  of  resettlement  program  updating  and \nimplementation  and  to  make  necessary  recommendations  to  address  issues  that  will  be \nidentified. The agency will conduct a post-resettlement implementation evaluation study. \n11.  Implementation Schedule. During completion of detailed design in 2009, resettlement \nactivities will be coordinated with the schedule of civil works. Land acquisition and the relocation \nof affected households cannot commence until the updated resettlement program has been \nreviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  The  acquisition  of  assets,  payment  of  compensation, \nresettlement,  and  start  of  livelihood-rehabilitation  activities  will  be  completed  prior  to  any \nconstruction taking place in a designated construction works zone.3 \n12.  Disclosure  of  Resettlement  Program  and  Social  Monitoring  Reports.  The  draft \nresettlement program was uploaded to the ADB website before appraisal. The final plan has \nbeen disclosed to affected households and uploaded to the ADB website. An updated plan will \nbe prepared during the detailed design and will likewise be disclosed to affected households and \nuploaded to the ADB website. Social monitoring reports will be made available to affected \nhouseholds and submitted to ADB for posting on the web.  \n                                                 \n3  Zones shall be a designated during detailed design and clearly identified in the resettlement plan update that will \ndivide the WTC into convenient stretches for construction. Affected households will be resettled from zones in a \nsystematic way to optimize the implementation of the project while paying due consideration to their rights. Notice \nto proceed with civil works for a whole zone will be issued only after resettlement program activities are complete. \n ", "  Appendix 16  65 \n \n \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources  Management  Investment  Program  (the \nInvestment Program) is designed to address the multiple concerns of water supply sustainability \nand water quality degradation in the Citarum River basin, which supplies 80% of Jakarta\u2019s water \nneeds.  Inadequate  institutional  arrangements,  deteriorating  infrastructure,  competing  water \ndemands, and rapid urban and industrial growth have caused water supply shortages and \nunhealthy environmental conditions throughout the basin. This summary initial environmental \nexamination is the environmental assessment for Project 1 priority subprojects funded by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under the Investment Program. \nB.  Project 1 Description \n2.  Project 1 subprojects include (i) water supply options for Bandung, (ii) the rehabilitation \nof the West Tarum Canal, (iii) the development of a basin river quality improvement strategy and \naction plans, (iv) watershed management and biodiversity conservation, (v) land and water \nmanagement, (vi) support for community- and NGO-driven initiatives for improved water supply \nand  sanitation,  (vii)  institutional  strengthening  for  integrated  water  resources  management \n(IWRM), and (viii) program management. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n  1.  Physical Setting and Land Use \n3.  The program area, located on Java Island and covering 13,000 square kilometers (km2), \nis a cluster of river basins consisting of (i) the 6,600 km2 Citarum River basin, which straddles \nthe central part of the program area and flows from south to north into the Java Sea; (ii) the \n4,400 km2 cluster of small basins whose drainage areas are connected to the Citarum River \nsystem through the East Tarum Canal; and (iii) the Cikarang and Bekasi rivers, with a combined \ndrainage area of 2,000 km2, which are also connected with the Citarum River through the West \nTarum Canal. Together, these interconnected river basins make up the Citarum River Basin \nTerritory, the program area. The area is a key rice producer for the country, with 390,000 \nhectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  rice  paddies,  240,000  ha  of  which  are  served  by  the  Jatiluhur \nReservoir1 and canal system in the lower basin. Land devoted to rice production makes up \nnearly half (47.5%) of the program area, with 70% of it fully irrigated. Rain-fed areas cover \n43,000 ha, or only about 10% of the land used. Also in the program area are three large dams \nthat generate a total of 1,400 megawatts and major industries centered at Bandung and the \nrapidly  urbanizing corridor  of  Bekasi\u2013Cikarang,  east of Jakarta.  Forest  areas  in  the  upper \nCitarum have shrunk from 35,000 ha in 1992 to 19,000 ha in 2001. Remaining forests cover \nonly 10.2% of the program area.  \n \n2.  Water Resources \n \n4.  The three cascading reservoirs (Saguling, Cirata, and Jatiluhur,) were built to regulate \nflows, provide hydropower, and store and supply water for irrigation, industrial, and domestic \nuses. They also trap sediments. In Bandung, an estimated 90% of the population and 98% of \n                                                 \n1 Also sometimes referred to as the Juanda Reservoir. \n \n ", "66   Appendix 16   \nindustries rely on groundwater. The water table has declined by 5 meters per year in some \nareas. Since 1920, the cumulative drop in the water table has been approximately 85 meters. \nThe ratio of the volume of wet season peak flows to dry season low flows in the upper basin has \nincreased  from  3.4  in  1992  to  7.3  in  2003.  Worsened  flood  frequency  and  severity  are \nassociated with destructive landslides and mud flows. On its route to Jakarta, the West Tarum \nCanal intersects the Bekasi River, which drains a rapidly developing urban area and is heavily \npolluted by untreated household sewage, industrial wastewater, and solid waste dumped along \nthe riverbanks.  \n \n3.  Ecological Resources \n \n5.  Remaining forests cover only 10.2% of the program area\u2014100,600 ha of primary forest \nand 34,800 ha of secondary forest\u2014far less than the 30% mandated in the 1999 national \nforestry  law.  Much  of  the  remaining  forest  area  is  fragmented,  a  condition  that  threatens \necosystem  viability  and  makes  these  areas  vulnerable  to  continuing  encroachment  and \nconversion for upland farming. Two national parks are located in the upper part of the basin: \nGunung Gede Pangrango (15,000 ha) and Gunung Halimum (40,000 ha). Both are classified by \nthe International Union for Conservation of Nature as category II, to be managed for ecosystem \nprotection  and  recreation.  The  West  Java  Environment  Protection  Agency  of  the  Citarum \nindicated a decline in macro benthic faunal diversity that correlated statistically with many of the \nwater pollution indicators. There are no significant coral reefs and sea grasses off the Java Sea \ncoast of the Citarum River system. However, there are mangrove areas that, together with the \nthree artificial reservoirs, make up the wetland ecosystem of the basin. \n \n4.  Socioeconomic Conditions \n \n6.  The program area covers 11 districts and 4 cities. The population in 2004 was 28 million, \nwith 4.1 million households: 30% derived livelihood from agriculture, 25% from industry, and \n45% from services. The dynamism of the region\u2019s economy is shown by 2003 data indicating \nthat  the  growth  rate  of  West  Java  Province\u2019s  gross  regional  domestic  product,  at  4.97%, \noutperforming that of Jakarta, at 4.39%. Poverty is nevertheless still pervasive in the basin, with \ndifferent districts in the basin showing poverty rates of 5% to 26%.  \n \nD.   Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts of Project 1 \n \n7.  Institutional  Strengthening  for  IWRM.  This  component  will,  through  various \ninstitutional interventions, pave the way for improved overall capacity to manage both water and \nenvironmental quality in the basin. The environmental impact of this activity is considered \npositive. \n8.  Water Supply Options and Improved Groundwater Management for Bandung. The \ndevelopment of options for water supply to Bandung is in itself an environmental amelioration \nmeasure  that  is  expected  to  have  a  long-term  positive  impact  on  the  recovery  of  the \ngroundwater  resource,  which  is  currently  being  pumped  at  unsustainable  levels.  This  is  a \nplanning activity with no direct adverse impacts but potential positive long-term environmental \nimpact. \n \n9.  Rehabilitation of West Tarum Canal. Any adverse impacts from dredging (e.g., the \ndispersion and disposal of bottom sediments) will be mitigated by (i) testing of bottom sediments \n ", "  Appendix 16  67 \n \n \nprior to dredging and, if contaminants are present, using double silt traps to prevent dispersion; \n(ii) dewatering dredging spoils before transport to spoil banks; (iii) developing former riverbed \ndisposal sites for the soft sediments into nurseries to supply seedlings for reforestation or urban \ngreening; (iv) fencing former riverbed disposal areas and providing them with drainage and \nembankments to prevent flooding and the washout of deposited sediments; (v) using coarse \nsediments as a base material for roads and fill material for general construction; (vi) informing \nresidents in the immediate vicinity of the dredging sites of the activities and about any temporary \nnuisance issues like odor; (vii) requiring the contractor to prepare a spoil-disposal and nuisance-\nminimization plan; and (viii) providing alternative sources of water, as needed, to communities \nalong the canal that draw water from the stream or use it for washing or bathing. \n \n10.  Land and Water Management. The use of organic fertilizer will be promoted because it \nis  essential  for  improving  soil  structure  to  maximize  benefits  from  the  system  of  rice \nintensification. Reduced usage of chemical fertilizers will lessen the threat of contaminating \nwater bodies. However, it is uncertain whether water management enhancement will increase \nfertilizer and pesticide use compared to present practice of continuously flooding paddy fields. \nSo,  alternatives  to  exclusively  chemical  pest  and  weed  control  will  be  promoted,  such  as \nintegrated pest management. \n \n11.  Community-Driven Initiatives for Improved Water and Catchment Management. \nThe  construction  of  communal  sanitation  facilities  and  garbage-collection  facilities  may \ntemporarily cause local traffic disruption and nuisance, which will be mitigated through public \nnotifications and construction best practices. Septic tanks will have sealed bottoms and will not \nbe constructed closer than 15 meters from wells and creeks used for water supply. These \nactivities will improve river water quality and reduce health risks \n \n12.  Basin  Water  Quality  Improvement  Strategy  and  Action  Plans.  The  positive \nenvironmental impact of this planning component, though indirect, is highly significant and long \nlasting in terms of reducing water pollution threats from various sources.  \n \n13.  Productive Reforestation and Biodiversity Protection. Biodiversity protection will, as \npart of the watershed management in the upper basin, help protect endangered flora and fauna \nand improve surface water quality and quantity in a sustainable manner.  \n \n2.  Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Citarum River Basin \n \n14.  A basin-wide strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was carried out to establish a \ntiered approach to environmental assessment and planning. The SEA examined the impacts of \nprojects under each investment program tranche to ensure consistency with the basin-wide \nassessment framework and compliance with ADB and Government environmental assessment \nrequirements for individual projects. The initial environmental assessment (IEE) for Project 1 \nwas carried out as part of the SEA. \n \nE.   Monitoring and Institutional Arrangements \n \n1.  Monitoring Parameters and Responsibilities \n \n15.  The contractor shall be required to submit a construction plan incorporating adequate \nsafeguards,  particularly  for  handling  and  disposing  of  dredged  sediments.  The  monthly \nmonitoring of conventional water quality parameters on excavation and construction sites shall \nbe  done  by  Perum  Jasa  Tirta  2,  which  shall  provide  monthly  reports  to  the  project \n ", "68   Appendix 16   \nimplementation unit (PIU). The PIU will require the contractor to take any corrective actions \ncalled for in these reports.  \n \n16.  The PIU shall monitor water turbidity, which may be affected by construction. The PIU \nshall  use  local  community  health  data  to  implement  corrective  actions  and  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of the environmental management plan.  \n \n17.  Prior to excavation, sediments shall be tested for the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, \nchromium, lead, mercury, and zinc and other contaminants and fecal coliform to determine the \nsuitable method of disposal as guided by IEE criteria.  \n \n18.  Odors, noise, traffic congestion on service roads, community complaints, etc., will be \nmonitored at construction and dredging sites. \n \n2.  Institutional Arrangements \n19.  The  Balai  Besar  and  PIU  environment  management  office  will  be  responsible  for \nidentifying specific Government environmental procedures (AMDAL),  environmental regulations \nand ADB requirements for each project, such as exemption status or type of assessment \nrequired, including the public consultation and mandated review steps.  \nF.    Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n20.  As a result of stakeholder consultations during the preparation of Project 1, concerns \nregarding the rights of water users in the lower basin and the need to shift focus from physical \nengineering issues to institutional development issues, resulted in changing the project mode to \na program approach in terms of gradually improving the environment of the basin. The program \npackage took the form of a road map with significant emphasis on environmental issues guided \nby shared program objectives among multiple stakeholders in the basin. \n \nG.    Findings and Recommendations \n \n21.  Project  1  is  expected  to  generate  significant  environmental  benefits  by  ensuring \nadequate  and  equitable  water  supply,  water  quality  improvement,  the  rehabilitation  of \nwatersheds,  improvement  in  institutional  capacity,  and  the  protection  of  basin  ecosystem \nfunctions,  including  biodiversity.  None  of  the  damaging  impacts  identified  were  considered \nsignificant, and no further study is needed beyond what was conducted under the IEE and the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF). \n \nH.   Conclusion \n \n22.  For the purposes of compliance with ADB environmental assessment guidelines, no \nadditional study or full environmental impact assessment is needed on potential environmental \nimpacts of Project 1. However, individual projects with potential adverse impacts, specifically \nWest Tarum Canal rehabilitation and the construction of communal septic tanks, will follow the \ntemplate for environmental management and monitoring plan of the IEE prepared for Project 1 \nand the procedures, criteria, and guidelines specified under the EARF, to comply with ADB and \nGovernment environmental assessment requirements. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081112145834+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081208153249+08'00'", "Title": "Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program"}, "author_page": "GLOSSARY  \n \nintegrated water resources  \u2013  IWRM  is  now  recognized  around  the  world  as  the  process  to \nmanagement  promote the coordinated development and management of water, \nland and related resources in river basins to maximize the economic \nbenefits  and  social  welfare  in  an  equitable  manner  without \ncompromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.
