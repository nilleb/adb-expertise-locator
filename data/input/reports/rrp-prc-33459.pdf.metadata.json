An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, \nand the summary  was circulated to the Board and  made public \nthrough the web site of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 27 \nMay 2003. \n \nProject Description  The Project is located in Xi\u2019an municipality, the capital of Shaanxi \nProvince and a key growth pole in the poor western region of the \nPRC. In Xi\u2019an, the urban population increased from 2.3 million \n(37.3% of total) in 1990 to 3.0 million (42.7%) in 2002. Rapid \nurbanization  in  Xi\u2019an has put pressure on the urban transport \nsystem, resulting in traffic congestion and increasing motor vehicle \nemission. The Project will support the Government\u2019s development \nstrategy by improving the urban transport system by (i) constructing \nan urban ring road; (ii) improving  connector roads; (iii) providing \nurban transport facilities and services; and (iv) providing consulting \nservices and training to enhance construction quality, road safety, \nvehicle emission control, and project monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nRationale  Consistent  with  the  Xi\u2019an  master  plan,  large  investments  are \nprogrammed for road construction, a subway system, and public \ntransport operations. Clear and realistic priorities need to be set for \nfuture  urban  development.  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  are \nneeded in urban transport policy and regulations, public transport, \ntraffic management and safety, road maintenance, vehicle emission \ncontrol,  driver  education,  urban  poverty  reduction,  and  private \nsector  development.  The  master  plan  gives  priority  to  the \nconstruction of the third ring road, which will form the main physical \ncomponent  of  the  Project.  Construction  of  a  ring  road  and \nconnector roads will provide efficient and safe access within the \ncity, and for inbound and outbound traffic. The Project will address \nthe  growing  traffic  congestion  caused  by  the  rapid  increase  in \ntraffic, inadequate road infrastructure, and poor traffic management. \nThe Project has been designed as a public service project because \npeople in the urban area will all benefit from the Project directly or \nindirectly through reduced congestion in the urban road network as \na whole. The project road users, therefore, will not be directly \ncharged for its use. Xi\u2019an municipality has identified the Project as a \npriority investment, which will also complement ADB\u2019s assistance in \ndeveloping the Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan section of the national trunk highway \nsystem. \n \nObjectives   The  principal  objective  of  the  Project is to  promote  economic \ngrowth in Xi\u2019an by reducing transport costs and relieving transport \ninfrastructure  bottlenecks.  The  Project  will  help  develop  an \nefficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable urban transport \n ", "iv   \nsystem by (i) strengthening institutional capacity through improved \ncoordination among municipal government agencies; (ii) improving \ntraffic management and safety, (iii)  improving vehicle emission \ncontrol,  and  (iv)  increasing  the  capacity  of  urban  roads.  The \nProject comprises the following components: (i) constructing a 71-\nkilometer (km) ring road, including interchanges and bridges; (ii) \nupgrading and constructing 16 km of connector roads to integrate \nthe ring road with the overall urban road network; (iii) improving \nfive  areas  of  urban  transport\u2014traffic  management  and  safety, \nvehicle emission control, public transport, urban transport planning, \nand  road  maintenance;  (iv)  procuring  equipment  for  road \nmaintenance, transport planning modeling, traffic signals and area \ntraffic  control  center,  vehicle  emission  inspection,  vehicle axle \nweighing system, compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations, \nand surveillance and communications; (v) land acquisition and \nresettlement;  and  (vi)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision,  urban  transport  component,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and capacity building. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $762 million equivalent, comprising \n$296  million  (39%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $466  million \nequivalent (61%) in local currency. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \n    Source \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n    Asian Development Bank   270  0  270 \n    Xi\u2019an Municipal Government  26  466  492 \n    Total  296  466  762 \n%  39  61  100 \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n     \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $270 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years \nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% \n(the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by  the  Government \nTerms  to the Shaanxi provincial government (SPG), which will relend to \nXi\u2019an  municipal  government  (XMG)  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan.  XMG will further onlend to \nthe  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Third  Ring  Road  Construction  and \nDevelopment Company  (Project Company) on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB loan. XMG will bear the \ninterest rate variation and foreign exchange risks of the loan. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \n \n ", "    v\n \nEstimated Project   31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date   \n \nImplementation  The Project Company will  implement   the  Project. Implementation  \nArrangements  of  the  urban  transport  component  will  be  coordinated  with  the \nrelevant municipal agencies under a leading group chaired by the \nmayor. \n \nExecuting Agency  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  Commission \n(XMURCC), XMG \n \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works for \nthe project roads will be procured through international competitive \nbidding.  On  22  July  2003,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for \nprocuring  civil  works.  Equipment  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding or international shopping. \n \nConsulting Services  About 51 person-months of international consulting services will \nbe  provided  to  (i)  support  project  management  during  the \nconstruction period; (ii) conduct a safety audit of the project design \nand completed construction works; (iii) help set up and implement \nquality control procedures; (iv) develop capacity in road safety and \nvehicle emissions, and prepare action plans for Xi\u2019an municipality; \n(v) prepare  a procedural manual for good management of  the \nProject  Company;  (vi)  assist  in  formulating  a  capacity \ndevelopment program; (vii) carry out environmental monitoring; \nand (viii)  help  establish  and  implement  a  project  performance \nmanagement system, including assessing the impact on poverty \nreduction.  About  3,000  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  required  for  construction  supervision.  The \ninternational consultants will be financed from the ADB loan and \nrecruited based on the quality- and cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe domestic consultants will be financed by the Project Company \nand will be recruited in accordance with government procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits and   By  improving  urban  transport  facilities  and   traffic  management,   \nBeneficiaries  the Project will help establish an efficient, safe, and environmentally \nsustainable urban transport system in Xi\u2019an municipality. This will \nhelp  promote  investments,  enhance  incomes,  and  create \nemployment opportunities. The economic internal rate of return is \nestimated at 15.4%. About 3 million people live in the project area: \n1.9 million in the urban area, and 1.1 million in rural areas. The \nlow-income population includes 4.2% of urban residents earning \nless than  CNY3,000 per capita per annum and 8.0% of rural \nresidents earning less than CNY1,000 per capita per annum. The \nProject\u2019s  direct  impacts  include  construction  employment \nopportunities,  savings  in  travel  time,  and  cost  savings  in \npassenger  transport. Indirect benefits  include  accelerating  the \nurbanization process, which provides the potential for households \n ", "vi   \nto diversify and increase employment opportunities and incomes. \nHousehold  poverty  and  vulnerability  are  reduced  with  multiple \nincome earners. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been  formulated to reduce potential technical, \neconomic, financial, and social risks. The main potential risks, \nwhich could result in implementation delays and cost overruns, \nare associated with the  unexplored archeological sites that may \nbe discovered during excavation, given the historical nature of the \nproject area.  To mitigate the risks,  a special advisory team will \ntake  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  XMURCC  has  proven \nexperience in dealing with this situation. Given the magnitude and \ncomplexity of land acquisition and displacement of houses and \nenterprises, there are potential risks that  land acquisition may \ndelay construction activities or that resettlement implementation \nmay  not  fully  restore  all  livelihoods.  These  risks  have  been \nmitigated by a carefully prepared detailed implementation plan, \ncompensation standards, budget, and schedule managed by the \nProject Company\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement department \nand monitored by an independent institute. \n ", " ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  (RRP)  on  a \nproposed loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth has been accompanied by urbanization, with the urban \npopulation increasing from 300 million (26.4% of total) in 1990 to 502 million (39.1%) in 2001. \nThis urbanization trend is forecast to continue, with the urban population reaching 832 million \n(54.5%) in 2025. Increased incomes and prosperity have made cars affordable to a growing \nsegment  of  the  population,  the  emerging  middle  class.  Vehicle  ownership  is  projected  to \nincrease from 18 per 1,000 people in 2000 by a factor of more than five in 2020. In  Xi\u2019an \nmunicipality the urban population increased from 2.3 million (37.3% of total) in 1990 to 3.0 \nmillion (42.7%) in 2002.  This has put  increasing pressure on the urban transport system. \nBetween 1990 and 2001, when real economic growth averaged 10.4% per annum, road traffic \ngrew at 15.7% per annum for passenger traffic, reaching 4.5 billion passenger-kilometers (km); \nand  10.1%  per  annum  for  freight,  reaching  4.0  billion  ton-km.  Movement  of  goods  and \npassengers will increasingly be by road, as road transport is more flexible and responsive to \nneeds in a market economy than other modes. Vehicle ownership in Xi\u2019an grew from 10.1 \nvehicles per 1,000 people to 23.1 during the same period. \n \n3.  The road network in Xi\u2019an is underdeveloped in both quality and extent. The total road \nnetwork grew from 2,852 km in 1995 to 3,298 km in 2001, equivalent to an annual increase of 74 \nkm. The expressway length increased from  16 km to  159 km during the same period. High- \nstandard roads, i.e., above class II, account for only  27% of the total road network, and the \nremaining 73% (class III road and below) are medium- to low-grade paved roads and gravel \nroads. Road density relative to the urban area decreased slightly from 5.64 km per square km \n(km2) in 1995 to 5.21 km per km2 in 2000.1 Road density relative to the population increased from \n3.13 square meters (m2) to 3.66 m2 per capita during the same period, which is less than the \nnational average of 5.9 m2. \n \n4.  Urban infrastructure  development during the ninth Five-Year Plan (FYP) (1996\u20132000) \nreflected Xi\u2019an\u2019s commitment to stimulate the economy through public investment.  Government \ninvestments during this period totaled CNY6.8 billion, or about CNY1.4 billion per year. Because \nof the need to lower transport and logistics costs and remove transport bottlenecks, the road \nsector  received  the  largest  share,  amounting  to  CNY1.9  billion  or  26%.  The  road  sector \ninvestment grew at an average annual rate of  9.4% during this period, and in 2002 reached \nCNY1.2 billion. The project framework summarizing the main features of the proposed Project is \nin Appendix 1.  An urban transport sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Xi\u2019an is the provincial capital and political, economic, and cultural center  of Shaanxi \nProvince.  Xi\u2019an  is  one  of  the  most  important  growth  poles  in  the  western  region.  Xi\u2019an \nmunicipality comprises the city (with eight districts) and five counties, with a total population of \n7.0 million. Xi\u2019an\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) was CNY82.4 billion in 2002, up by 13.5% \nfrom 2001. The GDP is expected to grow by 12.4% per year, reaching CNY117 billion by 2005. \n                                                 \n1 This is due to reclassification of urban areas in 1999, which increased from 162 km2 to 187 km2. ", "2  \nThe average annual per capita income for urban residents was CNY7,184, slightly less than the \nnational average of CNY7,703. For rural residents income per capita was CNY2,641, slightly \nmore than the national average of CNY2,476. The income levels are forecast to increase to \nCNY8,864 and CNY3,500, respectively, by 2005.  \n \n6.  The city is located at the junction of two major highways and two major railways. Around \nthis transport hub, the city has developed into an important industrial and commercial center \nwith many high-tech industries, including electronics, machinery, and pharmaceuticals; and \nservice sectors, such as information technology, finance, and insurance. The state-level Xi\u2019an \nEconomic  Development  Zone  was  established  in  1988  to  attract  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestment. So far, 20 km2 has been developed at a cost of CNY4.1 billion for infrastructure. \nThe 872 enterprises in the zone have a total investment of CNY38 billion. Inadequate road \ninfrastructure, however, is a major constraint on investment by the private sector. Many foreign \ncompanies will not invest in the interior provinces because of weak infrastructure. An ADB- \nsupported survey2  of domestic firms in Xi\u2019an cited poor roads as the most serious infrastructure \nconstraint. \n \n7.  The present  urban transport ni frastructure and services  cannot meet the increasing \ntraffic demand in Xi\u2019an. The incomplete road network, low standard of transport infrastructure, \nlow  flow  capacity  at  surface  intersections,  and  slow  vehicle  speeds  contribute  to  traffic \ncongestion, traffic accidents, and increased vehicle emissions. The main causes of urban traffic \ncongestion are (i) inadequate road infrastructure facilities and services\u2014road density is low and \ncapacity has already been reached; (ii) poor management and maintenance of urban roads\u2014\nthe existing road space is not efficiently used due to inadequate traffic management and road \nmaintenance; (iii) poor public transport services\u2014development is hindered by lack of capacity, \nslow  operating  speeds,  and  outdated  equipment  and  management  practices;  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  weakness\u2014inadequate  coordination  between  multiple  agencies  responsible  for \nurban transport policy, planning, regulations, and operations. The consequent impacts on urban \ntraffic  congestion  include  (i)  increased  transport  costs  comprising  vehicle  operating  costs \n(VOCs) and time; (ii) increasing air pollution due to vehicle emissions that pose health threats to \nurban residents; and (iii) increasing number and severity of road accidents due to poor driving \npractices, large traffic volumes, and narrow roads. \n \n8.  A national symposium, jointly sponsored by  ADB3 and the World Bank in Beijing in \nNovember 1995, discussed the PRC\u2019s urban transport development strategy and developed \nprinciples,  criteria,  and  actions.4 Five principles  were  formulated  to guide urban transport \nplanning and operations: (i) transport is about moving people and goods, not vehicles; (ii) \ntransport prices should reflect full social costs; (iii) transport reforms should deepen to follow \nmarket principles to increase efficiency; (iv) the government\u2019s role should be to guide transport \ndevelopment; and (v) the role of the private sector in providing transport services should be \nencouraged. In line with these principles, the following criteria were adopted for urban transport \npolicies and plans: environmental sustainability, economic viability, financial affordability, and \nsocial  acceptability.  Consistent  with  these  principles  and  criteria,  eight  actions  were \nrecommended:  (i)  reform  urban  transport  administration,  (ii)  upgrade  the  status  of  traffic \nmanagement, (iii) prepare a strategy to mitigate motor vehicle air and noise pollution, (iv) \ndevelop policies to manage traffic demand, (v) develop a strategy for mass transit, (vi) reform \npublic transport management and operations, (vii) develop a financing strategy for the transport \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

", "  3\nsector, and (viii) strengthen the framework for transport planning and capacity building. Some of \nthe recommendations are being implemented in selected cities,5 with some success. \n \n9.  The development of Xi\u2019an is guided by the Master Plan: 1995-2010, which sets out a \nbroad policy on land use and development, and transport infrastructure that will conserve Xi\u2019an\u2019s \nunique character, historical legacy, and environment. The master plan was updated to take into \naccount the significant changes forecast for the next decade.  It provides a good basis for \nplanning  urban  transport  development,  including  public  transport.  Urbanization  and  rapid \neconomic growth are forecast to continue throughout the period. A large increase in office and \ncommercial activities is forecast and will be located centrally. To provide  the required space, \nmajor redevelopment is planned in and adjacent to the city center. In the master plan, the Xi\u2019an \nurban area will be supported by 11 peripheral satellite towns that will be home to Xi\u2019an\u2019s growing \npopulation, industry relocated from the inner city, and new industrial developments. \n \n10.  For three reasons, good transport planning is central to implementing the master plan. \nFirst, because the demand for road space is growing much more rapidly than the supply, there \nare prospects for increased levels of traffic congestion that afflict many large Asian cities. Traffic \ncongestion has direct adverse impacts on the productivity and economic performance of cities, \nand  the  life  styles  of  urban  residents.  Second,  because  transport  systems  fundamentally \ninfluence land use, the master plan can only be implemented if it is supported by a transport \nstrategy. Traffic congestion is already making  Xi\u2019an\u2019s satellite towns inaccessible and less \nattractive to people currently living in the city center. Adequate transport links to the city center \nare necessary to make these satellite towns viable. Third, because Xi\u2019an is Shaanxi Province\u2019s \ncultural center, great importance is attached to preserving and enhancing the city environment. \nWhile  measures  are  being  taken  to  address  environmental  concerns  from  industrial  and \ncommercial  sources,6 there  is  mounting  evidence  that  increasing  vehicle  emissions  will \nadversely affect the  city\u2019s environment, including the historic core. An appropriate transport \nstrategy is necessary to address the situation. \n \n11.  The impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction was analyzed in \na  study  that  examined  the  effectiveness  of  government  expenditure  in  various  sectors  in \ncontributing to growth and poverty reduction in the PRC. The study concluded that investments \nin road infrastructure have a significant impact on poverty reduction, productivity, and growth. \nThe link between transport infrastructure and poverty reduction is also supported by studies7 \nand evaluation of completed transport projects financed by ADB8 and the World Bank.9 An \nongoing TA is examining the socioeconomic impact of road investment in the PRC10 while a \nregional TA11 is being implemented to  review the poverty reduction impact of infrastructure \n                                                 \n5  For example, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Urumqi, and Shijiazhuang. \n6  ADB is helping to reduce air pollution in Xi\u2019an under ADB. 1997.

The private sector will be the PRC\u2019s engine of job generation and the main mechanism \nto increase economic productivity\u2014two essential developments needed to reduce poverty.12 \nAccording  to  ADB-supported surveys (footnote 2), one of which was carried out in Xi\u2019an, \ninfrastructure constraints are among the impediments faced by domestic private companies \noperating in the PRC. Of the 756 domestic firms interviewed, 21% cited poor roads as a major \nconstraint, the second most frequently cited infrastructure constraint after land and buildings. If \nprivate investment is to be attracted to the poor interior provinces, the enabling framework and \ntransport infrastructure, among other things, need to be improved. \n \n13.  The Government is implementing the long-term western region development strategy, a \nkey theme of the 10th FYP (2001\u20132005), to stimulate economic development in the western part \nof the country where poverty incidence is disproportionately high. The strategy aims to reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western region and the coastal region. ADB provided \ntechnical assistance (TA)13 to help the Government formulate macrolevel policies and sector \nstrategies  for  the  long-term  development  of  the  western  region.  Urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment, including roads, was identified as a priority area for investment. The proposed \nProject will support the strategy by improving the urban transport system in Xi\u2019an, an important \ngrowth center in the western region of the PRC. \n \n14.  External assistance to the urban transport sector has come mainly from ADB, the World \nBank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) (Appendix 3). ADB provided two \nloans totaling $155 million for the urban transport projects in Shanghai in 1991 and 1992. The \nprojects supported an urban development process by financing the construction of the Nanpu \nand Yangpu bridges to provide necessary transport capacity across the Huang Pu River.14 Since \n1991, the World Bank has provided $947 million to finance eight urban transport projects. The \nprojects supported urban roads, traffic management and safety, public transport, environmental \nmanagement, and policy and institutional development in selected cities.  JBIC has provided \nabout \u00a572.6 billion to finance urban transport projects in Beijing, Chongqing, Qingdao, and \nWuhan. The proposed  Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s policy  dialogue. Formulation of the \nProject has been coordinated with the World Bank and JBIC. \n \nC.  Policy Dialogue \n \n15.  The policy dialogue agenda was carefully designed and discussed with the Government, \nfocusing on institutional strengthening, traffic management and safety, and vehicle emission \ncontrol. The topics are discussed  in paras.16\u201318. Details are  in the  analysis of the urban \ntransport sector (Appendix 2). \n \n16.  Institutional  Strengthening.  The  urban  transport  system  in  Xi\u2019an  is  under  the \nresponsibility  of  multiple  agencies.  Its  elements\u2014formulating  policy,  planning,  design,  and \nmanaging urban transport infrastructure and services\u2014are fragmented, and coordination across \nagencies is limited. Local technical capacity is limited and unevenly distributed between agencies. \n                                                 \n12 ADB assisted the Government through TA in examining various options for private financing in the road sector. \nADB. 1997.

These bridges were essential for the development \nof the Pudong Area (footnote 18).  ", "  5\nA multisector approach to address the broader urban transport issues in a coordinated manner is \nessential. For this purpose, on 15 November 2002, the Xi\u2019an municipal government (XMG) \nestablished a leading group to coordinate the preparation and implementation of the Project and \nother urban transport activities in the city. The elading group is chaired  by the mayor and \ncomprises 20 senior officials of the municipal and district agencies concerned. The group will be \nmaintained  throughout  project  implementation  and  operation,  and  will  significantly  enhance \ninteragency coordination. \n \n17.  Traffic Management and Safety. Road traffic management and enforcement fall under \nthe responsibility of the Public Security Bureau (PSB). The limited available road space and its \ninefficient use are obvious in Xi\u2019an. Conflict between pedestrians and motorists, inadequate \nparking service, nonmotorized transport (NMT) operations, increased number and severity of \nroad  accidents\u2014all  contribute  to  traffic  system  inefficiencies.  Congestion  is  affecting  the \neconomic productivity of the urban area through increased travel times, higher VOC, and a high \naccident rate. Public transport efficiency is hindered by slow operating speeds.  The current \nisolated traffic signal regime  covering 138 intersections is out of date. A better area  traffic \ncontrol (ATC) system is needed to optimize the use of the available and potential urban road \nnetwork  and  improve  safety.  An  efficient  traffic  management  scheme  is  also  required  to \nintegrate transport modes, NMT, pedestrian movements, public transport, parking services, \ntravel demand measures, and priority facilities, particularly at interchanges. A targeted traffic \nenforcement program and an integrated road safety strategy are also required. In light of the \nfindings  of  the  recently  completed  ADB-financed  TA15 on  road  safety,  assistance  will  be \nprovided to improve traffic management and road safety under the Project. \n \n18.  Vehicle Emission Control. Given the concern about increasing problems with vehicle \nemissions in Asia, ADB has prepared the Policy Guidelines for Reducing Vehicle Emissions in \nAsia.16 In Xi\u2019an, vehicle emissions pose health threats to the urban population.17 Congestion and \ninadequate traffic management make emissions worse. The PSB and Environment Protection \nBureau (EPB) share responsibility for air quality control, inspection and maintenance, annual \nvehicle testing centers, and enforcement. Conversion to cleaner fuel is in progress; 300 buses \nand 10,000 taxies use compressed natural gas (CNG) in Xi\u2019an. There are only 7 CNG stations, \nbut the government plans to build 50 more stations by 2005. Funding limitations and shortages \nof skills and resources are key obstacles to improved vehicle emissions control. Seven vehicle \ntesting centers, operated by the PSB with support from the EPB, inspect safety aspects and \nemission standards. The Xi\u2019an municipal government will strengthen vehicle emission control \nunder the Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 1999.

Lessons learned from the ADB-financed urban transport projects18 suggest that it is not \ncost-effective to charge tolls on urban ring roads and bridges because long lines waiting to pay \nthe tolls would spill over into the connector roads causing traffic congestion. The project cost was, \ntherefore, recovered from municipal road user charges. Other lessons include (i) the benefits of a \ncomprehensive and participatory approach to project preparation, (ii) the benefits of a planned \nand  well-coordinated  resettlement  scheme  preceded  by  adequate  consultation  with  affected \nparties before relocation, and (iii) the need for a professional approach to forecasting traffic \ndemand. While these projects were successful, their development impact would have been \ngreater if more attention had been paid to issues like traffic management, vehicle emissions, and \npublic transport. Their experience demonstrates that the provision of urban infrastructure can \nhave a profound impact on urban land use. Lessons learned from other externally financed urban \ntransport projects19 in the PRC include the following: (i) coordination among agencies concerned \nwith urban transport planning and implementation needs to be improved; (ii) participation of all \nagencies  with  responsibilities  for  urban  transport  is  key  to  developing  an  integrated  and \nsustainable project; and (iii) investment in urban roads needs to be complemented by improving \nother urban transport aspects, such as traffic management and safety, vehicle emission control, \nand road maintenance. These lessons are incorporated in the project design.  \n \n20.  Reviews20 of performance of completed  road projects concluded that, in general, all \nloans to the road sector in the PRC have been or are being  implemented satisfactorily. The \nproject completion reports (PCRs) prepared for nine road projects conclude that six projects21 \nwere generally successful, and one22 was partly successful. The project performance audit \nreports  (PPARs)  for  three  road  projects23 concluded  that  the  projects  were  either  highly \nsuccessful or successful. The lessons learned from previous ADB-financed road projects are \nreflected  in  the  project  design.  To  avoid  delayed  loan  effectiveness  due  to  delay  in  the \nprocurement  process,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works \ncontractors. ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines and requirements were discussed extensively during \nappraisal.  Emphasis  was  put  on  the  need  to  (i)  strictly  follow  ADB\u2019s mandatory bidding \ndocuments,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-approved  evaluation  criteria,  and  (iii) \nsubstantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1997.

This is mainly due to inadequate \nsafety facilities and enforcement, as well as partial compliance with environmental mitigation measures. Remedial \nactions were subsequently taken by rectifying the infrastructure deficiencies, enforcing harsher penalties for traffic \nviolations, and implementing the environmental mitigation measures. As a result, the project was rated successful \nby the PPAR (footnote 23). \n23 ADB. 2000. PPAR on the Shenyang-Benxi Highway and Jilin Expressway Projects in the PRC. Manila; and ADB. \n2001.

The overall  objective of the country strategy and program24 is to promote pro-poor \neconomic growth by giving the poor greater access to opportunities and benefits of economic \nprosperity. The strategy is designed to (i) promote equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) make \nmarkets work more effectively, (iii) protect the environment, and (iv) promote cooperation with \nneighboring countries. An essential thrust of the strategy is to increase assistance to the poor \ncentral and western provinces, including Shaanxi Province, by supporting projects that facilitate \npro-poor economic growth. In the transport sector, the strategy will help remove transport \ninfrastructure  constraints  and  improve  the  urban  environment.  An  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable transport network is needed to promote economic growth and \nbenefit the poor in urban and rural areas. Urban infrastructure, such as road transport systems \nand public utilities, will need to be improved to cope with the increasing burden as a result of \nrapid  urbanization.  The  proposed  Project,  designed  to  remove  transport  bottlenecks  and \naddress environmental concerns in Xi\u2019an, one of the major growth centers in the western region, \nis consistent with PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. The proposed Project is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy,25 which supports investing in the urban sector \nbecause of the central role urban centers play in economic growth. Urban areas are dynamic \nengines of growth and employment creation, centers for innovation and entrepreneurship, and \nsources of social services. \n \n22.  Consistent with the Xi\u2019an master plan,  large investments are programmed for road \nconstruction, a subway system, and public transport operations. Clear and realistic priorities \nneed to be set for future urban development.  Policy and institutional reforms  are needed  in \nurban transport policy and regulations, public transport, traffic management and safety, road \nmaintenance, vehicle emission control, driver education, urban poverty reduction, and private \nsector development. The  master plan  gives priority to the construction of the third ring road \n(TRR)  shown  in  Map  2,  which  will  form  the  main  physical  component  of  the  Project. \nConstruction of a ring road and connector roads will provide efficient and safe access within the \ncity,  and  for  inbound  and  outbound  traffic.  The  Project  will  address  the  growing  traffic \ncongestion caused by the rapid increase in traffic, inadequate road infrastructure, and poor \ntraffic management. The Project has been designed as a public service project because people \nin  the  urban  area  will  all  benefit  from  the  Project  directly  or  indirectly  through  reduced \ncongestion in the urban road network as a whole. The project road users, therefore, will not be \ndirectly charged for its use. Xi\u2019an municipality has identified the Project as a priority investment, \nwhich will also complement ADB\u2019s assistance in developing the Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan section of the \nnational trunk highway system.26 \n \n23.  During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was prepared by the First Highway Survey \nand Design Institute and it was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission \non 30 September 2003. Chang\u2019an University undertook an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA),  which  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  on  22 \nSeptember  2003,  and  the  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  Commission \n(XMURCC) prepared a resettlement plan, which was approved by the leading group (para.16) \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

The loans total $624 million. ", "8  \non 12 September 2003. ADB provided TA27 to supplement the Government studies. A final TA \ntripartite meeting for the Project was held from 31 March to 10 April 2003 and appraisal from 24 \nJuly to 6 August 2003. The Project was formulated based on the findings of the ADB missions, \ninformation provided by the Government,  stakeholder consultations, discussions with other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n24.  The principal objective of the Project is to promote economic growth in Xi\u2019an municipality \nby relieving transport infrastructure bottlenecks. The Project will help develop an efficient, safe, \nand  environmentally  sustainable  urban  transport  system  by  (i)  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity through improved coordination among municipal government agencies, (ii) improving \ntraffic management and safety, (iii) improving vehicle emission control, and (iv) increasing the \ncapacity of urban roads. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n25.  The Project comprises the following components: (i) constructing a 71 km third ring road \n(TRR),28 including interchanges and bridges; (ii) upgrading and constructing 16 km of connector \nroads to integrate the ring road with the overall urban road network; (iii) improving urban \ntransport in four areas: traffic management and safety, vehicle emission control, public transport, \nurban transport planning, and road maintenance; (iv) procuring equipment for road maintenance, \ntransport planning modeling, traffic signals and ATC center, vehicle emission inspection, vehicle \naxle weighing system, CNG filling stations, and  surveillance and communications; (v) land \nacquisition and resettlement; and (vi) consulting services for construction supervision, urban \ntransport component, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. As the project design \ninvolves integration with the existing provincial road, project preparation is being coordinated by \nthe leading group (para.16) with the relevant provincial government authorities. \n \n26.  The urban transport improvement component (Appendix 4) includes (i) an ATC system \nfor  traffic  signals,  main  control  center  and  traffic  management  scheme;  (ii)  developing  a \ncomprehensive urban transport model, and a bus priority corridor scheme; (iii) a road safety \nstrategy and safety audit; (iv) building CNG filling stations, a mobile emission inspection system, \nand formulating an action plan for air quality management and vehicle emissions control; and (v) \nroad  maintenance,  maintenance  equipment,  and  developing  an  asset  management  and \nmaintenance strategy. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n27.  Since 1991, ADB has  provided about $4.2 billion to  finance the development of key \nintercity expressways (3,407 km), which was complemented by improvements in the associated \nlocal road networks (5,516 km). Intercity expressways have promoted economic growth and \npoverty reduction by providing efficient and safe transport across the country. Because of rapid \nurbanization and the resultant urban traffic congestion in urban areas, like Xi\u2019an municipality, an \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2002.

On the eastern and western sections, eight main lanes plus six relief lanes (three on both sides) will be \nconstructed. ", "  9\nefficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable transport system must be developed  in urban \ncenters. The proposed Project will be the first integrated urban transport project in the PRC for \nADB financing since the time of the urban transport projects in Shanghai about a decade ago. \nThis Project will provide a model for other cities in improving an urban transport system. \n \n28.  During  the  feasibility  study,  EIA  and  resettlement  planning,  consultations  were \nconducted with government agencies, civil society, and affected people to discuss project \nalternatives, environmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, and economic \ndevelopment potential. Village investigations and surveys were conducted in both the direct \nimpact area and the broader beneficiary area to assess the potential adverse impacts and \nbenefits of the proposed project. Over 2,000 people were interviewed in public opinion surveys, \nsocial assessment, and resettlement planning. For resettlement planning, consultation meetings \nwere held with the affected districts, wards, and villages. The Project is well known and public \nsupport for it is high. For adversely affected people that expressed concern for the loss of \nfarmland  or  housing,  the  local  officials  explained  the  policies  and  regulations  for  land \ncompensation and housing removal. These concerns have been considered in (i) determining \nthe  alignment  to  reduce  social  and  environmental  impacts;  (ii)  designing  interchanges, \nconnector roads, and pedestrian access; and (iii) preparing a detailed resettlement plan. The \nconsultation  process  was  expanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  appropriate \ncompensation standards and rehabilitation measures for people displaced by land acquisition or \nhouse  demolition.  Villagers  have  participated  in  the  discussions  and  decisions  on  village \nresettlement. Appendix 5 gives details of stakeholder participation and consultation. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n29.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $762 million equivalent, with $296 million \n(39%) in foreign  exchange  and  $466 million equivalent  (61%) in local currency  (Table 1, \nAppendix 6). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The loan will finance about 91% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 35% of \nthe total project cost. The remaining foreign exchange cost of $26 million and the local currency \ncost will be financed by XMG through cash advances and loans. The ADB loan proceeds will be \nmade available by the Government to Shaanxi provincial government (SPG), which will relend \nto XMG with the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. XMG will further onlend \nto  the  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Third  Ring  Road  Construction  and  Development  Company  (Project \nCompany) on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. XMG  will bear the \ninterest rate variation and foreign exchange risks of the loan. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n32.  XMURCC will be the Executing Agency for overall management and implementation of \nthe Project. The wholly state-owned Project Company was established through issuance of the \ncompany registration certificate dated 2 April 2003 for the purpose of  project implementation \nand operation. The Project Company has a board of directors and sufficient technical, financial, \nand administrative staff (Appendix 7). The general manager of the  Project Company will be \nresponsible for overall project management, approval of contracts, and payments. The deputy \ngeneral managers will be  responsible for physical implementation activities on a day-to-day \nbasis and the preparation of progress reports, assisted by a team of qualified engineering, \nfinancial,  resettlement,  and  administrative  staff.  A  project  administration  memorandum, \ncontaining  important  project  data  and  information,  was  prepared  during  appraisal  to  help \nXMURCC  and  the  Project  Company  monitor  project  implementation  and  evaluate  project \nimpact.  The  Project  Company\u2019s  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  developed.  Consulting \nservices will provide assistance in this respect. A land acquisition and resettlement department \nwas established within the Project Company to ensure that appropriate agencies and authorities \ncoordinate land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n ", "  11\n2.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  from  March  2004  to  December  2007.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n34.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The main \ncivil works will be divided into  21 packages to be procured under international competitive \nbidding procedures. Equipment will be procured under either international competitive bidding or \ninternational shopping (Appendix 9). The China International Tendering Company and the China \nInstrimpex International Tendering Company, selected by the Project Company on a competitive \nbasis,  will  handle  international  competitive  bidding.  Prequalified  contractors  with  adequate \ntechnical and financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, \nmay be awarded more than one contract based on the least-cost combination of contracts.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n35.  A  government-financed  domestic  consulting  team,  headed  by  a  chief  supervision \nengineer, will undertake construction supervision activities for  about 3,000 person-months of \nconsulting  services.  A  resident  site  engineer  assisted  by  a  deputy  resident  engineer  and \nsupported by technical and administrative personnel will supervise each contract package. The \nsite resident engineer will report to the chief engineer.  The chief engineer will report to the \ndeputy  general  manager  responsible  for  the  engineering  department.  Additional  domestic \nconsultants will be  engaged for the  urban transport component,  environmental management \nand monitoring, resettlement monitoring and evaluation, and project performance monitoring. \n \n36.  The Project will provide  51 person-months of international consulting services to (i) \nsupport project management during construction; (ii) conduct a safety audit of the project design \nand completed construction works; (iii) help set up and implement quality control procedures; \n(iv) help develop capacity in road safety and vehicle emissions, and prepare action plans in this \nregard; (v) prepare  a procedural manual for good management of the Project Company; (vi) \nhelp  formulate  a  capacity  development  program;  (vii)  undertake  environmental monitoring \nservices;  and  (viii)  establish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management  system, \nincluding assessing the impact of the Project on the poor. The team leader will be in the field \nduring the entire construction period and will act as assistant chief supervision engineer to help \nthe chief engineer certify variation orders, contractor payments, and subcontracting documents, \nand in establishing a contracts management system. All consultants  financed under the ADB \nloan will be selected and engaged based on the quality- and cost-based selection method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Well-qualified  domestic \nconsultants experienced in implementing similar projects will be recruited in accordance with \ngovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 10. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n \n37.  Because of the high priority accorded to the Project and the need to start works in March \n2004, ADB approved on 22 July 2003 advance procurement action for civil works.29 Advance \naction  up  to  the  evaluation  of  bids,  but  not  including  award  of  contracts,  covers  the \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages. \n                                                 \n29 Advance action was reported in the July 2003 edition of ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version). ", "12  \nThe advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe Government and XMURCC have been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n38.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be for large contracts well above $100,000, \ndirect  payment  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  the  loan  funds.  If \ngovernment funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement procedure will \nbe used. To expedite fund flow, statement of expenditures will apply for reimbursing payments \nunder $100,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n39.  The  Project  Company  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  related \nfinancial statements and have them audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing \nstandards consistently applied by external auditors, whose qualifications, experience, and terms \nof reference are acceptable to ADB. The Project Company will submit to ADB within 9 months of \nthe end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, all in the English language. The Government \nis aware of  its stringent requirements for timely submission of audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements. To ensure that internal controls and checks on the project construction \ncosts and operations are effective, the Project Company has established, at ADB\u2019s suggestion, \nan internal audit unit and will maintain it during project implementation and operation. The unit, \ncomprising three accountants, will examine day-to-day transactions before referring them to \nexternal auditors. \n \n40.  The Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting implementation \nprogress  through  quarterly  progress  reports.  Within  3  months  of  completion,  the  Project \nCompany will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n41.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \noutputs,  and  conditions  was  discussed  with  the  Project  Company.  The  indicators  will  be \nreviewed at the start of project implementation and may include (i) economic development and \nsocioeconomic indicators for Xi\u2019an, (ii) transport costs and time for specific types of vehicles and \ntrips, (iii) transport services and transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) income levels, and (vi) \njobs created in construction and maintenance.  Some of these are included in the Project \nframework (Appendix 1). At the beginning of project implementation, the Project Company will \nestablish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at \nproject inception, completion, and 3 years later, and results compared with the baseline. Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  The  Project  Company  will  recruit  a \nqualified  consultant  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation system, and train the staff of the Project Company and other implementing agencies \nin its use. The main sources of data will be (i) secondary data from government sources, (ii) \nsocioeconomic surveys, and (iii) participatory  rapid appraisal. Reports summarizing the key \nfindings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later will be submitted to ADB.  \n \n \n ", "  13\n9.  Project Review \n \n42.  ADB, SPG, XMURCC, and the Project Company will carry out a midterm review of the \nProject  in  2005,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \nThe review will examine progress in sector reforms, policy development, environmental and \nsocial safeguards, and compliance with assurances in the loan and project agreements. \n \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n43.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the \nneed for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of \nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and \ncorruption are discovered.  \n \n44.  Based on XMURCC\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions have been \ntaken: (i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection Bureau will be resident in project offices for \nbidding, construction, and operations; (ii) a supervisory  board has been established in the \nProject Company; (iii) a two-contract system has been established where the winner of a civil \nworks contract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) liaison meetings \nbetween  XMURCC and the Prosecutor's Office are held regularly and warnings about or \ninformation on corrupt practices are discussed; and (v) periodic inspections of contractors have \nbeen instituted to ensure that procedures related to fund withdrawals and settlements are being \nfollowed. \n \n11.  Capacity Building \n \n45.  To cope with its increased infrastructure construction and management activities,  the \nProject Company needs to develop and implement a human resource development plan with \nthe help of international and domestic consultants. The plan will consider the needs, and the \nrecruitment and training requirements identified. One element of the plan will be an international \ntraining program for 170 person-months financed under the loan. It will cover urban transport \noperations, road maintenance and asset management, road safety, transport planning, vehicle \nemissions,  project  management,  infrastructure  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, environmental management, traffic  management, quality control, bridge and road \ndesign, and commercial road development. With the assistance of the international consultants, \nthe XMURCC will prepare for ADB's concurrence a program of training activities, their location, \nand a list of candidates. Findings from the training will be disseminated through XMURCC and \nthe Project Company. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n46.  The  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  the  potential  risks \nassociated with the Project. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs and net \nbenefits will accrue to the project area. \n \n \n \n ", "14  \nA.  Traffic Forecasts \n \n47.  Traffic was modeled over the entire affected road network, with and without the Project, \nto determine the impact of the additional road capacity on road user costs in terms of travel \ntime, VOCs, and accidents. Vehicle trips were assigned to the Xi\u2019an internal and external road \nnetwork using a matrix of 88 zones within the TRR and 24 zones outside the TRR. The road \nnetwork comprises about 3,000 links in 2008 and 4,850 links in 2028.  Based on the ADB-\nfinanced TA (footnote 27), the forecast traffic volume on the TRR is expected to grow from \n14,500\u201348,500 passenger car units (pcu) per day in 2008, depending on the link, to 41,700\u2013\n72,000 pcu in 2018, equivalent to annual growth rates ranging between 3.5% and 11.7%. Traffic \nwill grow more slowly at 4.6%\u20138.2% per annum thereafter to reach 88,800\u2013146,000 pcu in 2028 \n(Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix A). The projected volumes can be accommodated \nin the TRR and justify the construction of the Project. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n48.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project situations. The Project will provide relief for the increasingly congested central \narea of Xi\u2019an, and the connector roads will improve the distribution of traffic between the second \nring road and the Project. Access from the poorer outer areas of the municipality and from nine \nsatellite towns to Xi\u2019an\u2019s relatively developed central area will improve. The investment will \nfacilitate commercial and industrial development in adjacent areas. \n \n49.  The economic costs of the Project reflect the resource costs for construction, operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and the value of agricultural production from land lost permanently. \nThe economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs as a result of improved traffic conditions, (ii) \npassenger time savings, and (iii) savings from avoided physical damage as a result of fewer \naccidents. Environmental benefits will result from avoided vehicular emissions as a result of the \nreduced level of congestion on  the urban road network. However, these benefits were not \nincluded in the economic analysis because an established methodology for their valuation is not \navailable. \n \n50.  The EIRR for the Project is 15.4%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n(Appendix 12). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in benefits, do not significantly \nimpact economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 44% over the estimate for \nthe EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 30% \nto achieve the same effect. In light of previous experience in the PRC road sector, variations of \nsuch magnitude are unlikely. \n \nC.  Municipal Infrastructure Finance \n \n51.  XMURCC  is  responsible  for  providing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  services, \nincluding urban roads, water supply, city sewage services,  central heating, gas,  wastewater \ntreatment, and environmental management and landscaping. The expenditures on the urban \nroads  increased at 35% per annum in the last 5 years and reached CNY1.20 billion, 64% of the \ntotal urban construction expenditures of CNY1.87 billion in 2002. During the same period, urban \ninfrastructure maintenance expenditures increased at 12% per annum and reached CNY230 \nmillion  in  2002.  XMURCC  has  set  a  budget  of  CNY5.54  billion  for  urban  construction \nexpenditures in 2003, almost three times the level in 2002. This budget includes CNY3.2 billion \nfor road construction, accounting for about 57%. The main revenue sources used to finance \nurban construction are central and provincial government grants (4%); municipal taxes, land ", "  15\ntransfer fees, and water fees (21%); local policy income  (7%); project financing from other \nsources (19%); self-raised funds (17%); domestic bank loans (27%); and foreign financing (5%). \nDetails are in Appendix 13. It is currently proposed that the cost of the Project be recovered \nthrough these municipal government revenues. XMG will provide sufficient budget from its \nsources to  cover the O&M costs30 and service debt. The EA will review alternative revenue \nsources from the municipal government revenue and submit its proposal to ADB by the time of \nthe midterm review of the Project. \n \nD.  Impact on Poverty \n \n52.  Key issues identified in the initial poverty and social assessment undertaken during TA \nfact-finding were assessed in  more detail during the poverty reduction and social analysis \ncarried out under the TA (Appendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix B). The key issues related \nto resettlement and impacts on the poor. The broader trends in the project area as well as the \nneeds of affected people and their ability to benefit from the Project were also examined. There \nare 3 million people in the project area: 1.9 million in the urban area of Xi\u2019an municipality, and \n1.1 million in  the rural area.  The lower-income vulnerable groups include  4.2% of  the urban \nresidents earning less than CNY3,000 per capita per annum and 8.0% of the rural residents \nearning less than CNY1,000 per capita per annum. \n \n53.  The Project will have both direct and indirect impacts on the poor. Direct impacts will be \nthrough construction employment opportunities, savings in travel time, and the potential for VOC \nsavings in public transport for passengers to be passed on to passengers. Indirect benefits will \nbe  from  the  urbanization  process  that  will  be  facilitated  by  the  TRR,  which  provides  the \nopportunity for households to diversify and increase employment opportunities and incomes. \nHousehold poverty and vulnerability will be reduced with multiple income earners per household \nand more than one source of income. Rural households with nonagricultural income are better \noff than households that rely only on farming (cropping or livestock) income. The Project will \nprovide indirect benefits through the urbanization process, such as new housing, improved \naccess to social services, and employment opportunities. \n \n54.  The Project does not adversely affect or significantly impact the livelihoods of ethnic \nminorities and is gender neutral in adverse impacts and benefits. The Project includes some \nsocial development actions to enhance benefits for  the poor, women, and vulnerable groups \n(Appendix 14). \n \nE.  Environmental Impacts and Assessment \n \n55.  The Project is classified as environment category A. The EIA concluded that no major \nadverse environmental impacts will result, provided the recommended mitigation measures are \nimplemented. The TA consultants and field visits by ADB staff confirmed the EIA conclusion. \nThe summary EIA for the Project  was circulated to the Board and disclosed to the public \nthrough ADB\u2019s web site on 27 May 2003. In addition to following ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations  will  be \ncomplied  with  during  implementation  and  operation.  To  ensure  that  potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts of project construction and operation are minimized, the environmental \nmonitoring program and mitigation measures, as specified in the EIA, will be incorporated in the \nengineering  design,  contract  documents,  and  budget  allocation  for  implementation. \nEnvironmental impacts during construction include generation of dust during earthwork, noise \n                                                 \n30 The O&M cost of the Project will be sourced from the infrastructure maintenance budget of XMURCC, which is \nprojected to reach CNY870 million in 2005. The Project\u2019s impact on the budget is small. ", "16  \nand exhaust emissions from construction equipment, potential contamination of surface water \nand groundwater with construction-generated wastes, and conversion of agricultural land to \nroads. An environmental impact during operations is a possible increase in vehicle emissions \ndue to increased traffic volume; however, the emission per vehicle will decline with smoother \ntraffic. Mitigating measures include application of good engineering practices (e.g., water spray \nto suppress dust, enforcing standards of construction equipment noise and exhaust emissions), \nconstructing  storm  water  retention  basins,  and  replanting  to  offset  lost  agricultural  land. \nXMURCC is planning and implementing a broad spectrum of traffic management and transport \nsector  projects\u2014expanded  use  of  cleaner  fuels  and  more  stringent  vehicle  emissions \nstandards\u2014that will reduce transport-related pollution intensities. \n \n56.  Given Xi\u2019an\u2019s historical legacy and a large number of historical treasures, there may be \nunexplored archeological sites in the project area. If archeological sites are discovered, any \nimpact  on  them  will  be  minimized  by  standardized  procedures.31 Following  the  Law  of \nArcheology and Antiquity, (i) an advisory team consisting of officials from XMURCC and the \nProject Company, the local cultural bureau, contractor, university academics, and archeologists \nas necessary will inspect the site before construction starts; (ii) the advisory team will identify \nartifacts  that  might  be  unearthed,  and  propose  their  proper  care;  and  (iii)  any  artifacts \ndiscovered will be managed according to size and significance of discovery. \n \nF.  Resettlement Impacts and Plan \n \n57.  The Project will have significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Income \nrestoration  and  rehabilitation  for  both  urban and rural  households  are  addressed  in  the \nresettlement plan. The TRR and connector roads will affect the Yanta, Weiyang, and Baqiao \ndistricts, including 17 wards, and 105 administrative villages. The Project will require about \n1,000 ha for the new or expanded right-of-way, of which 839 ha is collectively owned land. \nAbout 1.3 million m2 of residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial structures will be \ndemolished. In total, 29,044 persons will be affected by project construction:  (i) 3,394 rural \nhouseholds  with  persons  affected  by  land  acquisition  only,  (ii)  540  rural  households  with \npersons  affected  by  both  land  acquisition  and  building/house  relocation,  (iii)  2,736 urban \nhouseholds with persons  affected by building/house relocation, and  (iv) 151 industrial and \ninstitutional enterprises employing 5,087 workers. \n \n58.  A social impact assessment for resettlement was conducted based on feasibility level \nplanning.  About  20%  of  affected  households  were  surveyed  and  all  105  villages  were \ninvestigated and consulted on resettlement planning. The adverse impacts of loss of structures \nare concentrated in the urban/semi-urban areas around the 12 new interchanges. The western \nand eastern sections of the TRR require new alignments.  The northern and southern sections \nwill require widening of the existing  right-of-way for the orbital road, which helps reduce the \nnumber of affected people. The three connector roads mostly follow existing roads that need \nwidening, but some sections will require new alignments, which will displace structures. \n \n59.  The Project Company has prepared a resettlement plan (RP), which meets ADB\u2019s policy \non involuntary resettlement and social protection strategy, as well as the relevant PRC laws and \nXi\u2019an municipal regulations. A summary RP (Appendix 15) was disclosed to the public through \n                                                 \n31 Similar mitigation measures were adopted in previous projects in Shaanxi Province, such as the Tongchuan-Xi\u2019an \nHighway. The measures include (i) realigning the road or building a bridge across major archeological sites; (ii) \ndocumenting, identifying, and cataloging artifacts before relocating major ones to the museum or storing those of \nminor significance; and (iii) in case of very small and minor sites, relocating them as close as possible to the \noriginal site. ", "  17\nADB\u2019s web site on 27 May 2003. The full RP (Supplementary Appendix C) was also posted on \nADB\u2019s web site in November 2003. The RP includes preliminary village rehabilitation plans for \nthe seriously affected areas. The resettlement budget, based on preliminary design data, is \n$180.5 million, excluding contingencies. The Project Company  distributed 5,000 copies of  a \nresettlement information booklet to the affected local governments, enterprises, and households \nin  July  2003.  The  booklet  describes  resettlement  impacts,  the  resettlement  policy  and \nentitlements,  organizational  arrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance \nprocedures. District and ward resettlement offices have been set up for the Project. With \nguidance  from  the  Project  Company,  the  local  government  resettlement  offices  have \nparticipated in impact investigations and have carried out detailed planning for compensation, \nrelocation, and economic rehabilitation after consulting with the affected people. Feedback from \nthe affected people and the public has been considered in formulating these plans. The RP also \nsets out implementation arrangements and provisions for monitoring and evaluation of progress. \nResettlement supervision milestones have been agreed upon (Appendix 15). \n \nG.  Risks \n \n60.  The Project  has been  formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, and social \nrisks. The main risks, which could result in implementation delays and cost overruns, are \nassociated with the unexplored archeological sites that may be discovered during excavation, \ngiven the historical nature of the project area. To mitigate the risks, a special advisory team will \nprepare appropriate mitigation measures. XMURCC has proven experience in dealing with this \nkind of situation. Given the magnitude and complexity of land acquisition and displacement of \nhouses and enterprises, there are potential risks that land acquisition may delay construction \nactivities or that resettlement implementation may not fully restore all livelihoods. These risks \nhave been minimized or will be mitigated by a carefully prepared detailed implementation plan, \ncompensation standards, budget and schedule, which are managed by the Project Company\u2019s \nland acquisition and resettlement department and monitored by an independent institute. Given \nthat, in addition to the EA, various municipal agencies such as the public security bureau and \nenvironmental  protection  bureau  are  involved  in  implementing  the  Project,  interagency \ncoordination may not be carried out as envisaged. To mitigate this risk, a leading group chaired \nby the mayor and comprising senior officials of the local government has been established \n(para.16). \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the relevant provincial and \nmunicipal organizations have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the \nlegal documents: \n \n(i)  Institutional strengthening. XMG will maintain the leading group supported by \nits permanent office to coordinate the preparation, implementation, and operation \nof the Project and other urban transport activities in Xi\u2019an municipality. Guided by \nthe  leading  group,  XMG  will  implement  the  Urban  Transport  Sector  Policy \nReform Action Plan.  \n \n(ii)  Construction quality. XMURCC and the Project Company will ensure that the \nProject is in accordance with  the Government\u2019s technical standards; and that \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  follow \nnational  standards  and  internationally  accepted  practices.  The  international ", "18  \nconsultant  designated  as  the  team  leader-cum-assistant  chief  supervision \nengineer will review and help certify variation orders and contractors\u2019 monthly \npayments, before the chief supervision engineer approves them. \n \n(iii)  Road safety. To ensure safe road facilities, XMURCC and the Project Company, \nwill implement a road safety signage, communication, hazard barriers, traffic \nmonitoring, and vehicle weighing program. XMG will ensure that XMURCC, the \nProject  Company,  and  the  municipal  public  security  bureau  cooperate  to \nimplement the road safety measures. The public security bureau will prepare and \nstart implementing by 30 June 2006 the municipal road safety guidelines and \naction plans in line with the recently approved national road transport safety law. \nBefore  opening  the  TRR,  XMURCC  in  consultation  with  the  public  security \nbureau will prepare and submit a report on the emergency response plan for the \nTRR to ADB for review.  The Project Company will  conduct road safety audit \ntwice: before construction and before opening the  TRR to ensure compliance \nwith safety standards. \n \n(iv)  Cost recovery. XMG through XMURCC will review alternative revenue sources \nfrom the municipal government revenue and will discuss the availability of these \nsources with ADB during the midterm review of the Project in 2005. \n \n(v)  Corporate governance. The Project Company will maintain the internal audit \nunit throughout project implementation and operation. \n \n(vi)  Change in ownership. If (i) any change in ownership of the Project Company or \nproject facilities, or (ii) any sale, transfer, or assignment of the Project Company\u2019s \ninterest in the project road is anticipated, the Government, XMG, XMURCC, and \nthe Project Company will consult ADB at least 6 months before the change. The \nGovernment, XMURCC, and the Project Company, will ensure that any change \nin ownership of the project facilities is carried out ni  a legal and transparent \nmanner. \n \n(vii)  Capacity building. By 31 December 2004,  XMURCC will prepare a human \nresource development plan. Before undertaking international training, XMURCC \nwill prepare, for ADB\u2019s concurrence, (a) a training plan and a list of nominated \ncandidates,  (b)  a  program  of  workshops  to  be  delivered  by  those  trained \ninternationally, and (c) a list of training equipment and aids required to strengthen \ndomestic training programs. Upon completion of each workshop, XMURCC will \nsubmit to ADB an evaluation of the international training and the workshop. \n \n(viii)  Financial reporting. The Project Company through XMURCC will submit to ADB \naudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project  annually  during \nconstruction and in the first 5 years of operation. External auditors will audit such \nstatements. The audited accounts and financial statements will be submitted \nwithin 9 months of the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n(ix)  Environment. XMURCC and the Project Company will ensure that the Project is \nconstructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  environmental  policies  and \nguidelines of the Government and ADB, that any adverse environmental impacts \narising from the Project are minimized by implementing the mitigation measures \nand  environmental  monitoring  program  presented  in  the  EIA,  and  that \nimplementation of the environmental monitoring program\u2014including mitigation ", "  19\nmeasures, and copies of permits, licenses, and clearances\u2014is regularly reported \nto ADB as specified in the EIA, including violations of safety and environmental \nstandards, if any, and their correction. The Project Company will ensure that \nimpact on the archeological sites, if any, will be minimized by taking appropriate \nmeasures, following the Law of Archeology and Antiquity and other relevant \nregulations. \n \n(x)  Vehicle emissions. Before opening the project road, XMG through the Project \nCompany and the municipal EPB will submit to ADB the emission regulation \nlimits prescribed by the Government, penalties for their infringement, and the \nplan for enforcing vehicle emission control for the project road. By 30 June 2006, \nthe municipal EPB will prepare and implement the  action plan  for reducing \nvehicle emissions in Xi\u2019an. \n \n(xi)  Land acquisition and resettlement. SPG, XMG through  XMURCC and  the \nProject Company will ensure that  (a) all land required for the Project will be \nprovided in a timely manner and that the RP will be carried out promptly and \nefficiently, in line with the Government\u2019s Land Administration Law and ADB's \npolicy on involuntary resettlement and social protection strategy; (b) all affected \npeople are consulted before ground clearing starts; (c) sufficient budget will be \nmade available for land acquisition and resettlement, and any obligations in \nexcess of the RP budget; (d) all affected people are compensated on time; and \n(e) those affected are at least as well off as they were before resettlement. SPG, \nXMG  through  XMURCC  and  the  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  RP \nimplementation is monitored by an independent agency and reported to ADB. \nXMURCC and the Project Company will keep ADB informed of the progress of \nresettlement activities through a quarterly progress report. \n \n(xii)  Poverty reduction. The Project Company will cause the contractor to maximize \nthe  employment  of  local  poor  persons  who  meet  the  job  and  efficiency \nrequirements for construction of the project roads. Such workers will be provided \non-the-job training. XMG will ensure that XMURCC to extend the coverage and \nquality of basic urban infrastructure services in the project area to enhance the \npoverty reduction impacts. \n \n(xiii)  Gender  and  development.  XMURCC  and  the  Project  Company  will  follow \nADB\u2019s policy on gender and development during project implementation. They \nwill take all necessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to \nparticipate in planning and implementing the Project, and they will ensure that \ncivil works contractors do not differentiate payment between men and women for \nwork of equal value. \n \n(xiv)  Health risks. XMG through XMURCC and the Project Company, together with \nthe appropriate authorities, will ensure that information on the risks of socially \ntransmitted  diseases  is  disseminated  to  those  employed  during  project \nimplementation.  The  Health  Bureau,  in  consultation  with  XMURCC  and  the \nProject Company, will also ensure that similar information is disseminated to \ntransport operators during operation of the project facilities. \n \n(xv)  Axle loads. XMURCC and the Project Company will adopt appropriate measures \nto prevent overloading on the project  road by installing vehicle axle weighing \nequipment at selected entry points.

Urban Transport Administration \n \n1.  The Xi\u2019an Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Commission controls and coordinates \nurban  transport  development  and  management.  It  is  directly  responsible  for  formulating \nstrategies, policies, and plans for developing urban transport; drafting the annual plan and land \nuse plan; allocating funds; identifying construction projects and  preparing financing plans for \nthose projects; organizing the implementation of large- and medium-scale projects; monitoring \nand supervising the work of related bureaus; and  licensing and verifying the qualification of \ntransport  design  institutes  and  construction  companies.  It  coordinates  related  municipal \ngovernment agencies such as the Planning Commission, Finance Bureau, Public Security \nBureau, Land and Natural Resources Bureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau in dealing \nwith investment planning, financing, pricing and fee setting, traffic control, land acquisition, and \nenvironmental protection. It also coordinates and aligns some overlapping work in planning, \nconstructing,  and  managing  among  its  subordinate  agencies,  including  the  Engineering \nAdministration Bureau, Urban Planning Bureau, and Public Utility Bureau.  \n \nB.  Vehicle Fleet \n \n2.  In 2001, the vehicle fleet of Xi\u2019an municipality totaled 281,732, comprising 92,285 cars, \n4,529 buses, 28,845 small trucks, 20,215 large trucks, 131,346 motorcycles, and others. The \ntotal is up from 97,452 units in 1990, indicating an average annual growth rate of 10.1%. The \nnumber of cars and small trucks increased more rapidly at 11.5% and 12.5%, respectively, than \nthe other categories. As a result, the market share of these two types of vehicles grew from \n28.7% to 32.8%, and 8.1% to 10.2%, respectively. The proportion of large trucks dropped from \n13.8% to 7.2%. The accession of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to the World Trade \nOrganization in December 2001 should increase investment in automobile production. The \nmodernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce unit fuel consumption \nand vehicle emissions. \n \nC.  Land-Use Plan \n \n3.  Xi\u2019an municipality comprises (i) the city proper consisting of an urban area (159 square \nkilometers [km2]) and a peripheral area (69 km2), and (ii) five satellite towns: Chang\u2019an (12 km2), \nGaoling (8 km2), Huxian (13 km2), Lantian (7 km2), and Zhouzhi (7 km). The city proper is the \npolitical, economic, and cultural center, while the satellite towns have local industries, building \nmaterials, by-products, processing of minerals, and feed processing. The total land-use plan \narea is expected to increase to 363 km2 in 2010 and 562 km2 in 2020. Land use is divided into \nnine  purposes:  warehouses  (2.6%),  industrial  (16.7%),  residential  (29.3%),  education and \nscientific research (9.3%), commercial (5.7%), administrative (2.1%), municipal land (4.1%), \npublic facilities (3.5%), and others (26.7%).    \n \nD.  Road Safety \n \n4.  Road  safety  is  a  serious  issue  in  Xi\u2019an.  In  2002,  the  municipality  reported  4,114 \naccidents (58.6 per 100,000 people), 508 fatalities (7.2 per 100,000 people), and 3,214 injuries \n(45.8 per 100,000 people). The Xi\u2019an accident fatality rate is lower than the national average of \n8.3 per 100,000 people. A Road Safety Council was established to improve investigation of and \nreporting procedures for road accidents so as to devise strategies and policies to reduce road \naccidents,  and  to  improve  coordination  among  concerned  agencies.  The  function  and ", "Appendix 2  25\nperformance of the council needs to be strengthened to better serve  the needs of the city. \nImplementing a comprehensive  road safety audit program  as part of the proposed Project \nshould help reduce the number and severity of road accidents in the urban area of Xi\u2019an. \n \n5.  The  problem  of  road  safety  and  responsibility  for  improving  do  not  rest  solely  on \ngovernment departments. Road safety is a shared responsibility among stakeholders, central, \nprovincial and local governments; education and enforcement authorities; health care providers; \nthe media; the insurance industry; community groups and individuals who use or are affected by \nthe road system.  An appropriate road safety strategy will include developing safer attitudes, \nskills, and behavior among users of the road system; improving the safety of roads, the road \nenvironment,  and  traffic  management;  enhancing  the  safety  of  vehicles  and  improving \noperational standards; and achieving greater community and industry awareness and ownership \nof, and participation in road safety. These dimensions are included in the proposed Project. \n \nE.  Vehicle Emissions Control \n \n6.  Air quality in most cities is poor and vehicle emissions pose health threats to the urban \npopulation. Congestion and inadequate traffic management make emissions worse. With rapid \npopulation growth in PRC cities and increasing vehicle ownership, air pollution will worsen if \nmitigation measures are not taken. Xi\u2019an is no exception. \n \n7.  Although the transport sector contributes to pollutants in the overall air shed of Xi\u2019an, it is \ndifficult to tell how much is attributable to fixed versus mobile sources of pollution. Air pollution is \nnot monitored or predicted based on fixed or mobile sources of pollutants. Predictive models do \nnot consider future vehicular technologies, average travel speeds, and length of travel. The \nmodels  are  usually  based  on  current  technologies  and  established  fuel  sources.  A  more \neffective air quality management policy must be developed over the immediate and longer term. \n \n8.  Regulating  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of  local  environmental  protection \nbureaus in cooperation with the traffic division of the public security bureaus.1 The Public \nSecurity Bureau and Environmental Protection Bureau in Xi\u2019an share responsibility for air quality \ncontrol, inspection and maintenance, annual vehicle testing centers, and enforcement.  \n \nF.  Public Transport \n \n9.  In Xi\u2019an, public transport, including local and long-distance buses and taxies, is governed \nby the Xi\u2019an Municipal Transport Bureau. There are 16 providers of local bus transport services. \nMost bus transport is provided by the Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company, which operates 88% of \nthe bus routes. Established in 1979, it is a state-owned enterprise that operates 147 bus routes \nwith a total length of 2,769 km and owns 2,955 buses. It has 13 operational units (including 8 \nsubcompanies and other 5 operational units) with 9,369 employees, and fixed asset of CNY602 \nmillion. \n \n10.  The  remaining  15  public  bus  transport  companies  are  relatively  small  and  mostly \nprivately or collectively owned.  Two companies operate two routes with standard buses and the \nother 13 small companies operate 16 routes with minibuses. Each subcompany or operational \nunit of the Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company has its own bus depot and maintenance plant. In the \nlast few years, the bus fleet has rapidly increased. However, the number and capacity of bus \n                                                 \n1 The Government strengthened the control of emissions from motor vehicles by amending the Air Pollution     \nPrevention and Control Act in April 2000. A new chapter was added to the law to cover motor vehicle pollution. ", "26 Appendix 2 \ndepots have not increased at the same pace. Consequently, the existing depots are operating at \ncapacity and approximately one third of the Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company buses park on the \nstreet when they are not in service. \n \nG.  Nonmotorized Transport \n \n11.  Nonmotorized transport (NMT), particularly bicycles, is an important mode of transport, \nespecially for trips to and from work. The flat topography of Xi\u2019an renders the NMT an attractive \nmeans  of  personal  transport  although  their  use  could  be  affected  by  inclement  weather, \nespecially ice and snow in winter. NMT is pollution-free and provides door-to-door service for \nshort to medium trips. They occupy less road space than motorized vehicles and their efficiency \n(occupancy/road space required) is better than that of cars and taxis, but comparable with that \nof a half-full bus. NMT will continue to play a role in the multimode transport system in Xi\u2019an. \nThe test scheme of area traffic control intersections as part of the proposed Project should have \na positive impact on NMT in terms of travel time and improved safety. \n \nH.  Policy Dialogue \n \n12.  A policy dialogue agenda was designed and discussed with the Government. It focuses \non  these  key  issues:  institutional  strengthening,  traffic  management  and  safety,  vehicle \nemission control, road maintenance, and urban and public transport planning.

The Project comprises five urban transport initiatives: (i) traffic management and road \nsafety, (ii) vehicle emission control, (iii) road maintenance, (iv) urban transport planning, and (v) \npublic transport. \n \nA.  Traffic Management and Road Safety \n \n1.  Area Traffic Control Center and Traffic Signals \n   \n2.  The Project will expand the current small traffic signal system of the Public Security \nBureau (PSB) to include 110 additional signalized intersections. The new system will include a \nfully equipped Area Traffic Control (ATC) Center with a capacity to handle over 250 signalized \nintersections. The center will be located in a newly built Traffic Management and Signal Control \ncomplex.  The  new  system  will  enhance  road  traffic  flow,  increase  vehicle  speed,  reduce \nintersection delay, and improve road safety on the urban roads in Xi'an. To implement the new \nATC system, the PSB will (i) review existing traffic signal deployment and its application; (ii) \nassess the benefits and weakness of the existing signalized system including intersection \nchannelization, signal phasing and timing, and vehicle and pedestrian delays; (iii) identify the \nlocation  of  new  and  potential  ATC  intersections;  (iv)  collect  traffic  data  at  the  new  ATC \nintersections; (v) carry out a pilot study of a selected number of the new ATC intersections in a \nselected district to demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of ATC system development; (vi) \nevaluate the potential development and expansion of an ATC system to cover all intersections in \nXi\u2019an; (vii) assess the costs and benefits based on a study analyzing the situation before and \nafter implementation of the ATC system, and evaluation of car drivers/passengers, bus riders, \ncyclists, and pedestrians; and (viii) prepare the implementation and procurement program for \nthe ATC system.  \n \n3.  The Project will improve relevant intersections, considering the following issues: (i) \nimprove  staff  capability  for  applying  recognized  technical  packages  for  signalized  and \nnonsignalized intersection analysis; and (ii) prepare a comprehensive program to collect traffic \ndata, and carry out regular intersection analysis and monitoring. \n \n2.  Road Safety Audit Program \n \n4.  Implementing an effective road safety audit program is an efficient way to improve road \nsafety conditions and to reduce the number and severity of accidents. A road safety audit is a \nformal examination of existing or future road conditions, which interacts with road users. An \nindependent,  qualified  examiner  reports  on  the  project's  accident  potential  and  safety \nperformance. A road safety audit considers all road users, including various pedestrian groups, \ncyclists,  motorcyclists,  and  operators  of  heavy  vehicles.  It  relies  heavily  on  established \nguidelines and standards, and also on the ability of the auditor to recognize a potentially \nhazardous combination of elements, which may not be covered by specific guidelines. The main \nreason for conducting road safety audits is to prevent road accidents by identifying potential \nsafety problems that may require corrective action. Road safety audits seek to ensure that, as \nfar as practicable, road and traffic schemes are safe and fit for the purpose for which they are \nintended. The project roads will be subject to road safety audit during the design stage and prior \nto opening. The Project will also include a comprehensive road safety audit program across \nXi\u2019an by ensuring that (i) elements that could cause accidents  (e.g., road furniture near the \nedge of traffic lanes) are not present in the road network; (ii) elements that could reduce the risk \nof road accidents (e.g., anti-skid surfacing) are included in the operational road network; and (iii) \nelements that reduce the severity of road accidents  (e.g., accident barriers) are included in the \noverall road network. ", "30 Appendix 4 \n 5.  Other objectives, which flow from this, are to minimize the risk of accidents on the \nadjacent road network and to promote the importance of road user safety when constructing \nand operating roads.  \n \n3.  Road Safety Strategy \n \n6.  The Project includes the development of a comprehensive road safety strategy for Xi\u2019an, \nutilizing international consulting services. The strategy will draw on the outcome of the recently \ncompleted  ADB-financed  Technical  Assistance  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC): \nCapacity Building in Traffic Safety Planning and Management.   \n \nB.  Vehicle Emission Control  \n \n1.  Compressed Natural Gas Stations \n \n7.  There are only seven compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in Xi'an; two are used \nexclusively by public transport buses. Many more are needed. The Project will finance the \nconstruction  of  10  new  CNG  stations,  which  will  include  civil/foundation  works,  piping, \nelectrification and CNG filling equipment.  \n \n2.  Mobile Emission Inspection System \n \n8.  Only the Environment Protection Bureau has the capacity to carry out roadside emission \ninspection of vehicles at two locations at a time. To facilitate better emission control on road \nvehicles, a mobile emission test system is required. The Project will finance a fully equipped \nmobile emission inspection vehicle, and some inspection units.  \n \n3.   Action Plan  \n \n9.  With the help of consultants, a comprehensive quality management and vehicle emission \ncontrol action plan will be prepared under the Project. The plan will relate to existing and future \nland use and development of traffic zones. Existing and planned transport infrastructure will be \nconsidered in applying the plan.   \n \nC.  Road Maintenance \n \n10.  Many roads in the urban areas of Xi\u2019an municipality are old and require maintenance. \nExisting road maintenance equipment is inadequate to maintain the urban road network in \nacceptable condition. Better maintenance is needed to reduce road accidents and to facilitate \nsmoother traffic operations. The Project will finance equipment to implement more effective road \nmaintenance programs for all roads in the urban area, and will finance the maintenance of \nselected  urban  roads,  including  improvement  of  pedestrian  movements  and  nonmotorized \ntransport lanes.  \n \nD.  Urban Transport Planning \n \n11.  Because future urban transport planning and design work depends on reliable traffic \nforecasts, a comprehensive traffic forecasting and planning model should be developed for Xi'an \nmunicipality. The existing model developed by Chang'an University needs improvement to better \npredict future traffic volumes on urban roads by different transport modes. A comprehensive \ntraffic forecasting and planning model will be developed. The Xi'an municipal government will \nundertake the following actions: \n  ", "Appendix 4  31\n(i)  Assemble comprehensive transportation database.  Origins and destinations for \nall components of the survey will be aggregated to a detailed traffic zone system \nwithin the study area. The quality and validity of data will also be verified.  \n \n(ii)  Prepare  a  transport  model  data  bank.  A  data  bank  based  on  the  software \npackage selected for model application will be prepared incorporating the base \nyear data required for model calibration. \n \n(iii)  Expand the zone system to increase the reliability of model forecasts for strategic \nplanning studies and facilitate the ready integration of model output into local \ntransport studies at some future date. The number of zones will represent an \nacceptable compromise between improved model outputs on the one hand and, \non the other hand, increased complexity, data input requirements, time required \nto run the model, and the effort required to interpret and analyze the model \noutput. \n \n(iv)  Carry out model development and calibration. The refined model system will be \nimplemented on any commercial software with a suitable user-friendly interface \nand with appropriate model procedures. The model will be calibrated using \naccepted  international  procedures.  The  calibrated  model  will  be  updated \nperiodically to reflect the changing travel pattern in Xi'an.  \n \nE.  Public Transport  \n \n12.  The Project will develop an action plan to improve public transport operations in Xi\u2019an, \nand a bus priority corridor scheme. Implementing this subcomponent will require the following \nsteps: \n \n(i)  Review existing public transport services and bus priority schemes implemented \nin other major cities in the PRC.  \n \n(ii)  Review existing bus routing patterns in Xi\u2019an, taking into consideration future \ndevelopment and the subway. \n \n(iii)  Identify existing and future major land use and transport projects, which will have \na major impact on public transport travel patterns and operations. The plan of \nfuture public transport services will avoid direct competition with future rail mass \ntransit projects. \n \n(iv)  Examine potential routes for introducing better public transport services and bus \npriority measures. Consider factors such as adjoining land uses, right-of-way \nwidth, number and occupancy of existing bus routes, number of vehicular lanes \nand  car  volumes,  bicycle  segregation,  pedestrian  sidewalk  width,  landscape \ninstallations, cost implications, and other physical constraints. \n \n(v)  Undertake a study to estimate potential corridor traffic and ridership, travel time \nsavings, and other benefits and overall costs of implementation. \n \n(vi)  Evaluate the costs and benefits of this element of the Project, considering person \nand vehicle trips.

Chang\u2019an University\u2019s Xi\u2019an traffic model was used to develop traffic forecasts for the \narea road network (details in Supplementary Appendix A). Trips were assigned to network links \nwith and without the project roads, for a representative peak hour (with 8.33% of daily volume) \nand for a representative off-peak hour (with 5.50% of daily volume). The forecast daily trip \nvolumes in the assigned matrices from the base year 2003 to the final forecast year 2028 are \ngiven  in  Table  A11.1.  Trips  were  assigned  and  link  capacities  were  defined  in  terms  of \npassenger car units (pcu). The forecast annual average growth rate in vehicle trips on the \nnetwork during 2003-2028 is 4.8%.    \n \nTable A11.1:  Trip Volume on Network, 2003-2028  \n(\u2019000 per day) \n \nType of Trip  2003  2008  2018  2028 \nPassenger (vehicles)  1,098  1,377  2,175  3,359 \nFreight (vehicles)        199        264         462         788 \nTotal (vehicles)  1,297  1,641  2,637  4,147 \nTotal (pcu)  1,386  1,912  3,390  5,571 \n  pcu = passenger car unit. \n  Source: Chang\u2019an University. \n \n2.  The increase in network capacity provided by the project roads benefits (i) existing traffic \nand traffic diverted to the roads, and (ii) traffic on other roads which flows more freely in the \nabsence of the diverted traffic. To evaluate these benefits, the economic analysis is based on \nthe difference the new capacity makes to travel time and vehicle operating costs over the whole \nnetwork. The benefits per affected vehicle are higher in peak than in off-peak hours due to the \ngreater congestion. Total travel time and distance traveled per day in pcu and the resulting \naverage operating speeds for 2008, 2018, and 2028 are in Table A11.2, with and without the \nproject roads. Distance traveled is slightly higher with the roads in later years, but there is a \nsignificant  increase  in  network  average  speed,  saving  both  passenger  time  and  vehicle \noperating costs. The annual vehicle time saving grows from 7 million hours in 2008 to 87 million \nhours in 2028, an annual average rate of increase of over 13%.  \n \nTable A11.2:  Impact of Project Roads on Network Performance  \n \nOperating Time     Distance Run \nYear  (\u2019000 pcu hours per day)   (million pcu km per day) \nWith Project  Without Project    With Project  Without Project \n2008  860  883  36.62  36.64 \n2018  2,956  3,027  74.68  74.12 \n2028  5,205  5,523  136.20  135.27 \nkm = kilometer, pcu = passenger car unit.  \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n3.  Traffic growth rates are generally higher on the project roads than on the network as a \nwhole.

The Project, comprising the 71-kilometer (km) ring road and 16-km of connector roads in \nXi\u2019an municipality will be implemented in about 4 years. The economic analysis covers 20 years \nof operation. Without the Project, traffic will use the existing urban road network, which will soon \nbe congested and expensive to maintain because of the rapidly increasing traffic. With the \nProject, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on both project roads and \nexisting roads will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel.  \n \nA.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n2.  Cost. Economic evaluation was undertaken using constant 2003 economic prices. The \nproject costs and benefits were revalued at economic prices by separating the cost items into \ntradable materials and equipment, nontradable materials, labor, and land. The prices  were \nexpressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.08 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the \nwages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since there was no surplus of \nskilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate \nto an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \n3.  Benefit. Passenger time savings account for 57% of the project benefits. Travel time \nwas valued based on the average income in the project area. The value of time over the \nanalysis period was increased by the forecast growth in real per capita income in the project \narea. The real value of time per person-hour and per vehicle-hour over the analysis period is \ngiven in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Value of Time  \n(CNY/hour) \n \nYear  Person  Car            Bus \n2008  4.3  10.7           127.7 \n2018  6.9  15.6           191.0 \n2027  9.9  20.0           246.8 \n      Source: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n4.  Vehicle operating costs (VOCs) were developed for seven vehicle types: car; medium \nand heavy bus; light, medium, and heavy truck; and truck trailer. The VOCs were estimated for \neach type. The operating costs per km at speeds of 15\u201390 km per hour (kph) are given in Table \nA12.2. The traffic assignment is link flow in passenger car units (pcu). As vehicle composition by \nlink was not  available, a composite curve was developed representing the weighted average \noperating cost at each speed, based on a representative traffic composition. The total operating \ncost for networks with and without the project roads was calculated by applying the cost curve \nequation to the modeled operating speed and traffic volume on each link. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 12  47\nTable A12.2: Vehicle Operating Costs by Operating Speed in kph \n(CNY per km) \n \n  VOC at Speed in kph \nVehicle Type  15  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 \nCar  2.18  1.93  1.48  1.14  0.90  0.75  0.71  0.76  0.91 \nMedium Bus  2.70  2.39  1.87  1.46  1.16  0.99  0.94  1.00  1.18 \nLarge Bus  3.52  3.13  2.45  1.93  1.57  1.36  1.31  1.42  1.68 \nLight Truck  1.80  1.60  1.27  1.01  0.84  0.75  0.74  0.81  0.97 \nMedium Truck  2.30  2.03  1.60  1.27  1.05  0.93  0.92  1.00  1.20 \nHeavy Truck  3.32  2.93  2.28  1.79  1.45  1.27  1.24  1.37  1.66 \nTruck Trailer  3.78  3.37  2.68  2.15  1.78  1.58  1.55  1.68  1.98 \n           km = kilometer, kph = kilometer per hour. \n           Source: Technical assistance consultants.   \n \n5.  The benefits from the reduced number of accidents are an important part of economic \nbenefits. Accident reduction was estimated from the findings of a study on accidents carried out \nby the Highway Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications. Although the \neconomic cost of accidents may be higher on the project ring road than on the existing roads \ndue to higher severity, with the Project the number of accidents per vehicle-kilometer will be \nreduced substantially, resulting in net cost savings derived from avoided accident costs. The \nreduction in lives lost was not quantified in the analysis. \n \nB.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n6.  The primary objective of the project road is to provide adequate capacity in the selected \ncorridors up to the design year. The designs are consistent with a reasonable quality of service, \ngiven the forecast peak-hour traffic volumes. The corridors themselves were chosen to accord \nwith the land use plan of the Xi\u2019an municipality. The planners considered directly serving areas \nnorth of the orbital road by aligning the northern section of the third ring road (TRR) accordingly. \nThis option was dropped on cost grounds. Aligning the southern section of the TRR to the south \nof the orbital road was not considered necessary for land use planning. The northern and \nsouthern sections along the orbital road are least-cost solutions to provide the required increase \nin corridor capacity. \n \n7.  Both  the eastern and western sections of the TRR are on new alignments. These \nalignments were selected primarily to promote new development corridors for the city, to ease \nthe development pressure on the increasingly congested central areas. The alternative options \nto provide additional capacity in the eastern and western corridors\u2014widening the eastern and \nwestern sections of the orbital road or constructing an elevated road on top of the second ring \nroad\u2014would both forgo the development benefits and result in the large area between the \norbital road and the second ring road not being adequately served. An elevated road on the \nsecond ring road would be very expensive because some sections are over watercourses. \n \nC.  Urban Transport Component \n \n8.  The benefits from the urban transport component were quantified, where appropriate, \nseparately from the main road component. First, for the area traffic control subcomponent, \nwhich  provides  equipment  for  the  control  center  and  controlled  traffic  signals  at  110 \nintersections, passenger time savings to motorized and nonmotorized transport were evaluated \nseparately. Time  savings  would  amount  to  CNY138 million comprising CNY117 million to \nmotorized  transport  and  CNY21  million  to  nonmotorized  transport.  Second,  the  pavement ", "48 Appendix 12 \nmaintenance equipment will  improve the surface condition  from an international roughness \nindicator of 4.0 to 3.0 on 690 km of urban roads (other than the project roads). The resulting \naverage VOC saving is CNY0.074 per vehicle km for about 4,000 vehicles in 2008. The total \nVOC savings will be about CNY82 million in 2010. Third,  the road safety strategy and audit \nprogram will enable the government to implement programs to enhance road safety, reduce the \nnumber  and  severity  of  accidents,  and  improve  public  awareness  of  ownership  of  and \nparticipation in road safety.  This would reduce travel delays caused by conflicts between \nvehicles and bicycles or  pedestrians. With an effective road safety program in place, road \naccidents could be reduced by 2\u20134% a year. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n9.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 15.4% (Table A12.3). Time \nsavings are the major economic benefit (57%), followed by VOC savings (41%), and accident \ncost savings (2%). Sensitivity analysis tested seven scenarios to assess the robustness of the \nresults of the economic analysis (Table A12.4). The capital cost would have to be more than \n44% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the \npast experience of ADB\u2013financed projects in the PRC road sector, this switching value is \nunlikely to occur. ADB-financed road projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns, and the contract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more \nthan 30% to make the Project economically nonviable. A reduction in the value of time by 30% \nand a 1-year delay in completion  do not affect economic  viability. Combinations of adverse \neffects of costs and benefits were also tested. The  result  showed  that  the  Project  would \nmaintain its economic viability under those scenarios.

Yes  poverty partnership agreement?  Yes  \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nUrban infrastructure development, including roads, is identified as a priority area for investment. The \nproposed  Project  will  support  the  strategy  by  improving  the  urban  transport  system  in  Xi\u2019an \nmunicipality, which is strategically located to provide an important link between the western and \neastern regions of  the PRC. The Project  is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy, which \nhighlights the rationale for investing in the urban sector on the basis of the central role played by \nurban centers in economic growth. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                  Classification: Other \n \nTransportation and road projects can contribute to poverty reduction in a number of direct and \nindirect ways.  Improvements in access and mobility are a key step in poverty reduction. Poverty \nanalysis was carried out to identify the causes of poverty in the project area and to determine \nwhether the Project could be enhanced to increase its impact on poverty reduction.  \n  \nThere are 3 million people in the project area: 1.9 million in the urban area and 1.1 million in the rural \narea. Of the urban residents 4.2% earn less than CNY3,000 per capita per annum, while 8.0% of the \nrural residents earn less than CNY1,000 per capita per annum. Consequently the recommended \npoverty classification of the Project is \u2018Other\u2019 as it is not a poverty intervention project; nonetheless, \nthe economic benefits of the project will have indirect benefits for the poor. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder  participation  and  consultation  have  been  going  on  since  the  start  of  the  Project. \nIntroductory meetings with key agencies and the districts in the project area during the feasibility \nstudy  have  continued  throughout  the  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  executing  agency  (EA) \nconsulted  the  affected  people  directly  during  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and \nresettlement plan preparation. The TA developed a consultation plan, which provides the basic steps \nof a process that can be continued by the EA to ensure that affected people and key agencies are \nkept informed and that a mechanism for feedback and grievance redress is in place before project \nimplementation. The resettlement planning process was particularly concerned with ensuring that \npeople are aware of their entitlements and identifying the needs of those who will require relocation \nas a result of the Project.   \n \nParticipation strategy required: Implementation of the resettlement plan will include participation from \nthe affected people in terms of developing village rehabilitation strategies, deciding on collective \ninvestment  of  land  compensation  funds,  reestablishing  commercial  shops  and  project-related \nemployment opportunities. \n \n ", "52 Appendix 14 \nD.

Based on the findings, a poverty \nand  social  analysis  was  carried  out  to  ensure  that  the  Project  meets  safeguard  policy \nrequirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. \n \n2.  By current government standards of poverty, the project area has a relatively low poverty \nincidence (Table A14.1) because Xi\u2019an is the capital and economic hub of Shaanxi province. \nAbout 3 million people live in the project area: 1.9 million in the urban area and 1.1 million in the \nrural area. The low income population includes 4.2% of urban residents earning less than \nCNY3,000 per capita per annum and 8.0% of rural residents earning CNY1,000 per capita per \nannum. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 14  53\nTable A14.1:  Poverty Data of Xi\u2019an and the Project Area, 2001 \n \nXi\u2019an \nParameter  Project Area \nMunicipality \nPopulation  3,013,066  6,948,369 \n- Rural   1,122,769  4,022,129 \n- Urban   1,890,297  2,926,240 \nNational Key Working County for Poverty Reduction   0  1 \nDistricts/Counties Having Poverty Reduction Program  2  6 \nTownship/Subdistrict with Concentration of Poor  9  49 \nVillages with Poor and Low Income Population    1,042 \nKey Working Villages Under 2001\u20132010 Poverty Reduction \n56  390 \nProgram \nRegistered Poor (<CNY625/capita/year)  13,195  358,450 \nRural Poverty Incidence (below CNY625)\u2014Official                      1.2%                       8.9% \nRural Poverty Incidence (below CNY1,000)\u2014Survey                      8.0%   \nUrban Poverty Incidence (below CNY2,160)\u2014Official    6.0% \nUrban Poverty Incidence (below CNY3,000)\u2014Survey and Estimate                      4.2%  18.0% \n Source: Xi\u2019an Municipal Poverty Alleviation and Development Office and technical assistance consultants. \n \n3.  The community surveys provided some insight into the reasons for poverty in the project \narea.  For the rural poor, dependence on agriculture, and often cropping, as the sole activity was \ncited as the main reason.  Difficult access was also cited by rural focus groups. Some 11 of the \n40 villages participating in the community survey had access only via gravel and earth roads, \nand this situation constrains economic activities. For the urban poor, unemployment of the sole \nor main income earner and lack of skills were the most common reasons.  Large households \nand households with sick or disabled members, as well as unregistered people looking for \ncasual work, were cited as contributing to poverty in rural and urban households alike. \n \n4.  Poverty Impacts.  The Project will have both direct and indirect impacts on poverty.  \nDirect impacts will be derived from construction employment opportunities, savings in travel \ntime, and the potential for vehicle cost savings in passenger transport (buses) to be passed on \nto passengers. The Project will benefit the local poor and migrant workers by hiring unskilled \nand semiskilled labor for construction activities. It has been observed that most of the job \nopportunities in other road construction projects in and around Xi\u2019an go to the poor since the \nwork is arduous and relatively low paying compared with other opportunities in the city. On-the-\njob training to be provided will improve the chances for reemployment once road construction is \ncomplete. The poor will benefit from employment and income generation opportunities that \nresult from the third ring road (TRR) and induced urbanization. Congestion on the first and \nsecond ring roads will be reduced, and travel times will improve by 1\u20132 km/hour over the entire \nnetwork, generating substantial economic benefit for all users. \n \n5.  Major long-term indirect benefits will be derived from the extension of the radial roads \nbeyond the TRR and orbital road, which will improve access to the satellite towns and rural \nareas. The poor will benefit from trickle down effects from improvements in the local economy. \nAccelerated urbanization related to the construction of the TRR will give households more \nopportunities to diversify income. Household poverty and vulnerability will be reduced with \nmultiple income earners and more than one source of income.  Survey data shows that rural \nhouseholds with incomes over and above that derived solely from agricultural production are \nbetter off than households that rely solely on farming (cropping or livestock). \n ", "54 Appendix 14 \n6.  Social Impacts. The alignment of the TRR was selected to minimize potential adverse \nsocial impacts. The northern and southern sections of the alignment will be common with the \norbital road. The affected people and enterprises are aware of the Project and the construction \nimpacts.  \n \n7.  The Project will not have any adverse or significant social effect on minority groups.  \nThere  is  only  one  ethnic  minority  group  in  the  project  area\u2014the  Hui  (Muslim)  who  are \nconcentrated in the inner city districts.     \n \n8.  Women will not be adversely affected by the Project by virtue of their gender. They will \nequally  share  the  project  benefits.  Nonetheless,  some  measures  have  been  included  to \nenhance the benefits to women. They include income restoration through microcredit, capacity \nbuilding, preferential hiring policy for project construction, and training programs.  \n \n9.  Social Development Action Plan. A social development action plan (Table A14.2) was \nformulated and endorsed by the Project Company to ensure that potential social impacts are \nmitigated. The plan includes expanded public bus services, protection of communities from \nconstruction disturbances, control of transmissible diseases, cultural relics and ecotourism \nresource protection, and priority to local poor and women for construction works. The required \nactions, responsible agencies, and funding sources for these measures are set out in the social \ndevelopment action plan. \n \n10.

The third ring road (TRR) and upgraded connector roads will pass through 3 districts, 17 \nwards, and 105 villages. The project components will permanently occupy 1,000 hectares (ha), \nof which 839 ha is owned by village collectives and requires compensation. Efforts were made \nto reduce resettlement  impacts by selecting a route that would  occupy as little farmland as \npossible and require demolition of as  few houses as possible. The alignment was close to \nvillages without going through built-up areas. The general alignment of the ring road has been in \nthe Xi\u2019an master plan for many years. In many places the local government had restricted new \nconstruction along the proposed alignment. The decision to combine the northern and southern \nsections with the orbital road reduced the amount of land acquisition by 170 ha and avoided \n475,059  square  meters  (m2)  of  buildings/houses,  thereby  reducing  the number of people \naffected. During construction, an additional 330 ha will be used temporarily for 1\u20133 years. The \nfloor  space  of  total  buildings/houses  lost  is  1.3  million  m2,  of  which  73%  is  village \nresidential/commercial area and 27% institutional/enterprise premises.  \n \n2.  It is estimated that (i) 3,394 rural households will be affected only by land acquisition, (ii) \n540 rural households will be affected by both land acquisition and building/house relocation, (iii) \n2,736  rural  and  urban  households  will  be  affected  only  by  residential/commercial  area \nrelocation, and (iv) 151 enterprises with a total staff of 5,087 will be affected either directly or \nindirectly. A total of 29,044 persons will be affected, making up 2% of the total population in the \nthree districts immediately affected by the Project (Table A15.1).   \n \nTable A15.1: Population Affected by the Project \n \n        Affected \nWard/Township  Village  Household  Population \nDistrict   Enterprises \nTotal  Affected    Total Affected    Total  Affected    Total  Affected    Units  Persons \nYanta      8         5    201  28    147,275  1,394    588,102      6,004     23  442 \nWeiyang    12         9    252  60    116,614  2,982    385,731  12,154    112  4,071 \nBaqiao    11         3    259  17    121,944  1,754    433,623  10,866      16  574 \nTotal     31       17    712      105    385,833  6,130    1,407,456  29,044    151  5,087 \n        Source: Resettlement Plan. \n \nB.  Resettlement Principles and Compensation \n \n3.  Land acquisition is governed by the 1998 Land Administration Law of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the 1999 Methods of Execution of the Land Administration Law in Shaanxi, \nand the 2003  Management Regulations of Xi\u2019an Urban Building Removal. Resettlement will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Social Protection Strategy, as well as the \nlocal resettlement practices for similar projects in Xi\u2019an. The resettlement plan (RP) addresses \nlosses and impacts on different groups, businesses, and structures. Based on the inventory of \nlosses, an entitlement matrix was developed, which recognizes all types of affected persons \n(AP) and their losses, irrespective of ownership or registration (Table A15.2). Losses suffered \nby AP have been categorized as land loss, structure loss, land attachment loss, business/salary \nloss, and crop loss. \n \n4.  The main objective of the RP is to restore and improve the economic condition of the \nAPs,  particularly  vulnerable  groups.  Measures  such  as  a  transitional  allowance  for  lost \nlivelihood, business/economic rehabilitation support, and training for livelihoods were adopted. \nEconomic  rehabilitation  will  be  partly  supported  by  employment  and  income  generation \nopportunities related to project construction works.  \n ", "Appendix 15  57\nC.  Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure of RP, and Grievances \n \n5.  Since the Project will have significant impacts, community views were sought through \nconsultation meetings. Between July 2002 and February 2003, 33 focus group discussions were \nconducted, 1,550 households in 22 affected villages were surveyed, and owners of 20 affected \nenterprises were interviewed. From April to June 2003, all affected villages and enterprises \nwere investigated and consulted, and seriously affected villages formulated initial rehabilitation \nplans. In July 2003, 5,000 copies of a resettlement information booklet were distributed to all \naffected  villages,  households,  and  enterprises.  In  August,  the  approved  compensation \nstandards and road alignment were announced to the local people. At various stages of project \nplanning,  APs  were  informed  of,  and  consulted  about,  the  likely  impacts  of  the  Project. \nStakeholders consulted included (i) heads of households/business units to be affected; (ii) \nvillage heads and villagers\u2019 representatives; (iii) local government agencies and departments; \nand (iv) women, the poor, and other vulnerable groups.  More intensive consultations were \nundertaken to formulate village rehabilitation plans for the most seriously affected villages. The \nconsultations will continue throughout project implementation.  \n \n6.  The RP prepared by the Xi\u2019an Municipal Third Ring Road Construction and Development \nCompany (Project Company) was discussed with  local government agencies to understand \nlocal and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies, compensation standards, and resettlement \nstrategy. Public consultation meetings held in each affected district verified local support for the \nProject. Regarding land acquisition and resettlement, there were concerns about adjusting the \nroad alignment, improved compensation standards, resettlement  options, and entitlements. \nOnce the final design is approved, there will be a detailed measurement survey of the alignment \nand  compensation  agreements  will  be  signed  with  all  affected  villages,  households,  and \nenterprises.  \n \nD.   Resettlement Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n \n7.  Resettlement site selection  was considered with the income restoration plans. There \nwere three options in selecting residential resettlement sites: (i) for areas where only several \nhouseholds are involved in house relocation (light impact), the new housing sites  can be \nselected in the same village/community; (ii) for a village with  more households involved in \nrelocation, but with enough land for their livelihoods (intermediate impact), a site with existing or \nnew apartment buildings  can be selected, considering farmers\u2019 production and operational \nconvenience;  or  (iii)  for  a  village  with  a  serious  relocation  impact,  a  separate  village \nrehabilitation plan was formulated, for which final site selection will be determined once the \nproject feasibility study is approved. For the relocated enterprises, new sites will be planned by \nthe Xi\u2019an Municipal Planning Commission. Each enterprise will be responsible for reemploying \nstaff and contract workers, and will be assisted with subsidies where necessary. \n \n8.  There  will  be  few  opportunities  for  agricultural  development  because  urbanization \npressure in the project area is already strong, except in places such a Chang\u2019An ancient city \nwhere investment will be made for vegetable gardening and animal husbandry. Fortunately, \ncommercial  and  industrial  opportunities  near  the  new  ring  road  will  improve  significantly. \nProposed income rehabilitation measures are as follows: (i) provide employment opportunities \nin new commercial and industrial enterprises, (ii) establish collective  enterprises, (iii) open \nprivate shops and businesses, (iv) rent land and housing, and (v) provide subsidies and social \nsecurity system for vulnerable groups and poor households. Within each category, detailed \nneeds for farmers to expand their working skills will be identified, and relevant training will be \nplanned. For vulnerable groups, the Project will provide a special social assistance fund to help \neach household restore its livelihood. \n \n ", "58 Appendix 15 \nE.  Implementation Framework and Budget \n \n9.  On behalf of the Xi\u2019an municipal government, the Xi\u2019an Municipal Urban and Rural \nConstruction  Commission  (XMURCC)  will  be  responsible  for  general  administration  and \ncoordination of the Project. The leading group and a permanent office were established to \ncoordinate interagency responsibilities. A land acquisition and resettlement department within \nthe Project Company was established, and experienced staff were recruited. This department \nwill supervise and assist the local government offices that will implement land acquisition, \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  and  resolving  grievances.  Resettlement \ncoordination offices were established in each affected district and several wards. Each affected \nvillage will appoint at least one person as a member of the ward office to assist with preparing \nand implementing relocation and economic rehabilitation plans. Each village or neighborhood \ncommittee will be actively involved with implementing resettlement. \n \n10.  In July 2003, the Xi\u2019an municipal government approved the compensation standards for \nthe  Project.  Detailed  impact  investigations  have  been  completed  and  provide  accurate \nquantities for the cost estimate. Based on the compensation rates, and the estimated impacts \nbased on preliminary design data, the budget for land acquisition and resettlement is estimated \nat $180.5 million equivalent, excluding contingencies. This is relatively high because of the \nlocation of the ring road in the relatively densely populated suburban area. Most of the land is \nowned by rural collectives, and hence the land compensation needs to be paid at a high \naverage rate of CNY25,000 per 0.067 hectare in addition to relocation costs for residences and \nenterprises.  \n \n11.  The Project Company will establish a system for internal monitoring of land acquisition \nand resettlement to guarantee timely and adequate land acquisition and resettlement works in \naccordance with the RP and to ensure the entitlements of the AP are fully met. The Project \nCompany will summarize resettlement progress in the quarterly reports it submits to ADB. At \nmidterm and at project completion, the Project Company will submit resettlement evaluation \nreports to ADB that summarize achievements, outstanding issues, and remedial measures. \nEach year, the XMURCC will submit to ADB a summary of the annual resettlement audit of \ndisbursements and expenditures, prepared by the Xi\u2019an Municipal Audit Bureau. Resettlement \nsupervision milestones have been agreed upon (Table A15.3). \n \n12.  The Project Company will hire an independent institute for external monitoring and \nevaluation  of  resettlement. The tasks  follow:  (i)  prepare  the  baseline  data,  (ii)  verify the \nadequacy  and  timeliness  of  compensation  payments,  (iii)  assess  economic  rehabilitation \nmeasures and adequacy of the budget, (iv) assess the quality of new house construction and \ntimely transfer, (v) appraise the effectiveness of the grievance procedure, (vi) collect opinions \nand level of satisfaction of APs, (vii)  assess the efficiency and effectiveness of agencies \nresponsible for resettlement, (viii) survey households to assess whether they have restored or \nimproved  their  living  conditions  and  income  levels,  and  (ix)  assess  the  rehabilitation  of \nenterprises and redeployment of staff and contract workers. External monitoring will be carried \nout every  6 months in the first  2 years, and then annually  for 2\u20133 years.  Monitoring and \nevaluation reports will be submitted to the Project Company and ADB. \n ", "Appendix 15  59\nTable A15.2: Entitlement Matrix \n \nEntitled Person/ \nType of Loss  Application   Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues \nGroup \nPermanent loss of  Arable land located  Land-owning groups   Land compensation and  Village meetings will decide \narable land  in the ROW of the    resettlement subsidies,  the allocation of funds, the \n3rd ring road and  Farmers who use  respectively  redistribution of land, and \ninterconnector  the land  investment in income-\nReplacement land and/or \nroads    generating activities.  \ncash payments and/or \n     \nincome restoration measures  \n  Higher level authorities will \n  Cash compensation for trees  approve and monitor village- \n  (based on type, age, and  level proposals and facilitate \n  diameter) and standing crops  urban transfers and training \n  programs. \nTemporary loss of  Land adjacent to  Farmers who use  Cash compensation based on  Village committee/farm \narable land  ROW for  the land  AAOV for each year land is  owners must be notified in \nconstruction  not available + reinstatement  advance and paid \npurposes  to preconstruction condition  accordingly. \nForestland  Forestland within  Local forest bureau   Cash compensation to forest  The forest bureau will \nROW  bureau according to  construct greenbelts.  \nstandards and regulation of \nShaanxi provincial laws \nLoss of residential  Residential land  Rural land-owning  New plot provided by the  Village and AP will decide \nland  located in or  collectives  village committee, which  on location of new \naffected by ROW    receives compensation from  residential plots. \n  the Project   \n   \nNew apartments for urban \ntransfer must be ready \nbefore relocation. \nLoss of residential  Housing located in  Owner of rural  Cash compensation at  Farmers will reconstruct new \nhouse and assets  or affected by ROW  houses  replacement rates for all  houses on the plots \n  buildings.
