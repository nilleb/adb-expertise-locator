An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, \nand  the  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Board and  made public \nthrough the web site of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 27 \nMay 2003. \n\n \nProject Description \n\nThe Project is located in  Xi\u2019an municipality, the capital of Shaanxi \nProvince  and a key growth pole  in the poor western region of the \nPRC.  In  Xi\u2019an,  the  urban  population  increased  from  2.3  million \n(37.3%  of  total)  in  1990  to  3.0  million  (42.7%)  in  2002.  Rapid \nurbanization  in  Xi\u2019an  has  put  pressure  on  the  urban  transport \nsystem, resulting in traffic congestion and increasing motor vehicle \nemission.  The Project will support the Government\u2019s  development \nstrategy by improving the urban transport system by (i) constructing \nan  urban  ring  road;  (ii)  improving  connector  roads ;  (iii) providing \nurban transport facilities and services; and (iv) providing consulting \nservices and training to enhance construction quality,  road safety, \nvehicle emission control, and project monitoring and evaluation.  \n\nConsistent  with  the  Xi\u2019an  master  plan,  large  investments  are \nprogrammed  for  road  construction,  a  subway  system,  and  public \ntransport operations. Clear and realistic priorities need to be set for \nfuture  urban  development.  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  are \nneeded  in urban transport policy and regulations, public transport, \ntraffic management and safety, road maintenance, vehicle emission \ncontrol,  driver  education,  urban  poverty  reduction,  and  private \nthe \nsector  development.  The  master  plan  gives  priority \nconstruction of the third ring road, which will form the main physical \ncomponent  of  the  Project.  Construction  of  a  ring  road  and \nconnector  roads  will  provide  efficient  and  safe  access  within  the \ncity, and for inbound and outbound traffic. The Project will address \nthe  growing  traffic  congestion  caused  by  the  rapid  increase  in \ntraffic, inadequate road infrastructure, and poor traffic management. \nThe Project has been designed as a public service project because \npeople in the urban area  will all benefit from the Project directly or \nindirectly through reduced congestion in the urban road network as \na  whole.  The  project  road  users,  therefore,  will  not  be  directly \ncharged for its use. Xi\u2019an municipality has identified the Project as a \npriority investment, which will also complement ADB\u2019s assistance in \ndeveloping the  Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan section of the national trunk highway \nsystem. \n\nto \n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  economic \ngrowth in Xi\u2019an by reducing transport costs and relieving transport \ninfrastructure  bottlenecks.  The  Project  will  help  develop  an \nefficient,  safe,  and  environmentally  sustainable  urban  transport \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n\fsystem by (i) strengthening institutional capacity through improved \ncoordination among municipal government agencies; (ii) improving \ntraffic  management  and  safety,  (iii)  improving  vehicle  emission \ncontrol,  and  (iv)  increasing  the  capacity  of  urban  roads.  The \nProject comprises the following com ponents: (i) constructing a 71-\nkilometer  (km)  ring  road,  including  interchanges  and  bridges; (ii) \nupgrading and constructing 16 km of connector roads to integrate \nthe  ring  road  with  the  overall  urban  road  network;  (iii)  improving \nfive  areas  of  urban  transport\u2014traffic  management  and  safety, \nvehicle emission control, public transport, urban transport planning, \nand  road  maintenance;  (iv)  procuring  equipment \nfor  road \nmaintenance, transport planning modeling, traffic signals and area \ntraffic  control  center,  vehicle  emission  inspection,  vehicle  axle \nweighing  system,  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG) filling stations, \nand  surveillance  and  communications;  (v)  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement;  and  (vi)  consulting  services \nfor  construction \nsupervision,  urban \ntransport  component,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and capacity building. \n\nThe total cost of the Project is $762 million equivalent, comprising \n$296  million  (39%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $466  million \nequivalent (61%) in local currency. \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nXi\u2019an Municipal Government \n\nTotal \n% \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n270 \n26 \n296 \n39 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n0 \n466 \n466 \n61 \n\nTotal \nCost \n270 \n492 \n762 \n100 \n\n   \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $270 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years \nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of  0.5% \n(the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n\nlending \n\n \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by  the  Government \nto  the  Shaanxi  provincial  government (SPG), which will relend  to \nTerms \nXi\u2019an  municipal  government  (XMG)  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.

Civil works for \nthe project roads will be procured through international competitive \nbidding.  On  22  July  2003,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for \nprocuring  civil  works.  Equipment  will  be  procured \nthrough \ninternational competitive bidding or international shopping. \n\n(vi)  assist \n\nAbout  51  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will \nbe  provided  to  (i)  support  project  management  during  the \nconstruction period; (ii) conduct a safety audit of the project design \nand completed construction works; (iii) help set up and implement \nquality control procedures; (iv) develop capacity in road safety and \nvehicle emissions, and prepare action plans for Xi\u2019an municipality; \n(v)  prepare  a  procedural  manual  for  good  management  of  the \nProject  Company; \nformulating  a  capacity \ndevelopment  program;  (vii)  carry  out  environmental  monitoring; \nand  (viii)  help  establish  and  implement  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system,  including  assessing  the  impact  on  poverty \nreduction.  About  3,000  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  required \nfor  construction  supervision.  The \ninternational consultants will  be financed  from the  ADB loan  and \nrecruited  based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the Use of Consultants. \nThe domestic consultants will be financed by the Project Company \nand  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nin \n\ninvestments,  enhance \n\nBy  improving  urban  transport  facilities  and   traffic  management,   \nthe Project will help establish an efficient, safe, and environmentally \nsustainable  urban  transport  system  in  Xi\u2019an  municipality. This will \nhelp  promote \nincomes,  and  create \nemployment  opportunities.  The  economic  internal rate of return is \nestimated at 15.4%. About 3 million people live in the project area: \n1.9 million in  the  urban  area,  and  1.1  million  in  rural  areas. The \nlow-income  population  includes  4.2%  of  urban  residents  earning \nless  than  CNY3,000  per  capita  per  annum  and  8.0%  of  rural \nresidents earning less than CNY1,000 per capita per annum. The \ninclude  construction  employment \nProject\u2019s  direct \nopportunities,  savings \nin \ntravel \npassenger  transport.  Indirect  benefits  include  accelerating  the \nurbanization process, which provides the potential for households \n\ntime,  and  cost  savings \n\nimpacts \nin \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nto diversify and increase employment opportunities and incomes. \nHousehold  poverty  and  vulnerability  are  reduced  with  multiple \nincome earners. \n\nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce  potential  technical, \neconomic,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The  main  potential  risks, \nwhich  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns, \nare  associated  with  the  unexplored  archeological  sites  that  may \nbe discovered during excavation, given the historical nature of the \nproject area.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  a  special  advisory  team  will \ntake  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  XMURCC  has  proven \nexperience in dealing with this situation. Given the magnitude  and \ncomplexity  of  land  acquisition  and  displacement  of  houses  and \nenterprises,  there  are  potential  risks  that  land  acquisition  may \ndelay  construction  activities  or  that  resettlement  implementation \nmay  not  fully  restore  all  livelihoods.  These  risks  have  been \nmitigated  by  a  carefully  prepared  detailed  implementation  plan, \ncompensation  standards,  budget,  and  schedule  managed by  the \nProject  Company\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement department \nand monitored by an independent institute. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  (RRP)  on  a \n\n \n1. \nproposed loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nPRC\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth  has  been  accompanied  by  urbanization,  with  the urban \npopulation increasing from 300 million (26.4% of total) in 1990 to 502 million (39.1%) in 2001. \nThis urbanization trend  is forecast to  continue, with the urban population reaching  832 million \n(54.5%)  in  2025.  Increased  incomes  and  prosperity  have  made  cars  affordable  to  a  growing \nsegment  of  the  population,  the  emerging  middle  class.  Vehicle  ownership  is  projected  to \nincrease  from  18  per  1,000  people  in  2000  by  a  factor  of  more  than  five  in  2020.  In  Xi\u2019an \nmunicipality  the  urban  population  increased  from  2.3  million  (37.3%  of  total)  in  1990  to  3.0 \nmillion  (42.7%)  in  2002.  This  has  put  increasing  pressure  on  the  urban  transport  system. \nBetween 1990 and 2001, when real economic growth averaged 10.4% per annum, road traffic \ngrew at 15.7% per annum for passenger traffic, reaching  4.5 billion passenger-kilometers (km); \nand  10.1%  per  annum  for  freight,  reaching  4.0  billion  ton-km.  Movement  of  goods  and \npassengers  will  increasingly  be  by  road,  as  road  transport  is  more  flexible  and  responsive  to \nneeds  in  a  market  economy  than  other  modes.  Vehicle  ownership  in  Xi \u2019an  grew  from  10.1 \nvehicles per 1,000 people to 23.1 during the same period. \n \nThe road network  in  Xi\u2019an  is  underdeveloped  in  both  quality  and  extent.  The  total  road \n3. \nnetwork grew from 2,852 km in 1995 to  3,298 km in 2001, equivalent to an annual increase of  74 \nkm.  The  expressway  length  increased  from  16  km  to  159  km  during  the  same  period.  High- \nstandard  roads,  i.e.,  above  class  II,  account  for  only  27%  of  the  total  road  network,  and  the \nremaining  73%  (class  III  road  and  below)  are  medium -  to  low-grade  paved  roads  and  gravel \nroads. Road density relative to  the  urban  area  decreased slightly from  5.64  km per square km \n(km2) in 1995 to  5.21 km per km2 in 2000.1 Road density relative to the population increased from \n3.13 square meters (m2)  to  3.66  m2 per capita during the same period,  which is less than the \nnational average of 5.9 m2. \n \n4. \nUrban infrastructure  development  during  the  ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  (1996\u20132000) \nreflected Xi\u2019an\u2019s commitment to stimulate the economy through public investment.  Government \ninvestments  during this period totaled CNY6.8 billion, or about CNY1.4 billion per year.  Because \nof  the  need  to  lower  transport  and  logistics  costs  and  remove  transport  bottlenecks,  the road \nsector  received  the  largest  share,  amounting  to  CNY1.9  billion  or  26%.  The  road  sector \ninvestment  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  9.4%  during  this  period,  and  in  2002  reached \nCNY1.2 billion. The project framework summarizing the main features of the proposed Project is \nin Appendix 1.  An urban transport sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nXi\u2019an  is  the  provincial  capital  and  political,  economic,  and  cultural  center  of  Shaanxi \nProvince.  Xi \u2019an  is  one  of  the  most  important  growth  poles  in  the  western  region.  Xi\u2019an \nmunicipality comprises the city (with eight districts) and five counties, with a total population of \n7.0  million.  Xi\u2019an\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  CNY82.4  billion  in  2002,  up  by  13.5% \nfrom 2001. The GDP is expected to grow  by 12.4% per year, reaching  CNY117 billion by 2005. \n                                                 \n1 This is due to reclassification of urban areas in 1999, which increased from 162 km 2 to 187 km 2. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n\f 2\n\nThe average annual per capita income for urban residents was CNY7,184, slightly less than the \nnational  average  of  CNY7,703.  For  rural  residents  income  per  capita  was  CNY2,641, slightly \nmore  than  the  national  average  of  CNY2,476.  The  income  levels  are  forecast  to increase to \nCNY8,864 and CNY3,500, respectively, by 2005.  \n \n6. \nThe city is located at the junction of two major highways and two major railways. Around \nthis  transport  hub,  the  city  has  developed  into  an  important  industrial  and  commercial  center \nwith  many  high-tech  industries,  including  electronics,  machinery,  and  pharmaceuticals;  and \nservice  sectors,  such  as  information  technology,  finance,  and  insurance.  The  state-level  Xi\u2019an \nEconomic  Development  Zone  was  established  in  1988  to  attract  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestment.  So  far,  20  km2  has  been  developed  at  a  cost  of  CNY4.1  billion  for  infrastructure. \nThe  872  enterprises  in  the  zone  have  a  total  investment  of  CNY38  billion.  Inadequate  road \ninfrastructure, however, is a major constraint on investment by the private sector.  Many foreign \ncompanies  will  not  invest  in  the  interior  provinces  because  of  weak  infrastructure.  An  ADB- \nsupported survey 2  of domestic firms in Xi\u2019an cited poor roads as the most serious infrastructure \nconstraint. \n \n7. \nThe  present  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  services  cannot  meet  the  increasing \ntraffic  demand  in  Xi\u2019an.  The  incomplete  road  network,  low  standard  of  transport  infrastructure, \nlow  flow  capacity  at  surface  intersections,  and  slow  vehicle  speeds  contribute  to  traffic \ncongestion, traffic accidents, and increased vehicle emissions. The main causes of urban traffic \ncongestion are (i) inadequate road infrastructure facilities and services\u2014road density is low and \ncapacity  has  already  been  reached;  (ii)  poor  management  and  maintenance  of  urban  roads\u2014\nthe existing road space is not efficiently used due to inadequate traffic management and road \nmaintenance; (iii) poor public transport services\u2014development is hindered by  lack of capacity, \nslow  operating  speeds,  and  outdated  equipment  and  management  practices;  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  weakness\u2014inadequate  coordination  between  multiple  agencies  responsible  for \nurban transport policy, planning, regulations, and operations. The consequent impacts on urban \ntraffic  congestion  include  (i)  increased  transport  costs  comprising  vehicle  operating  costs \n(VOCs) and time; (ii) increasing air pollution due to vehicle emissions that pose health threats to \nurban residents; and (iii) increasing number and severity of road accidents due to poor driving \npractices, large traffic volumes, and narrow roads. \n \nA  national  symposium,  jointly  sponsored  by  ADB 3  and  the  World  Bank  in  Beijing  in \n8. \nNovember  1995,  discussed  the  PRC\u2019s  urban  transport  development  strategy  and  developed \nprinciples,  criteria,  and  actions. 4  Five  principles  were  formulated  to  guide  urban  transport \nplanning  and  operations:  (i)  transport  is  about  moving  people  and  goods,  not  vehicles;  (ii) \ntransport  prices  should  reflect  full  social  costs; (iii) transport reforms should deepen to  follow \nmarket principles to increase efficiency; (iv) the government\u2019s role should be to guide transport \ndevelopment;  and  (v)  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  providing  transport  services  should  be \nencouraged. In line with these  principles, the following criteria were  adopted for urban transport \npolicies  and  plans:  environmental  sustainability,  economic  viability,  financial  affordability,  and \nsocial  acceptability.  Consistent  with \nthese  principles  and  criteria,  eight  actions  were \nrecommended:  (i)  reform  urban  transport  administration,  (ii)  upgrade  the  status  of  traffic \nmanagement,  (iii)  prepare  a  strategy  to  mitigate  motor  vehicle  air  and  noise  pollution,  (iv) \ndevelop policies to manage traffic demand, (v) develop a strategy for mass transit, (vi) reform \npublic transport management and operations, (vii) develop a financing strategy for the transport \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2002.

Some of \nthe recommendations are being implemented in selected cities,5 with some success. \n \n9. \nThe  development  of  Xi\u2019an  is  guided  by  the  Master  Plan:  1995-2010, which sets out a \nbroad policy on land use and development, and transport infrastructure that will conserve Xi\u2019an\u2019s \nunique character, historical legacy, and environment. The  master plan was updated to take into \naccount  the  significant  changes  forecast  for  the  next  decade.    It  provides  a  good  basis  for \nplanning  urban  transport  development,  including  public  transport.  Urbanization  and  rapid \neconomic growth are forecast to continue  throughout the period. A large increase in office and \ncommercial activities  is  forecast and  will  be  located  centrally.  To  provide  the required space, \nmajor redevelopment is planned in and adjacent to the city center. In  the master plan, the Xi\u2019an \nurban area will be supported by 11 peripheral satellite towns that will be home to Xi\u2019an\u2019s growing \npopulation, industry relocated from the inner city, and new industrial developments. \n \n10. \nFor  three  reasons,  good  transport  planning  is  central  to  implementing the  master  plan. \nFirst, because the demand for road space is growing much more rapidly than the supply, there \nare prospects for increased levels of traffic congestion that afflict many large Asian cities. Traffic \ncongestion has direct adverse impacts on the productivity and economic performance of cities, \nand  the  life  styles  of  urban  residents.  Second,  because  transport  systems  fundamentally \ninfluence land use,  the  master  plan can only be implemented  if  it  is  supported  by  a  transport \nstrategy.  Traffic  congestion  is  already  making  Xi\u2019an\u2019s  satellite  towns  inaccessible  and  less \nattractive to people currently living in the city center. Adequate transport links to the city center \nare necessary to make these satellite towns viable. Third,  because Xi\u2019an is Shaanxi Province\u2019s \ncultural center, great importance is attached to preserving and enhancing the city environment. \nWhile  measures  are  being  taken  to  address  environmental  concerns  from  industrial  and \ncommercial  sources, 6  there  is  mounting  evidence  that  increasing  vehicle  emissions  will \nadversely  affect  the  city\u2019s  environment,  including  the  historic  core.  An  appropriate  transport \nstrategy is necessary to address the situation. \n \n11. \nThe impact of transport infrastructure investments on poverty reduction was analyzed in \na  study  that  examined  the  effectiveness  of  government  expenditure  in  various  sectors  in \ncontributing to growth and poverty reduction in the PRC. The study concluded that investments \nin road infrastructure have  a significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  productivity,  and  growth. \nThe link between transport  infrastructure  and  poverty  reduction  is  also  supported  by  studies 7 \nand  evaluation  of  completed  transport  projects  financed  by  ADB 8  and  the  World  Bank. 9 An \nongoing  TA  is  examining  the  socioeconomic impact of road investment in  the  PRC10 while a \nregional  TA11  is  being  implemented  to  review   the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  infrastructure \n                                                 \n5   For example, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Urumqi, and Shijiazhuang. \n6  ADB is helping to reduce air pollution in Xi\u2019an under ADB. 1997.

Their  preliminary  findings  show  that  road  infrastructure  stimulates  economic \ndevelopment, which helps reduce poverty. \n \n12. \nThe private sector will be the PRC\u2019s engine of job generation and the main mechanism \nto  increase  economic  productivity\u2014two  essential  developments  needed  to  reduce  poverty. 12 \nAccording  to  ADB-supported  surveys  (footnote  2),  one  of  which  was  carried  out  in  Xi\u2019an, \ninfrastructure  constraints  are  among  the  impediments  faced  by  domestic  private  companies \noperating in the PRC. Of the 756 domestic firms interviewed, 21% cited poor roads as a major \nconstraint, the second most frequently cited infrastructure constraint after land and buildings. If \nprivate investment is to be attracted to the poor interior provinces, the enabling framework and \ntransport infrastructure, among other things, need to be improved. \n \nThe Government is implementing the long-term western region development strategy, a \n13. \nkey theme of the 10th FYP (2001\u20132005), to stimulate economic development in the western part \nof the country where poverty incidence is disproportionately high. The strategy aims to reduce \ndevelopment  disparities  between  the  western  region  and  the  coastal  region.  ADB  provided \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)13  to  help  the  Government  formulate  macrolevel  policies  and  sector \nstrategies  for  the  long-term  development  of  the  western  region.  Urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment, including roads,  was  identified  as  a  priority  area  for  investment.  The proposed \nProject will support the strategy by  improving the urban transport system in Xi\u2019an, an important \ngrowth center in the western region of the PRC. \n \n14. \nExternal assistance to the  urban transport sector has come mainly from ADB, the World \nBank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) (Appendix 3). ADB provided two \nloans totaling $155 million for the urban transport projects in Shanghai in 1991 and 1992. The \nprojects supported an urban development process by  financing the  construction  of the Nanpu \nand Yangpu bridges to provide necessary transport capacity across the Huang Pu River. 14 Since \n1991, the World Bank has provided $947 million to finance eight urban transport projects. The \nprojects supported urban roads, traffic management and safety, public transport, environmental \nmanagement,  and  policy  and  institutional  development  in  selected  cities.  JBIC  has  provided \nabout  \u00a572.6  billion  to  finance  urban  transport  projects  in  Beijing,  Chongqing,  Qingdao,  and \nWuhan.  The proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s policy  dialogue.  Formulation  of  the \nProject has been coordinated with the World Bank and JBIC. \n \nC. \n \nThe policy dialogue agenda was carefully designed and discussed with the Government, \n15. \nfocusing  on  institutional  strengthening,  traffic  management  and  safety,  and  vehicle  emission \ncontrol.  The  topics  are  discussed  in  paras.16\u201318.  Details  are  in  the  analysis  of  the  urban \ntransport sector (Appendix 2). \n \n16. \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  The  urban  transport  system  in  Xi\u2019an  is  under  the \nresponsibility  of  multiple  agencies.  Its  elements \u2014formulating  policy,  planning,  design,  and \nmanaging  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  services\u2014are fragmented, and coordination across \nagencies is limited. Local technical capacity is limited and unevenly distributed between agencies. \n                                                 \n12 ADB  assisted  the  Government  through  TA  in  examining  various  options  for  private  financing  in  the  road sector. \nADB. 1997.

These bridges were essential for the development \n\nof the Pudong Area (footnote 18).  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nA multisector approach to address the broader urban transport issues in a coordinated manner is \nessential.  For  this  purpose,  on  15  November  2002,  the  Xi\u2019an  municipal  government  (XMG) \nestablished a leading group to coordinate the preparation and implementation of the Project and \nother  urban  transport  activities  in  the  city.  The  leading  group  is  chaired  by  the  mayor  and \ncomprises 20 senior officials of the municipal and district agencies concerned. The group will be \nmaintained  throughout  project  implementation  and  operation,  and  will  significantly  enhance \ninteragency coordination. \n \nTraffic Management and Safety. Road traffic management and enforcement fall under \n17. \nthe responsibility of the Public Security Bureau (PSB). The limited available road space and its \ninefficient  use  are  obvious  in  Xi \u2019an.  Conflict  between  pedestrians  and  motorists,  inadequate \nparking  service,  nonmotorized  transport  (NMT)  operations,  increased  number  and  severity  of \nroad  accidents\u2014all  contribute  to  traffic  system  inefficiencies.  Congestion  is  affecting  the \neconomic productivity of the urban area through increased travel times, higher VOC, and a high \naccident  rate.  Public  transport  efficiency  is  hindered  by  slow  operating  speeds.  The  current \nisolated  traffic  signal  regime  covering  138  intersections  is  out  of  date.  A  better area  traffic \ncontrol  (ATC)  system  is  needed  to  optimize  the  use  of  the  available  and  potential  urban  road \nnetwork  and  improve  safety.  An  efficient  traffic  management  scheme  is  also  required  to \nintegrate  transport  modes,  NMT,  pedestrian  movements,  public  transport,  parking  services, \ntravel  demand  measures,  and  priority  facilities,  particularly  at  interchanges.  A  targeted  traffic \nenforcement  program  and  an  integrated  road  safety  strategy  are  also  required.  In  light  of  the \nfindings  of  the  recently  completed  ADB-financed  TA 15  on  road  safety,  assistance  will  be \nprovided to improve traffic management and road safety under the Project. \n \nVehicle  Emission  Control. Given the concern about increasing problems with vehicle \n18. \nemissions in Asia, ADB has prepared  the Policy Guidelines for Reducing Vehicle Emissions in \nAsia.16 In Xi\u2019an, vehicle emissions pose health threats to the urban population. 17 Congestion and \ninadequate  traffic  management  make  emissions  worse.  The  PSB  and  Environment  Protection \nBureau  (EPB)  share  responsibility  for  air  quality  control,  inspection  and maintenance, annual \nvehicle testing centers, and enforcement.  Conversion to cleaner fuel is in progress; 300 buses \nand 10,000 taxies use  compressed natural gas (CNG) in Xi\u2019an. There are only 7 CNG stations, \nbut the government plans to build 50 more stations by 2005. Funding limitations and shortages \nof skills and resources are key obstacles to improved vehicle emissions control. Seven vehicle \ntesting  centers,  operated  by  the  PSB with support from the  EPB,  inspect  safety aspects and \nemission  standards.  The  Xi\u2019an  municipal  government will strengthen vehicle emission control \nunder the Project. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB. 1999.

The project cost was, \ntherefore, recovered from municipal road user charges. Other lessons include (i) the benefits of a \ncomprehensive  and  participatory  approach  to  project  preparation,  (ii)  the  benefits  of  a  planned \nand  well-coordinated  resettlement  scheme  preceded  by  adequate  consultation  with  affected \nparties  before  relocation,  and  (iii)  the  need  for  a  professional  approach  to  forecasting  traffic \ndemand.  While  these  projects  were  successful,  their  development  impact  would  have  been \ngreater if more attention had been paid to issues like traffic management, vehicle emissions, and \npublic  transport.  Their  experience  demonstrates  that  the  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  can \nhave a profound impact on urban land use. Lessons learned from other externally financed urban \ntransport projects19 in the PRC include the following: (i) coordination among agencies concerned \nwith  urban  transport planning and  implementation  needs  to  be  improved; (ii) participation of all \nagencies  with  responsibilities  for  urban  transport  is  key  to  developing  an  integrated  and \nsustainable project; and (iii) investment in urban roads needs to be complemented by improving \nother urban transport aspects, such as traffic management and safety, vehicle emission control, \nand road maintenance. These lessons are incorporated in the project design.  \n \nReviews 20  of  performance  of  completed  road  projects  concluded  that,  in  general,  all \n20. \nloans  to  the  road  sector  in  the  PRC  have  been  or are being  implemented satisfactorily. The \nproject  completion  reports  (PCRs)  prepared  for  nine  road  projects  conclude  that  six  projects 21 \nwere  generally  successful,  and  one 22  was  partly  successful.  The  project  performance  audit \nreports  (PPARs)  for  three  road  projects 23  concluded  that  the  projects  were  either  highly \nsuccessful  or  successful.  The  lessons  learned  from  previous  ADB-financed  road projects are \nreflected  in  the  project  design.  To  avoid  delayed  loan  effectiveness  due  to  delay  in  the \nprocurement  process,  a  tendering  company  was  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works \ncontractors. ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines and requirements were discussed extensively during \nappraisal.  Emphasis  was   put  on  the  need  to  (i)  strictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding \ndocuments,  (ii)  evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-approved  evaluation  criteria,  and  (iii) \nsubstantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1997.

This is mainly  due  to  inadequate \nsafety facilities and  enforcement,  as  well  as  partial  compliance  with  environmental  mitigation  measures. Remedial \nactions were subsequently taken by rectifying the infrastructure deficiencies, enforcing harsher penalties for traffic \nviolations, and implementing the environmental mitigation measures. As a result, the project was rated successful \nby the PPAR (footnote 23). \n\n23 ADB. 2000. PPAR on the Shenyang-Benxi Highway and Jilin Expressway Projects in the PRC. Manila; and ADB. \n\n2001.

The  strategy  is  designed  to  (i)  promote  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  make \nmarkets  work  more  effectively,  (iii)  protect  the  environment,  and  (iv)  promote cooperation with \nneighboring countries. An essential thrust of the strategy is to increase assistance to the  poor \ncentral and western provinces, including Shaanxi Province,  by supporting projects that facilitate \npro-poor  economic  growth.  In  the  transport  sector,  the  strategy  will  help  remove  transport \ninfrastructure  constraints  and  improve  the  urban  environment.  An  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  transport  network  is  needed  to  promote  economic  growth  and \nbenefit the poor  in urban and rural areas. Urban infrastructure, such as road transport systems \nand  public  utilities,  will  need  to  be  improved  to  cope  with  the  increasing  burden  as  a  result  of \nrapid  urbanization.  The  proposed  Project,  designed  to  remove  transport  bottlenecks  and \naddress environmental concerns in Xi\u2019an, one of the major growth centers in the western region, \nis  consistent  with  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s strategy.  The  proposed  Project  is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy,25 which supports investing in the urban sector \nbecause  of the central role urban centers  play  in  economic  growth.  Urban areas are dynamic \nengines of growth and employment creation, centers for innovation and  entrepreneurship, and \nsources of social services. \n \n22. \nConsistent  with  the  Xi\u2019an  master  plan,  large  investments  are  programmed  for  road \nconstruction,  a  subway  system,  and  public  transport  operations.  Clear  and  realistic  priorities \nneed  to  be  set  for  future  urban  development.  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  are needed  in \nurban  transport  policy  and  regulations,  public  transport,  traffic  management  and  safety,  road \nmaintenance, vehicle emission control,  driver education,  urban poverty reduction, and  private \nsector  development.  The  master plan  gives  priority  to  the  construction  of  the  third  ring  road \n(TRR)  shown  in  Map  2,  which  will  form  the  main  physical  component  of  the  Project. \nConstruction of a ring road and connector roads will provide efficient and safe access within the \ncity,  and  for  inbound  and  outbound  traffic.  The  Project  will  address  the  growing  traffic \ncongestion  caused  by  the  rapid  increase  in  traffic,  inadequate  road  infrastructure,  and  poor \ntraffic management. The Project has been designed as a public  service project because people \nin  the  urban  area  will  all  benefit  from  the  Project  directly  or  indirectly  through  reduced \ncongestion in the urban road network as a whole. The project road users, therefore, will not be \ndirectly charged for its use. Xi\u2019an municipality has identified the Project as a priority investment, \nwhich  will  also  complement  ADB\u2019s assistance  in  developing  the  Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan  section  of the \nnational trunk highway system.26 \n \n23. \nDuring the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was prepared by the First Highway Survey \nand Design Institute and it was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission \non  30  September  2003.  Chang\u2019an  University undertook an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA),  which  was  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  on  22 \nSeptember  2003,  and  the  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  Commission \n(XMURCC) prepared a resettlement plan, which was approved by the leading group (para.16) \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

The loans total $624 million. \n\n\f 8\n\non 12 September 2003. ADB provided TA27 to supplement the Government studies.  A final TA \ntripartite meeting for the Project was held from 31 March to 10 April 2003 and appraisal from 24 \nJuly to 6 August 2003. The Project was formulated based on the findings of the ADB missions, \ninformation  provided  by  the  Government,  stakeholder  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjective \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe principal objective of the Project is to promote economic growth in Xi\u2019an municipality \nby relieving transport infrastructure bottlenecks. The Project will  help develop an efficient, safe, \nand  environmentally  sustainable  urban  transport  system  by  (i)  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity  through  improved  coordination  among  municipal  government  agencies,  (ii) improving \ntraffic  management and safety, (iii)  improving vehicle emission control, and (iv)  increasing  the \ncapacity of urban roads. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe Project comprises the following components: (i) constructing a 71 km third ring road \n(TRR),28 including interchanges and bridges; (ii) upgrading and constructing 16 km of connector \nroads  to  integrate  the  ring  road  with  the  overall  urban  road  network;  (iii)  improving  urban \ntransport in four areas: traffic management and safety, vehicle emission control, public transport, \nurban transport planning, and road maintenance; (iv) procuring equipment for road maintenance, \ntransport planning modeling, traffic signals and ATC center, vehicle emission inspection, vehicle \naxle  weighing  system,  CNG  filling  stations,  and  surveillance  and  communications;  (v)  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (vi)  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  urban \ntransport  component,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  capacity  building.  As  the  project design \ninvolves integration with the existing provincial road, project preparation is being coordinated by \nthe leading group (para.16) with the relevant provincial government authorities. \n \n26. \nThe urban transport  improvement component (Appendix 4) includes (i) an  ATC system \nfor  traffic  signals,  main  control  center  and  traffic  management  scheme;  (ii)  developing  a \ncomprehensive  urban  transport  model,  and  a  bus  priority  corridor  scheme;  (iii)  a road safety \nstrategy and safety audit; (iv) building CNG filling stations, a mobile emission inspection system, \nand formulating an action plan for air quality management and vehicle emissions control; and (v) \nroad  maintenance,  maintenance  equipment,  and  developing  an  asset  management  and \nmaintenance strategy. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nSince  1991,  ADB  has  provided  about  $4.2  billion  to  finance  the  development  of  key \nintercity expressways (3,407 km), which was complemented by improvements in the associated \nlocal  road  networks  (5,516  km).  Intercity  expressways  have  promoted  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction by providing efficient and safe transport across the country.  Because of rapid \nurbanization and the resultant urban traffic congestion in urban areas, like Xi\u2019an municipality, an \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2002. TA to the PRC for Preparing the Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n28 On the northern and southern sections of the ring road, six relief lanes (three on both sides) and eight relief lanes \n(four on both sides) will be constructed, respectively, in addition to the existing North Orbital and South Orbital road \nmain lanes . On the eastern and wes tern sections, eight main lanes plus six relief lanes (three on both sides) will be \nconstructed. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nefficient,  safe,  and  environmentally  sustainable  transport  system  must be developed  in urban \ncenters. The proposed Project will  be the first integrated urban transport project in the PRC for \nADB financing since the time of the urban transport projects in Shanghai about a decade ago. \nThis Project will provide a model for other cities in improving an urban transport system. \n \n28. \nDuring  the  feasibility  study,  EIA  and  resettlement  planning,  consultations  were \nconducted  with  government  agencies,  civil  society,  and  affected  people  to  discuss  project \nalternatives,  environmental  concerns,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues,  and  economic \ndevelopment  potential.  Village  investigations  and  surveys  were  conducted  in  both  the  direct \nimpact  area  and  the  broader  beneficiary  area  to  assess  the  potential  adverse  impacts  and \nbenefits of the proposed project. Over  2,000 people were interviewed in public opinion surveys, \nsocial assessment, and resettlement planning. For resettlement planning, consultation meetings \nwere held with the affected districts, wards, and villages. The Project is well known and public \nsupport  for  it  is  high.  For  adversely  affected  people  that  expressed  concern  for  the  loss  of \nfarmland  or  housing,  the  local  officials  explained  the  policies  and  regulations  for  land \ncompensation  and  housing  removal.  These concerns  have been  considered in (i)  determining \nthe  alignment  to  reduce  social  and  environmental  impacts;  (ii)  designing  interchanges, \nconnector  roads,  and  pedestrian  access;  and  (iii)  preparing  a  detailed  resettlement  plan.  The \nconsultation  process  was  expanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  appropriate \ncompensation standards and rehabilitation measures for people displaced by land acquisition or \nhouse  demolition.  Villagers  have  participated  in  the  discussions  and  decisions  on  village \nresettlement. Appendix 5 gives details of stakeholder participation and consultation. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $762  million  equivalent,  with  $296 million \n(39%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $466  million  equivalent  (61%)  in  local  currency  (Table  1, \nAppendix 6). \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n\n \nItem \nA.

The remaining foreign exchange cost of $26 million and the local currency \ncost will be financed by XMG through cash advances and loans. The ADB loan proceeds will be \nmade available  by the Government to Shaanxi  provincial government (SPG), which will relend \nto XMG with the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan.  XMG will further onlend \nto  the  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Third  Ring  Road  Construction  and  Development  Company  (Project \nCompany)  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  XMG  will  bear  the \ninterest rate variation and foreign exchange risks of the loan. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nXMURCC will be the Executing Agency for overall management and implementation of \n32. \nthe Project. The wholly state-owned Project Company was established through issuance of the \ncompany  registration  certificate  dated  2  April  2003  for  the  purpose  of  project implementation \nand operation. The Project Company has a board of directors and sufficient technical, financial, \nand  administrative  staff  (Appendix  7).  The  general  manager  of  the  Project  Company  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of  contracts,  and  payments.  The  deputy \ngeneral  managers  will  be  responsible  for  physical  implementation  activities  on  a  day-to-day \nbasis  and  the  preparation  of  progress  reports,  assisted  by  a  team  of  qualified  engineering, \nfinancial,  resettlement,  and  administrative  staff.  A  project  administration  memorandum, \ncontaining  important  project  data  and  information,  was  prepared  during  appraisal  to  help \nXMURCC  and  the  Project  Company  monitor  project  implementation  and  evaluate  project \nimpact.  The  Project  Company\u2019s  institutional  capacity  needs  to  be  developed.  Consulting \nservices will provide assistance in this respect. A land acquisition and resettlement department \nwas established within the Project Company to ensure that appropriate agencies and authorities \ncoordinate land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be \n\n \n33. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\nimplemented \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nfrom  March  2004 \n\nto  December  2007.  The \n\n \n34. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. The  main \ncivil  works  will  be  divided  into  21  packages  to  be  procured  under  international  competitive \nbidding procedures. Equipment will be procured under either international competitive bidding or \ninternational shopping (Appendix 9). The China International Tendering Company and the China \nInstrimpex International Tendering Company, selected by the Project Company on a competitive \nbasis,  will  handle  international  competitive  bidding.  Prequalified  contractors  with  adequate \ntechnical and financial capacities will be allowed to bid for several packages and, if successful, \nmay be awarded more than one contract based on the least-cost combination of contracts.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n35. \nA  government-financed  domestic  consulting  team,  headed  by  a  chief  supervision \nengineer,  will  undertake  construction  supervision  activities  for  about  3,000  person-months of \nconsulting  services.  A  resident  site  engineer  assisted  by  a  deputy  resident  engineer  and \nsupported by technical and administrative personnel will supervise each contract package.  The \nsite  resident  engineer  will  report  to  the  chief  engineer.  The  chief  engineer  will  report  to  the \ndeputy  general  manager  responsible  for  the  engineering  department.  Additional  domestic \nconsultants  will be  engaged  for the  urban  transport  component,  environmental management \nand monitoring, resettlement monitoring and evaluation, and project performance monitoring. \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  provide  51  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to  (i) \nsupport project management during construction; (ii) conduct a safety audit of the project design \nand  completed  construction  works;  (iii)  help  set  up  and  implement  quality  control  procedures; \n(iv) help develop capacity in road safety and vehicle emissions, and prepare action plans in this \nregard; (v) prepare  a  procedural  manual  for  good  management  of  the  Project  Company; (vi) \nhelp  formulate  a  capacity  development  program;  (vii)  undertake  environmental  monitoring \nservices;  and  (viii)  establish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management  system, \nincluding  assessing  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  poor.  The  team  leader  will  be  in  the  field \nduring the entire construction period and will act as assistant chief supervision engineer to help \nthe chief engineer certify variation orders, contractor payments, and subcontracting documents, \nand  in  establishing  a  contracts  management  system.  All  consultants    financed  under  the  ADB \nloan  will  be  selected  and  engaged  based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based selection method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Well-qualified  domestic \nconsultants  experienced  in  implementing  similar  projects  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \n37. \nBecause of the high priority accorded to the Project and the need to start works in March \n2004,  ADB  approved  on  22  July  2003  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works.29 Advance \naction  up  to  the  evaluation  of  bids,  but  not  including  award  of  contracts,  covers  the \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages. \n                                                 \n29 Advance action was reported in the July 2003 edition of ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version). \n\n\f 12\n\nThe advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe  Government  and  XMURCC  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n38. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be for large contracts well above $100,000, \ndirect  payment  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  the  loan  funds.  If \ngovernment funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement procedure will \nbe used. To expedite fund flow, statement of expenditures will apply for  reimbursing payments \nunder $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n39. \nThe  Project  Company  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  related \nfinancial  statements  and  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing \nstandards consistently applied by external auditors, whose qualifications, experience, and terms \nof reference are acceptable to ADB. The Project Company will submit to ADB within 9 months of \nthe  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report  on the Project, all in the English language. The Government \nis  aware  of  its  stringent  requirements  for  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements.  To  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  checks  on  the  project construction \ncosts and operations are effective,  the Project Company has established, at ADB\u2019s suggestion, \nan internal audit unit and will maintain it  during project implementation and operation. The unit, \ncomprising  three  accountants,  will  examine  day-to-day  transactions  before  referring  them  to \nexternal auditors. \n \nThe Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting implementation \n40. \nprogress  through  quarterly  progress  reports.  Within  3  months  of  completion,  the  Project \nCompany will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n41. \nA set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \noutputs,  and  conditions  was  discussed  with  the  Project  Company.  The  indicators  will  be \nreviewed at the start of project implementation and may include (i) economic development and \nsocioeconomic indicators for Xi\u2019an, (ii) transport costs and time for specific types of vehicles and \ntrips, (iii) transport services and transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) income levels, and (vi) \njobs  created  in  construction  and  maintenance.  Some  of  these  are  included  in  the  Project \nframework (Appendix 1).  At the beginning of project implementation, the Project Company will \nestablish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at \nproject inception, completion, and 3 years later, and results compared with the baseline. Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  The  Project  Company  will  recruit  a \nqualified  consultant  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation system, and train the staff of  the Project Company and other implementing agencies \nin  its  use.  The  main  sources  of  data  will  be  (i)  secondary  data  from  government  sources,  (ii) \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  and  (iii)  participatory  rapid  appraisal.  Reports  summarizing  the  key \nfindings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later will be submitted to ADB.  \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n13\n\nin  2005,  covering  all \n\n \nADB, SPG,  XMURCC, and the Project Company will carry out a midterm review of the \n42. \nProject \ntechnical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \nThe  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  policy  development,  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards, and compliance with assurances in the loan and project agreements. \n \n\ninstitutional,  administrative,  organizational, \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n43. \nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local \ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the \nneed  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of \nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and \ncorruption are discovered.  \n \n44. \nBased on XMURCC\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions have been \ntaken: (i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection Bureau will be resident in project offices for \nbidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii)  a  supervisory  board  has  been  established  in  the \nProject  Company;  (iii)  a  two-contract  system  has  been  established  where  the  winner  of  a  civil \nworks contract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; (iv) liaison meetings \nbetween  XMURCC  and  the  Prosecutor's  Office  are  held  regularly  and  warnings  about  or \ninformation on corrupt practices are discussed; and (v)  periodic inspections of contractors have \nbeen instituted to ensure that procedures related to fund withdrawals and settlements are being \nfollowed. \n \n\n11. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n \n45. \nTo  cope  with  its  increased  infrastructure  construction  and  management  activities,  the \nProject  Company  needs  to  develop  and  implement  a  human  resource  development  plan  with \nthe  help  of  international  and  domestic  consultants.  The  plan  will  consider  the  needs,  and  the \nrecruitment and training requirements identified. One element of the plan will be an international \ntraining program  for  170  person-months  financed  under  the  loan.  It  will  cover  urban  transport \noperations, road maintenance and asset management, road safety, transport planning, vehicle \ninfrastructure  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nemissions,  project  management, \nevaluation,  environmental  management,  traffic  management,  quality  control,  bridge  and  road \ndesign, and commercial road development. With the assistance of the international consultants, \nthe XMURCC will prepare for ADB's concurrence a program of training activities, their location, \nand a list of candidates. Findings from the training will be disseminated through  XMURCC and \nthe Project Company. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n46. \nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  the  potential  risks \nassociated with the Project. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs and net \nbenefits will accrue to the project area. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 14\n\nTraffic Forecasts \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nA. \n \n47. \nTraffic was modeled over the entire affected  road network, with and without the Project, \nto  determine  the  impact  of  the  additional  road  capacity  on  road  user  costs  in  terms  of  travel \ntime, VOCs, and accidents. Vehicle trips were assigned to the Xi\u2019an internal and external road \nnetwork  using  a  matrix  of  88  zones  within  the  TRR  and  24  zones  outside  the  TRR.  The  road \nnetwork  comprises  about  3,000  links  in  2008  and  4,850  links  in  2028.  Based  on  the  ADB-\nfinanced  TA  (footnote  27),  the  forecast  traffic  volume  on  the  TRR  is  expected  to  grow  from \n14,500\u201348,500  passenger  car  units  (pcu)  per  day  in  2008,  depending  on  the  link, to  41,700\u2013\n72,000 pcu in 2018, equivalent to annual growth rates ranging between 3.5% and 11.7%. Traffic \nwill grow more slowly at 4.6%\u20138.2% per annum thereafter to reach 88,800\u2013146,000 pcu in 2028 \n(Appendix  11 and Supplementary Appendix  A). The projected volumes can be accommodated \nin the TRR and justify the construction of the Project. \n \nB. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \n48. \nwithout-project  situations.  The Project  will  provide  relief  for  the  increasingly  congested  central \narea of Xi\u2019an, and the connector roads will improve the distribution of traffic between the second \nring road and the  Project. Access from the poorer outer areas of the municipality and from nine \nsatellite  towns  to  Xi\u2019an\u2019s  relatively  developed  central  area  will  improve.  The  investment will \nfacilitate commercial and industrial development in adjacent areas. \n \n49. \nThe economic costs of the  Project reflect the resource costs for construction, operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M),  and  the  value  of  agricultural  production  from  land  lost permanently. \nThe economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs as a result of improved traffic conditions, (ii) \npassenger  time savings,  and  (iii)  savings  from  avoided  physical  damage  as  a  result  of  fewer \naccidents. Environmental benefits will result from avoided vehicular emissions as a result of the \nreduced  level  of  congestion  on  the  urban  road  network.  However,  these  benefits  were  not \nincluded in the economic analysis because an established methodology for their valuation is not \navailable. \n \nThe  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  15.4%,  indicating  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable \n50. \n(Appendix  12). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% reduction in  benefits, do not significantly \nimpact economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 44% over the estimate for \nthe EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by  30% \nto achieve the same effect. In light of previous experience in the PRC road sector, variations of \nsuch magnitude are unlikely. \n \nC. \n \n51. \nXMURCC  is  responsible  for  providing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  services, \nincluding  urban  roads,  water  supply,  city  sewage  services,  central  heating,  gas,  wastewater \ntreatment,  and  environmental  management  and  landscaping.  The  expenditures  on  the  urban \nroads  increased at 35% per annum in the last 5 years and reached CNY1.20 billion, 64% of the \ntotal urban construction expenditures of CNY1.87 billion in 2002. During the same period, urban \ninfrastructure  maintenance  expenditures  increased  at  12%  per  annum  and  reached  CNY230 \nmillion  in  2002.  XMURCC  has  set  a  budget  of  CNY5.54  billion  for  urban  construction \nexpenditures in 2003, almost three times the level in 2002. This budget includes CNY3.2 billion \nfor  road  construction,  accounting  for  about  57%.  The  main  revenue  sources  used  to finance \nurban  construction are  central  and  provincial  government  grants  (4%);  municipal  taxes, land \n\nMunicipal Infrastructure Finance \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nImpact on Poverty \n\ntransfer  fees,  and  water  fees  (21%);  local  policy  income  (7%);  project  financing  from  other \nsources (19%); self-raised funds (17%); domestic bank loans (27%); and foreign financing (5%). \nDetails  are  in  Appendix  13.  It is currently proposed  that  the cost of the Project  be  recovered \nthrough  these  municipal  government  revenues.  XMG  will  provide  sufficient  budget  from  its \nsources to  cover  the  O&M  costs 30 and  service  debt.  The  EA  will  review  alternative  revenue \nsources from the municipal government revenue and submit its proposal to ADB by the time of \nthe midterm review of the Project. \n \nD. \n \n52. \nKey issues identified in the initial poverty and social assessment  undertaken  during TA \nfact-finding  were  assessed  in  more  detail  during  the  poverty  reduction  and  social  analysis \ncarried out under the TA (Appendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix B). The key issues related \nto resettlement and impacts on the poor. The broader trends in the project area as well as the \nneeds of affected people and their ability to  benefit from the Project were also examined. There \nare 3 million people in the project area: 1.9 million in  the urban area of Xi\u2019an municipality, and \n1.1  million  in  the  rural area.  The  lower-income  vulnerable  groups include  4.2% of  the  urban \nresidents  earning  less  than  CNY3,000  per  capita  per  annum  and 8.0% of  the  rural residents \nearning less than CNY1,000 per capita per annum. \n \nThe Project will have both direct and indirect impacts on  the poor. Direct impacts will be \n53. \nthrough construction employment opportunities, savings in travel time, and the potential for VOC \nsavings in public transport for passengers to be passed on to passengers. Indirect benefits will \nbe  from  the  urbanization  process  that  will  be  facilitated  by  the  TRR,  which  provides  the \nopportunity  for  households  to  diversify  and  increase  employment  opportunities  and  incomes. \nHousehold poverty and vulnerability will be reduced with multiple income earners per household \nand more than one source of income. Rural households with nonagricultural income are better \noff  than  households  that  rely  only  on  farming  (cropping  or  livestock)  income.  The  Project  will \nprovide  indirect  benefits  through  the  urbanization  process,  such  as  new  housing,  improved \naccess to social services, and employment opportunities. \n \n54. \nThe  Project  does  not  adversely  affect  or  significantly  impact  the  livelihoods  of  ethnic \nminorities  and  is  gender  neutral  in  adverse  impacts  and  benefits. The  Project includes some \nsocial  development  actions  to enhance benefits for  the  poor,  women, and  vulnerable groups \n(Appendix 14). \n \nE. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  The  EIA  concluded  that  no  major \nadverse environmental impacts will result, provided the recommended mitigation measures are \nimplemented.  The  TA  consultants  and  field  visits  by  ADB  staff  confirmed  the  EIA  conclusion. \nThe  summary  EIA  for  the  Project  was  circulated  to  the  Board  and  disclosed  to  the  public \nthrough ADB\u2019s web site on 27 May 2003. In addition to following ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  all  applicable  PRC  laws  and  regulations  will  be \ncomplied  with  during  implementation  and  operation.  To  ensure  that  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  of  project  construction  and  operation  are  minimized,  the  environmental \nmonitoring program and mitigation measures, as specified in the EIA, will be incorporated in the \nengineering  design,  contract  documents,  and  budget  allocation \nimplementation. \nEnvironmental  impacts  during  construction  include  generation  of  dust  during  earthwork,  noise \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Assessment \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n30 The  O&M  cost  of  the  Project  will  be  sourced  from  the  infrastructure maintenance  budget  of  XMURCC, which is \n\nprojected to reach CNY870 million in 2005. The Project\u2019s impact on the budget is small. \n\n\f 16\n\nResettlement Impacts and Plan \n\nand  exhaust  emissions  from  construction  equipment,  potential  contamination  of  surface  water \nand  groundwater  with  construction-generated  wastes,  and  conversion  of  agricultural  land  to \nroads.  An  environmental  impact  during  operations  is  a  possible  increase  in  vehicle  emissions \ndue  to  increased  traffic  volume;  however,  the  emission  per  vehicle  will  decline  with  smoother \ntraffic. Mitigating measures include application of good engineering practices (e.g., water spray \nto suppress dust, enforcing standards of construction equipment noise and exhaust emissions), \nconstructing  storm  water  retention  basins,  and  replanting  to  offset  lost  agricultural  land. \nXMURCC is planning and  implementing a broad spectrum of traffic management and transport \nsector  projects\u2014expanded  use  of  cleaner  fuels  and  more  stringent  vehicle  emissions \nstandards\u2014that will reduce transport-related pollution intensities. \n \n56. \nGiven Xi\u2019an\u2019s historical  legacy and a large number of historical treasures, there may be \nunexplored  archeological  sites  in  the  project  area.  If  archeological  sites  are  discovered,  any \nimpact  on  them  will  be  minimized  by  standardized  procedures. 31  Following  the  Law  of \nArcheology  and  Antiquity,  (i)  an  advisory  team  consisting  of  officials  from  XMURCC  and  the \nProject Company, the local cultural bureau, contractor, university academics, and archeologists \nas  necessary  will  inspect  the  site  before  construction  starts;  (ii)  the  advisory  team will identify \nartifacts  that  might  be  unearthed,  and  propose  their  proper  care;  and  (iii)  any  artifacts \ndiscovered will be managed according to size and significance of discovery. \n \nF. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  have  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Income \nrestoration  and  rehabilitation  for  both  urban  and  rural  households  are  addressed  in  the \nresettlement plan.  The  TRR  and  connector  roads  will  affect  the  Yanta,  Weiyang,  and  Baqiao \ndistricts,  including  17  wards,  and  105  administrative  villages.  The  Project  will  require  about \n1,000  ha  for  the  new  or  expanded  right-of-way,  of  which  839  ha  is  collectively  owned  land. \nAbout  1.3  million  m2  of  residential,  commercial,  institutional,  and  industrial  structures will be \ndemolished.  In  total,  29,044  persons  will  be  affected  by  project  construction:  (i)  3,394  rural \nhouseholds  with  persons  affected  by  land  acquisition  only,  (ii)  540  rural  households  with \npersons  affected  by  both  land  acquisition  and  building/house  relocation,  (iii)  2,736  urban \nhouseholds  with  persons  affected  by  building/house  relocation,  and  (iv)  151  industrial  and \ninstitutional enterprises employing 5,087 workers. \n \n58. \nA  social  impact  assessment  for  resettlement  was  conducted  based  on  feasibility  level \nplanning.  About  20%  of  affected  households  were  surveyed  and  all  105  villages  were \ninvestigated and consulted on resettlement planning.  The adverse impacts of loss of structures \nare concentrated in the urban/semi-urban areas around the 12 new interchanges. The western \nand eastern sections of the  TRR require new alignments.  The northern and southern sections \nwill  require  widening  of  the  existing  right-of-way  for  the  orbital  road,  which  helps  reduce  the \nnumber of affected people. The  three  connector  roads  mostly  follow  existing  roads  that  need \nwidening, but some sections will require new alignments, which will displace structures. \n \n59. \nThe Project Company has prepared a resettlement plan (RP), which meets ADB\u2019s policy \non involuntary resettlement and social protection strategy, as well as the relevant PRC laws and \nXi\u2019an municipal regulations. A summary RP (Appendix 15) was disclosed to the public through \n\n                                                 \n31 Similar mitigation measures were adopted in previous projects in Shaanxi Province, such as the Tongchuan-Xi\u2019an \nHighway.  The  measures  include  (i)  realigning  the  road  or  building  a  bridge  across  major  archeological  sites;  (ii) \ndocumenting, identifying, and cataloging artifacts before relocating major ones to the museum or storing those of \nminor  significance;  and  (iii)  in  case  of  very  small  and  minor  sites,  relocating  them  as  close  as  possible  to  the \noriginal site. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nRisks \n\nADB\u2019s web site on 27 May 2003.  The full RP (Supplementary Appendix  C) was also posted on \nADB\u2019s web site in November 2003. The RP includes preliminary village rehabilitation plans for \nthe  seriously  affected  areas.  The  resettlement  budget,  based  on  preliminary  design  data,  is \n$180.5  million,  excluding  contingencies.  The  Project  Company  distributed  5,000  copies  of  a \nresettlement information booklet to the affected local governments, enterprises, and households \nin  July  2003.  The  booklet  describes  resettlement  impacts,  the  resettlement  policy  and \nentitlements,  organizational  arrangements,  consultation  and  participation,  and  grievance \nprocedures.  District  and  ward  resettlement  offices  have  been  set  up  for  the  Project.  With \nguidance  from  the  Project  Company,  the  local  government  resettlement  offices  have \nparticipated  in  impact  investigations  and  have  carried  out  detailed  planning  for  compensation, \nrelocation, and economic rehabilitation after consulting with the affected people. Feedback from \nthe affected people and the public has been considered in formulating these plans. The RP also \nsets out implementation arrangements and provisions for monitoring and evaluation of progress. \nResettlement supervision milestones have been agreed upon (Appendix 15). \n \nG. \n \n60. \nThe Project  has been  formulated  to  reduce  potential  technical,  economic,  and  social \nrisks.  The  main  risks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns,  are \nassociated with the  unexplored  archeological  sites  that  may  be  discovered  during  excavation, \ngiven the historical nature of the project area.  To mitigate the risks, a special advisory team will \nprepare appropriate mitigation measures. XMURCC has proven experience in dealing with this \nkind of situation. Given the magnitude  and complexity  of  land  acquisition  and  displacement of \nhouses  and  enterprises,  there  are  potential  risks that  land  acquisition may delay construction \nactivities  or  that  resettlement  implementation  may  not  fully  restore  all  livelihoods.  These risks \nhave been minimized or will be mitigated by a carefully prepared detailed implementation plan, \ncompensation standards, budget and schedule, which are managed by the Project Company\u2019s \nland acquisition and resettlement department and monitored by an independent institute. Given \nthat, in addition to the EA, various municipal agencies such as the public security bureau and \nenvironmental  protection  bureau  are  involved  in  implementing  the  Project,  interagency \ncoordination may not be carried out as envisaged. To mitigate this risk, a leading group chaired \nby  the  mayor  and  comprising  senior  officials  of  the  local  government  has  been  established \n(para.16). \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n61. \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the relevant provincial and \nmunicipal  organizations  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the \nlegal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nInstitutional  strengthening. XMG will maintain the leading  group supported by \nits permanent office to coordinate the preparation, implementation, and operation \nof the Project and other urban transport activities in Xi\u2019an municipality. Guided by \nthe  leading  group,  XMG  will  implement  the  Urban  Transport  Sector  Policy \nReform Action Plan.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nConstruction  quality.  XMURCC  and  the  Project  Company will ensure that the \nProject  is  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  technical  standards;  and  that \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  follow \nnational  standards  and  internationally  accepted  practices.  The  international \n\n\f 18\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nconsultant  designated  as  the  team  leader-cum-assistant  chief  supervision \nengineer  will  review  and  help  certify  variation  orders  and  contractors\u2019  monthly \npayments, before the chief supervision engineer approves them. \n\nRoad safety. To ensure safe road facilities, XMURCC and the Project Company, \nwill  implement  a  road  safety  signage,  communication,  hazard  barriers,  traffic \nmonitoring, and vehicle weighing program.  XMG will ensure that XMURCC,  the \nProject  Company,  and  the  municipal  public  security  bureau  cooperate  to \nimplement the road safety measures. The public security bureau will prepare and \nstart  implementing  by  30  June  2006  the  municipal  road  safety  guidelines  and \naction plans in line with the recently approved national road transport safety law. \nBefore  opening  the  TRR,  XMURCC  in  consultation  with  the  public  security \nbureau will prepare and submit a report on the emergency response plan  for the \nTRR  to  ADB  for  review.  The  Project  Company  will  conduct  road  safety  audit \ntwice:  before  construction  and  before  opening  the  TRR  to ensure compliance \nwith safety standards. \n\nCost  recovery. XMG through XMURCC  will review alternative revenue sources \nfrom the municipal government revenue and  will discuss the availability of these \nsources with ADB during the midterm review of the Project in 2005. \n\nCorporate  governance.  The  Project  Company  will  maintain  the  internal  audit \nunit throughout project implementation and operation. \n\nChange in ownership. If (i) any change in ownership of the Project Company or \nproject facilities, or (ii) any sale, transfer, or assignment of the Project Company\u2019s \ninterest in the project  road is anticipated, the Government,  XMG, XMURCC, and \nthe Project Company will consult ADB at least 6 months before the change. The \nGovernment,  XMURCC, and  the Project Company, will ensure that any change \nin  ownership  of  the  project  facilities  is  carried  out  in  a  legal  and  transparent \nmanner. \n\n(vii)  Capacity  building.  By  31  December  2004,  XMURCC  will  prepare  a  human \nresource development plan. Before undertaking international training,  XMURCC \nwill  prepare,  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence,  (a)  a  training  plan  and  a  list  of  nominated \ncandidates,  (b)  a  program  of  workshops  to  be  delivered  by  those  trained \ninternationally, and (c) a list of training equipment and aids required to strengthen \ndomestic  training  programs.  Upon  completion  of  each  workshop,  XMURCC will \nsubmit to ADB an evaluation of the international training and the workshop. \n\n(viii)  Financial reporting. The Project Company through XMURCC will submit to ADB \naudited  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project  annually  during \nconstruction and in the first 5 years of operation. External auditors will audit such \nstatements.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  submitted \nwithin 9 months of the end of each related fiscal year.  \n\n(ix) \n\nEnvironment. XMURCC and the Project Company will ensure that the Project is \nconstructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  environmental  policies  and \nguidelines of the Government and ADB, that any adverse environmental impacts \narising from the Project are minimized by implementing the mitigation measures \nand  environmental  monitoring  program  presented \nthat \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  monitoring  program\u2014including  mitigation \n\nthe  EIA,  and \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nmeasures, and copies of permits, licenses, and clearances\u2014is regularly reported \nto ADB as specified in the EIA, including violations of safety and environmental \nstandards,  if  any,  and  their  correction.  The  Project  Company  will  ensure  that \nimpact on the archeological sites, if any, will be minimized by taking appropriate \nmeasures ,  following  the  Law  of  Archeology  and  Antiquity  and  other  relevant \nregulations. \n\nVehicle  emissions.

and coordinates \n1. \nurban  transport  development  and  management.  It  is  directly  responsible  for  formulating \nstrategies, policies, and plans for developing urban transport; drafting the annual plan and land \nuse  plan;  allocating  funds;  identifying  construction  projects and  preparing  financing  plans  for \nthose  projects;  organizing  the  implementation  of  large-  and  medium-scale  projects ; monitoring \nand  supervising  the  work  of  related  bureaus; and  licensing  and  verifying  the  qualification  of \ntransport  design  institutes  and  construction  companies.  It  coordinates  related  municipal \ngovernment  agencies  such  as  the  Planning  Commission,  Finance  Bureau,  Public  Security \nBureau, Land and Natural Resources Bureau, and Environmental Protection Bureau in  dealing \nwith investment planning, financing, pricing and fee setting,  traffic control, land acquisition, and \nenvironmental  protection.  It  also  coordinates  and  aligns  some  overlapping  work  in  planning, \nconstructing,  and  managing  among  its  subordinate  agencies,  including  the  Engineering \nAdministration Bureau, Urban Planning Bureau, and Public Utility Bureau.  \n \nB. \n \nIn 2001,  the  vehicle fleet of Xi\u2019an municipality totaled 281,732,  comprising 92,285 cars, \n2. \n4,529  buses,  28,845  small  trucks,  20,215  large  trucks,  131,346  motorcycles,  and  others.  The \ntotal  is up from 97,452 units in 1990, indicating an average annual growth rate of 10.1%. The \nnumber of cars and small trucks increased more rapidly at 11.5% and 12.5%, respectively, than \nthe  other  categories.  As  a  result,  the  market  share  of  these  two  types  of  vehicles  grew  from \n28.7% to 32.8%, and 8.1% to 10.2%,  respectively. The proportion of large trucks dropped from \n13.8% to 7.2%.  The  accession  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  in  December  2001  should  increase  investment  in  automobile  production.  The \nmodernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce unit fuel consumption \nand vehicle emissions. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nXi\u2019an municipality comprises (i) the city proper consisting of an urban area (159  square \nkilometers [km2]) and a peripheral area (69 km2), and (ii) five satellite towns: Chang\u2019an (12 km2), \nGaoling (8 km2), Huxian (13 km2), Lantian (7 km2), and Zhouzhi (7 km). The city proper is the \npolitical, economic, and cultural center, while the satellite towns have local industries, building \nmaterials,  by-products,  processing  of  minerals,  and  feed  processing.  The  total  land-use plan \narea is expected to increase to 363 km2 in 2010 and 562 km2 in 2020. Land use is divided into \nnine  purposes:  warehouses  (2.6%),  industrial  (16.7%),  residential  (29.3%),  education  and \nscientific  research  (9.3%),  commercial  (5.7%),  administrative  (2.1%),  municipal  land  (4.1%), \npublic facilities (3.5%), and others (26.7%).    \n \nD. \n \n4. \nRoad  safety  is  a  serious  issue  in  Xi\u2019an.  In  2002,  the  municipality  reported  4,114 \naccidents (58.6 per 100,000 people), 508 fatalities (7.2 per 100,000 people), and 3,214 injuries \n(45.8 per 100,000 people). The Xi\u2019an accident fatality rate is lower than the national average of \n8.3 per 100,000 people. A Road Safety Council was established to improve investigation of and \nreporting procedures for road accidents so as to devise strategies and policies to reduce road \naccidents,  and  to  improve  coordination  among  concerned  agencies.  The  function  and \n\nLand-Use Plan \n\nRoad Safety \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nVehicle Emissions Control \n\nperformance  of  the  council  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  better  serve  the  needs  of  the  city. \nImplementing  a  comprehensive  road  safety  audit  program  as  part  of  the  proposed  Project \nshould help reduce the number and severity of road accidents in the urban area of Xi\u2019an. \n \nThe  problem  of  road  safety  and  responsibility  for  improving  do  not  rest  solely  on \n5. \ngovernment  departments.  Road  safety  is  a  shared  responsibility  among  stakeholders,  central, \nprovincial and local governments; education and enforcement authorities; health care providers; \nthe media; the insurance industry; community groups and individuals who use or are affected by \nthe  road  system.  An  appropriate  road  safety  strategy  will  include  developing  safer attitudes, \nskills,  and  behavior  among  users  of  the  road  system;  improving  the  safety  of  roads,  the  road \nenvironment,  and  traffic  management;  enhancing  the  safety  of  vehicles  and  improving \noperational standards; and achieving greater community and industry awareness and ownership \nof, and participation in road safety. These dimensions are included in the proposed Project. \n \nE. \n \nAir quality in most cities is poor and vehicle emissions pose health threats to the urban \n6. \npopulation. Congestion and inadequate traffic management make emissions worse. With rapid \npopulation  growth  in  PRC  cities  and  increasing  vehicle  ownership,  air  pollution  will  worsen  if \nmitigation measures are not taken. Xi\u2019an is no exception. \n \n7. \nAlthough the transport sector contributes to pollutants in the overall air shed of Xi\u2019an, it is \ndifficult to tell how much is attributable to fixed versus mobile sources of pollution. Air pollution is \nnot monitored or predicted based on fixed or mobile sources of pollutants. Predictive models do \nnot  consider  future  vehicular  technologies,  average  travel  speeds,  and  length  of  travel.  The \nmodels  are  usually  based  on  current  technologies  and  established  fuel  sources.  A  more \neffective air quality management policy must be developed over the immediate and longer term. \n \nRegulating  vehicle  emissions  is  the  responsibility  of  local  environmental  protection \n8. \nbureaus  in  cooperation  with  the  traffic  division  of  the  public  security  bureaus.1  The  Public \nSecurity Bureau and Environmental Protection Bureau in Xi\u2019an share responsibility for air quality \ncontrol, inspection and maintenance, annual vehicle testing centers, and enforcement.  \n \nF. \n \n9. \nIn Xi\u2019an, public transport, including local and long-distance buses and taxies, is governed \nby the Xi\u2019an Municipal Transport Bureau. There are 16 providers of local bus transport services. \nMost bus transport is provided by the Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company, which operates 88% of \nthe bus routes. Established in 1979, it is a state-owned enterprise that operates 147 bus routes \nwith a total length of 2,769 km and owns 2,955 buses.  It has 13 operational units (including 8 \nsubcompanies and other 5 operational units) with 9,369 employees, and fixed asset of CNY602 \nmillion. \n \n10. \nThe  remaining  15  public  bus  transport  companies  are  relatively  small  and  mostly \nprivately or collectively owned.  Two companies operate two routes with standard buses and the \nother 13 small companies operate 16 routes with minibuses. Each subcompany or operational \nunit of the Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company has its own bus depot and maintenance plant. In the \nlast  few  years,  the  bus  fleet  has  rapidly  increased.  However,  the  number  and  capacity  of  bus \n\nPublic Transport \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Government  strengthened  the  control  of  emissions  from  motor  vehicles  by  amending  the  Air  Pollution         \n\nPrevention and Control Act in April 2000. A new chapter was added to the law to cover motor vehicle pollution. \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nNonmotorized Transport \n\ndepots have not increased at the same pace. Consequently, the existing depots are operating at \ncapacity and approximately one third of the  Xi\u2019an Public Transport Company  buses park on the \nstreet when they are not in service. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nNonmotorized transport (NMT), particularly bicycles, is an important mode of transport, \nespecially for trips to and from work. The flat topography of  Xi\u2019an renders the NMT an attractive \nmeans  of  personal  transport  although  their  use  could  be  affected  by  inclement  weather, \nespecially  ice  and  snow  in  winter.  NMT  is  pollution-free  and  provides  door-to-door  service for \nshort to medium trips. They occupy less road space than motorized vehicles and their efficiency \n(occupancy/road space required) is better than that of cars and taxis, but comparable with that \nof  a  half-full  bus.  NMT  will  continue  to  play  a  role  in the multimode transport system in  Xi\u2019an. \nThe test scheme of area traffic control intersections as part of the proposed Project should have \na positive impact on NMT in terms of travel time and improved safety. \n \nH. \n \n12. \nA policy dialogue agenda was designed and discussed with the Government. It  focuses \non  these  key  issues:  institutional  strengthening,  traffic  management  and  safety,  vehicle \nemission control, road maintenance, and urban and public transport planning. Details on these \nissues are in Table A2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fTable A2: Urban Transport Sector Policy Reform Action Plan \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nInitiative \n\nCurrent Status \n\n \n\n \n1. Institutional \n\nStrengthening \n\n \nResponsibility for \nformulating policy, \nplanning, design, and \nmanaging urban \ntransport infrastructure \nand services is \nfragmented, and \ncoordination across \nagencies is limited. \n \nLimited available road \nspace and its inefficient \nuse cause traffic \ncongestion in Xi\u2019an. \nEconomic efficiency is \naffected due to \nincreased travel time, \nhigher vehicle operating \ncosts , and high road \naccident rates. \n \n\nVehicle emissions pose \nhealth threats to the \nurban population. \n \n \n\n2.

The new system will include a \nfully equipped Area Traffic Control (ATC) Center with a capacity to handle over 250 signalized \nintersections. The center will be located in a newly built Traffic Management and Signal Control \ncomplex.  The  new  system  will  enhance  road  traffic  flow,  increase  vehicle  speed,  reduce \nintersection delay, and improve road safety on the urban roads in Xi'an. To implement the new \nATC  system,  the  PSB  will  (i)  review  existing  traffic  signal  deployment  and  its  application;  (ii) \nassess  the  benefits  and  weakness  of  the  existing  signalized  system  including  intersection \nchannelization,  signal  phasing  and  timing,  and  vehicle  and  pedestrian  delays;  (iii)  identify  the \nlocation  of  new  and  potential  ATC  intersections;  (iv)  collect  traffic  data  at  the  new  ATC \nintersections; (v) carry out a pilot study of a selected number of the new ATC intersections in a \nselected district to demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of ATC system development; (vi) \nevaluate the potential development and expansion of an ATC system to cover all intersections in \nXi\u2019an;  (vii)  assess  the  costs  and  benefits  based  on  a  study  analyzing  the  situation  before  and \nafter  implementation  of  the  ATC  system,  and  evaluation  of  car  drivers/passengers,  bus  riders, \ncyclists,  and  pedestrians;  and  (viii)  prepare  the  implementation  and  procurement  program  for \nthe ATC system.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \nThe  Project  will  improve  relevant  intersections,  considering  the  following  issues:  (i) \nimprove  staff  capability  for  applying  recognized  technical  packages  for  signalized  and \nnonsignalized intersection analysis; and (ii) prepare a comprehensive program to collect traffic \ndata, and carry out regular intersection analysis and monitoring. \n\n2. \n\nRoad Safety Audit Program \n\n \n4. \nImplementing an effective road safety audit program is an efficient  way to improve road \nsafety conditions and to reduce the number and severity of accidents. A road safety audit is a \nformal  examination  of  existing  or  future  road  conditions,  which  interacts  with  road  users.  An \nindependent,  qualified  examiner  reports  on  the  project's  accident  potential  and  safety \nperformance. A road safety audit considers all road users, including various pedestrian groups, \ncyclists,  motorcyclists,  and  operators  of  heavy  vehicles.  It  relies  heavily  on  established \nguidelines  and  standards,  and  also  on  the  ability  of  the  auditor  to  recognize  a  potentially \nhazardous combination of elements, which may not be covered by specific guidelines. The main \nreason  for  conducting  road  safety  audits  is  to  prevent  road  accidents  by  identifying  potential \nsafety problems that may require corrective action. Road safety audits seek to ensure that, as \nfar as practicable, road and traffic schemes are safe and fit for the purpose for which they are \nintended. The project roads will be subject to road safety audit during the design stage and prior \nto  opening.  The  Project  will  also  include  a  comprehensive  road  safety  audit  program  across \nXi\u2019an  by  ensuring  that  (i)  elements  that  could  cause  accidents    (e.g.,  road  furniture  near  the \nedge of traffic lanes) are not present in the road network; (ii) elements that could reduce the risk \nof road accidents (e.g., anti-skid surfacing) are included in the operational road network; and (iii) \nelements that reduce the severity of road accidents  (e.g., accident barriers) are included in the \noverall road network. \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n 5. \nOther  objectives,  which  flow  from  this,  are  to  minimize  the  risk  of  accidents  on  the \nadjacent  road  network  and  to  promote  the  importance  of  road  user  safety  when  constructing \nand operating roads.  \n\n \n3. \n\nRoad Safety Strategy \n\n \n6. \nThe Project includes the development of a comprehensive road safety strategy for Xi\u2019an, \nutilizing international consulting services. The strategy will draw on the outcome of the recently \ncompleted  ADB-financed  Technical  Assistance  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC): \nCapacity Building in Traffic Safety Planning and Management.   \n \nB. \n\nVehicle Emission Control  \n \n1. \n\nCompressed Natural Gas Stations \n\n \n7. \nThere  are  only  seven  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  stations  in  Xi'an;  two  are  used \nexclusively  by  public  transport  buses.  Many  more  are  needed.  The  Project  will  finance  the \nconstruction  of  10  new  CNG  stations,  which  will  include  civil/foundation  works,  piping, \nelectrification and CNG filling equipment.  \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3.  \n\nMobile Emission Inspection System \n\n \n8. \nOnly the Environment Protection Bureau has the capacity to carry out roadside emission \ninspection  of  vehicles  at  two  locations  at  a  time.  To  facilitate  better  emission  control  on  road \nvehicles,  a  mobile  emission  test  system  is  required.  The  Project  will  finance  a  fully  equipped \nmobile emission inspection vehicle, and some inspection units.  \n\nAction Plan  \n\n \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \nWith the help of consultants, a comprehensive quality management and vehicle emission \n9. \ncontrol action plan will be prepared under the Project. The plan will relate to existing and future \nland use and development of traffic zones. Existing and planned transport infrastructure will be \nconsidered in applying the plan. \n \nC. \n \n10.  Many  roads  in  the  urban  areas  of  Xi\u2019an  municipality  are  old  and  require  maintenance. \nExisting  road  maintenance  equipment  is  inadequate  to  maintain  the  urban  road  network  in \nacceptable  condition.  Better  maintenance  is  needed  to  reduce  road  accidents  and  to  facilitate \nsmoother traffic operations. The Project will finance equipment to implement more effective road \nmaintenance  programs  for  all  roads  in  the  urban  area,  and  will  finance  the  maintenance  of \nselected  urban  roads,  including  improvement  of  pedestrian  movements  and  nonmotorized \ntransport lanes.  \n \nD. \n\nUrban Transport Planning \n \n11. \nBecause  future  urban  transport  planning  and  design  work  depends  on  reliable  traffic \nforecasts, a comprehensive traffic forecasting and planning model should be developed for Xi'an \nmunicipality. The existing model developed by Chang'an University needs improvement to better \npredict  future  traffic  volumes  on  urban  roads  by  different  transport  modes.  A  comprehensive \ntraffic  forecasting  and  planning  model  will  be  developed.  The  Xi'an  municipal  government  will \nundertake the following actions: \n  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\nAssemble comprehensive transportation database.  Origins and destinations for \nall components of the survey will be aggregated to a detailed traffic zone system \nwithin the study area. The quality and validity of data will also be verified.  \n\nPrepare  a  transport  model  data  bank.  A  data  bank  based  on  the  software \npackage  selected  for  model  application  will  be  prepared  incorporating  the  base \nyear data required for model calibration. \n\nExpand the zone system to increase the reliability of model forecasts for strategic \nplanning  studies  and  facilitate  the  ready  integration  of  model  output  into  local \ntransport  studies  at  some  future  date.  The  number  of  zones  will  represent  an \nacceptable compromise between improved model outputs on the one hand and, \non the other hand, increased complexity, data input requirements, time required \nto  run  the  model,  and  the  effort  required  to  interpret  and  analyze  the  model \noutput. \n\nCarry out model development and calibration. The refined model system will be \nimplemented  on  any  commercial  software  with  a  suitable  user-friendly interface \nand  with  appropriate  model  procedures.  The  model  will  be  calibrated  using \naccepted  international  procedures.  The  calibrated  model  will  be  updated \nperiodically to reflect the changing travel pattern in Xi'an.  \n\n \n\nE. \n\nPublic Transport  \n \n12. \nThe Project will develop  an  action  plan  to  improve  public  transport  operations  in  Xi\u2019an, \nand  a  bus  priority  corridor  scheme.  Implementing  this  subcomponent  will  require  the  following \nsteps: \n \n\nReview existing public transport services and bus priority schemes implemented \nin other major cities in the PRC.  \n\nReview  existing  bus  routing  patterns  in  Xi\u2019an,  taking  into  consideration  future \ndevelopment and the subway. \n\nIdentify existing and future major land use and transport projects, which will have \na  major  impact  on  public  transport  travel  patterns  and  operations.  The  plan  of \nfuture public transport services will avoid direct competition with future rail mass \ntransit projects. \n\nExamine potential routes for introducing better public transport services and bus \npriority  measures.  Consider  factors  such  as  adjoining  land  uses,  right-of-way \nwidth, number and occupancy of existing bus routes, number of vehicular lanes \nand  car  volumes,  bicycle  segregation,  pedestrian  sidewalk  width,  landscape \ninstallations, cost implications, and other physical constraints. \n\nUndertake a study to estimate potential corridor traffic and ridership, travel time \nsavings, and other benefits and overall costs of implementation. \n\nEvaluate the costs and benefits of this element of the Project, considering person \nand vehicle trips. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATION \nTable A5.1: Stakeholders\u2019 Participation \n\nDate \n\nParticipants \n\nPurpose \n\nResponses/Main Issues Discussed/Concerns \n\n \n\nAgency \n\nXi\u2019an \nMunicipal \nPlanning \nInstitute \n\nJanuary \u2013 \nFebruary \n2002 \n\nFarmers, local \ngovernment/ \nagency \nrepresentatives  \n\nNo. of \nPeople \n \n\nProject proposal \npreparation \nField investigation of \nalignment \nData collection \n\nShanxi \nAcademy of \nSocial \nSciences  \n\nJuly - \nSeptember \n2002 \n\nFarmers, village \nheads, sub-\ndistrict offic ials \n\n115 \n+ \n873 \nhouseholds \n\nSocioeconomic \nsurvey  (phase 1) for \npreparation of RP \n \n\nChang\u2019an \nUniversity \n\nAugust 2002 \n\nFarmers, \npotential APs  \n\n80 \n\nTest initial perception \nof project \n \nPreparation of \nenvironmental impact \nassessment \n\nThe First \nHighway \nDesign \nInstitute \n\nOctober- \nNovember \n2002 \n\nFarmers, village \nheads, local \ngovernment \nofficials \n\n \n\nInput for project \nengineering feasibility \nstudy (FS) \n \n\nShanxi \nAcademy of \nSocial \nSciences  \n\nJanuary \u2013 \nMarch \n2003 \n\nFarmers, village \nheads, sub-\ndistrict offic ials \n\n31 \n+ \n600 \nhouseholds \n\nSocioeconomic \nsurvey  (phase 2) for \npreparation of RP \n \n\n3\n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSuggested to avoid villages/buildings if possible and use the existing roads, whenever \npossible, in alignment selection to minimize resettlement \n \nEstimated project impact \n \nCreated awareness of the proposed project \nSupported the project, and facilitated survey implementation \n \nDiscuss local attitudes to project \n \nHousehold interviews at 17 locations along the alignment \n \nConsultations with APs involving a combination of individual household interviews and PRA -\ntype surveys of village and township leaders  \n \nSocioeconomic information on affected communities \nMost respondents favored the project as defined. \n \nFavored the preferred alignment; acknowledged the poor existing traffic conditions \n \nPerceived  that  traffic  noise  and  vehicular  emissions  would  be  potentially  significant \nenvironmental problems  \n \nFavored resettlement actions, if terms were agreeable, clearly defined, and administered on \nan equitable/fair basis \n \nIndicated that they had no problems regarding the land acquisition of the project or proposed \nfuture land acquisition of areas surrounding the project \nIdentification and quantification of impacts - categories of land, structures, etc. \n \nDiscussion of design issues  \n \nSurveys involved engineers who visit the affected villages, thereby raising local awareness of \nproposed road alignment and its likely impacts. \nLocally perceived attitudes toward the roads including awareness, benefits/disbenefits, main \nconcerns  relating \nfor  methods  of \nto  compensation  resettlement,  and  preferences \ncompensation and income restoration. \n \nSuggested cash-based resettlement for those farmers with no land left; vegetable and fruit \ntree planting; and relocation nearby in same village. \n \nDeveloping tree nursery to increase land productivity \n \nCommercial land development, leasing land to increase cash income  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAgency \n\nDate \n\nParticipants \n\nPurpose \n\nResponses/Main Issues Discussed/Concerns \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. of \nPeople \n \n\n \n\nEA, IA,, TA \nconsultants \n\nJanuary \u2013 \nMarch, 2003 \n\nFarmers, village \nheads, local \nofficials \n\n \n100 + \n \n\nPreparation for \ncompensation and \nincome rehabilitation \nplan \n\nEstablish small factory to process spare parts  \n \nRedistributing house foundation land in same village for villagers to build houses for lease \n \nTechnical training for farmers \n \nSuggesting higher rates than compensation paid for Xi\u2019an orbital expressway  \nMeetings were attended by representatives from  selected villages and land-holding groups \naffected by the expressway.  \n \nThe EA and the responsible officials of each district chaired the meetings.

Trips were assigned to network links \nwith and without the project roads, for a representative peak hour (with 8.33% of daily volume) \nand  for  a  representative  off-peak  hour  (with  5.50%  of  daily  volume).  The  forecast  daily  trip \nvolumes in the assigned matrices from the base year 2003 to the final forecast year 2028 are \ngiven  in  Table  A11.1.  Trips  were  assigned  and  link  capacities  were  defined  in  terms  of \npassenger  car  units  (pcu).  The  forecast  annual  average  growth  rate  in  vehicle  trips  on  the \nnetwork during 2003-2028 is 4.8%.    \n \n\nTable A11.1:  Trip Volume on Network, 2003-2028  \n(\u2019000 per day) \n\n \n\n \n\nType of Trip \nPassenger (vehicles) \nFreight (vehicles) \nTotal (vehicles) \nTotal (pcu) \n  pcu = passenger car unit. \n  Source: Chang\u2019an University. \n\n2003 \n1,098 \n      199 \n1,297 \n1,386 \n\n2008 \n1,377 \n      264 \n1,641 \n1,912 \n\n2018 \n2,175 \n       462 \n2,637 \n3,390 \n\n2028 \n3,359 \n       788 \n4,147 \n5,571 \n\n \n2. \nThe increase in network capacity provided by the project roads benefits (i) existing traffic \nand  traffic  diverted  to  the  roads,  and  (ii)  traffic  on  other  roads  which  flows  more  freely  in  the \nabsence of the diverted traffic. To evaluate these benefits, the economic analysis is based on \nthe difference the new capacity makes to travel time and vehicle operating costs over the whole \nnetwork. The benefits per affected vehicle are higher in peak than in off-peak hours due to the \ngreater  congestion.  Total  travel  time  and  distance  traveled  per  day  in  pcu  and  the  resulting \naverage  operating  speeds  for  2008,  2018,  and  2028  are  in  Table  A11.2,  with  and  without  the \nproject  roads.  Distance  traveled  is  slightly  higher  with  the  roads  in  later  years,  but  there  is  a \nsignificant  increase  in  network  average  speed,  saving  both  passenger  time  and  vehicle \noperating costs. The annual vehicle time saving grows from 7 million hours in 2008 to 87 million \nhours in 2028, an annual average rate of increase of over 13%.  \n \n\nTable A11.2:  Impact of Project Roads on Network Performance  \n\nYear \n\nOperating Time  \n(\u2019000 pcu hours per day)  \nWith Project  Without Project \n\n \n\nDistance Run \n(million pcu km per day) \n\n  With Project  Without Project \n\n883 \n2008 \n3,027 \n2018 \n2028 \n5,523 \nkm = kilometer, pcu = passenger car unit.  \nSource: Technical assistance consultants. \n\n860 \n2,956 \n5,205 \n\n36.62 \n74.68 \n136.20 \n\n36.64 \n74.12 \n135.27 \n\n \n3. \nTraffic growth rates are generally higher on the project roads than on the network as a \nwhole.

The economic analysis covers 20 years \nof operation. Without the Project, traffic will use the existing urban road network, which will soon \nbe  congested  and  expensive  to  maintain  because  of  the  rapidly  increasing  traffic.  With  the \nProject, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on  both project roads and \nexisting roads will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nCost. Economic evaluation was undertaken using constant 2003 economic prices. The \nproject costs and benefits were revalued at economic prices by  separating the cost items into \ntradable  materials  and  equipment,  nontradable  materials,  labor,  and  land.  The  prices  were \nexpressed  in  yuan  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of \n1.08 for foreign exchange effects.  A shadow price was used to put an economic value on the \nwages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for  skilled labor since there  was no surplus of \nskilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the financial wage rate \nto an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \nBenefit.  Passenger  time  savings  account  for  57%  of  the  project benefits.  Travel time \n3. \nwas  valued  based  on  the  average  income  in  the  project  area.  The  value  of  time  over  the \nanalysis  period  was  increased  by  the  forecast  growth  in  real  per  capita  income  in  the  project \narea.

The VOCs were estimated for \neach type. The operating costs per km at speeds of 15\u201390 km per hour (kph) are given in Table \nA12.2. The traffic assignment is link flow in passenger car units (pcu). As vehicle composition by \nlink was not  available,  a  composite  curve  was  developed  representing  the  weighted  average \noperating cost at each speed, based on a representative traffic composition. The total operating \ncost for networks with and without the project roads was calculated by applying the cost curve \nequation to the modeled operating speed and traffic volume on each link. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\nTable A12.2: Vehicle Operating Costs by Operating Speed in kph \n(CNY per km) \n \nVOC at Speed in kph \n50 \n0.90 \n1.16 \n1.57 \n0.84 \n1.05 \n1.45 \n1.78 \n\n30 \n1.48 \n1.87 \n2.45 \n1.27 \n1.60 \n2.28 \n2.68 \n\n20 \n1.93 \n2.39 \n3.13 \n1.60 \n2.03 \n2.93 \n3.37 \n\n80 \n0.76 \n1.00 \n1.42 \n0.81 \n1.00 \n1.37 \n1.68 \n\n60 \n0.75 \n0.99 \n1.36 \n0.75 \n0.93 \n1.27 \n1.58 \n\n70 \n0.71 \n0.94 \n1.31 \n0.74 \n0.92 \n1.24 \n1.55 \n\n40 \n1.14 \n1.46 \n1.93 \n1.01 \n1.27 \n1.79 \n2.15 \n\n15 \n2.18 \n2.70 \n3.52 \n1.80 \n2.30 \n3.32 \n3.78 \n\n \nVehicle Type \nCar \nMedium Bus \nLarge Bus \nLight  Truck \nMedium  Truck \nHeavy  Truck \nTruck Trailer \n\n90 \n0.91 \n1.18 \n1.68 \n0.97 \n1.20 \n1.66 \n1.98 \n\n \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n           km = kilometer, kph = kilometer per hour. \n           Source: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n5. \nThe  benefits  from  the  reduced  number  of  accidents  are  an  important  part  of  economic \nbenefits. Accident reduction was estimated from the findings of a study on accidents carried out \nby the Highway Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications. Although the \neconomic cost of accidents  may be  higher on the  project ring road  than  on  the  existing  roads \ndue  to  higher  severity,  with  the  Project  the  number  of  accidents  per  vehicle-kilometer will be \nreduced  substantially,  resulting  in  net  cost  savings  derived  from avoided accident costs. The \nreduction in lives lost was not quantified in the analysis. \n \nB. \n \nThe primary objective of the project road is to provide adequate capacity in the selected \n6. \ncorridors up to the design year. The designs are consistent with a reasonable quality of service, \ngiven the forecast peak-hour traffic volumes. The corridors themselves were chosen to accord \nwith the land use plan of the Xi\u2019an municipality. The planners considered directly serving areas \nnorth of the orbital road by aligning the northern section of the third ring road (TRR) accordingly. \nThis option was dropped on cost grounds. Aligning the southern section of the TRR to the south \nof  the  orbital  road  was  not  considered  necessary  for  land  use  planning.  The  northern  and \nsouthern sections along the orbital road are least-cost solutions to provide the required increase \nin corridor capacity. \n \n7. \nBoth  the  eastern  and  western  sections  of  the  TRR  are  on  new  alignments.  These \nalignments were selected primarily to promote new development corridors for the city, to ease \nthe development pressure on the increasingly congested central areas. The alternative options \nto  provide  additional  capacity  in  the  eastern  and  western  corridors\u2014widening the eastern  and \nwestern sections of the orbital road or constructing an elevated road on top of the second ring \nroad\u2014would  both  forgo  the  development  benefits  and  result  in  the  large  area  between  the \norbital  road  and  the  second  ring  road  not  being  adequately  served.  An  elevated  road  on  the \nsecond ring road would be very expensive because some sections are over watercourses. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  benefits  from  the  urban  transport  component  were  quantified, where appropriate, \nseparately  from  the  main  road  component.  First,  for  the  area  traffic  control  subcomponent, \nwhich  provides  equipment  for  the  control  center  and  controlled  traffic  signals  at  110 \nintersections, passenger time savings to motorized and nonmotorized transport were evaluated \nseparately.  Time  savings  would  amount  to  CNY138  million  comprising  CNY117  million  to \nmotorized  transport  and  CNY21  million  to  nonmotorized  transport.  Second,  the  pavement \n\nUrban Transport Component \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nConclusion \n\nmaintenance  equipment  will  improve  the  surface  condition  from  an  international  roughness \nindicator  of  4.0 to 3.0  on  690  km  of  urban  roads  (other than the  project  roads).  The resulting \naverage  VOC  saving  is  CNY0.074  per  vehicle  km  for  about  4,000  vehicles  in  2008.  The  total \nVOC  savings  will  be  about  CNY82  million  in  2010.  Third,  the road safety  strategy  and  audit \nprogram will enable the government to implement programs to enhance road safety, reduce the \nnumber  and  severity  of  accidents,  and  improve  public  awareness  of  ownership  of  and \nparticipation  in  road  safety.  This  would  reduce  travel  delays  caused  by  conflicts  between \nvehicles  and  bicycles or  pedestrians.  With  an  effective  road  safety  program  in  place,  road \naccidents could be reduced by 2\u20134% a year. \n \nD. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 15.4% (Table A12.3). Time \n9. \nsavings  are the major economic benefit (57%), followed by  VOC  savings (41%),  and  accident \ncost savings (2%). Sensitivity analysis tested seven scenarios to assess the robustness of the \nresults  of  the  economic  analysis  (Table  A12.4).  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than \n44%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \npast  experience  of  ADB\u2013financed  projects  in  the  PRC  road  sector,  this  switching  value  is \nunlikely  to  occur.  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  the  PRC  have  not  encountered  major  cost \noverruns,  and  the  contract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. The benefits level would have to decrease more \nthan 30% to make the Project economically nonviable.  A reduction in the value of time by 30% \nand  a  1-year  delay  in  completion  do  not  affect  economic  viability.  Combinations  of  adverse \neffects  of  costs  and  benefits  were  also  tested.  The  result  showed  that  the  Project  would \nmaintain its economic viability under those scenarios.  \n\n\fTable A12.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2003 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n\nCosts\n\nBenefits\n\nYear\n\nCapital\n\nO&M\n\nTotal\n\nVOC \nSavings\n\nTime \nSavings\n\nAccident \nSavings\n\nNet                \n\nTotal\n\nBenefit\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49\n\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n\n       \n    \n    \n    \n\n554\n1,108\n2,217\n1,663\n\n         \n\n95\n\n-2,771 \n\n           \n9\n         \n10\n         \n11\n         \n12\n         \n13\n         \n14\n         \n15\n         \n16\n         \n17\n         \n18\n         \n19\n         \n20\n         \n21\n         \n22\n         \n23\n         \n24\n         \n25\n         \n26\n         \n27\n         \n28\n\n554\n           \n1,108\n        \n2,217\n        \n        \n1,663\n               \n9\n             \n10\n             \n11\n             \n12\n             \n13\n             \n14\n             \n15\n             \n16\n             \n17\n             \n18\n             \n19\n             \n20\n             \n21\n             \n22\n             \n23\n           \n119\n             \n25\n             \n26\n27\n             \n-2,743 \n\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n243\n269\n298\n330\n366\n406\n449\n498\n552\n611\n677\n750\n832\n921\n1,021\n1,131\n1,253\n1,389\n1,539\n1,705\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n221\n248\n277\n311\n348\n389\n436\n488\n546\n611\n684\n816\n974\n1,162\n1,386\n1,654\n1,973\n2,354\n2,808\n3,350\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n20\n22\n25\n28\n31\n32\n34\n36\n38\n39\n40\n42\n43\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n52\n\n-554 \n-1,108 \n-2,217 \n-1,663 \n475\n529\n590\n657\n732\n813\n904\n1,006\n1,119\n1,244\n1,383\n1,589\n1,828\n2,107\n2,430\n2,713\n3,249\n3,766\n4,370\n7,850\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n484\n539\n600\n669\n744\n827\n919\n1,022\n1,136\n1,262\n1,402\n1,609\n1,849\n2,128\n2,453\n2,832\n3,274\n3,791\n4,397\n5,107\n\nEconomic Net Present Value at 12%  =\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return =\n\n     \n\n1,679\n15.4%\n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n\nSource: Technical Assistance Consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\nScenario\n\n    Base Case\n1.

The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy,  which \nhighlights the rationale  for  investing  in  the  urban  sector  on  the  basis  of  the  central  role  played  by \nurban centers in economic growth. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n                               Classification: Other \n\n \nTransportation  and  road  projects  can  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  a  number  of  direct  and \nindirect  ways.    Improvements  in  access  and  mobility  are  a  key  step  in  poverty  reduction.  Poverty \nanalysis  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  and  to  determine \nwhether the Project could be enhanced to increase its impact on poverty reduction.  \n  \nThere are 3 million people in the project area: 1.9 million in the urban area and 1.1 million in the rural \narea. Of the urban residents 4.2% earn less than CNY3,000 per capita per annum, while 8.0% of the \nrural  residents  earn  less  than  CNY1,000  per  capita  per  annum.  Consequently  the  recommended \npoverty classification of the Project is \u2018Other\u2019 as it is not a poverty intervention project; nonetheless, \nthe economic benefits of the project will have indirect benefits for the poor. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \n \nStakeholder  participation  and  consultation  have  been  going  on  since  the  start  of  the  Project. \nIntroductory  meetings  with  key  agencies  and  the  districts  in  the  project  area  during  the  feasibility \nstudy  have  continued  throughout  the  technical  assistance  (TA).  The  executing  agency  (EA) \nconsulted  the  affected  people  directly  during  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and \nresettlement plan preparation. The TA developed a consultation plan, which provides the basic steps \nof a process that can be continued by the EA to ensure that affected people and key agencies are \nkept informed and that a mechanism for feedback and grievance redress is in place before project \nimplementation.  The  resettlement  planning  process  was  particularly  concerned  with  ensuring  that \npeople are aware of their entitlements and identifying the needs of those who will require relocation \nas a result of the Project.   \n \nParticipation strategy required: Implementation of the resettlement plan will include participation from \nthe  affected  people  in  terms  of  developing  village  rehabilitation  strategies,  deciding  on  collective \ninvestment  of  land  compensation  funds,  reestablishing  commercial  shops  and  project-related \nemployment opportunities. \n \n\n \n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 14 \n\nD.

Based  on  the  findings,  a  poverty \nand  social  analysis  was  carried  out  to  ensure  that  the  Project  meets  safeguard  policy \nrequirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. \n \n2. \nBy current government standards of poverty, the project area has a relatively low poverty \nincidence  (Table  A14.1)  because  Xi\u2019an  is  the  capital  and  economic  hub  of  Shaanxi  province. \nAbout 3 million people live in the project area: 1.9 million in the urban area and 1.1 million in the \nrural  area.  The  low  income  population  includes  4.2%  of  urban  residents  earning  less  than \nCNY3,000 per capita per annum and 8.0% of rural residents earning CNY1,000 per capita per \nannum. \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fTable A14.1:  Poverty Data of Xi\u2019an and the Project Area, 2001 \n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n53\n\nParameter \n\nPopulation \n\n- Rural  \n\n- Urban  \n\nNational Key Working County for Poverty Reduction  \n\nDistricts/Counties Having Poverty Reduction Program  \n\nTownship/Subdistrict with Concentration of Poor \n\nVillages with Poor and Low Income Population \nKey Working Villages Under 2001\u20132010 Poverty Reduction \nProgram  \nRegistered Poor (<CNY625/capita/year) \n\nProject Area \n\n3,013,066 \n\n1,122,769 \n\n1,890,297 \n\nXi\u2019an \nMunicipality \n6,948,369 \n\n4,022,129 \n\n2,926,240 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n9 \n\n \n\n56 \n\n1 \n\n6 \n\n49 \n\n1,042 \n\n390 \n\n13,195 \n\n358,450 \n\nRural Poverty Incidence (below CNY625)\u2014Official \n\n                    1.2% \n\n                     8.9% \n\nRural Poverty Incidence (below CNY1,000)\u2014Survey \n\n                    8.0% \n\nUrban Poverty Incidence (below CNY2,160)\u2014Official \n\n \n\nUrban Poverty Incidence (below CNY3,000)\u2014Survey and Estimate \n\n                    4.2% \n\n \n\n6.0% \n\n18.0% \n\n Source: Xi\u2019an Municipal Poverty Alleviation and Development Office and technical assistance consultants. \n \n\nThe community surveys provided some insight into the reasons for poverty in the project \n3. \narea.  For the rural poor, dependence on agriculture, and often cropping, as the sole activity was \ncited as the main reason.  Difficult access was also cited by rural focus groups. Some 11 of the \n40  villages  participating  in  the  community  survey  had  access  only  via  gravel  and  earth  roads, \nand this situation constrains economic activities. For the urban poor, unemployment of the sole \nor  main  income  earner  and  lack  of  skills  were  the  most  common  reasons.    Large  households \nand  households  with  sick  or  disabled  members,  as  well  as  unregistered  people  looking  for \ncasual work, were cited as contributing to poverty in rural and urban households alike. \n \n4. \nPoverty  Impacts.  The  Project  will  have  both  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  poverty.   \nDirect  impacts  will  be  derived  from  construction  employment  opportunities,  savings  in  travel \ntime, and the potential for vehicle cost savings in passenger transport (buses) to be passed on \nto  passengers.  The  Project  will  benefit  the  local  poor  and  migrant  workers  by  hiring  unskilled \nand  semiskilled  labor  for  construction  activities.  It  has  been  observed  that  most  of  the  job \nopportunities  in  other  road  construction  projects  in  and  around  Xi\u2019an  go  to  the  poor  since  the \nwork is arduous and relatively low paying compared with other opportunities in the city. On-the-\njob training to be provided will improve the chances for reemployment once road construction is \ncomplete.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities  that \nresult  from  the  third  ring  road  (TRR)  and  induced  urbanization.  Congestion  on  the  first  and \nsecond ring roads will be reduced, and travel times will improve by 1\u20132 km/hour over the entire \nnetwork, generating substantial economic benefit for all users. \n \n5. \nMajor  long-term  indirect  benefits  will  be  derived  from  the  extension  of  the  radial  roads \nbeyond  the  TRR  and  orbital  road,  which  will  improve  access  to  the  satellite  towns  and  rural \nareas. The poor will benefit from trickle down effects from improvements in the  local economy. \nAccelerated  urbanization  related  to  the  construction  of  the  TRR  will  give  households  more \nopportunities  to  diversify  income.  Household  poverty  and  vulnerability  will  be  reduced  with \nmultiple  income  earners  and  more  than  one  source  of  income.  Survey data shows that rural \nhouseholds  with  incomes  over  and  above  that  derived  solely  from  agricultural  production  are \nbetter off than households that rely solely on farming (cropping or livestock). \n \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 14 \n\n6. \nSocial  Impacts. The alignment of the TRR was selected to minimize potential adverse \nsocial  impacts.  The  northern  and  southern  sections  of  the  alignment  will  be  common  with  the \norbital road. The affected people and enterprises are aware of the Project and the construction \nimpacts.  \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  adverse  or  significant  social  effect  on  minority  groups.   \n7. \nThere  is  only  one  ethnic  minority  group  in  the  project  area\u2014the  Hui  (Muslim)  who  are \nconcentrated in the inner city districts.     \n \nWomen will not be adversely affected by the Project by virtue of their gender. They will \n8. \nequally  share  the  project  benefits.  Nonetheless,  some  measures  have  been  included  to \nenhance the benefits to women. They include income restoration through microcredit, capacity \nbuilding, preferential hiring policy for project construction, and training programs.  \n \n9. \nSocial Development Action Plan. A social development action plan (Table A14.2) was \nformulated  and  endorsed  by  the  Project  Company  to  ensure  that  potential  social  impacts  are \nmitigated.  The  plan  includes  expanded  public  bus  services,  protection  of  communities  from \nconstruction  disturbances,  control  of  transmissible  diseases,  cultural  relics  and  ecotourism \nresource protection, and priority to local poor and women for construction works. The required \nactions, responsible agencies, and funding sources for these measures are set out in the social \ndevelopment action plan. \n \n10. \nThe following measures are planned: (i) provide pedestrian walkways/bridges to restore \naccess  and  provide  safety;  (ii)  provide  bus  lanes,  stops,  and  transfer  stations;  (iii)  develop \nfarmers  markets  and  commercial  strip  malls  for  villagers  to  sell  their  produce  in  an  enhanced \nenvironment;  (iv)  formulate  microcredit  schemes  for  villages  to  establish  businesses in these \nnew malls; and (v) arrange local surplus labor in new enterprises that move near the TRR. \n \n\n\f \nTable A14.2:  Social Development Action Plan \n\nAgencies \nInvolved \n \nXi\u2019an Public Bus \nCompany \n\nTiming \n\n \n2005 onward \n\n \nOver 5 million people \n(both urban and rural \ncitizens of Xi\u2019an and its \nneighboring areas) \n\n \n \nOver 45,000 population \n \n+100 villages   \n\n \n \nIA and \ncontractors  \n\n \n \n2003\u20132007 \n\n \nOver 20,000 workers, \nmostly rural poor \n\n \nIA  \nContractors  \n\n \n2003\u20132006 \n\nProposed Actions  \n\nTargets \n\nNew public bus service \nAbout 10 interchange stations along 3rd \nring road \nCircuit bus routes on the 3rd ring road \nBus routes to 13 satellite towns from \ninterchange stations  \nBus routes to inner districts from \ninterchange stations  \nProtection of communities from \nconstruction disturbances \nProhibit nighttime construction (22:00-6:00 \nhours) \nBuild 155 pedestrian crossings  \nReconstruct damaged irrigation and \ndrainage systems  \nControl of transmissible diseases \nHealth clinics in construction camps  \nInformation on HIV and STD prevention  \n\nAwareness on cultural relics protection \nInformation/posters on protection of cultural \nrelics  \nProtection and development of eco-tourism \nresources  \n\n \n\nSpecial income recovery for \nresettlement-affected people \nTraining on urban employment skills  \nTraining of women on employment skills  \nEmployment information flow to affected \npopulation \nPriority  to  local  vulnerable   people  for \nconstruction work \nAfforestation contracted to local firms \nContractors encouraged to employ 50% or \nmore local women for afforestation work  \nSeedlings exclusively from local nurseries  \nContractors encouraged to maximize \nemployment of poor local laborers \n\n \n \n \nOver 3,000 laborers, \nincluding 1,500 women \n\n \n \n \n+1,000 locals  \n \n+500 women \n\n \nIA \nContractors  \nCultural Relics \nBureau \n \n \n \n \nIA \nLabor and social \nsecurity bureaus \n \n \n \nIA \nContractors  \n \n\n2003\u20132006 \n\n \n \n \n2003\u20132006 \n\n \n \n \n2003\u20132007 \n\nFunding  \nSources \n \nTo be planned \n \nPublic bus company \n \nMunicipal \ngovernment \n\n \n \nIncluded in project \ncosts , as specified in \nthe EIA \n\n \nIncluded in project \ncosts , as specified in \nthe EIA \n\n \nIncluded in project \ncosts , as specified \nin the EIA \nCultural relics and \ntourism bureaus  \n \n \n \nProject and \ngovernment \nCovered by RP \n \n \n \nIndirect project cost \n\nMonitoring Indicators \n\n \n\n \nNumber of interchange \nstations  \nNumber of new bus routes \nusing and passing the 3rd ring \nroad  \n\n \n\n \n \nWorking hours  \nNumber of pedestrian \ncrossings  \nDamage and repairs to \nirrigation and drainage canals  \n \nNumber of clinics  \nNumber of patients  \nInformation dissemination and \neffectiveness \n \nInformation dissemination and \neffectiveness \n \nInvestments in eco-tourism \n\n \n \n \nNumber of trainees  by gender \nNumber of courses  \nNumber of employed  \n \n \n \nNumber of vulnerable \nemployed \nNumber of local women \nemployed \nNumber of seedlings procured \nlocally  \nNumber of poor local laborers \nemployed \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5\n5\n \n\nEIA = environmental impact assessment, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus, IA = implementing agency, RP = resettlement plan, STD = sexually transmitted disease. \nSources: Xi\u2019an Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Commission and Project Company.  \n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nThe third ring road (TRR) and upgraded connector roads will pass through 3 districts, 17 \n1. \nwards, and 105 villages. The project components will permanently occupy 1,000 hectares (ha), \nof which 839 ha is owned by village collectives and requires compensation. Efforts were made \nto  reduce  resettlement  impacts  by  selecting  a  route  that  would  occupy  as  little  farmland  as \npossible  and  require  demolition  of  as  few  houses  as  possible.  The  alignment  was  close to \nvillages without going through built-up areas. The general alignment of the ring road has been in \nthe Xi\u2019an master plan for many years. In many places the local government had restricted new \nconstruction along the proposed alignment. The decision to combine the northern and southern \nsections  with  the  orbital  road  reduced  the  amount  of  land  acquisition  by  170  ha  and  avoided \n475,059  square  meters  (m2)  of  buildings/houses,  thereby  reducing  the  number  of  people \naffected. During construction, an additional 330 ha will be used temporarily for 1\u20133 years. The \nfloor  space  of  total  buildings/houses  lost  is  1.3  million  m2,  of  which  73%  is  village \nresidential/commercial area and 27% institutional/enterprise premises.  \n \n2. \nIt is estimated that (i) 3,394 rural households will be affected only by land acquisition, (ii) \n540 rural households will be affected by both land acquisition and building/house relocation, (iii) \n2,736  rural  and  urban  households  will  be  affected  only  by  residential/commercial  area \nrelocation, and  (iv)  151 enterprises with  a total staff of  5,087  will  be affected either directly or \nindirectly. A total of 29,044 persons will be affected, making up 2% of the total population in the \nthree districts immediately affected by the Project (Table A15.1).   \n \n\nTable A15.1: Population Affected by the Project \n\n \n\nDistrict  \n\nYanta \nWeiyang \nBaqiao \nTotal  \n\nWard/Township \n\nVillage \n\nHousehold \n\nPopulation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal  Affected \n       5 \n    8 \n       9 \n  12 \n       3 \n  11 \n     17 \n  31 \n\n  Total  Affected \n \n \n \n \n\n28 \n201 \n60 \n252 \n259 \n17 \n712      105 \n\n \n  147,275 \n  116,614 \n  121,944 \n  385,833 \n\n1,394 \n2,982 \n1,754 \n6,130 \n\nTotal  Affected \n\nTotal \n \n588,102 \n \n385,731 \n \n \n433,623 \n  1,407,456 \n\nAffected \n    6,004 \n12,154 \n10,866 \n29,044 \n\n \n\nAffected \nEnterprises  \n\n  Units  Persons  \n\n   23 \n  112 \n    16 \n  151 \n\n442 \n4,071 \n574 \n5,087 \n\nResettlement Principles and Compensation \n\n \nB. \n \n3. \nLand  acquisition  is  governed  by  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the 1999  Methods of Execution of the Land Administration Law in Shaanxi, \nand  the  2003  Management  Regulations  of  Xi \u2019an  Urban  Building  Removal.  Resettlement  will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Social Protection Strategy, as well as the \nlocal resettlement practices for similar projects in Xi\u2019an. The resettlement plan (RP) addresses \nlosses and impacts on different groups, businesses, and structures. Based on the inventory of \nlosses,  an  entitlement  matrix  was  developed,  which  recognizes  all  types  of  affected  persons \n(AP)  and  their  losses,  irrespective  of  ownership  or  registration  (Table  A15.2). Losses suffered \nby AP have been categorized as land loss, structure loss, land attachment loss, business/salary \nloss, and crop loss. \n \nThe  main  objective of  the  RP  is  to  restore  and  improve  the  economic  condition of the \n4. \nAPs,  particularly  vulnerable  groups.  Measures  such  as  a  transitional  allowance  for  lost \nlivelihood,  business/economic  rehabilitation  support,  and  training  for  livelihoods  were  adopted. \nEconomic  rehabilitation  will  be  partly  supported  by  employment  and  income  generation \nopportunities related to project construction works.  \n \n\n        Source: Resettlement Plan. \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n57\n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of RP, and Grievances \n\nC. \n \n5. \nSince  the  Project  will  have  significant  impacts,  community  views  were  sought  through \nconsultation meetings. Between July 2002 and February 2003, 33 focus group discussions were \nconducted, 1,550 households in 22 affected villages were surveyed, and owners of 20 affected \nenterprises  were  interviewed.  From  April  to  June  2003,  all  affected  villages  and  enterprises \nwere investigated and consulted, and seriously affected villages formulated initial rehabilitation \nplans.  In  July  2003,  5,000  copies  of  a  resettlement  information booklet  were  distributed  to  all \naffected  villages,  households,  and  enterprises.  In  August,  the  approved  compensation \nstandards and road alignment were announced to the local people.  At various stages of project \nplanning,  APs  were  informed  of,  and  consulted  about,  the  likely  impacts  of  the  Project. \nStakeholders  consulted  included  (i)  heads  of  households/business  units  to  be  affected;  (ii) \nvillage  heads  and  villagers\u2019  representatives;  (iii)  local  government  agencies  and  departments; \nand  (iv)  women,  the  poor,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  More  intensive  consultations  were \nundertaken to formulate village rehabilitation plans for the most seriously affected villages.  The \nconsultations will continue throughout project implementation.  \n \n6. \nThe RP prepared by the Xi\u2019an Municipal Third Ring Road Construction and Development \nCompany  (Project  Company)  was  discus sed with  local  government  agencies  to  understand \nlocal and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies, compensation standards, and resettlement \nstrategy. Public consultation meetings held in each affected district verified local support for the \nProject. Regarding land acquisition and resettlement, there were concerns about adjusting the \nroad  alignment,  improved  compensation  standards,  resettlement  options,  and  entitlements. \nOnce the final design is approved, there will be a detailed measurement survey of the alignment \nand  compensation  agreements  will  be  signed  with  all  affected  villages,  households,  and \nenterprises.  \n \nD.  \n \n7. \nResettlement  site  selection  was  considered  with  the  income  restoration  plans.  There \nwere three options  in  selecting  residential  resettlement  sites:  (i)  for  areas  where  only several \nhouseholds  are  involved  in  house  relocation  (light  impact),  the  new  housing  sites  can  be \nselected  in  the  same  village/community;  (ii)  for  a  village  with  more  households  involved  in \nrelocation, but with enough land for their livelihoods (intermediate impact), a site with existing or \nnew  apartment  buildings  can  be  selected,  considering  farmers\u2019  production  and  operational \nconvenience;  or  (iii)  for  a  village  with  a  serious  relocation  impact,  a  separate  village \nrehabilitation  plan  was  formulated,  for  which  final  site  selection  will  be  determined  once  the \nproject feasibility study is approved. For the relocated enterprises, new sites will be planned by \nthe  Xi\u2019an  Municipal Planning Commission. Each enterprise will be responsible for reemploying \nstaff and contract workers, and will be assisted with subsidies where necessary. \n \n8. \nThere  will  be  few  opportunities  for  agricultural  development  because  urbanization \npressure  in  the  project  area  is  already  strong,  except  in  places  such  a  Chang\u2019An  ancient  city \nwhere  investment  will  be  made  for  vegetable  gardening  and  animal  husbandry.  Fortunately, \ncommercial  and  industrial  opportunities  near  the  new  ring  road  will  improve  significantly. \nProposed  income  rehabilitation  measures  are  as  follows: (i)  provide employment opportunities \nin  new  commercial  and  industrial  enterprises,  (ii)  establish  collective  enterprises,  (iii)  open \nprivate shops and businesses, (iv) rent land and housing, and (v) provide subsidies and  social \nsecurity  system   for  vulnerable  groups  and  poor  households.  Within  each  category,  detailed \nneeds for farmers to  expand their working skills will be  identified,  and  relevant  training  will  be \nplanned. For vulnerable groups, the Project will provide a special social assistance fund to  help \neach household restore its livelihood. \n \n \n\nResettlement Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 15 \n\nImplementation Framework and Budget \n\nE. \n \n9. \nOn  behalf  of  the  Xi\u2019an  municipal  government,  the  Xi\u2019an  Municipal  Urban  and  Rural \nConstruction  Commission  (XMURCC)  will  be  responsible  for  general  administration  and \ncoordination  of  the  Project.  The  leading  group  and  a  permanent  office  were  established  to \ncoordinate  interagency  responsibilities.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  department  within \nthe  Project  Company  was  established,  and  experienced  staff  were  recruited.  This  department \nwill  supervise  and  assist  the  local  government  offices  that  will  implement  land  acquisition, \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  and  resolving  grievances.  Resettlement \ncoordination offices were established in each affected district and several wards. Each affected \nvillage will appoint at least one person as a member of the ward office to assist with preparing \nand  implementing  relocation  and  economic  rehabilitation  plans.  Each  village  or  neighborhood \ncommittee will be actively involved with implementing resettlement. \n \n10. \nIn July 2003, the Xi\u2019an municipal government approved the compensation standards for \nthe  Project.  Detailed  impact  investigations  have  been  completed  and  provide  accurate \nquantities for the cost estimate. Based on the compensation rates, and the estimated impacts \nbased on preliminary design data, the budget for land  acquisition and resettlement is estimated \nat  $180.5  million  equivalent,  excluding  contingencies.  This  is  relatively  high  because  of  the \nlocation of the ring road in the relatively densely populated suburban area. Most of the land is \nowned  by  rural  collectives,  and  hence  the  land  compensation  needs  to  be  paid  at  a  high \naverage rate of CNY25,000 per 0.067 hectare in addition to relocation costs for residences and \nenterprises.  \n \nThe Project Company will establish a system for internal monitoring of land acquisition \n11. \nand resettlement to guarantee timely and adequate land acquisition and resettlement works in \naccordance with the  RP  and  to  ensure  the  entitlements  of  the  AP  are  fully  met.  The  Project \nCompany  will  summarize  resettlement  progress  in  the  quarterly  reports  it  submits  to  ADB.  At \nmidterm  and  at  project  completion,  the  Project  Company  will  submit  resettlement  evaluation \nreports  to  ADB  that  summarize  achievements,  outstanding  issues,  and  remedial  measures. \nEach  year,  the  XMURCC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  summary  of  the  annual  resettlement  audit  of \ndisbursements and expenditures, prepared by the Xi\u2019an Municipal Audit Bureau. Resettlement \nsupervision milestones have been agreed upon (Table A15.3). \n \n12. \nThe  Project  Company  will  hire  an  independent  institute  for  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation  of  resettlement.  The  tasks  follow:  (i)  prepare  the  baseline  data,  (ii)  verify  the \nadequacy  and  timeliness  of  compensation  payments,  (iii)  assess  economic  rehabilitation \nmeasures  and  adequacy  of  the  budget,  (iv)  assess  the  quality  of  new  house  construction  and \ntimely  transfer,  (v)  appraise  the  effectiveness  of  the  grievance  procedure,  (vi)  collect opinions \nand  level  of  satisfaction  of  APs,  (vii)  assess  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  agencies \nresponsible for resettlement, (viii) survey households to assess whether they have restored or \nimproved  their  living  conditions  and  income  levels,  and  (ix)  assess  the  rehabilitation  of \nenterprises and redeployment of staff and contract workers. External monitoring will be carried \nout  every  6  months  in  the  first  2  years,  and  then  annually  for  2\u20133  years.  Monitoring  and \nevaluation reports will be submitted to the Project Company and ADB. \n \n\n\fType of Loss \n\nApplication  \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nTable A15.2: Entitlement Matrix \n\nEntitled Person/ \nGroup \nLand-owning groups  \n \nFarmers who use \nthe land \n \n \n\nLand compensation and \nresettlement subsidies, \nrespectively \n\nReplacement land and/or \ncash payments and/or \nincome restoration measures  \n\nCash compensation for trees \n(based on type, age, and \ndiameter) and standing crops  \n\n \n\nPermanent loss of \narable land \n\nArable land located \nin the ROW of the \n3rd ring road and \ninterconnector \nroads  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLand adjacent to \nROW for \nconstruction \npurposes  \nForestland within \nROW \n\nTemporary loss of \narable land \n\nForestland \n\nFarmers who use \nthe land \n\nCash compensation based on \nAAOV for each year land is \nnot available + reinstatement \nto preconstruction condition \nLocal forest bureau   Cash compensation to forest \n\nLoss of residential \nland \n\nResidential land \nlocated in or \naffected by ROW \n\nRural land-owning \ncollectives  \n \n \n\nbureau according to \nstandards and regulation of \nShaanxi provincial laws \nNew plot provided by the \nvillage committee, which \nreceives compensation from \nthe Project \n \n\nLoss of residential \nhouse and assets  \n\nHousing located in \nor affected by ROW \n\nOwner of rural \nhouses  \n \nOwner of urban units \nor houses  \n\nCash compensation at \nreplacement rates for all \nbuildings.
