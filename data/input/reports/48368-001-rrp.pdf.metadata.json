In March 2015, Myanmar had 4,655 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity, of which \nhydroelectric  power  plants  accounted  for  3,151  MW  (67.7%).  The  available  capacity  is  only \nabout  50%  of  the  total. 3  Gas  and  coal  power  plants  are  not  fully  operated  due  to  poor \nmaintenance,  while  hydropower  lacks  water  during  the  dry  season.  Hence,  Myanmar\u2019s  power \ngrid experiences significant load shedding during the dry season of up to 500 MW. Annual per \ncapita  electricity  consumption  in  2013  was  165  kilowatt-hours  (kWh),  among  the  lowest  in  the \nworld.  4  The  world  average  consumption  is  3,000  kWh/capita;  the  least-developed  country \naverage is 174 kWh/capita. The inadequate and unreliable supply of electricity and the high cost \nof  backup  generators  are  major  obstacles  for  industries  and  major  hindrances  to  economic \ngrowth.  The  lack  of  electricity  also  hampers  social  progress;  health,  education,  and  other \nessential services were negatively impacted by the low electrification rate of 33% in 2014.5 \n \nSince 2011, the Myanmar government has introduced important economic and political \n3. \nreforms,  and  significantly  improved  the  regulatory  framework  for  foreign  direct  investment.  In \nparticular, it has pursued a policy of liberalizing the  energy sector and opening it up to foreign \ninvestment.  In  2013,  Myanmar  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  for  the \ndevelopment  of  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  framework  and  tools  to  better  direct  and \nbalance PPP project outcomes. ADB Southeast Asia Department provided technical assistance \n(TA) to help the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) develop fair and balanced terms for private \nsector  investment  in  power  generation. 6  The  TA  established  international  standard  criteria, \nprocesses,  analytic  methods,  and  documentation  to  provide  a  sound  basis  for  government \ntendering  of  projects  with  private  sector  participation,  by  taking  advantage  of  established \nprinciples  of  competitive  bidding  and  procurement  criteria  in  other  countries  with  a  sound \nregulatory framework. ADB provided MOEP with a draft framework power purchase agreement \n(PPA) and tendering documents, such as a request for proposal template for a variety of power \ngeneration technologies. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) maximum aggregate liability under the PRG will be $240 million.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Electric Power. 2015.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAn  International  Finance  Corporation  advisory  team  was  subsequently  appointed  to \n4. \nassist MOEP in preparing the bidding process for the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project. The \nproject  will  design,  supply,  construct,  commission,  operate,  and  maintain  a  combined-cycle, \ngas-fired power generation plant with a net capacity of 225 MW. The draft PPA and other tender \ntemplate documents developed by ADB form the basis of the Myingyan bidding process, which \nis the first competitive and transparent tender for a power plant in Myanmar. The new gas-fired \nplant  will  ensure  system  stability  and  reliability,  and  help  to  avoid  future  shortages  in  power \ngeneration  capacity.  The  plant  will  not  be  affected  by  seasonal  weather  patterns,  and  will  be \nlocated closer to Myanmar\u2019s main load center than the hydroelectric power plants. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department was engaged early in the bidding process \nto  ensure  that  bidders  had  the  opportunity  to  optimize  their  proposals  by  leveraging  the \ninvolvement of international financial institutions, like ADB, in the nascent financial environment \nof  Myanmar,  where  commercial  long-term  funding  is  still  extremely  scarce  and  perceived \npolitical risk is high. ADB reached out to the short-listed bidders after the first round to explore \npotential  assistance  with  them.  The  transparent  bidding  process  resulted  in  a  competitive  and \nsustainable tariff for  the government  in  the final  round.  Sembcorp  Utilities  Pte.  Ltd.  (SCU),  the \nwinning bidder, was among those that expressed a strong interest in ADB financial assistance, \nincluding an A loan, a B loan, and a PRG, to support their bid. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe  project  is  a  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT),  PPP  transaction  for  a  combined-cycle, \nnatural gas power plant with a net capacity of 225 MW to be located in Myingyan, approximately \n500 kilometers (km) north of Yangon and 90 km west of Mandalay. The project has two phases: \n(i) constructing a 143 MW single-cycle gas turbine; and (ii) upgrading the turbine to a 225 MW \ncombined-cycle  plant,  following  the  completion  of  a  steam  turbine.  The  project  company  will \nenter  into  a  PPA  with  Myanma Electric  Power  Enterprise  (MEPE),  a  state-owned utility,  and a \nBOT  agreement  with  MOEP.  Myanma  Oil  and  Gas  Enterprise  (MOGE)  will  enter  into  a  gas \nsupply agreement (GSA) with MEPE to supply natural gas for use at the Myingyan power plant. \nMEPE  will  pay  the  value  of  the  gas  delivered  directly  to  MOGE.  The  project  will  construct \nassociated  facilities,  such  as  (i)  transmission  facilities,  including  a  3  km  transmission  line  to \nconnect the power plant to the nearby Myingyan 230 kV substation, which dispatches power to \nthe grid; and (ii) a 14 km water supply line from the river intake to the power plant. MEPE will \nbuild a 1 km gas pipeline to the existing pipeline.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower \n\nThe borrower of the project will be a newly created, special-purpose project company in \n7. \nMyanmar.  It  will  be  80%  owned  by  SCU,  a  leading  developer,  owner,  and  operator  of  energy \nand  water  assets  globally,  and  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Sembcorp  Industries  Pte.  Ltd. \n(SCI);  and  20%  by  MMID  Utilities  Pte.  Ltd.  (MMID),  a  Singaporean  company  established  to \npartner with SCU in this project (together with SCU, the sponsors).  \n \n8. \nHeadquartered  in  Singapore,  SCU  has  a  successful  track  record  of  operating \nindependent  power  producers  globally,  and  has  strong  operating  and  technical  capabilities.  It \nhas over 7,800 MW of power capacity installed or under development, and manages more than \n9  million  m3/day  of  bulk  water  supply  capacity  in  operation  or  under  development  worldwide. \nSCU accounted for approximately half of SCI\u2019s profits in financial year 2014. SCI is listed on the \n\n\f3 \n3 \n\n \n\nSingapore  Exchange  and  had  a  market  capital  of  S$6.5  billion  ($4.6  billion)  as  of  29  October \n2015.  SCI\u2019s  largest  shareholder  is  Temasek  Holdings  (49.5%),  Singapore\u2019s  sovereign  wealth \nfund. No other shareholder owns 5% or more shares in SCI. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n  \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n9. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  reliability  and  stability  of  Myanmar\u2019s  power  supply,  while \naddressing power shortages and helping avoid future brownouts. As the first competitive tender \nfor a power plant in Myanmar that adheres to international best practices and uses a model PPA \nprepared  by  an  ADB  TA,  the  successful  financial  close  and  operation of  this  project  will  set  a \nprecedent  for  future  tenders.  Successful  tenders  and  completion  of  more  independent  power \nproducer  projects  will  help  strengthen  the  regulatory  and  legal  framework  in  the  sector,  and \nsignal growing stability to the market. The project will increase private sector financing for power \nthrough a PPP model. ADB\u2019s proposed B loan and PRG will generate long-term financing from \ninternational  banks  for  the  project,  which  will  set  an  important  market-based  benchmark  for \nlimited  recourse  financing  in  Myanmar.  These  are  aligned  with  the  government  target  of \nenhancing energy efficiency and conservation, and ensuring access to affordable energy. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  the  increased  provision  of  competitively  priced,  reliable \n10. \nbaseload electricity to address chronic power cuts and to  allow for expansion of the grid. ADB \nwill  play  an  important  role  in  helping  Myanmar  expand  its  nascent  power  sector;  the  much-\nneeded  additional  capacity  will  come  from  modern  gas-fired  technology,  which  emits \nsubstantially less carbon dioxide than coal-fired generation. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project\u2019s outputs will comprise (i) the successful completion and commissioning of a \n11. \n143 MW single-cycle power plant (phase 1), (ii) the successful completion and commissioning of \na 225 MW efficient combined-cycle natural gas power plant (phase 2), and (iii) the completion of \nassociated  facilities,  including  a  3  km  transmission  line.  Myingyan  is  the  first  competitively \ntendered  power  plant  in Myanmar  according to  international  standards, and will  be  ADB\u2019s  first \npower generation project in Myanmar since its re-engagement in the country in 2012.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n12. \nConsistency  with  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.  The  project  is  consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,  which  identifies  inclusive  growth  and \ninfrastructure  development  as  two  of  the  four  strategic  priorities  to  sharpen  the  focus  of  ADB \noperations.7 Capitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  core  strength  of  financing  infrastructure  development,  the \nreview  sets  forth  that  ADB  will  continue to  help  expand the  supply  of  energy,  promote  energy \nefficiency,  and  support  clean  energy.  It  aims  to  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in \nfinancing infrastructure development by supporting PPPs. The project is also fully in line with the \nreview\u2019s  emphasis  on  strengthening  private  sector  operations  in  Asian  Development  Fund \nrecipient countries, and expanding connectivity.  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s \ninterim  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Myanmar.8 A  needs  assessment  identified \nthe  energy  sector  as  a  critical  development  constraint.  The  assistance  is  also  closely  aligned \nwith the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017, which extends the validity of the interim \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  and  focuses  on  infrastructure  investments  in  energy  and  PPP \nthrough ADB\u2019s private sector operations.9 \n \nConsistency  with  the  sector  strategy. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy emphasizes investments \n14. \nin  energy  efficiency,  least-cost  supply,  private  sector  participation,  and  wider  access  for  the \npoor.10 ADB supports projects that use efficient technologies, such as combined cycle. Natural \ngas is a preferred energy source over coal for providing baseload electricity. The energy policy \nalso  supports  PPP  models  that  enable  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  to  help  achieve \nefficiencies and reduce reliance on public sector funds. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\n15. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nConstruction arrangements \nType of arrangement  \n\nSince 2013, the Myanmar government has promulgated several laws, such as the \nForeign Investment Law, to support economic deregulation and market liberalization. \nThe project was developed as a public\u2013private partnership and awarded a PPA \nthrough an international, least-cost, competitive bidding process with advisory support \nfrom the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.  \nProject development, construction, and operation will be managed by the borrower, \nwhich is controlled by SCU and MMID.  \nJanuary 2016\u2013November 2017 (commercial operation of phase 1 in June 2017 and \ncommercial operation of phase 2 in November 2017) \n \nThe project will be constructed under a fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey engineering, \nprocurement, and construction arrangement covering all design, engineering, supply, \nconstruction, testing, and commissioning. Phase 1 commissioning of a 143 MW \nsingle-cycle plant is scheduled for June 2017; phase 2 commissioning of a 225 MW \ncombined-cycle plant is scheduled for November 2017.  \nJurong Engineering, a Singapore-based company and a subsidiary of IHI Corporation \nof Japan, and subsidiaries of SCI and SCU will form a consortium. Jurong, SCI, and \nSCU have experience with similar project design and construction.  \n \n\nO&M works will be supported by SCU under a technical services agreement, and by \nGeneral Electric under a long-term services agreement for the gas turbines. Both \nSCU and General Electric have a proven track record for O&M of power plants in \nseveral countries.

ADB\u2019s  substantial  participation  will  help  demonstrate  the \nbenefits  of \nlow-cost  PPP \narrangements,  and  signal  to  the  government,  multinationals,  and  international \nfinanciers  that  private  sector-led  infrastructure  investments  can  be  undertaken \nsuccessfully within sectors with sound legal and regulatory frameworks. \nDue to the inherent political risk associated with investing in Myanmar, securing \nlong-term  commercial  bank  financing  necessary  for  large-scale  infrastructure \ninvestments  remains  a  challenge.  ADB\u2019s  early  engagement  and  ability  to \ncatalyze  long-term  loans  from  international  commercial  banks  are  important \nfactors in encouraging much-needed investment. \nThe project illustrates the synergy of ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations \nto undertake a PPP project from project identification and development to project \nfinancing  seamlessly  under  a  nascent  legal  and  financial  environment.  The \nmodel PPA prepared by the ADB TA was indispensable for the bankability of the \nproject,  and  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  is  taking  a  key  catalytic  role  in \nmobilizing  commercial  financing.  It  demonstrates  ADB\u2019s  potential  for  combining \nPPP  advisory  and  project financing  to meet  increasing  infrastructure  demand in \nAsia and the Pacific.  \nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  support  an  alternative  to  coal-fired  generation  to \ngenerate significant power at competitive rates. The project will comply with ADB \nsafeguard requirements, which will ensure long-term sustainable operation of the \nproject,  and  is  expected  to  set  a  new  environmental  and  social  standard  in  the \nenergy sector in Myanmar. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRisks \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n17. \nThe project is classified category A for the environment under the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).
