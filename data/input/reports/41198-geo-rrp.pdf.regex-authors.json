Environmental concerns will be \nAssessment  addressed  through  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework agreed with the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) of \nGeorgia for selection and implementation of investment projects. \n \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  primarily  aims  at  increasing  the  effectiveness  of \nparticipating municipal governments in their identification, planning, \ndelivery, and cost recovery of municipal infrastructure and utility \nservices.  The  types  of  projects  to  be  implemented  will  include \nrehabilitation of water supply and sewerage, development of solid-\nwaste management systems, rehabilitation of municipal roads, and \nimprovement of municipal transportation. The Project will finance (i) \ncapital resources to MDF to help it develop its lending program for \nmunicipal government investments in repair and rehabilitation of \nmunicipal infrastructure and local utility services, and (ii) institutional \ndevelopment  of  participating  municipal  governments,  including \nwater supply companies, through capacity-development activities \nincluding  municipal  services  development  programs  and  training \nprograms. \n \n   \nRationale  Municipal  services\u2014including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid-\nwaste management, road repair, and urban transport\u2014in Georgia \nhave deteriorated due to economic collapse, political instability, and \na vitiated policy and institutional environment since the dissolution \nof the former Soviet Union. Capital investments in infrastructure and \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  have  been  neglected \nnationwide.  \n \nAs a result, the quality of municipal services is low. Ownership and \ndelivery  of  these  services  belongs  to  municipal  government. \nAlthough municipalities have a mandate to deliver these services, in \nmany  instances  they  do  not  have  the  financial  and  technical \nresources to do the job. Key service targets\u2014such as coverage, \nquality,  and  continuity\u2014have  been  falling  or  are  already  at \nunreasonably low levels. This situation affects the quality of life of ", "ii   \npeople but also constrains investment, business development, and \nultimately the creation of jobs. Most principal and secondary towns \nare equally affected by this problem.  \n \nThe  Government  understands  the  issue  and  has  started  to  put \ntogether a strategic framework and support actions to address it. \nThe most effective of the measures taken is the establishment of \nthe  MDF.  This  fund  provides  finance  and  technical  advice  to \nmunicipal  governments.  Its  work  so  far  has  been  effective  but \ncoverage needs to be expanded further. To date, more than 10 \nmunicipalities  have  benefited  from  MDF  operations. \nDecentralization was seen as central to achieving the objectives. \nSince  1997,  the  Government  has  carried  out  local  government \nreforms in two stages, and in that time MDF has managed to extend \nfinance to local governments while generating enough revenues to \nconvert it into effectively a revolving fund.  \n \nThe Project will focus on improving basic municipal services and \nthe  rehabilitation,  repair,  and  extension  of  dilapidated  urban \ninfrastructure. It will also provide technical assistance to assist the \nparticipating  municipalities  in  improving  local  revenues,  financial \nmanagement, and reporting systems. Moreover, an integral part of \nthe Project is to provide institutional strengthening and capacity \ndevelopment to municipalities to ensure the sustainability of project \nbenefits. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is not the only international \nfinancing institution working with the Government and MDF. The \nWorld  Bank  has  already  financed  two  municipal  development \nprojects. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nhas also participated in several large water supply projects, some of \nthem cofinanced with the Millennium Challenge Corporation on a \nparallel basis. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is the largest \nbilateral source of grant aid for Georgia, and is mainly involved in \nthe rehabilitation of water supply, sewerage, and irrigation systems. \nThe  other  bilateral  aid  agencies  are  involved  in  the  municipal \nsectors, mostly through technical cooperation by cofinancing with \nmultilateral financial agencies.  \n \nThe Project is the first ADB intervention in the country. It will build \non  the  experience  of  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  financial \ninstitutions\u2019 projects. Cooperation with other financial institutions is \ncritical and the Ministry of Finance has taken an impressive lead in \nensuring  such  cooperation.  This  is  particularly  important  for  the \ninstitutional strengthening activities under the Project, which will be \ndesigned in consultation with other international aid agencies. This \nwill maximize benefits, avoid unnecessary and costly overlap, and \nprevent confusion in policy matters. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  overall  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved \nmunicipal environment and public health in Georgia. The outcome ", "  iii\nis improved municipal infrastructure and service delivery. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  two  components:  an  investment  projects \nfinancing  facility,  and  project  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment. The output of the first component is (i) increased \nquality, coverage, and reliability of water supply, sanitation, and \nsolid-waste management; and (ii) improved roads.   \n \nThe outputs of the project management and capacity-development \ncomponent are (i) improved capacity of municipal governments to \nprepare and appraise feasibility, engineering design, environmental, \nsocial, and other related studies; (ii) improved capacity in project \nmanagement at municipal level; (iii) strengthened corporate and \nbusiness  planning  processes  within  MDF;  and  (iv)  improved \ncapacity of MDF for studies and training.    \n   \nProject Investment  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \nPlan   contingencies, is estimated at $63.25 million equivalent, including \n$9.30 million in taxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  40.00  63 \nMunicipal Development Fund  10.20  16 \nMunicipal Governments  9.80  16 \nCentral Government  3.25  5 \n  Total  63.25  100 \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  24,642,000  ($40  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.    \n \nAllocation and  The Government will make the proceeds of the ADB loan available \nRelending Terms  to MDF as a grant. Under the investment component, the proceeds \nof  the  ADB  loan  and  MDF  funds  will  be  passed  on  to  eligible \nmunicipal governments. There will be two financing windows: (i) a \ncombination of loans and grants to the financially stronger municipal \ngovernments and local utilities which have the capacity to borrow, \nand  (ii)  grants  to  the  financially  weaker  municipal  governments \nwhich have limited or zero capacity to borrow. Eligibility criteria for \nborrowing are based upon the creditworthiness of each municipal \ngovernment.  \n \nLoans from MDF to municipal governments will be in lari and will be \nrepayable in the same currency over a period of up to 10 years, \nincluding a grace period of up to 1.5 years to cover the construction \n ", "iv   \nperiod. MDF will charge interest on these loans at 12% per annum \nto  include  provisions  for  credit  defaults,  the  cost  of  MDF \nadministration and other operational expenses, and a margin of \nprofit.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nImplementation  MDF, under the overall direction and guidance of its supervisory \nArrangements  board  headed  by  the  prime  minister,  will  coordinate  project \nimplementation  work  through  consultants  and  participating \nmunicipal  governments  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nmanagement. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \n   \nProcurement  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  civil  works  that  are \nestimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent, and contracts for \ngoods that are estimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent, \nwill be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. \nCivil works contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less, \nand contracts for procurement of goods estimated to cost between \n$100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  will  be  carried  out  through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  Prior  to  commencement  of  any \nprocurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB and \nthe Government will update their review of the public procurement \nlaw  to  ensure  that  it  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines. Any necessary modifications and clarifications to the \npublic  procurement  law  will  be  agreed  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment and included in the procurement plan. Goods contracts \nestimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent will be carried out \nthrough shopping procedures. Goods valued below $10,000 and \ncivil works valued up to $10,000 may be purchased directly from the \nsupplier and contractor.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  the  procurement  plan.  The  following  methods  of \nselection will be applied: (i) quality- and cost-based selection; (ii) \nquality based selection; (iii) consultants\u2019 qualifications selection for \nsmall consultancy assignments that cost less than $200,000 per \ncontract;  (iv))  least-cost  selection  for  very  small  consultancy \nassignments  that  cost  less  than  $100,000;  (v)  fixed  budget \nselection;  and  (vi)  single  source  selection  and  ADB  individual \nconsultant  selection  procedures  for  individual  national  or \ninternational  consultants  for  the  following  types  of  assignments: ", "  v\nenvironmental, social, tariff, and O&M studies. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Due to the nature of the Project, it is not possible to determine in \nBeneficiaries  advance the municipalities that will be participating in the Project, \nnor  the  investment  projects  for  which  these  municipalities  will \nultimately request MDF financing. Therefore, a quantitative project \nbenefits analysis has not been prepared at this stage.  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit the municipal population in terms of \nhealth and living conditions resulting from (i) safer and more reliable \nwater supply, (ii) improved environmental sanitation through better \nsewerage and solid-waste management services, (iii) time savings \nassociated with collecting water, and (vi) improved road conditions. \nThe economies of these municipalities will benefit indirectly from \nenhanced  productivity  as  a  result  of  health  improvements  and \nincreased efficiency from improved roads and public transport.  \n \nThe Project will result in significant municipal infrastructure O&M \ncost savings as a result of the rehabilitated systems, and more \nefficient O&M procedures. The Project will also have a  positive \nimpact in terms of employment creation from the work involved in \nconstruction and rehabilitation, together with O&M. Training and \ntechnical assistance under the Project will enhance the productivity \nof municipal governments and MDF personnel. \n   \nRisks and  The  potential  risks  associated  with  the  Project  include  that  (i) \nAssumptions  municipal governments are unable to provide required counterpart \ncontributions for MDF investments, and (ii) arrangements for the \nO&M of subproject assets are not implemented effectively. \n \nThe Project includes measures to mitigate these risks. For the first \nrisk,  financial  eligibility  criteria  for  participating  municipal \ngovernments  during  preparation  as  well  as  procurement  and \ncontract  payment  procedures  during  implementation  will  ensure \ncounterpart  contributions  (i.e.,  representatives  from  MDF  and \nmunicipal  government  sign  contracts  and  disbursement \ndocuments).  For  the  second  risk,  the  capacity-development \ncomponent of the Project is designed to provide consulting services \ncovering  legal  and/or  technical  aspects  of  O&M  planning  and \nfunding,  including  measures  to  increase  cost  recovery,  tariff \ncollection, and metering. Any risk associated with overall project \nimplementation is mitigated by MDF\u2019s considerable experience in \nimplementing internationally funded projects. Moreover, ADB review \nmissions  will  monitor  these  mitigation  measures  and  ensure \nsustainability of the Project. \n ", "41 o 00'E 45o  00'E\nGEORGIA\nMUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nBzyb R.\nGagra\nABKHAZETI\nPitsunda\nOmarishara\nGudauta Lata Kodori R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Georgia for the Municipal Services Development Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The urban population of Georgia has remained stable at about 2.3 million, or about 52% \nof the total, from 2000 to 2006.1 Estimates for 2015 indicate little change. Most population \nmovements have been from smaller towns to larger centers, rather than from rural to urban \nareas. Because of the relatively stable urban population, government investment is to focus on \nthe  rehabilitation  of  deteriorating  basic  infrastructure.  For  many  years,  investments  in \ninfrastructure  assets  and  their  maintenance  were  neglected,  and  today  urban  areas  have \ninadequate water supply and sanitation, inefficient solid-waste management, and poor public \ntransport, and they lack basic road maintenance. Annual investments required to improve urban \ninfrastructure nationally have been estimated to be about $136 million,2 including $47 million for \nwater supply and sanitation.3  \n \n3.  Most urban water supply systems are more than 40 years old, and some date back to \nthe 1930s\u20131940s. Nearly all the water supply and sanitation infrastructure requires immediate \nrehabilitation simply to maintain a minimal level of service. Most of the pumps and equipment \nare now at the end of their usable life, and more than 50% of the water supply networks need \nmajor rehabilitation or replacement. Sewer pipes are broken and systems clogged. Only five out \nof  the  29  wastewater  treatment  plants  are  in  operation  and  these  are  limited  to  physical \n(mechanical) treatment; none of the biological treatment systems are in operation.  \n \n4.  Water supply and sanitation services are provided in all municipalities by 40 state-owned \nand four recently privatized utility companies. Service coverage varies significantly, with water \nsupply from 30% to nearly 100% and sewerage from 0% to 90%. Only a few consumers have \nsupply 24 hours and 7 days a week; others receive intermittent supply for 2\u20138 hours several \ntimes a week. The population not connected to a centralized water supply relies on local wells \nand springs. There is no regular water quality testing, and local laboratory facilities are largely \ndefunct because of the lack of investment since 1992.  \n \n5.  There is no reliable data on unaccounted-for water, but experience from a number of \nongoing rehabilitation projects shows that this ranges from 40% to 60%. Water charges remain \na political issue and tariffs are set at very low levels, which are often not sufficient to cover the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The billing collection rate is low at about 58%, and \nconsumption is high compared to other European countries.4 Since metering is limited and \nbecause of the low prices, poor payment discipline, and unreliable service provision, very few \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007.

Financing Strategy for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in \nGeorgia. Paris.) ", "2 \nwater supply companies (WSCs) are financially viable and most require government subsidies, \noften sourced by the municipal government. \n \n6.  All  municipalities  provide  solid-waste  collection  and  disposal  services,  although \ncoverage  varies.  Nevertheless,  solid-waste  collection  is  generally  inadequate  and  many \nvehicles are in very poor condition. Disposal sites are not properly designed and managed, \nresulting  in  the  pollution  of  underground  and  surface  water  bodies  and  the  surrounding \nenvironment. Most main roads in municipalities are in a reasonably good condition, although \nthey need improved drainage. Many secondary and tertiary roads need substantial surface \nimprovement as well as improved drainage; most roads are easily flooded.5 Public transport \nremains  a  serious  problem  in  many  municipalities  because  of  poor  road  conditions  and \nmanagement deficiencies. There has been some outsourcing of solid-waste collection and \ndisposal and road maintenance services through management contracts, but the poor condition \nof equipment and dilapidated infrastructure have prevented providers from improving services.  \n \n7.  In the late 1990s, the Government began to (i) decentralize municipal administrative \nresponsibilities, (ii) strengthen the legislative and regulatory framework for municipal services, \n(iii) restructure sector institutions, and (iv) mobilize financial resources for the improvement of \nmunicipal infrastructure. These reforms were undertaken in two stages. The first stage involved \nlocal  council  elections  and  better  identification  of  responsibilities  among  the  levels  of \ngovernment, and encouraged greater financial accountability. The second stage, undertaken in \nthe early 2000s, provided the legal and legislative framework to address issues that impeded \nthe functioning of the new local government system. This reaffirmed the rights and roles of \ncitizens\u2019 participation in local government and clarified the devolution of responsibility for local \nutility services. \n \n8.  There are now 69 municipal governments, including five self-governing cities whose \nmandates are outlined in the Organic Law on Local Self-Government (2006). The Law on Local \nBudgets  (2006)  sets  new  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  and  implies  better  consistency \nbetween the functions and resources provided to the local governments. It aims to ensure fiscal \nautonomy of local budgets and sets a clear mechanism for equalization of central transfers \nthrough a formula-based system. Actions in late 2007 have led to the centralizing of individual \nincome tax receipts (previously a major local revenue source for municipal governments) and \nthe enhancement of the central transfer system. These changes will reinforce the financial \ncontrol of the Government and will result in lower local revenues for all municipalities. \n \n9.  Most municipal governments are small and currently 62 municipal governments (90%) \nhave populations of less than 100,000; 34 municipal governments (49%) have fewer than \n40,000 people. Revenues too are low, and in 2007, half had total revenues of less than GEL3 \nmillion.6 Local tax revenues made up on average about 50% of the total in 2007, but when \nTbilisi is excluded the proportion fell to about 42%. The amounts, however, are low and five \nmunicipal governments had annual local revenues of less than GEL10 per capita in 2007; 57 \nmunicipal  governments  (83%)  collected  less  than  GEL100  per  capita.  Only  12  municipal \ngovernments have outstanding loans with MDF, and estimates show that between 14 and 18 \nmunicipal governments currently have the potential to borrow.7 A financial review of municipal \ngovernments is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n                                                 \n5 Most secondary and tertiary roads do not have side drains, or if provided they are not functioning properly. \n6 Figures provided by the Ministry of Finance. \n7 Source: ADB estimates. \n ", "3 \n10.  The management and use of water resources in Georgia is governed by the Water \nResources Law (1997, as amended in 2000). The central Government\u2014currently through the \nMinistry of Economic Development\u2014is tasked with developing sector policy, setting service \nstandards, and mobilizing financing. From November 2007, the approval of water tariffs became \nthe responsibility of the National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission.8 However, \nthe lack of tariff guidelines means that all pending increases are on hold. The basic principles \nthat tariffs should cover (i) operating, repair, rehabilitation, and maintenance costs; (ii) capital \nrecovery; and (iii) profit, have been established. The final guidelines are scheduled for approval \nin the fourth quarter of 2008.     \n \n11.  The Government\u2019s main goal is to improve people\u2019s living standards through better basic \nservices, particularly safe and reliable water supply and improved sewerage facilities. The first \npriority  is  to  rehabilitate  and  replace  deteriorated  equipment  and  works,  followed  by \nimprovements in the management of municipal services. The latter involves enhancing capacity \nwithin municipal governments and WSCs, focusing on (i) devolution, (ii) improving financial \nplanning  and  management,  (iii)  establishing  mechanisms  to  ensure  system  repair  and \nmaintenance, and (iv) engaging the private sector in the management and delivery of services. \nThese basic policy directions are unlikely to change, and are expected to be reflected in the \nfuture urban sector strategy.  \n \n12.  To improve the availability and use of development finance by municipal governments, \nthe Government established a Municipal Development Fund (MDF) under the World Bank\u2019s \nMunicipal Development and Decentralization Project (MDDP) in 1997. MDF was tasked to \nsupport (i) strengthening of the institutional and financial capacity of local governments, (ii) \ninvesting financial resources in municipal infrastructure and services, and (iii) improving the \nprimary economic and social services for the local population on a sustainable basis. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n13.  A major challenge for the Government is how to improve municipal infrastructure and \nservices in a sustainable way. Municipal infrastructure is deteriorating, coverage is inadequate, \nand poor levels of service delivery are common. Services are trapped in a vicious circle of poor \nperformance\u2014the tradition of subsidies has left tariffs and charges low, but the current poor \nservice quality means people are reluctant to pay more. Furthermore, payment discipline is lax \nand collection rates are low. In government, salaries are low, making it difficult to attract or \nretain staff and aggravating the problems of local skills shortages. This further weakens the \nability of municipal governments and WSCs to provide services. An analysis of urban sector \nproblems is in Appendix 1.   \n \n14.  Poor Municipal Service Provision. The Government does not have a national urban \nsector  development  strategy,  an  overall  urban  policy,  or  a  long-term  investment  program, \nalthough it does have an outline program for the water and sanitation sector prepared by the \nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.   \n \n15.  The lack of effective urban planning is also a problem. A number of municipalities have \ncity development plans, but most are inappropriate and outdated. They lack a vision for the \nfuture of the city, and do not include time-bound investment programs, spatial growth strategies, \n                                                 \n8  Previously the Georgian National Energy Regulatory Commission, with responsibility for regulating the electricity \nand natural gas industries, including the approval of tariffs. \n ", "4 \nor action plans for implementation. There is inadequate information on which to plan, and a lack \nof public participation in the planning process. \n \n16.  Interest  in  private  sector  participation  in  municipal  services  is  growing,  and  it  is \nunderstood that four WSCs have been privatized (those of Gardabani, Rustavi, Mtskheta, and \nTbilisi). The State Enterprise Management Agency under the Ministry of Economic Development \nis  preparing  all  WSCs  for  privatization,  including  proposals  to  amalgamate  some  of  the \nuneconomic  systems  within  the  smaller  municipalities  into  a  few  regional  authorities.  Low \nhousehold incomes limit the ability of the people to pay for economically priced services.  \n \n17.  Weak management and low technical capacity of municipal governments and WSCs is \nwidespread. Many have inadequate business planning systems, poor asset inventories, and \ngenerally  weak  management  procedures.  Funding  and  technical  capacity  constraints  limit \npreventive maintenance and lead to poor operational efficiencies. Unresponsive management \ninformation systems make financial and performance monitoring difficult. The uneconomic size \nof some municipal governments and WSCs also inhibits efficiency.  \n \n18.  Limited  Financial  Resource  Mobilization  Capacity.  Local  revenue  generation  by \nmunicipal governments and WSCs needs substantial improvement. Inadequate financing limits \nimprovements  in  service  delivery.  Most  municipal  infrastructure  is  financed  by  national \ngovernment grants, except within a few municipalities where there have been some loans from \nMDF, largely under the World Bank-funded MDDP. Neither MDF nor municipal governments \nhave  accessed  private  financial  and  capital  markets.  Internal  cash  generation  within \nmunicipalities and WSCs is poor because of low revenues\u2014low tariffs, charges, taxes, and \nrevenues, poor collection systems, and inadequate asset inventories or tax bases\u2014and an \ninability of many to borrow. Investment financing from the Government is limited.  \n \n19.  MDF directly implements subprojects. It has only just begun to develop its long-term \nvision for future operations but is still uncertain of its role in the municipal finance market. Much \nof this stems from the lack of strategic business planning and budgets, which lack a longer-term \nhorizon and are prepared on strictly financial lines for only 1 year. There is little experience \nwithin MDF for raising development finance and operating as a development bank, although it \nhas extensive project implementation experience. \n \n20.  In practice, MDF operates as a disbursement agency for international and local funds \nrather than as a financial intermediary. It has a number of project implementation units for these \nprojects and largely runs these as separate project implementation and/or management offices, \noften  with  different  funding  and  implementation  arrangements  for  each.  Actual  subproject \nimplementation, including bidding and award of contracts and supervision, is undertaken by \nMDF and not the borrowing municipal governments or WSCs. The MDF problem analysis is in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n21.  Opportunities. The above-mentioned problems will be addressed through intervention \nat the local level to improve service delivery by making more financing available and developing \nthe management, financial, and technical capacity of municipalities and WSCs. This calls for \ninterventions  to  (i)  provide  finance  for  the  rehabilitation  of  urban  infrastructure  and  urban \nservices though MDF, (ii) strengthen municipal governments and WSCs by increasing financial \nresource mobilization and technical capacity, and (iii) transform MDF into a more sustainable \nmunicipal financing institution.    \n \n ", "5 \n22.  Investments  for  rehabilitation  of  physical  infrastructure  are  also  a  key  element  of \nmunicipal  service  delivery.  This  will  prevent  deterioration  of  assets  and  bring  about \ndemonstrable improvements in performance in ways that are meaningful to customers. With a \nnumber  of  relatively  small  investments,  the  service  level  could  be  increased  substantially. \nMunicipal services affect the daily life of citizens, and improvements will be quickly perceived \nand recognized. Public awareness about the improvements, associated costs, and implications \ncan be further enhanced through proper campaigns, which can lead to the acceptance of tariff \nincreases and other financial reforms.  \n \n23.  The Project will focus on the improvement of basic municipal services by rehabilitating, \nrepairing, and extending the currently dilapidated infrastructure. It will also provide technical \nassistance to help the participating municipal governments and WSCs reform their tariffs and \ncharges and accounting, financial management, and reporting systems. Moreover, it will provide \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity development to the municipal governments and WSCs \nto ensure sustainable project benefits. \n \n24.  For the capacity development of MDF, the Project will focus on (i) raising and attracting \nsome financing from other sources beyond Government and international financial agencies, (ii) \nencouraging participation of financially weaker municipalities in the process of change, (iii) \nproviding financing to many small subprojects and allowing flexibility in subproject preparation \nand implementation, and (iv) providing opportunities for the project municipalities to attract \ncofinancing and private sector investment.  \n \n25.  Policy Dialogue. In support of the Project, policy dialogue involved (i) cost recovery, \ntariff reform, and privatization; (ii) improving the capacity of MDF and increasing lending to \nmunicipal governments; and (iii) a national urban sector road map. The policy dialogue will \ncontinue during implementation.    \n \n26.  The Government is formulating guidelines for water and wastewater tariffs and these will \npromote  the  economic  use  of  resources  and  meet  financial  objectives,  including  full  cost \nrecovery and profitability. However, to protect poor people from water tariff increases, most \nmunicipal  governments  have  implemented  a  social  assistance  or  minimum  living  standard \nscheme for households below the poverty line. While it is Government policy to prepare all \nWSCs for future privatization, polices for public\u2013private partnerships require strengthening.  \n \n27.  MDF needs to prepare a corporate plan that clearly sets a vision for the future and \nstrategies that lead to it becoming a more sustainable lending institution. To increase lending to \nmunicipal governments, it is essential to make the current decentralization efforts work better for \nmunicipal governments. There is a need to raise more revenue from local taxes, tariffs, fees, \nand charges, so that municipal governments become more financially independent. However, \nthere  is  a  large  number  of  very  poor  small  municipal  governments,  and  these  require \nstrengthening to better enable them to provide services and eventually become borrowers. The \ncentral transfer system, through the equalization formula, works well but there are still many \nother transfers that are applied on an ad hoc basis. More rationalization of the central transfer \nsystem is required. \n \n28.  A national urban sector strategy for Georgia is required in order to provide a vision or \nmission  for  the  sector,  identify  objectives,  and  include  an  action  plan  for  development.  A \nnational urban spatial strategy would form a key part of the strategy. How cities and towns fit \ninto this national strategy sets the context for future urban development including rehabilitation \nof basic urban infrastructure. The strategy should address the key issues of (i) investment \n ", "6 \nneeds and priorities, (ii) the alignment of government policies and actions, (iii) a financing plan, \n(iv) the definition of appropriate service standards, and (v) the identification of public\u2013private \npartnership opportunities. \n \n29.  External Assistance. To help the Government develop and improve basic municipal \nservices, external assistance has been provided by the World Bank, the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the \nEuropean  Union,  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  from  Canada,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  the \nUnited Kingdom, and the United States. The World Bank has participated in two MDDPs and a \nthird similar project is being prepared. EBRD has also financed several large water supply \nprojects, some of them cofinanced with MCC on a parallel basis. MCC is the largest bilateral \nsource of grant aid to Georgia and is involved in the rehabilitation of water supply, sewerage, \nand  irrigation  systems.  The  other  bilateral  aid  agencies  provide  technical  assistance  and \ncofinancing with multilateral financial agencies. The major ongoing programs and projects in the \nwater sector are described in Appendix 2. \n \n30.  The Project is ADB\u2019s first intervention in Georgia, and has built on the experience of \nother multilateral and bilateral financial institutions\u2019 projects. Cooperation with other agencies \nincluding the World Bank is critical, and the Ministry of Finance has taken the lead in ensuring \ncoordination. This will maximize benefits, avoid unnecessary and costly overlaps, and prevent \nconfusion in policy matters. The Project is designed to complement the third World Bank project, \nand  be  consistent  in  sector  policy,  capacity  development,  lending,  and  operational \nrequirements. Close coordination with the World Bank will continue during implementation.  \n \n31.  Lessons. This is ADB\u2019s first project in Georgia and the lessons learned from previous \nprojects financed by other international financial agencies are reflected in the project design. \nThese include (i) the importance of developing the capacity of municipal governments to identify \nand prepare investment projects, (ii) the need to link MDF operations to the decentralization \nstatus, and (iii) close coordination with other international financial agencies.   \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s three strategic focuses for Georgia9 are (i) improving service delivery in municipal \ninfrastructure  within  the  evolving  decentralization  process,  (ii)  reducing  road  transportation \nconstraints  on  economic  activity,  and  (iii)  upgrading  and  developing  energy  infrastructure. \nProper management of basic urban infrastructure and providing adequate municipal services \nare essential to sustaining levels of social development and enhancing the living standards and \nproductivity of the urban population. In the urban sector, ADB is focusing on (i) sector reforms to \nensure the sustainability of infrastructure assets, (ii) strengthening the link between financing \nlocal infrastructure and decentralization reforms, (iii) stimulating local economic development, \nand (iv) improving the quality of life of the urban population. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \ninterim operational strategy for the country (footnote 9). \n \n33.  Lending Modality. To date, the traditional forms of ADB intervention in the urban sector \nare the project loan, sector loan, and sector development program loan modalities.10 None of \nthese lending models appear to satisfy Government constraints and the requirements of the \nProject, the major component of which is the infrastructure project financing facility. Because a \nnew approach would be required, the Project has adopted the financial intermediation loan \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2008. Georgia: Interim Operational Strategy (2008\u20132009). Manila. \n10  ADB. 1999. Urban Sector Strategy. Manila. \n ", "7 \nmodality  as  the  best  fit. 11  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  standard  ADB  financial \nintermediation  loan  requirements 12 (the  participation  of  eligible  financial  institutions  and \ncommercial entities as well as relending and onlending arrangements) will not be applicable for \nreasons discussed below.   \n \n34.  MDF is not a financial institution. The Government has been using MDF (a special \npurpose vehicle, the sole purpose of which is to provide funds to municipalities on a grant or a \nmix of loan and grant basis) to finance the rehabilitation of dilapidated urban infrastructure. MDF \nis not a commercial entity. Since its establishment in 1997, MDF has been operating as a \nproject implementation and disbursing agency for funds provided under foreign-assisted and \nlocally funded projects. MDF has experience and necessary capacity for identifying, appraising, \nselecting, implementing, and monitoring development subprojects under well established rules, \npolicies, and procedures.   \n \n35.  End recipients of the ADB funds are not commercial entities. The Government needs to \nprovide scarce public resources to a wide range of municipalities, including those with limited \nborrowing capacity. The municipal governments are not commercial entities and they do not \nhave access to commercial finance. The Project will provide additional working capital to MDF \nto ensure it continues to meet the investment needs of municipal governments. This is the \ncurrent practice in Georgia and has been proven to be an effective mechanism for providing \nmunicipal governments with affordable long-term credit and the recovery of such investments. \n \n36.  The new approach will not distort financial markets. ADB loan proceeds will be provided \nby the Government to MDF entirely as a grant. The loan proceeds will then be onlent or \nongranted to end users at below market rates. However, this will not distort the financial markets \nas the end users under the Project do not have any access to commercial financing. Due \ndiligence of development subprojects to be financed under the investment component will be \ncarried out by MDF in accordance with established rules and procedures. \n \n37.  The potential risk associated with the new approach includes the lack of change within \nMDF to make it a more sustainable financing entity. This risk will be mitigated through the \nimplementation  of  a  time-bound  action  plan  under  the  Project.  The  capacity-development \ncomponent will provide the assistance needed to support the development of MDF\u2019s long-term \nvision, corporate strategy, and revised business model.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n38.  The expected overall impact of the Project will be an improved municipal environment \nand public health in Georgia. The outcome is improved municipal infrastructure and service \ndelivery. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n11 This approach is in line with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy, which advocates using a greater variety of lending \nmodalities given the rapidly changing context of financial markets. This will also contribute to promotion of \ndevelopment effectiveness by harmonizing ADB assistance with that of its partners and with country priorities and \nsystems. The World Bank has adopted a similar approach in Georgia under its two loans to MDF (MDDP I and II), \nwhich has proven to be effective. As a result, the World Bank is preparing a third project. \n12 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section D6/BP: Financial Intermediation Loans. Manila.  \n ", "8 \nB.  Outputs \n39.  The Project comprises two components: an investment projects financing facility, and \nproject management and capacity development. The output of the first component is increased \nquality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid-waste  management,  and \nroads. The indicative list of investment subprojects is in Appendix 4.   \n \n40.  The outputs of the project management and capacity-development component are (i) \nimproved capacity of municipal governments to prepare and appraise feasibility, engineering \ndesign,  environmental,  social,  and  other  related  studies;  (ii)  improved  capacity  in  project \nmanagement at municipal level; (iii) strengthened corporate and business planning processes \nwithin MDF; and (iv) improved capacity of MDF for conducting studies and training. \n \nC.  Special Features  \n \n41.  Reforms. The Project will address reforms aimed at decentralized service delivery and a \nmore sustainable MDF. These will be addressed under the capacity-development component of \nthe Project. In support of decentralized service delivery, the Project will help, on a pilot basis, at \nleast one municipal government identify, plan, prepare, and implement subprojects. This pilot \napproach, managed by MDF, will serve as a model for possible replication. The Project will \nassist MDF in becoming a more sustainable financing institution by addressing organizational \nand  operational  improvements,  including  (i)  expanded  lending  operations;  (ii)  resource \nmobilization; and (iii) a long-term vision, business plan, strategy, and investment plan.  \n \n42.  Value-Added Support by ADB. While MDF has evolved from multidonor support, the \nProject demonstrates ADB\u2019s value-adding in several key areas. The Project will enable MDF to \nimprove its operations and expand its lending over time. It will also encourage financially weaker \nmunicipalities to participate in the Project and in future help these municipalities borrow through \ntechnical assistance in order to improve local revenues and financial management.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n43.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $63.25 million equivalent. A summary of the \ncost estimates is in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.  Base Costa   \n  1.

Financing Plan \n \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $40.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The Government and municipal governments will finance $23.25 \nmillion (37%). The financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and details are in Appendix 5.   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  40.00    63 \nMunicipal Development Fund   10.20    16 \nMunicipal Governments  9.80    16 \nCentral Government  3.25    5 \n  Total    63.25    100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n45.  The Government will make the proceeds of the ADB loan available to MDF as a grant. \nUnder the investment projects financing facility, the proceeds of the ADB loan and MDF funds \nwill be passed on to eligible municipal governments. There will be two financing windows: (i) a \ncombination of loans and grants to the financially stronger or more creditworthy municipal \ngovernments,  which  have  the  capacity  to  borrow;  and  (ii)  grants  to  the  financially  weaker \nmunicipal governments, which have limited or zero capacity to borrow. Both windows will have \nthe same amount of ADB loan proceeds. \n \n46.  Under the first window, MDF will require that a minimum of 20% of the subproject cost \nbe contributed by a municipal government, and will finance the balance as a loan and a grant; \n50% of a subproject cost will be financed by a loan from MDF, and 30% as a grant from MDF. \nUnder the second window, 85% of a subproject cost will be financed by a grant from MDF and \nthe remaining 15% will be a contribution by the municipal government. ADB loan proceeds will \nbe used to finance the grant portion, plus 40% of the loan portion or 50% of a subproject cost \nunder the first window, and 85% of a subproject cost in the second window. MDF will finance \n60% of the loan portion under the first window (representing 30% of the subproject cost) from its \nown resources. It is able to provide the required resources for the Project from the accumulated \nrepayments of loans by the municipal governments. \n    \n47.  Eighty  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  project  management  and  capacity-development \ncomponent of the Project will be financed by MDF using ADB loan proceeds; the balance will be \nprovided  by  the  Government,  and  100%  of  the  incremental  administration  costs  of  MDF \nexcluding taxes and duties will be financed by ADB. The Government does not wish that the \ninterest during construction be capitalized and will finance this itself. The flow of funds is in \nAppendix 6. \n \n48.  Loans from MDF to municipal governments will be in lari and will be repayable in the \nsame currency over a period of up to 10 years, including a grace period of up to 1.5 years to \ncover the construction period. MDF will charge interest on these loans at 12% per annum to \ninclude provisions for defaults, costs of MDF administration and other operational expenses, \nand profit.  \n ", "10 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  MDF will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall implementation. MDF is a \npublic legal entity established by a public law in 1997. The main responsibilities include (i) \nproviding funds for development of municipal infrastructure and services, and (ii) strengthening \ninstitutional  and  financial  capacity  of  local  governments.  As  a  financial  intermediary,  MDF \nmobilizes funds from multilateral and bilateral financial institutions, international aid agencies, \nand  central  and  local  governments.  It  is  a  multidiscipline  organization  staffed  with  93 \nexperienced and qualified specialists, and it plans to increase staff numbers based on needs in \nthe near future. It has considerable capacity for project implementation and has performed well \nin implementing several foreign-funded projects. The details of MDF are in Appendix 7.  \n \n50.  A  detailed  description  of  the  arrangements  for  MDF  operations  for  project \nimplementation will be provided in the operations manual to be prepared by MDF. This manual \nwill include the policies and procedures to be followed during the implementation of the Project \nand  also  describe  the  rules  and  procedures  governing  MDF  business  activities  and  MDF \nrelations with its clients as they relate to financing of the Project. It was agreed that a single \nmanual will be prepared and used for the ADB and the World Bank projects.  \n \n2.  Selection Criteria for Municipal Governments and Subprojects \n51.  Eligible Municipal Governments. All municipal governments within Georgia are eligible \nto participate in the Project. MDF has developed the criteria to determine which municipal \ngovernments will be eligible to borrow under the first financing window, and which will be eligible \nfor  the  grant  window.  The  criteria  are  based  upon  the  creditworthiness  of  the  municipal \ngovernment, including its own revenues (local taxes, fees, non-tax revenues, capital revenues, \nand equalization transfer and grants), central transfers, expenditures, outstanding debts, and \nthe population of the municipality. \n \n52.  Eligible Investment Projects. Because of the nature of the Project, it is not possible to \ndetermine in advance the types of investment projects that will be financed. Nevertheless, a \npreliminary  pipeline  of  subprojects  has  been  discussed  and  it  indicates  the  need  for  the \nrehabilitation of municipal infrastructure and local utility services, in the following categories: (i) \nwater supply, including resource development and improvement; (ii) sewerage collection and \ntreatment; (iii) sanitation and solid-waste collection and disposal; (iv) local road improvement \nincluding drainage and street lighting; and (v) other municipal services. Subprojects for other \ncategories may  be  considered  by  prior  agreement  with  ADB.  General  eligibility  criteria  for \nsubprojects including ADB safeguards are in Appendix 8. \n \n53.  For municipal governments that can borrow, there will be no ceiling for subproject cost. \nHowever, for administrative purposes, the minimum cost of an investment subproject to be \nfinanced will be $500,000. Pooling of smaller but related and contiguous projects may be \nallowed to meet the minimum investment requirement. For the municipal governments whose \nsubprojects will be grant financed, the minimum subproject cost will be $100,000 and the \nmaximum $1,000,000. Any investment project falling outside these limits can only be considered \nwith prior consultation and concurrence with ADB. \n ", "11 \n3.  Investment Project Preparation and Appraisal \n54.  The investment project cycle follows that already in operation by MDF and comprises (i) \npreliminary review of the proposal and signing of project development agreement, (ii) carrying \nout required feasibility work, (iii) appraisal by MDF of the proposed investments, (iv) preparation \nof a financial proposal and request for approval by the MDF supervisory board, (v) signing of \nfinancing agreement with the municipal government or utility company, (vi) procurement and \nimplementation of the subproject, and (vii) monitoring and evaluation. Appraisal of investment \nprojects by MDF will be undertaken on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria to be \ndefined  in  the  operations  manual  and  will  cover  the  technical,  financial,  economic, \nenvironmental,  social,  and  institutional  aspects.  This  will  provide  adequate  justification  for \nacceptance or rejection for financing by MDF. The appraisal report for the first subproject and \nfor any subproject exceeding $2 million will be sent to ADB for approval on a no-objection basis. \nThe detailed steps for preparation and appraisal of subprojects and necessary studies to be \nprepared are in Appendix 9. \n \n4.  Implementation Period \n55.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from mid-2008 to mid-2013 (Appendix 10). \nThis is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place and \npreparatory works, including the operations manual, are underway. \n \n5.  Procurement \n56.  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for civil works that are \nestimated to cost more than $1 million equivalent and contracts for goods that are estimated to \ncost more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured using international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $1 million equivalent or less, and contracts \nfor procurement of goods estimated to cost between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent, will be \ncarried  out  through  national  competitive  bidding.  The  national  competitive  bidding  will  be \nconducted  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  State  Procurement  Law,  subject  to  the \nclarifications of the Law agreed to with ADB.  \n \n57.  Goods contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent will be carried out \nthrough  shopping  procedures.  Goods  valued  below  $10,000  and  civil  works  valued  up  to \n$10,000 may be purchased directly from the supplier and contractor. In such cases, ADB should \nbe satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. The award of all contracts will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB, except small contracts under the shopping and direct contracting procedures. \nExperience under the other projects implemented by MDF shows that it is able to handle \nprocurement effectively and in a timely manner. The procurement assessment report has been \nprepared by the World Bank and has determined MDF capable of handling procurement under \nthe similar project. Due to the nature of the Project, the scope of individual subprojects will be \nknown only during project implementation. However, estimates of required goods, works, and \nservices  have  been  carried  out  and  a  preliminary  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared \n(Appendix 10). This will be revised and updated annually or as needed throughput project \nimplementation. \n \n ", "12 \n6.  Consulting Services \n58.  The selection and engagement of consulting services to be financed under the Project \nwill be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and the procurement plan. The following methods of selection will be applied: (i) \nquality- and cost-based selection; (ii) quality-based selection; (iii) consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection for small consultancy assignments that cost less than $200,000 per contract; (iv) least \ncost selection for very small consulting assignments that cost less than $100,000; (v) fixed \nbudget selection; and (vi) single source selection and ADB individual consultant procedures for \nselection  of  individual  national  or  international  consultants  for  the  following  types  of \nassignments: environmental, social, tariff, and O&M studies. \n \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n59.  In  order  to  avoid  start-up  delays,  the  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  has \napproved,  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  recruitment  of  consultants  for \nfeasibility  studies,  detailed  engineering  designs,  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for \nsubprojects and associated civil works.13      \n \n60.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  Government  and  MDF  to  undertake  procurement \nprocedures, at its own risk, prior to the loan becoming effective. The Government and MDF \nwere informed that, for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be eligible for ADB\u2019s \nretroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the loan becomes \neffective, up to 20% of the amount may be used to finance eligible expenditures incurred, \npursuant to advance contracting, during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing the \nLoan Agreement. Alternatively, the Government and MDF may opt for advance contracting \nwithout  retroactive  financing,  in  which  case  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under \nadvance contracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the loan becomes \neffective.  The  Government  and  MDF  acknowledged  that  such  advance  contracting  will  be \nundertaken  at  their  own  risk,  and  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award of contract does not commit ADB to finance any such \nexpenditures or the Project. The ADB project team will orient Government and MDF staff \nregarding the Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n8.  Anticorruption Policy  \n61.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MDF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine project-related records and accounts of MDF, contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n                                                 \n13 This was reported in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 May 2008. \n ", "13 \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n62.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). MDF, as the Executing Agency, upon loan \neffectiveness  will  establish  and  operate  an  imprest  account  in  the  Treasury  or  a  bank \nacceptable to ADB. The imprest account will be exclusively used to finance the ADB share of \neligible  expenditures.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will \ndemonstrate that the works, goods, and services (i) were produced and procured from ADB \nmember countries, and (ii) were eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest account will not exceed the estimated project expenditures to be financed from \nthe imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To \nexpedite funds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures \nprocess  will  be  used  for  replenishment  and  liquidation  of  the  imprest  account  and \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures, not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. The \npayment in excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or \nreplenished based on the full supporting documentation process.      \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n63.  MDF will maintain a separate account for the Project acceptable to ADB. MDF will have \nits  account  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  statement  of \nsources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance with sound and internationally \naccepted auditing standards by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. MDF will \nsubmit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each financial year, (i) its audited \nfinancial statements, and (ii) the auditor's report relating to supplementary information on MDF's \naccounts, including an assessment of the quality of its long-term loans, the adequacy of the \nprovision  for  doubtful  loans,  and  MDF's  corporate  and  financial  governance  practices.  A \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures should be included in the audit report. Delay in submission of audited financial \nstatements of acceptable quality may result in ADB suspending loan disbursements. \n \n64.  MDF will provide ADB with (i) a quarterly progress report on project performance within 2 \nweeks after the end of each quarter that will include information on the loan funds utilization, \nsubloans and grants, procurement activities, and other matters relating to the Project; (ii) a \nprojected annual disbursement schedule, broken down by quarters by 15 December each year; \n(iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  the  loan  closing  date  detailing  project \nimplementation, project costs, subloan repayments, financial conditions of MDF,  and other \ndetails that ADB may consider necessary; and (iv) updated 3-year financial projections of MDF \nby 31 December each year. \n \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n65.  MDF will ensure that a project management and information system is maintained at the \nstart of project implementation. This will help monitor and evaluate the technical performance \nand  social  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  at  6-monthly  intervals.  The  performance \nmonitoring indicators and procedures will be established, and revised as necessary. At the start \nof the Project, MDF, together with participating municipal governments, will identify baseline \nindicators that focus on project municipal services delivery and financial capacity. \n \n ", "14 \n12.  Project Review \n66.  Review missions will be undertaken twice a year for the first 2 years and once a year \nthereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review 2 years after the project \nimplementation begins. This will include a detailed evaluation of the scope, implementation \narrangements,  and  progress  in  achieving  scheduled  targets,  and  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants. Feedback from the project processing monitoring system will also be analyzed. \n \nG.  Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \n67.  Background. MDF was established in 1997 under Presidential Decree Number 294 \u201cOn \nManagement of Funds Designated for the Development of the Municipal Sector in Georgia\u201d as a \nlegal entity of public law. It operates in accordance with its charter, the provisions of the Law on \nLegal Entity of Public Law of 1999, other relevant laws, orders, and decrees and in accordance \nwith agreements of the Government and a number of international multilateral and bilateral \nfinancial  institutions  and  its  various  operations  manuals.  MDF  is  a  government-owned \ncorporation, operates its own special and current accounts, prepares independent financial \nstatements, and has its own seal. Its head office is in Tbilisi.   \n \n68.  MDF is accountable through a supervisory board chaired by the prime minister and \nincluding nine other members: the ministers of Finance, Economic Development, Education and \nScience, and Agriculture; the heads of the Regional Issues Department of the State Chancellery \nand the Committee for Agrarian Issues of the Parliament; the deputy finance minister; and the \nexecutive  directors  of  the  Association  of  Young  Economists  (nongovernment  organization \nrepresentative) and the Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund. All members of the board are \nappointed and dismissed by the Government. MDF is headed by an executive director who \nreports to the supervisory board and there are four senior managers of departments of irrigation, \nsocial investment, investment and loans, and administration. \n \n69.  MDF was set up to support the strengthening of institutional and financial capacities of \nmunicipal governments by financing local infrastructure investments and capacity-development \nprojects. MDF disburses loans and grants to municipal governments using funds from other \ninternational financial agencies. MDF essentially functions as a project implementing agency for \na number of foreign-assisted and locally funded projects. Since 2002, MDF has generated it \nown revenue from loan repayments by municipal governments and is now relending some of \nthese funds. The total assets of MDF as at 31 December 2006 were about GEL46 million; loans \nto municipalities accounted for just over 70% of assets (GEL32 million). The accumulated \nsurplus or reserves (equivalent to government equity) amounted to GEL43 million (93%) of total \nnet assets and liabilities at the end of 2006. MDF has no outstanding long-term debt. It is a \nprofitable organization which in 2006 had a net income before tax of GEL3.4 million.  \n \n70.  Financial Management Assessment. A financial management assessment of MDF \nwas undertaken during the ADB mission. The Finance Department of MDF is well run with \nqualified and experienced financial specialists and accountants, and staff turnover is low. The \ndepartment is headed by the financial manager who is assisted by three staff who are well \nversed in the procedures and reporting requirements of international funding agencies, including \nthose of the World Bank, EBRD, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and Millennium Challenge \nGeorgia.  The  accounting  system  is  computerized  using  an  off-the-shelf  software  package. \nSpreadsheet  reports,  using  data  from  the  accounting  system,  however,  are  prepared  for \ninternational agencies rather than being an output of the system. There is a written financial \nmanagement manual that is regularly updated, most recently in January 2008. Financial reports \n ", "15 \nare prepared on time and are accurate; accounts for each project in 2007 were submitted to the \nauditor in February 2008.    \n \n71.  MDF uses commercial accrual-based accounting, has a standard chart of accounts, and \nreports according to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts are audited \nannually by an external private auditing company and for the past 3 years there have been \nunqualified audit reports. Adequate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of data. MDF \nhas no cash; all transactions are undertaken electronically through bank transfers. There is an \ninternal audit service unit comprising the head and a procurement auditor. Annual budgets are \nprepared on time and approved by the supervisory board. Monitoring of actual expenditures and \nbudgeted allocations is undertaken monthly but better linkages are required between physical \nand  financial  targets.  The  details  of  the  financial  management  assessment  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n72.  Based on the balance sheets and income statements projected for the period 2007\u2013\n2117, MDF has sufficient cash to support the required contributions to the Project, and also \ncontinues to be profitable. They also indicate that MDF needs to undertake more lending to \nmunicipal governments to ensure further growth in net income. Current lending programs are \nreaching completion and new ones (in addition to the Project) are needed.  \n \n73.  Reform Agenda. Following an internal workshop in January 2008, MDF has initiated the \npreparation of a strategic plan and, as an initial document, this represents a good start. The \nstrategic  plan  will  be  further  improved  following  the  recommendations  of  the  fiduciary \nassessment of MDF by the World Bank. The strategic plan will form the basis of a business plan \nto be prepared by MDF. It will also have a long-term vision for MDF that supports a financially \nsustainable entity, which over time will become less dependent on donor financing. Strategies \nwill be outlined and financial projections included. Action plans for the first 3 years of the plan \nwill be prepared. MDF will annually update its medium-term strategic plans including action \nplans. \n \n74.  Assistance is to be provided under the Project to help transform MDF into a more \nsustainable municipal financing institution. The major actions to be taken and the transition \nprocess are in Appendix 12. This involves developing MDF\u2019s long-term vision and business \nmodel  and  institutionalizing  strategic  and  business  planning  so  that  during  the  project \nimplementation period, annual business plans are prepared and executed. MDF will also include \na  plan  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  at  least  one  subproject  by  a  municipal \ngovernment in its 2009 business plan. A project implementation unit will be established in the \nparticipating  municipal  government.  Assistance  will  also  be  provided  to  develop  the  future \nmarket  for  MDF\u2019s  financial  operations  by  increasing  the  financial  capacity  of  municipal \ngovernments and utility companies. This will increase the number of potential borrowers. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic  \n \n75.  The Project will directly benefit the municipal population in terms of health and living \nconditions resulting from (i) a safer and more reliable water supply, (ii) improved environmental \nsanitation through better sewerage and solid-waste management services, (iii) time savings \nassociated with collecting water, and (iv) improved road conditions. The economies of these \nmunicipalities  will  benefit  indirectly  from  enhanced  productivity  as  a  result  of  health \nimprovements and increased efficiency resulting from improved roads and public transport. \n ", "16 \n \n76.  As a result of the rehabilitated systems, the Project will result in significant savings in \nmunicipal infrastructure O&M costs and more efficient O&M procedures. The Project will also \nhave a positive impact in terms of employment creation from the work involved in construction \nand rehabilitation, together with O&M. Training and technical assistance under the Project will \nenhance the productivity of municipal governments and MDF personnel. \n \n77.  A quantitative economic analysis could not be undertaken because it was not possible to \ndetermine in advance the participating municipal governments and the investment projects for \nMDF financing. Instead, an economic analysis framework (Appendix 13) has been prepared that \ncovers  the  scope  of  economic  analysis,  quantifiable  benefits  expected  from  each  type  of \ninvestment, identifiable externalities, and methodologies for conducting the economic analysis. \nThis will be incorporated into the operations manual to guide the economic analysis of each \nsubproject. All subprojects to be financed under the Project are required to demonstrate an \nexpected positive economic outcome in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines on economic analysis.14 \n \nB.  Financial and Institutional \n \n78.  Participating Municipal Governments and Local Utility Companies. The Project will \nbenefit about 20 municipalities through the provision of loans, grants, and technical assistance. \nThe  Project  reinforces  the  role  of  local  participation  that  will  enhance  accountability  and \ntransparency. It will help build capacity at the local level by providing hands-on training and \nspecialist  advice.  Capacity  development  of  municipal  governments  has  at  least  two  fiscal \nimpacts: (i) it encourages better cost recovery through more appropriate user charges that will \nrelease an equivalent amount of local revenue for other activities, and (ii) it enhances tax \nrevenue  generation  because  of  the  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  Project  will  help \nparticipating municipal governments improve their local revenues and financial management so \nthat more of them will be able to borrow in future.  \n \n79.  Municipal Development Fund. MDF will increase its exposure to structuring projects \nand ADB operations. Project support for coordination and implementation will increase the \ncapacity of MDF to manage fund flows and specialist services to municipal governments. As \nMDF's project portfolio grows, some additional training and technical assistance in financial \nmanagement  is  to  be  provided  so  that  MDF  can  transform  itself  into  a  more  sustainable \nmunicipal financing entity. The format of the audited annual financial statements will enable \nbetter disclosure of operating and administrative costs in the income statement. The provision of \nloans will strengthen the involvement of MDF as the prime agency in the municipal credit \nmarket. The Project will assist MDF to strengthen its financial mechanisms and operations. \n \nC.  Environmental  \n \n80.  The Project is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. The \nproject net environmental benefits are positive and these include (i) more and better drinking \nwater from water supply subprojects; (ii) better public health, particularly fewer waterborne \ndiseases,  through  water  supply,  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid-waste  management \ninvestments;  (iii)  improved  aesthetics  as  a  result  of  sewerage,  drainage,  and  solid-waste \nmanagement works; (iv) reduced flooding through drainage improvements; and (v) reduced \nexposure to suspended particles and noise pollution through urban transport and urban roads \ncomponents. The negative environmental impact during construction and operation will not be \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila \n ", "17 \nsignificant because (i) larger facilities will be built in low-density and nonsensitive areas, (ii) the \nworks are generally small in scale and can be quickly constructed, and (iii) simple technologies \nwith low maintenance requirements will have preference. However, exceptions may be made to \ninclude  some  environmentally  sensitive  investments  provided  that  the  needs  for  such \ninvestments are well justified. \n \n81.  A detailed description of the environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nfor the investment subprojects is in Appendix 14. ADB\u2019s environmental classification includes \nfour categories of projects depending on the significance of environmental impact: category A \n(covering projects that have significant adverse environmental impacts), category B (with lesser \ndegree or significance of environmental impact than those in category A), category C (covering \nprojects  that  are  unlikely  to  have  adverse  impact),  and  category  FI  (covering  financial \nintermediary projects). The Project is categorized as financial intermediary. For each investment \nsubproject, MDF and the municipal governments will be responsible for applying the prescribed \nEARF to (i) conduct environmental scoping, screening (including environmental categorization \nusing checklists provided by ADB), and assessment; and (ii) implement the environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) that ensures the adverse impacts are minimized and mitigated. \n \n82.  The Project may include investments which may have significant environmental impacts \n(i.e., category A) when the needs for such investments are well justified. The EARF has a \nnumber of additional requirements\u2014for category A subprojects, a full environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nguidelines,15 while only the initial environmental examination (IEE) is required for category B \nsubprojects.  The  EIA  is  more  comprehensive  and  rigorous,  and  involves  quantitative \nassessment of the baseline environmental conditions and predicted environmental impacts. In \nterms of requirements for public consultation, for category A investments MDF will ensure that \nconsultation will take place at least twice: once during the early stage of EIA field work, and \nonce when the EIA report is available. On the requirements for information disclosure, ADB\u2019s \n120-day rule16 requires that summary environmental assessment reports for a category A or a \ncategory B sensitive investment project are available to the general public at least 120 days \nbefore subproject approval by MDF or ADB, as appropriate. \n \nD.  Social \n \n83.  Inadequate municipal infrastructure and services contribute to urban poverty and social \ninsecurity in Georgia. The benefits in addressing municipal infrastructure and services deficits \nwill  be  (i)  significant  improvement  in  the  living  conditions  of  the  urban  population  due  to \nincreased availability of clean potable water and better environmental and sanitary hygienic \nconditions, and a reduction in waterborne diseases; (ii) improvements in economic development \nthrough encouraging investment and job creation; (iii) improvements in road safety and reduced \ntime and cost for traveling; and (iv) a reduction in the workload of women and children. \n \n84.  The  Project  is  expected  to  (i)  strengthen  public  trust  in  participating  municipal \ngovernments as a result of the rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure; (ii) improve access to \nmunicipal services by local populations, including the most vulnerable groups (women, children, \nand poor households); (iii) increase employment opportunities and incomes as a result of the \nrehabilitation of local infrastructure; and (iv) increase participation and ownership by municipal \ngovernments and communities. \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n16  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section F1/OP: Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Manila. \n ", "18 \n \n85.  The main stakeholders will be MDF, participating municipal governments, communities, \nand civil society organizations. MDF and participating municipal governments will ensure that for \nall  subprojects  the  results  of  social  assessments  and  stakeholder  consultations  will  be \nadequately taken into account in identifying investment priorities. Consultation will be carried out \nthrough public hearings, surveys, workshops, and other meetings during project implementation \nand monitoring. \n \n86.  MDF will be responsible for undertaking and providing adequate resources for project \nmonitoring, including social development outcomes. Indicators will be developed under the \nProject and will be included in the operations manual. The assessment of social issues cannot \nbe completed until the start of subproject feasibility. MDF will ensure that a social assessment is \ncarried out in cooperation with the participating municipality to (i) identify possible social issues, \nincluding gender, vulnerability, labor, affordability, and other social risks, if applicable; (ii) identify \nmeasures to avoid or minimize these risks; and (iii) ensure that the proposed subproject is \ntailored to the needs and priorities of the participating community as identified through the \nconsultation process.  \n \n87.  The  Project  will  not  trigger  ADB's  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  since \nsubprojects will mainly involve (i) the repair or rehabilitation of existing facilities located in public \nright-of-ways free of encroachment, and (ii) activities which are not expected to require land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR).  Any  subproject  involving  LAR  will  not  be  eligible  for \nfinancing. Each subproject will be approved only after it has been screened for LAR effects by \nMDF.  The  Project  will  also  not  trigger  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  since \ngenerally it is not expected to cause negative social impacts and specifically will not involve \npopulation fitting the policy\u2019s definition of indigenous peoples. In Georgia there are several \nminority groups but they are either in control of local political-economic systems or are not \nindigenous to the country. For equity purposes, MDF will ensure that, if a subproject is carried \nout in a multi-ethnic locality, its benefits are distributed among all local groups. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15.  \n \nE.  Risks \n \n88.  The potential risks associated with the Project include that (i) municipal governments are \nunable to provide required counterpart contributions for MDF investments, and (ii) arrangements \nfor the O&M of subproject assets are not implemented effectively. \n \n89.  The Project includes the measures to mitigate these risks. For the first risk, financial \neligibility  criteria  for  participating  municipal  governments  during  preparation  (as  well  as \nprocurement and contract payment procedures during implementation) will ensure counterpart \ncontributions (i.e., representatives from MDF and the municipal government will sign contracts \nand disbursement documents). For the second risk, the capacity-development component of the \nProject is designed to provide consulting services covering legal and/or technical aspects of \nO&M planning and funding, including measures to increase cost recovery, tariff collection, and \nmetering.  Any  risk  associated  with  overall  project  implementation  is  mitigated  by  MDF\u2019s \nconsiderable experience in implementing internationally funded projects. Moreover, ADB review \nmissions will monitor these mitigation measures and ensure sustainability of the Project. \n ", "19 \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n90.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MDF have committed to the \nfollowing, which will be incorporated in the Project\u2019s legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government, MDF, the participating municipal governments will make available \nand  release  in  a  timely  manner  all  counterpart  funds  necessary  for  project \nimplementation. \n(ii)  MDF will adopt the operations manual for the Project that will cover the policies and \nprocedures to be followed during project implementation and also describe the rules \nand procedures governing MDF business activities and its relations with its clients \nand as they relate to project financing. MDF will carry out the Project in accordance \nwith  the  operations  manual  and  will  ensure  that  no  revisions  to  the  operations \nmanual are made effective without ADB\u2019s prior approval. \n(iii)  Subprojects to be financed under the Project will meet the eligibility criteria set forth \nin Appendix 8.  \n(iv)  MDF will ensure that each investment project under the Project (a) is selected and \nappraised in accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria, and (b) carried out in \ncompliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Appraisal reports for the first \nsubproject and those estimated to cost more than $2 million will be submitted to ADB \nfor approval. \n(v)  EARF (as described in Appendix 13) will be followed during project implementation. \nSpecifically, the environmental assessment of subprojects will be conducted at each \nof  the  subproject  identification,  appraisal  and  implementation  stages;  subproject \ncategorization and screening shall be conducted by MDF following ADB agreed \nchecklist, EMPs for subprojects will be developed, as necessary; necessary permits \nand approvals will be obtained by MDF; necessary logistical and technical support \nfor conducting the assessments will be provided by municipal governments.   \n(vi)  Each subproject will be implemented in accordance with sound administrative, social, \nenvironmental, and governance principles. \n(vii)  All subprojects under the Project will be carried out within the existing right-of-ways \nand no subprojects will involve any land acquisition/resettlement that would trigger \nthe ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Any subproject that involves land \nacquisition/resettlement will not be eligible for ADB financing. \n(viii)  Social assessment of subprojects will be carried out in a socially responsible manner \nseeking mitigation of any potential social risks. \n(ix)  MDF will annually update its medium-term strategic plans including action plans. \n(x)  All  contracts  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine Project-related records \nand accounts of MDF, all contractors, consultants, and other service providers. In \nfurtherance of the principles of transparency, accountability and anticorruption, the \nMDF  will  enhance  and  further  develop  its  website  to  provide  the  public  with \ninformation  on  the  Project,  major  activities,  procurement  activities,  lists  of \nparticipating bidders and consultants, names of the winning bidders and consultants, \nbasic  details  on  bidding  and  recruitment  procedures  adopted,  amounts  of  the \ncontracts awarded, the list of goods/services purchased, and their intended use. \n(xi)  MDF  will  ensure  that  the  project  management  and  information  system  will  be \nmaintained within MDF and each of the participating municipal governments. At the \n ", "20 \nstart  of  the  Project,  MDF  together  with  participating  municipal  governments  will \nidentify baseline indicators that focus on project municipal services delivery and \nfinancial capacity.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Disbursement  \n \n91.  Unless ADB may otherwise agree, no proceeds will be disbursed from the loan account \nuntil: \n \n(i)  A duly executed Project Implementation Agreement between the Government \nand MDF have been submitted to ADB; \n(ii)  MDF has adopted the operations manual, satisfactory to ADB; and \n(iii)  MDF has submitted to ADB at least one appraisal report for a subproject, and the \nrelated Financing Agreement and Project Development Agreement entered into \nwith an eligible municipal government, on terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. \n \n92.  No withdrawals will be made for any subproject estimated to cost more than equivalent \nof $2 million until MDF has submitted to ADB the appraisal report for the subproject, in a form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n93.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  24,642,000  to  Georgia  for  the  Municipal \nServices Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n21 August 2008 \n ", "   \nURBAN SECTOR PROBLEM ANALYSIS \n \nPoor living  Environmental \nEffects Poor public health\nconditions degradation\nDeteriorating municipal infrastructure, inadequate coverage, and poor levels of \nCore Problem\nservice\nInadequate  Weak management \nInadequate policy  Lack of effective  Limited private  Inefficient provision \nCauses financing for urban  and technical \nsupport sector planning sector participation of urban services\nservices capacity of MGs \nLow tariffs, charges, \nInadequate legal  Inadequate business  Poor maintenance of \nlocal taxes, and \nframework planning local roads\nrevenues\nLack of national urban  Water supply\u2013lack of \nsector development  Inappropriate /  Inconsistent PPP  Poor collection  metering, high levels \nUneconomical size of  Poor asset inventories \nstrategy, policy,  outdated city/town  strategy for urban  procedures and  of UFW, wasteful \ninfrastructure systems and management\ninvestment program,  development plans services systems within MGs  consumption, and \nand  road map poor  quality\nIneffective tariff  Poor operational \nLack of city/town  Lack of sanitary solid \npolicies for water,  Ineffective sector  Inadequate asset data  efficiencies/lack of \ninvestment  waste disposal \nsewerage, and solid  regulation base  preventive \nprograms facilities\nwaste maintenance\nLimited and \nInadequate local  Lack of public  unsustainable  Unresponsive  Inadequate \nTechnical assistance \nrevenue generation  participation in  external  financial management  wastewater \nby USAID\n(MGs and WUCs) planning  financing/MDF  systems management\noperations\nTechnical assistance \nWB/EBRD/MCC \nby OECD, USAID,  Uneconomic size of \nUncreditworthy MGs  projects with different \nand policy dialogue in  some MGs \ngeographic focuses\nparallel with the \nproposed Project\nProposed Project A\np\np\nEBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, MCC = Millennium Challenge Corporation, MDF = Municipal Development Fund, MG = municipal government,  OECD = Organisation for Economic  e\nCooperation and Development, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, UFW = unaccounted-for water, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WB = World Bank, WUC = water utility company.    n\nd\nix\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.    1\n \n \n2\n1\n \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nMAJOR ONGOING PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS  \nIN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR \n \n      Cost \nInstitution  Project/Program  Description  (million) \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  This appendix summarizes the review of the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) of \nGeorgia, the Executing Agency for the Project. It starts with a background on the origin and legal \nbasis  of  MDF,  follows  with  an  outline  of  the  organizational  structure  and  management \nprocedures, continues with a review of MDF\u2019s activities and business procedures, and ends with \na brief financial assessment and projections of the financial statements for the next 10 years.  \n \nB.  Background \n \n2.  MDF was established on 7 June 1997 by the Government under Presidential Decree \nNumber 294 (On Management of Funds Designated for the Development of the Municipal \nSector in Georgia) as a legal entity of public law. It was set up to implement the first Municipal \nDevelopment and Decentralization Project (MDDP) financed by the World Bank. MDF\u2019s charter \nhas been revised since then on a number of occasions, when new projects were negotiated or \nactivities  transferred.1 The  latest  revision  was  under  Presidential  Decree  Number  118  (On \nApproval of the Charter and the Supervisory Board of the Municipal Development Fund) in 2005. \n \n3.  MDF operates in accordance with (i) its charter; (ii) the provisions of the Law on Legal \nEntity of Public Law of 28 May 1999; (iii) other laws, orders, and decrees; (iv) agreements of the \nGovernment and a number of international multilateral and bilateral financial institutions; and (v) \nits operations manual. MDF is a financially autonomous entity, operates its own special and \ncurrent accounts in a commercial bank, prepares independent financial statements, and has its \nown seal. Its head office is in Tbilisi and the financial year is from 1 January to 31 December. \n \n4.  The main responsibilities of MDF include (i) providing funds for development of municipal \ninfrastructure and services, and (ii) strengthening institutional and financial capacity of municipal \ngovernments. MDF functions as a project implementing agency for a number of foreign-assisted \nand locally funded projects. It accesses funds from multilateral and bilateral funding bodies, \ninternational  aid  agencies,  and  central  and  local  governments.  Foreign  funds  are  usually \nreleased to MDF through the Ministry of Finance as grants in the currency of the financer. MDF \nonlends  or  releases  these  funds  as  grants  in  lari  for  capital  investments  and  capacity \ndevelopment of municipal governments. MDF has extensive experience of, and considerable \ncapacity for, project implementation. It has performed well in implementing a number of foreign-\nfunded projects. \n \n5.  MDF is a government institution. It is neither a commercial nor a development bank; it \nreceives  no  customers\u2019  deposits  and  receives  most  of  its  funds  as  grants  from  central \ngovernment and through collection of loan repayments from municipal governments. It has no \noutstanding long-term debts.  \n                                                 \n1  For example, the charter was revised under Presidential Decrees Number 210 of 3 May 2002 and Number 409 of \n24 September 2002 to implement MDDP II. Under Presidential Decree Number 1027 of 6 December 2005 the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund was merged with MDF. Presidential Decree Number 246 of 8 June 2006 added \nthe Japanese Non-Project Grant. Later, under Presidential Decree Number 128 of 30 June 2006, the Irrigation and \nDrainage Consumers Organizations Development Project was merged with MDF. \n ", "    Appendix 7  29 \nC.  Organizational Structure and Internal Management Procedures \n \n  1.  Organization and Staffing \n \n6.  MDF is accountable to the Government through its supervisory board. Coordination and \noverall management of its activities is undertaken by the supervisory board appointed by the \nGovernment and chaired by the Prime Minister. The role and responsibilities of the supervisory \nboard are defined by decrees of the President of Georgia number 210 of 3 May 2002 and \nnumber 409 dated 24 September 2002. The latest composition of the supervisory board has \nbeen prescribed in Government of Georgia Decree Number 269, dated 5 December 2007 with \nthe prime minister as the chairman and nine other members2 all of whom are appointed and \ndismissed by the president of Georgia. MDF is headed by an executive director who reports to \nthe supervisory board and is supported by four senior managers of the departments of irrigation, \nsocial investment, investment and loans, and administration. MDF has a total of 93 employees \nas  of  mid-November  2007,  but  there  are  plans  to  increase  staff  numbers  based  on  the \nrequirements of new projects including that of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and on an \ninstitutional  assessment  to  be  conducted  in  the  near  future.  The  present  organization  and \nstaffing chart is shown as Figure 1. \n \n  2.  Management Policies  \n \n7.  Management policies are set out in several operations manuals prepared for different \nprograms. For example, MDF has an operations manual for the World Bank-funded MDDP, the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF) Project and the Regional Infrastructure Development \nProject (RIDP) of the Millennium Challenge Georgia. MDF does not have a core operations \nmanual, but the World Bank has agreed to harmonize its requirements with those of ADB \nthrough a joint operations manual. \n \n8.  The  operations  manuals  are  comprehensive  documents  and  set  out  MDF's \norganizational structure and internal management procedures covering a general overview of its \n(i)  activities;  (ii)  organizational  structure  and  staffing  plan;  (iii)  personnel  management \nprocedures,  involving  general  principles,  employment  contracts,  professional  responsibility, \nconflict of interest, and code of behavior; (iv) financial management, and (v) reporting. They also \ndetail MDF's activities and business procedures, including (i) the nature of business products; (ii) \ninvestment project financing and technical assistance financing; (iii) investment financing; (iv) \neligibility  criteria  for  projects  and  entities;  (v)  project  preparation  cycle;  (vi)  project \nimplementation, covering procurement guidelines, implementation supervision, and monitoring \nand  evaluation;  and  (vii)  project  financial  management  focusing  on  special  accounts,  local \ncurrency accounts, and accounting procedures. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  These are (i) the ministers of Finance, Economic Development, Education and Science, Agriculture, and Regional \nAffairs; (ii) the head of the Committee for Agrarian Issues of the Parliament; (iii) the deputy ministers of Finance and \nRegional  Affairs;  and  (iv)  the  executive  directors  of  the  Association  of  Young  Economists  (nongovernment \norganization representative) and of the Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund.   \n ", "30  Appendix 7   \n \nFigure A7: Organization and Staffing Chart of the Municipal Development Fund \nSupervisory Board\nExecutive Director\nAssistant Head, Internal Audit\nInternal Audit Specialist\nHead, Irrigation  Manager, Social Investment  Manager, Investment and  Manager, Administration \nDepartment Department Loans Department Department\nSecretary Assistant  Public Relations  Assistant\nSpecialist-Assistant\nManager, CIUAD Head, SIP Division Head, Technical  Manager, Finance \nDepartment Department\nCoordinator (2) PM Specialists (2)\nWork Supervisors (6) Financial and \nSupport Specialists (5) Financial and Economic  Economic Analyst\nAnalyst Head, PMMD\nMonitoring Specialist  Chief Accountant\nMonitoring Group  Senior PM \nHead, Technical  Coordinator Specialists (2) Accountants (3)\nDepartment\nMonitoring Specialists  Interpreter Head, IT \nWork Supervisors (4) (6) Department\nHead, PMMD Interpreter IT Chief Specialist\nHead, Technical  IT Specialists (2)\nSenior PM Specialists (2) Department\nLawyer\nPM Specialists (2) Work Supervisors (13)\nChancellery\nInterpreter\nHead, Procurement \nDepartment\nSenior Procurement \nSpecialists (2)\nProcurement \nSpecialists\nHead, \nAdministrative \nSupport\nAdministrative Support \nOfficers (3)\nDrivers (7)\nCleaners (4)\nCIUAD=CommunityIrrigationUsersAssociationsDepartment,PM=projectmanagement,PMMD=projectmanagementandmonitoringdepartment,IT=information\ntechnology, SIP = social investment project.\nSource: Municipal Development Fund.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 7  31 \n9.  Also, a well-drafted and comprehensive financial management manual (updated January \n2007) is in use by the Finance Department. This outlines (i) the organizational management \nstructure, roles, and responsibilities for financial management; (ii) the legal requirements for \nfinancial reporting, and internal regulations for things such as time sheets, vacation and sick \nleave,  travel  allowances,  and  vehicle  expenses;  (iii)  flow  of  funds  arrangements,  including \nspecial account operational procedures and flows of documents; (iv) budgeting procedures, \nincluding the time frame and responsibilities; (v) the accounting system covering objectives and \nprinciples, accounting policies and rules, loans, payroll processing, and a description of the \ncomputerized accounting system and the treatment of operational expenditures; (vi) financial \nreporting and monitoring, describing reports to be produced and their frequency; (vii) internal \ncontrol procedures that set out the principles, appropriate documentation of policies, separation \nof  functions,  fixed  asset  control,  and  pay  and  payroll  matters;  and  (viii)  external  control, \nprescribing the annual audit and selection of auditors, and the requirements of financers and the \nGeorgian authorities. \n \n  3.  Financial Management Assessment \n \n10.  A financial management assessment of MDF was undertaken using a questionnaire and \ninterview approach. It focused on the finance and internal audit departments. Supplementary \nAppendix C provides a summary of the assessment together with the completed questionnaire \nand details of each member of the finance and internal audit staff, key qualifications, experience, \nresponsibilities, and supervising arrangements. \n \n11.  The Finance Department of MDF is well run with qualified and experienced financial \nspecialists and accountants; staff turnover is low. The department is headed by the financial \nmanager who is assisted by three staff well versed in the procedures and reporting requirements \nof  international  funding  agencies,  including  those  of  the  World  Bank,  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Reconstruction  Credit \nInstitute),  and  Millennium  Challenge  Georgia.  For  example,  for  MDDP  II,  the  World  Bank \nrequires that annual financial statements be audited each fiscal year in accordance with the \nInternational Standards on Auditing and that separate audit opinion is required for all. For the \nMDDP II these comprise (i) a summary of sources and uses of funds showing the World Bank \nand counterpart funds, including contributions in kind, separately as of the end of each fiscal \nyear; (ii) a summary of uses of funds by project activities (statement of expenditure detail) as at \nthe end of each fiscal year; (iii) a balance sheet; (iv) a statements of expenditures withdrawal \nschedule for each fiscal year; and (v) a special account statement for each fiscal year. Annual \nfinancing statements for MDF comprise (i) a balance sheet as at the end of each fiscal period, \n(ii) an income statement for each fiscal year, (iii) a cash flow statement for each fiscal year, and \n(iv) a funds flow statement for each fiscal year. MDF has no difficulties in producing these \nreports on time. \n \n12.  The accounting system is computerized using an off-the-shelf software package from the \nRussian  Federation.  With  the  merger  of  GSIF  and  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Community \nDevelopment  Project  subprojects  with  MDF  in  2006,  there  were  three  different  accounting \npackages in use.3 Late in 2006, MDF opted for one package, and from 1 January 2007 all \ndepartments have been using the latest version of 1C Accounting. Spreadsheet reports, using \ndata from the accounting system, however, are prepared for international agencies rather than \nbeing an output of the system. There is a written financial management manual that is regularly \n                                                 \n3  The Municipal Development Fund used Oris, the Irrigation and Drainage Community Development Project used a \nself-made system based on Cooper software, while GSIF used an older version of 1C Accounting. \n ", "32  Appendix 7   \n \nupdated,  most  recently  in  January  2008.  Financial  reports  are  prepared  on  time  and  are \naccurate; unconsolidated accounts for each project in 2007 were submitted to the auditor in mid-\nFebruary 2008. \n \n13.  MDF uses commercial accrual-based accounting, has a standard chart of accounts, and \nreports according to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts are audited \nannually by an external private auditing company, and for the past 3 years there have been \nunqualified audit reports. Adequate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of data. MDF \nhas no cash; all transactions are undertaken electronically through bank transfers. There is an \ninternal audit service comprising the head and a procurement auditor. Annual budgets are \nprepared on time and approved by the supervisory board. Monitoring of actual expenditures and \nbudgeted allocations is undertaken monthly but better linkages are required between physical \nand financial targets. \n \n14.  MDF is a project implementation and disbursement agency for funds of foreign-assisted \nand locally funded projects. It is neither a commercial bank nor a development bank, has no \ndeposits, and receives all of its funds as grants from central government. It has no outstanding \ndebts. Most of its funds are passed on to municipal governments as grants, although it has \nprovided  some  loans  to  creditworthy  municipalities  under  the  World  Bank  MDDP  I  and  II \nprojects. Assistance proposed under the Project will improve its business model, corporate \nobjectives, and strategy. \n \nD.  Programs, Loans, and Business Planning \n \n  1.  Major Programs \n \n15.  The objective of MDF is to support the strengthening of institutional and financial capacity \nof municipal governments by (i) investing financial resources in local infrastructure and services, \nand  (ii)  improving  on  a  sustainable  basis  primary  economic  and  social  services  for  local \ncommunities. It accomplishes this by financing local infrastructure investments and capacity-\ndevelopment projects. In 2004, MDF disbursed loans and grants of about GEL3.8 million; in \n2005 this increased to GEL23.5, and in 2006 to GEL70.3 million. Estimates for 2007 are that \nGEL50.4  million  will  be  disbursed.  Funds  have  been  sourced  from  the  World  Bank,  the \nMillennium Challenge Cooperation, and other international financial agencies. Since 2002, MDF \nhas generated it own revenue from loan repayments by municipal governments and is now \nrelending some of these funds. \n \n16.  The first major project of MDF was the World Bank-funded MDDP I that involved the \nfinancing of 89 investment projects. MDDP II followed and provided investments and supporting \ntechnical assistance to more than 20 municipal governments. In 2005, the GSIF merged with \nMDF, expanding MDF\u2019s activities into social infrastructure rehabilitation. Under GSIF I and II, \nrehabilitation  works  of  $29.3  million  were  carried  out,  largely  for  education  facilities.  Both \nprojects involve World Bank and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau financing. \n \n17.  Since  2005,  MDF  has  been  implementing  the  $60  million  RIDP  financed  by  the \nMillennium  Challenge  Corporation.  This  includes  rehabilitation  works  in  water  supply  and \nreservoirs, and irrigation system improvements. The RIDP is scheduled for completion in 2010. \nMDF,  with  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  the  Science  Ministry,  is  also  implementing  the \nEducation System Realignment and Strengthening Program 2, financed by a World Bank loan of \n$15  million.  Recently,  under  the  Japanese  Non-Project  Grant,  $2  million  equivalent  was \nallocated to MDF to finance the acquisition of equipment for basic infrastructure services by \n ", "    Appendix 7  33 \nmunicipal  governments.  In  2006,  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Consumers  Organizations \nDevelopment Project was transferred to MDF. \n \n18.  MDF is currently negotiating with the World Bank for a further $10 million loan to finance \nthe extension of MDDP II. The arrangements will be the same, where the World Bank finances \n60% of the project cost and MDF and municipal governments equally finance the balance. The \ntotal project cost is estimated to be $16.7 million and of this 40% ($6.7 million) will be released \nas loans to municipal governments. It is expected that this project will start in mid-2008 and will \nbe implemented over 3 years.    \n \n  2.  Operating Modality \n \n19.  Capital  investments  of  MDF  follow  a  clearly  defined  project  cycle  that  matches  the \nrequirements of international financing agencies. This investment project cycle comprises the \nfollowing steps: (i) preliminary review of the proposal and carrying out of required feasibility \nwork, (ii) approval by MDF of the proposed investments, (iii) preparation of a financial proposal \nand request for approval by the MDF supervisory board, (iv) procurement and implementation of \nthe Project, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Project or financing agreements are entered into \nby MDF and the concerned municipal government, and once a loan project is completed and \nfinal costs are known a formal loan agreement is signed. \n \n20.  MDF short-lists contractors or suppliers, requests bids, selects the winning contractor or \nsupplier, and approves and disburses progress payments. Municipal governments are involved \nthroughout this process and sign off on all contract approvals and payments. Participating \nmunicipal governments are required to pay their contribution to MDF before the commencement \nof the construction contract. Upon completion of each subproject MDF turns over the assets to \nthe concerned municipal government for operations and maintenance and, where appropriate, \nsets up a loan account for repayment by the municipal government.  \n \n3.  Lending Operations \n \n21.  To date MDF has made loans to 13 municipal governments, one of which has repaid in \nfull, and the outstanding balances of the others at 31 December 2006 was GEL32.3 million. \nLoans are not secured but payments are enforced through the legal system, if necessary. \nPenalties are charged for late payments at 0.06% per day of arrears on the amount due.4 \nCollection rates are generally good and 10 municipal governments are paying regularly on time. \nTwo,5 however, are in arrears, and discussions are taking place to resolve the problems, which \nare inherent in the limited local budgets of both. Nevertheless, the two municipal governments \nwill  be  paying  once  resources  become  available.  One  loan  (to  Ozurgeti  municipality)  was \nsuspended because the municipal government refused to sign the final hand-over agreement on \naccount  of  questions  on  disbursements.  The  loan  amount  cannot  be  agreed  upon.  It  is \nunderstood that the problems are now being resolved and the loan will be reinstated soon. The \nonly other problem was with Kazbegi municipality which did not pay; however, after legal action \nby MDF, the loan is to be repaid.  \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Loans are due from the 25th to the end of each month. Any payment received during this period is considered \ncurrent. Payments after this date are considered in arrears and charged the daily penalty from the 25th to the actual \ndate that payment is received by MDF. \n5  As at 21 November 2007, the arrears for Ambrulauri were GEL147,356 and for Samtredia they were GEL13,483. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 7   \n \n4.  Business Planning \n \n22.  MDF does not have an approved corporate or business plan, but undertook a planning \nexercise in January 2008. The output of this workshop was submitted to ADB and is to be the \nbasis of a business plan to be prepared by MDF on or before 31 December 2008. The plan will \nmodify the long-term vision for MDF, targeting a more financially sustainable entity. Outline \nstrategies  will  be  refined  and  more  comprehensive  financial  projections  prepared.  Detailed \naction plans for the first 3 years of the plan period will be included. \n \nE.  Financial Performance and Projections \n \n  1.  Financial Performance \n \n23.  The total assets of MDF as at 31 December 2006 were GEL45.8 million, increasing from \nGEL30.3 million at the end of 2005. Loans to municipalities accounted for just over 70% of \nassets (GEL32.3 million) at the end of 2006, an increase from GEL24.8 million (almost 81% of \ntotal assets) at the end of 2005. An accumulated surplus of GEL42.5 million represents 93% of \ntotal net assets and liabilities at the end of 2006, against GEL28.9 million (95% of total net \nassets and liabilities) at the end of 2005. MDF has no outstanding long-term debts, and has not \nborrowed.6 \n \n24.  Total revenue in fiscal year of 2006 was GEL83.1 million, an increase over the GEL32.3 \nmillion for 2005. But this is deceptive, since most (i.e., GEL78.5 million in 2006 and GEL29.3 \nmillion in 2005) is related to transfers from project financers\u2014funds released by these agencies \nfor project development expenditures. Interest income amounted to GEL4.6 million in 2006 \nagainst GEL3.0 million in 2005. When set against operating expenses of GEL1.2 million in 2005 \nand 2006, there was a net profit before tax of GEL3.4 million in 2006 and GEL1.8 million in \n2005. \n \n25.  MDF has not prepared long-term financial projections, and the only forecasts of revenues \nand expenditures are made for the annual budget. Latest estimates for the 2007 budget indicate \ntotal expenditures of GEL59.6 million, of which 76% is for Millennium Challenge Georgia, the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, GSIF, and the Irrigation and Drainage \nCommunity Development Project. Funding for 2007 is largely from grants7 and cofinancing \n(86%), but interest income and principal loan repayments are estimated to contribute 11% of \ntotal financing. The 2008 budget has been prepared and approved.    \n \n2.  Projected Financial Statements, 2007\u20132117 \n \n26.  To establish the likely financial results over the Project period, financial projections were \nprepared with the assistance of MDF. The results are summarized in Table A7 and show that \nMDF has sufficient cash to support the required contributions to the Project and it realizes an \nannual net profit over the period. Sensitivity tests involving different capital investment programs \nand varying the grant-loan ratios for municipal government projects show that it is essential for \nMDF to undertake more lending so that the interest earned continues to grow. Current lending \nprograms are reaching completion and new ones are needed. \n                                                 \n6  To date all proceeds of loans from international funding agencies have been released to MDF as grants and in local \ncurrency. \n7  Including proceeds of foreign loans to the Government of Georgia, but released to MDF as grants. \n ", "    Appendix 7  35 \n27.  To  project  MDF\u2019s  financial  statements  (balance  sheets  and  income  statements),  a \ncomputer model was developed and tested. Projections were made from 2007 to 2116, using \nbase data as supplied by  MDF that supplemented the closing account balances as at 31 \nDecember 2006.8 Financial statements for 2007 were projected through the input of the latest \n2007 budget forecast as provided by the head of the Finance Division. \n \n28.  The following were the key assumptions used to project the financial statements. \n \n(i)  Property, plant, and equipment. Future investments for computers, vehicles, \noffice equipment, and furniture were assumed to be GEL0.212 million for 2007, \nGEL0.1 million in 2008 and beyond but adjusted for inflation. \n(ii)  Investment program. MDF has a number of ongoing programs9 but at this stage \nit was not possible to establish projections of sources and applications of these \nfunds. Apart from the investment figures of all programs for 2007, the ADB project \nwas input according to the project financing plan, along with assumptions made \nfor the proposed World Bank-funded MDDP III.10  \n(iii)  Salaries  and  other  operating  expenses.  Increases  in  salaries  of  7%  were \nassumed for 2008 to account for the changes in withholding taxes and for the \nnew staff to be hired for the ADB project. Thereafter, an annual rate of growth of \n3%  (half  the  inflation  rate)  was  assumed.  Other  operating  expenses  were \nassumed to increase at 5% per annum. \n(iv)  Loan  repayments  from  municipalities.  Although  MDF  generally  has  100% \ncollection rates, some slippage has been introduced in the model and a collection \nrate of 95% was assumed. New loans were restricted to those under the ADB \nproject,  the  proposed  new  World  Bank  loan,  and  the  Japanese  Non-Grant \nProject. All of these were phased according to the likely disbursement plans for \nthe projects. \n(v)  Inflation. An annual rate of 6% per annum from 2007 to 2016 was used. \n(vi)  Income tax. Calculated at 20% of net income for the year. \n \nF.  Conclusions \n \n29.  Past financial statements and projections show that MDF has adequate funds for its \noperations. Since 2004, MDF\u2019s current assets are about 5 times current liabilities, and there has \nbeen an annual profit. Loans made by MDF to municipal governments are being repaid, mostly \non time. Annual financial statements are externally audited by private auditors and MDF has \ndetailed operations manuals together with a comprehensive and updated financial management \nmanual. The operations manuals describe the organizational structure and internal management \nprocedures, the rules governing its business activities and its relations with its clients, mandatory \nreporting  requirements,  operating  procedures,  and  credit  and  risk  management  policies. \n                                                 \n8 Those recorded in the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia, Independent Auditor\u2019s Report, Financial Statements \nfor the year ended 31 December 2006, August 2007. \n9  Final payments under MDDP II; continuation of the Social Infrastructure Project, the RIDP of MCG and EBRD, the \nIrrigation and Drainage Community Development Project, the Japanese grant for the purchase of equipment (such \nas garbage skips, and tractors) for municipal governments, and the Education Realignment and Strengthening \nProgram. Only the Japanese grant-funded project involves new loans to municipal governments; all other projects \ninvolve either grant releases or, under the RIDP where funds flow directly from EBRD and MCG to contractors and \nsuppliers, processing of invoices and monitoring by MDF. \n10 The World Bank projects follow the same financing principle as the ADB project\u201450% of the cost of municipal \ngovernment subprojects is financed as a loan, 30% as a grant, and the remaining 20% represents the contribution \nof the municipal governments. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 7   \n \nFinancial procedures are specified in the financial management manual. The supervisory board \napproves loans to municipal governments and the terms and conditions\u2014interest rates and \nrepayment periods. The manuals and the experience of the World Bank and other foreign-\nassisted projects show that MDF has adequate policies, systems, and procedures to assess and \nmonitor the economic, social, and environmental impact of subprojects. \n \n ", "   \nTable A7: Municipal Development Fund, Actual and Projected Balance Sheets and Income Statements, 2004\u20132017 \n(GEL million) \nBalance Sheet 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash and Cash Equivalents     4.37     2.51     9.92   11.40   15.71   17.84   18.31   19.16   22.04   26.29   33.16   39.49   43.44   46.99\nCurrent Portion of Loans to Municipalities     1.97     2.30     2.97     3.59     4.23     4.91     6.14     4.74     5.84     6.50     6.56     4.95     5.25     5.86\nOther Current Assets     0.08     2.91     3.03     4.08     2.95     3.27     3.81     4.18     2.91     1.52     0.66     0.32     0.18     0.12\nTotal Current Assets   6.43   7.72 15.92 19.06 22.90 26.02   28.27 28.08 30.79 34.32 40.38 44.76 48.86 52.97\nNoncurrent Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net     0.05     0.06     0.53     0.63     0.58     0.54     0.49     0.44     0.38     0.33     0.27     0.21     0.14     0.07\nLoans to Municipalities, Portion\nADB Project     0.35     2.18     6.08   12.03   18.12   19.85   18.59   16.63   14.44\nOthers   14.98   22.52   29.33   25.86   25.00   23.22   25.59   31.48   34.55   31.00   25.87   22.57   19.06   15.13\nSubtotal   14.98   22.52   29.33   25.86   25.00   23.57   27.77   37.56   46.58   49.12   45.72   41.16   35.69   29.57\nTotal Noncurrent Assets 15.03 22.58 29.86 26.48 25.59 24.11   28.26 38.00 46.97 49.45 45.99 41.36 35.83 29.63\nTotal Assets 21.46 30.31 45.78 45.55 48.48 50.12   56.53 66.07 77.76 83.77 86.37 86.12 84.69 82.61\nNet Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nRetentions on Project Expenditure     0.13     0.90     2.76     2.76     3.00     3.76     4.17     4.33     3.94     3.06     2.76     2.76     2.76     2.76\nPayables      -

The Project will focus on subprojects with no significant3 adverse environmental impacts. \nHowever, in some exceptional cases where the needs for financing environmentally sensitive \nprojects, e.g., landfill sites, are well justified, the Project can include such investments provided \nthat both ADB and the Government\u2019s environmental assessment and management procedures \nare strictly followed, and environmental risks are minimized to an acceptable level as a result of \na properly assessed and planned mitigation program. More details on environmental safeguards \nprocedures are provided in Appendix 14. \n \n8.  No subproject that involves involuntary resettlement will be eligible for financing.  \n \n                                                 \n2  This is based on the assumption of debts of GEL1 million, with an average interest rate of 12% per annum and an \naverage repayment period of 10 years with a 1-year grace period.  \n3  For the environment, significant means any subproject classified as category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental guidelines (Source: ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines, Manila). \n ", "40  Appendix 9   \n \nINVESTMENT PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL \n \nA.  Investment Project Preparation and Appraisal \n \n1.  Preparation and appraisal of an investment project by the Municipal Development Fund \n(MDF) will involve the following steps. \n \n2.  Step 1. The participating municipal government applying for the financing of a specific \ninvestment project submits a request to MDF for financing, together with a project summary, the \nform of which will be provided in the operations manual to be prepared by MDF.  \n \n3.  Step 2. MDF reviews the financing request with a view to determining whether \n \n(i)  the proposed subproject is consistent with MDF financing principles; \n(ii)  the  applying  municipal  government  is  eligible  for  funding  under  window  one \n(loan-grant-cofinancing  combination)  or  window  two  (grant-cofinancing \ncombination); \n(iii)  the  applying  municipal  government  has  the  necessary  borrowing  capacity  if \nfunding is to be under window one; \n(iv)  documentation available for the subproject is sufficient for preparation of the \nsubproject summary report (SSR); \n(v)  the  proposed  project  will  require  any  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement;1 and \n(vi)  The proposed project will have significant adverse environmental impacts or \nhave an environmental category A (determined using the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s [ADB's] rapid environmental assessment checklists2).  \n \n4.  Step  3. The proposed subproject will be deemed unsuitable for MDF financing if it \nrequires any land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. If the project is deemed unsuitable \nfor MDF financing, MDF notifies the municipal government of the rejection of the request. \n \n5.  Step 4. MDF prepares the SSR for financing window two subprojects and the SSR \nprovides information on (i) short description of the proposed subproject, (ii) investment plan \n(amount of the proposed investment and structure), (iii) financing plan (subloan amount, terms, \ngrant,  amount,  and  cofinancing  need),  (iv)  description  of  all  possible  benefits,  and  (v) \nimplementation arrangement. \n \n6.  Step 5. For window one subprojects,3 MDF prepares the subproject appraisal report \n(SAR). If documentation is deemed insufficient to prepare the SAR, MDF agrees with the \nmunicipal  government  on  the  scope,  terms  of  reference,  implementation  conditions,  and \nschedule of required feasibility, design, and other complementary studies and assessments \nrequired for project appraisal. The SAR provides information on (i) the scope of the subproject; \n(ii)  investment  and  financing  plans;  (iii)  environmental  screening;  and  (iv)  environmental, \neconomic, financial, social, and other benefits and risks. To provide the information, the SAR \nshould answer the following questions. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB defines involuntary resettlement as social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are \ncaused by (i) acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on \nland as a result of an ADB operation. \n2  ADB. 2003.

Have they been \nadequately determined and evaluated? \n(xvi)  Was the economic evaluation methodology that has been used appropriate? \nHow have the costs and benefits been calculated? Are the results allowed to \nmake valid judgment in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines on economic analysis?4 \n \n7.  Step 6. If the SAR or the SSR is accepted by the MDF supervisory board, MDF sends it \nto ADB. \n \n8.  Step 7. MDF prepares an investment financing agreement (IFA) and forwards it to the \nmunicipal government for review. The IFA for the subproject that requires the SAR will be \nprepared  upon  ADB\u2019s  no-objection  to  the  SAR.  MDF  signs  the  IFA  with  the  municipal \ngovernment.  \n \nB.  Preparatory Studies \n \n9.  If requested by the municipal government applying for financing, MDF will finance on a \ngrant basis all preparatory studies (including feasibility, preliminary, final design, and other \nrelated studies) and the costs will be financed up to 80% from the loan proceeds. There will be \nno minimum or maximum cost requirement for any preparatory study. MDF or its clients may \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1997.

Introduction \n \n1.  Due to the project nature, it is not possible to determine in advance the municipalities \nthat will be participating in the Project, nor the investment projects for which these municipalities \nwill ultimately request Municipal Development Fund (MDF) financing. Therefore, a quantitative \neconomic analysis for the Project can not be done at the project appraisal stage.  \n \n2.  This economic analysis framework is prepared in accordance with the guidelines for the \neconomic analysis of projects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),27 to guide the economic \nanalysis to be conducted for each subproject in conjunction with a feasibility study during the \nproject implementation. The framework covers the scope of economic analysis, quantifiable \nbenefits expected from each type of investment, identifiable externalities, and methodologies for \nconducting the economic analysis.  \n \nB.  Rationale for Government Intervention \n \n3.  The rationale for Government intervention results from increasing concern over the poor \ncondition of municipal services. The municipal services in Georgia are trapped in a vicious circle \nof  poor  performance.  The  physical  condition  of  municipal  infrastructure  has  deteriorated \nsignificantly since dissolution of the former Soviet Union due to the lack of capital investments \nand maintenance. Traditional low tariffs or charges for municipal services, aggravated by poor \npayment discipline, has jeopardized the financial condition of utility companies and leaves them \nwith few resources for regular system maintenance. However, with the current very poor quality \nservice levels, people refuse to pay higher tariffs or charges and even resist paying the existing \ncharges. Utilities operate under very difficult circumstances against a background of low salaries \n(often delayed or not paid at all), which makes it difficult to attract new staff and even to retain \nexisting  qualified  staff,  adding  to  the  problems  of  already  weak  managerial,  financial  and \naccounting, and technical capacities in the utilities. These problems, in turn, further impair the \nability of utility companies to provide their services. \n \n4.  To break out of this vicious circle, demonstrable improvements in service provision are \nneeded. There is significant scope to improve municipal services through financial and technical \nsupport to rehabilitate the infrastructure, reform the tariffs and collecting procedure, and develop \nthe capacities of the utilities, and this support can only be provided by the Government at \npresent. It is also incumbent upon the Government to attract further external financial resources \nto complement its own limited resources in order to meet the priority demands of the sector. \n \nC.  Scope of the Economic Analysis \n \n5.  Any subproject with a cost of $2 million or more requires economic analysis which \nshould be conducted in conjunction with its feasibility study. Smaller subprojects costing less \nthan $2 million will be evaluated on the basis of cost effectiveness. \n \nD.  Major Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n6.  The  major  benefits  and  required  cost-benefit  analysis  are  outlined  below  for  each \nspecific category of subproject to be covered by the Project. \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1998. Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n ", "48   Appendix 13   \n \n \n7.  Water Supply. The major benefits that can be considered in the economic analysis \ninclude  (i)  utilities\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  cost  savings,  (ii)  the  willingness  to  pay  or \nreduction in health costs due to a reduction in waterborne diseases (whichever is higher) for \ncurrently connected customers; and (iii) the willingness to pay or avoided water collecting and \nstorage costs or reduction in health costs due to a reduction in waterborne diseases (whichever \nis highest) for costumers to be connected under the Project.  \n \n8.  Solid Waste and Wastewater. The solid waste and wastewater treatment subproject \nwill reduce the pollution of ground and surface water bodies. As a result, public health benefits, \ni.e., the reduction of waterborne diseases, are expected. However, these benefits will accrue to \nthe  public  as  a  whole,  particularly  the  users  of  these  water  bodies,  rather  than  to  direct \nrecipients of services. Practical quantification of the benefits is difficult and costly. Therefore, no \nquantitative cost\u2013benefit analysis is required for this type of subprojects. The subprojects falling \ninto this category will be evaluated on the basis of cost effectiveness. \n \n9.  Urban Road and Public Transport. The major benefits that can be considered in the \neconomic  analysis  include  (i)  utilities\u2019 operation  and  maintenance cost  savings,  (ii)  vehicle \noperating cost savings due to improved road conditions and reduced detours, (iii) decreased \ntravel time due to reduced congestion and detours, and (iv) reductions in pollution and hazards. \n \nE.  Methodologies \n \n10.  The methodologies adopted in subproject economic analysis should be in line with those \nstipulated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (footnote 1), including, \namong other things, (i) demand assessment and projection, (ii) distinguishing incremental and \nnon-incremental demands, (iii) identification and quantification of costs and benefits, and (iv) \nconversion of financial costs to economic costs. Sensitivity analysis should examine the impact \nof cost increase, benefits decrease, and completion delays on a subproject\u2019s economic viability. \nA sensitivity indicator and switching value should be calculated for each of these uncertainties \nand risks. \n \nF.  Criteria \n \n11.  To be eligible for financing under the Project, for a subproject which requires a cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis, the economic internal rate of return should be at least 12%. For a subproject \nwhich does not require a cost\u2013benefit analysis, the subproject should have been justified as the \nleast-cost solution to achieve the subproject objectives, based on cost effectiveness.  \n \nG.  Review Procedure and Institutional Capacity of the Municipal Development Fund  \n \n12.  MDF will review the adequacy of the economic analysis included in the feasibility study \nreport  and  verify  (i)  the  assumptions  and  data  used  in  the  economic  analysis,  (ii)  the \nappropriateness of the methodologies adopted by the analysis, and (iii) the economic eligibility \nof the subproject to be financed by the Project. The results of the review will be presented in a \nboard memo, which will form the basis for the supervisory board to discuss and consider the \nsubproject\u2019s eligibility for MDF financing. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  49 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \nA.  Description of the Financial Intermediary \n1.  The  Municipal  Development  Fund  (MDF)  of  Georgia,  as  the  executing  agency  and \nfinancial intermediary for the Project, is a legal entity of public law whose purpose is to mobilize \nfinancial  resources  from  donors\u2014including  international  and  domestic  financial  institutions, \ndonor  agencies,  and  Government  agencies\u2014for  investments  in  local  infrastructure  and \nservices. MDF was established by a presidential decree for the purpose of managing the \ninvestment component of the World Bank\u2019s First Municipal Development and Decentralization \nProject (MDDP I) and, subsequently, MDDP II and other development agency-funded projects. \n \n2.  In carrying out its activities, MDF acts in accordance with the provisions of the Law on \nLegal Entity of Public Law of 28 May 1999, the provisions of other relevant laws of Georgia, \norders and decrees of the president of Georgia, agreements of the Government of Georgia with \ninternational financial institutions, MDF's charter, and the instructions in its operations manual. \nMDF is financially autonomous.  \n \nB.  Description of the Proposed Project \n3.  The Project comprises two components: an investment projects financing facility, and \nproject management and capacity development. The output of the first component is increased \nquality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid-waste  management,  and \nroads. The outputs of the project management and capacity-development component are (i) \nimproved capacity of municipal governments to prepare and appraise feasibility, engineering \ndesign,  environmental,  social,  and  other  related  studies;  (ii)  improved  capacity  in  project \nmanagement at municipal level; (iii) strengthened corporate and business planning processes \nwithin MDF; and (iv) improved capacity of MDF for studies and training.   \n \nC.   Overview of the Environmental Management System  \n1.  Assessment of Capability of Environmental Management Officers and Staff \n4.  Presently, MDF has one environmental specialist under the management monitoring and \nevaluation  division.  The  specialist  is  responsible  for  providing  technical  assistance  to  the \nborrowing municipalities and supervising environmental assessment for all the investments \nfinanced under the World Bank\u2019s MDDP II and by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). \nThe approval and implementation of the Project is likely to impose substantial additional strain \non the single specialist\u2019s capacity, particularly considering that ADB\u2019s procedures, despite broad \nsimilarities with the World Bank procedures, are new to Georgia and MDF, and the Project is \nlikely to include more environmentally sensitive investments than those financed by the World \nBank and MCC so far.  \n \n2.  Overview of Financial Intermediary\u2019s Environmental Policy \n5.  MDF does not have a separate environmental policy. However, its operation has been \ngoverned by both the environmental laws in Georgia and the World Bank\u2019s environmental \nsafeguards policy for investments financed under MDDP I and II and the safeguards policies of \nother development agencies, including MCC. In particular, the constitution of Georgia states that \n\u201cAny  person  has  the  right  to  live  in  a  healthy  environment,  use  the  natural  and  cultural \nenvironment. Any person is obliged to take care of the natural and cultural environment.\" (Article \n ", "50  Appendix 14   \n \n37, Part 3). Article 37, Part 5 further states that \u201can individual has the right to obtain full, \nunbiased and timely information regarding his working and living environment\". \n \n3.  Description  of  Environmental  Performance  Monitoring  and  Reporting \nSystem \n6.  There  are  three  distinct  stages  of  environmental  assessment  during  a  typical  MDF \nproject cycle: identification, appraisal, and implementation. \n \n7.  Preliminary Environmental Assessment at Identification Stage. The main objective \nof the preliminary environmental screening of projects proposed for MDF financing is to ensure \nthat proposals for projects with potentially adverse effects that cannot be effectively mitigated \nare excluded from financing. During this stage, the following steps will be taken by the MDF. \n \n(i)  Carry out desk environmental assessment using available documents to identify \nproximity of the project impact area to protected areas, resorts, or other restricted \nor extremely sensitive zones. \n(ii)  Collect  evidence  that  the  proposed  project  does  not  violate  environmental \nregulations. \n(iii)  Evaluate evidence of unavoidable and adverse environmental impacts which can \nnot  be  mitigated,  and  explore  possible  design  alternatives  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  If  such  alternatives  and  effective  mitigation  measures  are  not \navailable or are deemed unfeasible at a reasonable cost within the limits set by \nthe local government\u2019s borrowing capacity, declare the project ineligible and/or \ndirect local government to other possible financing sources. \n \n8.  The results of the environmental screening and assessment should be summarized \nusing  statements  such  as  \"no  significant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated\",  \"possible \nadverse environmental impacts can be effectively mitigated\", \"proposed subproject violates \nexisting environmental regulations\", or \"project will lead to positive environmental impacts\". The \nwritten  comments  of  the  evaluation  should  include  a  brief  description  of  the  affected \nenvironment, potential impacts, and recommendations on (i) the involvement of environmental \nconsultants; (ii) the need to consider alternative technical, siting, and other solutions; (iii) the \nneed for specific prevention and mitigation measures; and (iv) the desired level of environmental \nassessment and public involvement at further stages. \n \n9.  Environmental Assessment at Final Appraisal Stage. The tasks of the MDF during \nappraisal include \n \n(i)  visiting the project site and carrying out field assessment, including participating \nin public hearings and consultations; \n(ii)  comparing  results  and  recommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental \nassessment with the final project documentation; ascertaining that necessary \nenvironmental permits (including land use, resources use, debris disposal, and \nsanitary inspection) and approvals are in place or can be obtained; \n(iii)  preparing  the  environmental  assessment  including,  where  needed,  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP); \n(iv)  consulting and disclosing the relevant information on the project\u2019s environmental \nimpacts in a form and manner understandable to those being consulted; \n(v)  examining the project documentation to check that (a) environmental assessment \nwas  performed  in  accordance  with  regulations  and  that  it  followed  the \n ", "  Appendix 14  51 \nrecommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental  assessment,  (b)  the \ndocumentation  includes  all  the  necessary  permits  and  approvals  required  at \nappraisal stage, (c) appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been \nplanned  and  necessary  resources  have  been  allocated,  and  (d)  the  project \ndocumentation and findings of the final site visits have been presented to the \npublic and that the project does not draw public objections; and \n(vi)  making  recommendations  on  the  level  and  mechanisms  of  environmental \nmonitoring during construction and subsequent operations of the project facilities. \n \n10.  Implementation of Environmental Management Plan. During project implementation, \nMDF will monitor the implementation of the EMP, as well as the mitigation of any unexpected \nadverse environmental impacts. In the case of major change in project scope, the MDF will \nensure that the environmental assessment is triggered, and the project proponent undertakes \nthe environmental assessment process.1 MDF will prepare the semi-annual monitoring report \nwhich will describe the EMP implementation and results, compliance with ADB loan covenants \nand applicable government environmental laws and regulations, and the overall performance of \nMDF\u2019s environmental management system and any needed improvements. \n \nD.  Proposed Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Investments \n1.  Overview of Type of Investments to be Assessed \n11.  Investment projects financed by MDF loans and grants from the project resources will be \nlimited exclusively to rehabilitation and repair of existing basic municipal service infrastructure \nand facilities and replacement of equipment for services delivery. The main sector coverage for \nthe proposed project will be water supply and wastewater treatment, urban transport, solid-\nwaste management, and coal gasification and district heating. While the investments in general \nwill potentially bring about significant environmental benefits, some of them may cause adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  during  project  implementation  and  operation.  As  an  example, \nwastewater treatment helps improve water quality, which has a positive impact on human \nhealth, while improper disposal of sludge may cause environmental damage and harm human \nhealth. Similarly, solid-waste disposal projects can have beneficial impacts on human health \nand  living  conditions,  but  poorly  designed  and  implemented  landfill  sites  may  pollute \nunderground water. \n \n2.  Country Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n12.  At  present,  environmental  permit  procedures  are  set  out  in  two  laws\u2014the  laws  of \nEnvironmental  Impact  Permit  (2008)  and  Ecological  Expertise  (2008).  Until  2005,  the  two \nprincipal environmental laws in Georgia were the Law on Environmental Permits and the Law on \nState Ecological Expertise, both of which came into effect in 1997. The Law on Environmental \nPermits  regulated  procedures  for  issuing  permits,  and  covered  environmental  permits, \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs), and public information and participation issues in \ndecision-making procedures. In accordance with the law, all projects were divided into four \ncategories based on their size, importance, and potential impact on the environment. While all \ncategories of projects must undergo Law on State Ecological Expertise (Review) in order to be \nissued a permit, the requirements of the environmental permit process are different for different \ncategories of projects. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section F1/OP: Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Manila. \n ", "52  Appendix 14   \n \n13.  On 24 June 2005, the Law on Licenses and Permits was adopted by Parliament. The \nnew law regulates legally organized activities posing certain threats to human life and health, \nand addresses specific state or public interests, including usage of state resources. It also \nregulates activities requiring licenses or permits, determines types of licenses and permits, and \ndefines the procedures for issuing, revising, and canceling of licenses and permits. A new law \non environmental impact permit has replaced the 1997 Law on Environmental Permits. \n \n14.  A major difference between new and old procedures is that, unlike the old procedures \nwhich classified projects into four categories, the new procedures have been further simplified to \ninclude only two categories, i.e., those activities that require an EIA and those which do not. \nThere are 24 categories of activities\u2014including construction of facilities for recycling of solid \ndomestic wastes (e.g., incineration plants) and/or landfill sites, wastewater treatment facilities \nand sewerage pipes, and water supply facilities\u2014which are subject to the EIA procedures in \norder to be issued an environmental permit, while all the others do not require an EIA. The new \nGovernment procedures are different from ADB requirements which categorize projects into \nthree  categories  (A,  B,  and  C,  see  para.  21).  Furthermore,  in  determining  appropriate \nenvironmental  standards  for  ADB-supported  projects,  ADB  follows  the  standards  and \napproaches  laid  out  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement  Handbook.2 \nHowever, with proper justification, the environmental assessment for any individual project may \nrecommend adoption of alternative emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and \nabatement in order to better reflect national legislation and local conditions (footnote 1). \n \n15.  Under the current procedures, the proponent of a project who seeks an environmental \npermit is expected to conduct an environmental assessment and public consultations within the \ndesired time frame and according to the required procedure. The proponent will involve the \nMinistry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources in the process of conducting the \nenvironmental assessment. Upon completion of the environmental assessment, the proponent \nmay apply to the ministry for an environmental permit. The ministry will carry out state ecological \nexpertise of the Project (for which the EIA has already been conducted) and issue a permit \nwithin 20 days.  \n \n3.  Specific Procedures to be Used for Investments Under the Project \n16.  Responsibilities and Authorities. MDF as the Executing Agency of the Project will \nbear the overall responsibility of ensuring full compliance of the Project with the environmental \nregulations  and  policies  of  Georgia  and  ADB.  This  includes  (i)  conducting  preliminary \nenvironmental assessment including environmental categorization and screening, (ii) ensuring \nthe environmental assessment is conducted in a satisfactory manner during the appraisal stage, \n(iii)  ensuring  all  the  environmental  permits  and  approvals  have  been  obtained,  and  (iv) \nconducting monitoring during project implementation. MDF will be responsible for coordinating \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  (CWRD)  in  applying  and  satisfying  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguard procedures. \n17.  The Ministry of Environment and its regional offices will be responsible for issuing the \nenvironmental permits or consents when all the conditions are met, and may participate in the \nenvironmental monitoring to be conducted by MDF during project implementation. MDF will be \nresponsible for (i) conducting the environmental categorization using ADB\u2019s rapid environmental \nassessment checklist, (ii) conducting the required environmental assessment, (iii) preparing the \nEMP if required, (iv) obtaining all the necessary environmental permits and approvals, and (v) \nmonitoring the implementation of the environmental mitigation measures as specified in the \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 1998. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington DC. \n ", "  Appendix 14  53 \nEMP.  The  main  responsibilities  of  CWRD  will  be  (i)  reviewing  and  clearing  environmental \nassessment reports for category A and category B subprojects deemed sensitive by ADB, and \n(ii) conducting review missions to monitor implementation of the EMP\u2014ADB reserves the right \nto review any subproject proposal and its EIA or IEE. In addition, CWRD will provide technical \nsupport on ADB environmental safeguards policy and procedures.  \n \n18.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection. The Project will primarily focus on \ninvestments with no significant adverse environmental impacts. However, in some exceptional \ncases where the needs for financing environmentally sensitive subprojects (e.g., landfill sites) \nare  well  justified,  such  subprojects  may  be  considered.  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  and  management  procedures  will  be  strictly  followed,  and \nenvironmental risks will be minimized to an acceptable level as a result of properly assessed \nand planned mitigation program. \n \n19.  Environmental Classification. MDF will undertake the environmental categorization \nprocess  of  the  investments  using  ADB\u2019s  rapid  environmental  assessment  checklists.3 The \ncategories are described as follows. \n \n(i)  Category  A. Investments with potential for significant adverse environmental \nimpacts. An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \n(ii)  Category B. Investments judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, \nbut of lesser degree or significance than those for category A projects. An initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  is  required  to  determine  whether  or  not \nsignificant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not \nneeded, the IEE is regarded as the final environmental assessment report. \n(iii)  Category C. Investments unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. No \nEIA or IEE is required, although environmental implications are still reviewed. \n \n20.  Preparation of Initial Environmental Examinations. For category B subprojects, an \nIEE will be prepared as per requirements outlined in the ADB Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines. The IEE should be undertaken as part of the feasibility study, and the environmental \nassessment team should work closely with the technical planning and design group to ensure \nthat environmental considerations are integrated into the project design. The IEE must decide \nwhether or not significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If the EIA is \nwarranted, the IEE must provide a recommendation on scope and terms of reference for the \nEIA. Where no further EIA is recommended, the IEE must include an EMP for each predicted \nimpact, and this will outline identified mitigation measures with (i) cost estimates, (ii) responsible \nparties for implementation, (iii) type of monitoring to be conducted, (iv) frequency and location of \nthe monitoring, and (v) responsible parties for the monitoring. All the strategic alternatives (e.g., \nprincipal water sources for water supply projects and possible routes or sites for wastewater \ntreatment and solid-waste management facilities) should be assessed and decisions should be \ntaken  at  the  feasibility  study  stage.  Further,  the  EIA  should  be  focused  on  the  preferred \nalternative(s). \n \n21.  Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments. For any category A investments \nincluded for project financing, an EIA will be conducted as per requirements outlined in the ADB \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines. The EIA, which will generally have a broader and more \ndetailed scope of work than an IEE, should be undertaken as part of the feasibility and detailed \ndesign, and the environmental assessment team should work closely with the technical planning \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "54  Appendix 14   \n \nand design group to ensure that environmental considerations are integrated into the project \ndesign. The EIA must include an EMP for each predicted impact, and this will outline identified \nmitigation measures with (i) cost estimates, (ii) responsible parties for implementation, (iii) type \nof monitoring to be conducted, (iv) frequency and location of the monitoring, and (v) responsible \nparties for the monitoring. \n \n22.  Requirements for Public Consultation. For category A and B investments, MDF must \nconsult  with  groups  affected  by  the  proposed  investments  and  local  nongovernment \norganizations. The consultation should take place as early as possible in the project cycle so the \nviews  of  the  affected  people  can  be  taken  into  account  in  project  design  and  mitigation \nmeasures included. For category A investments, MDF will ensure that consultation takes place \nat least twice: once during the early stage of EIA fieldwork, and once when the draft EIA report \nis available. \n \n23.  Requirements  for  Information  Disclosure.  Summary  EIA  reports  for  category  A \nsubprojects and summary IEE reports for category B sensitive subprojects are required to be \nposted on MDF and ADB websites. ADB\u2019s 120-day rule (footnote 1) requires that the full EIA for \na category A subproject or the full IEE for a category B sensitive subproject be available to the \ngeneral public at least 120 days before subproject approval.   \n \n24.  Review of Environmental Assessment Reports. MDF will submit an EIA for category \nA subprojects or IEE for category B sensitive subprojects to CWRD for review and clearance, \nand to the Ministry of Environment for review and approval. MDF will submit the IEEs for all \nother category B subprojects to the Ministry of Environment for review and approval. The \nMinistry of Environment will issue the environmental permit. \n \n25.  Monitoring Environmental Performance. MDF, the borrowing municipalities, and in \nsome cases the Ministry of Environment, conduct the environmental monitoring in accordance \nwith the plans and schedules outlined in the EMP. The monitoring results will be included as \npart of the progress report and submitted to ADB on a semi-annual basis. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  55 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Georgia/Municipal Services Development Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department/ \nFinancial Intermediation \nModality:  Division:  Social Sectors Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPoverty reduction and economic development have been one of the top priorities for the Government of Georgia for a number \nof years. The Government has elaborated a draft general strategy for the eradication of extreme poverty. Several reforms \nhave been launched for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and relevant institutions have been \ncreated. As poverty reduction was a key priority for the Government\u2019s reform program, social spending was increased by 5% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) between 2003 and 2005, pension and wage arrears were eliminated, and a targeted poverty \nbenefit was introduced in 2006. The links between the governance and growth reform agendas and their impact on \nemployment and poverty reduction suggest that Georgia\u2019s reform program is on the right track. Poverty is expected to decline \nas the economy\u2019s capacity to generate new jobs develops and a well-targeted and fiscally sustainable social safety net is \nimplemented. Under the Poverty Reduction Support Operation III, the Government expanded the coverage of the targeted \npoverty benefit to about 90,000 extremely poor households and will expand it to 130,000 households under the Poverty \nReduction Support Operation IV.  \n \nInadequate municipal infrastructure\u2014including transport, waster management, sanitation, and drinking water\u2014is a significant \ncontributing factor to the incidence of urban poverty in Georgia, and this contributes to social insecurity. Supporting \nparticipating municipal governments in providing and improving the above public services, could significantly improve the \nliving condition and economic development of municipal populations. The rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage \nservices and improved management of solid waste and concomitant public and environmental health improvements will see \nbenefits spread to the entire municipal population, including the poor and especially women, for whom water supply and \nwaste management are among the most critical needs. Improved transport will enhance public safety and the quality of the \nurban environment and specifically provide opportunities for women to travel for health, education, and employment purposes. \nInvestments in the infrastructure sectors will additionally create employment for poor people. \n \nGeorgia only became an Asian Development Bank (ADB) member country in February 2007; consequently Georgia and ADB \nhave not prepared a country partnership strategy and any sector analysis or sector road map yet. However, ADB has \nprepared the Georgia interim operational strategy (2008\u20132009).a ADB and the Government have identified two projects that \nwill  constitute  the  core  program  for  2008\u20132009:  the municipal  services  development  project,  and  the  regional  roads \ndevelopment project.  \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nPoverty incidence in Georgia rose by an estimated 5.7% during 2004\u20132005 to 32.9%. Although official figures for 2006 have \nyet to be released, a recent World Bank document indicates that poverty has fallen to 31%. Recent strong growth has yet to \ntranslate into sustained trends in declining unemployment and failing poverty rates. The unemployment rate was 13.9% in \n2006. Poor people tend to have larger households and have less access to essential infrastructure and services, including \nelectricity, water supply, and sanitation. In 2004, a new phase of social policy started in Georgia which was characterized by \nthe transition from having a universal social safety system to having a poverty reduction system. On this basis, the \ngovernment established a social assistance and employment agency in 2006 with the main function of implementing a poverty \nreduction program. \n \nThe Government aims to reduce overall poverty incidence by half to 15% and extreme poverty to less than 4% by 2015. It will \ndo this by strengthening the social assistance system, improving access of the poor to affordable basic services, and raising \nnet  job  creation  rates.  Sustained  high  growth  of  more  than  7%  per  year  is  to  be  pursued  through  adherence  to \nmacroeconomic prudence, economic diversification, and infrastructure development. The national objective of reducing \nextreme poverty to below 4% by 2015 is likely to be achieved with the successful reform of a social assistance program that \naims to reach the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the population. The social sectors now account for about a third \nof public spending. However, achieving the MDG for access to safe drinking water is likely to be more challenging as there \nare significant differences in access to infrastructure services between rural and urban areas, and between the poorer and \nmore developed regions of the country. \n \nWith respect to water supply and sanitation, the 2004 study on the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector by the World \n ", "56  Appendix 15   \n \nBank and the Government summarized the following: (i) water, sanitation, and wastewater conditions in most cities and towns \nrange from poor to very poor; (ii) water supply to homes is unstable and in most cases the hours or supply are declining and \nmany households use multiple water sources to meet their daily water demand; (iii) wastewater treatment plans are not \noperational, except partially in Tbilisi; (iv) public health risks are increasing due to discharge of non-treated wastewater and \ninsufficient treatment of piped water; (v) water supply facilities are at least 40 years old and suffer from deferred maintenance \nand repair, except in a few cases in major cities funded mainly through the Municipal Development Fund (MDF); and (vi) \nalmost all WSS utilities have significant debts due to unpaid electricity and taxes.  \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nInadequate urban infrastructure, including transport, is a significant contributing factor to urban poverty in Georgia. The benefit \nin addressing the urban infrastructure of the proposed project for the participating municipal governments will be significant \nimprovements in living conditions (including crucial public health benefits) and significant poverty reduction through improved \nservice provision, and stimulation of economic development by encouraging investment, job creation, and labor mobility. In \naddition, investment will bring faster and more comfortable transport for all sectors of the city population, and reduced traffic \njams and air pollution. Finally, the program will target vulnerable communities such as elderly and poor people.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Finding of Social Analysis \n \nThe main stakeholders in this Project will be the MDF, participating municipal governments, the private sector, utilities \ncompanies, and communities. \n \nBasic municipal infrastructure and services have suffered considerable neglect since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Very \nlittle investment has been available from the central government for rehabilitation of infrastructure or the adequate provision of \nservices. Preexisting mechanisms and systems for maintenance and service provision have collapsed or are no longer \nappropriate. The total dependence on central government (by both local governments and communities) for the provision of \nall infrastructure and maintenance services during the Soviet era remains strongly ingrained and will be a key issue for the \nproject to deal with. \n \nThe  major  challenges  for  the  municipal  governments  are:  (i)  how  to  improve  very  badly  neglected  basic  municipal \ninfrastructure and services in a sustainable way, (ii) how to build the internal capacities necessary to plan and implement \nappropriate infrastructure interventions and develop sustainable service provision, and (iii) how to engage local communities \nto mobilize their own human and financial resources in support of infrastructure projects. The third challenge will require \nchanges in attitude and behaviors with regard to payment for and maintenance of the system after rehabilitation. Civil society \norganizations (CSOs) are likely to be key partners for the municipal governments in achieving changes in behavior through \ncommunity mobilization, awareness raising, and technical training.  \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe civil society sector is quite active in poverty eradication. CSOs\u2019 activities include business development programs, \nemployment creation, health and sanitation education, public awareness, and good governance. The Future Without Poverty \nCivil Alliance (FWPCA) has been established, which currently brings together up to 70 CSOs and individuals. The FWPCA \nattempts to support the implementation in Georgia of the millennium development goal and eradicate poverty through public \nawareness building and activities directed towards increasing Government accountability. Public awareness campaigns to \nbetter educate customers about essential infrastructure services could lead to improved collection rates, protection of \nwatersheds, and conservation of natural assets. As the process of decentralization continues, more administrative and \nservice-delivery responsibilities\u2014including solid-waste management, water supply, road maintenance, and street lighting\u2014\nbecome a function of local government. Involving communities and CSOs is important to (i) ensure that participating municipal \ngovernments are using MDF support on important infrastructure and (ii) improve the prospect for sustainable implementation.  \n \nThe main stakeholders in this project will be MDF, participating municipal governments, private sector/utilities companies, \ncommunities, and CSOs including community-based organizations. MDF and participating municipal governments will ensure \nthat the results of social assessment and stakeholder consultations will be adequately taken into account in determining \ninvestment priorities, making related financial decisions, and implementing investment projects. Participating municipal \ngovernments will consult representatives of all stakeholders in identifying investment priorities and assessing the financial \neffects and affordability of loan financing for improvement of infrastructure and services. The consultation will be carried out in \naccordance with the provision of the laws of Georgia in public, and during the period of social monitoring and project \nimplementation. As part of the preparation of any investments under this project, MDF will (i) ensure that a social assessment \nis carried out in close cooperation with the participating municipal governments; (ii) identify potential social issues associated \n ", "  Appendix 15  57 \nwith investment, carry out adequate public and municipal government participation and consultation, including consultation \nwith CSOs and community-based organizations in the areas; and (iii) ensure that arrangements are made for carrying out \nappropriate levels of participation and consultation during project implementation. The operations manual will include a \nrequirement that social assessments and public and participating municipal government consultations be an integral part of \nthe application for investment financing.   \n  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \n \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues. Georgian legislation declares the equality of men and women in regards to civil and political rights, but in \nreality women are poorly represented in local government agencies and currently make up 8.8% of the members of city \ncouncils. None of the cities or districts of Georgia have a woman in the position of mayor or district governor.   \n  \nThe labor market in Georgia is segmented from the gender point of view. Women are mainly employed in the public sector \nwith the proportion of 117 women per 100 men, whereas the proportion in the non-public sector is 57 women in hired \nemployment per 100 men. Women in the non-public sector are mostly employed in agriculture, education, health care, and \nsmall manufacturing, which have been most negatively affected by economic transition. The privatization process in particular \nhas led to a significant decrease in job opportunities and salaries for women. Most women manage their households\u2014\nincluding water, sanitation, and solid waste\u2014and are the most affected by the inadequate nature of WSS infrastructure. \n \nThe  program  will  directly  and  indirectly  benefit  women  through  promoting  improved  infrastructure,  including  waste \nmanagement, sanitation, potable water, roads, and transport. The primary concerns of women need to be addressed in the \nprogram design and will be part of the consultative process, which should specially target women\u2019s participation in design, \nimplementation, and monitoring of projects. ADB\u2019s investment tackling these service delivery and infrastructure needs is \ncritical to reducing the time spent by women on WSS chores and thus freeing time for engagement in income-generating \nactivities or leisure and family time. The initial discussion with CSOs working on gender issues revealed support for the \nproposed projects since they are perceived as necessary improvements in the urban living environment and critical for \nreducing health hazards like waterborne diseases.      \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \n \nIII.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n  Significant/Limited/  Strategy to Address  Plan or Other Measures \nIssue  No Impact  Issue  Included in Design \n  The Project will finance only projects     \nInvoluntary  entailing the repair or rehabilitation of     Full Plan \nResettlement  existing facilities and infrastructure     Short Plan \nwhich do not require land acquisition or    Resettlement \nresettlement.
