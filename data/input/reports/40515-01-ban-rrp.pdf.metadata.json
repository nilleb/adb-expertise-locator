Better  rural  infrastructure  has  fostered  balanced  development  of  rural \neconomies through mutually reinforcing growth in the farm and non-farm sectors. The mobility of \nthe rural poor has increased, and many are now availing themselves of health, education, and \nnongovernment services, as well as a wide range of economic opportunities. \n\nEmpirical studies confirm that rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh has helped \n4. \nspur  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  Recent  experience  has  shown  that  better  rural \ninfrastructure leads to higher mobility of the rural poor and their farm products. It allows the poor \ngreater access to providers of services, such as health and education, and to off-farm jobs. Rural \ninfrastructure development also helps reduce rural poverty in the following ways: (i) effective road \nconnectivity allows easier movement of labor; (ii) cost-effective transport of produce helps farmers \nrealize  higher  farm  gate  prices;  (iii)  additional  traffic  volume  gives  rise  to  transport-related  small \nbusinesses, such as service stations, repair shops, food stalls, and guesthouses; (iv) construction \nof project facilities and after-construction maintenance directly generate jobs for the poor; and (v) \npoor women have greater access to economic opportunities and new jobs.  \n \n 5. \nA study found that rural road investments in Bangladesh cut poverty significantly through \nincreased  agricultural  production,  higher  wages,  lower  input  and  transportation  costs,  better \neducational  attainment,  and  higher  output  prices.3 Savings  in  household  transport  expenses \naveraged  36%\u201338%.  It  also  increased  output  indexes  by  30%\u201338%,  road  improvements \nincreased  men\u2019s  agricultural  wages  by  27%,  reduced  fertilizer  prices  by  about  5%,  and  raised \naggregate crop price indexes by about 4%. Overall poverty incidence fell by about 1 percentage \npoint, solely because of rural road improvements. A 1994 study showed that, in the catchment \narea  of  improved  facilities,  transport  charges  dropped  by  19%  for  cargo  and  23%  for \npassengers, while the volume traded in those markets doubled.4 Motorized traffic grew by 135% \nand other traffic increased by 85% after the roads were widened and paved.

The  framework  for \ninvestment in rural infrastructure includes (i) developing all-weather upazila (administrative unit- \nsubdivision of a district) roads to provide access to and from growth center markets (GCMs), (ii) \nimproving  union  and  village  roads  to  provide  rural  people  better  access  to  markets  and  social \nservices,  and  (iii)  improving  the  infrastructure  of  GCMs  to  make  trading  more  efficient.  In  the \nNational  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II,  the  government  emphasizes  rural \ninfrastructure development with a focus on road connectivity.6 The goal is to link growth centers, \nunion  parishad  (local  government  institution)  headquarters,  upazila  headquarters,  and  social \nservice institutions such as schools and hospitals with the road networks.  \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  inclusive  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  in  Bangladesh  through  the  strategic  priorities  identified  in  the  country  strategy  and \nprogram,  2006\u20132010.7 ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20208 also  advocates  rural  infrastructure  development. \nRecognizing the importance of rural infrastructure for economic growth and poverty reduction in \nBangladesh,  ADB  and  other  development  partners  including  KfW  have  supported  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to develop rural infrastructure through several projects. Initially focusing on \nbuilding  rural  roads,  bridges,  culverts,  and  the  capacity  of  local  government  institutions,  ADB \nbroadened its support to include the construction of GCMs, flood shelters, and union parishad \noffices. Subsequently gender considerations and community participation in rural infrastructure \nplanning, implementation, and operations and maintenance were included.  \n \n8. \nDespite improvements, rural infrastructure in the country remains underdeveloped. Only \n37%  of the rural  population  has  access to  all-weather  roads, compared with  60%  in  India  and \n61% in Pakistan. In South Asia, 57% of road networks are paved, while only 25% are paved in \nBangladesh. This indicates poor road connectivity, higher vehicle operating costs, and the need \nfor significant upgrading of rural infrastructure. The main problems in fostering road connectivity \nare  (i)  rapidly  growing  demand  for  road  transport  (6%  a  year),  (ii)  lack  of  funds  to  develop \ninfrastructure, (iii)  lack  of  enforcement  of government\u2019s  policies  and  regulations  in road  safety, \n(iv)  inadequate  maintenance  funding  (covering  only  40%  of  the  requirement),  and  (v)  lack  of \ntechnical  skills  and  capacity  building  of  local  government  institutions.  Women\u2019s  access  to \neconomic  opportunities  and  participation  in  decision-making  processes  of  local  governments \nremains limited. Bangladesh is considered one of the countries to be most affected by climate \nchange.  Increased  risk  of  severe  flooding,  more  frequent  extreme  weather  events,  and  a \npotential rise in the sea level pose new challenges to rural infrastructure development.  \n \n9. \nRealizing  the  full  growth  potential  of  rural  areas,  where  75%  of  the  total  population  and \nabout 85% of the poor live, will require substantial improvement in rural infrastructure. Bangladesh \nhas a large unmet demand for rural infrastructure improvement, and needs continuing\u2014or even \nincreasing\u2014investment.  The  rural  road  network  is  284,781  kilometers  (km),  of  which  75% \nremains  unpaved.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  is  planning  to \n\n                                                 \n5   R. Ahmed and M. Hossain. 1990.

Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  2008-2020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fdevelop  about  36,000  km  of  rural  roads  by  2025.  Rural  roads  require  1.77  million  meters  of \nbridges  and  culverts,  of  which  1.10  million  meters  have  been  developed.  By  2025,  240,000 \nmeters of bridges and culverts are planned to be developed. Of the 17,363 GCMs, only 2,895 \nhave been developed  with infrastructure facilities. By 2025, 4,500 GCMs are to be developed. \nLGED\u2019s  20-year  road  master  plan  for  2005\u20132025  envisages  an  investment  of  $26  billion  to \nimprove rural infrastructure.  \n  \n10. \nThe Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project will reduce poverty and raise \nincomes  in  21  districts  of  northwest  and  southwest  Bangladesh  by fostering  economic growth, \ncapacity  development,  and  gender  equity.9 The  project  will  enhance  rural  people\u2019s  access  to \nsocial  services,  such  as  health  and  education,  and  to  economic  opportunities.  Widening  the \naccess  to  markets  and  livelihood  activities  will  increase  earnings  for  the  rural  poor,  including \nwomen. Based on the lessons learned from previous projects, project areas have been selected \non the basis of high connectivity and poverty concentration. Fostering gender equity in economic \nopportunities,  ensuring  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance,  developing  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure, and considering green elements in the design and implementation of the project \nwill be emphasized more.  \n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  reduced  poverty  in  intervention  areas.  The  key \n11. \nperformance  target  will  be  population  in  project  areas  living  in  poverty  falling  by  6  percentage \npoints  from  42.7%  in  2010.  The  project  outcome  will  be  widened  access  to  economic \nopportunities and social services for poor and women.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe project outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) road connectivity \nimproved in a sustainable and climate-proof way; (ii) marketing facilities upgraded with specific \nprovision for women; and (iii) rural infrastructure management, including climate-related issues, \nimproved. \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Road Connectivity Improved \n\n13. \nThe project will upgrade 700 km of upazila roads and 100 km of union roads to bitumen-\nsurfaced standard to provide all-weather, sustainable, and climate-proof road connectivity from \nagricultural production areas and GCMs to other parts of the country. The greening of the roads \nwill  be  mainstreamed  to  meet  aesthetic  recreational  needs,  reducing  the  surface  runoff  and \nchecking  erosion  caused  by  heavy  rainfall  on  the  slope  of  the  embankment;  reducing  the \nencroachment  on  road  reserve  areas;  and  drought-proofing  with  measures  such  as  pasture \ndevelopment,  block  plantation,  and  horticulture  plantation.  The  roads  will  be  climate-proof  in \nresponse to the challenges of climate change. \n\n14.  With the participation of stakeholders, 94 roads have been selected for upgrading based \non  length,  poverty  incidence,  and  degree  of  connectivity.  Cross-drainage  structures,  such  as \nbridges and culverts, with a total length of 3,270 meters will be built. Road safety features will be \nincorporated  into  the  design  of  upazila  roads.  These  may  include  road  signs,  delineators,  and \nbollards  near  the  approach  to  bridges;  reflectors  added  to  tree  trunks;  and  the  provision  of \n\n                                                 \n9   The 21 districts are (i) Kushtia, Chuadanga, Meherpur, Jessore, Jhenidah, Narail, and Magura in Khulna Division; (ii) \nRajshahi,  Natore,  Joypurhat,  Bogra,  Naogaon,  and  Chapai  Nawabgonj  in  Rajshahi  Division;  and  (iii)  Panchagarh, \nThakurgaon, Nilphamari, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, and Lalmonirhat in Rangpur Division. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\floading and unloading zones. Women belonging to labor contracting societies10 will be engaged \nto improve road shoulders, embankment stabilization, planting of trees on roadsides, planting of \nshrubs on embankments, and other road maintenance works.  \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Marketing Facilities Upgraded with Specific Provision for Women \n\n15. \nInfrastructure  of  92  GCMs  will  be  improved  with  sections  for  women  in  50  markets.  A \nparticipatory approach will be used to identify the GCM where market sections for women will be \nbuilt.  Each market  will  be  connected  to  either  an  existing  paved  road  or to  one  of those to  be \nupgraded  under  the  project.  The  markets  will  be  provided  with  paved  trading  areas,  sheds, \nimproved  water  supply  system,  adequate  drainage  facilities,  sanitation  facilities,  and  market \noffices. At each GCM, a market management committee will be responsible for ensuring proper \nphysical  and  financial  maintenance.  In  each  GCM,  6\u201312  shops  will  be  built  solely  for  women \ntraders based on demand shown during participatory discussions.  \n\n16. \nThree GCMs have been selected for piloting the introduction of rural piped water supply \n(one each in the divisions of Khulna, Rajshahi, and Rangpur). The goal is to find a sustainable \nmanagement  model  under  which  the  community  and  local  government  can  operate  and \nmaintain  piped  water  supply  in  rural  markets  where the  availability  of  safe  water  is  a  problem. \nThe  community  will  be  engaged  to  participate  in  planning,  construction,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance of this mini piped water supply system. \n\n17. \nThree GCMs have been selected for piloting the introduction of renewable energy supply \n(one  each  in  the  divisions  of  Khulna,  Rajshahi,  and  Rangpur).  In  the  selected  GCMs,  no \nelectricity  is  available  and  the  Rural  Electrification  Board  has  no  plans  to  provide  electricity \nsoon.  The  shops  (including  the  market  sections  for  women),  toilets,  and  street  lights  will  be \nelectrified using solar-powered photovoltaic cells. The beneficiaries will be trained on judicious \nuse and maintenance of the system, and the responsibility of maintaining the system by paying \nthe maintenance charges.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Rural Infrastructure Management Improved  \n\n18. \nThe project will upgrade the capacity of LGED and other local government institutions to \nmanage  rural  infrastructure.  For  LGED,  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  staff  will  be  improved \nthrough training programs in (i) financial management, (ii) participatory planning, (iii) construction \nsupervision,  (iv)  sustainable  maintenance  and  management,  (v)  planning  and  implementation  of \nclimate-resilient infrastructure (based on a climate vulnerability mapping), (vi) quality control, (vii) \ninformation  technology,  (viii)  gender  and  development,  and  (ix)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The \ntraining  program  for  officials  of  local  government  institutions  will  include  union  parishad \nchairpersons, members, and upazila officials, and members of the management committees of \nGCMs. The program will cover the roles and responsibilities of local governments, sustainable \nroad  maintenance,  financial  management,  poor  and  indigenous  people\u2019s  participation  in  local \ndecision making, and participatory planning. The training program will be supplemented by on-\nthe-job training and awareness campaigns for key target groups on road safety, climate change, \nand environmental issues.  \n \n19. \nIncentive-based  infrastructure.  20  union  parishads  will  have  access  to  funds  for \ninfrastructure  development,  if  they  can  meet  the  performance  standards  related  to  women\u2019s \nparticipation in local governments. For this purpose, $1 million will be set aside to use with pilot \nparticipants  for  additional  infrastructure  investments  if  the  performance  criteria  are  met.  The \n                                                 \n10 These societies comprise poor women with limited income-earning capabilities who carry out routine maintenance \n\non rural roads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by LGED. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\funion parishads in the pilot that meet the agreed performance standards will receive funds of up \nto $45,000 each for infrastructure activities, such as upgrading village roads, building bridges or \nculverts,  upgrading  rural  market  structures,  and  installing  solar  panels  to  provide  lighting  for  a \nrural market. The  union parishads  will  manage the  infrastructure  investment  with  the technical \nsupport from LGED.  \n\n20.    Sustainable  road  maintenance  system.  The  project  will  pilot  sustainable  road \nmaintenance  in  three  roads  with  high  traffic  volumes  (one  in  each  division)  and  prepare  a \nsustainable road maintenance plan. The detailed procedures and implementation guidelines of \nthe  piloting  process  of  collecting  road  user  charges  will  be  prepared,  taking  into  consideration \nthe  stakeholders'  opinions  and  the  necessary  administrative  and  procedural  approval from the \ngovernment. \n  \n21. \nClimate-change-resilient  infrastructure.  The  project  will  mainstream  climate  risk \nreduction  into  policy  formulation  and  infrastructure  development.  A  key  feature  is  climate-\nproofing and disaster-resilient designs for rural infrastructure to ensure that upgraded roads are \nless vulnerable to floods, storm surge, landslides, and impacts of other extreme weather events. \nThe main activities include preparing a climate-change-resilient infrastructure management plan, \nmapping  climate  vulnerability  of  the  rural  areas  (with  a  focus  on  the  project  areas),  and \ndesigning  and  introducing  adaptation  strategies  for  roads  to  improve  flood  and  drought \nmanagement.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $108.4 million (Table 1). \n\n22. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

A  project  steering  committee  will \nprovide  policy  guidance  for  project  implementation.11 The  committee  will  meet  twice  a  year  to \nreview  the  progress  of  project  implementation.  A  suitably  staffed  project  management  office \n(PMO), to be established by LGED at its headquarters in Dhaka, will implement the project. The \nchief  engineer  of  LGED,  assisted  by  the  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit,  will  be \nresponsible for project implementation and coordination. The PMO will have one office in each \nof  the  three  divisions.

The TA will have two components: (i) developing an agreed set of \nelements of women\u2019s participation in the decision making and planning of local governments on \nrural  infrastructure,  and (ii)  piloting  a  performance-based  approach to  women\u2019s  participation  in \nlocal  governments.  The  local  governments  in  the  pilot  that  meet  the  agreed  performance \nstandards, which the TA will develop, will receive funds from the project for rural infrastructure \ndevelopment.  The  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  LGED\u2019s  Gender  Equity  Action  Plan, \n2008\u20132015  by  developing  a  more  standardized  approach  to  ensure  that  women  participate  in \nand benefit from rural infrastructure development. ADB will recruit individual consultants for the \nTA following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analyses  indicate  that  the  project  is  economically  viable.  The  project  will \n29. \ngenerate two types of benefits: (i) the direct benefits, accruing from savings in vehicle operating \ncosts,  reduction  in  travel  time,  enhanced  marketing  facilities,  and  commercialization  of \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fproductive  activities;  and  (ii)  the  indirect  benefits,  stemming from  positive  externalities  that  are \nnot quantified in the economic evaluation, but are likely to be significant. The project will bring \ninstitutional  development  in  the  project  areas,  which  will  promote  the  equitable  distribution  of \neconomic and non-economic benefits. The major components (36 roads and 15 markets) were \nevaluated. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for rural roads varies between \n16%  and  46%.  The  EIRR  for  GCMs  is  estimated  between  16%  and  37%.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis with adverse variation in project costs and project benefits also indicates that evaluated \nroads  and  markets  have  EIRRs  well  above  12%  even  with  increased  costs  and  reduced \nbenefits. \n  \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nLGED\u2019s  financial  management  system  was  assessed  to  ensure  that  its  financial \n30. \nmanagement and procurement capacity is adequate to implement the project. The project has \nestablished  clear  input  and  output  targets  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency.  The  design  and  implementation  arrangements  aim  to  mitigate  corruption  risks. \nRisks  associated  with  project  management,  including  procurement  and  disbursement,  will  be \nmitigated  by  (i)  engaging  international  and  national  consultants  to  advise  and  assist  in  the \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services;  (ii)  requiring  that  civil  work  contracts  include  a  condition \nthat contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, amended, from time to time); (iii) \nthe  PMO  periodically  inspecting  the  contractor\u2019s  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (iv) \nreporting  on  project  activities  and  implementation  on  the  LGED  website to foster transparency \nand timely awarding of contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy  was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and LGED. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\nThe  project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  6  percentage  points from  42.7% in  2010  in  the \n31. \nintervention areas. Under the project, 4.2 million people will gain all-weather access to markets \nand  social  services.  In  addition,  an  estimated  28,500  person-years  of  unskilled  jobs  will  be \ncreated during construction (30% of which  will be for women); and 3,600 person-years of jobs \nfor poor women will be created in road maintenance, and roadside tree planting and care. Farm \nincome will rise 49%\u2014due to 15%  higher crop yields and a 45% increase in the availability of \nagricultural  inputs\u2014which  will  reduce  poverty  in  project  areas.  Improved  capacity  of  the  local \ngovernments in running their affairs in a participatory manner will benefit and empower the poor, \nespecially women.  \n  \nGender and development. Implementation of a gender action plan will help ensure that \n32. \nwomen  participate \nin \ninfrastructure planning and implementation will enable them to voice their needs and participate \nin decision making. New jobs will be created for women in construction and maintenance, and \nelements of the core labor standards will be enforced to benefit them. Constructing sections for \nwomen in 50 markets with about 500 shops will create business opportunities and jobs for poor \nwomen. Skills development and other training of beneficiaries and union parishad members will \nhelp  in raising the  return  on  women\u2019s  labor,  enabling them  to  influence decision  making.  Over \nthe long-run, activities addressing women\u2019s empowerment will help to narrow the gender gap in \nthe project areas. \n  \n\ninfrastructure.  Women\u2019s \n\nin  and  benefit \n\ninvolvement \n\nfrom  rural \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nEnvironment. The project is category B for environment. An environmental assessment \nand review framework and an initial environmental examination for core subprojects have been \nprepared. Since the project will improve the existing rural road network and new roads are not \nplanned,  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  are  not  expected.  The  potential  problematic \nenvironmental issues during construction include (i) soil erosion, silt runoff, and gully erosion; (ii) \ndrainage  blockage  and/or  congestion,  waterlogging,  and  localized  flooding;  (iii)  surface  water \nand  groundwater  contamination;  (iv)  air  (dust)  and  noise  pollution;  (v)  contamination  from \nstorage and transportation of construction materials; and (vi) hygiene, sanitation, and safety of \nconstruction workers. These effects were considered during project design and measures were \nincluded  to  minimize  possible  harm,  as  shown  in  the  environmental  management  plan,  which \nwill be a part of the construction contracts.  \n \n34. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  However,  since \nthe  scope  includes  only  upgrading  and  sealing  of  upazila  and  union  roads  on  their  existing \nalignments, as well as upgrading GCM facilities, the project will not involve relocation and very \nlittle,  if  any,  land  acquisition.  Because  the  roads  are  in  rural  areas,  there  has  not  been  any \nencroachment  onto  the  right-of-way.  If  small  strips  of  land  are  required  to  facilitate  shape \ncorrections,  a  settlement  will  be  negotiated.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for \nthe  project,  which  outlines  the  due  diligence  methodology  for  transparent  implementation  of  a \nnegotiated  settlement,  and \nfor  preparation  of  a  resettlement  plan  and \nimplementation responsibility. \n \nIndigenous  people.    The  project  is  category  B  for  indigenous  people.  Indigenous \n35. \npeople make up less than 2% of the population of the project districts, and their livelihoods are \nsimilar  to  those  of  the  majority  population.  However,  indigenous  people  are  generally  poorer \nthan  the  majority  with  less  access  to  land  and  resources,  and  lower  educational  attainment. \nOther  social  differences,  such  as  religion  and  gender  relations,  also  necessitate  separate \nconsideration of participation methods. Overall, the impacts from better road and market access \nwill  be  positive.  An  indigenous  peoples  framework  has  been  developed  that  summarizes  the \nresults  of  consultations  with  the  indigenous  people  and  lays  out  initial  strategies  for  ensuring \nthat they participate in and benefit from the project. The project provides for the development of \nindigenous peoples plans for upazilas where their communities are prevalent.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ntriggers \n\nthe \n\n36. \nThe  project  involves  some  risks,  which  are  manageable  and  will  be  largely  mitigated \nduring  implementation.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays \n\nConsequences of climate \nchange  \n\nMitigating Measures \nPotential  delays  in  project  start-up  will  be  reduced  by  taking  advance  action  on \ncontracting  of  civil  works  and  consulting  services.  Some  contractors\u2019  limited \nexperience  in  implementing  foreign-aided  projects  will  be  remedied  by  their \nparticipation in training programs under the project.  \nThe  project  will  mainstream  climate  risk  reduction  into  policy  formulation  and \ninfrastructure  development.  Key  features  are  climate-proofing  and  disaster-\nresilient  designs  for  rural  infrastructure,  and  preparation  of  a  climate-change-\n\n                                                 \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fresilient  infrastructure management  plan,  and a climate  vulnerability mapping of \nproject areas.   \n\nLack of maintenance funds   The government agreed to reduce the gap between annual budgetary allocation \nand needs for operation and maintenance. The project will also pilot sustainable \nroad  maintenance  in  three  high-traffic-volume  roads,  and  prepare  a  sustainable \nroad maintenance plan \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nThe government and LGED have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n37. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
