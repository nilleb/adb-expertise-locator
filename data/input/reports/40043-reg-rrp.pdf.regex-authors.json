Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been \nAssessment  undertaken and summary IEEs are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n   \nProject Description  The  proposed  Project  will  interconnect  the  power  grids  in \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s scope will cover the construction of a 220 kilovolt \n(kV) double-circuit transmission line that will link the hydropower \nstations located on the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan to the border \ntown  of  Sherkan  Bandar;  then  to  Kunduz,  Baglan,  and  Pul-e-\nKhumri  in  Afghanistan.  This  line  will  be  ultimately  linked  to \nAfghanistan\u2019s major electricity demand centre, Kabul, through the \nAfghan 220 kV corridor currently under construction, linking Pul-e-\nKhumri to Kabul. \n \nThe Project will also include upgrading and new investments in \nTajikistan  that  will  help  reduce  the  winter  power  deficit  by  (i) \nincreasing the available level of generation, and (ii) decreasing the \nlevel of technical losses in south Tajikistan. Both measures will \naim to export 300 megawatt (MW) to Afghanistan and generate \nadditional 320 gigawatt-hour (GWh) annually in Tajikistan. \n \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  governments\u2019  strategies  and \npolicies. In Afghanistan, the policy is to provide reliable power \nsupply to all Afghans. In Tajikistan, the policy is to maximize the \nuse of its hydropower assets. \n \nThe  project  scope  has  been  coordinated  with  other  external \nfunding agencies. \n   \nRationale  Afghanistan\u2019s  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems have been severely damaged by years of conflict. There \nis almost no transmission grid and generation is very limited. Lack \nof generation capacity has led to widespread use of load shedding \nthroughout the country, including the capital Kabul where supply is \navailable only a few hours a day. To cope with this situation, \nwhere the grid is unable to provide reliable supply, most of the \nenergy users and industry have shifted to decentralized small-\nscale diesel power generation. Consequently, Kabul has become ", "ii   \na highly polluted city and the average generation cost has gone \nup to more than $0.33 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), taking into account \nhigh international market prices for crude oil.  \n \nRegionally, there are large surpluses of generation in Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan while Afghanistan is struggling with \na large power deficit. All economic and technical studies show that \nimporting  power  from  neighboring  countries\u2014even  during  a \nlimited period of the year\u2014has a sound rate of return. Recent \nstudies  recommend  that  interconnections  with  neighboring \ncountries should be pursued and encouraged in parallel with the \ndevelopment  of  domestic  generation.  Reconstruction  of  power \nlines between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan is ongoing under Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing. A few small interconnections \nbetween Iran, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan are in operation but \nnone of them are able to meet the demand in Kabul city. \n \nTajikistan has an installed generation capacity of 4,405 MW (98% \nhydropower) and current surplus generation of 1,500 GWh per \nyear. At a nominal value of $0.02/kWh this surplus is potentially \nworth $30 million per year.The surplus is only available for export \nfor 6\u20138 months during the spring-summer period and 90% of the \ninstalled  generation  capacity  in  Tajikistan  is  located  in  the \nsouthern  part  of  the  country.  Tajikistan  has  three  separate \ntransmission grids that are not interconnected (north, south, and \neast grids). The only way for Tajikistan to export its surplus at \npresent  is  to  use  the  Uzbek  grid.  However,  transmission \nconstraints in Uzbekistan mean that Tajikistan is not able to use \nthe Uzbek grid most of the time. Therefore, water is spilled without \ngenerating electricity during the summer and potential electricity \nsupply is wasted. \n \nBased on the above, the Project offers a win-win situation where \nAfghanistan\u2019s lack of power supply can be met by Tajikistan\u2019s \nsurplus, which it is currently unable to export.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be enhanced cooperation in the \n  power  sector  through  transmission  interconnectivity  between  \nTajikistan and Afghanistan. The outcome of the Project will be \n(i) increased  power  export  and  income  generation  capacity  of  \nTajikistan by increasing the capacity of its south grid hydropower \ngeneration,  (ii)  restored  power  supply  and  reduced  cost  for \nconsumers  in  Afghanistan,  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  the  utility \noperation  of  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority  (DABM),  and \n(iv) improved commercial operation of Barki Tajik (BT).  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $109.5 million. \nThe Afghan component is estimated at $55.5 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.3 million equivalent.

The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of this component is 31.0%. \n \nIn Tajikistan, the economy and BT will benefit from power exports. \nRevenues from the Project are expected to be used to reduce the \nactual winter deficit by developing new generating assets. In the \nshort term, they will help to settle the power bill from Uzbekistan \nfor winter imports. This will benefit Tajikistan power consumers. \nThe EIRR of this component is 31.1%. \n \nThe total net economic benefits of regional cooperation of the \nProject are estimated to be $114.1 million\u201447% to Afghanistan \nand  53%  to  Tajikistan.  The  Project  is  a  win-win  example  of \nregional cooperation. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential technical \nand economic risks.  \n \nThe main risks and assumptions identified are the following: \n \n(i)  The overall political and security situation in Afghanistan \nmay delay the Project, and sabotage may affect the future \navailability  of  the  transmission  line.  This  has  been \naddressed by allocating $700,000 for security purposes \nduring  construction  as  counterpart  financing  and \n$1.0 million for demining. During the operation stage, the \nrisk of blasting the transmission line has been mitigated by \n ", "vi   \nthe fact that the line will supply electricity to local villagers \nfrom  the  border  to  Pul-e-Khumri,  who  will  act  as \nguarantors for the security of the line. \n(ii)  Default on payment from the Afghan side for the purchase \nof power import. The intergovernmental agreement signed \nbetween the parties anticipates that bank guarantees will \nbe defined and set up under the provisions of the power \npurchase agreement (PPA) to secure the obligations of \neach party.  \n(iii)  The demands in Baglan, Kabul, Kunduz, and Pul-e-Khumri \nregions are not as high as expected. The PPA will include \na minimum off-take volume from Afghanistan that will be \ntreated as a \u201ctake or pay\u201d condition. \n(iv)  Weak implementation capacity in Afghanistan could lead \nto  delays  in  implementation.  In  addition  to  the \nimplementation  consultants  funded  under  the  Project, \nprovision has been made to provide support to MEW for \nproject administration during the whole project period. \n(v)  Lack  of  competition  and  high  bidding  prices.  The \nprocurement plan provides for the issuance of a single \ntender with two separate components\u2014one in Afghanistan \nand  the  other  in  Tajikistan\u2014for  the  entire  line.  This \narrangement is expected to attract more competition and \nlower bidding prices.  \n(vi)  Weak  performance  of  DABM  during  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  Project.  TA  has  been  proposed  to \nmitigate the risk of improper maintenance and operation.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Two advisory TA grants are attached to the loan: (i) $1.2 million \nfor Afghanistan, and (ii) $1.5 million for Tajikistan.  \n \nThe TA in Afghanistan will strengthen the capability of DABM in \nfinancial,  managerial,  commercial,  and  technical  fields.  It  will \nfinance human resource development and domestic and overseas \ntraining of DABM staff. It will be financed as a grant from ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. International consultants will be required for \n20 person-months and national consultants for 45 person-months. \nThey  will  be  recruited  as  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time) using quality and cost-based selection. The TA \nin Tajikistan will help to improve the overall managerial capacity \nand  technical  and  financial  efficiency  of  BT  by  providing \ninstitutional  and  corporate  governance  support  through  the \ndevelopment of a management contract or other form of contract \nas appropriate. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, for \n$1,500,000.  International  consultants  will  be  required  for \n40 person-months  and  national  consultants  for  110 person-\nmonths. They will be recruited as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time) using quality and cost-based selection.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) the proposed \nloans to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Regional \nPower  Transmission  Interconnection  Project;  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be \nprovided  by  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OFID) for the Tajikistan component of the Project as joint financing; \n(iii) proposed technical assistance (TA) for improving the capacity of Da Afghanistan Breshna \nMoassessa (DABM), and (iv) proposed TA for strengthening corporate management of Barki \nTajik (BT). \n \n2.  The  Project  was  identified  and  prepared  under  the  TA  program  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The Government of Tajikistan is actively pursuing opportunities to \nsell its excess power in spring and summer, while the Government of Afghanistan has identified \npower imports as the most effective way of meeting its short-term power shortfall. The Project \nwas included in the regional project pipeline and endorsed by the energy and finance ministers \nand key power sector state-owned enterprises of both countries\u2014BT and DABM\u2014through the \nmemoranda of understanding (MOU) signed with ADB on 24 September 2006 by Tajikistan and \non 30 October 2006 by Afghanistan. The Fact-Finding Mission for the Project was undertaken \nfrom 28 August 2006 to 24 September 2006. The Project was formulated based on the findings \nof  the  TA1 consultants and  the  ADB  Mission.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  In Afghanistan, the total generation capacity has declined from about 456 megawatt \n(MW) in the 1990s to about 250 MW in 2005. Only 6\u20139% of the population has access to power, \nof which approximately 30% is in Kabul. The other provinces have even less access, with rural \nareas being virtually unserved. Of 475 MW of original installed generation capacity (261 MW \nhydropower, 151 MW thermal, and 63 MW diesel generation), much was destroyed or damaged \nduring the war years and a significant portion of transmission and distribution networks were \ndamaged, pillaged, or stolen.  \n \n4.  The power sector master plan, finalized in October 2004, identified power import as the \nfastest way to reinstate electricity supply to Afghanistan in the short term. A 220 kilovolt (kV) \ndouble-circuit transmission line to facilitate import from Uzbekistan is now under construction \nwith financing from ADB (from Hairatan/Mazar-e-Sharif to Pul-e-Khumri), Government of India \n(from Pul-e-Khumri to Chimtalah), World Bank (from Chimtalah to Kabul), United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID)  (for  demining  and  security),  and  Germany  (for  the \nconstruction of a 220 kV substations at Mazar-e-Sharif and Pul-e-Khumri). \n \n5.  Tajikistan has a surplus of power generation capacity in the summer months that could \nmeet  part  of  the  power  shortfall  in  Afghanistan.  BT  is  the  state-owned  power  company \nresponsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of the power sector; and has \ninstalled  generation  capacity  of  4,326  MW.  Its  operational  assets  also  include  about \n4,300 circuit-kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines.  Because  of  its  generation  mix  (98% \nhydropower), Tajikistan\u2019s power system is directly linked to hydrologic conditions and seasons. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic  of Afghanistan for Preparing the National Power \nTransmission Grid Project. Manila. ", "2 \nTherefore, in summer, Tajikistan has excess energy available for export. Part of this surplus is \nexported through Uzbekistan via its southern grid; the rest is not utilized and Tajikistan is forced \nto spill water without generating electricity because of lack of access to other power markets.  \n \n6.  The Government of Tajikistan is actively pursuing new interconnection projects with its \nneighbors (Afghanistan and Pakistan) that will allow it to sell its excess power. On 9 December \n2005, the minister of Energy of Tajikistan and the minister of Energy and Water of Afghanistan \nsigned an MOU in Dushanbe that recorded the interest and readiness of Tajikistan to supply \n300 MW during spring and summer to Afghanistan, and as much as Tajikistan can provide \nduring the autumn and winter. On 21 February 2006, the two ministers entered into an MOU \nwith the purpose of establishing a framework for enhancing bilateral power exchange and trade \nbetween the two countries.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Institutional Framework in the Power Sector \n \n7.  In December 2004, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) was created in Afghanistan \nby restructuring and merging the responsibilities of the Ministry of Water and Power and some \nresponsibilities of the Ministry of Mines and Industry. MEW is responsible for power, gas, \npetroleum, and water resources. In the power sector, MEW owns and controls five state-owned \nenterprises responsible for (i) operations, (ii) civil works, (iii) construction, (iv) design consulting, \nand (v) research and development. The enterprises employ over 6,500 people. DABM is the unit \nresponsible for operations of the power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. It is \nby  far  the  largest  of  these  enterprises,  with  over  5,400  employees.  DABM  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency (IA) for Afghan component of the Project. DABM has very limited capacity \nin terms of all aspects of power utility management and will receive support under the Project.  \n \n8.  In Tajikistan, at the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the \nOffice of the President has overall responsibility for the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy \n(MOE), established in October 2000, is responsible for implementation of the energy policy of \nthe Government of Tajikistan. The Agency on Anti-Monopoly Policy and Entrepreneurship acts \naccording to the provisions of the Law on Natural Monopolies; and regulates the tariffs on \nelectricity, gas, and district heat. It reports directly to the Office of the President. \n \n9.  At the operating level, the power sector in Tajikistan is the responsibility of the joint stock \ncompany  BT,2 a  vertically  integrated  company  in  charge  of  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of electricity and heat for the whole country\u2014except in the Gorno Badakshan region \nwhere a 25-year concession was given to a private company, Pamir Energy, in 2002. Under the \npresent institutional arrangement, BT consists of a network of 10 subsidiary power generation \ncompanies,  11  subsidiary  distribution  companies,  and  8  supporting companies  (such  as  a \nresearch institute and a construction company). BT reports to MOE. BT serves a customer base \nof 969,000 and employs over 9,700 staff. Its biggest customer is Tursundaze Aluminum Smelter \n(TADAZ), which accounts for approximately 40% of the electricity sales in the country. BT will \nbe the Executing Agency (EA) for the Tajik component of the Project. While considerable efforts \nhave been made to improve the commercial operation of BT, support will be provided under the \nProject. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   BT became a joint stock company by Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.  \n ", "3 \n2.  Energy Balance \n \n10.  Afghanistan is facing a serious power supply shortage which is expected to become \nmore acute as demand grows. No new generation capacity is expected in the next few years. \nAreas to be supplied by the Project include the following: \n \n(i)  The capital Kabul, with a rapidly growing population of 4\u20135 million people, has no \ncontinuous power supply. The total effective generation capacity is 120 MW but \ntotal demand is estimated at 300\u2013350 MW, with significant demand unserved \nthrough the grid system because of inadequate supply. A significant proportion of \nthe supply is met through privately operated small diesel-fired units and through \nthe  DABM-operated  North  West  Kabul  diesel-fired  plant,  for  which  USAID \nfinanced the purchase of fuel until 2006.  \n(ii)  The  Kunduz  Baglan  and  Pul-e-Khumri  regions  between  the  Tajikistan/ \nAfghanistan border and Kabul, which have a present load of 15 MW and an \nunserved demand estimated by DABM to be in excess of 80 MW. \n(iii)  The northern part of the country, which has demand of about 130 MW, including \nan estimated suppressed demand of about 80 MW.   \n \n11.  Total demand is forecast to grow at 5.5% per annum to about 1,100 MW by 2020. To \nmeet the growing demand, and with lack of domestic generation capacity, the 2004 power \nsector master plan identified the import of energy from neighboring countries as one of the \nshort-term options to increase power supply in Kabul. The Government plans to import up to \n150 MW each from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan via Khulm and Pul-e-Khumri to meet winter \ndemand, and up to 300 MW from Tajikistan via Kunduz and Pul-e-Khumri to meet summer \ndemand. \n \n12.  In Tajikistan, the installed power generation capacity is 4,405 MW, mainly comprising six \nhydropower plants (HPPs) totaling 4,060 MW and two fossil fuel-fired combined heat and power \nstations totaling 345 MW. Annual hydropower energy output is about 16,000 gigawatt-hour \n(GWh) and electricity is delivered to nearly 100% of the population of almost 7 million. Nurek is \nby far the largest HPP and has been in operation since the mid-1970s with an installed capacity \nof 3,000 MW. It provides considerable regulation of the Vakhsh River and gives stability to the \npower  system  in  Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan.  On  average, \nTajikistan currently has a summer surplus of 1,500 GWh available for export. This surplus will \nbe  increased  by  2,700  GWh  when  Sangtuda-I  HPP,  currently  under  construction,  will  be \ncommissioned in April 2009. \n \n13.  Tajikistan has three separate power systems (grids): (i) the southern system, (ii) the \nnorthern system (these two are interconnected but only via the Uzbekistan grid), and (iii) the \nsmall eastern (Pamir) system. The southern system is by far the largest, with installed capacity \nof 3,895 MW on the Vakhsh River and a further 15 MW elsewhere. The Khatlon region is served \nby the southern grid. \n \n14.  Both  the  southern  system,  which  includes  the  capital  Dushanbe,  and  the  northern \nsystem have a generation deficit in winter and rely on imported energy from Uzbekistan. This is \nbecause of lack of snowmelt and consequent low river flow in autumn and winter. The strategy \nof the Government of Tajikistan is to increase the amount of electricity available during the \nwinter by (i) developing new generating plants on the Vakhsh River; (ii) rehabilitating and \nupgrading  the  existing  schemes;  and  (iii)  reducing  technical,  transmission,  and  distribution \nlosses while seeking new power markets for exporting its surplus energy in summer. \n \n ", "4 \n     3.  Pricing/Tariff Issues \n \na.  Afghanistan \n \n15.  DABM recently doubled tariffs from an average of $0.0416 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to \n$0.0830/kWh. The tariff increases took effect on 23 September 2006. This significant increase \nin tariffs was based on advice from USAID that it will no longer fund the purchase of diesel to \nrun the North West Kabul diesel generator. USAID was subsidizing the cost of diesel in the \namount of $50 million per year for the last 2\u20133 years. The higher tariffs will help to defray the \ncost of diesel purchases that DABM will incur during the next 2\u20133 winter seasons until electricity \nimports from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan replace the expensive diesel generation. \n \n16.  Assuming that sufficient imported electricity is available from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan \nto fully replace diesel generation, the new tariff significantly improves the financial sustainability \nof DABM. The average supply cost of DABM is estimated to be $0.080/kWh compared with the \nnew  tariff  of  $0.083/kWh  As  Uzbekistan\u2019s  supply  is  limited  to  only  150  MW,  some  diesel \ngenerated power will be still be needed during winter and the average annual supply cost is \nlikely to be higher than $0.083/kWh. Therefore, DABM will need to increase real tariffs further to \nreach cost recovery level in the event that only limited import supplies are available over the \nlong term. This will be important for Afghanistan\u2019s ability to pay for power imports and the \nsustainability of the Project.  \n \nb.  Tajikistan \n \n17.  The Government of Tajikistan has confirmed to ADB that it is developing an electricity \ntariff increase strategy in line with the commitment  made to ADB and the World Bank in \nJanuary 2006.3 In September 2006, BT submitted a proposal to increase tariffs to reach an \naverage tariff of $0.021/kWh (in 2003 terms) by 2010. This is a significant increase from the \ncurrent  average  tariffs  of  $0.006/kWh.  The  new  tariff  is  expected  to  be  endorsed  by  the \nPresident and ratified by parliament in late November.  \n \n18.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) recognizes that rising tariffs mean that the social safety \nnet needs to be strengthened to mitigate their effect on the poorest consumers. The present \nsize of the social welfare tariff block is 250 kWh/month, which is relatively high. The current \nsocial  safety  net  includes  the  Energy  Compensation  Mechanism,  which  provides  a  100% \nsubsidy for poor consumers that earn less than TJS20/capita/month. It is envisaged that rising \ntariffs  will  raise  the  tax  revenues  from  BT\u2019s  profits  and  additional  dividend  income  to  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan to levels sufficient to fund the safety net. MOF has committed to \nrelend the concessionary loans from ADB and co-financiers\u2019 at the OCR rate of the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)  and use the difference in the interest to partly fund the social \nsafety net together with additional budget provisions. Rationalization and tariff increases will be \ncrucial for the long-term sustainability of the power sector in Tajikistan, together with maximizing \nexport revenues. \n \n  4.  Governments\u2019 Strategy and Plans \n \na.  Afghanistan \n \n19.  In February 2004, the Government of Afghanistan formulated an electricity sector policy \nand power sector road map (Appendix 2). The main elements will enable the establishment of a \n                                                 \n3 MOU on Energy Sector Development Strategy signed in Dushanbe in January 2006. \n ", "5 \nregulatory framework; and restructuring, unbundling, and commercialization of the sector. The \npolicy  plans  to  supply  the  entire  country  with  reliable  power  and  create  730,000  more \nconnections by 2010. The Government of Afghanistan aims to make more power available in \nthe  main  regions  by  (i)  investing  in  system  rehabilitation;  (ii)  increasing  supply,  partly  by \nimporting  more  power;  and  (iii)  expanding  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ninfrastructure.  \n \n20.  The reform plan of the Government of Afghanistan is to corporatize and eventually \nunbundle DABM, appoint a new board of directors, and form four regional vertically integrated \nbusiness units. MEW will be responsible for sector policy and planning, and will continue to \nprepare and implement sector policies, coordinate external assistance programs, and improve \ngovernance of the sector.   \n \nb.  Tajikistan \n \n21.  In  2005,  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  developed  a  strategy  based  on  a  two-track \napproach for the domestic and export markets. The first track focuses on the domestic market, \nand comprises a set of policy and investment measures aimed to bring the sector to reasonable \noperating  conditions  and  improve  its  financial  viability.  This  policy  includes  (i)  the \nimplementation of a medium-term tariff policy; (ii) a social protection policy for energy services \nto improve the effectiveness of the scheme and ensure a more targeted approach to support the \npoor; and (iii) an institutional reform policy for the energy sector to improve the transparency \nand  efficiency  of  operations,  enable  electricity  trade,  and  pave  the  way  for  private  sector \nparticipation in the sector. The second track focuses on increasing electricity exports\u2014first \nusing  existing  seasonal  surpluses  in  the  summer,  then  by  developing  newer  hydroelectric \ncapacities for export to countries in the region (including Afghanistan, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia). Some seasonal exports to Afghanistan and Russia via \nUzbekistan are already occurring, and the Government of Tajikistan is developing additional \nhydropower capacities with foreign investors, e.g., from Russia and Iran. \n \n5.  Lessons  \n22.  The key lessons learned from ADB operations in Central Asia in terms of regional \ncooperation  are  that  Central  Asian  countries  are  still  in  a  transition  stage.  Commercial \narrangements between governments are quite often dictated more by political than economic \nconsiderations. For example, Tajikistan could not maximize the use of its excess generation \nthrough export sales during the summer season because of the unwillingness of Uzbekistan to \nimport Tajik power surplus, and transmission constraints in Uzbekistan. Therefore, excess water \nis spilled without generating electricity. The Regional Transmission Modernization Project4 in \nTajikistan and Uzbekistan aimed to develop power trade relations between the two countries by \nmaximizing the use of hydropower generation but it could not be implemented because the \ncountries were unable to agree on the terms of a power trade framework agreement. Given this \nexperience, agreement on power trade should be achieved during the project design stage. \nThese lessons are included in the project design. The intergovernmental agreement on power \ntrade  was  a  condition  for  loan  negotiations.  The  agreement  was  signed  and  is  dated  17 \nNovember 2006. A power purchase agreement (PPA) is currently in force for the existing 8 MW \ninterconnection between the two countries until 2009 and a new PPA will be agreed between \nthe two power utilities as stipulated in the intergovernmental agreement. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Tajikistan and \nUzbekistan for the Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project. Manila. \n ", "6 \n23.  Another important lesson is implementation delay in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Delays \nhave occurred in both countries mainly because of lack of familiarity with ADB guidelines and \nprocedures. The Project will be the third ADB project in both countries and such delays should \nno longer be encountered. However, in Afghanistan, MEW still lacks sufficient skills so the \nproject design includes provision to strengthen the existing project implementation unit (PIU) \nand to assist MEW in implementing and administering the Project in a timely manner. \n \n24.  Competition in Afghanistan is weak because of security reasons, and bid prices are \nhigher than the engineer\u2019s estimates. To improve competition, the project design involves a \nsingle bid for both the Afghan and Tajik parts of the transmission line. This is expected to attract \nadditional bidders as about 75% of the works have to be carried out in Tajikistan where there \nare no security issues. \n \n25.  Previous loan covenants were too ambitious and could not be met within the agreed time \nframe. Treatment of the arrears of the aluminum smelter TADAZ with BT reached agreement \nbut the target for accounts receivable of 3 months was not met. In addition, the commitment to \nincrease tariffs was not met as the tariff targets were too high. With hindsight, the time given to \nreach the targets may have been too tight and the targets too ambitious. While it is useful to set \nchallenging targets, they must be realistic and achievable, and the EA management must be \ncommitted to achieve them. The pace of sector reform has been slow. The unbundling of BT \nand tariff increases are behind schedule and need to be reconsidered. To address these issues, \na TA is included which will help to improve the corporate governance of BT and facilitate sector \nreforms and financial viability.  \n \n26.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s regional cooperation program, which links and complements the \nindividual country programs, has focused on identifying infrastructure needs and providing the \ninvestment environment for promoting cross-border trade in the areas of energy, trade, and \ntransportation. In the energy sector, ADB\u2019s focus is on (i) maximizing the utilization of national \nresources and assets; (ii) benefiting neighboring countries by rationalizing and encouraging \nregional energy trade, based on market principles and (iii) rehabilitating existing infrastructure. \nThe Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s regional and country-specific strategies. \n \n6.  External Assistance \n \n27.  Afghanistan. The power sector in Afghanistan has received substantial support from \nseveral aid agencies including (i) ADB: transmission; (ii) World Bank: distribution, generation in \nKabul  and  other  key  cities,  capacity  building  for  management  improvement  and \ncommercialization of DABM; (iii) German development cooperation through KfW banking group \n(KfW): rehabilitation of power distribution networks and hydropower plants serving the Kabul \narea; and (iv) USAID: institutional strengthening and restructuring of MEW, rehabilitation of \npower generation plants, and purchase of essential fuel supplies. The governments of India and \nIran have also provided assistance to finance key power transmission links (summarized in \nAppendix 3 and detailed in Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n28.  Tajikistan. The power sector in Tajikistan has received support totaling $123 million \nfrom several aid agencies including (i) World Bank: cofinancing the Pamir Private Power Project \nand  a loss  reduction project;  (ii) Islamic  Development  Bank  (IsDB):  Dushanbe  substations \nrehabilitation, construction of small hydropower plants, and transmission line feasibility study; \n(iii) Kuwait Fund for Arabic and Economic Development (KFAED): Dushanbe distribution system \nrehabilitation; (iv) Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) cofinancing of several \n ", "7 \npower projects; and (v) ADB: Power Rehabilitation Project.5 The Aga Khan Foundation has \ninvested equity in the Pamir Private Power Project (summarized in Appendix 3 and detailed in \nSupplementary Appendix I). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The impact of the Project will be enhanced regional cooperation through transmission \ninterconnectivity in the power sector between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The outcome of the \nProject will be (i) increased power export and income generation capacity of Tajikistan by \nincreasing the capacity of its south grid hydropower generation; (ii) restored power supply and \nreduced cost for consumers in Afghanistan; (iii) improved capacity of the utility operation of \nDABM, and (iv) improved commercial operation of BT. \n \nB.  Outputs  \n \n30.  The Project consists of Afghan and Tajik components.  \n \n1.  Afghan Component  \n \n      Part A: Transmission Line that includes: \n \n(i)  A new double-circuit river crossing at Sherkan Bandar city (50% to be financed \nunder the Tajik component).  \n(ii)  Approximately  157  km  of  new  double-circuit  220  kV  transmission  line  from \nSherkan Bandar river border crossing to Pul-e-Khumri via Kunduz and Baglan \nsubstations. \n(iii)  Demining  of  the  route  for  the  transmission  line  between  Pul-e-Khumri  and \nSherkan Bandar. \n \nPart B: Substations that includes: \n \n(i)  Construction of new 220kV switchyards at Kunduz and Baglan substations, and \nsupply and installation of high accuracy export/import metering equipment at the \nnew 220 kV switchyard of Kunduz substation, and  \n(ii)  connection  of  the  new  220  kV  transmission  line  to  the  220kV  Pul-e-Khumri \nsubstation. \n \n2.

Special Features \n \n1.  Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  \n \n31.  Under the intergovernmental agreement, both countries agreed that a PPA should be \nsigned and negotiated prior to contract award. The PPA will define: (i) the parties; (ii) the term of \nthe  PPA  (20  years);  (iii)  buyer  minimum  purchase  obligations;  (iv)  seller  minimum  supply \nobligation; (v) penalties for failure to supply or failure to sell; (vi) delivery and billing point; (vii) \nprice and terms of payment; (viii) condition for effectiveness; (ix) payment process and financial \nguarantees  on  the  seller  and  buyer  side  (access  to  necessary  property  and  construction \nfacilities and local labor, if any), and form and operation mode for cross-border assets. A copy of \nthe intergovernmental agreement is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n2.  Afghanistan \n \n32.  Private  Sector  Participation/Strengthening  DABM  and  North  Electric  Power \nSystem Capacity. In Afghanistan, the power sector needs large amounts of investment in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. The Government of Afghanistan has relied on aid \nfinance  to  meet  its  capital  expenditure,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are \nsometimes externally financed. It is unable to recover full operation cost and this is worsened by \ngrowing insecurity and safety concerns. The dependency on aid financing of the Government of \nAfghanistan is likely to continue in the short to medium term, as the overall investment climate is \nnot favorable to private or other investors. However, in the interim, aid financing will benefit the \nprivate  sector  by  reducing  operational,  regulatory,  and  policy  uncertainties.  Private  sector \nparticipation  will  take  two  forms:  (i)  large-scale  involvement  (not  necessarily  direct  equity \ninvestment) in generation to supply base load for Kabul or other main cities, and (ii) small-scale \ngeneration and distribution (by domestic entrepreneurs) in isolated rural areas. Private sector \ninvestment barely exists in the energy sector but it may be the only viable option to electrify \nlarge parts of the country quickly. Many years of war have left a weak power supply monopoly, \nunlike many other countries facing deregulation. Therefore, regulation, rules, and agencies\u2014\nwhile urgently needed\u2014must be carefully crafted so as not to discourage investment. \n \n33.  Ongoing  construction  of  the  transmission  line  from  Pul-e-Khumri  to  Kabul,  delayed \npreparation of the Second Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project under World Bank financing,  \n ", "9 \nrehabilitation of the Kabul distribution network, and the Project underscore the need for a timely \ndecision by the Government of Afghanistan on the management and operational arrangements \nfor these vital assets. The Government of Afghanistan appreciates the need to develop this \narrangement  and  carry  out  competitive  bidding  to  select  a  management  contractor  for              \n3\u20135 years. This arrangement will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DABM and North \nElectric Power System in delivering reliable power supply in Afghanistan. The financial viability \nand strength of DABM and North Electric Power System will be enhanced through improved \naccounts receivable management, asset management, business planning, and sound financial \nmanagement practices. ADB, together with the loan, will provide assistance along with the \nWorld Bank and other donors involved in the power sector in Afghanistan in identifying and \nfinancing the necessary preparatory works to enable private sector participation through a \nmanagement contract.  \n \n34.  Demining  Operations.  Although  the  major  portion  of  the  transmission  line  passes \nthrough cleared terrain, a few zones have been identified near Kunduz where demining will be \nrequired. The specialized agency selected under the bidding process will have to clear the route \nfor the development of the transmission network from Pul-e-Khumri to Shekhanbandar. An \nestimated $1 million for demining is included in the project loan amount.  \n \n35.  Project Implementation Unit. MEW will use the services of the existing PIU. ADB \nrequested MEW to add an additional staff member to the PIU to take the Project into account. \nMEW was also requested to appoint a dedicated full-time project director who will be in charge, \nin addition to the normal administrative tasks inherent to project management, to negotiate and \ncoordinate with the Tajik counterparts.   \n \n3.  Tajikistan \n \n36.  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Generation.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  has \nsucceeded in attracting foreign investors in the Tajik power sector. RAO Unified Energy System  \n(UES) of Russia is currently completing the 670 MW Sangtuda-I hydropower plant on the \nVakhsh River under a build-own-operate scheme. The Government of Iran has expressed \ninterest in the construction of Sangtuda-II (220 MW) hydropower plant on the same river under a \nbuild-operate-transfer  scheme.  Other  private  investors  have  expressed  interest  in  the \ndevelopment of new hydropower generation facilities. This will increase Tajikistan generation \ncapacity and allow firm power year-round exports. The Project provides an incentive for private \nsector participation in the form of an export market to Afghanistan and further to Pakistan. \n \n37.  Restructuring and Commercialization of BT. The energy sector plan, agreed under \nthe Power Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) in November 2000, required the implementation of \na restructuring plan for BT. The key requirements of this plan included: (i) implementation of the \nenergy  law,  (ii)  creation  of  a  ministry  of  energy,  (iii)  adoption  of  a  comprehensive \ncommercialization and corporatization plan for BT (by December 2003), and (iv) unbundling of \nBT into incorporated independent electricity companies by December 2004. \n \n38.  Most  of  the  elements  of  the  restructuring  plan  have  been  implemented. \nHowever, BT has not met the target date for unbundling. The consultants who are currently \nworking under this project recommended that managerial, commercial, financial, and technical \nskills should be identified and strengthened before the unbundling takes place. In preparation \nfor unbundling, ADB will, together with the loan, provide a TA that will set in place conditions to \nimprove  corporate  governance  of  BT  for  3\u20135  years  to  meet  agreed  financial,  technical, \noperational, and commercial objectives. A management contract will be pursued where the \ncontractor\u2019s performance will be measured by setting key performance indicator targets relating \n ", "10 \nto (i) improving the reliability of the electric power networks; (ii) expanding access to network \nservices; (iii) reducing costs and improving commercial operations, particularly in the area of \nbilling and collection; and (iv) improving corporate functions and processes, including enterprise \ngovernance. \n \n39.  Project Implementation Unit. The Government of Tajikistan has reformed the existing \nPIU within BT. Under the new arrangement, a centralized project management unit (PMU) will \nhandle  all  projects  in  the  power  sector  financed  by  international  finance  institutions.  The \ncentralized PMU will be managed and controlled by the Government of Tajikistan and financed \nby BT. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Project, ADB and the Government \nagreed to set up a separate PIU within BT with a project director reporting directly to the \nchairperson of BT. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n40.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $109.5  million  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  financing  charges  during  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  cost  of  the \nAfghanistan  component  is  $55.5  million  (inclusive  of  taxes  and  duties)  and  the  Tajikistan \ncomponent is estimated to cost $54.0 million (exclusive of taxes and duties).

The Government of Afghanistan has requested a loan of $35.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the Project which will cost $55.5 million. The loan in \nvarious currencies equivalent to $35.0 million in Special Drawing Rights will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years with an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The Government of Afghanistan will relend the loan proceeds denominated in \nlocal currency to DABM on the same terms as the ADB loan. The Government of Afghanistan \nhas approached the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and other cofinancers to \ncofinance the Project with a $16.5 million loan. It is assumed that the loan will be on the same \nterms  as  the  ADB  loan.  As  the  budget  for  infrastructure  projects  of  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan is limited, ADB and the co-financier have agreed to fund the entire investment with \na minimum contribution from the Government of Afghanistan of $4 million to cover local taxes \nand duties and security during construction.   \n \n43.  The Government of Tajikistan has requested a loan of $21.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project which will cost $54.0 million. The loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to $21.5 million in Special Drawing Rights will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years with an interest rate of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter. The Government of Tajikistan will relend the loan proceeds to BT, at an interest rate \napplicable to ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility with a grace period of 5 years and repayment \nperiod of 25 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. Cofinancing in \nthe amounts of $8.5 million from OFID will be provided on a joint basis and $10.0 million from \nIsDB, will be provided on a parallel basis on similar concessional terms as the ADB loan. BT will \nprovide  funding  of  $14.0  million,  partly  through  the  supply  of  aluminum  cables  for  the \ntransmission lines. However, it was made clear to BT that this did not imply that ADB condoned \nthe barter arrangement with TADAZ; rather, this was being done partly to help liquidate the idle \naluminum cable stock.   \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n  1.  Project Management \n \n44.  For Afghanistan, MEW will be the EA for the Project. It will have overall responsibility for \nimplementation of the Project\u2014specifically, the timely mobilization of counterpart financing and \ncofinancing, as required. It will carry out supervision of the works and issuance of work permits, \nsupervision of testing, and commissioning. DABM will be the IA and will be responsible for O&M \nof the facilities. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Project, MEW will appoint a \nfull-time project director who will be responsible\u2014in addition to the normal project tasks related \n ", "12 \nto project administration\u2014for coordinating with the Tajik counterparts to ensure the smooth and \ntimely progress of the Project. To mitigate the lack of skill and experience of the EA, the Project \nincludes provision of an advisory team in project administration as described in Appendix 15. \n \n45.  For Tajikistan, BT will be the EA for the Project. It will appoint a full-time project director \nwho  will  be  responsible\u2014in  addition  to  the  normal  project  tasks  related  to  project \nadministration\u2014for coordinating with the Afghan counterparts to ensure the smooth and timely \nprogress of the Project. A new and independent PIU will be set up for this Project.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n46.  The Project will be implemented in 24 months, with target completion by 31 March 2009 \nfor the Afghan and Tajik components of the transmission line. The other Tajik components are \nexpected to be completed by 30 June 2010. Project implementation will commence in February \n2007.  \n \n3.  Procurement   \n \n47.  All goods and services procured under the ADB and OFID loans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time), based on the \njoint  assessment  of  the  Borrower\u2019s  capacity  to  handle  the  procurement  activities.  For \nconstruction of the transmission line and in order to increase competition, it is envisaged to have \na single tender for both Afghan and Tajik components. However evaluation of the bid, contract \nnegotiations and contract award will be carried out separately for each component in order not \nto penalize the Tajik component with high costs experienced in past projects in Afghanistan. \nThe ongoing project preparatory TA6 will fund the preparation of the full bidding documents. This \nwill  permit  a  contract  to  be  signed  for  construction  in  early  2007  and  ensure  the  timely \ncommissioning of the line.   \n \n48.  The main packages (i.e., the transmission line and substation works) will be procured \nunder international competitive bidding (ICB) using a single-stage two-envelope procedure on \nthe basis of engineering, procurement, and construction contracts (turnkey contracts). Metering \nwill also be procured under ICB using the single-stage one-envelope procedure. For Tajikistan, \ninstallation of the meters will be done by BT staff as part of counterpart financing. Rehabilitation \nof canals, which will be entirely financed as counterpart financing, will be procured following \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n49.  Consulting services will be needed to assist BT and MEW/DABM in implementing the \nProject. The consultants will also assist BT and MEW/DABM in environmental management and \nmonitoring social and resettlement safeguards. In Afghanistan, international consulting services \n(about 45 person-months) and national consulting services (about 30 person-months) will be \nrequired for project management, detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, assistance \nin  procurement,  construction  supervision,  installation  of  equipment,  and  testing  and \ncommissioning  of  the  plants.  In  Tajikistan,  about  60  person-months  of  international  and \n80 person-months of national consulting services will be required. The consultants will also \nassist  BT  and  MEW/DABM  in  environmental  management  and  monitoring  social  and \nresettlement safeguards. All consultants will be recruited as a firm by BT and MEW/DABM in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Afghanistan for Preparing the National Power Transmission Grid Project. \nManila. \n ", "13 \nto  time)  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (full  technical  proposal).  The  consultant  is \nexpected  to  be  fielded  in  mid-2007.  The  outline  terms  of  reference for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n50.  ADB\u2019s policy Anticorruption (1998) will be enforced. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, the Government of Afghanistan and the \nGovernment of Tajikistan are aware that ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n51.  In particular for Tajikistan, payment of the electricity exports to Afghanistan will be done \nthrough  a  transit  account  established  at  a  nominated  bank  for  the  purposes  of  collecting \nrevenues generated by supply of electricity to Afghanistan. The details of the account will be \nprovided in the PPA. The funds accumulated in this account will be used by BT exclusively for \nthe purposes of maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing facilities and for new investments \nby agreement with the Government of Tajikistan. The account will be subject to annual audit by \nan external auditor acceptable to ADB.   \n \n52.  BT and MEW/DABM will establish within 1 year from the date of effectiveness a website \nthat will present information on externally funded projects. For this Project, the website will \nprovide  information  on,  among  others,  financial  statements  of  BT  and  MEW/DABM;  and \nprocurement activities, including the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, \nbasic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of goods \nand/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n53.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). Direct payment procedures will be utilized for the procurement \nand consulting services contracts. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n54.  There will be continued monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, with timely \nreporting deadlines. MEW and BT (as EAs under the Project) will prepare quarterly reports on \nthe progress of project implementation and provide ADB and the co-financiers with copies of \nthese reports. ADB will review the implementation of the Project on a regular basis, at least \nonce a year, and will monitor overall performance of each of the EAs and DABM. Within \n3 months of project completion, each of the EAs will provide ADB with a project completion \nreport covering details of implementation and other information required by ADB. Each of the \nEAs will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project and will have the accounts \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited  project \naccounts will be provided to ADB within 6 months of the end of each relevant fiscal year.  \n \n \n \n ", "14 \n8.  Project Performance Management System \n \n55.  Each of the governments, through the EA and with the assistance of the implementation \nconsultants,  will  establish  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  a  comprehensive  project \nperformance  management  system  acceptable  to  ADB  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  project \nperformance as a whole, as well as delivery of the planned facilities and project benefits under \nthe Afghan and Tajik components.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n56.  Regular annual ADB review missions will be undertaken to discuss the latest progress, \nand address current and emerging problems by developing mitigating measures. An in-depth \nmidterm review will be undertaken not later than in 2008 by ADB together with the EAs, the IA, \nand co-financiers, as appropriate to assess whether the project outcomes are likely to be \nachieved. The midterm review will focus on relevant institutional, administrative, organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \n \nG.  Executing Agencies \n \n1.  Afghanistan \n \n57.  DABM, is responsible to MEW for O&M of the country\u2019s generation, transmission, and \ndistribution assets as well as for metering, billing, and revenue collection. It employs about \n5,400 people. \n \n58.  Financial  Management  and  Sustainability.  Financial  management  assessment  of \nDABM  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  its  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary \nrequirements for the Project. While the financial management for the IA has been improving \nover  the  last  few  years,  it  was  still  found  to  be  unsatisfactory.  Capacity  and  institutional \ndevelopment  have  been  proposed  under  the  Project,  which  will  help  to  further  strengthen \nfinancial management capacity. A World Bank-funded program is currently in place to improve \nthe financial management of DABM, including improvement of its accounting systems and billing \nand collection. The ADB-proposed attached TA will further strengthen DABM\u2019s capacity in \naccounting and financial management, which would further improve the financial management \nof DABM in the short to medium term. \n \n59.  A review of DABM\u2019s past financial accounts showed that it had insufficient cash flow to \neven meet its operational requirements and that its financial position needs to be significantly \nimproved. Recognizing this, on 23 September 2006, the Government of Afghanistan increased \nthe average tariff by almost 100% to $0.083/kWh. This tariff increase, together with the benefit \nof cheap imported electricity from the Project, will substantially improve its financial situation. \nAssuming  continued  annual  tariff  increases  at  the  rate  of  inflation,  DABM  will  be  able  to \ngenerate  sufficient  cash  flows  to  cover  operating  costs  and  meet  its  future  debt  servicing \nobligations. The summary projected income statement, cash flow, and a balance sheet are in \nAppendix 8 and detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n2.  Tajikistan \n \n60.  The EA for the Tajikistan component, BT, is responsible for the O&M of the power sector \nfor most of the country including generation, transmission, and distribution. BT, which reports to \nMOE, employed 9,800 staff in 2005.  \n ", "15 \n \n61.  Financial Management and Sustainability. Financial management assessment of BT \nwas satisfactory, but further strengthening of institutional and financial capacity will be needed \nto meet best practice standards. Under the Project, TA support for commercialization of BT will \nbe provided and a management contract will be pursued.  \n \n62.  A review of the past financial statements indicates that revenues are only sufficient to \ncover current operating expenses. Tariff increases are badly needed for financial sustainability. \nWith  the  commitment  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  to  increase  the  current  tariffs \nprogressively from an average of $0.006/kWh to $0.021/kWh (in 2003 terms) by 2010, and \npartly assisted by the incremental income from the Project, BT\u2019s financial situation is expected \nto improve greatly and will enable it to meet its operating costs and future debt servicing \nobligations. The summary projected income statement, cash flow, and a balance sheet are in \nAppendix 8 and detailed analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n63.  The Project includes two TAs to improve the capacity of IAs both in Afghanistan and \nTajikistan. The rationale and details of the TAs are discussed below. \n \n64.  Afghanistan TA. This is designed to improve the capacity of DABM in utility operations. \nDABM  depends  heavily  on  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  and  donor  support  to  fund  its \noperational  and  capital  expenditure  programs.  It  is  necessary  to  improve  the  institutional, \ntechnical,  and  financial  capacity  of  DABM.  Two  key  areas  would  improve  DABM\u2019s  overall \nperformance:  (i)  strengthening  institutional  and  management  capacity  to  meet  operational \ndemands, and (ii) improving and expanding the capacity for technical employees of DABM. The \nTA is expected to start by March 2007 and be completed by March 2009. \n \n65.  Strengthening the institutional management capacity of DABM will make it able to handle \nroutine  operational  work  in  the  areas  of  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management,  and \naccounting. Of these, special attention should be given to improvement of billing, collection, and \nmetering skills. Improving and expanding capacity for technical employees of DABM is the \nsecond  area  of  the  TA.  While  capacity  improvement  through  intensive  training  courses  in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution is needed for DABM, training priority should be given \nto transmission because of the nature of the Project. Therefore, setting up long-term training \ncourses for DABM\u2019s current staff and future employees is for the long-term sustainability of the \nProject. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,320,000. The TA will be entirely financed on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program in the amount of $1,200,000. The government of \nAfghanistan  will  finance  the  remaining  $120,000  through  in-kind  contribution.  The  TA  will \nfinance the services of international consultants for 20 person-months and national consultants \nfor 45 person-months. They will be recruited as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  (full  technical \nproposal). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 13. \n \n66.  Tajikistan TA. This is designed to strengthen and improve internal management and \ncustomer responsiveness and reliability of BT, a public-owned power company in Tajikistan. \nBT\u2019s management and institutional capacity have been improved but its services are still poor \nand inefficient. While unbundling is the long-term solution and a target for BT in the short term, \nBT needs to develop and establish an efficient management and rational institutional structure \nto effectively design and control the planning, budgeting, revenue management, and corporate \naccounting system. These skills should be identified and good corporate governance practices \n ", "16 \nshould  be  in  place  before  BT\u2019s  unbundling  takes  place.  The  TA  is  expected  to  start  by \nMarch 2007 and be completed by September 2009. \n \n67.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be:  (i)  preparation  of  the  legal  framework  enabling  the \nimplementation of a management or similar form of contract; (ii) definition of performance \ncriteria (commercial, financial, and technical); and (iii) selection of a management contractor for \n3\u20135  years  to  introduce  corporate  governance  within  BT  and  to  improve  the  financial  and \ntechnical efficiency of the power utility to pave the way to further unbundling and privatization. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,800,000  equivalent.  As  requested  by  the  Government  of \nTajikistan, ADB will provide $1,500,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Tajikistan will finance \nthe remaining cost equivalent to $300,000 through in-kind contribution. The TA will finance the \nservices of international consultants for 40 person-months and national consultants for 110 \nperson-months. They will be recruited as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time) using the quality and cost-based \nselection method (full-technical proposal). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 14. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Financial and Economic Assessment \n \n68.  All the components of the Project are part of the least-cost development program. The \nProject considered transmission supply alternatives to Kabul and related areas with grid supply \nto replace small-scale isolated diesel generation (with cost as high as $0.33/kwh). The Project is \nthe most effective way to provide reliable and affordable power supply in Afghanistan. On an \nincremental basis, the Project will greatly increase power capacity to provide relatively cheap \nand low-cost electricity supply to households and enterprises. The rehabilitation components in \nTajikistan will increase power generation and export capacity in a cost-effective manner. \n \n69.  The financial analysis of the Project was conducted from the perspective of DABM and \nBT. The analysis is based on total capital costs, including physical contingencies and taxes but \nexcluding price contingencies and financing charges. Only incremental costs and revenues \nhave been included in cash flows. \n \n70.  For Afghanistan, the financial benefits of the transmission interconnection are significant, \ngiven the high level of unserved demand for electricity and the average tariff of $0.083/kWh. In \naddition,  Afghanistan will  invest  in  two  substations  along  the  route  of  the  line,  in  Kunduz \n(population 950,000) and Baglan provinces (population 850,000). The substations will permit \nincremental electricity sale to meet unserved demand in these towns. However, to realize the \nfull value of the substations, additional downstream distribution costs of $15 million and $10 \nmillion, spread over 5 years, have been included into the costs of the Kunduz and Baglan \nsubstations. This cost will be borne by the Government of Afghanistan after completion of the \nsubstations.  In  Afghanistan,  security  concerns  increased  the  operational  costs  for  the \ntransmission line by 33%, compared with those in Tajikistan.  \n \n71.  For Tajikistan, the financial benefit is from the export of incremental hydroelectricity \nwhich has no alternative value in summer when river flows are high. Assuming a sale price of \n$0.025/kWh at the border, it will be a win-win situation for both countries. Additional investments \ninclude upgrading and rehabilitation of four HPPs in the Vaskh River Cascade. The investments, \nwhich will result in an average incremental generation capacity of 320 GWh per year, will help \nreduce the winter electricity shortfall in Tajikistan. \n \n ", "17 \n72.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and the financial projections in nominal terms were converted \nto real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuations. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of \nthe EAs, BT, and DABM, under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, is 12.4% for the Afghanistan component and \n20.8% for the Tajikistan component. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax basis, of 0% for Afghanistan and 3.0% for \nTajikistan. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Detailed analysis is in Appendix 9.  \n \n73.  Economic analysis was conducted for the Project. To test the economic viability of the \nProject, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated on the basis of incremental \ncost-and-benefit  streams  associated  with  each  project.  Economic  returns  are  high  for  the \nProject. This stems from the new transmission link which enables Tajikistan to export its surplus \nhydropower energy to mitigate the power shortage in Afghanistan. Willingness to pay was \nestimated considering the current cost of diesel generation of $0.33/kWh. Financial costs were \nadjusted to reflect the true economic opportunities forgone and realized because of the Project. \nFor Tajikistan, an export price of $0.025/kWh was used as calculation base for border price. For \nTajikistan, the EIRR of the Project was 31.1%\u201415.7% for the hydropower plant component and \n40.1% for the transmission line. For Afghanistan, the EIRR of the Project was 31.0%\u201439.6% for \nthe transmission line part and 19.8% for the Kunduz/Baglan part. \n \n74.  Various financial and economic sensitivity analyses were conducted, including capital \ncost increases, benefits (volume and/or tariff) decreases, and delay in implementation. The \nfinancial  sensitivity  analysis  showed  some  low  returns  in  the  Afghanistan  case  but  still \nexceeding the WACC. However, the EIRR values remained well above the 12% cutoff for all \nscenarios. In addition, political instability and security will also affect project implementation. \nThis is particularly important for Afghanistan where project risks are high. Although it is difficult \nto quantify such damage to the Project, political instability and security will mostly cause the \nProject cost increase and implementation delay. The calculation results showed that with 30%  \ncost increase and one-year delay, the FIRR was acceptable at 7.5% and the EIRR was 19.6%, \nstill above 12%. Analysis is provided in Appendix 9 and detailed analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n75.  Distribution of economic benefits arising from the Project in Tajikistan and from savings \nof imported electricity of the Project in Afghanistan was calculated at a discount rate of 12%. \nThe poverty impact analysis showed that 53% of economic benefits will go to poor people living \nbelow the official poverty line in Afghanistan and 54% of economic benefits will go to the poor in \nTajikistan. \n   \nB.  Regional Benefits \n \n76.  This regional Project will generate additional revenues to the Tajik economy and lower \nthe cost of power for consumers in the Afghan economy. The power trade under the Project will \nfacilitate economic growth to bring additional benefits to the region.  \n \n77.  Distribution analysis for regional cooperation was conducted to examine the distribution \nof  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  for  the  two  countries,  using  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and \nassumptions for discount rate, price numeraire, constant price, and standard conversion factor \nadjustment. Through this Project, increased trade is an additional benefit for the region as the \nProject will promote trade in electricity and trade from other areas. The net economic benefits of \n ", "18 \nregional cooperation from trade are estimated at $114.3 million at 12% of discount rate for both \ncountries. It is estimated that Tajikistan would share 47% of the benefits and Afghanistan should \nshare 53% of the benefits from the Project. Therefore, the Project is a win-win example of \nregional cooperation. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impacts  \n \n78.  Land acquisition or impacts on crops will be extremely limited\u2014both for the Afghanistan \nand the Tajikistan components of the Project\u2014and will depend only on the construction of tower \nbases  and expansion of  Baglan substation.  All  other  items  constructed  under the  Project, \nincluding temporary access roads, will have no impacts on property and livelihoods. No house \nwill be affected and no resettlement is needed in either country. In Afghanistan, most of the \ntransmission line will pass over unused desert land where impacts will be greatly limited by \nlocating the towers within the tower footing of an old Soviet line in disuse or by using poles \ninstead of towers. In Tajikistan, most of the transmission line will pass in unused desert land and \nimpacts will occur only where the transmission line has to cross strips of cultivated land. To plan \nthe compensation program, the EAs have prepared a short resettlement plan (RP) for each \ncomponent. Each RP fits the relevant national law/regulation and ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. The RPs provide \nimpacts figures, describe the compensation and rehabilitation framework, and detail all RP \nimplementation mechanisms/responsibilities. After detailed design completion, the RP will be \nreviewed and, if necessary, updated as a condition for approval of the civil works contract. \nImplementation of the RP in accordance with ADB requirements will be a condition for the notice \nto  proceed  with  civil  works  mobilization.  The  Afghanistan  and  the  Tajikistan  RPs  are \nsummarized in Appendix 11, and are in Supplementary Appendixes G and H.  \n \n79.  No project-affected person in Afghanistan or Tajikistan fits the definition of indigenous \nperson provided by The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Therefore, there will be no \nimpact on indigenous peoples from either of the project components.   \n \nD.  Poverty and Social Assessment \n \n80.  In Afghanistan, the Project will (i) provide cheap electricity and improved summer power \nsupplies to Afghanistan, which will ensure continuous provision of electricity to local users and \nlessen the country\u2019s dependence on other much more expensive indigenous or foreign sources; \nand (ii) provide savings that will influence year-round power flows and allow greater purchasing \nability during winter. The gains obtained will directly benefit the poor as money saved in summer \nmonths  will  translate  to  lower  year-round  tariffs  for  them.  In  Tajikistan,  the  Project  will  (i) \nincrease the budget needed to improve the availability of electricity during winter by selling part \nof its summer hydropower surplus to Afghanistan; and (ii) permit improvement of the efficiency \nof the sources of indigenous winter power, develop new generating assets, or increase the \ncountry\u2019s purchasing capacity for additional winter power imports. Greater year-round access to \nelectricity  in  Afghanistan  and  Tajikistan  will  also  indirectly  benefit  poor  and  vulnerable \nconsumers by allowing more efficient operations to hospitals, schools, and other social utilities, \nwhich are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply and quality. Improved power supplies \nwill also encourage light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment opportunities \nand  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the  manufacturing  and  agriculture \nsectors.  \n \n \n \n ", "19 \nE.  Environmental Impacts  \n \n81.  The Project is classified category \u201cB\u201d. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for both \nthe  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  components  of  the  Project  were  prepared,  anticipating \ninsignificant environmental impacts which can be readily mitigated by the implementation of \nstandard mitigation measures and good engineering practices in the design and construction of \ntransmission lines, access roads, canal excavation, and spoil management. Such measures are \nspecified in both environmental management plans (EMPs) and relevant contract documents. \nFurthermore,  any  minor  environmental  impacts  are  offset  by  the  environmental  benefits, \nespecially the additional power generation without extra greenhouse gas emission from the \nProject.  Minimal  impact  is  expected  on  any  ecologically  important  area  and  the  nearest \nprotected area, the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve, is at least 11.5 km from the alignment. \nThe biophysical resources along the proposed transmission line alignment and the project \nfacilities are areas of low habitat value, mainly comprising sparsely vegetated semidesert areas. \nOn the Tajikistan side, there are numerous existing transmission lines and towers, and the \nProject  will  create  negligible  additional  visual  impacts.  Little  cumulative  impacts,  including \ntransboundary  or  induced  impacts,  are  expected  mainly  because  no  new  hydropower \ngeneration will be added. Therefore, no modification of the actual water flows are expected \nwhich might affect riparian countries. \n  \n82.  BT is responsible for adequate implementation of the EMP for the Tajikistan component. \nIt currently has an environmental monitoring unit which received on-the-job training from the \nimplementation consultant of the Power Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6), and is considered to \nhave the experience and capacity to undertake environmental management functions for the \nProject. MEW is its counterpart on the Afghan side. Since MEW currently has limited capacity, \ntraining of staff in environmental management will be necessary. This will be undertaken by an \ninternational environmental specialist during project implementation. Effective implementation of \nthe EMP will be monitored throughout each phase of the Project.   \n \nF.  Project Risks \n \n83.  The overall political and security situation remains volatile and uncertain in Afghanistan. \nSuch instability might create delays in implementation and cost overruns. A longer-term issue is \nthe  post-construction  security  of  the  transmission  line  asset,  hence  its  ability  to  indirectly \ngenerate  cash  flows  to  repay  the  loan.  An  interministerial  committee  was  set  up  in \nSeptember 2006 and will continue to provide guidance on all security matters. \n \n84.  Adequate coordination with other donors and agencies will ensure that all components \nnecessary to supply Kabul will be in place when the interconnection between the two countries \nis ready. These include not only the completion of the Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul transmission line \nbut also rehabilitation of the distribution system in Kabul. \n \n85.  Weakness of the EA in both countries could lead to delays in implementation. However, \nsteps have been taken to mitigate this risk (paras. 23 and 44). \n \n86.  Lack of financial capability from the Afghan side to pay for the power imports is a risk. \nAverage tariff levels were increased by 100% in September 2006, which will help the ability of \nDABM to pay for power imports. It is envisaged that DABM will obtain a bank guarantee \ncovering up to 2 months of import, which will further mitigate this risk.  \n \n ", "20 \n87.  Regular tariff increases over the next few years in Tajikistan are necessary to ensure \nthat the EA is able to generate electricity and service the debt. The governments have recently \ntaken steps to increase tariffs and have initiated significant tariff increases. \n \n88.  There are potential risks of inadequate EMP implementation because MEW has limited \nenvironmental capacity. Training of MEW staff in environmental management and monitoring, \nwhich will be provided initially by an international environmental specialist included in the project \nimplementation  consultant\u2019s  team,  will  be  necessary  to  establish  routine  environmental \nmonitoring protocols, and undertake periodic environmental monitoring and audit of construction \nworks during construction. Risks on inadequate EMP implementation can thus be minimized.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n89.  In addition to the standard assurances, the governments of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, \nDABM , BT, and MEW have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in their \nrespective legal documents. \n \n90.

The details \nof the account must be provided in the PPA. The funds accumulated in this \naccount will be used by BT exclusively for the purposes of maintenance and \nrehabilitation of the existing facilities and for new investments by agreement with \nthe Government of Tajikistan. The account will be subject to annual audit by an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB. \n(iv)  During 1 year of project effectiveness, the EAs and/or DABM will establish a \nwebsite  that  will  present  information  on  externally  funded  projects.  For  this \nProject,  the  website  will  provide  information  on,  among  others,  financial \nstatements of BT and MEW/DABM, as appropriate; and procurement activities \nincluding list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on \nbidding procedures adopted, amount of the contracts awarded, the list of goods \nand/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization. \n \n96.  Environmental Measures. Each of the governments will ensure that: \n \n(i)  The  preparation,  design,  construction,  implementation,  and  operation  of  the \nProject is carried out in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and the agreed IEE, and all monitoring and mitigation \nmeasures identified in the EMP are implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(ii)  Contracts with civil works contractors will comply with the IEE. \n \n ", "22 \n(vii)  Adequate funds are provided annually for O&M and the project facilities are \noperated  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  all  national  safety  and  O&M \nguidelines,  including  safe  storage  of  construction,  rehabilitation,  and \nmaintenance materials to prevent contamination of soil and water with fuel and \nlubricants or any hazardous materials. \n(viii)  The EAs will ensure that each quarterly progress report to be provided to ADB \nincludes information on the implementation of the IEE. \n \n97.

Afghanistan1 \n \n1.  Power Sector \n \n1.  The power sector is one of the least developed sectors in Afghanistan, and it is the main \nbottleneck for economic development. Afghanistan is well endowed with hydropower, natural \ngas, and coal. Some estimates put hydropower potential at 25,000 megawatt (MW), of which \n5,000 MW are inside Afghanistan and the rest on the border of Amu Darya. Hydropower is the \nkey source (about 75% of total) of power supply in Afghanistan. The main dams are Kajakai in \nHelmand  Province  near  Kandahar,  Mahipar,  and  Breshna-Kot  in  Nangarhar  Province  near \nJalalabad; and Dahla in Kandahar Province. Kabul is fed by three hydroelectric power stations, \nwith a combined output of 80 MW (nameplate rating of 188 MW). \n \n2.  Total  generation  capacity  has  declined  from  about  456  MW  in  the  1990s  to  about \n250 MW  in  2006.  Only  about  6\u20139%  of  the  population  has  access  to  power,  of  which \napproximately 30% is in Kabul. The other provinces have even less access, with rural areas \nbeing virtually unserved. Before the conflict in 1980, power transmission lines comprised about \n140 circuit-kilometers (km) of 220 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines and about 1,080 circuit-km of \n110 kV transmission lines. Many were destroyed during the war and only some 110 kV lines are \nnow operating. The damaged 220 kV lines have been downgraded to operate at 110 kV while \nsome damaged 110 kV lines now operate at 35 kV. \n \n2.  Demand Scenarios \n \n3.  Energy demand forecasts have been made by ongoing studies on the power sector \nmaster plan (up to 2020) and the gas development master plan (up to 2025). The power \ndemand forecast is based on adjusted actual energy sales of 2002. Adjusted demand includes \nsuppressed demand, which is around 75% of the energy supplied. In the basic forecast, energy \ndemand is assumed to reach 3,861 gigawatt-hour (GWh) in 2020, giving an average annual \ngrowth rate of 6.3%. In the high forecast, energy demand is assumed to reach 5,640 GWh in \n2020, or 46% higher than the basic forecast, implying an average growth rate of 8.2%. \n \n4.  The present peak load is assumed at around 215 MW for all of Afghanistan. Adding a \nsuppressed demand assumed to be 138 MW, the peak load starting point for the forecasts is \n363 MW. In the basic forecast, the peak load is assumed to increase to 911 MW in 2020. This \ngives an average annual growth rate of 5.2%. The growth rate for the peak load is somewhat \nlower than the growth rate for energy demand since the load factor is assumed to increase \nduring the forecast period. In the high forecast, the peak load is assumed to increase to \n1,316 MW in 2020. This gives an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. \n \n3.  Supply Options \n \n5.  Business as Usual. Business as usual assumes that the existing practices of energy \ndevelopment will continue without any changes in strategy. Development of known hydropower, \nnatural gas, oil, and coal reserves will continue; indigenous hydropower, natural gas, and coal \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Additional  issues  included  in  the  reference  option  are \n(i) enhancement of exploration, appraisal, and extraction of indigenous nonrenewable energy \nresources; (ii) implementation of effective programs to conserve energy; and (iii) integration of \ncommercial energy and biomass fuels program to maintain a sustainable supply of biomass \nfuels.  Exploration  and  appraisal  of  oil  and  natural  gas  will  be  enhanced;  development  of \nhydropower, natural gas, and coal will continue; new and renewable energy sources will be \nharnessed; a program will be undertaken to conserve commercial energy and biomass fuels; \nand development of biomass fuels will be considered along with the development of commercial \nenergy sources. \n \n7.  A business-as-usual scenario would put a strain on the economy with a sharp increase \nin energy demand. It would require additional fuel because of a lack of energy conservation \nmeasures, and may cause severe environmental degradation caused by overexploitation of \nbiomass fuels. The analysis used the reference option. \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  power  sector  master  plan  estimates  over  $1.5  billion  for  the \nrecommended generation and transmission development plan up to 2020 whereas the World \nBank estimates a requirement of about $1.9 billion on generation and transmission alone for the \nnext 7 years. Distribution will require another $800 million, according to the master plan. \n \n4.  Sector Road Map and Sustainability \n \n9.  The Government has developed a detailed road map for the power sector (Table A2.1). \nIn  the  preparatory  phase,  focus  will  be  on  capacity  building,  improvement  of  billing  and \ncollection, theft control, and development of a master plan. To date, the Government has met its \ntargets. In the medium term (2005\u20132007), the focus will be on developing a power sector law, \nestablishing independent regulation, separating generation from distribution, commercializing \nKabul Distribution Company, and finalizing key transmission infrastructure. The longer-term \ntarget is the establishment of a national transmission grid and increased access to 75% for \nhouseholds. \n \n10.  The power sector\u2019s ability to provide sustainable economic and social benefits will need \nreliable infrastructure (investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution); capable \ninstitutions; and appropriate cost recovery. While investment in infrastructure is not an essential \nprecondition for sustainability in other countries, the power sector of Afghanistan will not be able \nto deliver basic services to existing consumers without investment. Table A4.2 summarizes the \ninitiative by the Government and other donors to ensure the overall sustainability of the power \nsector. \n ", "     \nTABLE A2.1: AFGHANISTAN POWER SECTOR ROAD MAP \n \nPhase  Preparatory Phase  Intermediate Phase  Long-Term Phase  Results \nActivities  2003\u20132004  2005\u20132007  2008\u20132010   \nLegislation  \u2022  New constitution enacted  \u2022  Power sector law enacted    \u2022  Comprehensive power \n  \u2022  National economic legislation completed  \u2022  Law and regulations  sector regulation is \n\u2022  MWP policy framework approved  completed and implemented  functional \n   \n\u2022  Power sector law prepared \n \nRegulator  \u2022  Capacity building in MWP on regulation  \u2022  Independent regulatory agency  \u2022  Independent regulatory  \u2022  The regulatory agency is \n  functions  created  agency fully operational  operating independently \n\u2022  MWP continues to adjust tariffs in Kabul to   \ncost-recovering levels \n\u2022  Study on future industry structure completed \nUtility  \u2022  Basic commercialization activities  \u2022  Separate generation and  \u2022  Generation and  \u2022  Distribution and \nOperation  undertaken  distribution companies  distribution companies  generation companies \n  \u2022  Billing and collection  established according to the  ready for deeper private  provide efficient and \npolicy framework  sector participation  reliable power with \n\u2022  Accounting systems \n\u2022  KDC created and a    private sector \n\u2022  Cost of service analysis  management contract awarded  participation \n\u2022  Metering and connections    \u2022  The Government has a \n\u2022  Theft control  subsidiary role in the \n\u2022  New connections  sector \n \nPhysical  \u2022  Master plan for power sector completed  \u2022  Hairitan\u2013Kabul transmission  \u2022  KDC connected 200,000  \u2022  40% access is achieved \nInfrastructure  \u2022  Reconstruction projects are completed  line constructed  new customers  (from 4\u20136% today) \n \n(ADB, German development cooperation  \u2022  IDA and soft loans finance new  \u2022  New generation installed  \u2022  Overall system losses \nthrough KfW, World Bank)  projects in KDC (200,000 new  in the order of 200 MW  are reduced from 40\u2013\n\u2022  Study/plan for Kabul and major provincial  customers connected)  \u2022  Electricity reaches 75% of  50% to  20\u201330% \ncities distribution network completed  \u2022  MEW constructs new  all districts   \n\u2022  Key feasibility studies initiated  distribution projects around the  \u2022  Backbone of national \n\u2022  Implementation of urgent priority projects  country (200,000 new  transmission grid \naccording to master plan initiated  customers connected)  constructed  Ap\n\u2022  Study on options to expand rural access  \u2022  Master plan priority generation    pen\nand transmission projects  d\n  initiated  ix 2\n\u2022  Rural electrification program   \nimplemented \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KDC = Kabul Distribution Company, KfW= Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, MEW = Ministry of Energy and Water, MW = megawatt, \n2\nMWP = Ministry of Water and Power.   9\nSource: World Bank 2004, Report No. T762-AFG, Appendix 2.\n ", "     \n3\n0\n \nTable A2.2: SUSTAINABILITY OF AFGHANISTAN\u2019S POWER SECTOR \n \nA\nDrivers  Existing Condition  Medium-Term Scenario  p\np\n(activities by donors and Government)  en\nd\n1.

Tajikistan \n \n1.  Sector Overview \n \n11.  Tajikistan has abundant hydropower resources, which are a cheap source of electricity \ngeneration that can be easily exported to neighboring countries. Experts estimate that less than \n10% of its 40,000 megawatt (MW) potential is currently utilized. Nurek\u2014the largest hydropower \nplant, with capacity of 3,000 MW\u2014has insufficient storage, so it spills water every summer but \ncannot supply a winter deficit of about 1,800 gigawatt-hour (GWh). \n \n12.  In winter, hydropower generation depends on storage of water in reservoirs. When \nstorage level depletes, the country has to rely on imported oil, gas, and coal to meet its energy \nrequirements. Tajikistan imports electricity from Uzbekistan from January until April every year, \ndespite self-sufficiency in installed generation capacity. \n \n13.  At the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the Office of the \nPresident  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  energy  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  (MOE), \nestablished in October 2000, is responsible for implementation of the Government energy\u2019s \npolicy.  The  Agency  on  Anti  Monopoly  Policy  and  Entrepreneurship  acts  according  to  the \nprovisions of the Law on Natural Monopolies and regulates the tariffs on electricity, gas, and \ndistrict heat. It reports directly to the Office of the President. A separate regulatory body for the \nsector does not exist. \n \n14.  At the operating level, the power sector is the responsibility of the joint stock company \nBarki Tajik1 (BT), a vertically integrated company in charge of generation, transmission, and \ndistribution of electricity and heat2 for the whole country\u2014except the Gorno Badakshan region \nwhere a 25-year concession period was given to a private company, Pamir Energy, in 2002. \nUnder the present institutional arrangement, BT consists of a network of 10 subsidiary power \ngeneration companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting companies (such \nas a research institute and a construction company). It serves a customer base of 969,754 and \nemployed 9,772 staff in 2005. BT reports to MOE. \n \n15.  BT\u2019s  transmission  network  consists  of  three  separate  grids:  (i)  one  in  the  north  in \n220 kilovolt (kV) connecting the sole hydropower plant (Kairaikum hydropower plant\u2014240 MW); \n(ii) the central grid with an installed generation capacity of 3,895 MW; and (iii) one in the west in \nthe Gorno Badakshan region. \n \n16.  As in many former Soviet republics, 100% of the population has access to the electricity \ngrid, and BT\u2014despite scarce resources and investment since the fall of the Soviet Union\u2014has \nmaintained supply to all connected customers.  \n \n17.  The operational and financial performance of BT has improved over the last 5 years. \nHowever, technical and nontechnical losses in the transmission and distribution systems are still \nhigh (estimated to be around 20% technical and 20% nontechnical).  \n \n                                                 \n1  BT became a joint stock company by Decree No. 272 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Tajikistan of 24 July 1992.  \n2   BT is responsible for heat supply to Dushanbe and Khujand only. The heat and power combined plant in Yavan \nhas not been in operation since 1997.  \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n2.  Government Policy and Sector Reforms \na.  Government Policy \n \n18.  The Government has approved a strategic plan to improve the overall situation in the \nelectricity sector, as part of a general plan to rationalize the availability and utilization of energy \nin Tajikistan, including gas and heating. \n \n19.  It is taking a two-track approach to energy sector development: \n(i)  The  first  track  focuses  on  the  domestic  energy  sector,  taking  a  sector-wide \napproach by covering the electricity, gas, and heating sectors. The main aim of \nthis track is the recovery of the domestic energy sector, for which purpose the \nGovernment is intending to take a series of policy and investment measures.  \n(ii)  The second track of the development strategy is oriented toward export markets. \nThis strategy calls for realizing the sector\u2019s significant potential to contribute to \nmeeting the country\u2019s economic growth through electricity exports. At present, \nthere are electricity surpluses in the summer which are already being exported to \nneighboring Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia. It is intended to \nintensify  these  exports  and  secure  more  long-term  contracts  for  existing \nsurpluses.  \n \n20.  A number of policy measures are also being considered by the Government to support \nthe implementation of its strategy for the energy sector. These include the following. \n \n(i)  Revised energy pricing policy. In the power sector, despite tariff increases in \nthe past few years, the current tariffs are quite low compared with the financial \nviability level of $0.021/kWh in constant terms. The Government is proposing a \ngradual yearly increase of tariffs from 1 January 2007 to bring them to cost \nrecovery by the end of 2010. The Government will also take measures for large \nconsumers,  including  Tursunzade  Aluminum  Smelter  (TADAZ),  to  pay  their \narrears  for  electric  power  consumed  and  to  make  advance  payments  for \nelectricity in the future.  \n(ii)  Loss reduction and improved revenue collection program. A loss reduction \nprogram sponsored by the World Bank is under implementation for the electricity \nand gas sectors, which will initially focus on reducing commercial losses and \nimproving  collections.  Metering  devices  will  be  replaced  and  modern  billing \nsystems will be introduced. \n(iii)  Energy efficiency program. A program will be implemented which comprises \nenergy demand side management and efficiency enhancement. On demand side \nmanagement,  within  the  expected  TADAZ  concession  contract  between  the \nGovernment and the joint stock company Russian Aluminum, efforts will be made \nto  shift  the  bulk  of  TADAZ  production  from  winter  to  summer  to  facilitate \nelimination of winter electricity deficits. \n(iv)  Increasing energy supply. Options for increasing energy supply, particularly \nduring the winter months, are being investigated. These include rehabilitation and \nmodernization of Nurek HPP, Kairakum HPP, Golovnaya HPP, and cascade of \nVarzob HPPs, which will allow the installed generating capacity to be increased \nby 500\u2013550 MW.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \n \n    b.  Sector Reforms   \n \n21.  The Government set up a high-level working group, headed by the energy minister, to \nlead restructuring via a presidential decree dated 3 June 2003. On 9 December 2004, MOE set \nup a commission to draw up a plan for restructuring of BT in accordance with instructions issued \nby the Government. The commission\u2019s report3 was submitted for review to the Government on \n14 July 2005. The report envisages a cautious approach to restructuring, with unbundling taking \nplace in a number of stages within a conservative time frame.  \n \n22.  The commission report recommends the following to be achieved by 2008: \n \n(i)  Creation of a single company that will own and operate the installed generation \ncapacity and transmission lines above 110 kV. \n(ii)  Establishment of three distribution companies: one for Sogd region; one for the \ncentral region, including the city of Dushanbe and its regions; and one for the \nKhatlon region. \n \n23.  During the second phase of the reforms from 2008 to 2012, the Commission proposes to \nseparate the generation and the transmission lines above 110 kV into two separate companies. \n \nc.  Tariffs and Revenue Collection \n24.  The tariff system is intended to be cost-based and is inherited from the Soviet time. \nTariffs are calculated based on expenses divided by the total electricity transmitted and a profit \nelement that is currently set at 15%.  \n \n25.  BT has made a number of efforts to improve revenue collection, including reducing the \ncategory of consumers from seven (industrial, agricultural, pumps and pumps stations for water \nsupply, nonindustrial, communal utilities enterprises, city electric transport, and residential) to \nthree (industrial, budget, and residential).  \n \n26.  The Government has increased electricity tariffs to improve cost recovery since 2000, \nbut in a moderate way. From January 2007 onward, the Government has committed to make a \nsubstantial increase with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. \n \n27.  Since the enforcement of a disconnection policy, collection rates have improved over the \nlast few years. TADAZ recently paid some long outstanding debts and has commitments to \nclear past debts.  \n \n3.  Sector Focus   \n28.  As defined in the country strategy and program update,4 ADB strategy is driven by the \nthree sector goals: (i) utilizing the hydropower export potential; (ii) improving efficiency; and \n(iii) achieving financial sustainability, which will promote new investments in the sector. \n                                                 \n3 Commission\u2019s Report.

Afghanistan Electricity Authority  \n \n1.  The financial statements of the Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) for the period \n2004\u20132005 (based on actual data) and 2006\u20132015 (based on forecasts) are in Table A8.4. As \nDABM does not maintain an audited set of accounts or follow acceptable accounting reporting \nstandards, the results of this analysis needs to be treated with caution. However, the trends in \nthe projections are still useful to appreciate DABM\u2019s future financial situation. The bases and \nassumptions used for the forecast period are described below.   \n \n2.  Inflation and Exchange Rate. Foreign inflation rates are assumed to be 2% and local \ninflation 5% during the forecast period. The local currency is forecast to decline against the \nUS dollar, consistent with purchasing power parity treatment as shown in Table A8.1. \n \nTable A8.1: Exchange Rate \nYear  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nAF/$  50.0  51.4  52.9  54.5  56.1  57.7  59.4  61.2  63.0  64.8 \nSource{s}: **Please list table source/s here. Use Arial 9 pt. font.** \n \n3.  Tariff. Average tariffs are assumed to increase in accordance with the tariff increases \nannounced by the Government which took effect from 23 September 2006. The average real \ntariff forecast is $0.083/kWh for the three main categories of consumers\u2014domestic, commercial \nand government agencies, and nongovernment organizations. The previous average tariff was \n$0.0816/kWh. The tariff is assumed to rise with inflation.   \n \n4.  Sales. With increasing supply of imported electricity, sales are forecast to grow at 5\u20136% \nper annum over the medium term to meet the suppressed demand for electricity.     \n \n5.  Taxes and Duties are assumed to be as follows: income tax rate: 20%; turnover tax: 2% \nof revenues. \n \n6.  Operating Expenses and Taxation. The cost of fuel and cost of purchasing power are \nassumed to grow with increased sales and inflation. To attract and retain quality employees and \nto  improve  the  maintenance  of  assets,  wages  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  are \nassumed  to  increase  by  5%  per  annum  in  real  terms  until  2010  and  at  the  inflation  rate \nthereafter.  \n \n7.  Accounts Receivable are modeled to decline to 3 months of revenue by 2010.   \n \n8.  Fixed Assets are assumed to grow in line with high forecast capital expenditures, in \nparticular because of the effect of the extensive transmission projects being undertaken in \nAfghanistan, including this Project.   \n \n9.  Long-Term Debt includes the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans for this Project and \nnew approved loans. \n \n10.

Average tariffs are assumed to increase in line with the tariff proposal submitted \nby BT to the Ministry of Energy (MOE) and the Anti-Monopoly Commission in September 2006. \nThey are expected to be ratified by parliament in November 2006, soon after the Presidential \nelection on 6 November 2006. The proposed tariff increases are in line with\u2014but about 10% \nlower than\u2014the tariffs proposed by the World Bank. Average tariffs are projected to reach \n7.66 Dirams or $0.021/kWh in 2010 versus the proposed World Bank tariff of 8.6 Dirams/kWh or \n$0.023/kWh. Afterward, the tariff is assumed to rise in line with the projected domestic inflation \nrate of 5.0%.

Rationale \n \n1.  The Project facilitates a higher volume of electricity trade between Afghanistan and \nTajikistan. Afghanistan has one of the lowest per capita energy consumptions in the world, and \nis badly in need of more electricity supply. Tajikistan has surplus electricity during the summer \nmonths when there is excess hydroelectric capacity because of high river flows. Incremental \nelectricity is produced at minimal cost in Tajikistan and will be exported to Afghanistan at a likely \ntariff  of  $0.025  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  while  Afghanistan\u2019s  marginal  cost  of  electricity \ngenerated through diesel firing can be as high as $0.330/kWh. The Project will offer a win-win \nsituation for both countries. \n \n2.  All the components are part of the least-cost expansion program developed under the \npower system master plan. The plan considers transmission supply alternatives to Kabul and \nrelated areas with grid supply and replaces large-scale isolated diesel generation. The Project is \nthe least-cost option for developing a transmission line from Afghanistan to Tajikistan. On an \nincremental basis, the Project will greatly increase power capacity to provide relatively cheap \nand low-cost electricity supply to households and enterprises. Currently, diesel generation costs \n$0.33/kWh. The Project can supply power with an estimated average cost of imported electricity \nof $0.025/kWh at the border. \n \nB.   Financial Analysis \n \n1.   Project Viability Analysis \n3.  The project viability analysis was undertaken on a conservative basis, assuming that the \nexpensive diesel-fired plant in Kabul, which provides a significant incentive for importation by \nAfghanistan, only runs at 50% capacity. While transmission lines have a serviceable life of \n40 years, a project life of only 20 years has been used.  \n \n2.   Afghanistan and Tajikistan Transmission Lines \n \n4.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  has  been  computed  for  the  project \ncomponents from the perspective of the power utilities in each country based on the following \nkey assumptions. \n \n5.  The benefit accruing to Tajikistan from the transmission interconnection line is mainly \nthrough the sale of incremental electricity, assumed at $0.025/kWh, which is in excess of \nTajikistan\u2019s needs during the summer season and hence has no alternative value. The benefit \naccruing to Afghanistan is that the import displaces generation from Kabul\u2019s high cost diesel-\nfired  power  generation  plant  with  an  incremental  cost  of  $0.330/kWh  and  imports  from \nUzbekistan at $0.030/kWh. The additional import from Tajikistan also helps to meet some of the \nunserved  energy  in  Kabul,  which  has  a  rapidly  growing  population  currently  estimated  at \n4 million.  \n \n6.  Other project components include: (i) in Tajikistan, several subprojects whose benefits \naccrue  from  the  prevention  of  major  plant  shutdown  and  plant  capacity  and  efficiency \nimprovements;  and  (ii)  in  Afghanistan,  construction  of  two  new  substations  in  Kunduz \n(population 950,000) and Baglan (population 850,000) that will meet unserved and incremental \ndemand.   \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \n \n7.  The financial analysis shows that the FIRR of the transmission project and the individual \nsubprojects  all  exceed  their  respective  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  both \ncountries. The Project is attractive to both Afghanistan (FIRR 12.4%) and Tajikistan (FIRR \n20.8%), and well exceeds the Project\u2019s WACC for both countries of 0% and 3%, respectively. \nThe analysis, including key assumptions and sensitivity analyses, is summarized in Tables A9.1 \nto A9.4. \n \nC.   Economic Analysis \n \n1.   Assumptions for Economic Cost of Project Components \n \n8.  To convert financial project cost into economic cost, turnover and income taxes were \ndeducted, and capital costs remained with no contingencies in the base capital cost. Annual \noperation  and  maintenance  and  administration  costs  were  calculated  in  economic  prices \n(financial prices adjusted using the standard conversion factor). The cost of supply was valued \nbased on the long-run marginal cost for generation and transmission as calculated in the power \nsector master plan. Consistent with the financial analysis, 20 years is used for the project \neconomic analysis. Investment is assumed to take place during 2007\u20132009 and project benefits \nare assumed to be realized from 2009.  \n \n2.   Quantification of Benefits \n \n9.  The main benefits for Tajikistan are from (i) the transmission line from Tajikistan for the \nlong-term reliable electricity to Afghanistan for summer season, (ii) rehabilitation of existing \nsubstations, and (iii) provision of some metering. Incremental benefits were calculated from \nincreased outputs and exports to Afghanistan. \n \n10.  For Afghanistan, main benefits included (i) increased availability and capacity of power \nsupply for Kabul and Kunduz from the transmission line from Tajikistan, (ii) connection of related \nnorthern areas of Afghanistan, (iii) rehabilitation of Kunduz and Baglan substations, and (iv) \nreplacement of electricity from diesel sources and loss reduction. The incremental benefits were \ncalculated as savings from diesel generation, savings from Uzbekistan imports ($0.03/kWh), \nand incremental sales. Incremental benefits were calculated using customers\u2019 willingness to \npay. \n \n11.  The total demand in Kabul is estimated at 300 megawatt (MW), and the demand on \nelectricity will continue to grow with economic growth. The Project can provide reliable electricity \nto the areas where the transmission line will pass. This will greatly benefit local people with no \naccess to electricity, and privately operated  generators based on diesel or petrol-powered \ngeneration  for  electricity.  Thus,  the  transmission  line  will  benefit  the  whole  economy, \nresidences, the Government, and enterprises with cheap electricity. The economic benefits of \nextending supply to Kunduz and Baglan areas are estimated based on the cost of alternative \nenergy sources used for existing consumption levels, and based on the willingness to pay for \ninduced consumption because of the availability of reliable grid supply.  \n \n12.  Economic analysis revealed that electricity savings in Afghanistan or equivalent savings \nin other forms of energy is approximately $0.33/kWh. The analysis covered the benefits from \nincreased electricity supply that would attract investment in the country and, consequently an \neconomic subsidy to household consumers (below 300 kWh/ for 2 months) and partial subsidies \n(below 700 kwh/ for 2 months) will be covered by the Government\u2019s budget. \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \n3.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n13.  To test the economic viability of the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nwas calculated on the basis of incremental cost-and-benefit streams associated with each \nproject.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  performance  of  the  proposed \ncomponents by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios, i.e., the economic value of \nthe incremental supply of electricity that the components will provide compared with the existing \npatterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n14.  Economic returns are acceptable for the Project and robust for most. This stems from \nincreased transmission capacity to bring reliable power in Tajikistan to mitigate the power \nshortage  in  Afghanistan.  On  average,  the  Project  will  bring  reliable  and  cheap  power  to \nAfghanistan. Considering the current cost of diesel generation of $0.33/kWh, willingness to pay \nwas estimated to be high even with the tariff increase. The viability of the Project was analyzed \nfrom a broader national perspective in terms of the EIRR. The financial costs were adjusted to \nreflect the true economic opportunities forgone and realized on account of the Project. The \neconomic analysis was based on the following additional assumptions: \n \n(i)  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  non-tradable  goods  of  0.9  is  used  for  both \nTajikistan and Afghanistan. \n(ii)  Based on willingness to pay for the transmission line, savings for NW Kabul \ndiesel generation was calculated at border price of $0.0325/kWh; and at border \nprice of $0.030/kWh for the rest of analysis. \n(iii)  The shadow exchange rate is 1.10 for Afghanistan and 1.11 for Tajikistan. \n \n15.  For  Tajikistan,  the  EIRR  of  the  Project  was  31.1%.  The  EIRR  was  15.7%  for  the \nhydropower plant component and 40.1% for the transmission line. For Afghanistan, the EIRR of \nthe  Project  was  calculated  at  31.0%,  with  the  transmission  line  part  of  39.6%  and \nKunduz/Baglan part of 19.8%. \n \n16.  The distribution of economic benefits arising from the Project in Tajikistan and from \nsavings of imported electricity of the Project in Afghanistan was calculated at a discount rate of \n12%. The poverty impact analysis showed that 53% of economic benefits will go to poor people \nliving below the official poverty line in Afghanistan and 54% of economic benefit will go to the \npoor in Tajikistan.    \n \n4.   Sensitivity Analysis \n \n17.  Various financial and economic sensitivity of the project performance to changes in key \nvariables was tested. The FIRR and EIRR values remained robust for all scenarios. This is \nparticularly important for Afghanistan where risks of the Project seem high. The sensitivity \nanalysis reveals that a 1-year delay will bring the FIRR down to 10.6%, from the base case of \n12.4%, and lower the EIRR to 24.5% from a base case of 31.0%. This implies that the delay in \nimplementation will incur economic costs. In addition, political instability and security will also \naffect project implementation. This is particularly important for Afghanistan where project risks \nare high. Although it is difficult to quantify such damage to the Project, political instability and \nsecurity will mostly cause the Project cost increase and implementation delay. The calculation \nresults showed that with 30% of capital cost increase and a 1-year delay, the FIRR was \nacceptable at 7.5% and the EIRR was 19.6%, still above 12%. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  49 \n5.   Regional Cooperation Benefits \n \n18.  Distribution analysis for regional cooperation was conducted to examine the distribution \nof the Project\u2019s benefits for the two countries in the region, using the same EIRR methodology \nand assumptions for discount rate, price numeraire, constant price, and standard conversion \nfactor adjustment. This Project offers the additional regional benefit of increased trade, as it will \npromote trade in electricity and encourage trade from other areas. The net economic benefits of \nregional cooperation from trade are estimated at $114.3 million at 12% of discount rate for both \ncountries.  Tajikistan  should  share  47%  of  benefits  and  Afghanistan  should  share  53%  of \nbenefits from the Project. This is a typical win-win case of regional cooperation. \n \nTable A9.1: AFG: Financial Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \nItem  NPV  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015

Afghanistan \n \n1.  Background \n \n1.  The  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  has  requested  $35  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to undertake the Afghan leg of the Regional Power Transmission \nInterconnection Project (the Project) connecting Shekhanbandar on the Tajikistan border to the \nPul-e-Khumri station via a 147 kilometer (km) 220 kilovolt (kV) transmission line. The Project\u2014\nto be implemented with the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) as executing agency (EA) and \nthe Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) as implementing agency (IA)\u2014will require minimal \nland acquisition and no resettlement. Most of the transmission line (81%) will cross unused \ndesert land; in the remaining tracts, towers will be set on an unused transmission line tower \nbases or poles will be used. The Kunduz station improvement will not require land acquisition \nwhile the Baghlan station expansion will require only 300 square meters (m2). A total of 61 \nfamilies will be affected by the Project (768 individuals). All of them will have some crop affected \nand 16 will permanently lose some land (364 m2 in total). No affected family will be severely \naffected1 or will need rehabilitation.  \n \n2.  To plan the compensation program for these impacts, the EA has prepared a short \nresettlement  plan  (RP) 2  in  accordance  with  Afghanistan  law  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement. The RP provides \nimpacts  figures,  describes  the  compensation/rehabilitation  framework,  and  details  all  RP \nimplementation mechanisms/responsibilities. After detailed design completion, the RP will be \nreviewed and, if necessary, updated as a condition for approval of the civil works contract. RP \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  ADB  requirements  will  be  a  condition  for  civil  works \nmobilization.  \n \n2.  Compensation and Rehabilitation Framework  \n \n3.  The basic compensation/rehabilitation principles are as follows: (i) land acquisition will \nbe avoided or at least minimized; (ii) compensation will ensure the maintenance of the pre-\nproject living standards of affected persons (APs); (iii) APs will be fully informed/consulted on \ncompensation  options;  (iv)  AP  sociocultural  institutions  will  be  supported/used;  (v)  land \nacquisition provisions will apply equally to women and men; (vi) lack of formal title will not be a \nbar  to  compensation/rehabilitation;  (vii)  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  women-headed \nhouseholds and vulnerable groups; (viii) land acquisition will be conceived and executed as an \nintegral part of the Project and land acquisition budgets will be included in project costs; and \n(ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling and demolition.  \n \n4.  The RP also sets the eligibility/entitlement provisions for impacts caused by the Project \n(Table 11.1). \n \n                                                 \n1  Impacts are considered severe if more than 200 affected persons (APs) have to be resettled or suffer more than \n10% income losses. If so, a full resettlement plan (RP) must be prepared. Losses are not severe if less than 200 \nAPs are to be resettled or suffer >10% income losses. If so, only a short RP must be prepared. Based on ADB. \nOperations Manual Section F2/OP & BP (2003). \n2  Based on the benchmarks for impact significance (footnote 1), and given the number of APs and type of impacts \nthey suffer, this Project will not cause severe losses so only a short RP was prepared.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.1: Entitlements Matrix (Afghanistan) \nAsset  Specification  Affected Persons  Compensation Entitlements \nPermanent Land Newly acquired land   Holders of titles, land-use  Cash replacement  free of taxes, registration, \nAcquisition     certificate, customary rights,  and transfer costs\u2014except for squatters who \n  squatters  are given rehabilitation in the form of \n  compensation for one additional crop \n \nLand acquired before  Same  No compensation for land; only for crops \n(old tower base, \nleases) \nTemporary Land    Same  Rent/plot rehabilitation equal to one tenthof land\nOccupation   value.  \nTenants to share the lump sum with land use \ncertificate holders in accordance with their \ncontract \nCrops  Crops affected  All affected persons  One crop compensation in cash at full market \nincluding holders of land use  rate for one harvest by default for impacts \ncertificate, customary rights  caused by tower/poles bases plus crop \nholders, tenants, and  compensation for crop damages occurring \nsquatters  during construction (on a default area of 50 m2). \nTenants use rights holders will share \ncompensation based on their contract. \nCommunal       Rehabilitation/substitution of the affected \nAssets  structures \nOther entitlements (in case  applicable after RP review) \nHouses/  All house structures  Owners  Replacement rate compensation based on new \nStructures  materials, labor, and transport cost, free from \ndepreciation, transaction costs salvaged \nmaterials for whole affected item/section of it. \nTrees  All trees under the line  Owners  Fruit trees compensated in cash based on net \nmarket income of one harvest for the number of \nyears needed to regrow the tree at the same \nproductive level of tree lost.

RP Implementation Mechanisms and Responsibilities \n \n5.  Institutional Responsibilities. In view of the minimal and geographically circumscribed \nimpacts caused by the Project, the RP organization will be very simple. MEW will have overall \nresponsibility for RP preparation, implementation, and financing and will exercise its functions at \nlocal level through DABM offices. A project implementation unit (PIU) under MEW is tasked with \ngeneral project execution tasks. At the PIUs, RP tasks will be handled by an RP team which will \nkeep close communication with affected families, local DABM offices, and local governments. \nThe RP officer will be closely assisted by the resettlement team of the project implementation \nconsultants which will plan and execute all post-detailed design surveys and, if necessary, \nupdate the RP. The consultants will also assist the RP officer in organizing and implementing \nthe delivery of compensation/rehabilitation provisions. \n  \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \n6.  Disclosure/Public  Consultation.  The  RP  has  been  prepared  based  on  repeated \nconsultation with the affected families. As an appraisal condition, The RP in English will be \ndisclosed on the ADB website while the RP in Dari will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities. \n \n7.  Grievance  Procedures.  APs will first lodge a complaint with local MEW offices in \nKunduz or Pul-e-Khumri. If no settlement is reached within 14 days, the complaint will be lodged \nto the PIU. If the grievance remains unsettled, APs may then seek redress at the appropriate \ncourt.    \n \n8.   Monitoring. The PIUs will internally monitor and report to the EA on land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR) implementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly.  \n \n9.  Finances and Schedules. As indicated in the RP, the compensation and rehabilitation \nprogram for the Project is $6,286, including 15% contingency. \n \n4.  Indigenous Peoples Issues    \n \n10.  The Project will not affect people that may be classified as indigenous under The Bank\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Although affected families may belong to different ethnic \ngroups, essentially Pashtun or Tajik, all of them fully participate in local political and economic \nlife in project areas, and are involved on equal terms in mainstream Afghan culture and society \nwhich is multiethnic.  \n \nB.  Tajikistan \n \n1.  Background \n   \n11.  The Government of Tajikistan has requested $21.5 million from ADB to undertake the \nTajikistan leg of the Project, connecting Sangtuda Hydropower Plant with the Afghan border via \na 118 km 220 kV transmission line. The Project, to be implemented with Barki Tajik (BT) as the \nEA, will require minimal land acquisition and cause no resettlement as most of the transmission \nline will cross unused desert land. In total, there will be 22 affected families (176 individuals) and \none collective enterprise. They will lose about 1,423 m2 of land permanently and 1,450 m2 \ntemporarily during construction. All of them will also lose some crops.  \n \n12.  To plan the compensation program for these impacts, the EA has prepared an RP3 in \naccordance with Tajikistan law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement and Operations Manual F2 \non Involuntary Resettlement. The RP provides impact figures, describes the compensation/ \nrehabilitation framework, and details all RP implementation mechanisms/responsibilities. After \ndetailed design completion, the RP will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated as a condition \nfor  approval  of  the  civil  works  contract.  RP  implementation  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements will be a condition to civil works mobilization.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Based on the ADB Operations Manual (OM) Section F2/OP & BP (2003), the content/complexity of an RP varies \ndepending on the degree of impact severity of a project. When impacts are severe (more than 200 APs to be \nresettled or suffering more than 10% income losses), a full RP will be prepared. When losses are not severe (less \nthan 200 APs to be resettled or suffering >10% income losses), only a short RP will have to be prepared. Given the \nnumber of APs and the type of impacts they suffer, the Project will not cause severe losses, therefore only a small \nRP has been prepared.  \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n2.  Compensation and Rehabilitation Framework  \n13.  The basic compensation/rehabilitation principles are as follows: (i) land acquisition will \nbe avoided or at least minimized; (ii) compensation will ensure the maintenance of APs\u2019 pre-\nproject living standards; (iii) APs will be fully informed/consulted on compensation options; \n(iv) AP sociocultural institutions will be supported and used; (v) LAR provisions will apply equally \nto women and men; (vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to compensation/rehabilitation; \n(vii) particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  women-headed  households  and  vulnerable  groups; \n(viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the Project and LAR budgets will \nbe included in project costs; and (ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling \nand demolition.  \n14.  The  RP  also  sets  detailed  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  (Table  11.2)  for  assets \naffected by the Project. \n \nTable A11.2: Entitlements Matrix (Tajikistan) \nAsset   Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nTemporary    Holders of land use  Lump sum rent for occupation.

At the PIUs, RP tasks will be handled by BT environment and resettlement \nteam  which  will  collaborate  with  BT  district  offices  and  district  governments  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  compensation/rehabilitation  program  at  local  level.  The  project \nimplementation consultants will assist the environment and resettlement officer in organizing \nand implementing the delivery of compensation/rehabilitation provisions. \n  \n16.  Disclosure/Public  Consultation.  The  RP  has  been  prepared  based  on  repeated \nconsultation with the affected families. As an appraisal condition, the RP in English will be \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  while  the  RP  in  Russian  will  be  disclosed  in  the  APs\u2019 \ncommunities.  An  information  pamphlet  briefly  describing  the  Project,  its  compensation \nrehabilitation entitlements, and main implementation dates in Russian will be sent to all affected \nfamilies. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  59 \n17.  Grievance Procedures. APs will first lodge a complaint with the District BT office. If \nsettlement  is  not  reached  within  14  days,  the  complaint  will  then  be  lodged  to  the  BT \nenvironmental and resettlement team at the PIU. If the grievance is still not settled, the APs may \nseek redress at the appropriate court.  \n   \n18.  Monitoring.  The  PMUs  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  LAR \nimplementation on a monthly basis. The EA will report to ADB each quarter.  \n \n19.  Finances and Schedules. As indicated in the RP, the cost of the compensation and \nrehabilitation program for the Project, including 15% contingency, is TJS43,473 ($12,786).  \n \n4.  Indigenous Peoples Issues    \n \n20.  The Project will not affect people that may be classified as indigenous under The Bank\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous People. Ethnically, the affected families are either Tajik or Uzbek.

The rural poor in \nTajikistan will enjoy improved irrigation/water supply in agricultural production in summer and to a lesser \ndegree in winter. Greater year-round access to electricity both in Afghanistan and Tajikistan will also \nindirectly benefit poor and vulnerable consumers by allowing more efficient operations to hospitals, \nschools, and other social utilities, which are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply and quality. \nImproved power supplies will also encourage light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment \nopportunities, and improving productivity and the quality of outputs in the manufacturing and agriculture \nsectors. Such developments will trickle down with beneficial effects on the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan are the poorest countries in the region, with poverty incidence of 70% and 61%, \nrespectively. Electricity is an input to most economic processes so it is essential for poverty alleviation. \nProvision of electricity for Afghanistan and Tajikistan is one of the key tasks for both countries. The \nproposed Project will build a transmission line from Tajikistan to provide 300 megawatt (MW) of electricity \nto  Afghanistan  to  reduce  electricity  shortage.  Although  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction  cannot  be \nquantified, the low cost of power supply will benefit poor consumers in Afghanistan and the income of \nelectricity supply will benefit the poor in Tajikistan. The low electricity cost from the transmission line can \nexpand electricity consumption to the poor in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Both governments will also \nprovide some lifeline subsidies to poor people. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?

The  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  designed  to  improve  the  capacity  of  Afghanistan \nElectricity Authority (DABM)\u2014a power company owned by the Government of Afghanistan with \n5,583  employees.  DABM  maintains  and  operates  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution facilities in Afghanistan. It depends heavily on government and donor support to \nfund its operational and capital expenditure programs. Until 2005, even salaries of DABM staff \nwere  paid  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  budget.  Improving  institutional, \ntechnical, and financial capacity of DABM is necessary if the Project is to be implemented by \nDABM.  Two  key  areas  would  improve  DABM\u2019s  overall  performance:  (i)  strengthening \ninstitutional and management capacity to meet operational demand, and (ii) improving and \nexpanding capacity for technical employees of DABM. \nB.  Activities \n \n2.

Objective \n \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  designed  to  strengthen  and  improve  the  internal \nmanagement and customer responsiveness and reliability of Barki Tajik (BT), a public-owned \npower  company  in  Tajikistan.  During  the  past  5  years  BT\u2019s  management  and  institutional \ncapacity have improved but its services are still poor and inefficient. Current technical losses are \nassessed to be around 16% and nontechnical losses about 14%. The company is run by a \nchairperson without the control of a board of directors, the decision making process is not \ntransparent, and there are no external controls. The Government of Tajikistan (the Government) \nplans to restructure and unbundle the company starting in 2008. Although unbundling is a long-\nterm solution and target for BT as designed under the Power Rehabilitation Project,1 in the \nshort- term, BT must establish an efficient management and rational institutional structure to \neffectively design and control the planning, budgeting, revenue management, and corporate \naccounting system. One way to achieve immediate results in terms of efficiency and proper \nmanagement structure is through a 3\u20135 year performance-based management contract or other \nform of contracts. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n2.  An international consulting firm will be recruited to undertake the following activities:  \n \n(i)  conducting an audit (managerial, financial, commercial, and technical) of BT and \nof the power sector in Tajikistan; \n(ii)  by  benchmarking  against  similar  projects  around  the  world,  define  the  most \nappropriate scheme (service contract, management contract, lease, etc.) that \nbest suits the objectives of the Government and local environment in Tajikistan; \n(iii)  organizing  a  study  tour  or  inviting  resource  persons  from  relevant  countries \nwhere  performance  based  management  contracts  have  been  implemented \nsuccessfully; \n(iv)  preparing and conducting training programs as needed on the various forms of \nprivate sector participation, showing the advantages and disadvantages, short- \nand  long-term  benefits  for  the  country/power  utility,  different  modes  of \ncontracting, etc.;    \n(v)  assessing  the  potential  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  performance  based \nmanagement contracts n Tajikistan; \n(vi)  proposing a structure to the Government regarding the corporate governance of \nBT, including the formation of board of directors for BT and the preparation of a \nboard of directors\u2019 code of conduct, terms of reference, fiduciary duties, and \nrelated function rules; \n(vii)  developing a website for BT to advertise information on the company, project and \nongoing procurement, technical and financial results, etc.; \n(viii)  defining jointly with the Government the performance criteria that will apply to the \nmanagement contract, and fixing realistic and achievable targets;  \n(ix)  specifying  clear  targets  about  system  performance  to  be  achieved  over  the \ncontract; \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

Background Information \n1.  The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) manages controls and operates the power \nsector of Afghanistan through eight departments and four state-owned enterprises, of which the \nlargest is Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM). \n \n2.  Overall, capacity in the power sector to carry out core accountability functions is weak, \nboth at MEW and DABM. This is particularly evident in the implementation by MEW of major \ncapital  investments  that  are  being  made  in  the  sector,  and  in  specific  areas  such  as \nprocurement, technical, and financial management.  \n \n3.  To date, MEW has been assisted by the project support implementation unit financed by \nthe Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to cope with the technical, procurement, and \nfinancial management of ongoing projects. Since September 2006, the services of the project \nsupport implementation unit have been discontinued. The senior advisor to MOE has been also \ntransferred to the Ministry of Economy. The project implementation unit (PIU) within MOE relies \nonly on the assistance of a single project implementation consultant financed by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), whose services will end on 31 December 2006. \n \n4.  As  in  other  sectors,  low  civil  service  wages  are  not  sufficient  to  attract  younger \nprofessional staff who can replace the ageing workforce which has technically outdated skills.  \n \n5.  The capacity of MEW for preparing the budget and overseeing public spending in the \nsector  is  weak.  MEW  also  has  weak  planning  capability\u2014all  MEW  projects  have  equal \nimportance and it has enormous difficulties prioritizing them. \n \n6.  MEW has a procurement unit which requires considerable strengthening both in terms of \ntechnical (engineering) capacity and in procurement principles and practices. \n \n7.  MEW  is  fully  committed  by  its  project  administration  task  and  does  not  have  the \nresources to work on its own mandate\u2014to dictate the policy of the sector, including necessary \ntariff increases, power utility reporting, and restructuring of DABM. \n \n8.  To address the above issues, it is proposed to (i) strengthen MEW with support from an \ninternational consultant who will secure this new capital investment, (ii) assist MEW in the \nsupervision of ongoing projects, and (iii) reinforce the existing PIU. \n \nB.  Description of the Services \n9.  The  consultants  will  assist  MEW  in  (i)  project  administration  of  the  ADB  projects \n(ongoing and new); (ii) setting up and updating the project accounting system; (iii) providing \nadvice to MEW in terms of project management and reporting to ADB; and (iv) technical matters \nincluding but not limited to procurement. \n \n10.  The consultants will provide training to MEW staff in procurement issues; financial and \naccounting systems; and environmental, resettlement, social and poverty issues. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  69 \n11.  The  consultant  will  provide  advice  to  MEW  in  terms  of planning  development  of  a \nstrategy for the power sector; tariffs; and other issues such as reduction of technical and \nnontechnical losses, negotiation and implementation of power purchase agreements, reporting \nfrom power utility, budgeting, etc. \n \nC.  Expertise Required \n \n12.  A total of 50 person-months of international consulting services will be required. These \ninclude the following: \n \n(i)  Senior advisor to the minister  (24 person-months) \n(ii)  Senior advisor to the PIU/capacity building (24 person-months) \n  (iii)  Financial analyst (2 person-months) \n \nD.  Duration of the Services and Reporting Requirements \n \n13.  The duration of the services will be about 24 months. The consultants will prepare an \ninception report within 1 month after the commencement date, monthly reports during the \nduration of the services, and a completion report. \n \nE.  Costs \n \n14.
