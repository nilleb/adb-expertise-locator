Jawa Satu Power for the development of the Jawa-1 Liquefied Natural \nGas-to-Power Project in Indonesia. The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan  of  up  to  $150,000,000  to  be  provided  by  the  Leading  Asia\u2019s  Private  Infrastructure  Fund1 \n(LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan. \n \n2. \nUnder  the  proposed  project,  PT.  Jawa  Satu  Power  will  build,  operate,  and  maintain  a \ncombined-cycle,  gas-fired  power  plant  with  a  nominal  capacity  of  1,760  megawatts  (MW)  in \nCilamaya, Karawang, West Jawa. The loans will support the development of one of the first and \nlargest power projects using liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Indonesia, testifying to the commitment \nof the Government of Indonesia to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on coal while using cleaner \ndomestic  energy  sources. The  project  will  also  provide  an  affordable  power  generation  source \nthat could increase the penetration capacity of renewable energy sources on the Jawa\u2013Bali grid. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nIndonesia  is  the  largest  economy  in  Southeast  Asia,  with  a  gross  domestic  product  of \n$1 trillion in 2017. Economic growth has averaged 5.0% from 2015 to 2017, but stronger growth \nis  needed  to  drive  poverty  down  to  a  single  digit  and  reverse  the  situation  of  high  inequality.2 \nGrowth  remains  below  potential  because  of  structural  impediments  such  as  deficient  energy \ninfrastructure.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  Indonesia\u2019s  infrastructure \ninvestment needs at $1.1 trillion for 2016\u20132030, or $1.3 trillion if climate adaptation measures are \nincluded.3 Accelerating investment in affordable and sustainable energy is critical for achieving \nthe country\u2019s economic and social development goals. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MEMR)  anticipates  power  demand  to \n4. \nexceed current forecasts, resulting in a shortage that could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable \ngrowth  potential  if  not  addressed  adequately.  Every  year,  MEMR  issues  a  rolling  10-year  plan \nprepared by Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the national electric utility, to prioritize new power \ninvestments.  The  National  Electricity  Business  Plan\u2014or  Rencana  Umum  Penyediaan  Tenaga \nListrik (RUPTL), as it is known in Bahasa Indonesia\u2014for 2018\u201320274 indicates that, during this \nperiod, 56 gigawatts (GW) will be added to PLN\u2019s network.5  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is the financing partner.  \n2  The proportion of people living in poverty has declined by more than half, from 24% in 1999 to 10.1% in 2017, but \n\nremains high for a lower middle-income country. \n\n3  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia's Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n4  Government of Indonesia, MEMR. 2018. Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2018\u20132027. Jakarta. \n5  In  the  RUPTL  for  2018\u20132027,  power  demand  was  revised  downward  from  2015\u20132017  levels  because  economic \ngrowth  was  lower  than  expected.  However,  the  required  overall  power  capacity,  including  an  adequate  reserve \nmargin, still exceeds the existing capacity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nSupporting sustainable growth. The RUPTL 2018\u20132027 stresses an increased use of \n5. \nLNG as a source of fuel.6 It anticipates LNG as a share of total natural gas to increase from 33% \nin 2018 to almost 60% in 2027. The use of combined-cycle7 gas-fired generation can improve the \nenvironmental sustainability of the current energy mix by displacing diesel and coal as fuels for \nelectricity generation. Gas turbines can ramp up more quickly than coal or diesel units, and thus \nare better suited to respond rapidly to load fluctuations. In turn, this can enable greater use of \nintermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Therefore, the increase in the use \nof  natural  gas  will  help  the  government  reach  the  target  of  23%  for  power  generation  from \nrenewable energy sources. \n \n6. \nIncreasing power affordability. The Jawa-1 LNG-to-power project will also help lower \nthe  average  power  generation  cost  in  Indonesia\u2019s  largest  power  grid.  From  2015  to  2017,  the \ngovernment has attempted to reduce the cost of electricity. The MEMR issued new regulations in \nJanuary 2017 to set energy tariffs against the local and national grid price.8 The cost of power \ngeneration  (commonly  referred  to  as  BPP,  which  is  short  for  Biaya  Pokok  Pembangkitan)  is \ndetermined by the MEMR every year.9  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n7. \nThe  project  entails  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  a  1,760-MW  load-\nfollowing,  combined-cycle,  gas  turbine  (CCGT)  power  plant  about  100  kilometers  (km)  east  of \nJakarta on the Javanese coastline. PLN is responsible for sourcing the LNG The project will be \nimplemented under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with PLN.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower and Sponsors \n\n \n8. \nThe project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), PT. Jawa Satu \nPower (the borrower). The SPV is owned by reputable sponsors: (i) a major Japanese trading \nhouse, Marubeni Corporation,; (ii) Sojitz Corporation, also a large Japanese trading house; and \n(iii)  PT.  Pertamina  (Persero),  an  integrated  national  oil,  gas,  and  geothermal  company,  wholly \nowned by the Government of Indonesia.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9. \nborrower and related entities.  \n \n\nIntegrity due diligence10 and enhanced tax due diligence11 have been conducted on the \n\n                                                 \n6  Of this new capacity, 57% is expected to be developed by independent power producers (IPPs).

The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam \nturbine, which generates extra power. \n\n8  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  While the tariff ceilings apply to new and renewable energy, the BPP provides an indication of the average price of \nPLN\u2019s grid. Regulation No. 50 imposed caps on tariffs based on PLN\u2019s cost of generation. If the cost of generation \nin the area is less or equal to the national average (as is the case for Java, Sumatra, and Bali), the local area cost of \ngeneration applies as cap. \n\n10  ADB. 2003.

The  project  will  contribute  to  reestablish  Indonesia\u2019s  energy  independence  by \nredirecting energy resources from export markets to the domestic market. Over time Indonesia is \ntransitioning from an export economy into one based on domestic consumption. \n \n11. \nOutcome.  The  project  outcome  is:  an  increase  in  power  generated  from  local  energy \nsources. The project will generate 9,400 gigawatt-hours of energy annually and 120 local jobs \nduring operations, of which at least 15 will be for women.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nOutputs. The project outputs are: (i) the installation of a 1,760 MW combined cycle gas-\n12. \nfired  power  plant  and  ancillary  infrastructure;  (ii)  the  generation  of  local  employment  with  the \ncreation of at least 4,000 jobs during construction, of which at least 240 will be for women; and \n(iii) support of local economic growth through domestic purchases during construction. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  private \nsector  participation  in  infrastructure,  a  core  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategy  as  affirmed  by \nStrategy 2030.12 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132019 \nfor Indonesia in supporting the expansion of infrastructure and environment-friendly technologies \nfor clean energy generation.13 It also contributes to the objectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy \nPlan.14 \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,15 which states that support for power infrastructure using \nLNG is to be broadened. The project fully aligns with ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy for Indonesia, \nwhich aims at strengthening the reach, reliability, and efficiency of the nation\u2019s electricity grid; and \nenabling greater use of clean energy. It also complements recent ADB assistance programs to \nthe  MEMR  and  PLN  for  policy-based  lending  and  direct  investments.16 The  project  builds  on \nADB\u2019s private sector experience and recent support to the LNG industry (footnote 12). \n \n15. \nADB  is  also  the  partner of  choice for Indonesia\u2019s  strategy  to finance  low-carbon  power \ngeneration  through  private  sector  participation.  ADB  is  supporting  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to \nstrengthen  the  LNG  supply  chain,  and  to  increase  energy  independence,  while  contributing  to \nreduce power generation costs. ADB\u2019s contribution in support of the private sector in Indonesia\u2019s \nnatural  gas  value  chain  dates  back  to  2005,  when  ADB  provided  a  $350  million  loan  for  the \ngreenfield development of Tangguh LNG.17 In 2016, ADB financed the expansion of the Tangguh \n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2018.

Tower design, placement, and height minimize noise, \nelectric  magnetic  fields,  health  and  safety  risks,  and  other  environmental  impacts  as  much  as \npossible. \n \n21. \nThe  project  will  use  natural  gas  as  fuel.  The  main  air  pollutant  of  potential  concern  is \nnitrogen dioxide (NO2). The baseline level of NO2 indicates that the airshed is non-degraded. Air \ndispersion  modeling  for  operation  of  the  plant  shows  that  NO2  emissions  will  comply  with \nIndonesian air quality standards and World Health Organization guidelines.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n22. \nThe  Java  Sea  has  degraded  water  quality.  The  project  area  has  few  sensitive  marine \nspecies  and  does  not  support  coral  or  sea  grass.  Seawater  will  be  used  for  all  water  needs, \nincluding closed-loop cooling. Wastewater will be treated on site, and discharges will comply with \nIFC  and  Indonesian  marine  water  guidelines.  Modeling  confirms  that,  after  mixing,  changes  in \ntemperature and salinity are within the range of natural variation at the site. Dredging volumes for \nthe jetty  and  pipeline  will  be  45,981  m3,  less than  the  originally  proposed  80,000 m3.  Dredged \nmaterials are to be disposed on the seabed adjacent to the works area. The impact on fisherfolks \nand potential risks were considered as part of the ESIA. \n \n23. \nAmbient noise levels are above IFC residential criteria. Noise modelling for construction \nindicates  localized  exceedances  in  noise  standards,  therefore  the  sponsor  has  agreed  to \nimplement mitigation measures. This includes pre-boring of piles, use of dampers when impact \npiling, restricting noisy work to daytime hours and installation of a noise wall. Noise modeling was \nconducted  for  the  operation  phase,  which  predicts  that  elevated  noise  levels  comply  with  IFC \nguidelines and do not result in perceptible increases of more than 3 A-weighted decibels (dBA). \n \n24. \nStakeholder consultation was undertaken during the local environmental approval process \nand  during  the  preparation  of  the  ESIA.  A  community  grievance  redress  mechanism  was \ndeveloped and socialized. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n25. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project will require the acquisition of land for the power \nplant, onshore pipeline, jetty, pumphouse, transmission line tower footings, and the substation,. \nThe land will be acquired through negotiation of voluntary sales (willing buyer\u2013willing seller). In \naddition, land below the transmission line will be subject to land use restriction. \n \nThe transmission line tower footings and the substation  were acquired between 2017 and \n26. \n2018  on  a  purely  willing  seller\u2013willing  buyer  basis,.  All  the    landowners  have  received  at  least \n80% of the compensation, while the remaining 20% will be paid when the land transfer is formally \ncompleted. The transmission line\u2019s right of way will impose land use restriction, such as maximum \nheight  of  trees  and  structures.  As  the  transmission  line  footings  positions  have  been  defined, \npeople under the transmission line alignment will not have a choice to refuse. The land for the \npower plant, which is currently vacant, will be acquired from Pertamina Gas (Pertagas) through \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ntransfer of land ownership. Pertagas, as part of its corporate social responsibility program, had \ngiven permission for people to temporarily cultivate the land. The program activity formally ended \nin November 2016. The vacant land is used for the time being as a goat grazing area by random \ngoat owners from different villages. \n \n27. \nThe land for the onshore pipeline and access road will be partly acquired and partly leased. \nThe area is being used for paddy and fishponds. The land belongs to the Ministry of Environment \nand  Forestry  and  is  categorized  as  a  protected  forest.  However,  the  surrounding  communities \nhave cultivated the land for years, and some of them already obtained proof of ownership from \nthe National Land Agency and from village authority. These landowners will still be receiving their \ncompensation for the land. Land may also be leased for temporary use as laydown area during \nthe  construction  of  the  transmission  line,  onshore  pipeline,  and  access  road,  if  the  already \nacquired land is not sufficient.  \n \nThe borrower has prepared a resettlement plan (RP)23 to guide the negotiations for land \n28. \nacquisition through a willing seller-willing buyer approach and the negotiated settlement for the \ntransmission line right of way. The RP also includes a livelihood restoration program for vulnerable \naffected land owners. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29. \nIndigenous  people.  No  recognized  indigenous  peoples  reside  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nproposed  project  sites  in  West  Java.  Java  island  dwellers  are  the  largest  ethnic  group  in \nIndonesia. Most of the landowners and people in the Karawang area, including Cilamaya, belong \nto  the  Sundanese  ethnic  group  or  a  mixture  of  Sundanese  and  Javanese,  while  those  in  the \nBekasi area are Sundanese and Betawi. These people do not display a collective attachment to \nthe area. All groups speak their distinct local language but also communicate smoothly in Bahasa \nIndonesia  for  their  day-to-day  interaction.  None  of  these  ethnic  groups  has  experienced \ndiscrimination based on their ethnic identity. \n \n30. \nSome  gender  elements.  The  borrower  commits  to  implement  measures  to  promote \nopportunities for women empowerment in their activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment (1998). The project endeavors to (i) employ at least 240 women during construction; \n(ii)  employ  at  least  15  women  during  operations;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  at  least  40%  of  those \nparticipating  in  and  benefiting  from  training  on  livelihood  and  skills  development  are  women, \namong others. The borrower will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures \nto ADB as part of their environmental and social monitoring reports. \n \n31. \nPT. Jawa Satu Power will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor  standards.24 The  borrower  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  their  and  their  contractors\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will follow ADB requirements.25 \n \n\n                                                 \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2003.
