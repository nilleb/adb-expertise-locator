I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Urban Infrastructure Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Bhutan\u2019s efforts toward sustainable urban \ndevelopment in its two largest municipalities (Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and two emerging \nurban centers (Samdrup Jongkhar Municipality [SJM] and Nganglam Town). It will have four \noutputs:  (i)  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  expansion, \n(ii) mobility improvement, (iii) urban management strengthening, and (iv) project management \nand capacity development.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Unprecedented urban growth3 coupled with inadequate urban infrastructure has resulted \nin a shortfall of basic urban services for Bhutan\u2019s urban residents. Infrastructure requirements \nacross urban centers vary, but access to water, sanitation, solid waste management, and urban \ntransport are often inadequate. The government\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan identifies the need to \ninvest in urban infrastructure and management in Bhutan\u2019s two major municipalities\u2014Thimphu \nand Phuentsholing\u2014and other larger urban centers4 to ensure sustainable urban management. \n \n4.  Thimphu Municipality is Bhutan\u2019s capital, with a population of 92,0005 making up 40% of \nBhutan\u2019s  urban  population.  This  population  is  expected  to  double  by  2025. 6 Thimphu\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategy7 identifies  four  primary  issues  in  the  infrastructure  and  environment \nsector: (i) water supply, (ii) wastewater collection and treatment, (iii) drainage and flooding, and \n(iv) solid waste collection and disposal. The ongoing Urban Infrastructure Development Project \n(UIDP)8 supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) covers water supply, solid waste \nmanagement, and wastewater collection. The UIDP and Thimphu\u2019s local area plan identifies \nwastewater management as a priority issue in Thimphu, with water pollution from wastewater \ndischarge,9 solid  waste,  and  effluent  from  workshops  and  industries  degrading  the  urban \nenvironment.10 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA).

Manila. \n3  Bhutan\u2019s urban population comprises 31% of the total population; by 2020, more than 50% of the population is \nexpected to be living in urban areas (ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy Midterm Review: Bhutan, 2006\u2013\n2010. Manila). \n4  This includes the four municipalities that are autonomous and are now responsible for the provision of all municipal \nservices (Gelephu, Phuentsholing, SJM, and Thimphu) and five regional growth centers, one of which is the \nNganglam Dunghkha Administration. \n5  Based on the 2005 census population of 79,185 and 2.5% growth rate. \n6  Government of Bhutan. 2003.

Manila. \n9  Wastewater from central and southern Thimphu is conveyed to its sole wastewater treatment plant in Babesa, a \nfacultative  lagoon  system,  with  a  design  capacity  of  only  1.75  million  liters per  day  (MLD).  No  additional \nconnections have been allowed since 2010 to prevent overloading of the treatment plant. South Thimphu and \nsections of the core city with laterals produces 6 MLD of wastewater.  \n10 Government of Bhutan. 2007. Bhutan Millennium Development Goals Needs Assessment and Costing Report. \nThimphu. ", "2 \n5.  Following Thimphu Municipality, Phuentsholing Municipality is the second largest urban \ncenter in Bhutan. The 2005 urban population of 20,537 is expected to increase to 31,996 by \n2025.11 It is the busiest commercial hub where most of the country\u2019s cross-border trade takes \nplace. Its urban development plan12 identifies congestion and poor urban mobility as a key issue \nthat restricts the municipality\u2019s growth. There is only one entry and exit point for the core area, \nwhich results in traffic congestion from local traffic and trucks transporting goods to and from \nThimphu, and containers carrying raw materials and finished goods to and from the Pasakha \nindustrial area. Bypass roads and bridges are required to divert traffic and reduce congestion, \nprovide an alternative crossing over the Om Chu River to connect the eastern and western \nportions of the municipality, and accommodate the expected traffic from the proposed dry port. \nIn addition, to avoid border traffic passing through the core area, a second border gate is \nproposed that will link directly to the proposed bypass road.13 The UIDP has contributed to \nrehabilitating and improving roads and other municipal services in Phuentsholing. \n \n6.  SJM  has  recently14 been  designated  the  fourth  municipality  of  Bhutan.  The  urban \npopulation of 5,952 in 2005 is expected to almost triple by 2025. In addition, the satellite town of \nDeothang with a current population of about 2,000 was subsumed under SJM when it was \ndesignated a municipality. While the municipality serves as the gateway to six districts of \neastern  Bhutan  and  is  one  of  the  oldest  urban  areas,  there  has  been  considerably  less \ninvestment  in  urban  infrastructure  compared  with  the  other  three  municipalities  (Gelephu, \nPhuentsholing, and Thimphu). This burdens existing infrastructure in an area that is rapidly \nexpanding and has large growth potential as a trade node with the development of the Asian \nHighways Project and the proposed east\u2013west transnational highway. Structure and local area \nplans15 identify the need to improve road infrastructure, which is unplanned; water supply, which \nhas insufficient capacity to meet current demands, lacks treatment, is of poor quality, and does \nnot meet potable standards; water distribution, which is badly deteriorated with high leakage; \nsanitation, which is currently restricted to on-site facilities not properly maintained; and drainage, \nwhich is primarily an open drain system.  A study16 commissioned by the government shows \nthat, based on projected water demand of 3.7 million liters per day (MLD), current sources of \n1.1 MLD will not be sufficient. A comparison of supply and consumption of water suggests \nnonrevenue water was over 50% in July 2011.17 \n \n7.

A hydroelectric plant (1,800 megawatts) is also planned 40 kilometers away from Nganglam. The new \nsecond east\u2013west transnational highway and Gyalposhig\u2013Nganglam national highway, both under construction, \nwill connect Nganglam to other towns of Bhutan. \n ", "3 \nhas not adequately invested in urban infrastructure. Nganglam\u2019s investment plan20 identifies \nurban expansion to the planned Rinchenthang town with water supply and urban transport as \npriority urban infrastructure needs. Infrastructure investments in Bhutan\u2019s urban areas need to \nbe preceded by further planning and detailed design. \n \n8.  The project is consistent with government plans and strategies, and with the inclusive \nsocial development objective of ADB\u2019s Bhutan country partnership strategy,21 which aims to \nimprove urban infrastructure services, upgrade city planning, and strengthen the planning and \nmanagement  functions  of  municipalities.  It  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  202022 as  it \ncontributes  to  regional  outcomes  in  terms  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  7;  Bhutan\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  specifically  urban  infrastructure,  which  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  five  core  areas  of \nspecialization; and environmentally sustainable development. Lessons learned from past and \nongoing urban projects and the country assistance program evaluation23 are incorporated in the \nproject. These include: (i) expanded assistance for integrated urban development in key urban \ncenters; (ii) continued involvement in the sector as key to capacity building of municipalities and \nfor meeting municipal service requirements of rapidly growing populations; (iii) the ability of local \ngovernments to plan budgets, manage operation and maintenance (O&M), and deal with private \nsector service providers requires considerable strengthening and technical capacity building; \nand (iv) local governments have low revenue bases and struggle to provide basic O&M, thus \nrequiring gradual introduction of cost-reflective utility tariffs and user fees. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  project  is  sustainable  access  to  urban  services  in  Chukha, \nPemagatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Thimphu districts (dzongkhags). The expected outcome \nis that Phuentsholing, SJM, and Thimphu municipalities (thromde), and Nganglam Town (throm) \nwill provide improved urban infrastructure to its residents. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  To achieve outcomes, the project will have four outputs. Output 1: WSS infrastructure \nrehabilitation and expansion will (i) rehabilitate the existing water supply system24 in SJM, and \n(ii) construct a wastewater treatment plant in Thimphu Municipality. This output will include \nprovision of access and connections for WSS to public primary and secondary schools within \nWSS service areas improved or constructed through the project. Output 1 will ensure major \ninfrastructure is properly operated and maintained through provision of required equipment,25 \nand  outsourcing  of  O&M  through  design\u2013build\u2013operate  contracts.  Output  2:  mobility \nimprovement will construct a bridge and road access in Phuentsholing and resurface sections of \nassociated existing roads. This output includes provision of road maintenance equipment for \nproper O&M. Output 3: urban management strengthening will include (i) urban planning through \n                                                \n20 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services. 2010. \nSocio-Economic Environment and Investment Plan.

Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $23.38 million (Table 1). \n \n12.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR12,727,000  from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n13.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).30 The procurement for goods, works, or services \n(other than consulting services) will be done in compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement of consulting services will be done in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Additional financing for urban infrastructure may be considered to scale up the project if it \nperforms well. The project will identify urban infrastructure requirements through the urban \nmanagement strengthening output. On the basis of urban infrastructure requirements identified, \ndue diligence (including safeguards) and detailed design will be undertaken as part of the \nproject. This will achieve readiness for possible additional financing. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  The major component under the project is the new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) \nin Thimphu Municipality. The existing lagoon facility, with an area of 4.9 hectares, was an \nappropriate low technology solution31 when constructed in 1992. However, because of rapid \npopulation growth, it is now treating only about 17% (1.75 MLD) of wastewater generated. To \ntreat 2020 design flows of 14 MLD, an additional 36 hectares would be required using the \nlagoon process. However, as a result of land restrictions in the narrow river valley below \nThimphu, such a large land area is unavailable. A mechanical WWTP is the only viable option. \nWhile a number of possible process options exist, the three most practical in terms of capital \nand O&M costs, local climate and temperature considerations, local wastewater characteristics, \nand Bhutan\u2019s effluent standards were evaluated and cost estimates prepared.32 The O&M of the \nproposed WWTP will require skilled operators, electricity, chemicals, and other recurring costs. \nWhile Thimphu Municipality\u2019s Sewage Section has experience with O&M of small mechanical \npackage plants, the new WWTP is of significantly larger capacity. \n \n                                                \n29 ADB. 2011.

Manila (TA 7630-BHU $700,000, approved on 29 October 2010). \n30 The project will build on existing implementation arrangements under the ongoing UIDP. The UIDP has an existing \nproject  steering  committee,  local  project  steering  committee  (LPSC)-Phuentsholing,  LPSC-Thimphu,  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), project implementation unit (PIU)-Phuentsholing, and PIU-Thimphu. Additional LPSCs \nand PIUs will be established in Nganglam Town and SJM. \n31 No power requirement and low operator skill level requirement. \n32 The actual process will be as offered by the winning bidder, but the three options evaluated are representative of \nexpected costs. \n ", "6 \n17.  To address the lack of mechanical WWTP process experience in Bhutan, the WWTP \ncontract will be procured as design\u2013build\u2013operate whereby the operation of the new WWTP is \nproposed to be done by the contractor for a 3-year period. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  15 February 2012\u201314 February 2018 \nEstimated completion date  14 February 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \nMOWHS (chair) \nDepartment of Public Aid, Ministry of Finance; DUDES, MOWHS; Gross \nNational Happiness Commission; National Environment Commission; \nNational Commission on Women and Children; Planning and Policy Division \n(MOWHS); Thimphu Municipality; Phuentsholing Municipality; SJM; \nNganglam Town; Bhutan Power Corporation; development partners \n(members) \nLocal project steering committee for Thimphu, Phuentsholing, SJM, and \nNganglam Town \nMayor thrompon or town head (dungpa) [chair] \nMunicipal agencies in the urban sector and other stakeholders (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  DUDES, MOWHS \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Thimphu, Phuentsholing, SJM, Nganglam Town, and DUDES \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU, four staff; PIU-Thimphu, five staff; PIU-Phuentsholing, four staff; PIU-\nSJM, four staff; and PIU-Nganglam Town, three staff \nProcurement  ICB  2 contracts  $15.630 million \nNCB  1 contracts  $0.890 million \nShopping  3 contracts  $0.180 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (project  68 person-months  $0.635 million \nmanagement \nconsultant) \nQCBS (design,  111 person-months  $1.098 million \nmonitoring, and \nsupervision consultant) \nQCBS (urban  18 person-months  $0.340 million \nmanagement \nconsultant) \nAdvance contracting  Tendering and bid evaluation of equipment and civil works packages and \nrecruitment of consultants \nThis includes (i) shopping for chlorinators in SJM; (ii) ICB, and bid \nevaluation for Phuentsholing bridge and access roads; and (iii) recruitment \nof project management, design, management, and supervision, and urban \nmanagement consultants. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  DUDES  =  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Engineering  Services; \nICB = international competitive bidding; MOWHS = Ministry of Works and Human Settlement; NCB = national \ncompetitive bidding; PIU = project implementation unit; PMU = project management unit; QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection; SJM = Samdrup Jongkhar Municipality. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n18.  O&M costs for various process options are likely to be similar as the majority of the cost \nof  operating  a  mechanical  WWTP  is  approximately  electricity  (60%),  chemicals  (15%), \nreplacement parts and consumables (10%), and only 10%\u201315% is labor. The O&M cost of the \nnew WWTP will be about Nu3.5 per cubic meter. The government plans to increase water \n ", "7 \ntariffs33 and subsidize WWTP O&M to ensure affordability. A tariff plan has been prepared \nshowing increases required to meet the increased O&M of the new WWTP.34 \n \n19.  While the WWTP will be sized for 14 MLD, with provision for easy expansion in a \nmodular fashion as sewage flows continue to grow, the aeration equipment/blowers will be \nlimited to the equivalent of 11 MLD\u2014the expected flow by 2016. The reasons for this include the \ncost of concrete structures, primary treatment of screening and de-gritting, and the sludge \nstabilization process for 14 MLD is almost the same as for 11 MLD and is, therefore, a logical \ninvestment, but underutilized aeration equipment would result in unnecessary investment and \npower consumption until flows increase to 14 MLD several years after the WWTP is built. \nAerators can readily be added as inflow to the plant gradually increases. \n \n20.  The bridge in Phuentsholing Municipality has been designed with a central pier in the \nstream bed.35 This is a lower cost option than doing it as a full span or as a suspension bridge. \nThere is a minor risk of erosion or scour around the pier, which will be mitigated by a gabion \nbuffer.  The  water  system  rehabilitation  in  SJM  will  include  refurbishing  two  water  intakes, \ntreatment plants and storage reservoirs, and replacement of most of the existing water trunk \nmains and distribution system, including service connections. The work will be done on existing \nfacilities  and  road  rights-of-way.  Suitable  specifications for  pipe materials  and  construction \ntechniques will be used. O&M of the refurbished system will be easier than for the existing \ndamaged system, and the water quality will be improved to potable standards. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the WSS and mobility outputs of the project. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the base-case scenario varies from 14.0% to 18.5%. \nThe  EIRR  is  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  12.0%.  A \nsensitivity analysis was also undertaken with the following scenarios: (i) capital costs increased \nby  10%,  (ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  and  (iii)  benefits  reduced  by  10%.  Under  all \nscenarios, the EIRRs remain above 12%. \n \n22.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \ncomponents were calculated with the following assumptions: (i) a weighted average cost of \ncapital is 2.04% for the water supply and wastewater components; (ii) a 25-year projection \nperiod, including a construction period of 5 years; and (iii) constant 2011 prices. The FIRR is \n9.1% for the water supply component and 2.3% for the wastewater component. A sensitivity \nanalysis was also undertaken with the following scenarios: (i) capital costs increased by 10%, \n(ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  (iii)  revenues  reduced  by  10%,  and  (iv)  completion  of \ncomponent delayed by 1 year. The FIRR varied from \u20130.6% to 9.1% for the water supply \ncomponent, and from a negative value to 2.3% for the wastewater component.36 Affordability \nanalysis shows suggested tariffs to be less than 5% of household income. \n \n                                                \n33 Consumers are currently charged for water and 50% of the water bill is for wastewater treatment. \n34 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ADB is also providing TA to help \nmodernize Thimphu Municipality\u2019s financial management and revenue generation. \n35 The bridge comprises 46.0 meters (m) effective span, with 6.6 m approach slabs and 10.0 m approach blocks on \neach side. It will also include a new approach road of 90.0 m, and improvement of 200.0 m of associated roads. \n36 The sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction of project benefits, particularly non-implementation of required \ntariff increases, is the most sensitive risk factor. \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n23.  A financial management assessment was undertaken for the executing agency and the \nimplementing agencies. Fiduciary risks were assessed as low at the country level. At the entity \nlevel,  control  risks  for  the  executing  agency  and  three  implementing  agencies,  currently \nimplementing UIDP, were also assessed as low. Adequate training will be provided for the two \nimplementing  agencies  (Nganglam  Town  and  SJM)  lacking  experience  in  ADB-financed \nprojects. In addition, ongoing TA37 is providing support to the Royal Audit Authority of Bhutan to \nincrease the accountability and transparency of public accounts. A governance assessment for \nthe interim country partnership strategy is also under preparation. Its objective is to formulate \nrisk assessments and risk mitigation plans for public financial management, procurement, and \nanticorruption risks at the country level and for the urban and energy sectors. Other than ADB, \nthe World Bank is providing assistance to two implementing agencies38 to increase revenues \nand improve financial management. Procurement will be undertaken by the executing agency \nand implementing agencies. The executing agency and three of the five implementing agencies \nhave experience under the UIDP; and have developed capacity to issue tenders, evaluate bids, \nand prepare bid evaluation reports. Newly formed project implementation units (PIUs) will be \ntrained  through  twinning  arrangements,  providing  on-the-job  training  from  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  and  the  design,  monitoring,  and  supervision  consultant.  Further \ncapacity will be built for all implementing agencies through the PMU and involving the executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies  in  annual  in-country  procurement  seminars  of  ADB. \nProcurement accountability is provided through the tender opening, tender evaluation, and \ntender award committees. Each committee has to make a declaration of no conflict of interest. \nThe three-tier system provides due diligence. All government staff and consultants are subject \nto group and individual audits. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MOWHS), the \nDepartment of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES), and the implementing \nagencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM.39 \n  \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project supports the government\u2019s poverty reduction program and contributes to the \nachievement  of  Millennium  Development Goal 7  by  providing  both  the  poor  and  non-poor \ncontinuous access to basic services including safe drinking water and adequate sanitation \nfacilities in Thimphu Municipality and SJM, and improved urban environment through bypass \nroad development in Phuentsholing Municipality. A health and hygiene awareness campaign \nunder the project will also enhance public participation and improve the health of poor families \nthrough improved hygiene behavior, as well as provide jobs for those involved in the sanitation \nbusiness  and  services,  the  majority  of  whom  are  from  poorer  households.  The  project  is \ncategorized \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming\u201d as it addresses specific gender issues, which \ninclude ensuring continuous access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities for \nhouseholds headed by women (49.6% of total households in the project areas). A consultation \nand participation plan and gender action plan have been prepared. The gender action plan will \nbe  implemented  and  monitored  by  the  PMU  in  coordination  with  the  Gender  and  Social \n                                                \n37  ADB. 2010.

Safeguards \n26.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B for environment. Three \ninitial environmental examinations (IEEs), including environmental management plans (EMPs), \nwere prepared and disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \ngovernment laws. Subprojects are not located in or near sensitive or protected areas, and the \nIEEs conclude no significant adverse impacts are anticipated from proposed locations, designs, \nand construction activities. The EMPs provide adequate mitigation measures to ensure impacts \nare limited and of short duration. The net environmental benefits will be positive and large, \nincluding (i) improved river water quality from sewerage treatment in Thimphu Municipality, \n(ii) improved  air  quality  and  pedestrian  safety  from  road  bypass  and  bridge  works  in \nPhuentsholing Municipality, and (iii) improved drinking water quality and quantity from water \nsupply improvements in SJM. Implementation arrangements in the PMU and PIUs build on \nprevious experience gained from the UIDP, and adequate capacity is ensured to manage \nenvironmental impacts through consultant support and additional capacity building. The IEEs \nand EMPs will be updated during detailed design as necessary and will be incorporated into \nbidding and contract documents to be implemented by contractors and monitored by the PIUs \nand PMU. Environmental reporting to ADB from the PMU will be done on a semiannual basis. \nAn environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to guide planning studies \nand detailed design of future investments in preparation for possible additional financing.40 \n \n27.  Social safeguards. The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  designed  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \nresettlement impacts, and social risks. A resettlement framework was prepared and disclosed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws41 to guide planning \nstudies and detailed designs of future investments (for possible additional financing not financed \nunder the project).42 Implementation arrangements build on previous experience gained from \nthe UIDP, and ensure that the PMU and PIUs have adequate capacity to understand and \nprepare resettlement plans, if necessary, through consultant support and additional capacity \nbuilding.  Considering  the  urban  locations  of  these  subprojects,  no  impacts  to  indigenous \npeoples are expected. Meaningful, widespread consultations will continue with all communities \nin the project area during implementation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.
