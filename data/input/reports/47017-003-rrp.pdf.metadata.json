The \nproject  will  reduce  losses  through metering  entire high-  and medium-voltage transmission grid \nand  expand  transmission  capacity  in  Panjakent  region,  which  presently  suffers  from  load \nshedding.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  performance  of  vertically  integrated  state-owned  joint  stock  company  Barki  Tojik, \nwhich  is  responsible  for  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  Tajikistan,  is \nunsatisfactory. The corporate governance is weak, the financial management is not sustainable, \nthe  company  structure  is  inadequate  and  the  quality  of  the  service  is  poor.  These  are \nexacerbated by a flawed initial power system design that ignores energy security considerations \nas well as limited investments for modernization made during the country\u2019s civil war. \n \nRealizing  that  poor  performance  of  the  power  sector  was  impeding  economic \n4. \ndevelopment, the government initiated a three-phase restructuring process (commercialization, \nseparation,  and  privatization)  of  Barki  Tojik  in  2011.  The  first  phase,  commercialization,  is \nsupported  by  the  Asian Development  Bank (ADB)  through  the  sector  operational  performance \nimprovement  (SOPI)  program. 3 The  program  addresses  governance,  financial  management, \ncontrol  and  audit,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  management  systems,  organizational \nstructure,  and  technical  operations.  On  11  June  2013,  the  government  approved  the \nrestructuring  action  plan  prepared  by  the  SOPI  program  and  the  new  structure  of  Barki  Tojik, \nwhich  established  three  departments  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  under  the \nsame  legal  entity.  On  5  September  2014,  Barki  Tojik  formally  adopted  the  new  structure  and \ntechnical separation principle between departments. Heads of the three departments have also \nbeen appointed, and formation of the new structure, based on international practices of modern \npower  utilities,  is  ongoing.  The  implementation  of  the  full-scale  management  contract  is  also \nbeing discussed between the government and international financial institutions, including ADB. \n \n5. \nImproving  the  operational  performance  of  Barki  Tojik  requires  not  only  organizational \nrestructuring  but  also  capital  investment.  While  the  entire  sector  needs  to  be  modernized, \ninvestments in loss reduction are a priority.4 Tajikistan\u2019s power system has an installed capacity \nof  5,356  megawatts  (MW)  comprising  eight  large  and  a  few  small  hydropower  plants  (4,737 \nMW), and three fossil fuel-fired combined heat and power plants (418 MW). In 2013, net power \ngeneration in Tajikistan was 16.9 terawatt-hours, of which only 13.4 terawatt-hours were billed. \nThe  difference  is  losses  and  system  own  consumption.  Total  transmission  and  distribution \nsystem  losses  in  Tajikistan,  as  in  any  power  system,  are  a  combination  of  technical  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the project.

Manila. \n\n4  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Power Sector Regional Master Plan. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2        \n\nnontechnical  (or  commercial)  losses.5 Both  types  of  losses  are  a  cost  to  Barki  Tojik,  as  they \nreduce the amount of electricity for which payment is received from customers. \n \n6. \nTotal  transmission  and  distribution  system  losses  in  Tajikistan  are  estimated  at  around \n22%,  of  which  transmission  system  technical  losses  accounted  for  5%  in  2013.6 Distribution \nsystem losses are 17% and have remained virtually unchanged since 2006. Barki Tojik does not \nrecognize commercial losses and therefore applies norms for technical losses to the amount of \nenergy  received  into  the  distribution  networks from transmission. These are  inaccurate figures \nand  understated  due  to  the  absence  of  proper  methodology  to  account  the  losses  and  a \nrelevant metering system. A wholesale metering system with sufficient accuracy for commercial \nbilling  has  never  been  installed  in  Tajikistan,  and  the  absence  of  such  a  system  results  in \ninaccurate cost calculations and cost recovery tariff calculations. \n \n7. \nReduction  of  nontechnical  losses  is  a  priority  for  the  government,  which  has  already \nbegun  to  address  the  issue.  The  turnkey  contract  for  installation  of  a  supervisory  control  and \ndata  acquisition  system  and  associated  telecommunication  system,  financed  by  ADB,  was \nawarded  in  September  2014  (footnote  3).  The  World  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development are financing the installation of the retail (end user) meters in \nthe  two  largest  load  centers\u2014Dushanbe  and  Khujand.  The  remaining  metering  gap  is  bulk \nelectricity  metering  from  generation  through  transmission  and  up  to  distribution  level  meters. \nThere  is  a  need for the  installation of  wholesale meters  and  an  associated  settlement  system, \nwhich  will  enable  the  management  of  Barki  Tojik  to  (i)  account  for  all  electricity  flows  and \nassociated  costs;  (ii)  quantify  technical  and  nontechnical  losses  at  the  wholesale  level  of  the \nentire  grid;  and  (iii)  support  the  utility  restructuring  by  defining  clear  commercial  borders \nbetween generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n8. \nCertain parts of the Tajikistan power system still suffer from transmission bottlenecks. In \nsome  regions,  current  demand  is  not  met  due  to  limited  transmission  capacity  and \ndisconnection  from  the  Central  Asian  Power  System  in  November  2009.  Presently,  the  most \npressing problem is in Panjakent region, which has a population of 261,000 (39,122 customers) \nand  several  large  industries.  The  demand  in  the  region  has  grown  steadily  since  2005,  with \npeak demand in 2013 reaching approximately 100 MW in the summer and 141 MW in the winter. \nHowever, electricity to Panjakent (through the Rudaki substation) has been supplied since 2011 \nfrom the main Tajik grid (through the 220-kilovolt [kV] Ayni substation) by a single circuit 110 kV \ntransmission line commissioned in 1965 with a rated capacity of 67 megavolt-amperes (MVA).7 \nThus, households and industry in the region suffer from frequent load shedding even during the \nsummer,  which  is  Tajikistan\u2019s  energy  surplus  period  due  to  98%  reliance  on  hydropower \n\n                                                \n5  Technical losses occur naturally and consist mainly of power dissipation in electricity systems. They are a measure \nof the amount of energy injected into the system (transmission or distribution), less the amount of energy offloaded \nfrom that system. They exist as a result of losses through the lines, the transformers, and associated systems (bus \nbars,  circuit  breakers,  metering,  and  connections),  and  they  are  usually  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  total \nenergy  injected  onto  the  system.  Combined  transmission  and  distribution  losses  can  range  from  8%  to  10%  in \ndeveloped modern power systems to over 40% in overloaded, poorly maintained systems in need of rehabilitation. \nCommercial  losses  result  from  inaccurate  calculation  of  technical  losses,  unauthorized  use  of  electricity  (theft), \nfaulty  meters,  unmetered  supplies,  unbilled  customers,  inaccurate  billing  of  customers,  dishonest  staff,  and \nnonpayment of electricity bills. They are a measure of the amount of energy injected into the system, less technical \nlosses  and  the  amount  of  energy  that  is  paid  for.  These  losses  are  usually  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total \nenergy entering the system, and they range from 2% to 3% in an organized modern utility company. \n\n6  SOPI program consultants estimate. \n7  Until  2011  the  Panjakent  electrical  network  was  still  supplied  with  two  220  kV  lines  with  a  rated  capacity  of  320 \nMVA each from Uzbekistan despite the 2009 disconnection from the Central Asian Power System.  In 2011, Barki \nTojik  completed  the  construction  of  a  new  220/110  kV  substation  and  energized  an  old  110  kV  line  to  supply \nPanjakent. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ngeneration.  Additional  transmission  capacity  is  urgently  needed  in  Panjakent  to  satisfy  current \nand  future  power  demand,  which  is  expected  to  grow  to  187 MW  by  2020  due  to  planned \nindustrial development. \n \nADB operations in the power sector have been based on government priorities and are \n9. \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2010\u20132014 for Tajikistan.8 The  project  is  included  in the  country  operations  business \nplan, 2014\u20132016 for Tajikistan.9 It will be the seventh project intervention in the power sector of \nTajikistan. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact of the project will be improved electricity supply to households and industry \nin  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  an  expanded  and  metered  transmission \nnetwork. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe outputs of the project will be (i) installation of approximately 1,100 wholesale meters \nand  an  associated  settlement  system  including  approximately  1,100  current  transformers  and \n700 voltage transformers; and (ii) construction of an approximately 95-kilometer (km) new single \ncircuit, single conductor 220 kV transmission line connecting Rudaki and Ayni substations with a \nrated capacity of 320 MVA. \n \nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $67 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nOutputs \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nItem \n  \nA.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nLessons from these projects regarding implementation arrangements, procurement, funds flow, \nsafeguards,  and  the  implementation  schedule  have  been  analyzed  and  incorporated  in  the \nproject. \n \nTwo  turnkey  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contracts  covering  the  entire \n17. \nproject will be procured by Barki Tojik. Procurement will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures  using  standard  bidding  documents  for  plant  design,  supply,  and  installation \ncontracts.  Engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contracts  will  use  a  single-stage:  two-\nenvelope  bidding  procedure  with  prior  review  and  without  prequalification.  The  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  consultants  will  assist  the  PMU  in  preparing  bidding \ndocuments and bid evaluation, and will also provide hands-on training to the PMU procurement \nstaff (footnote 2). \n \n18. \nBarki Tojik will employ a project implementation consultant firm that will provide technical, \nfinancial, and administrative support to the PMU during the entire project implementation period. \nADB  grant  proceeds  will  cover  the  cost  of  this  consulting  service  and  recruitment  will  follow \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a quality:cost ratio of 90:10 will be applied to the selection \nof the consultant firm. ADB's prior approval is needed for changing the selection method. \n \n19. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  for \nconsulting services. Advance contracting allows the government to start procurement activities \nat its own risk prior to the signing of the grant agreement, but it does not allow signing a contract \nwith  a  firm  before  the  grant  has  become  effective.  ADB  informed  the  government  that  such \nadvance  contracting  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.12 \n \n20. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  55-month  period  from  April  2015  to  October \n2019. The implementation consultant will prepare a detailed implementation schedule during the \npreconstruction phase of the project and submit it to ADB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nADB  conducted  in-depth  technical  due  diligence.  The  inspection  work  included \nassessments of (i) the existing metering and billing system; (ii) the accuracy, class, and age of \nmeters;  (iii)  the  condition  and  accuracy  of  current  transformers  and  voltage  transformers;  (iv) \nexisting  and  planned  communication  systems;  (v)  ongoing  end  user  metering  and  billing \nprojects; (vi) specifications and interface of the selected supervisory control and data acquisition \nsystem; and (vii) the condition of the transmission equipment in substations in Rudaki and Ayni \nand various alternative routes for the line. Various cost estimation methods were used to obtain \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nDirectors:  Proposed  Loans,  Technical  Assistance  Grants,  and  Administration  of  Loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of \nAfghanistan and the Republic of Tajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Interconnection Project.

The project implementation schedule was prepared taking \ninto account the demand profile to minimize impact from disconnections. \n \n22. \nInvestment  sites  were  visited  by  consultants  and  ADB  staff.  ADB  is  satisfied  with  the \nquality of the cost estimates, cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, and execution \nplan. The readiness level is high and the proposed technical solutions are assessed to be more \ncost-effective than the alternatives. Barki Tojik\u2019s operation and maintenance staff is familiar with \nthe proposed design concepts. The proposed metering and settlement system is consistent with \nexisting  practices.  However,  it  will  be  more  advanced  and  employ  state-of-the-art  technology \nthat will require training to be included in the terms of reference for consultants and contractors. \nThis is routine practice for a utility when first implementing similar systems. \n \nTajikistan is exposed  to climate change risks and variability. It is vulnerable to extreme \n23. \nweather  events  such  as  flooding  and  mass  movements.  The  project  has  taken  into \nconsideration  relevant  climate  measures  (e.g.,  improved  tower  standards,  avoidance  of  areas \nprone  to  mass  movements).  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  undertake  additional  soil \ninvestigations to avoid locating the towers on unsafe grounds. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal rate  of return  (EIRR)  is  19.2%,  confirming  the  project\u2019s \neconomic viability. The project will reduce system losses and increase the electricity consumed \nin the country. The project\u2019s incremental cost streams (i.e., capital investment and operation and \nmaintenance [O&M]), which reflect the costs of delivering the expected benefits (i.e., increased \nnet  electricity  consumption),  were  compared  with  a  without-project  scenario  based  on  2014 \nconstant prices for the project life of 25 years. The without-project scenario assumes that Barki \nTojik  does  not  implement  wholesale  metering  or  reinforce  the  power  transmission  capacity \nenvisaged  under  the  project.  The  EIRR  was  estimated  for  each  component  and  was \nconsolidated  for  the  project.13 The  sensitivity  analysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s \neconomic  viability  under  adverse  conditions,  including  increased  capital  and  O&M  costs,  and \nreduced benefits. \n \n25. \nThe financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the project. The financial internal \nrate of return of 15.8% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. Based on a \ncomparison of the with-project and without-project scenarios, the project cash flow, measured at \n2014  constant  prices for  the  project  life of  25  years, reflects the  costs (capital  investment  and \nO&M) and revenues (domestic sales) attributable to the project from Barki Tojik\u2019s perspective.14 \nThe project remains financially viable under the assumption that the end user tariffs continue to \nincrease  at  the  current  rate  of  13%  per  annum  in  real  terms.  The  sensitivity  analysis  also \nconfirms the project\u2019s financial sustainability under adverse conditions. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Barki  Tojik.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. \nTo  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  the  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n13 EIRR is 29.9% for the wholesale metering component and 15.1% for the transmission component. \n14 Financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  18.8%  for  the  wholesale  metering  component  and  14.4%  for  the  transmission \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nthe project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \n27. \nThe recent financial performance of Barki Tojik has been weak and unstable, generating \nlosses  for  FY2007\u2013FY2009,  profits  for  FY2010\u2013FY2011,  and  losses  again  in  FY2012.15 Barki \nTojik\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  requires  significant  improvement.  External  auditing  for \nFY2011  and  FY2012  based  on  international  audit  standards  indicate  major  issues  with  (i) \nvaluation  of  inventory,  (ii)  revaluation  of  assets,  (iii)  records  on  account  receivables  and \npayables,  and  (iv)  data  reconciliation  of  revenues. 16  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  accounting  policies, \nprocedures, and financial reporting follow International Financial Reporting Standards, which is \nrequired  under  the  Law  of  Accounting  and  other  decrees  of  the  government.17 Each  of  the  30 \nsubordinate  entities  under  the  head  office  prepares  its  own  financial  report,  and  these  are \nconsolidated at the holding company level. Barki Tojik has an internal audit unit established at \nthe  head  office,  but  with  limited  independence.  External  independent  auditors  have  been \nengaged  to  undertake  auditing  based  on  international  auditing  standards  for  the  holding \ncompany in compliance with the statutory requirements.18 \n \n28. \nSubstantial  efforts  are  being  made to strengthen  the financial  management  capacity  of \nthe  power  utility.  In  2011,  the  government  initiated  a  comprehensive  program  to  restructure \nBarki  Tojik.  ADB  provided  support  through  the  SOPI  program  to  improve  the  commercial \noperations and financial performance of the utility, and to strengthen its capacity to service debt \nwhile  providing  high-quality  services  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  4.  SOPI  program  includes \ninstitutional strengthening and reorganization of Barki Tojik using a phased approach  (phase 1 \ninvolves sector assessment, phase 2 preparation of a detailed restructuring plan, and phase 3 \nthe restructuring itself). The program addresses governance, financial management, control and \naudit,  legal  and regulatory frameworks,  management  systems,  and  organizational  structure.  In \naddition,  the  program  will  deal  with  technical  operations  and  planning  to  optimize  future \ninvestments and allocate sufficient funds for system maintenance. It will also address corporate \nfinancing,  debt  management,  and  debt  restructuring.  SOPI  program  consultants  have  already \nrevised  existing  tariff  methodology  and  started  to  develop  new  tariff  structures  for  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  departments.  Installation  of  the  wholesale  metering  system  will \nenable proper cost accounting, which is necessary to determine the cost recovery tariff level. \n \n29. \nOn 11  June 2013, the government  approved  (i) the  assessment report  prepared under \nthe SOPI program; (ii) the intervention plan prepared by the SOPI program consultants; and (iii) \nthe  new  structure  of  Barki  Tojik,  with  three  departments  (generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution)  under  the  same  legal  entity.  The  detailed  restructuring  plan  was  completed  and \napproved on 5 March 2014. The milestones have been set for the formation of the departments \nunder  the  new  structure  and  appointment  of  personnel.  The  entire  process,  including \nappointment  of  staff  in  regional  offices,  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  1  May  2015.  The \n                                                \n15 Details of the financial position of Barki Tojik are in the Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). ADB is in dialogue with the government to soften  the onlending terms (para. \n13),  which  will  contribute  to  improving  the  financial  position  of  the  utility.  Management  of  the  debt  is  also  a \ncomponent under the SOPI program. \n\n16 External  auditing  of  Barki  Tojik  by  independent  auditors  has  resulted  in  a  disclaimer  of  opinion  for  FY2010\u2013\n\nFY2012. Auditing for FY2013 has not been completed yet. \n\n17 Government\u2019s  Decree  428  of  4  November  2002  for  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards;  Government\u2019s \nDecree  231  of  2  May  2010  for  Additional  Arrangements  for  Implementing  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards in the Republic of Tajikistan; and President\u2019s Decree 702 of 25 March 2011 for the Law of Accounting. \n18 President\u2019s Decree 626 for the Law on Financial Management and Internal Control; and President\u2019s Decree 631 for \n\nthe Law on Internal Audit. \n\n \n\n\f8        \n\nPoverty and Social \n\npreparation  of  an  opening  balance  sheet  and  annual  budget  for  each  department  is  also \nongoing. \n \n30. \nAs  part  of  a  separate  project  funded  by  the  World  Bank,  Barki  Tojik  recruited \ninternational consultants to revalue assets in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards  and  assess  issues  related  to  account  receivables  and  payables. 19  Automated \naccounting and billing systems are being introduced, starting in major cities such as Dushanbe \nand  Khujand.  Continued  efforts  are  needed  to  steadily  increase  the  tariff  level,  improve  tariff \ncollection  efficiency  through  the  adoption  of  computerized  accounting  and  reporting  systems, \nand  modernize  and  rehabilitate  productive  assets  through  investment.  The  last  tariff  increase, \nwhich averaged 15%, occurred on 3 June 2014. Positive changes are expected in Barki Tojik\u2019s \naccounting procedures, financial reporting, and management reporting systems in 2014\u20132016. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nA  reliable  supply  of  electricity  brings  significant  benefits  to  communities  (especially \npoorer  ones),  including  enhanced  incomes  and  livelihoods,  improved  health  and  education, \nbetter  security,  and  a  generally  higher  standard  of  living.  In  Tajikistan,  winter  is  difficult  for \npeople who lack reliable electricity and cannot afford adequate alternatives (or must spend time \nseeking fuel). Women  in  particular  will  benefit from  the  project  because  they  bear the  brunt  of \nhousehold  and  family  responsibilities,  including  gathering  fuel  for  cooking,  heating,  and \nprocessing water; and caring for children, the sick, and the elderly. Electricity also offers women \nmore  opportunities  for  home-based  enterprises  and  income  generation,  and  it  has  positive \nimpacts on public facilities such as schools and health centers. \n \nHowever,  because  this  project  will  provide  metering  in  existing  substations  (which  will \n32. \nthen  supply  electricity  to  the  entire  grid)  as  well  as  a  new  transmission  line  and  towers,  the \nbenefits  (although  substantial)  are  generalized  and  indirect,  and  do  not  target  particular \ncommunities.  Similarly,  there  will  not  be  specific  power  supply  benefits  for  particular  social \ngroups  such  as  women  or  the  poor,  beyond  those  that  accrue  to  electricity  consumers  in \ngeneral.  The  technological  nature  of  the  project  allows  little  scope  for  social  components,  and \nthe project provides no opportunities for specific pro-poor initiatives. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  were  prepared  by  Barki  Tojik  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  There  are  two  legally  protected \nareas and one important bird area located in the project area or its proximity. An approximately \n1.5 km  section  of the  transmission  line  passes  outside the  northern  boundary  of the  Say  Vota \nBotanical  Reserve  (International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  category  4)  conserving \njuniper.  The  environmental  field  survey  found  that  no  significant  impacts  on  the  reserve  are \nexpected. 20  The  Rudaki  substation  and  the  power  line  in  Panjakent  are  located  in  close \nproximity to the Sarazm Important Bird Area. The mitigation measures proposed in the project \ndesign  include  bird  diverters  to  prevent  collision  of  birds  with  conductors,  and  bird  spikes  that \nhave been effective on other transmission lines in Tajikistan. The Zarafshan Complex Reserve \n(International Union for Conservation of Nature category 4) is 3 km from the project area and is \nnot impacted by the project. Other anticipated adverse environmental impacts of the project are \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n19 World Bank. 2005.

Adequate  mitigation  measures  were  designed  and  will  be  implemented \nthrough  the  EMP.  The  safeguard  capacity  of  the  PMU  is  limited;  therefore,  the  EMP  includes \ntraining of PMU personnel in environmental management. Public consultations were conducted \nin the project area from 25 to 28 July 2014. The initial environmental examination and the EMP \nwere disclosed on the ADB website on 16 September 2014. \n \n34. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the \nproject\u2019s  preliminary  design,  approximately  0.70  hectares  of  farmland  will  be  permanently \nacquired, and approximately 20 hectares will be temporarily acquired for various activities such \nas  stringing  towers  and  building  access  roads.  The  temporary  land  acquisition  will  have  an \nimpact  on  crops  and  trees.  Entitlements  for  the  various  impacts,  such  as  permanent  land \nacquisition,  crop  and  tree  loss,  and  allowances  for  vulnerable  and  severely  affected  persons, \nhave  already  been  defined  in  the  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP),  which \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 16 September 2014. Once the final design is available, a \nmore detailed survey of impacts will be undertaken to determine the extent of actual involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  Public  consultation  with  the  potential  affected  persons  and  the  general \npublic  has  been  undertaken  for  purposes  of  the  draft  LARP.  Another  round  of  public \nconsultations will be done during the finalization of the LARP. \n \n35. \nwill not impact indigenous people or any similar groups during construction and operation. \n \nF. \n \n36. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.21 \n \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.

The project implementation consultants will \nsupervise installation, manage contracts and finances, and monitor \nenvironmental programs and reports. Bid documents will envisage a \nlump sum payment with penalties for late completion. \nThe SOPI program consultants will address staffing deficiencies \nthrough extensive training until the project implementation consultants \nare recruited. The implementation consultants will be actively involved \nwith the project after the contract award. Inadequacies in the number of \nstaff of Barki Tojik will be addressed by its ongoing restructuring. \nADB\u2019s SOPI program consultants will assist Barki Tojik in its corporate \n\nStaffing deficiencies and \ninsufficient capacity of Barki \nTojik and PMU to manage \nprocurement and contract \nadministration \nInadequate corporate \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10        \n\nstructure; weak financial \nmanagement, accounting \nand auditing policy and \nprocedures, and reporting \npractices \n \n\nrestructuring to improve the efficiency of utility operations.b This \nrestructuring will be further supported by a World Bank program \naddressing the introduction of International Financial Reporting \nStandards, asset valuation, receivables, billing and auditing, and \nfinancial capacity development.
