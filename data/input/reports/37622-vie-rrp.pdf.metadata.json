The Project focuses on capacity building for teacher \ndevelopment, and will have no negative environmental impact.  \n \nThe Project will support the Government\u2019s development goals by \nsupporting  improvements  in  the  quality  of  secondary  education \nthrough extensive support for teacher education for general upper \nsecondary and professional secondary education.  \n \nThe  Government  strongly  emphasizes  the  need  to  expand \nsecondary  education,  particularly  professional  secondary  (PS) \neducation. It recognizes that expansion must be accompanied by \nimprovements  in  quality  if  the  education  system  is  to  meet  the \ncountry\u2019s  needs  for  a  skilled  and  well-qualified  labor  force. \nEnrollment  projections  indicate  significant  rates  of  growth  until \n2010.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  help  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  by \nimproving the quality of upper secondary (US) education and PS, \nthereby  producing  a  better  qualified  and  more  productive  work \nforce. The project outcomes will be (i) improved quality of US and \nPS  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training;  (ii)  expanded \naccess    for  ethnic  minorities,  particularly  women,  to  US  and  PS \nteacher  development;  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  for  planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of teacher training for US and PS; and \n(iv)  improved  facilities  to  strengthen  instructional  capability  in \nteacher training institutes. The Project will (i) enhance access and \nequity, training quality, efficiency, and management; (ii) sponsor a \nnational teacher development system to integrate preservice and \nin-service training; and (iii) provide targeted support to (a) teacher \ntraining  institutes  (TTIs)  in  ethnic  minority  areas;  (b)  ethnic \nminority  students,  particularly  women;  and  (c)  TTIs  in  areas  with \nrapid economic growth. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $43.18  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties.  \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nii \n\n \n \n\n \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal Cost \n\nSource \n\n% \n78.70 \n21.30 \n100.00 \n\nTotal \n\n34.00 \n9.18 \n43.18 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $34,000,000  equivalent  from  the  Special  Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe term of the loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. ADB will finance 78.7% of \nthe  project  costs.

A  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished within MOET for project implementation. The PMU will \nhave  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  including \nprocurement,  planning,  budgeting,  monitoring,  coordinating,  and \nreporting.  The  PMU  Director  will  be  responsible  for  reporting \nprogress  of  the  project  to  the  Minister/Vice-Minister  on  a  regular \nbasis.  Each  beneficiary  TTI  will  also  establish  a  Project \nImplementation  Unit  (PIU).  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  Project  activities  in  their  respective  TTIs  and \nwill  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  PMU.  Project \nManagement  Cells  (PMCs),  headed  by  an  official  of  DOET, \nmaybe  established  in  project  provinces  for  coordinating  project \nactivities  at  the  provincial  level.  Each  PMC  will  submit  quarterly \nreports to the PMU.  \n \nAll goods and works financed under the Project will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as \namended \nreflecting  ADB's  policy  on \nanticorruption.  \n \nA total input of 132 person-months of international consulting and \n492  person-months  of  national  consulting  will  be  provided  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting \nservices  cover  broad  areas  of  expertise  that  include  (i)  policy \nevaluation and reform, (ii) teacher education preservice curriculum \nand instructional material design, (iii) teacher education in-service \n\ntime) \n\nfrom \n\ntime \n\nto \n\n\f \n\niii \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n(v) \n\nteacher \n\nteacher \n\nthrough \n\nrecruited \n\ntraining  programs \n\nregistration  procedures, \n\ntheir  professional  competencies \n\ncurriculum  and  instructional  material  design,  (iv)  accreditation \nprocedures, \n(vi)  data \ncollection  and  analysis,  (vii)  information  and  communication \ntechnology  curriculum,  (viii)  educational  management  information \nfacilities  and  equipment \n(ix) \nsystem  development,  and \nimprovement. \nfor \nIndividual  consultants  will  be \nprocurement,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nConsulting  firms  will  be  recruited  for  the  remaining  services  and \nrecruitment  will  be  carried  out  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method.  \n \nThe Project will have substantial benefits for the education sector, \nin particular secondary education, through systemic improvements \nfor design, delivery, and management of teacher development for \nUS and PS. \n \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project will be (i) current and future \nUS  and  PS  teachers  who  will  have  continuing  opportunities  to \nimprove \nimproved \npreservice  and  in-service  training  programs;  and  (ii)  ethnic \nminority groups, particularly women, who will have greater access \nto  quality \nthrough  provision  of \nscholarships,  dormitories,  and  enhanced  facilities  in  TTIs  serving \nethnic  minority  areas.  The  project-initiated  improvement  in  their \nprofessional  development  will  better  ensure  that  all  US  and  PS \nstudents are provided with a school experience that contributes to \nlife choices, to reduction of poverty through greater employability, \nand  to  the  achievement  of  national  economic  development  goals \nthrough a better qualified work force. The indirect beneficiaries will \nbe  current  and  future  US  and  PS  students  who  will  benefit  from \ninstruction from a better qualified teaching force. \n \nThe major project risk emanates from the number of institutions to \nbe supported by the Project and the combination of hardware and \nsoftware  inputs.  This  will  require  considerable  management \ncapacity  within  the  project  management  unit  to  ensure  project \ninputs  within  the  time  lines  and  resources  outlined.  The  Project \nmitigates  this  risk  by  requiring  establishment  of  coordination  and \noversight  committees  within  the  project  management  unit  and \neach  beneficiary  TTI  to  monitor  progress  and  take  timely \nmeasures to address delays.  \n \nAny  faltering  of  commitment  to  review  policy  issues  related  to \nteacher  development, \nrecruitment,  deployment, \nstandardization  of  qualifications,  and  career  development,  will \nimpact  policy  formulation.  The  Government  has  expressed  its \nsupport  for  a  comprehensive  policy  framework.  The  Project  will \nsupport  this  policy  framework  with  an  agreed  implementation \nframework.  \n \nAdequate  budgetary  provision  will  be  needed  for  postproject \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n\foperation  and  maintenance  costs  to  maximize  benefits  through \nproperly  maintained  facilities  and  updated  databases.  Additional \nresources  will  be  needed  for  periodic  upgrading  of  training \ncurriculum  and  in-service  training,  as  determined  by  the  policy \nreview.  Budgetary  support  for  education  increased  from  3.5%  of \ngross  domestic  product  in  1996  to  4.6%  in  2005.  In  view  of  the \nprojected  robust  growth  of  the  national  economy,  budgetary \nsupport \nto  remain  strong.  The \nis  expected \nGovernment has also committed to providing adequate resources \nto support reforms undertaken by the Project. \n\nfor  education \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n108  00\u2019E\n\nVIET NAM\nUPPER SECONDARY AND\nPROFESSIONAL TEACHER\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nHa Giang\n\n7\n\n9\n\nCao Bang\n\n1\n\nLai Chau\n\nLao Cai\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\nBac Kan\n\n8\nYen Bai\n\nTuyen Quang\n11\n\n16\n\nThai Nguyen\n\nLang Son\n\nSon La\n\nPhu Tho\n5\n\n12\n\nVinh Phuc\n13\n\n18\nBac Giang\n\n17\n\n2\n\nDien Bien\n\n3\n\nHANOI\n\n20\n\n15\n\nHoa Binh\n23\n\n24\n\n14\n\n19\n\nHai\nDuong\n\n21\n\nHai Phong\n\n22\nThai Binh\n\nHa Long\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Location\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n25\n\n26\nNinh Binh\n\nThanh Hoa\n\n27\n\n28\n\nVinh\n\nHa Tinh\n\n29\n\nDong Hoi\n\n30\n\nDong Ha\n\n31\n\nHue\n\n32\n\nDa Nang\n\nHoi An\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\nQuang Ngai\n\n36\n\nKon Tum\n\n38\n\nPleiku\n\n37\n\nQuy Nhon\n\n39\n\nTuy Hoa\n\n40\n\nNha Trang\n\nDak Nong\n\n41\n\nDa Lat\n\n42\n\n44\n\nPhan Rang-\nThap Cham\n\nPhan Thiet\n\nSOUTH   CHINA\nSEA\n\nCAMBODIA\n\nBuon Ma Thuot\n\n46\n\nTay Ninh\n\n47\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nBien Hoa\n\n45\n\nBinh\nLong\n\n48\n\n50\n\n43\n\n49\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nVung Tau\n\nDong Thap\n\n52\nTan An\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\nLong Xuyen\n\nRach Gia\n\nVinh Long\n\n58\nCan Tho\n\n59\n\n57\nHau Giang\n56\n\n62\n\n51\n\nMy Tho\n\n60\n\nBen Tre\n\n61\n\nTra Vinh\n\n63\n\nSoc Trang\n\nCa Mau\n\nBac Lieu\n\n64\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n26.\n27.\n28.\n29.\n30.\n31.\n32.\n33.\n34.\n35.\n36.\n37.\n38.\n39.\n40.\n41.\n42.\n43.\n44.\n45.\n46.\n47.\n48.\n49.\n50.\n51.\n52.\n53.\n54.\n55.\n56.\n57.\n58.\n59.\n60.\n61.\n62.\n63.\n64.\n\nLai Chau\nDien Bien\nSon La\nLao Cai\nPhu Tho\nTuyen Quang\nHa Giang\nYen Bai\nCao Bang\nBac Kan\nThai Nguyen\nVinh Phuc\nHa Noi\nBac Ninh\nHung Yen\nLang Son\nQuang Ninh\nBac Giang\nHai Duong\nHa Tay\nHai Phong\nThai Binh\nHoa Binh\nHa Nam\nNinh Binh\nNam Dinh\nThanh Hoa\nNghe An\nHa Tinh\nQuang Binh\nQuang Tri\nThua Thien Hue\nDa Nang\nQuang Nam\nQuang Ngai\nKon Tum\nGia Lai\nBinh Dinh\nPhu Yen\nDak Lak\nDak Nong\nKhanh Hoa\nLam Dong\nNinh Thuan\nBinh Phuoc\nTay Ninh\nBinh Duong\nDong Nai\nBinh Thuan\nBa Ria - Vung Tau\nHo Chi Minh\nLong An\nTien Giang\nDong Thap\nAn Giang\nKien Giang\nHau Giang\nCan Tho\nVinh Long\nBen Tre\nTra Vinh\nSoc Trang\nBac Lieu\nCa Mau\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\n06-4007 HR\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA.  \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nViet  Nam  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  access  to  education,  having \nachieved  a  net  enrollment  ratio  (NER)  in  2005  of  94%  for  primary  education  and  51%  for \nsecondary  (a  significant  increase  for  secondary  from  18.7%  in  1993).  Annual  enrollment  in \nupper secondary (US) education over the past 9 years increased by an average of 12.9%, while \nthe corresponding increase in the vocationally oriented professional secondary (PS) education \nwas  11%.  The  Government  projects  that  average  annual  increases  in  US  enrollment  will \ngradually  decline  from  14.6%  in  2005  to  4.8%  in  2010.  However,  the  Government  expects \nparticipation in US by 2010 will be 60%, exceeding its target of 50%. PS enrollment increases \nare expected to rise from an annual rate of 4.9% in 2005 to 14.6% in 2010, creating ambitious \nteacher  expansion  targets.  Together,  both  subsectors  will  require  approximately  58,000  more \nteachers  until  2010\u2014an  increase  of  43.9%  excluding  the  needs  arising  from  attrition  rates \nnotionally  set  at  5%  per  annum.  This  large  increase  will  strain  the  ability  of  teacher  training \ninstitutes (TTIs) to supply the teachers required if current student-teacher ratios are to continue. \nIf lower ratios are to be realized to enhance student learning, demand for additional teachers will \nbe even higher.  \n\n3. \nThe challenge is not only to increase the number of trained teachers but also to enhance \nthe quality of training. The Government also recognizes the need to improve classroom teaching \nmethodologies  to  engender  in  future  students  the  knowledge  and  creative  skills  required  to \ncontribute  to  the  achievement  of  declared  national  development  goals.  This  will  require \nimproving  TTIs\u2019  capacity  to  modernize  staff  training  techniques.  Further,  accreditation \nprocedures need to be established for training institutions to ensure standardization and quality \nof the training curriculum. Finally, progressive consistency is needed between preservice and in-\nservice training.  \n\n4. \nViet Nam\u2019s economy is growing faster than that of all other Southeast Asian countries. \nThe  Government  places  significant  emphasis  on  expanding  the  reach  of  and  improving  the \nquality  of  education  to  sustain  the  pace  of  economic  growth  and  maintain  competitiveness. \nSince  primary  education  is  almost  universal,  the  secondary  education  sector  is  particularly \npositioned for rapid expansion.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n5. \nAs the economy continues to expand, school graduates need to be better equipped with \nthe  wide  range  of  problem-solving  and  research  skills  that  emerging  knowledge  industries \nrequire. In response, a new curriculum has been developed for US that changes pedagogy from \nreliance on passive learning to an emphasis on student-centered learning that fosters curiosity \nand creativity. Teachers in schools need to be retrained in the new pedagogy, including the use \nof  information  technology;  and  those  training  to  be  teachers  need  to  achieve  a  reconstructed \nview  of  teaching.  To  acquire  these  new  skills,  trainee  teachers  need  to  experience  them \nthroughout  their  training,  so  that  they  discover  the  benefits  of  enquiry-based  learning  and  its \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\napplication to personal development and employability. This will require TTI staff to update their \nown  teaching  methods  to  model  the  best  teaching  styles,  including  more  informed  monitoring \nand  assessment  techniques  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  and  quality  of  their  trainees\u2019  learning. \nThe use of information technology needs to be an integral part of teacher training programs, as \nstudents will be working in an increasingly rich information technology environment throughout \ntheir careers. A summary of the key issues follows.  \n\n1. \n\nAccess \n\n6. \nEven though significant progress has been made in improving access to education, the \nNER for US is still low at approximately 51%. Ethnic minority students are underrepresented at \n9.4%  of  total  enrollment.  Even  though  enrollment  rates  of  ethnic  minority  students  are \nincreasing,  they  are  still  below  those  of  the  general  population.  Poverty  is  a  significant \ndeterminant of disadvantage with a NER of 17.1% for the poorest compared with 67.2% for the \nrichest.1 Urban\u2013rural  enrollment  disparities  are  significant  with  59.2%  of  students  enrolled  in \nurban  areas  against  37.7%  in  rural  areas.  Rural  areas  also  have  significantly  lower  school \ncompletion  rates.  For  some  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  in  remote  rural  areas, \nattendance  at  school  is  far  below  other  groups;  and  poverty  among  ethnic  minority  groups  is \ndeclining  at  a  lower  rate  than  in  the  general  population.  Overall  labor  force  participation  rates \nare  lower  for  women,  although  they  are  well  represented  in  the  teaching  force.  Of  all  US \nteachers,  approximately  56.1%  are  women  and  3.5%  are  from  ethnic  minorities.  Women \nrepresent  45%  of  PS  teachers;  corresponding  data  for  ethnic  minority  representation  is  not \navailable.  \n\nThe  remote  mountain  areas  continue  to  have  difficulty  attracting  qualified  teachers. \n7. \nResidents have poor access to teaching as a career, and teachers in isolated areas have poor \naccess to in-service support. Increased support is needed to improve access to teacher training \nprograms  for  students  from  ethnic  minorities  and  people  from  remote  rural  areas;  and  to \nimprove the quality of teacher education programs, both preservice and in-service, so that local \nteachers have the opportunity to develop professional competencies and pedagogical skills. \n\nQuality \n\n2. \n \n8. \nCurriculum  and  Assessment.  While  new  curriculum  standards  have  been  developed \nfor primary and lower secondary teacher training courses, no corresponding improvements have \nbeen  introduced  for  either  US  or  PS  teacher  training.  Training  improvements  are  urgently \nneeded to support the new school curriculum and model pedagogy that encourages students to \nexplore complex ideas and use knowledge in creative, problem-solving ways.  \n \n9. \nTeacher  Quality.  Seventeen  percent  of  PS  teachers  are  underqualified.  Teacher \ntraining courses, in general, tend to be based on traditional passive approaches to learning\u2014in \nstark  contrast  to  the  Government\u2019s  stated  policy  of  significantly  improving  current  classroom \npractice by shifting from passive to active learning through more creative and student-centered \npedagogy, including the use of information technology. \n \n10. \nIn-service support for teachers is needed to ensure that teachers\u2019 professional practice \nremains up-to-date and relevant. This will require strong links between preservice and in-service \ntraining courses to ensure that teacher education  is a consistent, logical, career-long process. \nInduction programs need to be developed to support teachers in their first year of teaching as \n\n                                                 \n1   2004. Vietnam Development Report. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n3. \n\nUpper Secondary and Professional Secondary Education \n\nmany  teaching  graduates  have  had  only  limited  or  no  practice  in  actual  classroom  teaching. \nSuch  induction  programs  will  help  improve  the  performance  of  beginner  teachers,  and\u2014\nconsistent with international practice\u2014help retain young teachers within the profession. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe  final  phase  of  secondary  education  is  divided  into  two  subsectors.  US  provides \ngeneral  education  with  a  focus  on  higher  education,  while  PS  has  a  major  focus  on  technical \nand  vocational  training.  US  is  the much  larger  of  the  two subsectors. In  2005  it  accounted  for \n85.7% of schools, 88.4% of teachers, and 85.7% of students. It has lower student-teacher ratios \nof  26.29:1  compared  with  33.47:1  for  PS.  While  both  subsectors  have  experienced  similar \nenrollment  growth  over  the  past  5  years,  the  PS  growth  rates  for  teachers  and  number  of \nschools  are  much  lower.  The  Government\u2019s  recent  enrollment  projections  for  2005\u20132010 \nindicate  an  average  growth  rate  of  8%  for  US  and  15%  for  PS.  Statistics  also  indicate  that \namong regions student-teacher ratios for US are very similar, but vary considerably for PS. The \nMekong  River  Delta  and  the  South  East  regions  appear  to  be  disadvantaged,  as  they  have \nconsiderably  higher  ratios  than  elsewhere.  Higher  demand  for  vocational  education  as \nevidenced by rapidly increasing enrollment and government's emphasis on vocational education \nreflect  the  human  resource  needs  of  a  rapidly  growing  economy.  A  detailed  sector  and \nsubsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12. \nCurrently, responsibility for preservice teacher training is dispersed among a wide range \nof  institutions  with  an  uneven  geographic  distribution.  Despite  the  large  number  of  institutions \nproviding  preservice  training,  capacity  to  meet  projected  demand  is  likely  to  be  stretched  and \nsome areas have unmet demand in some subjects. Pedagogy and the quality of all TTI courses \nneed to be improved through appropriate accreditation procedures to ensure a high standard of \nentry competencies of all new teachers.  \n \n \n \n13. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has  a  complex  structure  under  a \nminister  of  education  and  training,  supported  by  six  vice  ministers  responsible  for  various \ndepartments  within  the  education  portfolio  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  This  complexity  can \ncreate  both  policy  and  data  collection  difficulties,  with  various  departments  communicating \ninadequately with one another. At the same time, decentralization is occurring, albeit gradually. \nLocal  departments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs)  are  being  given  greater  authority,  as \nschool principals. Within the teacher training sector, MOET is responsible for the management \nof  preservice  training,  while  the  DOETs  play  a  stronger  role  in  in-service  training.  MOET  has \nlimited  capacity  to  provide  accurate  and  timely  information,  or  to  analyze  trends  to  better  plan \nfuture policies and programs. This constrains its ability to ensure quality of planning associated \nwith teacher training. Although MOET has exhibited strong commitment to education, it needs \nsupport  to  develop  a  policy  and  quality  assurance  framework  for  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment; and an information management system that will allow it to plan and manage the \ntraining and career development of the large teaching force. The Project will provide capacity-\nbuilding support for developing a comprehensive policy framework for teacher education; for an \naccreditation  process  for  training  courses;  and  a  teacher  information  management  system, \nincluding professional profiles of teachers.  \n \n \n \n \n\nManagement and Institutional Capacity \n\n4. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n6. \n\n5. \n\nGovernment Policies \n\nEducation Sector Strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n\n \n \n14. \nThe  Government  accords  very  high  priority  to  education  as  a  tool  for  achieving  its \nnational  development  goals.  The  Government\u2019s  Education  Development  Strategic  Plan  for \n2001\u20132010  outlines  the  major  educational  reforms.  The  Government  has  also  committed  that \nwithin the education sector it will increase support to PS to improve the quality and number of \ntechnical  workers.  This  policy  responds  to  a  perceived  need  to  better  match  human  capital \ndevelopment with industry needs. In May 2005, the minister of education and training released a \ndocument  identifying  59  areas  for improvement\u2014at  least  half  are  relevant  to  the  Project.2 The \nProject  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  educational  goals,  and  proposes  activities  to \nsupport  relevant  areas  for  improvement  that  cover  both  preservice  and  in-service  education; \nand  include  improved  pedagogy,  accreditation,  contemporary  knowledge  and  skills,  and  an \nincreased focus on PS. The Government has matched its stated commitment to education with \nhigher  budgetary  allocations.  Education\u2019s  share  as  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product \nincreased  from  3.5%  in  1996  to  4.6%  in  2004.  However,  despite  increasing  budgetary \nallocations, rapid expansion at higher levels of education, particularly secondary education, will \ncontinue  to  strain  available  resources.  Expansion  occurs  at  the  expense  of  quality,  unless \nresources are specifically targeted to quality enhancement interventions.  \n \n \n \n15. \nThe  vision  for  education  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  as  stated  in  its  policy \ndocument  Education  (2002),  is  that  all  children  and  adults  will  have  equitable  access  to \neducation of sufficient quality to empower them to break out of the poverty cycle, improve their \nquality  of  life,  and  participate  effectively  in  national  development.  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy  also  calls  for  support  for  provision  of  basic  services,  including  education,  as  a  key \npoverty reduction measure.  \n \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  education  sector  in  Viet  Nam  has  evolved  to  emphasize  the \n16. \nconsolidation of investments made during past projects and to build upon them toward holistic \nplanning  and  management  for  the  education  sector.  The  process  began  under  the  ADB- \nfinanced  Primary  Education  Development  Project.  It  was  then  extended  through  the  Lower \nSecondary  Education  Development  Project,  including  the  lower  secondary  Teacher  Training \nProject,  which  created  infrastructure  for  teacher  training  and  will  be  strengthened  and \nconsolidated under the ongoing Upper Secondary Education Development Project. The Upper \nSecondary  and  Professional  Teacher  Development  Project  will  provide  critical  complementary \nsupport  to  past  and  ongoing  initiatives  in  secondary  education  by  improving  teacher \ncompetencies, an area recognized to be the key to improving education quality. Therefore, the \nProject complements ADB\u2019s support for US, where ADB is the lead funding agency. The Project \nis designed to support ADB\u2019s strategy of taking a longer term perspective of sector development \nand  committing  to  a  series  of  interventions  that  focus  on  high-priority  goals  and  measurable \ntargets within a sector policy framework. ADB assistance to the education sector in Viet Nam is \nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  of  improving  access  to  and  quality  of  secondary \neducation.  The  Project  supports  the  targets  of  the  Government\u2019s  Education  Development \nStrategic  Plan  for  2001\u20132010  of  increasing  enrollment  in  US  and  PS  through  selective \nexpansion  of  physical  facilities  in  selected  TTIs;  and  supporting  poverty  reduction  through  a \n\n                                                 \n2   Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2005.

The Project also supports ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nViet Nam,3 which emphasizes support for the Government\u2019s educational reforms. \n \n\n7. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n17. \nExternal assistance to Viet Nam reached $2 billion in 2003, placing Viet Nam among the \ntop 10 recipient countries. Education\u2019s share of external assistance ranges from 8.5% to 10%. \nWithin  education  expenditures,  external  assistance  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in \neducation  development.  ADB  is  the  lead  funding  agency  in  the  education  sector  having \nsupported five projects for lower and upper secondary education since 1999. The World Bank is \nthe other major funding agency with support concentrated on basic and higher education. Other \nfunding  agencies  supporting  the  education  sector  include  the  European  Union,  France, \nGermany,  Japan,  Netherlands  and  the  United  Kingdom  (Appendix  3).  To  increase  the \neffectiveness of external assistance, and given the level of development of the education sector, \nsome  funding  agencies  are  piloting  provision  of  output-based  budgetary  support  for  specific \ngovernment  initiatives  for  primary  education.  This  may  be  a  precursor  to  broader  program-\nbased lending or may signal a shift to a mixed modality sector-wide approach. ADB is currently \nproviding technical assistance to undertake a comprehensive assessment for possible program \nassistance. However,  the  needs  for  teacher  training  for  US  and  PS  require  targeted  attention, \nparticularly  for  system-wide  curriculum  and  pedagogical  reform.  The  Project  provides  this \nsupport  and  will  help  prepare  this  subsector  to  be  better  equipped  to  benefit  from  evolving \nsector funding modalities. \n\n8. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n \n18. \nExtensive funding agency support to the education sector in Viet Nam, and ADB\u2019s own \nexperience  provide  important  lessons  for  maximizing  the  benefits  of  this  Project  and,  in  a  few \ncases,  for  avoiding  certain  risks.  While  the  benefits  found  are  consistent  with  those  outlined \nwithin the Project, the lessons relevant for the current Project are (i) overall project management \nquality is weak and needs to be strengthened so that project activities are undertaken in a timely \nmanner, and clear accountability guidelines need to be established and followed; (ii) the focus of \ntechnical assistance should be sharpened for building capacity of education staff and experts; \n(iii)  management  ability  for  education  and  training  needs  strengthening;  (iv) decision  making \nprocesses are slow; (v) staff within project management units change frequently; and (vi) project \ndesign should be clear (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nProject  preparation  was  guided  by  the  Government\u2019s  education  policies,  in-depth \n19. \nsituation  analysis,  and  a  review  of  lessons  identified  from  experience.  The  Project  places \nsignificant emphasis on (i) ensuring policy coherence for teacher development; (ii) strengthening \ncapacity  of  education  staff  and  experts  for  improved  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \nteacher  education;  and  (iii)  improving  access  for  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  has  detailed \ndesign  with  all  activities  clearly  described;  it  provides  for  strengthened  coordination  by  the \nproject authorities and the institutions responsible for delivery of project outputs. In addition, the \nProject  provides  for  an  international  expert  to  be  located  within  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU) to advise on project implementation in addition to other substantive tasks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2005.

The outcomes \nof  the  Project  will  be  (i)  improved  quality  of  US  and  PS  preservice  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining;  (ii)  expanded  access  for  ethnic  minorities,  particularly  women,  to  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment;  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of  teacher \ntraining  for  US  and  PS;  and  (iv)  improved  facilities  to  strengthen  instructional  capability  in  the \nTTIs. The Project will enhance access and equity, training quality, efficiency, and management. \nIt will help strengthen the national teacher development system to integrate preservice and in-\nservice training. The Project will provide targeted support to (i) TTIs in ethnic minority areas; (ii) \nethnic  minority  students,  particularly  women;  and  (iii)  TTIs  in  areas  of  high  enrollment  and  rapid \neconomic growth.  \n\nB.  \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nEnhance Quality of US and PS Preservice and In-Service Teacher Training  \n\nImprovement  in  the  quality  of  teaching  is  essential  for  producing  a  more  capable  work \n21. \nforce.  Education  must  meet  the  needs  of  a  rapidly  growing  economy  for  competent  problem-\nsolvers  who  are  imaginative,  adaptable,  and  creative.  To  accomplish  this,  the  changing  skills \nmix  required  of  school  graduates  must  be  reflected  in  the  way  teachers  are  trained.  This \nrequires new approaches, as most teachers continue to teach in traditional ways in which they \nthem  selves  were  taught.  The  inputs  integral  to  this  component  have  been  placed  under  two \nmajor  headings\u2014Preservice  Teacher  Training  and  In-service  Teacher  Training\u2014and  are \ndetailed below:  \n \n\na. \n\nPreservice Teacher Training \n\n22. \nAlignment of the Teacher-Training Curriculum with the School Curriculum. MOET \nwill develop guidelines, develop a training curriculum framework and to review current training \ncourses  to  reflect  the  changes  in  the  school  curriculum.  The  guidelines  will  establish  clear \nrequirements  for  review  to  determine  relevance  of  courses,  and  examine  the  need  for \nintroduction  of  new  courses,  especially  for  PS  education,  where  it  is  essential  that  all \nprofessional  school  subjects  be  covered  by  current  TTI  courses  and  where  the  employment \ncommunity  likely  to  absorb  PS  graduates  will  be  given  an  opportunity  to  contribute  curriculum \nideas.  Selected  TTIs  will  be  commissioned  to  develop  specific  course  outlines  for  all  subject \namendments and for new subjects. \n \n23. \nImprove  Content  and  Methodology  of  Training  Programs.  The  content  and  the \npedagogy  of  courses  will  be  improved  to  meet  established  accreditation  criteria.  To  improve \npedagogy, 20 6-month fellowships will be provided for staff to develop, trial, and document the \neffectiveness of new approaches to teaching, learning, and assessment. These fellowships will \nalso explore increased use of information technology in course design and delivery, and support \nan inclusive curriculum to address issues of ethnic minorities and gender. A common theme in \nthe  fellowships  will  be  the  development  of  more  active,  inclusive,  and  problem-solving \napproaches to teacher training. To develop new curriculum content, pedagogical guidelines, and \ncontact  teaching  requirements  for  20  pedagogical  courses,  MOET  will  contract  adequate \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nqualified  personnel  to  develop  the  20  courses  which  are  consistent  with  the  guidelines \ndeveloped and issued by MOET. \n \n24. \nProvide  Induction  Program  for  Beginner  Teachers.  Internationally,  the  first  year  of \nteaching is seen as a bridge between initial training and full registration. Many skills, attitudes, \nand  approaches  to  teaching  are  formed  during  the  teachers\u2019  first  year,  including  decisions  on \nwhether  their  career  will  be  in  teaching  or  elsewhere.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  supportive \ninduction program for beginner teachers\u2014to be conducted by DOETs and school principals\u2014to \nretain them in the teaching force, habituate them to high classroom standards, and induce self-\nconfidence.  \n \n25. \nEnhance  Use  of  Information  Technology  in  Preservice  Programs.  Accreditation \ncriteria  for  training  courses  will  require  that,  where  appropriate,  information  technology \napplications be incorporated in course design. As part of training in accreditation standards, TTI \nstaff will be assisted to use information technology applications within training programs. Each \nTTI  will  train  all  first-year  teacher  trainees  in  Microsoft  Word,  Microsoft  Excel,  and  Microsoft \nPowerPoint,  etc.,  so  that  they  use  these  skills  throughout  their  4  years  of  training.  This  will \nensure that all teachers are familiar with information technology and can increasingly use it to \nplan and evaluate their own and their students\u2019 performance.  \n \nDeveloping TTIs to serve as Lead Universities. Five TTIs will be provided support to \n26. \nserve as lead universities (LUs) and to develop professional partnerships with leading overseas \nuniversities. Consultants from the overseas universities will work with LU faculty for a total of 12 \nmonths in the LUs, helping design and implement new approaches to teacher training, including \nassessment of outcomes. As part of the training program, a faculty member from each LU will \nspend three months at the counterpart overseas university, observing teacher-training programs \nin  action.  Through  this  process,  it  is  expected  that  the  best  of  international  practice  will  be \nembedded in teacher training programs in Viet Nam, resulting in new pedagogical approaches \nbeing  adopted  by  teachers.  While  this  process  will  improve  course  design  and  teaching \nmethodologies within the LUs, each LU will, in turn, provide support to other TTIs by conducting \ntraining programs for staff and developing an improved curriculum. LUs need improved facilities \nand equipment to provide better quality of teaching with improved pedagogy. Under the Project, \neach LU will receive support for upgrading facilities and for additional key equipment. LU staff \nwill  also  receive  training  in  the  use  (and  maintenance)  of  enhanced  facilities  for  optimal \nimprovements in teaching methods.  \n \nThis component will have the following outputs: (i)  5,750 TTI  lecturers  will  benefit  from \n27. \n43  conferences  and  workshops  provided  to  outline  the  new  curriculum  and  approaches  to \nteaching;  (ii)  MOET  will  issue  new  curriculum  guidelines  and  three  conferences  will  be \norganized to cover 300 key TTIs across the country to familiarize them with the guidelines; (iii) \n20  pedagogical  courses  will  be  developed  conforming  to  new  MOET  guidelines;  (iv)  a  new \napproach  for  supporting  first-year  teachers  will  be  developed  and  included  in  the  training \nprograms  provided  for  DOET  staff  and  principals;  (v)  following  a  series  of  small  workshops  to \ndevelop subject-specific accreditation criteria, 120 workshops will be conducted for 600 TTI key \nstaff to outline new accreditation processes; and 150 key TTI staff will be trained and accredited \nto  teach  the  selected  courses,  which  will  result  in  all  first-year  trainee  teachers  undertaking \nindustry-accredited  information  technology  training;  and  (vi)  five  TTIs  will  receive  upgraded \nfacilities, equipment and staff fellowships for overseas training. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nIn-Service Training  \n\n28. \nProvide  a  National  Program  of  In-Service  Support  for  All  US  and  PS  Teachers. \nWhile  MOET  and  the  DOETs  will  retain  their  respective  management  role  in  the  provision  of \nprofessional  development  for  US  and  PS  teachers,  the  lead  universities  will  provide  the \nacademic  support  for  improving  in-service  programs.  With  improved  facilities  and  equipment, \nand  with  awareness  of  best  instructional  practice,  they  will  model  both  content  and  method  in \nthe in-service training courses they offer.  \n \n29. \nEnhance Relevance of Content and Methods in All US and PS In-Service Training. \nAs  with  preservice  programs,  in-service  courses  need  to  support  innovations  in  the  school \ncurriculum. An audit process will be established under the Project to identify changes needed in \ncourse  content  and  design,  and  to  accommodate  school  curriculum  revisions.  MOET  will \ndevelop  a  permanent  review  process  to  monitor  quality  and,  in  particular,  equity  and  gender \nissues  in  guidelines  designed  for  reviewing  current  in-service  training  courses.  Wherever \nappropriate, opportunities will be provided to industry to make inputs into curriculum, especially \nfor PS. \n \n30. \nDevelop Improved Training Programs for Teachers Working in US and PS Who Do \nNot  Meet  Professional  Requirements.  Among  the  many  teachers  who  do  not  meet \nprofessional  requirements,  approximately  3%  of  US  and  17%  of  PS  teachers  are  considered \nunderqualified. Training programs will be designed and provided for teachers who do not meet \nprofessional requirements to raise their competencies to desired levels. The new programs will \nbe aligned with the newly developed teacher profiles.  \n \n31. \nThese  interventions  will  result  in  the  following  outputs:  (i)  120  workshops  will  be \nconducted for 600 TTI key staff to outline new accreditation processes; (ii) 56 training programs \nfor 2,575 TTI staff and DOET officials will be provided to outline new approaches to in-service \ntraining  programs  and  teacher  support;  (iii)  new  guidelines  will  be  promulgated  and  used  in \nthese  training  programs;  (iv)  400  principals  and  DOET  officials  will  be  trained  in  the  new \naccreditation  processes;  and  (v)  100  courses,  each  of  60  days,  will  be  provided  for  9,000 \nunderqualified or unqualified teachers. \n \n\n2. \n\nExpand Access to US and PS Teacher Development  \n\n32. \nEthnic  minority  groups  are  underrepresented  among  US  and  PS  teacher  trainees,  with \nonly  4%  representation  among  US  teachers  given  a  population  share  of  13.7%.4 The  Project \naims to remedy this by providing targeted support to ethnic minority groups, particularly women, \nto expand their access to teacher training programs. \n \nExpand  Physical  Facilities  of  TTIs  in  Ethnic  Minority  Areas. Three regions have  a \n33. \ndisproportionately  higher  representation  of  ethnic  minorities:  North  West  (79%),  North  East \n(41%), and Central Highlands (33%). They exceed the national figure of 13.7%. In each of these \nregions,  the  projected  demand  for  additional  teachers  during  2005\u20132010  is  significant,  The \nNorth  West  needs  2,780  additional  teachers  or  68.2%;  the  North  East  needs  7,798  new \nteachers, or 47.4%; and the Central Highlands needs 5,927 new teachers, an increase of 79%. \nThe  pressure  on  the  TTIs  to  meet  this  projected  demand  is  high.  The  Project  will  support  six \nTTIs  located  in  predominantly  ethnic  minority  areas  that  cater  significantly  to  students  from \nethnic  minorities.  Of  these  six,  two  TTIs  train  US  teachers  and  four  TTIs  train  PS  and \n\n                                                 \n4   Exact figure for ethnic minority representation among PS teachers is not known.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\ninterdisciplinary  teachers.  The  Project  will  increase  the  capacity  of,  and  upgrade  facilities  in, \nstudent  dormitories  to  cater  to  increased  enrollment  of  ethnic  minority  students,  especially \nwomen;  increase  capacity  of  and  upgrade  facilities  in  student  canteens  supporting  the \ndormitories; and fund general improvements in facilities and equipment in selected TTIs. \n \n34. \nProvide  Scholarships  to  Ethnic  Minority  Students.  Scholarships will be provided to \nethnic minority students to relocate for teacher training; at least 50% of these scholarships will \nbe awarded to girls from ethnic minorities.  \n \n35. \nImprove Preparation and Bridging Courses. The quality of preparation courses needs \nto be improved to fill the gap between the skills acquired at school and the entry requirements of \nthe TTIs. The Project will provide inputs to help improve the content and design of the bridging \ncourses in the six universities identified for support to ethnic minority students to improve their \nacademic  content  to  keep  pace  with  the  improvements  in  TTI  curriculum.  Improved  bridging \ncourses  will  help  ethnic  minority  students\u2019  transition  to  a  more  challenging  academic \nenvironment. Upon completion of course design\u2014to the stage of accreditation\u2014the Project will \nsupport implementation of the recommended changes. \n\n36. \nThis  component  will  result  in  the  following  outputs:  (i)  six  TTIs  will  have  improved \nfacilities  and  upgraded  equipment;  (ii)  additional  dormitory  space  in  three  TTIs  with  enhanced \ncanteen facilities will be provided for students; (iii) 4,000 scholarships will be provided to ethnic \nminority  students  to  train  as  US  and  PS  teachers;  and  (iv)  new  preparatory  curriculum  will  be \ndeveloped  and  5,000  supporting  workbooks  developed  and  training  provided  to  450  TTI  staff \nthrough three conferences for implementing the new preparatory curriculum.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthen  Capacity  for  Planning,  Management,  and  Delivery  of  Teacher \nTraining for US and PS \n\n \nDevelop  a  Comprehensive  Framework  for  Teacher  Development.  Existing  policies \n37. \nand  procedures  for  teacher  management  and  assessment  systems  need  to  be  reviewed  to \nensure that all aspects of teacher development, from initial selection and training to career-long \nin-service  training,  are  coordinated  and  complementary.  Currently,  the  policies  for  teacher \ndevelopment  are  disparate  and  no  comprehensive  teacher  development  plan  is  in  place.  The \nProject will help MOET review policies related to teacher education; and clarify, consolidate, and \nmodify  these  as  necessary.  Following  the  review,  a  comprehensive  framework  for  teacher \neducation  will  be  developed,  supported  by  an  implementation  road  map,  which  will  address \ntraining,  career \nissues  of  preservice  qualifications,  recruitment,  deployment, \ndevelopment, etc.  \n\nin-service \n\n38. \nEnsure  Quality  Assurance  through  Accreditation  of  Training  Programs.  A  major \napproach  to  strengthening  the  quality  of  teacher  training  is  through  accreditation  of  all  TTI \ncourses. The Accreditation Board established to accredit all higher education courses has only \ninvolved  one  TTI  so  far.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the capacity  of  the  Accreditation  Board  to \nexpedite accreditation processes so that all TTI courses offered for US and PS teacher training \nare  accredited  by  content,  design,  time  allocated,  pedagogical  implications,  assessment,  and \nstaff  development.  Only  TTIs  conducting  accredited  courses  will  be  recognized  in  terms  of \nproviding qualified teachers. This is necessary to reduce unacceptable differences in the quality \nof  training  provided.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  strengthen  capacity  within  the  Accreditation \nBoard  to  accredit  at  least  10  TTI  courses  each  year.  MOET  capacity  will  be  strengthened  to \ndevelop  the  criteria  and  standards,  as  well  as  assistance  with,  the  initial  accreditation  of \npreservice  and  in-service  courses.  An  intensive  training  program  will  be  conducted  to  assist \n\n \n\n\fTTIs  in  redesigning  their  courses  to  meet  accreditation  requirements.  Through  a  process  of \nregular  reaccreditation,  courses  will  be  adapted  to  accommodate  new  knowledge  and \napproaches to teaching. To ensure course relevance to national and industry needs, the review \nand development of accreditation criteria and processes will be undertaken in consultation with \nstakeholders, including industry representatives.  \n \n39. \nStrengthen  Capacity  for  Education  Planning  and  Management.  MOET\u2019s  ability  for \neffective  planning  and  management  of  education  is  constrained  by  inadequate  information \nsystems  that  are  not  able  to  provide  accurate  and  recent  data  to  allow  analysis  of  trends  and \neffective  planning.  More  appropriate  and  sophisticated  databases  (segregated  by  gender, \nethnicity, location, etc. are needed to ensure quality, comprehensiveness, and consistency. The \nProject  will  (i)  strengthen  capacity  by  training  MOET  staff  on  data  collection  and  analysis;  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  education  management  information  system  (EMIS);  and  (iii)  develop  a  teacher \nmanagement information system (TMIS) (Appendix 4). Activities include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTrain  MOET  staff  on  data  analysis.  The  capacity  of  MOET  staff  will  be \nstrengthened for collecting and analyzing data to monitor emerging national and \ninternational trends, and provide MOET with policy options and advice. \nStrengthen  the  EMIS.  With  the  development  of  expanded  and  improved \ndatabases,  a  better  data  management  system  and  procedures  are  needed.  To \nundertake this task, an integrated computer-based system will connect all DOET \noffices and 31 TTIs with MOET to enable data collection and analysis, including \nreporting against relevant performance indicators. This will allow current human \nresource  management  systems  to  be  integrated,  facilitating  improved  human \nresource processes.  \nDevelop  a  TMIS.  While  the  annual  statistical  digest  contains  much  valuable \ninformation,  detailed  information  specific  to  US  and  PS  teacher  preservice  and \nin-service  training  is  more  difficult  to  find  and  is  located  across  a  number  of \ndepartments.  By  creating  a  TMIS,  relevant  and  rich  data  will  be  readily \naccessible. An improved interactive website with sufficient connectivity among all \n31  TTI  sites  and  MOET  and  DOET  offices  will  be  established  to  allow  for  data \ncollection and analysis. TTI staff will receive training to manage the database. \n\n \n40. \nDevelop  Teacher  Profiles  for  Enhancing  Teacher  Performance.  Education systems \nare  recognizing  the  centrality  of  teacher  performance  in  achieving  high-quality  outcomes  for \nstudents.  To  better  develop  teacher  effectiveness,  a  trend  is  to  develop  teacher  profiles  or \nstandards  that  identify  what  teachers  need  to  know  and  be  able  to  do  in  order  to  teach  more \neffectively. This method is being piloted under the World Bank\u2019s Primary Teacher Development \nProject to reward excellence and identify the professional development needs of teachers. The \nProject will build upon this pilot and extend it to US and PS teachers. Profiles will outline four \nlevels of performance: beginner teacher, teacher, key teacher, and senior teacher to cover three \nkey  areas:  knowledge,  skills,  and  attributes  required  to  be  highly  effective  teachers.  These \nprofiles  will  be  developed  and  piloted,  with  stakeholder  consultations,  in  the  nine  provinces \nwhere the beneficiary TTIs are located. The profiles will form the basis of teacher reviews and \nbe used to determine the relative effectiveness of teachers. This will also facilitate the planning \nof appropriate in-service support for all teachers. The development of the profiles will result in \nimproved quality assurance, as all teachers will have to meet defined standards, including first-\nyear  teachers  who  will  be  more  effectively  inducted  into  the  teaching  profession.  Through \ncontinual renewal of registration every 5 years, teachers will be obliged to attend accredited in-\nservice  programs  to  update  their  knowledge  and  skills.  A  national  registration  system  for \nteachers will be developed. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n41. \nTTI-Industry  Partnerships.  Increasingly,  industry  is  recognizing  the  benefits  of  TTI-\nindustry partnerships, which include the provision by industry of training programs licensed for \nTTIs  to  provide  to  students.  Students  who  complete  these  licensed  courses  gain  industry \naccreditation  at  various  levels.  This  process  ensures  that  trainee  teachers  are  up-to-date  in \nterms of industry knowledge and equipment. However, TTIs have indicated resource constraints \nfor  supporting  operational  budgets  for  effective  industry-TTI  collaboration.  To  help  overcome \nthis  constraint,  and  to  encourage  greater  use  of  industry-developed  programs  and  systems,  a \nsmall  grant  program  will  be  piloted  to  encourage  TTIs  to  forge  partnerships  with  industry  to \nprovide  industry-accredited  courses  as  part  of  teacher  training  programs.  The  grants  will  be \nprovided  to  those  TTIs  that  are  able  to  secure  partnerships  with  the  industry  to  offer  industry \naccredited  training  courses.  The  grants  are  intended  to  be  an  incentive  and  may  be  used  to \novercome  the  resource  constraint  for  meeting  counterpart  expenses  to  support  industry \naccredited  programs.  This  program  will  be  evaluated  annually  for  three  years  in  order  to \nmeasure the success of this innovation.  \n \nThis  will  result  in  the  following  outputs:  (i)  a  comprehensive  framework  for  teacher \n42. \neducation  with  a  supporting \nimplementation  road  map;  (ii)  new  accreditation  criteria \npromulgated and used to accredit all TTI pedagogical courses (10 courses will be accredited per \nyear during the Project); (iii) strengthened EMIS and TMIS systems, especially in relation to the \nregistration  of  teachers;  (iv)  network  capacity  connecting  31  TTIs  with  each  other  and  with \nMOET;  (v)  an  up-to-date  website;  (vi)  standards  of  performance  and  profiles  describing  the \nskills,  knowledge,  and  attributes  of  teachers  at  four  levels  developed  and  piloted;  (vii)  training \nprovided for 400 DOET officials and principals for use of new standards in all training programs; \n(viii)  a  national  registration  system  for  teachers;  and  (ix)  10  grants  of  $25,000  each  will  be \nprovided to 10 TTIs to forge partnerships with industry to deliver industry-accredited courses. \n \n\n4. \n\nImprove  Facilities  to  Strengthen \nTraining Institutions5 \n\nInstructional  Capability \n\nin  Teacher \n\n \n43. \nThe  aim  of  this  component  is  to  improve  facilities,  including  upgrading  equipment,  in \nselected  TTIs  to  support  the  goals  of  enhancing  quality  of  training  and  expanding  space  to \naccommodate the additional demands for teacher development.  \n \n44. \nDevelop Five TTIs as Lead Universities. LUs need improved facilities and equipment \nto  provide  better  quality  of  teaching  with  improved  pedagogy.  Under  the  Project,  each  LU  will \nreceive  support  for  upgrading  facilities  and  for  additional  key  equipment.  LU  staff  will  also \nreceive training in the use (and maintenance) of enhanced facilities for optimal improvements in \nteaching methods.  \n \nImprove  Facilities  for  Teacher  Training.  The  Project  will  support  expanding  and \n45. \nupgrading of facilities to support improvements in the quality of education as well as to expand \ncapability for training in select TTIs. Eleven TTIs will receive support to improve their facilities, \nmodernize  classrooms,  and  upgrade  equipment.  Each  of  the  selected  TTIs  will  be  provided \nsupport  for  (i)  expanding  and  modernizing  teaching  spaces  in  classrooms,  laboratories,  and \nworkshops  for  selected  existing  and  new  courses;  (ii)  acquiring  equipment  for  courses  as \nnecessary;  (iii)  upgrading  library  facilities;  and  (iv)  providing  short-term  training  in  the  use  and \nmaintenance of new equipment and facilities.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   Does not include the 5 TTIs covered under component 1 and  6 TTIs covered under component 2.  \n\n \n\n\fThe  component  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  6  TTIs  will  have  improved  facilities \n46. \nand upgraded equipment, and (ii) 300 staff will be trained to use new equipment and improved \nfacilities in line with new approaches to teaching and learning. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\n47. \nThe  Project  incorporates  a  number  of  distinctive  features  specifically  targeted  at \nproviding  systemic  support  necessary  for  sustainable  improvements  in  quality  of  US  and  PS \nteacher training.  \n \n48. \nCapacity  Building.  The  Government  will  be  assisted  in  reviewing  current  teacher \ntraining guidelines and developing a comprehensive framework for teacher development with a \nsupporting implementation road map. Institutional capacity will be strengthened by applying the \naccreditation system to teacher training programs, and supporting MOET to create a system for \nregistration  of  teachers.  The  outlining  of  the  skills,  knowledge,  and  attributes  required  for \ndifferent  levels  of  excellence  among  teachers,  through  creation  of  teacher  profiles,  will  place \nViet Nam among the leading nations in innovative teacher development strategies. An improved \nEMIS,  to  include  a  TMIS,  will  be  developed  to  strengthen  planning  and  management  of \neducation in general, and teacher development in particular.  \n \nQuality Improvement. The focus of the Project is on improving the quality of preservice \n49. \nand in-service teacher training. To ensure that the intended improvements occur, reconstructed \ntraining  programs  will  be  designed  and  regulatory  mechanisms  introduced  to  monitor \nimplementation. New initiatives to improve teacher quality include (i) a demonstrable alignment \nof  training  methods  with  declared  national  education  goals;  (ii)  an  accreditation  process  to \nensure quality of all training courses; (iii) registration processes for all teachers; (iv) formalized \nsupport  programs  for  first-year  teachers;  and  (v)  international  training  partnerships  to  improve \nteacher  training  pedagogy,  producing  US  and  PS  students  with  nationally  needed  skills, \nknowledge, and creativity. \n \n50. \ntechnology \ncompetencies  for  all  teachers;  all  teacher  trainees  will  be  certified  to  use  key  information \ntechnology programs and equipment. As technology\u2019s reach expands, teachers are expected to \nbe able to maximize the use of technology as a learning tool. \n \n51. \nImproved Links with Industry. Through the expansion of industry-TTI partnerships and \nthrough  industry  involvement  in  accrediting  selected  teacher  training  courses  to  meet  industry \nneeds, the relevance of US and PS to support national development goals will be enhanced.  \n \n52. \nSocial  Targeting.  To  attract  more  teacher  trainees  from  ethnic  minority  communities; \nimproved  bridging  programs  with  relevant  support  materials  will  be  offered;  student \naccommodation  will  be  provided  on  selected  campuses;  and  scholarships  will  be  offered  to \nethnic minority students, particularly girls, to pursue teaching as a career. \n \nD. \n \n53. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $43.18 million equivalent, including physical \nand  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and  duties  (Table  1).  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nfinance  works,  procurement  of  vehicles,  office  equipment,  consulting  services,  training, \nresearch,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  finance  charges  during  construction,  but  will \n\nInformation  Technology.

MOET  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project \ncoordination and implementation. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established within \nMOET  for  Project  implementation,  and  will  be  headed  by  a  Project  Director,  who  will  be \n\n \n\n\fsupported by a deputy director, and six assistants.6 MOET will establish and ensure adequate \nstaffing  of  the  PMU  by  loan  effectiveness.  The  PMU  Director  will  be  responsible  for  reporting \nprogress  of  the  project  to  the  Minister/Vice-Minister  on  a  regular  basis.  The  PMU  will  have \noverall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  including  procurement,  planning,  budgeting, \nmonitoring,  coordination,  and  reporting.  Each  beneficiary  TTI  will  also  establish  Project \nImplementation Units (PIU). The PIUs will be headed by a member of the TTI\u2019s Governing Body \nwho will be assisted by three staff. The PIUs will be responsible for implementation of Project \nactivities in their respective TTIs and will submit quarterly progress reports to the PMU. Based \non  past  experience  in  implementing  education  sector  projects  in  Viet  Nam,  the  financial \nmanagement  capability  of  the  EA  is  assessed  to  be  satisfactory.  Project  Management  Cells \n(PMCs), headed by an official of DOET, maybe established in project provinces for coordinating \nproject activities at the provincial level. Each PMC will report on a quarterly basis to the PMU.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n56. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  June  2007  to  June  2012.  The \nGovernment  has  given  assurance  that  adequate  budgetary  provision  for  the  Project  will  be \nincluded in the 2006/07 fiscal year budget. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n57. \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PMU,  in  close \ncooperation with relevant TTIs, will be responsible for all procurement.  NCB will be carried out \nensuring  consistency  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.    Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications  to  the  Borrower's  procedures  will be  documented  in  the procurement  plan  and/or \nupdated procurement plan. A procurement plan is at Appendix 7.  \n \nEquipment  and  Materials.  Supply  contracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $1  million \n58. \nequivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Supply \ncontracts for goods such as vehicles and computers (other than instructional materials) of less \nthan  $1  million  but  more  than  $100,000  will  follow  national  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nMinor  items  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  shopping.  Details  of \nprocurement  packages  and  technical  specifications  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  approval  before \nprocurement. MOET will take advance procurement action to expedite project implementation. \nADB\u2019s  concurrence  to  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  related  expenditure \nunder the Project or to finance the Project.  \n \n59. \nCivil  Works.  Project  works  comprise  construction  of  (i)  accommodation  and  canteen \nfacilities for an increased enrollment of trainees from ethnic minorities, particularly girls, at three \nTTIs;  and  (ii)  enhanced  instructional  facilities  and  equipment  (such  as  libraries,  information \ntechnology,  laboratories,  and  technical  hardware)  as  identified  at  the  selected  TTIs.  The \nestimated cost is $5.5 million, including design and construction supervision. The works will be \nspread over 14 sites with at least one site in each region. All civil works will be carried out using \nnational competitive bidding procedures.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6   In  areas  of  finance  and  administration,  procurement,  construction  and  civil  works,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \n\nteacher pre-service and in-service curriculum, and quality and accreditation of teacher profiles. \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n60. \nA total input of 132 person-months of international consulting and 492 person-months of \nnational  consulting  is  planned.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The consultants responsible for project \nimplementation, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation will be selected and engaged on \nan  individual  basis.  The  selection  and  recruitment  for  the  remaining  services  will  be  done \nthrough international firms using quality- and cost-based selection. The consulting services are \ndesigned  to  support  the  Project  as  well  as  build  longer  term  capacity  of  the  departments  and \ninstitutions responsible for the formulation of policy, and management and delivery of preservice \nand  in-service  teacher  training  for  US  and  PS.  The  consulting  services  cover  broad  areas  of \nexpertise including (i) policy reform, (ii) teacher education preservice and in-service curriculum \nand  instructional  material  design,  (iii)  accreditation  procedures,  (iv)  teacher  registration \nprocedures,  (v)  data  collection  and  analysis,  (vi)  information  and  communication  technology \ncurriculum,  (vii)  EMIS  development,  and  (viii)  facilities  and  equipment  improvement.  Indicative \nterms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  8.  Detailed  Consulting  Inputs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n61. \nThe Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) and policy relating \nto  combating  of  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism. 7  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the Government \nwill  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MOET  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n62. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency the Government will be required to disclose information about various matters on \nthe  Project,  including  procurement  related  to  the  Project,  on  MOET\u2019s  website.  With  regard  to \nprocurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on,  among  others,  the  list  of  participating \nbidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of \ncontract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured. Information regarding the criteria and \nprocedures for selection of candidates for scholarships will also be posted on the website. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n \n63. \nTo expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB funds for eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank designated by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The imprest account \nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019S  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). The imprest account ceiling and initial amount will not exceed \n$2,000,000.  Statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2003.

Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  will  not \nexceed  the  equivalent  of  $100,000.  Auditors  acceptable  to  the  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the \nimprest account and SOE; a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE \nshould be included in the annual audit report.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n64.  MOET, on behalf of the Government, will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nProject  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  Project  accounts, \nincluding financial statements, and SOE and imprest account records, will be audited annually \nby  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan \nAgreement.  The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on compliance with loan \ncovenants,  and  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under  ADB\u2019s  SOE  procedure  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. The independent \nexternal auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds. \n\n65. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit  them  to \nADB within 30 days of each quarter. The reports from the TTIs will be submitted to the PMU and \ncompiled  into  a  quarterly  report  to  be  submitted  to  MOET  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  in  English,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  will  indicate,  among  other  matters, \nprogress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous quarter, \nsteps  taken  to  resolve  problems,  compliance  with  financial  loan  covenants,  and  proposed \nactivities  for  the  succeeding  quarter.  Within  3  months  after  physical  completion  of  the  Project, \nthe  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project \nimplementation, accomplishments, and impact. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n66.  MOET  will  monitor  achievements  in  order  to  monitor  and  evaluate  implementation  and \ndevelopment impacts at various stages of the project cycle. Project performance monitoring will \nfocus  on  implementation  plans  and  targets,  and  their  fulfillment.  Performance  evaluations  will \nexamine the impact of interventions, problems and constraints faced, the reason for them, and \ntheir solutions. The TTIs will be responsible for submitting semiannual monitoring reports to the \nPMU,  and  for  evaluation  visits  and  studies.  MOET  departments  will  be  responsible  for \nsubmitting  the  necessary  information  to  be  established  as  project  monitoring  indicators  to  the \nPMU as required for semiannual monitoring reports and annual evaluation studies.  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n67. \nADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  difficulties  or  constraints,  and  help \ndetermine ways to overcome problems that arise during implementation. Ensuing reports will be \nprepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  PMU  and  TTIs  will  be  the  primary \ninformants  for  these  reviews.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  to  (i) \nreview  the  scope,  design,  and  project  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess  performance \nagainst  benchmarks  and  targets;  (iii)  review  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv) \nrecommend changes, if necessary, in project design or implementation. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nIV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  substantial  benefits  for  the  education  sector,  in  particular  for \n68. \nsecondary education. The systemic benefits to the sector will accrue from (i) a comprehensive \npolicy  framework  for  teacher  development;  (ii)  strengthening  of  the  accreditation  system  to \nensure the quality of teacher training programs; (iii) a teacher registration system; (iv) improved \ncapacity for planning and management of education through the development of an EMIS and \nTMIS,  including  piloting  a  program  for  developing  teacher  profiles;  (v)  enhanced  capacity  of \ninstitutions  responsible  for  training  US  and  PS  teachers;  and  (vi)  overall  improved  quality  of \nteachers.  \n \n69. \nThe secondary education subsector will benefit specifically from the Project. All TTIs will \nbenefit  from  improved  curriculum  and  pedagogy.  Seventeen  TTIs  will  receive  support  to \nmodernize and expand instructional facilities and equipment, so that in preservice and in-service \nprograms teachers are trained to provide improved quality secondary education, both in content \nand  methodology.  This  will  result  in  a  better  qualified  student  cohort  for  entering  higher \neducation, undertaking further training, or joining the workforce. The demand for better quality \neducation is created not only by Viet Nam\u2019s declared national development goals, but also by \nthe  expanding  economy  and  needs  of  industry,  business,  and  the  service  sectors  for  more \ninformed  and  skilled  workers.  To  develop  the  creative  problem-solving  skills  demanded  by \nemployers  for  international  competitiveness,  teaching  practices  will  shift  from  a  focus  on  rote \nlearning  to  active  student-centered  approaches,  preparing  them  to  add  value  to  the \neffectiveness  of  the  businesses  and  organizations  that  subsequently  employ  them.  To  ensure \nthat  curriculum  revisions  adequately  reflect  the  diverse  demands,  the  Project  will  hold \nconsultations  with  stakeholders  such  as  industry,  teacher  groups,  potential  students,  and \ncommunity representatives wherever appropriate prior to curriculum revision. \n \n70. \nThe Project will lead to an improved, better managed, and more efficient teacher training \nsystem.  By  creating  connectivity  between  institutions  and  establishing  a  standardized  course \naccreditation process, efficiencies will result and synergies realized through the sharing of best \npractices.  Efficiencies  will  also  be  achieved  centrally  as  new  management  procedures  are \ndeveloped  that  allow  data,  currently  stored  in  many  places  and  thus  difficult  to  access,  to  be \nreorganized  and  made  accessible  through  the  establishment  of  an  efficient  EMIS.  As  with  all \neducation systems, the loss of young teachers from the profession is a constant concern. This \nloss has many causes and is very costly, both economically and socially. Through the provision \nof a standardized high-quality support program for all first-year teachers, the resignation rate of \nbeginning teachers is expected to decrease.  \n \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project will be current and future US and PS teachers who \n71. \nwill have continuing opportunities to improve their professional competencies through improved \npreservice  and  in-service  training  programs.  The  Project-initiated  improvement  in  their \nprofessional  development  will  better  ensure  that  all  US  and  PS  students  are  provided  with  a \nschool  experience  that  contributes  to  life  choice,  employability,  reduction  of  poverty,  and \nachievement of national development goals. The indirect beneficiaries will be current and future \nUS and PS students who will benefit from instruction from a better qualified teaching force. \n \nInvestments  in  education  also  have  substantial  benefits  to  society.  Improved  teaching \n72. \nquality  leads  to  better  education  attainment,  which  in  turn  leads  to  higher  human  productivity, \ngreater  employability,  and  overall  better  opportunities  from  higher  incomes.  As  more  students \n\n \n\n\fcomplete  relevant  US  or  PS,  their  knowledge  and  skills  are  absorbed  by  the  community, \nincreasing  its  capacity  to  improve  social  conditions  for  all.  The  provision  of  highly  skilled \nteachers is central to the process of enhancing community skills and knowledge. An economic \nanalysis is attached as Appendix 9. \n \n73. \nThrough  increased  support  for  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  women,  educational \nbenefits  will  accrue  to  these  communities  through  greater  educational  success  by  ethnic \nminority  teachers.  This  will  also  serve  as  an  incentive  to  increase  the  percentage  of  ethnic \nminority  students  to  complete  secondary  education.  Increased  access  for  ethnic  minority \nstudents  will  help  reduce  current  disparities  between  ethnic  minority  groups  and  the  general \npopulation,  promoting  greater  social  equity  and  cohesiveness.  Four  thousand  ethnic  minority \nstudents,  at  least  half  of  whom  will  be  women,  will  benefit  directly  through  scholarships  to \npursue teacher training. With increased education, income-earning capacity will rise and gains \nto  society  will  accrue  through  improved  indicators  of  social  development.  A  social  poverty \nimpact  analysis  is  in  Appendix  10,  and  a  gender  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan  in \nAppendix 11.  \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards  \n\nB. \n \n74. \nThe  Project  will  involve  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  existing  TTI  facilities,  with  no \nnegative environmental or resettlement impact. No land acquisition or resettlement is required. \nSome new classrooms will be added to existing TTIs, but on land already owned by the TTIs. \n\nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n75. \nThe  Project  is  designed  in  support  the  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  and  high \npriority  to  improving  education  to  achieve  its  economic  goals.  Therefore,  the  Government  will \ncontinue to support efforts to improve the quality of education, of which teacher education is a \nkey concern. The Project was prepared with extensive consultations with government and TTIs, \nwhich  agree  on  and  support  proposals  contained  in  the  Project.  However,  several  areas  of \nconcern  could  affect  project  performance  and  outputs.  The  risks  identified  occur  within  the \ncontext  where  the  size  and  scope  of  the  Project,  involving  31  TTIs  with  17  identified  for \nupgrading  of  facilities  including  five  for  improvement  as  lead  universities,  give  the  Project \nconsiderable  complexity  and  magnitude.  A  summary  of  risks  and  mitigating  circumstances \nfollows. \n \n76.  Management Capacity. The major project risk emanates from the number of institutions \nto  be  supported  by  the  Project  by  a  combination  of  hardware  and  software  inputs  that  will \nrequire  considerable  PMU  management  capacity  to  ensure  project  inputs  within  the  time  lines \nand resources outlined. The Project mitigates this risk by requiring that the PMU and beneficiary \nTTIs establish coordination committees to regularly monitor progress and take timely measures \nto  address bottlenecks and  delays.  Experience  indicates  that  weak  management  capacity  can \nalso result in delays in the provision of software. The Project mitigates this risk by providing an \ninternational  expert  to  be  located  within  the  PMU  to  assist  with  project  management  and \nimplementation issues.  \n \n77. \nPolicy  Formulation.  Any faltering of commitment to review difficult and complex policy \nissues  related  to  teacher  development,  including  recruitment,  deployment,  standardization  of \nthe \nqualifications,  and  career  development,  will \nGovernment  is  strongly  committed  to  improving  education  quality,  and  supports  the  review  of \nexisting policy statements and development of a comprehensive policy framework.  \n\nformulation.  However, \n\nimpact  policy \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nfacilities  and  creation  of \n\nSustainability.  Expansion  of \n\ninformation \ninstitutional \n78. \nmanagement  systems  to  support  education  and  teacher  management  will  require  postproject \noperation and maintenance costs. Adequate budgetary provision will need to be made to ensure \nmaximization  of  benefits  through  properly  maintained  facilities  and  updated  databases. \nAdditional resources will be needed for periodic upgrading of training curriculum and in-service \ntraining,  as  determined  by  the  policy  review.  The  Project  will  generate  continuing  additional \nincremental costs of $1.5 million annually after the Project. A number of commitments, however, \nwill terminate at the end of the Project, and hence will not be an ongoing burden on the budget. \nThe most important ongoing financial commitments will be in meeting the base costs of annual \nsupplies, materials, power, etc. required to support the operation of the additional facilities and \nequipment provided under the loan, and their continuing maintenance expenses. Given the size \nof  the  annual  operation  and  maintenance  component  of  the  education  budget,  of  more  than \n$250 million equivalent,8 the continuing liability would add less than 0.6% annually to the total. \nThis is feasible and sustainable, given the Government\u2019s commitment to educational expansion \nand development.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n79. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \nMOET will create a project website to disclose information about various matters \non  the  Project,  including  procurements  related  to  the  Project.  With  regard  to \nprocurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on,  among  others,  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured. \nIn order to develop new curriculum content, pedagogical guidelines, and contract \nteaching  requirements  for  pedagogical  courses,  MOET  will  contract  with \nappropriate providers to develop the courses and will ensure that these courses \nare consistent with the guidelines developed and issued by MOET. \nTo  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project,  the  Government  and \nMOET  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  gender \nstrategy contained in the Gender Action Plan that has been prepared and agreed \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB.  Specifically,  the  Borrower  and  MOET  will \nensure that under Component 2 (b), priority is given to girls from ethnic minorities \nwith the aim being that girls receive at least 50% of the scholarships. MOET will \ninclude in its annual reports to ADB details about information dissemination and \nany  other  efforts  being  made  to  achieve  a  50%  scholarship  ratio  for  ethnic \nminority girls. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  Project  is  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), in order to increase \nthe quality and access to US and PS teacher development received by the ethnic \n\n                                                 \n8   It was D3,889 billion in financial year 2002.  \n\n \n\n\f(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nminorities. In particular the Government will ensure that ethnic minorities receive \nall the benefits described under component 2 of the Project. \nThe  sites,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  TTI  facilities  upgrading  and \nconstruction works undertaken under the Project will be implemented in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002).  \nThe Government and MOET will ensure that the rehabilitation or construction of \nthe new TTI facilities will not involve involuntary resettlement according to ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). To be eligible for support the TTI will be \nrequired to confirm that no land acquisition or resettlement is required under the \nProject. Construction of new classrooms will be added to existing TTI facilities on \nunoccupied land already owned by the TTI. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB. \n\n80. \n\nThe following condition will be met before the loan becomes effective: \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will have established a PMU and will have appointed a project \ndirector,  a  deputy  project  director,  and  all  of  the  agreed  key  technical  and \naccounts and finance assistants.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n81. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  22,874,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \nNam  for  the  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n24 November 2006 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         President \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nImpact: \n \nImproved quality of \nsecondary education  \n \n\n \n \n\u2022  Successful \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  Ministry of \n\n \nAssumption \n\u2022  Government \n\nEducation and \nTraining (MOET) \nreports \n\ncommitment to \neducation remains \nstrong \n\nOutcome \nOutcome: \n\u2022  Improved quality of \nupper secondary and \nprofessional secondary \npre-service and in-\nservice teacher training \n\u2022  Expanded access to \nteacher training for \nethnic minority \nstudents, particularly \ngirls.   \n \n\n \n \n\u2022  MOET reports \n \n\u2022  EMIS/TMIS \n \n\u2022  Impact \n\nassessment \nstudies \n\n \n\u2022  Project reports \n \n \n\nintroduction of \nsystemic \nimprovements aimed \nat improving quality \nsuch as updating and \naccreditation of \ntraining courses, \ndeveloping teacher \nprofiles and \ninstitutional \nstrengthening.  \n\n \n \n\u2022  31 Teacher Training \nInstitutions (TTIs) \nbenefit from improved \ncurriculum and training \nof academic staff \n\u2022  5 TTIs are developed \nas lead universities \nwith improved facilities \nand enhanced \ncapability for \npedagogical research \nand innovation  \n\n\u2022  12 TTIs have improved \nfacilities and updated \nequipment, including 6 \nin ethnic minority \ndominated areas. \n\u2022  4000 ethnic minority \nstudents, including \ngirls have opportunity \nto become US and PS \nteachers \n\nOutputs \n1.

It comprises 5 years of primary; 4 years of lower secondary; and 3 or \n4 years when students attend either upper secondary (US) (3 years) or professional secondary \n(PS)  (3  to  4  years),  or  attend  separately  run  vocational  training  institutes  for  1  to  3  years. \nEducation  administration  is  shared  by  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments,  and \ncommunes, with central decision making and decentralized implementation. The great majority \nof  formal  education  and  training  is  publicly  provided  through  state\u2013run  schools,  colleges, \nuniversities,  and  training  centers.  However,  a  small  number  of  nonpublic  institutions  operate, \nespecially schools and preschools. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall \nresponsibility for education and training, but while it manages higher education institutions, the \nprovinces  manage  US  and  PS  schools;  and  cities,  districts,  and  communes  manage  lower \nsecondary, primary, and preschool education. The Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs \nhas  specific  responsibilities  for  vocational  training.  This  pattern  is  not  uniform  across  the \ncountry, especially as the policy of promoting greater decentralization of management and fund-\nraising in the public sector takes effect. \n \n2. \nDuring  the  last  10  years,  the  number  of  students  enrolled  in  public  schools  has  been \nincreasing.  Primary  education  is  nearly  universal,  with  a  net  enrollment  rate  at  97%.  The \nsecondary  participation  rate  is  rapidly  expanding  with  the  lower  secondary  education  rate \ntargeted  to  reach  90%  by  2010.  Two  strands  of  formal  education  available  after  lower \nsecondary,  US  and  PS,  are  usually  conducted  in  separate  schools  by  separately  trained \nteachers, and are managed by the provinces under the aegis of MOET. US is the much larger, \nacademically focused stream accounting for 86% of enrollments; while PS is more practical and \nvocationally  oriented  accounting  for  14%  (the  Government  is  taking  steps  to  increase  PS \nenrollment). Both can lead to university and college entry, and enrollments in both are growing rapidly.  \n \n3. \nWhile enrollments in US and PS are increasing at much the same rate, the same cannot \nbe said for two key ingredients in their provision, namely, the number of schools and the number \nof teachers. In neither strand has the growth in the number of schools kept up with the increase \nin  student  enrollment.  The  number  of  US  schools  almost  doubled  during  1995/96  to  2003/04, \nthe  number  of  PS  schools  in  2003/04  was  almost  the  same  as  in  1995/96.  Teacher  numbers \nkept pace with student numbers in US, but grew only sluggishly in PS.  \n \nThe enrollment rate for US increased an average of 12% per year between 1995\u20131996 \n4. \nand 2003\u20132004, but is predicted to fall from a high of 14.61% in 2005 to 4.79% in 2010. For PS, \nincreases averaged 11% per year between 1995\u20131996 and 2003\u20132004, with a 4.9% increase in \n2005. Enrollments are projected to rise to 14.6% in 2010. Official figures indicate that enrollment \ntrends showed sharp increases in the latter half of the previous decade, but declined in the early \nyears  of  this  decade;  most  of  the  growth  since  the  mid  1990s  has  been  in  the  US,  PS,  and \npostsecondary education subsectors. In fact the higher the level of education, the sharper the \nenrollment  increase;  this  is  partly  due  to  the  already  high  participation  rates  for  primary \neducation. For US and PS, these increases will require an additional 47,824 US teachers and \n10,594  PS  teachers  to  be  trained  during  2005\u20132010,  an  approximately  44%  increase  in  the \nnumber of teachers required if current student/teacher ratios are to be maintained (Table A2).  \n \nFemale  teachers  comprise  56%  of  US  teachers  and  45%  of  PS  teachers,  however  no \n5. \navailable  data  breaks  down  this  information  by  region  and  field  of  training.  About  97%  of  US \nteachers are fully qualified, while only 83% of PS teachers are. Mountainous and remote areas \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nhave a shortage of qualified teachers. In highland areas, up to 50% of the teachers have been \nreported to be not fully trained. While ethnic minorities make up 13.75% of the population, only \n3.5% of US teachers are from an ethnic minority. No data is available for PS. \n \nUS  and  PS  enrollments  are  unevenly  distributed  by  household  income,  ethnic  group, \n6. \nand  urban  or  rural  area.  A  gap  exists  between Kinh  and  Chinese  residents  groups  and  ethnic \nminority  groups  in  school  enrollment,  with  the  enrollment  rates  of  45.2%  and  19.3%.  Children \nfrom  the  poorest  quintile  are  enrolled  at  the  rate  of  only  a  quarter  of  the  richest  quintile.  Girls \nand boys in rural areas, where most ethnic minority groups live, are less likely to attend school \nthan those in urban areas. The reasons for different enrollment rates include the direct cost and \nopportunity  cost,  low  parental  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  long-term  investment  in  child \neducation, and sociocultural obstacles especially the practice of old customs including the early \nmarriage of girls.  \n \n7. \nEnrollment of ethnic minority students has risen sharply, increasing by 60% from 1999 to \n2004.  However,  they  still  remain  underrepresented  at  9.4%  of  total  enrollments  against  a \npopulation  share  of  13.7%.  Several  measures  are  continuously  being  applied  to  facilitate  the \naccess  of  ethnic  minorities  to  higher  education,  including  preparation  in  boarding  schools, \nadmission without  entrance  examinations,  lower  standards  to  pass  the  examinations,  offers of \nscholarships,  and  waiving  of  tuition  fees.  Attention  is  also  being  given  to  improving  female \nstudents\u2019 enrollment rates although the gender gap in US enrollments is not significant. \n \n8. \nSteady economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.5% in \nthe last decade, and the Government\u2019s strong commitment to education have resulted in public \nexpenditure on education claiming a higher percentage of GDP (increased from 3.5% in 1996 to \nan estimated 4.6% in 2004) than any other country in the region except Malaysia and Thailand. \nExpansion  of  education  can  also  be  gauged  from  the  annual  increases  of  over  19%  in  wages \nand  salaries  compared  with  less  than  13%  annual  growth  for  the  pubic  sector  as  a  whole.  A \ngreater proportion of the education budget goes to capital expenditure for US and PS than on \nother subsectors. The majority of funds available for teacher training are public funds, with little \nprovided by the private sector. Education is still very centralized, with teacher training the most \nhighly centralized subsector.  \n \n9. \nQuality of education remains a serious concern, particularly in remote and mountainous \nregions.  Surveys  conducted  by  funding  agencies  indicate  the  following  causes:  (i)  limited \ninfrastructure, (ii) inaccessibility, (iii) language and culture barriers, (iv) lack of adequate number \nof  qualified  teachers,  and  (v)  the  perception  that  returns  to  education  are  low.  Lack  of  well-\neducated  youth  among  ethnic  minorities  has  direct  implications  not  only  for  poverty  reduction \nthrough lack of employability but also for social issues such as population, health care, human \nresources  for  local  governance,  and  other  community  development  issues.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  need  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  education  and  increase  access  for  both  males \nand females to achieve the development objective of increasing the proportion of the labor force \nthat is skilled and trained to 30% by 2005, and to 40% by 2010. In addition professional training \nfor youth in rural areas needs to be intensified. The Education Development Strategic Plan for \n2001\u20132010  specifically  refers  to  the  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching  by  fostering \ninnovative  teaching  methods.  The  plan  also  refers  to  the  need  for  quality  assurance  by \nstrengthening the accreditation system. The Project supports the major suggestions contained \nin  the  plan  for  improving  the  quality  of  US  and  PS  by  improving  the  quality  of  teachers.  An \nanalysis  of  the  quality  and  management  issues  in  the  education  sector  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nTable A2:

The Project will (i) \nenhance  training  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and  management;  (ii)  help  strengthen \nthe national teacher development system to integrate preservice and in-service training; and (iii) \nprovide  targeted  support  to  teacher  training  institutes  (TTIs)  in  ethnic  minority  areas;  ethnic \nminority students, particularly women; and TTIs in areas of rapid economic growth.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  goal  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  teacher  training  for  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment, which will lead to improvements in the quality of US and PS. Improvements in the \nquality of education are likely to produce a better educated and more productive work force; and \nlead to greater demand  for education, thereby increasing the number of employable educated \npeople. Better skills will lead to higher incomes, which in turn will lead to greater consumption, \nleading to greater demand for goods. It will also result in greater investments in family welfare \nthrough  enhanced  access  to  education  and  health.  The  latter  will  have  an  intergenerational \nimpact through a continuous process of improvements in human resources. \n \nEconomic  benefits  will also  accrue  from  efficiency  and  productivity  gains  as  a  result  of \n3. \nproject inputs. The Project will result in a modernized teacher training curriculum, and improved \nteaching methodologies. About 220,000 student teachers are expected to benefit from improved \ntraining  curriculum  and  pedagogy  during \nthe  Project.  Since  curriculum  changes  and \nimprovements in pedagogy extend beyond the life of the Project as does enhanced capacity of \nthe  TTIs  through  staff  development  and  periodic  accreditation  requirements  for  training \nprograms,  benefits  will  continue  to  accrue  to  future  students  of  TTIs  as  well.  With  improved \nteaching,  retention  rates  will  increase  and  dropout  rates,  already  low,  will  fall,  resulting  in  a \ngreater  number  in  the  population  having  more  employable  skills.  In  addition,  knowledge  and \nskills  transfer  will  be  more  effective,  leading  to  increased  learning  and,  subsequently,  better \nacademic  performance.  Improved  skills  and  knowledge  will  lead  to  higher  productivity  and \nincreased economic competitiveness. The plan for improved support for first-year teachers will \nincrease retention rates of graduate teachers, which translates to lower future hiring and training \ncosts. In addition, this impacts the quality and effectiveness of teaching.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nProject  beneficiaries  can  be  categorized  as  those  who  stand  to  gain  directly  and \nimmediately  from  the  project  interventions;  and  those  who  benefit  in  a  less  direct,  but \nnonetheless substantial, manner. \n \n5. \n  \n\nDirect Beneficiaries. These include  \n\nProject Beneficiaries \n\n(i) \n\nacademic  staff  and  management  of  the  TTIs:  (a)  at  all  31  TTIs  through  the \nactivities under component 1; and (b) at the 17 participating project TTIs through \nfacilities support provided under components 2 and 4; \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\napproximately 220,000 potential student teachers over 5 years attending US and \nPS  training  courses  at  TTIs,  through  activities  designed  to  improve  preservice \ncourses, under components 1, 2, and 4; \napproximately  120,000  current  US  and  PS  teachers,  of  which  4,500  are  from \nethnic  minorities,  through  activities  designed  to  improve  in-service  courses  at \nTTIs, under components 1, 2, and 4; \n4,000  students  from  ethnic  minorities,  at  least  half  of  whom  are  expected  to  be \nwomen,  through  the  activities  designed  to  improve  access  to  teacher  training \nunder component 2; and \nteacher  training  system  administrators  in  MOET,  through  activities  conducted \nand  support  provided  under  component  3  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  plan, \nmanage, administer, and regulate the system. \n \n\nIndirect Beneficiaries. These include  \n\n6. \n \n\nstudents  in  US  and  PS  schools,  both  currently  and  in  the  future,  through  being \ntaught  by  better  trained  and  motivated  teachers:  (a)  lower  repeat  and  dropout \nrates; and (b) more relevant and employable attitudes, skills, and knowledge; \nemployers  and  potential  employers:  (a)  recruits  with  more  relevant  and \nemployable attitudes, skills, and knowledge; (b) less need for costly initial training \nof recruits and/or greater returns from what they undertake; \nhigher  education  institutions:  better  prepared  applicants,  lower  first-year  failure \nrates, and less need for costly bridging courses; \nGovernment treasury: lower repeat and dropout rates in TTIs and in US and PS \nmean  more  effective  use  of  scarce  public  funding  directed  at  the  education \nsector. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n \n7. \nBenefits of the reforms and quality improvements in US and PS teacher training will also \nextend to a population of US and PS school students that is already almost 3.3 million strong \nand growing rapidly. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  social  benefits  from  the  poverty  reduction  effect  of  the  Project  will  be  significant. \nApproximately 29.1% of project costs are aimed directly at increasing enrollment and improving \nretention rates for ethnic minority students. The increase in ethnic minority students, particularly \nethnic minority women, training as teachers through the provision of increased accommodation \nto support scholarship recipients will help overcome current disparities between ethnic minority \ngroups  and  the  general  population.  The  provision  of  new  preparatory  course  curriculum  for \nethnic  minority  students  and  the  training  of  staff  for  an  increased  understanding  of  the  issues \nand challenges faced by ethnic communities will provide social benefit as more TTI staff as well \nas teacher trainees will have an appreciation of the needs of disadvantaged groups and adopt \nmore  effective  pedagogy  within  an  improved  curriculum.  Six  TTIs  located  in  predominantly \nethnic  minority  areas  will  receive  support  for  enhanced  facilities  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding,  leading  to  long-term,  sustained  benefits  for  ethnic  minority  populations  with  benefits \nthat  will  extend  far  beyond  the  project  cycle.  Also,  as  more  students  complete  relevant  US  or \nPS,  their  knowledge  and  skills  are  absorbed  by  the  community\u2014increasing  its  capacity  both \nnationally  and  locally  to  improve  social  awareness  of  important  development  issues  of  direct \nrelevance to communities, such as environmental conservation, health, sanitation, and hygiene. \nThe provision of highly skilled teachers is central to the process of enhancing community skills \nand knowledge.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nSocial  benefits  from  investments  in  secondary  education  are  high.  A  better  educated \n\n \n9. \npopulation, particularly women, leads to multiple, intergenerational benefits to society: \n \n\nAs  education  levels  rise,  people  tend  to  have  fewer  children  leading  to  slower \npopulation growth. \nEducated  parents  tend  to  place  greater  value  on  education,  investing  a  higher \nproportion of resources in the education of their own children. \nEducated  women  avail  of  access  to  health  services  more  than  their  lesser \neducated counterparts leading to improved family health. \n\n(iv)  Women\u2019s  education  is  directly  correlated  with  improved  nutritional  standards \n\nwithin households. \nEducated mothers not only allocate more household resources to education and \nhealth,  but  also  reduce  gender  disparities  in  intrahousehold  allocation  of \nresources.  \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe Project will generate continuing additional incremental cost of $1.5 million annually \nafter the Project. Table A9.1 indicates the estimated level and category of the annual financial \ncommitments  required  of  the  Government  over  the  life  of  the  Project.  Expenditures  peak  in \nyears  2  and  3  at  around  $2.8  million,  and  thereafter  settle  at  approximately  $1.5  million  per \nannum. A number of these commitments, however, will terminate at the end of the Project, and \nhence  will  not  be  an  ongoing  burden  on  the  budget.  The  most  important  ongoing  financial \ncommitments  will  be  in  meeting  the  base  costs  of  annual  supplies,  materials,  power,  etc. \nrequired  to support  the operation  of  the  additional  facilities  and  equipment  provided  under  the \nloan,  and  their  continuing  maintenance  expenses.  Given  the  size  of  the  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance  component  of  the  education  budget,  of  over  $250  million  equivalent, 3  the \ncontinuing liability will add less than 0.6% annually to the total. This is feasible and sustainable \ngiven  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  educational  expansion  and  development.  Moreover, \nsome  project  gains,  particularly  those  that  strengthen  capacity;  improve  the  curriculum, \nclassroom  assessment,  and  examination;  and  improve  teacher  competencies;  will  have  long-\nterm beneficial impact and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. Government \nexpenditures on education have risen steadily (Table A9.2).  \n\n                                                 \n3   It was D3,889 billion in financial year 2002. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nStaff replacement\n\nSubtotal (A)\n\nB.

However, \n11. \nwith increased economic activity and targeted Government support for the poor, the increases in \nschool  enrolment  are  expected  to  be  sustained.  Fiscal  impact  analyses  were  conducted  to \ndetermine  the  effect  of  project  costs  on  Government  budgets,  and  the  projected  costs  have \nbeen built into future Government budget projections. Viet Nam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \nhas grown rapidly in recent years, and the size of the Government\u2019s budget has grown with it. \nTable A9.2 shows that public expenditure has maintained its share of GDP over the last decade. \nAt  the  same  time,  however,  the  share  of  public  spending  on  education  and  training  has \nincreased, from 14% in 1994 to just over 17% 10 years later, and this in turn has meant that its \nshare  of  GDP  has  increased  a  whole  percentage  point.  This  meant  that  by  2002  public \nexpenditure on education and training in Viet Nam claimed a higher percentage of GDP than in \nany  other  country  in  Southeast  Asia  except  Malaysia  and  Thailand.  This  increase  in \nGovernment  commitment  to  education  provides  evidence  that  the  planned  improvements \nassociated with the Project will be supported and sustained over time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nTable A9.2: Total Public Expenditure, and Expenditure on Education and Training \n(as a percentage of GDP) \n\nPercent \n\n1994 \n\n1998 \n\nPublic expenditure share of GDP \n\n25.1 \n\nPublic expenditure on education \nand training share of GDP \nEducation and training share of \npublic expenditure \n\n3.5 \n\n14.\n0 \n\n20.3 \n\n3.5 \n\n17.4 \n\n2000 \n\n23.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n15.1 \n\n2002 \n\n24.9 \n\n4.2 \n\n2004 est. \n\n26.9 \n\n4.6 \n\n16.9 \n\n17.1 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources:  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2004.

These  objectives  are  consistent  with  those  outlined  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \nstrategy and program update 2000\u20132006 for Viet Nam. The education goals and objectives include \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\ncontributing  to  and  maintaining  economic  growth,  and  reducing  the  poverty  rate  through  increased \nemployment and job creation;  \nincreasing labor time use and productivity; and \nachieving universal lower secondary education for the entire population and improving education quality for \nall  at  all  education  and  training  levels,  with  particular  attention  to  poor  and  ethnic  minority  student  group \nneeds. \n\n(Source: Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, 2002; Ministry of Education and Training [MOET], 2001; National Committee \nfor Advancement of Women in Vietnam, 2000; Education Development Strategy and policy measures, MOET, 2001, \n2003) \n \nThe labor market is characterized by  a clear shortage of qualified  workers. The need for improved access to higher \neducation and professional training for young women and men, especially in rural and mountainous areas, is strong. \nThe average percentage  of  workers  who have finished US is  still very low  (18.4%)  with the rate  of females (17.3%) \nbeing  lower  than  that  of  males  (19.5%).  The  five  geographic  regions  of  the  North  East,  Central  Highlands,  South \nCentral  Coast,  South  East,  and  Mekong  River  Delta,  have  a  US  completion  rate  that  is  less  than  half  that  of  some \nother regions. \n \nThe  average  percentage  of  the  labor  force  with  professional  certificates  and  vocational  skills  is  also  low  at  3.9% \n(females at 4.2% and males 3.3%), especially for the Mekong River Delta, North West, South East, and South Central \ncoast.  (Source:  Survey  Results  on  Jobs  and  Labor  Situation,  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs,  7/2002; \nCentral Institute for Economic Management [CIEM], 2003.).  \n \nIn  the  current  professional  training  structure,  only  1.0%  of  current  workers  are  university  graduates  and  2.7%  have \ntechnical certificates. This is much lower than the national goal of 10% for graduates and 15% for those with technical \ncertificates.  \n \nIn  the  agriculture  sector,  where  17  million  workers  are  currently  employed,  the  proportion  of  local  agricultural  senior \nmanagement staff with a PS degree is low at 27.7%; 34.5% have a vocational training certificate, which does not meet \nthe sector development needs (Nguyen Thi Tuoc 2003). Within the professional and management levels of the rural \nworking population, only 3.9% have access to PS, and the percentage of working people with a university degree is \nvery low. \n \nIn  the  highlands  and  mountainous  areas,  the  education  level  and  trained  skills  of  workers  is  much  lower.  The \ncorrelation between ethnicity and lack of educational opportunities is high with the number of ethnic minority students \ncompleting  schooling  well  below  that  of  nonethnic  minorities.  US  and  PS  teachers  from  ethnic  minority  groups \ncomprise only 4% of the teacher population compared with an expected 14%. \n \nDuring the last decade, the net enrollment rate for US increased by an average of 12% per year with the average rate \nof graduates from US schools being 89.9%. The Government\u2019s target participation of US school-age children is 45% \nby 2005 and 50% by 2010; recent data indicates that these targets are being met and even exceeded.  \n \nPS (vocational) has been expanding but faces a number of challenges in meeting the requirements of a growing labor \nmarket and development goals. PS needs to be strengthened to address the national development plan\u2019s skilled labor \nneeds. A better balance is needed between US and PS. Improvements are needed for professional training structures \nand access for rural and poor students to training institutions and PS schools in both urbanized higher growth areas, \nas well as in rural and mountainous areas, especially for students from ethnic minorities. The general target set is by \n2005, 10% of the vocational age population will participate in vocational training schools, rising to 15% by 2010. This \nwill require a transition from lower secondary schools to vocational schools to reach 10% in 2005 increasing to 15% in \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10         \n\n50 \n \n\n2010. High-skill vocational programs and the planned building of additional PS schools has meant that the 2005 target \nhas  been  met  and  budget  projections  for  increased  teacher  numbers  will  allow  slightly  more  than  15%  of  senior \nsecondary students to study in vocational schools by 2010. While PS provision will continue to expand at an average \nrate of 15% over the next 5 years, the expansion rate for US enrollments will slow to an average of 8% over the same \nperiod.  This  will  adjust  the  balance  between  US  and  PS  education  so  that  more  students  will  have  access  to \nvocationally focused programs.  \n \nThe need to upgrade the quantity and quality of the educational system is widely recognized, and to increase access \nfor both male and female students to achieve the Government\u2019s development objectives and targets. The Project will \naddress  these  concerns  through  increased  support  and  improvement  to  the  preservice  and  in-service  teaching \nprograms,  improved  capacity  and  facilities  in  some  teacher  training  universities,  and  improved  management  of \nprograms  by  MOET  and  department  of  education  and  training  offices.  The  Project  has  a  very  strong  focus  on \nuniversities  in  remote locations,  which  will receive support to increase  and improve facilities so that poorer students \nhave  improved  opportunities  to  train  as  US  and  PS  teachers.  While  much  of  the  focus  will  be  in  support  of  ethnic \nminority  students,  the  correlation  between  these  groups  and  poverty  is  high,  and  as  such,  the  Project  will  focus \nsignificant  resources  to  addressing  this  issue.  The  Project  will  promote  and  apply  active  measures  leading  to  more \nequal access to both US and PS for girls/women and boys/men, and take into account the special needs of training \nboth female and male students to be teachers and lecturers, especially the target groups of poor and ethnic minority \ngroups. \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n                                                                                          \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPopulation  and  Labor  Force.  Viet  Nam  has  a  population  of  approximately  83  million  (2005),  with  an  expected \naverage annual growth rate of around 1.1% over the next decade. In 2003, 31% of the population was under the age \nof 15 and significant percent was in the working age from 15\u201364 years. The urban population accounts for 25.8% with \nan average growth rate of 4.2%, and rural growth accounts for 74.2% with an annual growth rate of 0.6%. Agriculture \nis  still  the  major  employer  in  the  economy,  accounting  for  67%  of  the  total  labor  force  in  2001  (Source;  General \nStatistics Office, Hanoi at www.GSO.gov.vn). Viet Nam has undergone rapid economic development and growth over \nthe last decade. The gross domestic product (GDP) has improved with an average GDP per capita in 1999 of $360, \nrising to $480 in 2003.  \n \nThe  human  development  situation  varies  considerately  across  the  country  (Source:  National  Center  for  Social \nsciences and Human sciences of Viet Nam, 2001, ADB, 2001), with large inequalities in the degree of industrialization, \nwhich are reflected and pronounced on a per capita basis (Source: GSO, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, \n2002).  The  gap  of  inequality  in  income  per  capita  seems  to  be  widening  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  Income \ndisparities  have  been  widening  also  between  regions  and  ethnic  groups  with  the  most  vulnerable  groups  including \nethnic minorities, the rural poor, and unregistered migrants in urban areas.  \n \nPoverty:  From 5%\u201310%  of the population is estimated to still be  vulnerable to falling into poverty. (Source: Poverty \nTask Forces, 2002).The poverty distribution  is uneven across geographic  regions and  areas. In rural areas, in  2002 \nthe average rate of poverty was very high at 35.6%, while the rate of urban poverty was much lower at 6.6%. In rural \nareas,  poverty  and  the  vulnerability  of  falling  into  poverty  are  more  pronounced.  This  is  especially  true  for  some \nremote,  disaster-prone  mountainous  regions  that  have  a  high  concentration  of  ethnic  minority  groups  such  as  the \nnorthern  mountains,  especially  the  North  West,  Central  Highlands,  North  Central  Coast,  and  South  Central  Coast \nregions.  \n \nThe two main better-off urban areas, the Red River Delta and South East regions while having high growth also have \nhigh  poverty  densities  as  a  result  of  increased  urbanization.  In  the  rural  areas  of  the  North  West  and  North  Central \nCoast, poverty density is lower because of the relatively smaller populations. The challenge is to provide appropriate \nsupport for the poor, both in large cities and rural and mountainous areas.  \n \nEthnic  Minority  Group  Incidence  of  Poverty.  In  Viet  Nam,  53  ethnic  minority  groups  make  up  13.8%  of  the  total \npopulation. Their situation is complex as many groups are small in number and often confined to a specified location. \nEthnic  minority  group  concentration  in  each  region  varies  considerably.  In  the  North  West,  North  Central  Coast, \nCentral Highlands, and South Central Coast regions, where ethnic minority groups are more concentrated, the poverty \nrate and vulnerability are highest. The rate of poverty among ethnic minority group households is 69.3% higher than in \nother  social  groups  such  as  the  Kinh  and  those  of  Chinese  origin  where  the  poverty  level  is  23.1%.  For  Kinh  and \nChinese groups, the poverty gap is 4.7%, while for the other ethnic minorities it is 22.8% (Source: GSO, 2002). Ethnic \nminority  groups  also  have  varying  levels  of  deprivation  and  food  poverty.  The  poverty  among  them  is  reducing  at  a \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nslower  rate  than  with  the  general  population  (ADB  2004),  and  the  share  of  ethnic  minorities  among  the  poor  has \nincreased  from  20%  (1993)  to  30%  (2002),  with  a  recent  forecast  that  this  share  could  go  as  high  as  37%  by  2010 \nusing a new poverty standard index.  \n \nThese trends present a major challenge for the country. A statistical forecast of the poverty rate by 2010 indicates that \nethnic minorities will be the hard core of poverty in Viet Nam. (VDR 2004). \n \nPoverty  among  ethnic  minority  groups  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to  education  and  training \nopportunities.  The  quality  of  education  is  a  wide  social  concern,  but  is  a  particular  concern  in  remote  and  ethnic \nminority  mountainous  areas.  The  main  reasons  are  lack  of  infrastructure,  inaccessibility,  language  and  cultural \nbarriers,  lack  or  limited  quality  of  teachers,  curricula  that  are  not  suitable  to  localities,  perceptions  that  returns  from \neducation  are  low,  and  low  household  affordability  (United  Nations  Development  Program  and  Partnership  for \nTransparency  Fund  2002,  Department  for  International  Development  and  Partnership  Transparency  Fund  2002, \nVietnam Development Report 2004). Distance becomes an important factor in relation to access to US and PS for the \nrural poor and for providing opportunities for the rural poor to train as teachers. \n \n\nC.

Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender  issues:  All  geographic  regions  are  characterized  by  a  gender  imbalance  and  disparate  trends  in  both \naccessing senior secondary education and training opportunities especially in specialized fields. Females have a lower \nincidence  of  schooling  than  males,  and  people  in  rural  areas  have  lower  completion  rates  than  in  urban  areas.  Of \nstudents completing schooling, ethnic minority students, especially females, are still underrepresented.  \n \nAmong  females  workers  17.3%  have  completed  US,  15.2%  have  a  professional  or  technical  qualification,  and  3.9% \nhave  a  college  diploma  or  university  degree.  This  compares  with  males  with  19.5%,  20.6%,  and  4.5%  respectively. \nThe  rates  are  lowest  in  the  North  West,  North  East,  Mekong  River  Delta,  and  Central  Highlands  (Source:  Survey \nresults on job and labor situation, Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, 7/2002; CIEM 2003). \n \nThe issue in relation to the rate of female participation in teacher training indicates that appropriate numbers of women \nare  teachers,  but  a  significantly  lower  number  of  women  teach  in  universities  and  women  are  less  represented  in \ncertain  fields  of  teaching  specializations.  In  relation  to  teacher  training,  a  very  small  number  of  US  and  PS  teacher \ntrainees  are  from  ethnic  minority  groups.  Equity  and  gender  equality  issues  need  to  be  better  integrated  and \naddressed,  especially  ethnic  minority  issues,  in  official  education  and  training  policies,  teacher  training  program \ndevelopment, and project activities.  \n \nThe Project will positively contribute to meeting these needs through a range of targeted activities and improvements \nto central policies and practices. The Project will support selected US and PS teacher training institutes (TTIs) in all \ngeographic  regions  throughout  Viet  Nam,  concentrating  on  TTIs  in  the  most  isolated  regions.  Specific  activities  and \nprograms will be targeted at the integration of gender issues and equity concerns into the programs conducted by all \nproject  universities.  Training  curriculum  review  will  specifically  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  fully  captured  in  the \ntraining. Specific activities include the need to effectively address gender and ethnic minority education concerns as \nkey  issues  that  must  be  positively  addressed  as  part  of  the  accreditation  process  for  all  preservice  and  in-service \ncourses;  the  provision  of  scholarships  to  allow  poor  ethnic  minority  students  to  train  as  teachers;  the  building  of \nadditional  student  dormitories  targeted  for  ethnic  minority  students,  particularly  women;  and  the  review  and \nstrengthening of bridging courses for ethnic minority students and targeted staff training. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\fE.

Affordability assessments during the design \nphase indicate no risk that the poor will be marginalized in \nterms of ability to access resources and benefits.  \n\nNo risks are associated with labor policy, law, or broader \nlabor issues.  \n\nSpecific actions to ensure benefits will accrue to \nethnic minorities are included in the project design. \nThe Project provides targeted support to ethnic \nminorities, particularly women, to expand access to \nteacher training programs. Three TTIs with high \nethnic minority enrollments will receive support to \nupgrade facilities, improve equipment, and increase \nstudent accommodation. Scholarships will be \nawarded to 4,000 ethnic minority students and \ncurrent preparatory courses for ethnic minorities will \nbe reviewed and new courses developed. \n \nNone  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11       53 \n\nGENDER AND ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n \n\n1. \nThe  Upper  Secondary  and  Professional  Teacher  Development  Project  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  goals  by  improving  the  quality  of  secondary  education  through \nextensive support for teacher education for both general upper secondary (US) and professional \nsecondary  (PS)  levels.  The  Project  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  producing  a  better \nqualified and more productive work force. The Project aims to (i) improve the quality of US and \nPS  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training;  (ii)  expand  access  to  US  and  PS  teacher \ndevelopment;  (iii)  strengthen  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of  teacher \ntraining for US and PS; and (iv) improve facilities to strengthen instructional capability in teacher \ntraining  institutes.  The  Project  will  enhance  training  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement.  The  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  supports  the  project  objectives,  and  highlights \nspecific actions that will be integrated during implementation. Specific targets will be developed \nfurther at the start of the Project. The GAP was prepared according to Viet Nam regulations and \neducation  guidelines,  and  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  (1998).  While  the  Project  provides  targeted  support  to  increasing \nparticipation  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  some  additional  actions  are  reflected  in  the  GAP  in \naccordance to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).   \n \nA. \n\nBackground \n\n2. \nSecondary education is divided into two subsectors: (i) US provides general education; \nand  (ii)  PS  education  has  a  major  focus  on  technical  and  vocational  training.

The  social  benefits  from  investments  in  secondary  education,  especially  for  females, \nlead to multiple and intergenerational benefits to society (Appendix 9). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nB. \n\nLegal  Framework  for  Achieving  Gender  Balance  in  Education  Development  in \nDisadvantaged Areas \n\n4. \nThe Government supports conditions, guidelines, and policies for promoting social equity \nand  gender  equality,  and  prioritized  programs  for  ethnic  minority  development  to  ensure  the \npreservation of their diverse cultural identities and languages. The legal framework for ensuring \nequity  and  gender  equality,  including  access  to  education  and  training,  is  well  integrated.  For \ninstance,  see  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  2001\u20132010; \nEducation  Development  Strategy,  2001\u20132010  (Ministry  of  Education  and  Training,  2001); \nEducation  for  All  Plan,  2003;  National  Strategy  for  Women  Advancement  to  2010  (NCFAWS, \n2002);  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2006\u20132010;  and  draft  Gender  Equality \nLaw (currently being considered by the National Assembly, 2006). \n\n5. \nThe  development  objectives  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth \nStrategy  include  (i)  achieving  better  education  for  all,  (ii)  ensuring  gender  equality  and \nempowerment  of  women,  (iii)  reducing  vulnerability,  and  (iv)  eradicating  poverty  while \npreserving the cultural identity of ethnic minority groups. The strategy considers implementation \nof the education plan \u201cwith equity and higher quality for all, especially for ethnic minority groups\u201d \nas one of the most important concerns and decisive factors for poverty reduction.  \n\nThe  Strategy  for  Education  Development  for  2001\u20132010  includes  special  measures  for \n6. \npromoting equity, and addressing gender and ethnic minority issues in education and training, \nsuch as (i) apply measures for reducing the gender gap in access to education and training; (ii) \nwork out special incentives for encouraging more women and girls in remote, rural, and ethnic \nminority  areas  to  attend  schools;  and  increase  percentage  of  female  students  in  upper \neducation boarding schools; and (iii) overcome gender bias and stereotypes in school textbooks \nto promote more equal opportunities in education and training.  \n\nIn  achieving  the  goal  of  implementing  gender  equality,  women\u2019s  advancement,  and \n7. \nchildren\u2019s  rights  and  protection  within  the  education  and  training  sector,  especially  for  ethnic \nminority  groups,  the  following  objectives  are  clearly  stated:  (i)  implement  successfully  the \nNational Strategy for Women Advancement to 2010; (ii) find the measures for ensuring women\u2019s \nequal  access  to  education,  training,  and  in-service  professional  skills  upgrading;  (iii)  apply \nincentives  to  encourage  female  students  in  remote  rural  areas,  especially  for  ethnic  minority \nfemales in US, in boarding schools, colleges, and universities; apply supporting policies for poor \nwomen/girls  in  education  and  training;  (iv)  include  measures  for  readjusting  and  overcoming \nsex-disaggregated  trends  in  the  field  of  training  and  education,  integrating  gender  issues  into \nthe  professional  orientation  programs  and  training;  and  review  and  improve  quality  of  schools \ntextbooks and get rid of old gender perceptions, bias, and stereotypes; (v) apply measures for \nincreasing the number of female managers and women in leadership positions in all education \nlevels;  (vi)  create  education  promotion  funds  for  females,  and  define  the  female  targets  to  be \nachieved  in  all  education  and  training  levels  and  retraining  and  upgrading  skills  courses;  and \n(vii)  strengthen  the  education,  propaganda,  and  social  advocacy  for  raising  awareness  and \nresponsibilities of state agencies, institutions, households, and individuals for promoting gender \nequality.  \n\nC. \n\nGender Action Plan \n\nSpecific actions, as outlined in the GAP (Table A11.2), will be implemented and refined \n\n8. \nas required.
