The  development  objectives  set  out  in  the  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (KDP), \n2016\u20132019  are  inclusive  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  along  with \nimproving  education  and  health  services,  governance,  and  infrastructure.3 The  KDP  is  aligned \nwith  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018  for  Kiribati;4 Pacific  Approach,  2016\u2013\n2020; 5 and  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 6 \nIneffective  governance  arrangements  have  contributed  to  the  deterioration  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s \nsewerage  network.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU),  the  implementing \nagency  for  the  current  project,  is  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  policy, \nplanning, and regulation, but has insufficient capacity and resources. The Public Utilities Board \n(PUB)  is  responsible  for  sewerage  services,  but  has  insufficient  resources  and  cannot  charge \nfor services. \n \n4. \nThe  current  project  is  financed  by  ADB,  the  Government  of  Australia,  the  Multi-Donor \nTrust  Fund7 under  the Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and  the  Government  of  Kiribati  to \nsupport improvements to the health of communities in South Tarawa. Development coordination \nand cooperation between ADB, the cofinanciers, and the government is strong. Current project \nfinancing  is  $23.10  million.  On  17  October  2011,  ADB  approved  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to SDR4,700,000 ($7.56 million equivalent) and administration of grant cofinancing of \n$13.95  million  equivalent  from  the  Government  of  Australia  (footnote  2).  The  Government  of \nKiribati  is  providing  counterpart  financing  of  $0.98  million  equivalent.  The  loan  and  grant \nagreements were signed on 3 May 2012 and declared effective on 1 June 2012. The ADB Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility provided additional financing \nof $0.61 million on 14 May 2014.8 The expected project completion date is 30 June 2019, and \nthe loan and grant closing date is 31 December 2019. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2011.

Additional Cofinancing \u2013 Proposed Administration of Grant to Republic of Kiribati: \n\nSouth Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project. Memorandum. 14 May (internal). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe current project encountered initial delays because of significant capacity constraints \n5.  \nwithin  MPWU  and  the  executing  agency,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development \n(MFED).  This  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  Kiribati  Fiduciary  Services  Unit  (KFSU)  within \nMFED.  MPWU  recruited  an  international  project  technical  advisor  to  support  the  project \nimplementation unit within MPWU, as well as ensure effective project monitoring and evaluation. \nThe  project  steering  committee,  the  National  Infrastructure  Development  Steering  Committee, \nmeets regularly to review project implementation progress and to address issues. \n \n6. \nproject was performing well as of the second quarter (Q2) of 2016.9 \n \n\nThe project performance rating has consistently been on track since January 2015. The \n\n(i) \n\n(b) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The status of the expected outputs are as follows: \nOutput 1 intends to engage the community in order to improve sanitation \n(a) \nand hygiene practices among South Tarawa\u2019s population. Of the 11 local \npeople engaged as community mobilizers, eight are women. Through the \nuse of these community mobilizers, the project has successfully engaged \nSouth Tarawa communities and the public. A recent review of community \nsurvey  data  indicates  a  marked  improvement  in  hygiene  practices  and \ncontinued  effort  to  advocate  a  user-pays  principle  to  recover  water \ncharges. \nOutput 2 comprises improvements to the existing sanitation infrastructure. \nThis  includes  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Bairiki,  Betio,  and  Bikenibeu \nsaltwater and sewerage systems and upgrading works on three sewerage \noutfalls.  The  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  civil  works  package \nfor sewerage systems (ICB01) has been ongoing since August 2014. The \nocean sewerage outfall civil works package (ICB02) had been delayed by \nrebidding and a redesign of the due diligence required for the work to fit \nwithin  the  budget.  The  contract  was  awarded  in  July  2016.  MPWU  had \nconsidered  using  sludge  digesters  in  ICB01,  but  opted  to  procure \nconventional  drying  beds  instead  as  a  variation  through  the  ICB01 \ncontract.  Procurement  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  April  2017. \nDiscussions  are  ongoing  on  establishing  an  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) contract for up to 5 years following completion of both civil works \npackages.  The  request  for  quotation  for  two  on-site  sanitation  pilot \npackages  was  issued  on  1  July  2016.  These  packages  are  being \nevaluated  and  are  expected  to  be  awarded  by  September  2016.  These \non-site sanitation pilot packages form the first of two candidate subproject \ngroups.  This  pilot  program  aims  to  provide  39  households  with  on-site \nsanitation  systems,  such  as  septic  tanks  with  system  support,  and \nundertake quarterly effluent and compost quality monitoring program over \na  2\u2013year  period.  An  international  sanitation  engineer  and  a  national \nsanitation  engineer  have  been  recruited  to  implement  the  program.  The \npilot  program  for  the  second  subproject  group  is  expected  to  proceed \nprovided there is sufficient funding. Output 2 is anticipated to be delivered \nas  expected,  ensuring  that the  PUB  effectively  manages the  wastewater \nin South Tarawa. \nOutput 3 comprises capacity building for MPWU and PUB to improve their \nability  to  plan  and  manage  water  and  sanitation  services.  The  capacity \n\n(c) \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2010.  Additional  Financing:  Enhancing  Development  Effectiveness.

Manila (para. 3). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f(d) \n\n(e) \n\ndevelopment  component  made  substantial  progress  during  the  first  3 \nyears  of  project  implementation.  Training  activities  under  the  capacity \ndevelopment  plan  have  been  reviewed  and  discussions  are  ongoing  on \nfurther maintenance and asset management training following completion \nof the physical works. \nOutput 4 involves the creation of a dedicated sanitation maintenance fund \nunder  MPWU.  The  fund  will  be  available  to  PUB  to  finance  sanitation \nO&M  as  well  as  the  determination  of  the  tariff  structure.  The  project  will \nset  up  $0.74  million  in  grant  funds  for  sanitation  maintenance.  The \ngovernment has concurred with the policy and governance arrangements \nfor establishing the fund. A significant delay occurred when replacing the \nfinancial advisor to support the establishment of the fund, but that position \nhas  now  been  filled  and  will  provide  continued  support  to  MPWU. \nComplementary to the current project, the Pacific Regional Infrastructure \nFacility has provided technical assistance (co-led by ADB and the World \nBank)  to  advise  the  government  on  utility  services  reform,  including  a \nreview  of  the  tariff  structure. 10  The  revised  design  and  monitoring \nframework  proposes  to  change  the  time  frame  for  activities  under  this \noutput to align them with the current status. This output is not yet due. \nOutput 5 is efficient and effective project management provided by MFED \nand  MPWU.  The  KFSU  ensures  effective  project  coordination,  and \nfiduciary and procurement support. The project implementation unit within \nMPWU  provides  direct  project  implementation  support.  MPWU  also \nrecruited  a  consultant  technical  advisor  to  provide  effective  project \nmanagement.  Physical  work  is  on  track  and  planned  for  completion  by \nApril 2017. \n \nSatisfactory \nimplementation  progress.  Progress  on  contract  awards  is \nsatisfactory as one of the two major civil works packages is being implemented. \nOverall  civil  works  contract  administration  is  being  routinely  monitored  by  the \nsupervising  engineer. The  contract for  project  management  and  implementation \nservices was awarded on 5 June 2012 for $4.1 million and A$1.0 million (totaling \n$5.2 million equivalent). As of July 2016, the current contract amount was about \n$6.7  million  because  of  variations  related  to  additional  design  and  staff  inputs. \nThe ICB01 contract was awarded on 31 August 2014 for $5.2 million. With 55% \nof the project time elapsed, the cumulative contract award is 60% ($12.7 million) \nand disbursement is 44% ($9.3 million). \n \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  Compliance \nwith  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  management  plans  and  the \nenvironmental  licenses  for  ICB01  is  satisfactory.  The  Ministry  of  Environment, \nLands  and  Agriculture  Development  (MELAD),  which  carries  out  routine \ncompliance monitoring, has not reported any major issues. The ICB01 contractor \nroutinely  monitors  its  compliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP);  the  consulting  engineer  also  checks  and  audits  such  compliance.  The \ncontractor\u2019s health and safety performance was found to be of best practice. The \ncontractor  has  implemented  its  HIV/AIDS  prevention  program  and  has  engaged \nin community and village cleanup initiatives. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Establishment of the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility Coordination \n\nOffice. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSuccessful management of risks. The project has managed and mitigated the \nrisks  identified  during  processing  and  implementation.  As  such,  the  successful \nimplementation of the project is not threatened by major risks. Nonetheless, the \nroad infrastructure investment that is being undertaken concurrently still presents \na  coordination  risk  related  to  underground  servicing  work.  Measures  adopted \ninclude  regular  project  coordination  briefings  ahead  of  work.  Risks  are  further \nreviewed during administration review missions. \n \nOn track rating. The project\u2019s performance was rated on track as of Q2 2016. \n\ninadequate \n\ninformation  was  considered \n\n \n7. \nAdditional  financing  is  needed  because  costs  were  underestimated  and  the  ocean \nsewerage outfalls package required a redesign. At project inception, the consulting engineers of \nthe  project  implementation  unit  reviewed  the  preliminary  designs  and  background  reports  that \nhad  been  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.11 They  discovered  that \nthe  design  reports  for  pumps  and  infiltration  galleries  needed  improvement.  The  drawings,  for \nexample, did not indicate any details about service hole and pipe locations, sizes, and depths. \nfor  environmental  assessment  purposes. \nThe \nSignificant  work  was  involved  in  reviewing  and  producing  detailed  design  drawings  and  bid \ndocuments,  and  obtaining  environmental  approvals.  The  bid  documentation  was  only \nconsidered conceptual, largely because the design reports and the details of the drawings were \ninadequate.  As  a  consequence,  an  additional  12  months  were  required  to  prepare  the  bid \ndocuments for the core subprojects. \n \n8. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  ICB01  at  project  appraisal  was  $5.9  million  (A$6.0  million \nequivalent);12 following  the  consulting  engineers  review  and  detailed  design,  the  cost  estimate \nincreased  to  $6.8  million  equivalent  (A$6.9  million).  The  approved  contract  award  value  was \nA$7.9 million ($7.4 million equivalent), 31.7% more than the appraisal estimate and 8.2% above \nthe  designers\u2019  revised  estimate.  The  overall  shortfall  totals  $1.24  million  (A$1.33  million \nequivalent).13 Increases  were  primarily  related  to  mobilization,  insurance,  and  general  costs \n(A$2.6  million);  and  differences  in  prices  of  most  items  (e.g.,  rehabilitation  and  installation  of \npump  stations,  construction  of  service  holes).  Work  is  ongoing,  and  the  current  approved \nvariation  totals  A$0.7  million  for  installation  of  valves,  connections,  risers  and  surface  boxes, \nand  hydrants,  as  well  as  the  replacement  of  the  Bikenibeu  saltwater  tower.  A  systematic \nassessment  of  the  condition  of  these  assets  found  that  the  identified  network  assets  have \nsignificant corrosion and must be replaced. \n \nThe ICB02 contract to rehabilitate the three ocean sewerage outfalls proposed horizontal \n9. \ndirectional drilling as the preferred construction methodology. The cost estimate for this package \nat  project  appraisal  was  $4.0  million  (A$4.1  million  equivalent)  (footnote  12).  Four  bidders \nresponded  with  bid  prices from  A$7.5 million  ($6.7 million  equivalent)  to A$17.1  million  ($15.3 \nmillion equivalent),14 or 67.5%\u2013327.5% above the engineer\u2019s estimate. The bids were indicative \nof  the  high  risks  that  the  market  placed  on  the  remote  and  inaccessible  country,  and  the \narduousness  of  the  work  site.  An  independent  review  concluded  that  horizontal  directional \ndrilling  is  not  recommended  because  of  unknown  geotechnical  conditions  and  the  uncertainty \nregarding  consistency  and  ease  of  drilling  through  the  reef.  In  view  of  the  high  bid  prices,  the \ntender  was  canceled  in August  2014. The  engineer  recommended  changing the  design to the \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.

The \nestimated  costs  cover  general  establishment  costs,  outfall  replacement,  and  larger  diameter \npipes.  A  temporary  outfall  pipeline  would  be  required  at  each  outfall  location  to  maintain  the \nexisting flows of wastewater. \n \n10. \nThe ICB02 retendering process took 18 months. The process involved a detailed marine \nsurvey and design, an environmental assessment and public consultations, bid documentation, \nand tender evaluation. Following the tender evaluation, the contract award was awarded in July \n2016 for A$6.9 million ($5.2 million equivalent).15 \n \nThe  current  project  meets  all  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing16 because  it  (i) \n11. \nremains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (paras. 17\u201318); (ii) is a \nhigh priority of the government, which has included the investment in the KDP; (iii) retains the \noriginal  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  current  country  partnership \nstrategy for Kiribati (footnote 5). The current project has faced challenges, but no major change \nin the design and implementation arrangements was required. The current project performance \nhas been rated on track since Q1 2015. Additional financing is a suitable modality to make sure \nthat  (i)  the  overall  project  is  successfully  completed  by  the  current  loan  closing  date,  (ii)  the \ntargets  and  indicators  of  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  are  successfully  achieved,  and \n(iii) the project development objective is met. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  will  not  change.

ICB01  includes  the  rehabilitation  of  the  saltwater  system,  service  holes, \nsewerage  systems,  pump  stations,  electrical  and/or  controls  equipment,  saltwater  towers,  and \nintakes.  Saltwater  pipeline  cleaning,  jetting,  and  restoration  in  Betio  is  completed;  cleaning, \ninspection,  and  repair  of  the  sewerage  system  is  ongoing.  Work  on  the  elevated  tanks  and \ntowers is ongoing. The Betio saltwater tank has been refurbished and recoated with corrosion-\nresistant  epoxy.  The  other  towers  in  Bairiki  and  Bikenibeu  are  due  for  replacement.  The \nsaltwater  tower  at  Bikenibeu  is  dilapidated  and  will  be  demolished  and  replaced.  The  Bairiki \ntower  was  demolished  and  work  has  begun. Work  on  pumping facilities has  started  in  parallel \nwith the ongoing reticulation upgrades. Work on the ocean sewerage outfalls has not started. \n \n\n                                                 \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  reevaluated  based  on  the  higher  cost  estimates. \nThe  revised  economic  internal  rate of  return  is  estimated  at  12.7%  (from  16.1%  in the  original \nappraisal), which is considered acceptable as it exceeds the 10.0% economic opportunity cost \nof capital adopted for the analysis.19 The high economic internal rate of return can be attributed \nto  expected  improvements  in  productivity  resulting  from  reduced  incidences  of  mortality, \nparticularly of infants and children under 5 years of age, and from the avoided near-term risk of \na  serious  outbreak  of  potentially  fatal  diseases  such  as  cholera.  The  financial  analysis \nconcluded that the project is sustainable based on the government\u2019s commitment to (i) introduce \ntariffs to cover sewerage O&M costs along with service delivery improvements; and (ii) establish \nthe sanitation maintenance fund to ensure that adequate funds are available to cover the O&M \ncosts of the sanitation system in the short to medium term. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment, \n19. \nconducted in Kiribati in 2010, indicated that public financial management is weakened by (i) lack \nof  fiscal  discipline,  (ii)  nonretirement  of  advances,  (iii)  lack  of  financial  reconciliation  between \nMFED  and  the  line  ministries,  (iv)  lack  of  effective  expenditure  commitment  controls,  and  (v) \noutdated  legislation  and  regulations. 20 Since  that  assessment,  ADB  and  other  development \npartners  have  assisted  the  government  in  designing  and  implementing  the  Kiribati  Public \nFinancial Management Plan, 2011\u20132014.21 Improvements in public financial management have \nbeen noted, and plans are in place to update the public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment in 2017. \n \n20. \nThe  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  current  project  will  continue  for  the \nadditional financing. MFED will continue to be responsible for the overall financial management \nof  the  project,  and  a  full-time  qualified  project  accountant  will  continue  to  handle  all  financial \nmanagement  activities.  The  project  will  continue  to  use  direct  payment  and  imprest  fund \ndisbursement procedures, and all required audits will be carried out. For the current project, no \naudited  project  financial  statements  are  overdue  and  no  financial  management  issues  are \npending. All four audited project financial statements were submitted early and were issued with \nunqualified opinions. \n \n21. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MFED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \n22. \nProcurement.  KFSU  has  assisted  MPWU  in  procuring  all  project  goods,  works,  and \nservices under the current project, with close oversight by ADB. Initially ADB administered the \nselection  of  project  management  and  implementation  consultants.  The  coordination  between \nKFSU and MPWU is ongoing. \n\n                                                 \n19 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Government  of  Kiribati.  2010.

Unpublished. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nThe  current  project  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  provide  social \nbenefits through improved sanitation and hygiene practices, and enhanced access to improved \nsanitation  among  South  Tarawa\u2019s  population.  This  is  expected  to  result  in  significant  health \nimprovements, higher productivity, and lower expenditures on medical treatment. \n \n24. \nThe project serves the port area of Betio, a prostitution hub, where there is considerable \nrisk  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV  transmission. While  the  current  HIV  prevalence \nrate in South Tarawa is reported to be low, the port is a hub for international fishing vessels and \nabout 30% of the population has a sexually transmitted infection. The current project carries out \nan  HIV  prevention  program  for  the  contractor\u2019s  employees  and  communities  near  the  project \nsite. \n \n25. \nGender.  The  current  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Most  project \noutputs have specific gender design features to facilitate women\u2019s participation in, and access \nto,  project  benefits. The gender  action  plan  aims to  ensure that  any  potentially  harmful  effects \non  women  are  avoided, with  specific  actions that  will  allow  women  to  benefit from the  project. \nThe  gender  action  plan  includes  awareness  and  behavior  change  campaigns  that  have  been \nongoing  with  support  from  a  community  engagement  and  gender  specialist,  as  well  as \ncommunity  mobilizers.  The  community  engagement  outreach  has  been  running  concurrently \nwith targeted gender training for MPWU, PUB, urban councils, and community leaders. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nEnvironment.  The  current  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  under \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as impacts are site-specific. Mitigation measures are \nin  place  through  approved  initial  environment  examinations,  in  accordance  with  the  project's \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework.  Corresponding  EMPs  have  been  prepared \nwith  national  requirements  met  and  environmental  licenses  issued  by  MELAD  for  ICB01  and \nICB02.  Since  the  additional  financing  is  for  cost  overruns  only,  with  no  new  or  additional  civil \nwork,  it  is  classified  category  C.  The  environmental  assessment  found  that  the  project  will \nenhance  the  overall  environmental  quality  of  freshwater  and  nearshore  marine  areas  through \nupgraded sewage and sanitation facilities. An international environment specialist and a national \nenvironment inspector are engaged to ensure compliance monitoring of the EMPs and reporting \nto  MELAD.  A  climate  change  adaptation  risk  evaluation  was  conducted  and  considered  in  the \ninfrastructure design. \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement. The current project is classified category B for resettlement. \nAn  updated  resettlement  plan  for  the  project  and  a  land  resettlement  review  framework  are  in \nplace  to  provide  guidance  for  any  unanticipated  impacts.  The  additional  financing  is  classified \ncategory C, as it is designated for civil works to replace three sewerage outfalls on public land. \nThe additional financing will not entail any new or additional civil work that would result in land \nacquisition or resettlement. \n \n28. \nAfter  detailed  design,  there  is  no  known  legal  impediments  regarding  access  to  sites, \nand all surrounding landowners have been advised of the work. Safeguards monitoring reports \nfor the original project are regularly submitted and disclosed. \n \n29. \nIndigenous peoples. The current project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. \nIt  will  have  no  impact  on  any  distinct  and  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nunder the Safeguard Policy Statement. The beneficiaries are the people of South Tarawa, who \nare largely from the i-Kiribati ethnic group. All project outputs will continue to be delivered in a \nculturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.22 Overall,  the  risks  are  being  managed  and  mitigated  under  improved \nproject  implementation  arrangements,  in  particular  the  establishment  of  KFSU  and  the \nengagement  of  a  technical  advisor.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh  the  costs.  The  overall  sustainability  of  the  project  is  being  bolstered  by  institutional \nreforms  at  PUB  and  the  government\u2019s  reinstated  subsidy  for  community  service  obligations  to \nassist O&M funding for water and sewerage infrastructure. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \n31. \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand legal documents. \n \n32. \nset forth in the grant agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $2,800,000 to the Republic of Kiribati for the additional financing of the South Tarawa \nSanitation  Improvement  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources;  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n14 September 2016 \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpact the Project Is Aligned with \n\nCurrent project \nImproved health of South Tarawa\u2019s population \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \n \nClimate change impacts \nare more severe than \npredicted by current \nmodels. \n\nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nCurrent project \nSouth Tarawa\u2019s urban \npopulation has \nenhanced access to \nimproved sanitation \ninfrastructure and \nservices \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \nOutputs \nOutput 1 \nCurrent project \nSanitation and hygiene \npractices among South \nTarawa\u2019s population \nare improved \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\n \n \nCensus data, and \nhousehold and income \nexpenditure survey \n \nWHO and UNICEF joint \nmonitoring data \n\n \n \n \n1a\u2013c.
