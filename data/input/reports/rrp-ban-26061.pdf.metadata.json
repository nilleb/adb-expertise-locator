While  the  ultimate  aim  is  to \nimprove  the  quality  of  learning  in  secondary  schools  through \nimproved  teaching  quality,  the  Project  will  pursue  comprehensive \npolicy, \nfor \nsustainable  development  of  teacher  training.  The  Project  has  four \ncomponents:  (i)  improving  teaching  quality  through  organizational \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  improving  teacher  training \nfacilities, (iii) strengthening in-service and preservice teacher training, \nand  (iv)  increasing  equitable  access  and  improving  community \ninvolvement.  The  project  design  includes  features  that  emphasize \ngender  and  social  development  as  crosscutting  dimensions  in  the \ncomponents, as well as support to teachers in remote areas and from \ndisadvantaged  groups,  including  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project \nincludes  a  policy  and  institutional  reform  framework  with  timebound \nmilestones and linkages to loan assurances.  \n \nSecondary  education  prepares  pupils  for  employment  at  entry  level \nand  serves  as  a  foundation  for  those  who  aspire  for  advanced \nstudies.  Moreover,  secondary  education  of  good  quality  is  of  utmost \nimportance  in  creating  a  basis  for  competitiveness  and  economic \ndevelopment,  which  are  necessary  for  succes sfully  tackling  the \nchallenges  of  globalization.  In  Bangladesh,  steady  growth  in  primary \neducation  has  resulted  in  concomitant  expansion  in  the  number  of \nsecondary  schools,  teachers  and  enrollments.  There  are  18,677 \nsecondary  schools  recognized  by  the  Government.  About  98%  of \nthem  are  private  schools.  There  are  over  8.6  million  students,  of \nwhom  about  53%  are  girls.  The  gross  enrollment  ratio  in  secondary \neducation  averages  about  30%,  marked  by  significant  losses  as \ngrades advance. The total number of teachers is about 240,000. The \ncurrent  proportion  of  female  teachers  is  approximately  17%,  against \nthe Government\u2019s policy of having at least 30% female teachers. \n\nrequired \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding   the   quantitative  achievements, in  the secondary \neducation system weaknesses are reflected in the declining quality of \ngraduates  and  teachers.  About  60%  of  teachers  are  still  untrained, \nwhile most schools are devoid of standard conditions essential for the \nnormal instructional process. The extent of wastage in the system is \nreflected in terms of both failure and dropout rates. \n \nDropout rates average 44% for secondary grades 6\u201310 and 38% for \nhigher secondary grades 11\u201312. Pass rates for the secondary school \ncertificate (SSC) have been declining in the last 5 years from 55% in \n1999  to  36%  in  2003.  Pass  rates  of  higher  secondary  certificate \n(HSC) have been declining from 56% in 1999 to 27% in 2002, with a \nslightly  improved  38%  in  2003.  The  failure  rates  represent  a  huge \nwastage  of  financial  resources.  Specific  investment  particularly  for \nimproving  teaching  quality  in  secondary  education  is  necessary  and \njustified to support the Government in achieving the Education-for-All-\nGoals and Millennium Development Goals. \n \nThe  decline  in  the  quality  of  secondary  education  can  largely  be \nattributed  to  poor  teaching.  Poor  and  disadvantaged  students  are \nmost  affected  since  they  rarely  have  other  educational  options  and \ncannot  afford  the  fees  charged  for  additional  tuition.  While  there  is \nsignificant  improvement  in  girls'  enrollment  in  secondary  education, \ntheir  performance  and  retention  are  undermined  by  several  factors, \nincluding  lack  of  female  teachers  in  the  schools.  The  standard  of \neducation  being  provided  is  inadequate  and  there  is  a  need  to \napproach the problem in a multifaceted manner. The Project seeks to \nimprove  teacher  training,  its  planning,  management,  and  quality  of \ndelivery  through  organizational  development  and  capacity  building, \nhuman \nthe  existing, \nunderutilized network of teacher training colleges and institutions. The \nProject  will  support  training  of  female  teachers  and  teachers  in \nremote  areas  and  from  disadvantaged  groups,  including  ethnic \nminorities. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  enhance  the  quality  of  secondary  education  in \nBangladesh secondary schools by improving the quality of teaching.  \nThe  purpose  is  to  provide  quality  initial  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining, including continuing professional development, to all eligible \nteachers  of  grades  6\u201310  in  government  and  private  secondary \nschools. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $108.7 million equivalent. \nOf  this  amount,  $37.2  million  equivalent,  or  34%  of  the  total  cost,   \nis the foreign exchange cost, and $71.5 million equivalent, or  66% of \nthe total, is the local currency cost. \n \n\nresources  development,  and \n\nrevitalizing \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n\nv \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provides  a \nloan of $68.9 million from its Special Funds resources to finance 63% \nof  the  project  costs.  The  amount  covers  $29.9  million  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $39.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  is  planning \nto provide joint grant co-financing of $18.0 million, which is 17% of the \ntotal cost. The grant will be administered by ADB and subject to ADB \nguidelines  and  procedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services \nand consultant selection.  \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nCanadian International \nDevelopm ent Agency a \nGovernment of Bangladesh \nTotal \n\n \n29.9 \n \n7.3 \n0 \n37.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n39.1 \n \n10.7 \n21.7 \n71.5 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n68.9 \n \n18.0 \n21.7 \n108.7 \n\n ($ million) \n\nPercent \n\n \n63 \n\n \n\n       17 \n20 \n100 \n\na Joint grant co-financing is subject to final confirmation from Canadian International     \n  Development Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $68.9  million  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  47,000,000 \nfrom its Special Funds resources to finance 63% of the project costs. \nThe  term  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 September 2011 \n \n \n31 March 2011 \n \nThe  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (DSHE),  under \nthe overall guidance of the Ministry of Education (MOE).  \n \nMOE  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  oversee \nproject implementation. A project implementation committee (PIC) will \nbe  established  with  representatives  from  all  stakeholder  institutions \ninvolved  in  implementing  the  Project.  As  and  when  necessary, \ntechnical committees may also be formed. A project management unit \n(PMU)  to  be  established  at  DSHE  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-\nday  operational  management  of  project  implementation,  monitoring \nand  evaluation  of  progress,  and  liaison  with  ADB.  To  ensure  close \ntraining  programs, \ncoordination  of \noperational  branches  of  the  PMU  will  be  established  at  the  major \nstakeholder institutions of the Project. \n \n\nthe  project  activities  and \n\n\fvi \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nLocal procurement through local competitive bidding (LCB) will follow \nthe  Government\u2019s  new  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003,  and \nacceptable to ADB. Vehicles and equipment will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) for packages above $500,000 \nand  international  shopping  (IS)  for  packages  below  $500,000,  \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \nAll international and associated domestic consultants will be financed \nfrom the ADB loan and CIDA cofinanced grant funds administered by \nADB,  and  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  \n \nThe  Project  focuses  on  systemic  improvement  in  delivery  of  teacher \ntraining, and its planning, management, and monitoring in secondary \neducation,  and  thus  improvement  in  teaching  quality.  The  long-term \nbenefits  of  the  investment  will  be  improved  organizational  and \ninstitutional  development,  and  human \nresource  development \nstrategies  in  the  teacher  training  system;  and  provision  of  additional \nfinancial  and  other  resources  that  will  ensure  greater  long-term \nsustainability of teacher training, both technically and financially.  \n \nImproved  initial  and  in-service  training  programs  for  teachers  and \nhead teachers together with improved training materials and facilities \nwill  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  better  quality \nsecondary  education.  The  training  programs  will  ensure  greater  use \nof classroom practices that are appropriate for teaching and learning \nin secondary education.  The efficiency and benefits of the investment \nare further achieved by prioritizing for  training  under  the  Project  for \nteachers  under  the  age  of  40.  Access  of  female  candidates,  and \ncandidates from remote areas and disadvantaged groups to teacher \ntraining  will  be  supported.  Appropriate  gender  dimensions,  gender \ntraining,  and  social  development  dimensions  will  be \nequality \nincorporated and mainstreamed in the teacher training programs and \nmaterials.  The  role  of  women  as  members  of  school  management \ncommittees (SMCs) as well as the role of SMCs in improving teaching \nquality at grassroots level will be supported.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction indirectly. The indirect \nbeneficiaries are pupils in secondary schools who will benefit from the \nimproved teaching skills of teachers. Improvement in teaching quality \nwill further improve learning by pupils, who will show better education \noutcomes  and  better  performance  in  the  labor  market.  Overall,  the \nestimated immediate beneficiaries of the Project are (i) about 100,000 \nserving  untrained  teachers  who  will  be  trained  as  teachers,  (ii)  all \n50,000 new teachers who will benefit from training at teacher training \ncolleges  and  institutions  that  use  new  training  methods  and  delivery \nmodes,  (iii)  all  17,000  head  teachers  who  will  benefit  from  the \nupgraded  head  teacher  training,  (iv)  all\u2014over  200,000\u2014serving \nteachers  who  will  benefit  from  professional  development    programs \nintroduced  by  the  Project,  and  (v)  all\u2014over 700\u2014 teacher trainers  \n\n\fvii \n\nwho  will  benefit  from  professional  development  designed  for  them, \nand  from  upgraded  facilities  and  equipment.  Ultimate  beneficiaries \nwill be the pupils in grades 6\u201310, estimated at 9.5 million by the end \nof the Project.  \n \nThe  design  of  the  Project  draws  heavily  from  lessons  from  previous \ninterventions,  and  is  supported  through  a  comprehensive policy and \ninstitutional reform framework. While the Government is committed to \nthese reforms, there is a risk that a future Government could reverse \nthis  commitment.  The  factor  mitigating  this  risk  is  the  fact  that  the \nreforms  are  very  much  linked  with  wider  long-term  development \nframeworks of Bangladesh in the education sector, and beyond, with \nlinkages  to  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  the  medium-\nterm macroeconomic framework. \n \nAs  a  result  of  administrative  changes,  operating  costs  of upgraded \nand rehabilitated training institutions, and a series of education grants \nintroduced by the proposed  Project, there are direct cost implications \nfor  teacher  training  in  the  recurrent  budget  after  the  project \ninvestment period. These  costs  can  be sufficiently financed  through \nthe proposed increase in the teacher training budget. There  are also \nindirect  cost  implications.  Changes  in  the  teacher  qualification  policy \nduring  the  project  period  lead  to  salary  increase  from  untrained  to \ntrained teacher  pay  scale levels.  These  increases can  be absorbed \nby increments in the secondary education budget between 2005 and \n2011 under the base case scenario, based on ADB and International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) analysis of the economy.  \n \n\n By  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  approved  a  policy \nrequiring  all  new  secondary  teachers  to  be  trained  to  a  minimum  \n1  year  Bachelor  of  Education  (BEd)  level  and  no  untrained  teachers \nwill  be  appointed  to  teacher  posts  in  secondary  schools  after  2007. \nThe policy will increase demand and motivation of untrained teachers \nfor  training.  However,  other  factors  may  reduce  the  motivation.  \nParticularly  opportunity  costs  of  female  teachers  and  teachers  from \nremote  areas  or  other  disadvantaged  groups  may  be  too  high.  \nThis risk is mitigated by providing training grants for participants from \nthese  groups.  Additional  support  will  be  provided  for  female  teacher \ntrainees.  \n\nEstablishing  and  building  the  capacity  of  the  Nongovernment \nTeachers  Registration  and  Certification  Agency  (NTRCA),  and \ndeveloping  appropriate  transparent  procedures  in  this  area  are \nexpected to significantly mitigate the risk of abuse and rent-seeking in \nhiring practices in private secondary schools. Recruitment of trained, \nqualified,  and  registered  head  teachers  and  teachers  by  private \nsecondary schools will be linked with the subvention provided by the \nGovernment  for  these  schools. This will  further  significantly  mitigate \nthe risk of abuse and rent-seeking. \n\n  \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Teaching  Quality  Improvement  in  Secondary \nEducation Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nA. \n\n Performance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nSecondary  education  prepares  pupils  for  employment  at  entry  level  and  serves  as  a \nfoundation for those who  aspire for advanced studies. In Bangladesh, steady growth in primary \neducation over the last three decades has resulted in a concomitant expansion in the number of \nschools,  teachers,  and  enrollments.  Currently  Bangladesh  has  18,677  secondary  schools \nrecognized  by  the  Government.  The  schools  have  over  8.6  million  students,  of  whom  about \n53% are girls. The gross enrollment ratio in secondary education averages about 30%, marked \nby significant losses as grades advance: i.e., 38% in junior secondary, 25% in secondary, and \n19% in higher secondary education. The total number of teachers in the secondary schools is \nabout  240,000,  of  whom  about  150,000  are  untrained.  The  proportion  of  female  teachers  is \napproximately  17%  and  has  been  slowly  increasing  since  the  early  1990s.  The  current \ngovernment policy is that women teachers should eventually make up 30% of all teachers. \n\n3. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  is  responsible  for  policy  and  planning  for  secondary, \nvocational,  technical,  and  higher  education  in  Bangladesh.  The Directorate of Secondary and \nHigher  Education  (DSHE)  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  administration  of  the  18,677 \nsecondary  schools,  2,293  colleges,  and  7,279  postprimary  madrasahs  (religious  schools).  \nFor administrative purposes DSHE has divided the country into nine zones. Districts are headed \nby  district  education  officers.  Given  the  enormous  growth  in  the  number  of  secondary \ninstitutions  in  recent  years,  the  Government\u2019s  administrative  and  supervisory  capacity  is \ninadequate to fulfill its responsibilities.  For quality assurance, DSHE has no effective inspection \nand  supervision  system  and  no  inspection  staff  at  Upazila  (subdistrict)  level.  Inspection  and \nsupervision of teacher training institutions are unsatisfactory and irregular at best.  \n\n4. \nAbout 98% of secondary schools are private. Each private secondary school is overseen \nby its own school management committee (SMC). However, despite the massive government \nfinancial  subvention  program  that  provides  90%  of  teacher  salaries  in  the  private  secondary \nschools,  performance  or  accountability  requirements  are  few.  Indiscriminate  establishment  of \nschools and colleges that fail to meet minimum standards contribute to the deterioration of the \nquality  of  education.  ADB\u2019s  current  loan  project2  has  assisted  the  Government  in  developing \nreform measures to improve the quality, efficiency, and accountability of SMCs.3   \n\n5. \nNotwithstanding  the  quantitative  achievements,  weaknesses  in  the  secondary  system \nare  reflected  in  the  declining  quality  of  graduates  and  teachers.  Challenges  have  remained. \nAbout 60% of teachers are still untrained, while most schools are devoid of standard conditions \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Standard  cohort  analysis  over  the  entire \nsecondary  cycle  reveals  the  extent  of  wastage  in  the  secondary  education  system  in  terms  of \nboth failure and dropout rates.  Dropout rates average 44% for secondary grades 6\u201310 (49% for \ngirls), and 38% for higher secondary grades 11\u201312 (36% for girls). Pass rates for the secondary \nschool  certificate  (SSC)  have  been  declining  in  the  last  5  years  from  55%  in  1999  to  36%  in \n2003. Pass rates for the higher secondary certificate (HSC) declined from 56% in 1999 to 27% \nin 2002, but slightly improved to 38% in 2003. These failure rates represent a huge wastage of \nfinancial resources.  \n \nThe decline in quality of secondary education can mainly be attributed to poor teaching. \n6. \nPoor  and  disadvantaged  students  are  most  affected  since  they  rarely  have  other  educational \noptions  and  cannot  afford  the  fees  charged  for  additional  tuition.  While  girls'  enrollment  has \nsignificantly improved, their performance and retention in secondary education are undermined \nby several factors, including lack of female teachers in the schools. The implications are that the \nsecondary  education  being  provided  is  inadequate  and  that  there  is  a  need  to  approach  the \nproblem in a multifaceted manner. The Project seeks to improve teacher training in secondary \neducation, \nthrough  organizational \ndevelopment,  capacity  building,  human  resources  development,  and  revitalizing  the  existing, \nunderutilized  network  of  teacher  training  colleges  and  institutions.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nsupport  the  training  of  female  teachers  and  teachers  from  remote  areas  and  disadvantaged \ngroups, including ethnic minorities. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nits  planning,  management,  and  quality  of  delivery \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nWhile  Bangladesh  has  made  significant  progress  in  providing  access  to  secondary \n7. \neducation to increasing numbers of students,  including girls, the quality of teaching, and hence \nstudent learning, continue to be a major concern. As a result,  dropout rates are high. Students \nwho  manage  to  complete  secondary  education  are  unprepared  to  enter  the  workforce  or  to \ncontinue  with  their  education.  Assistance  focusing  particularly  on  improving  the  teacher \neducation system and the quality of teaching is necessary. Subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \nA  summary  is  provided  in  paras.  8\u201310.  Problem  and  constraints  analysis,  and  government \nactions to overcome them, are in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n\n1. \n\nQuality \n\n8. \nThe  main  constraint  to  provision  of  quality  secondary  education  in  Bangladesh  is  the \nacute shortage of trained secondary school teachers; fewer than half of the teachers have had \nany  teacher  training,  and  the  rest  are  poorly  trained.  The  teacher  recruitment  system  is \ninadequate,  lacks  transparency  and  has  many  unfair  practices.  Teaching  as  a  career  is  not \nvalued and there are no incentives for rewarding teaching effort and excellence. Consequently, \nteacher  inertia  and  absenteeism  are  widespread.  The  problem  is  exacerbated  by  lack  of \nteaching  standards  on  which  to  build  a  quality  teacher  training  system.  The  curriculum and \ntextbooks are outdated, and the prevailing learning culture and examination system emphasize \nlearning  by  rote  rather  than  creative  thinking  and  practical  work  skills.  This situation, together \nwith  a  shortage  of  teaching  and  learning  resources,  results  in  poor  teaching  quality  and \nclassroom  performance.  Students  who  leave  the  system  are  generally  unprepared  to  face \ncompetition in a modern economy and in the global community. \n \n\n2. \n\nSystemic Problems \n\n9. \nThe  absence  of  strategic  planning  and  coordination  for  teacher  training  in  secondary \neducation  in  Bangladesh,  largely  owing  to  the  absence  of  a  functioning  authority  to  discharge \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nthis important responsibility, has contributed to the unsatisfactory situation. The uncoordinated \noperations of multiple  teacher  training  institutions,  with  a  variety  of  teacher  training  programs \nand undefined training standards and competencies for teachers, make it difficult to identify and \nmeasure the quality of teachers during their initial training. The secondary education system has \nweak  organizational  and  supervisory  competence  and  lacks  the  capacity  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  performance  at  all  important  levels,  i.e.,  administrative,  teaching,  and  student  levels. \nDifficulties in evaluating and upgrading teacher performance in schools as a basis for in-service \nand  further  training  arise  from  a  lack  of  competencies  on  which  to  base  assessment  and \ninspection  results.  Efforts  to  improve  teaching  quality  are  also  hindered  by  the  insufficient \nfunding and budgets of the secondary education system. Unfilled vacancies at all levels of the \nsecondary education system are a major problem. \n \n\n3. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\n10. \nA  major  issue  particularly  affecting  rural  areas  and  children  in  other  disadvantaged \npopulations  is  inequitable  access  and  opportunity.  Development  partners  have been  working \nwith the Government on a number of projects to alleviate the problems of access, particularly for \ngirls,  through  stipend  programs.  More  equitable  access  to  teacher  training  should  also  be \nsupported  for  female  students  and  students  from  rural  areas  and  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding  ethnic  minorities.  Gender  and  social  development  policies  need  strengthening  to \ntackle  the  inequitable  gender balance in hiring  and assigning  female  teachers.  Little  attention \nhas  been  paid  to  strengthening  gender  and  social  development  dimensions  and  embedding \nthem in teacher training programs and materials. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons Learned  \n\n11. \nOne  of  the  main  objectives  of  the  operational  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  in  education  in  Bangladesh  is  to  improve  educational  quality  and  system  efficiency, \nparticularly in teacher training.  In the past, ADB assisted the Government to lay the foundations \nfor  teacher  education  in  secondary  education  through  several  projects,  including  establishing \nhigher  secondary  teacher  training  institutes  (HSTTIs),4  constructing  secondary  education \nscience  development  centers  (SESDCs),5  and  providing  facilities  and  equipment.6  ADB\u2019s \nsupport  to  Bangladesh  Open  University  (BOU)  has  on  its  part  also  improved  teachers' \nopportunities  to  further  their  studies  in  education.7  Over  the  years,  the  focus  of  ADB  loan \nprojects has shifted toward sector policy development and reforms, and systemic improvement \nto  support  the  Government\u2019s  broader  education  reform  agenda.  Accordingly,  the  ongoing \nSecondary  Education  Sector  Improvement  Project  (SESIP)  (footnote  2)  aims  to  improve \nsecondary education through sector reforms, including the development of policies for teacher \neducation,  standards,  and  curriculum.  In  addition,  specific  investment  for  improving  teaching \nquality  in  secondary  education  is  necessary  and  justified  to  support  the  Government  in \nachieving  the  Education-for-All  Goals  and  Millennium Development Goals.  The  design  of  the \nproposed  Project  builds  strongly  on  lessons  from  previous  ADB-funded  projects  and  other \nexternally  funded  projects.  The  Project  seeks  to  improve  teacher  training,  its  planning, \nmanagement, and quality of delivery through  policy and  organizational development, capacity \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1991.

To assist efficiently in \nproviding  access  to  female  teachers,  and  improve  their  employment,  useful  and  successful \ndesign  features  have  been  adopted  particularly  from  the  Program  to  Motivate,  Train,  and \nEmploy Female Teachers  in  Rural  Secondary  Schools  (PROMOTE),  funded  by  the  European \nCommission.  A  summary  of  external  assistance  and  lessons  learned  is  in  Appendix  3.  \nThe policy and institutional reform matrix for the proposed Project is in Appendix 4.   \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe goal of the Project is to  enhance the quality of secondary education in Bangladesh \n12. \nsecondary schools by improving the quality of teaching.  The purpose is to provide quality initial \nand  in-service  teacher  training,  including  continuing  professional  development,  to  all  eligible \nteachers of grades 6\u201310 in Government and private secondary schools. \n  \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n13. \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improving  teaching  quality  through organizational \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  improving  teacher  training  facilities,  (iii)  strengthening   \nin-service  and  preservice  teacher  training,  and  (iv)  increasing  equitable  access  and  improving \ncommunity  involvement.  Implementation  will  encompass  development  activities  at  central \nGovernment level, at all teacher training colleges and institutes, and on pilot basis at community \nlevel.  \n \n\n1. \n\nImproving  Teaching  Quality  Through  Organizational  Development  and \nCapacity Building \n\n14. \nEstablishing  an  Integrated  Secondary  Teacher  Training  System.  A  number  of \norganizations,  including  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs),  Madrasah  Teacher  Training  Institute \n(MTTI),  HSTTIs,  SESDC,  as  well  as  National  Academy  of  Educational  Management  (NAEM), \nNational  University  (NU),  and  BOU,  are  currently  involved  in  providing  different  aspects  of \nteacher  training  in  secondary  education.  However,  there  is  a  clear  lack  of  coordination  and \ninstitutional  linkage  between  them.  To  overcome  this,  the  education  reform  recommendations \ninclude transformation and restructuring NAEM to become the institutional home of excellence \nfor  secondary  education  teacher  training.  NAEM  will  be  responsible  for  managing  and \ncoordinating  secondary  education  teacher  training  nationwide.  In  addition,  a  Nongovernment \nTeachers  Registration  and  Certification  Agency  (NTRCA)  will  be  established.  NTRCA  will  be   \nresponsible  for  certifying,  registering,  and  deploying  all  qualified  teachers  and  head  teachers \nworking in secondary education, and accrediting teacher training programs. Under the NAEM, a \nnational integrated secondary teacher training system will be established to link all levels of the \ntraining  network  from  the  central  administration  to  the  schools,  to  coordinate  and  manage \nteacher qualification and training. It will be important to link the process also with monitoring and \nevaluation  data  and  analysis  provided  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Educational  Information \nand Statistics (BANBEIS) and with functions of DSHE. The Project will assist with reorganizing \nthe structure and functions of the various institutions involved in this proposed training network. \n \n15. \nBuilding the Capacity of National Academy of Educational Management. NAEM will \nbe transformed and restructured to become the institutional home of excellence for secondary \neducation teacher training. NAEM\u2019s role will be broadened to include all aspects of delivery of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nthan \n\nteacher \n\ntraining,  rather \n\nteacher  and  head \n\nsecondary  education \njust  education \nmanagement. The role of NAEM will be to set and maintain standards for teacher education and \ntraining nationwide. The Project will assist the Government with building the capacity of NAEM \nand implementing its transformation.  \n \nBuilding  the  Capacity of Nongovernment Teachers Registration and Certification \n16. \nAgency.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  NTRCA  for  secondary  education.  After \nundertaking an accredited training program and examination, and obtaining an approved initial \nteacher  training  qualification,  a  teacher  may  be  registered  as  qualified  after  carrying  out  a \nsuccessful first year of probationary teaching. The performance would be certified by the head \nteacher, and confirmed by other local level education officials. A policy will be approved prior to \nloan  effectiveness  and  implemented  during  the  Project  that  only  trained  and  registered \nsecondary schools teachers will be allowed to teach in secondary schools. All head teachers will \nbe  registered  on  successful  completion  of  their  initial  head  teacher  training  course  and  only \nregistered  head  teachers,  with  teaching  experience,  will  be  appointed  as  head  teachers  in \nsecondary schools.  \n \nStrengthening  the  Capacity of  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education. \n17. \nPart of the Project focus will be on building and strengthening the capacity of DSHE to carry out \nits mandated functions. In coordination with the NTRCA, the Division of Training of DSHE will be \nresponsible for overseeing secondary school teacher education, both pre-service and in-service. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  Division  with  specific  support  and  capacity  building  to  undertake \nthese functions efficiently, as well as support to the Policy and Strategy Planning Unit (PSPU) at \nDSHE, which was established under SESIP initiative.  \n \n18. \nStrengthening the Capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and \nStatistics (BANBEIS). The capacity of BANBEIS will be strengthened to ensure improved data \ncollection for teacher training, certification, and registration, and for continuous monitoring and \nevaluation of teacher training, including the development of a geographic information system to \nmap all postprimary institutions. The Project will support BANBEIS to carry out its expanded role \nthrough  improved  equipment  and  capacity  building,  including  the  capacity  to  provide  data  for \nresearch  studies  focusing  on  teaching  quality  and  other  factors  affecting  the  performance  of \nsecondary  schools.  The  capacity  of  BANBEIS  to  assist  MOE  and  other  stakeholders  in \ninterpreting data for policy formulation will be strengthened. \n \n19. \nTraining  Head  Teachers  and  Administrators.  The  Project  will  build  the  capacity  for \nand  enhance  the  continuing  training  and  support,  provided  through  NAEM,  for  head  teachers \nand administrators. They will play a key role in improving and maintaining of teaching quality, to \nbe  reflected  in  upgrading  the  existing  courses  to  include  aspects  of  innovative  teaching  and \ngood  education  practices,  and  specifically  the  role  of  head  teachers  and  administrators  in \nencouraging  and  maintaining  good  teaching  practice  through  monitoring  and  professional \nsupport. This role will help institutionalize quality control and assurance. \n \n20. \nA  policy  to  be  introduced  will  ensure  all  new  head  teachers  undergo compulsory initial \ntraining through NAEM, on appointment. On completion of the training they will be registered as \nqualified head teachers. All serving untrained head teachers will undergo the compulsory initial \ntraining at NAEM during the project  period and, on completion of the training, will be registered \nas  qualified  head  teachers.  All  serving  head  teachers,  trained  and  untrained,  will  annually \nundergo  compulsory  in-service  professional  development  training,  developed  through  NAEM, \nand carried out through the proposed network of training institutes.  \n\n\f 6\n\n2. \n\nImproving Teacher Training Facilities \n\n21. \nSecondary  Teacher  Training  Colleges.  Support  for  upgrading  the  physical  facilities \nand equipment of NAEM, and  government  secondary  TTCs,  including  MTTI,  will  be  provided. \nSupport will include  renovation  of  classrooms,  libraries,  laboratories,  storage,  and  provision  of \nfurniture and teaching aids, where necessary. Each government TTC, and MTTI will be provided \nwith an audiovisual laboratory and computer laboratory with Internet connection and adequate \nworkstations  to  meet  the  needs  of  staff  and  students.  Facilities  of  existing  teaching  resource \ncenters,  established  in  the  TTCs  with  funding  from  PROMOTE,  will  be  further  utilized  and \ndeveloped, as necessary, for the professional teacher development.   \n \n22. \nIn-Service  Teacher  Training  Network.  The  delivery  of  in-service  teacher  training \nthrough the development of a network of training institutes will be strengthened, based on the \nexisting  eleven  TTCs,  and  three  additional  TTCs  being  established  by  the  government,  MTTI, \nnine  SESDCs  and  five  HSTTIs,  together  with  selected  and  approved  private  TTCs.  \nThe SESDCs and the HSTTIs have remained dormant and underutilized for a number of years. \nThey will be rejuvenated and upgraded as key institutions for the proposed in-service education \nand  training  network,  for  institutionalizing  in-service  training  and  continuous  professional \ndevelopment of teachers. In addition, new resource centers will be constructed and equipped at \nthe three new TTCs, which currently are being built by the Government, as part of the in-service \neducation  and  training  network  to  ensure  full  coverage,  particularly  in  the  remote  and \nunderserved  areas.  The  network  of  training  institutions  with  upgraded  facilities  will  play  a  key \nrole  in  delivering  training,  both  to  train  untrained  teachers  and  to  continue  the  professional \ndevelopment of teachers and head teachers.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening In-Service and Preservice Teacher Training \n\n23. \nTeacher Training  Accreditation.  Accreditation  is  a  crucial  element  for  controlling  the \nquality of the system of teacher training. Building on the current work of SESIP, the Project will \nenhance the quality of teacher education by improving the accreditation criteria and processes, \nenforcing  standards,  and  improving  the  design  of  the  teacher  training  syllabus  to  ensure  a \nnationally  standardized  and  accredited  Bachelor  of  Education  (BEd)  in  modular  form,  as  the \nbasic  requisite  qualification  for  teaching  in  a  secondary  school.  The  current  accreditation \nprocedures  and  monitoring  will  be  reviewed  and  will  be  improved,  including  those  for  private \nTTCs.  \n \nA  modular  1-year  BEd  syllabus,  currently  being  developed  with  support  from  SESIP,   \n24. \nwill  be  further  developed  and  introduced  by  the  Project  as  the  basic  initial  qualification  for \nuntrained  teachers.  The  modular  BEd  will  be  accredited  by  the  NTRCA,  and  candidates \nsuccessfully  passing  an  examination  will  be  granted  the  BEd.  Delivery  of  courses  for  each \nmodule  can  be  carried  out  by  any  government  or  private  institution,  or  by  distance  mode,  but \nwith  national  public  examinations  supervised  and  accredited  by  the  NTRCA,  thus allowing the \nintroduction  of  one  national  standard  for  the  BEd,  irrespective  of  the  mode  or  standard of the \ndelivering institution. \n \n25. \nPreservice  Teacher  Training  for  New  Teachers.  Under  a  policy  to  be  introduced,  \nall  new  teachers  must  be  trained  to  a  minimum  1  year  BEd  level  in  Government  TTCs,  MTTI, \nand  also  in  approved  private  TTCs.  MTTI  will  receive  assistance  to  develop  a  specialized \nmodule  covering  religious  studies  for  the  standardized  BEd  course.  The  annual  total  target  is \nestimated  to  average  8,300  teacher  trainees.  The  capacity  for  training  new  teachers  will  be \nsufficient  when  the  three  new  TTCs,  which  are  currently  being  built  by  the  Government,  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nhave  been  established.  In  addition,  it  is  expected  that  an  additional  number  of  newly  qualified \nBEd teachers graduating from private TTCs will meet the proposed standards of the NTRCA. \n \n26. \nIn-Service Initial Teacher Training\u2014Teacher Training Certificate .  A major initiative \nwill  be  to  develop  and  implement  a  new  in-service  teacher  training  program  to  train  untrained \nteachers currently serving in schools.  Training will be carried out in a phased manner in a two-\nstage  system.  A  basic  in-service  training  course  at  certificate  level  will  be  designed  and \nprovided for all untrained teachers as a component of the proposed modular 1-year BEd course.  \nThe  certificate  course  will  concentrate  on the practical aspects of classroom teaching and will \nprovide exemption from the specified parts of the BEd contained in the module. The activities at \nthe colleges and training institutions will be supported through provision of training coordinators \nat  the  resource  centers  of  the  institutions.  The  coordinators  may  be  engaged  from  the  critical \nmass of teacher educators that have been trained with funding from SESIP and resource center \ncoordinators  who  have  been  trained  under  PROMOTE.  The  coordinators  will  work under the \noverall coordination of NAEM. The teacher training certificate module will be delivered through \nthe proposed network of training institutes. A  percentage (35%) of the existing BEd increment \n(i.e.,  enhancement  of  salary  subvention)  will  be  awarded  on  completion  of  the  training  and \nsuccessful teachers will be registered as \u201cqualified.\u201d \n \n27. \nCurrently there are an estimated 150,000 untrained teachers in secondary schools and \nthe  limited  time  and  resources  available  make  it  impossible  to  train  all  of  them  within  a \nreasonable time scale. Therefore, all serving untrained teachers under the age of 40 years will \nundergo  compulsory  certificate  training,  giving  an  estimated  overall  target  of  about  100,000 \nserving  certificate  trained  teachers,  including  madrasah  teachers,  during  the  project  period. \nDuring  this  period,  or  soon  after,  many  of  the  older  untrained  teachers  will  retire,  and  with \ncompulsory  training  on  entry  it  is  anticipated  that  the  entire  secondary  teacher  workforce  will \ngradually  move  toward  qualification  to  a  minimum  level  over  a  period  approximately  10  years, \nand eventually to an entirely BEd standard secondary teacher workforce. \n \n28. \nThe certificate trained teachers will be encouraged to voluntarily enroll and complete the \nremaining modules of the 1 year BEd training, either by distance mode through BOU, or in face-\nto-face  mode  through  the  government  TTCs,  MMTI,  or  accredited  private  TTCs.  The  full  BEd \nincrement will be awarded to all trained teachers on completion of the accredited BEd.  \n \n29. \nAll  serving  untrained  teachers  over  the  age  of  40  years  will  be  encouraged  to  enroll \nvoluntarily  for  the  3-month  in-service  training  certificate,  either  through  the  training  institute \ncourses, if space is available, or through  distance  mode.  In  the  same  way  as  for  the  younger \nteachers, a percentage (35%) of the existing BEd increment will be awarded on completion of \nthe training and successful teachers will be registered as qualified. Those qualifying through this \nmethod will be encouraged to complete the  BEd voluntarily through distance mode, and the full \nBEd increment will be awarded on completion. \n \n30. \nTeacher In-Service Professional Development. All serving teachers, both trained and \nuntrained,  will  undergo  compulsory  in-service  professional  development  training  at  least  once \nduring  the  project  period,  carried  out  through  the  upgraded  network  of  training  institutes  and \nselected  private  TTCs.  A  system  of  selective  need-based  specialist  in-service  training  will  be \ndeveloped  to  upgrade  teachers  in  areas  of  identified  weakness  and  will  be  provided  through \nspecialist  courses.  Distance  education  delivery  mode  will  be  developed,  as  appropriate,  \nfor selected aspects of in-service continuing professional development. \n \n31. \nTraining  for  Teacher  Trainers.  Increasing  the  number  of  teacher  trainers  and \nimproving their quality, in both subject matter and pedagogy, will improve the quality of teaching \n\n\f 8\n\nand learning. With the assistance of the Project, the quality of the teacher trainers working in the \nTTCs  and  in  other  teacher  training  network  institutions  will  be  upgraded  and  enhanced. \nCapacity  building  will  be  provided  through  a  combination  of  international  and  local  training, \nleading  to  Master  of  Education  (MEd),  postgraduate  diploma,  and  other  relevant  postgraduate \nstudies  for  potential  teacher  trainers  in  education  service,  coordinated  through  NAEM  with  the \nassistance  of  the  Project.  The  newly  developed  program  of  initial  teacher  education,  prepared \nwith  assistance  from  SESIP,  will  be  the  basis  for  this  training.  Staff  development  inputs  under \nSESIP's teacher education component will create a key initial critical mass of teacher trainers, \nthat  will  be  a  valuable  resource  for  the  Project  when  expanding  staff  development  activities in \nthe colleges and training institutions. \n \n32. \nTeacher  Training  Materials.  The  training  required  for  a  quality  teaching  force  will \nnecessitate  improved  teaching  and  training  materials  for  certificate  and  BEd  training\u2013  \ne.g.,  trainers\u2019  guides,  textbooks,  and  manuals  for  the  revised  in-service  and  preservice \nsyllabus\u2013and support for teachers in schools. The materials will be prepared in formats suitable \nfor  use  through  both  the  standard  face-to-face  training  and  distance  education  modes  of \ndelivery.  BOU  has  the  facilities  for  producing  and  distributing  the  required  teacher  training \nmaterials  and  will  be  commissioned  to  carry  out  this  work,  supported  with  enhanced  facilities, \nmaterials, and assistance from the Project. Ownership and copyright of training materials will lie \nwith  NAEM.  All  materials  produced  under  the  Project  will  be  audited  to  ensure  gender \nsensitivity.   \n \n33. \nInnovation  and  Development  Fund.  An  innovation  and  development  fund  will  be \nestablished  and  made  available  to  teacher  education  institutions  to  support  and  implement \nreforms and innovative schemes for improving quality of teaching, particularly those initiated at \nthe  local  level  through  schools,  TTCs,  MMTI,  SESDCs,  HSTTIs,  and  resource  centers  in \npartnership with other organizations. Innovative schemes may include, where possible, learning \nfrom and working with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which have experience in teacher \ntraining  in  secondary  education.  The  fund's  operation  manual  will  be  finalized  at  project \ninception, detailing the application procedures, selection criteria, regulations and guidelines for \nfunding,  and  reporting  and  monitoring  requirements.  An  innovation  and  development  fund \ncommittee,  whose  composition  will  be  subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  ADB  and  CIDA,  will \nassess the proposals according to a set criteria agreed upon by the Project, ADB and CIDA.     \nA description of the fund, including draft criteria, is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n4. \n\nIncreasing Equitable Access and Improving Community Involvement \n\n34. \nIncreased  Access.  The  importance  of  improving  teaching  quality  in  the  remote  and \nunderserved areas will be emphasized by giving priority for both initial and in-service training to \nteachers from those areas, including ethnic minorities, in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples. The supply of good quality teachers will be ensured by a policy providing for additional, \nor enhanced, training grants for teachers from  those areas. The training grants are described in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n35.  With  assistance  from  the  Project,  three  outreach  stations  or  mobile  satellite  teacher \nresource  centers  will  be  established  to  improve  access  to  teacher  education  in  areas  of \nRangamati  in  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  (CHT),  Patuakhali,  and  Thakurgaon,  with  appropriate \nprofessional linkages with the nearest training institutes. These underserved and remote areas \ndo not have a teacher training institute. A network of outlying or mobile facilities will be piloted \nand  developed,  based  on  the  resource  centers.  The  pilots  will  include  school  cluster-based \ndistance  education  for  teachers  and  professional  development  in  remote  and  underserved \nareas. In addition, teacher resource centers will be established at the three new TTCs currently \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nbeing constructed by the Government in Sylhet, Faridpur, and Pubna. To encourage teachers to \nwork in the underserved areas, a teacher deployment policy will be developed. The Government \nwill extend the current incentive package\u2014provided to government employees in CHT, remote \nand  underserved  areas\u2014to secondary school teachers who serve in those areas or represent \nethnic minorities.  \n \n36. \nImproved Teaching and Learning for Disadvantaged Children. With support from the \nProject,  special  teaching  and  learning  materials  will  be  prepared  for  teachers  working  with \nchildren  from  various  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  the  disabled,  ethnic  minorities,  and \nrefugees.  Assistance  will  be  provided  in  preparing  and  training  for  the  delivery  of  these \nmaterials,  which  will  be  prepared  at  selected  institutions  that  have  expertise  in  these  areas. \nGroups of teachers and teacher trainers will be sent for overseas study in these specialist areas \nand  topics.  In  the  initial  and  in-service  training  for  all  head  teachers and for district and other \ngovernment officials, a training component will be developed on ways of enhancing the teaching \nand learning of children from disadvantaged groups.  \n \n37. \nFemale  Teachers  and  Teacher  Educators.  Government  policy  allocates  30%  of \nteacher postings to female teachers. The  Project will build on successful interventions made by \nvarious  development  partners  to  further  develop  measures  to  encourage  the  participation  of \nwomen  teachers  in  secondary  education.  The  Project  will  continue  and  expand  the  tested \nstrategies for training and efficient employment of  female   teachers, including those for female \nteaching fellows, developed by  PROMOTE. This strategy is important  for increasing motivation \nof SMCs in sending  female  teachers  for  training,  since  the  strategy  not  only  supports  female \nteachers\u2019 participation, but also provides for a substitute teacher for the school while the female \nteacher  is  undergoing  training.  In  addition,  the  MEd  training  approach  for  teacher  educators \nincludes  flexible  arrangements  to  allow  better  access  also  for  female  teacher  educators.  \nThe MEd training approach is described in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nSocial  Awareness  and  School  Management  Committees.  Community  and  parent \n38. \nparticipation,  together  with  general  public  awareness  of  educational  change,  will  be  promoted \nthrough  a  social  awareness  and  information  program  disseminated  in  meetings,  newspaper \narticles, letters to parents, and television and radio media campaigns. The program will seek to \npromote  a  genuine  dialogue  and  build  support  for  proposed  changes,  and  to  encourage \ncommunity  and  parent  participation,  particularly  in  support  of  teachers  attempting  to  improve \nteaching quality. An awareness training program will be developed for use with SMCs, and other \nparent and support groups, including NGOs, to promote understanding and support for change \nand  improvement  in  teaching  quality.  SMC  training courses and materials designed by SESIP \nand PROMOTE will be utilized where appropriate. The awareness program will include a flexible \nrange of topics. In addition to the paradigm shift in education, for example, topics such as the \nmerits  of  employing  head  teacher  or  teachers  with  adequate  qualification  and  teaching \nexperience, use of learning materials, issues of private tuition, commercial purpose in building \nschools,  issues  of  teachers  working  with  children  from  disadvantaged  groups  etc.,  may  be \nincluded.  Also,  the  merits  of  including  in  SMCs  retired  head  teachers  and  teachers,  and  other \nqualified and experienced members will be addressed. Inclusion in SMCs of female community \nleaders,  elected  women  local  government  representatives,  and  mothers  of  sec ondary school \npupils will be supported. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n39. \nThe  Project  provides  for  comprehensive  development  of  teacher  training  in  secondary \neducation,  and  is  the  first  such  project  in  Bangladesh.  The  Project  will  pursue  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  systemic  developments  required  for  sustainable  improvement  of  quality  of \n\n\f 10\n\nteacher training. The design features emphasize gender and social development as crosscutting \ndimensions  in  its  components.  The  Project's  national  vision  is  to  create  the  environment for \nnationwide improvement in education of teachers for secondary schools. This is important given \nthat  the  Government,  together  with  ADB  and  a  large  group  of  other  development  partners, \nrecently embarked on improving primary education and its quality on a large scale. The demand \nfor  better  teaching  quality,  particularly  in  grades  6\u201310  in  secondary  education  will  increase \nsubstantially due to the increase in the number of primary school graduates, and the improved \nlevel of learning in primary schools.  \n\n \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n40. \nThe total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties,  is  estimated  at  $108.7  million  equivalent.  Of  this  amount,  $37.2  million  equivalent   \n(34% of the total cost) is the foreign exchange cost, and $71.5 million equivalent (66%) is the \nlocal currency cost.

It  is  proposed  that  ADB \n41. \nprovide a loan of $68.9 million in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) \n47,000,000 from its Special Funds resources to finance  63% of the project costs. The amount \ncovers $29.9 million equivalent of the foreign exchange cost and $39.1 million equivalent of the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\nlocal currency cost. The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is planning to provide joint \ngrant cofinancing of $18.0 million (17% of total costs), to be administered by ADB and subject to \nADB  guidelines  and  procedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  services  and  consultant \nselection.  The  external  financing  will  be  used  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  costs  relating  to  civil \nworks,  procurement  of  vehicles,  equipment,  learning resources,  training,  consulting services, \nresearch, and interest  charge during  construction,  but  will  exclude  salaries  of  regular project \nstaff,  rental  of  office  space,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2  and  the \ndetailed financing plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nSource \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nCanadian International Development Agencyb\nGovernment of Bangladesh \n\nTotal \n\n \n29.9 \n   7.3 \n0.0 \n37.2 \n\n \n39.1 \n10.7 \n21.7 \n71.5 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n68.9 \n18.0 \n21.7 \n108.7 \n\nPercent \n\n \n    63a \n         17a \n        20 \n     100 \n\na  Operation  Manual,  section  H3/BP,  para.  10,  states  that,  in  justifiable  cases  in  poorer  Developing  Member \n  Countries (DMCs), the combined  financing by ADB and cofinanciers may exceed the cost-sharing limit. \nb    Joint grant co-financing is subject to final confirmation from Canadian International Development Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nManagement and Coordination \n\n42. \nDSHE, acting under the overall guidance of MOE, will be the Executing Agency (EA) for \nthe Project. DSHE will be accountable for making project implementation adhere to Government \nand  ADB  procedures  and  guidelines,  as  well  as  for  overall  transparency  and  accountability  in \nusing  project  funds.  DSHE  has  satisfactorily  executed  ADB\u2019s  Higher  Secondary  Education \nProject (footnote 4), and the Secondary Education Development Project (footnote 6) and is the \nEA  for  the  ongoing  SESIP  (footnote  2).  DSHE\u2019s  performance  and  capability  for  implementing \nthe Project are considered adequate. \n \n43.  MOE will establish a project steering committee (PSC) to oversee the work of DSHE and \nthe  project  management  unit  (PMU);  and  to  provide  policy  and  strategic  guidance,  and  \ninter-ministerial and interinstitutional coordination of training programs and project interventions. \nThe secretary of MOE will chair the  PSC, and the project director will act as member secretary. \nThe PSC will consist of senior-level representatives from Ministry of Establishment,  Economic \nRelations  Division,  Planning  Commission,  Finance  Division,  Implementation  Monitoring  and \nEvaluation Division, Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, Ministry of Women and Children's \nAffairs,  Ministry  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Food,  Relief  and  Disaster \nManagement,  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Employment,  as  well  as  representation  from  NAEM  and \nBOU.  The  PSC  may  co-opt  other  members  as  necessary.  The  PSC  will  meet  whenever \nnecessary but, in any case, not less than once every quarter.  It will (i) approve annual project \nprogress reports, annual operation plans, as well as the supporting budgets;  (ii) provide overall \npolicy and operational guidance in implementing the Project, and decide on corrective action if \nneeded;  (iii)  undertake  interministerial  coordination  essential  to  achieve  the  reforms  agreed \nupon for teacher training in support of the Project; and (iv) resolve issues and conflicts that may \nemerge  during  project  implementation.  In  addition  to  the  PSC,  a  project  implementation  \n\n\f 12\n\ncommittee to be established will meet at least every second month. It will have representation \nfrom all institutions involved in implementing the Project, and be chaired by the DSHE director \ngeneral.  The  project  director  will  be  a  member  secretary  of  the  implementation  committee.  As \nand when necessary, technical committees may also be formed. \n \nA  PMU  headed  by  a  project  director  with  professional  background  in  education,  and \n44. \nsupported by international and domestic consultants will be established within DSHE. It will be \nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M  &  E)  of  progress.  More  specifically,  the  PMU  will  help  DSHE  to  (i)  prepare  the \nannual  operational  plans;  (ii)  undertake  procurement  activities;  (iii)  prepare  and  maintain \nfinancial  records,  accounts,  and  statements;  (iv)  prepare  all  consolidated  progress  reports, \nincluding  the  midterm  review  (MTR)  report,  as  well  as  the  project  completion  report;                  \n(v) organize project M & E activities; (vi) coordinate the work of the consultants; and (vii) liaise \non project implementation matters with ADB. The PMU will also have a deputy project director \nwith professional background in financial management of projects, as well as officers in charge \nof training, procurement, and M & E. The PMU will have an adequate number of support staff. \nTo  ensure  close  coordination  of  the  project  activities  and  training  programs,  operational \nbranches of the PMU will be established at the major stakeholder institutions of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented for 6 years. Estimated effectiveness date is April 2005, \n\n45. \nand end date is March 2011. An indicative implementation plan is shown in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n46. \nAll local procurement through local competitive bidding (LCB) will take into account the \nrecommendations  of  the  current  Government  procurement  reform,  and  follow  the  new  Public \nProcurement Regulations 2003, acceptable to ADB. Before any procurement starts, the EA will \nsubmit for ADB's approval a list or lists of the goods to be procured, grouping of the  goods, and \nthe proposed number and scope of civil works to be awarded. Indicative procurement packages \nare in Appendix 7. \n \n\na. \n\nCivil Works \n\n47. \nCivil works will focus on upgrading the facilities of secondary education teacher training \ninstitutions  for  effective  use  of  these  facilities  in  implementing  the  improved  teacher  education \nprograms. With support from the Project, facilities for resource centers will be constructed at the \nthree  new  TTCs,  which  are  being  built  by  the  Government.  The  Project  will  support  the \nconstruction of outreach stations or resource centers to improve access to teacher education in \nthe remote and underserved areas. Civil works contracts not exceeding $500,000 are unlikely to \nattract the interest of international contractors and will therefore be awarded by LCB procedures \nas described in Public Procurement Regulations 2003, acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts \nbelow the statement of expenditure limit of $100,000 will be permitted only on a case-by-case \nbasis. Through the PMU, the Government will submit details on the number and scope of civil \nworks  for  ADB  approval,  before  withdrawing  for  any  expenditure  for  civil  works.  Efforts  will  be \nmade  to  limit  the  number  of  contracts,  engage  larger  professional  contractors,  and  award \ncontracts to prequalified contractors to be managed by the Engineering Department of MOE in \naccordance with  Public Procurement Regulations 2003.  The Government has assured that no \nresettlement of people will be involved, other resettlement issues as defined in ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Settlement  will  not  occur,  and  all  contractors  will  comply  with  applicable  labor \nlegislation, including that on child labor.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\n48. \nThe Project will provide equipment and materials to the training institutions and resource \ncenters.  Vehicles  and  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  for  packages  above  $500,000  and  international  shopping  (IS)  for  packages  below \n$500,000, financed from the ADB loan  and CIDA  cofinanced grant funds administered by ADB,  \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Computers,  accessories,  furniture  for \noffices  and  training  institutions,  and  miscellaneous  office  equipment  will  be  procured  through \nLCB  procedures  for  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  in  accordance  with  Public \nProcurement Regulations 2003. To ensure economy and efficiency, goods of similar nature will \nbe grouped into packages under one or more bids. Contracts will be awarded on the basis of a \nleast-cost combination of packages.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n49. \nAll international and associated domestic consultants will be financed from the ADB loan \nand CIDA  cofinanced  grant  funds  administered  by  ADB, and will be selected and engaged  as \none consultancy package  through an international consultancy firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Given the extensive development needs of the teacher education sector \nin  secondary  education  and  the  challenge  to  improve  its  quality  significantly,  the  Project  will \nhave  a  strong  focus  on  capacity  building,  including  intensive  training  in  support  of  faculty \ndevelopment.  Adequate  inputs  through  consultancy  support  will  be  necessary. It is estimated \nthat  at  least  433  person-months  of  international  and  735  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants\u2019  inputs  will  be  necessary  to  support  the  organizational  development  and  capacity \nbuilding  of  NAEM  and  NTRCA,  build  faculty  capacity  across  the  network  of  teacher  training \ninstitutions, and implement other activities of the Project. Given the strong focus of the Project \non  quality  improvement,  it  is  of  utmost  importance  that  the  best  consultants  available  will  be \nselected.  Therefore,  quality-based  selection  (QBS)  method  will  be  used  for  recruitment.            \nIn  addition,  the  Project  includes  a  flexible  provision  for  a  pool  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultancies \nto  meet  additional  needs  possibly  arising  during  project \nimplementation,  including  small  consulting  services  contracts  for  supervision  of  civil  works  for \nwhich domestic consultants will be selected by the EA in accordance with  Public Procurement \nRegulations  2003.  The  indicative  schedule  of  consultancy  inputs  is  in  Supplementary     \nAppendix F. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\nthe  EA \n\nfor \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n50. \nGiven the need to have the Project operating immediately after loan effectiveness, ADB \nhas  approved  advance  action  for  procuring  office  equipment  and  vehicles  for  the  PMU.  The \nGovernment has been advised that advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \nADB will, as requested by the Government and on behalf of the EA, shortlist consultancy firms, \ninvite proposals, and evaluate and rank them. ADB will start shortlisting consulting firms before \nloan approval. The EA will negotiate the contract with the first ranked firm.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nADB  loan  proceeds  and  ADB-administered  CIDA  cofinanced  grant  funds  will  be \nadvanced to the Borrower and deposited in dollar imprest accounts held in a commercial bank \nnominated by the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, and acceptable to ADB. The initial \namount  advanced  to  the  imprest  accounts  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the \nfirst  6  months  of  project  implementation  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.     \n\n\f 14\n\nThe  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and \nADB. The Borrower can then transfer funds from the imprest accounts into the taka account as \nneeded.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  accounts  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Guidelines. SOE procedures will apply to individual payments of less \nthan  $100,000.  On  a  quarterly  basis  or  earlier,  the  EA  can  apply  to  ADB  for  liquidation  or \nreplenishment of the imprest accounts. The withdrawal application must include an SOE. ADB \nwill  review  the  withdrawal  applications  and  will  approve  eligible  expenditures  to  replenish  the \nimprest accounts.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Financial Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  PMU  will  maintain  consistent  records,  accounts,  and  related  financial  statements \n52. \nadequate  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  submit \nquarterly  financial  reports  to  ADB  according  to  ADB\u2019s  rules  and  regulations.  Independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts and related financial statements each \nyear  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and the auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year. The audit report will include the audit of the imprest accounts and SOE, and a \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  their  use.  Additional  financial  audits  and  financial  management  and \nsystems  reviews  may  be  undertaken  through  ADB  in  accordance  with  agreed-upon rules and \nregulations. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\na. \n\nBaseline Survey \n\n53. \nBaseline indicators will be finalized at project inception. The baseline will consist of two \nlevels  of  data:  improvement  in  training  in  teacher  training  colleges  and  institutions,  and \nimprovement  in  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools.  For  this  purpose,  a  cohort  of \nteachers  trained  under  the  Project  will  be  followed  up.  Baseline  data  and  indicators  on \nperformance  required  from  teacher  training  colleges  and  institutions  as  well  as  on  teaching \ncompetencies  and  classroom  management  skills  required  from  teachers  will  be  used.  \nWhen  finalizing  the  indicators,  the  indicators  developed  with  the  assistance  of  SESIP  will  be \nincorporated  where  applicable.  In  addition,  the  database  and  expertise  of  BANBEIS  will  be \nutilized for the baseline design and data collection. Project support will strengthen the capacity \nof DSHE, NAEM, and BANBEIS to plan, analyze, and use baseline data for policy and planning. \nThe outline of the baseline indicators is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n54. \nA comprehensive performance management system will be established for the Project. \nThe project framework, the set of verifiable indicators, and the M & E procedures and systems \nto  be  established  at  the  EA  will  ensure  comprehensive  and  timely  progress  reporting.  The  EA \nwill,  with  support  from  the  PMU,  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports on \nproject implementation, within 3 weeks after the end of each quarter. The progress reports will \nindicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets;  (ii)  problems \nencountered during the period and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve the problems; \n(iii)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (iv) proposed  implementation  activities  to  be \nundertaken  and  physical  and  financial  progress  expected  during  the  succeeding  quarter, \nincluding detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. The EA will prepare a project \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  performance  management  system  will  determine  whether \n\ncompletion report and submit it to ADB not later than 3 months after physical completion of the \nProject.  The  report  will  analyze  overall  progress,  achievement  of  outputs  and  compliance  with \nthe loan covenants, and will include costs. \n \n55. \nfor \nimplementing project activities have yielded the expected outputs and benefits to the intended \nbeneficiaries. The data will be disaggregated according to gender, and will also indicate project \nprogress in improving the access of disadvantaged groups as well as participants from remote \nareas  to  teacher  training.  The  system  will  seek  to  detect  any  deficiency  in  and  discrepancy \nbetween  the  operational  plan  and  execution  in  using  the  resources  efficiently,  so  that  timely \ncorrections  can  be  made  to  update  the  plans  to  improve  benefits,  outcomes,  and  impact. \nInformation  from  progress  reports,  annual  reviews,  the  MTR,  and  from  external  M  &  E  will  be \nalso utilized.  \n \n\ninputs \n\nthe \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\na. \n\nAnnual Reviews  \n\n56. \nThe  Government,  ADB,  and  CIDA  will  jointly  review  project  progress  annually  to \ndetermine compliance with specific loan covenants and whether all required inputs and support \nfunctions on the Government side are in place. The review will also evaluate the effectiveness \nof implementation mechanisms. Reviews will specifically (i) analyze the results of the previous \nyear, (ii) identify adjustments needed, (iii) assess the impact of the Project on poverty reduction, \n(iv)  assess  project  contributions  to  improving  the  quality  of  teacher  education  in  secondary \neducation,  (v)  assess  implementation  performance  against  agreed-upon indicators and adjust \nindicators  as  needed,  (vi)  identify  policy  issues  in  teacher  education  in  secondary  education, \nand  (vii)  identify  constraints  to  project  implementation.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  \n(i) the effectiveness of project strategies for promoting greater participation of female students \nand  students  from  disadvantaged  groups  and  remote  areas,  (ii)  progress  on  key  project \ninnovations, and (iii) coordination of project interventions. \n \n\nb. \n\nMidterm Review  \n\n57. \nThe Government,  ADB, and CIDA will jointly undertake an MTR during year 3 of project \nimplementation  to  assess  progress  in  meeting  the  long-term  vision  for  teacher  education  in \nsecondary  education  in  Bangladesh.  The  MTR  will  evaluate  (i)  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  institutional  changes;  (ii)  implementation  progress  against \nagreed-upon indicators; (iii) procurement performance; (iv) PMU effectiveness; (v) performance \nof  consultants;  (vi)  fund  flows  and  arrangements;    (vii)  progress  in  implementing  the  gender \nstrategy; (viii) lessons learned; and (ix) other issues agreed upon by the Government, ADB, and \nCIDA. One month before the MTR, the EA will submit to ADB a comprehensive report covering \nthe  above  issues.  Feedback  on  project  implementation  will  be  sought  from  civil  society  during \nthe  MTR.  The  MTR  will  recommend  changes  in  project  design  and  implementation,  \nas necessary.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\n58. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  systemic  improvement  in  delivery  of  teacher  training  in \nsecondary  education,  and  its  planning,  management,  and  monitoring.  The  improvements will \nestablish  the  necessary  foundation  for  more  efficient  and  effective  teacher  training  and \n\n\f 16\n\nimprovement  in  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  in  secondary  schools.  Key  improvements  that \nwill contribute to the sustainable development of better quality secondary education include the \ndevelopment  of  high  quality  initial  and  in-service  training  programs  for  teachers  and  head \nteachers.  Quality  improvements  will  include  also  improved  training  materials  and  facilities.  \nThe  training  programs  will  ensure  greater  use  of  classroom  practices  that  are  appropriate  for \nteaching  and  learning  in  secondary  education.  In  support  of  project  implementation,  \nthe  Government  will  introduce  compulsory  teacher  qualification  requirements  in  secondary \neducation. This is likely to create more demand for better organized teacher training, particularly \namong the vast numbers of untrained teachers in secondary education. As 30% of the teachers \nwill reach retirement age at project completion or soon after, the efficiency and benefits of the \ninvestment  will  further  be  achieved  by  prioritizing  teachers  under  40  years  of  age  for  training \nunder  the  Project.  Ensuring  that  these  improvements  reach  beyond  the  urban  areas  to  the \nfurthest  regions  will  help  overcome  the  barriers  caused  by  remoteness  and  geography.  \nAccess of candidates from remote areas and disadvantaged groups to teacher training will be \nsupported.  However,  none  of  these  improvements  will  be  sustainable  without  enhanced \ncapacity and efficiency of the teacher training system. The long-term benefits will be improved \norganizational  and  institutional  development,  human  resource  development  strategies  for \nteacher  training,  and  the  provision  of  additional  financial  and  other  resources  that  will  ensure \ngreater long-term sustainability of secondary teacher training, both technically and financially.  \n \nThe Project  will  further  improve  access  by  female  candidates,  and  the  proportion  of \n59. \nfemale  teachers  is  planned  to  reach  30%  during  the  Project  from  the  current  proportion  17%. \nAppropriate  gender  dimensions,  and  gender  equality  training  and  social  development \ndimensions  will  be  incorporated  and  mainstreamed  in  the  teacher  training  programs  and \nmaterials.  The  role  of  women  as  members  of  SMCs  will  be  supported.  The  role  of  SMC s in \nsupporting improvement of teaching quality will be part of the project efforts at grassroots level. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy form is in Appendix 8. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  indirectly.  The indirect beneficiaries are \n60. \npupils  in  secondary  schools  who  will  benefit  from  the  improved  teaching  skills  of  teachers. \nImprovement  in  teaching  quality  will  further  improve  learning  by  pupils,  resulting  in  better \neducation outcomes and better performance  in the labor market. Details of the poverty impact \nassessment are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n  \n61. \nOverall,  the  estimated  immediate  beneficiaries  in  secondary  education  are  the  \n(i) 100,000 serving untrained teachers (below 40 years of age) who will be trained as teachers, \n(ii)  all  50,000  new  teachers  who  will  benefit  from  training  at  TTCs  and  institutions  using  new \ntraining  methods  and  delivery  modes,  (iii)  all  17,000  head  teachers  who  will  benefit  from  the \nupgraded  head  teacher  training,  (iv)  over  200,000  serving  teachers  who  will  benefit  from \nprofessional development programs introduced by the Project, and (v) over 700 teacher trainers \nwho will benefit from professional development they receive. The ultimate beneficiaries will be \nthe pupils in grades 6\u201310, estimated at 9.5 million by the end of the project period. \n  \nB. \n\nRisk Analysis \n\n62. \nThe  design  of  the  Project  draws  heavily  from  the  lessons  learned  from  previous \ninterventions.  Implementation  will  be  supported  through  the  comprehensive  policy  and \ninstitutional  reform  matrix  with  linkages  to  the  loan  assurances.  While  the  Government  is \ncommitted  to  these  reforms,  there  is  a  risk  that  a  future  Government  could  reverse  this \ncommitment.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  fact  that  the  reforms  are  linked  with  wider  long-term \ndevelopment frameworks in the sector and beyond, with the national poverty reduction strategy, \nand the medium-term macroeconomic framework (MTMF).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n63. \nThere is also a risk that the Government may not be able to allocate adequate financial \ncounterpart  resources  for  the  Project.  Therefore,  as  part  of  the  risk  mitigation  analysis  and \npreparation of the financial plan,  financial affordability and sustainability of the proposed  Project \nwas  analyzed  based  on  the  MTMF  in  National  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth,  Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Development,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Staff  Report,  and \nBangladesh  Public  Expenditure  Review. As  a  result  of  the  administrative  changes,  upgraded \ntraining facilities, and training grants introduced by the proposed  Project, there is a direct cost \nimplication in the recurrent budget for teacher training after the project period. Approximately an \nadditional Tk17 million will be required. In addition, it is estimated that another Tk28 million will \nbe necessary every 5 years after the project period to cover the cost of major maintenance of \nbuildings and furniture. These amounts can be sufficiently financed  through the proposed 10% \nannual  increase  in real terms  in  the  teacher  training  budget.  A corresponding assurance has \nbeen  included  in  the  loan  agreement.  Given  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  teacher  training \nbudget,  the  required  increase  would  be  only  about  Tk30  million  by  the  end  of  the  Project.   \nSuch an increase can be absorbed by the increase in the overall secondary education budget. \nIn  terms  of  indirect  cost  implications,  changes  in  the  teacher  qualification  policy  during  the \nproject period  will  lead  to  salary  increase  from  untrained  to  trained  teacher  pay  scale levels. \nThere  will  be  approximately  133,000    more  trained  teachers  by  2011  (including training both \nserving  untrained  teachers  and  new  teachers).  It  is  estimated  that  the  increase in  number of \ntrained teachers will require  approximately an additional Tk503 million to Tk1,436 million by the \nend of the Project, depending  on how many teachers who receive initial training will  continue to \nBEd  level  training.  In addition,  depending  on  the  salary  level  of  teachers  working  in  remote \nareas, indirect costs in the range of Tk285 million\u2013Tk327 million will be incurred in providing the \nproposed incentives for secondary school teachers in remote areas. The total additional budget \nrequirement  as  a  result  of  indirect  costs  will  be  in  range  of  Tk788  million\u2013Tk1,763  million.  \nSuch  increase  can  be  absorbed  by  increments  in  the  secondary  education  budget  between \n2005 and 2011 under the base case scenario, based on ADB and IMF analysis of the economy. \nThe summary of the economic and financial analyses is in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n64. \nThere is a risk that no sufficient demand for teacher training may materialize. By project \neffectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  approved  a  policy  requiring  that  all  new  secondary \nteachers  must  be  trained  to  a  minimum  1  year  BEd  level  and  no  untrained  teachers  will  be \nappointed  to  teacher  posts  in  secondary  schools  after  2007.  The  policy  will  increase  the \ndemand  and  motivation  of  untrained  teachers  for  training.  However,  the  opportunity  costs  of \nfemale  teachers  and  teachers  from  remote  areas  or  other  disadvantaged  groups  may  be  too \nhigh. This risk is mitigated by providing training grants for participants from these groups, and a \nsalary incentive for teachers in remote areas. The strategy tested by  PROMOTE, which will be \ncontinued  by  the  proposed  Project,  is  important  for motivating SMCs to send female teachers \nfor  training,  since  the  strategy  supports  not  only  female  teachers\u2019  participation,  but  also  the \nprovision of a substitute teacher for the school while the female teacher is in training.  \n \n65. \nEstablishing  and  building  capacity  of  the  NTRCA,  and  developing  of  appropriate \ntransparent procedures in this area are expected to significantly mitigate the risk of abuse and \nrent-seeking  in  the  hiring  practices  in  private  secondary  schools.  Currently  the  Government \nprovides  90%  salary  subvention  to  teachers  in  private  secondary  schools.  Currently  the \nsubvention system is not effectively linked with quality assurance indicators at school level and \nso  result  in  wastage  of  resources  and  poor  governance.  Recruitment  of  trained, qualified, and \nregistered head teachers and teachers by the private secondary schools will be linked with the \nsubvention provided by the Government for these schools. This will further significantly mitigate \nthe  risk  of  abuse  and  rent-seeking.  As  part  of  development  of  teacher  training  programs,  and \ntheir  accreditation,  the  end  objective  of  the  training,  i.e.,  \"better\"  teachers  with  improved \nteaching competencies and classroom management skills, will be defined in detail. Similarly, the \n\n\f 18\n\nobjectives  of  head  teacher  training  will  be  further  improved.  These  objectives  will  provide \nindicators  for  monitoring  the  efficiency  and  outcome  of  training,  and  also  for  quality  control  of \nteaching  in  schools  after  the  training.  Further  professional  development  events  and  programs \nwill be provided to support trained teachers and head teachers in improving their performance \n \nThe Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant adverse impacts \n66. \nwere identified. However,  if science laboratories in the teacher training colleges and institutions \nunder  the  Project  will  involve  the  handling  and  disposal  of  toxic  and  hazardous  substances, \nmitigating measures, that may include the development of environmental and safety manuals on \nthe use, handling, and disposal of these substances will be implemented.  \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n67. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nWithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will have (a) standardized \nthe syllabus prepared with SESIP support, for a 1-year modular BEd course for \nuse in government and private TTCs and training institutions, including BOU; and  \n(b)  adopted  a  basic  3-month  in-service  training  course  leading  to  a  certificate \n(Teacher  Training  Certificate  Module)  as  one  of  the  modules  of  the  1-year BEd \ncourse  for  training  untrained  secondary  school  teachers.  The  Teacher  Training \nCertificate Module will be compulsory for all untrained secondary school teachers \nunder the age of 40. \n\n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  developed  a \ntime-bound  action  plan  on  approving  and  implementing  a  written  policy  on \nawarding  35%  of  the  existing  BEd  increment  (i.e.  enhancement  in  salary \nsubvention)  to  the  secondary  school  teachers  who  complete  the  Teacher \nteachers. \nTraining  Certificate  Module  and  are \nImplementation  of  the  policy  will  begin  by  the  end  of  the  first  year  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n\nregistered  as  qualified \n\n \n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  (a)  made  a \nwritten  policy  decision  on  transforming  and  restructuring  NAEM  to  become  the \ninstitutional home of excellence for teacher training in secondary education  with \nstaffing  and  budget  acceptable  to  ADB;  and  (b)  developed  a  time-bound action \nplan for institutional and organizational analysis, to be completed within 1 year of \nloan effectiveness, focusing on transforming and restructuring NAEM.  \n\n(iv)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have:  (a)  made  a \nwritten policy decision to form the NTRCA with staffing and budget acceptable to \nADB;  and  (b)  developed  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  institutional  and \norganizational  analysis,  to  be  completed  within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness, \nfocusing on the establishment of the NTRCA.  \n\n(v)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  (a)  extended  a \ncurrent  incentive  package,  provided  to  government  employees  in  CHT,  remote \nand underserved areas, to trained secondary teachers who serve in these areas \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nor represent ethnic minorities;  and  (b) made a written policy decision  providing \nadditional  or  enhanced  training  grants  for  secondary  school  teachers  from \nremote and underserved areas or representing ethnic minorities.  \n\n(vi)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  approved  a \nteachers  must  undergo \n\nwritten  policy  requiring \ncompulsory initial training designed for head teachers.   \n\nthat  all  untrained  head \n\n(vii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  prepared  a \ntime-bound  action  plan  for  (a)  filling  at  least  75%  of  vacant  posts  of  lecturers, \nassistant professors, and associate professors in TTCs, and equivalent positions \nin HSTTIs, and SESDCs, by the end of year 2 of loan effectiveness, and 100% \nby MTR; (b) creating senior positions in teacher training institutions by upgrading \na  proportion  of  existing  junior  positions  by  MTR;  and  (c)  establishing  functional \nteacher specialization within the education cadre by the end of the year 2 of loan \neffectiveness. \n\n(viii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  established  a \nseparate  budget  line  for  teacher  education  and  training  in  the  secondary \neducation  budget,  and  increased  its  recurrent  budget  for  teacher  education  and \ntraining  in  secondary  education,  including  costs  and  expenses  associated  with \nthe establishment, staffing and operations of the NTRCA, in real value by at least \n10% per annum for each year of the project period. \n\n(ix)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  approved  a \nwritten policy that after 2007, only trained, registered secondary school teachers \nwill be eligible for salary subvention; and that only secondary schools that employ \nqualified, experienced, and trained head teachers/assistant head teachers will be \neligible for school registration and subvention.  \n\n(x)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have  prepared  a \ntime-bound  action  plan  for  provision  of  compulsory  in-service  professional \ndevelopment  training  for  all  secondary  school  teachers,  both  trained  and \nuntrained,  through  the  network  of  public  training  institutes,  and  selected  private \nTTCs starting from 2006. \n\n \n(xi) \n\nBy the end of year 1 of loan effectiveness, the Government will have developed a \ntime-bound action plan for providing special training for teachers who will serve in \nsecondary schools for children from various disadvantaged groups such as the \ndisabled, ethnic minorities, and refugees.   \n\n \n(xii)  By  the  end  of  the  Project,  at  least  30%  of  teaching  positions  will  be  filled  by \nwomen.

Over  8.6  million  students  are  enrolled  in  over  18,000  secondary \neducation  schools,  including  madrasah  (religious)  schools,  recognized  by  the  Government. \nEnrollments at the secondary education level have more than tripled since 1980. The growth in \ngirls' enrollment is commendable\u2014from about 600,000 in 1980 to over 4 million by 2000. Girls \nnow  constitute  about  55%  of  enrollment  at  the  secondary  level.  Over  the  same  period,  the \nnumber of secondary education institutions also doubled. \n \n2. \nNotwithstanding  the  quantitative  achievements,  weaknesses  in  the  secondary  system \nare reflected in the declining quality of graduates and teachers. About 60% of teachers are still \nuntrained,  while  most  schools  are  devoid  of  standard  conditions  essential  for  the  normal \ninstructional  process.  Standard  cohort  analysis  over  the  entire  secondary  education  cycle \nreveals  the  extent  of  wastage  in  the  system  in  the  form  of  failure  and  dropout  rates.    Dropout \nrates  average  44%  for  secondary  grades  6\u201310  (49%  for  girls)  and  38%  for  higher  secondary \ngrades  11\u201312  (36%  for  girls).  Pass  rates  for  the  secondary  school  certificate  (SSC)  declined \nfrom  55%  in  1999  to  36%  in  2003.  Pass  rates  for  the  higher  secondary  certificate  (HSC) \ndeclined from 56% in 1999 to 27% in 2002, with a slightly improved result 38% in 2003. Such \nfailure rates represent a huge wastage of financial resources. Poor and disadvantaged students \nare  most  affected  since  they  rarely  have  other  educational  options  and  cannot  afford  the  fees \ncharged for private additional tuition.  \n \nB. \n\nSecondary Education System Management \n\nSchool Establishment and Registration Criteria. About 98% of secondary schools are \n3. \nnongovernment  schools,  with  a  school  management  committee  (SMC)  overseeing  their \nadministration.  Although  private,  these  schools,  including  private  madrasah  schools,  receive \nsubstantial  government  subsidies:  90%  of  salaries  for  teachers,  and  block  grants  for \nconstruction  and  maintenance.  Since  2003,  the  authority  approving  applications  has  been  the \nboards  of  intermediate  and  secondary  education  (BISEs).  The  criteria  for  granting  approval \nrelate to several indicators: distance from nearest school, physical state of the classrooms and \nlibrary, laboratory equipment, teacher qualifications, etc. Once a school has existed for 3 years,   \nit  becomes   eligible  for  recognition,  i.e.,  receiving  government  subvention.  Recognition  is \ngoverned by the criteria mentioned above, along with performance in the standardized grade 10 \nSSC examinations.  At least 50% of students should have passed the SSC examination. \n \nDue to the sharp increase in the number of secondary schools and the limited capacity \n4. \nto  effectively  monitor  the  establishment  and  registration  of  private  secondary  schools,  the \ncriteria  are  not  well  enforced.  As  part  of  the  planned  education  sector  reform,1  Ministry  of \nEducation  (MOE)  aims  to  implement  an  approach  where  competitively  selected  private  sector \nservice providers will be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating the readiness of schools \nand  colleges  for  establishment  or  recognition,  based  on  criteria  established  by  MOE.  \nWhile  the  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (DSHE)  and  BISE  will  remain \n                                                 \n1 The International Development Association (IDA) will support the reform through a programmatic sector  adjustment \ncredit, approved by IDA in 2004. The subsector analysis presents those reform dimensions particularly, which have \nlinkages to the teacher education sector in secondary education.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 27\n\nGovernment  Subvention  of  Private  Secondary  Schools.  Once  a  school \n\nresponsible  for  overseeing  the  process  and  conducting  random  inspection,  reports  from  the \nservice providers will become the primary basis for establishing and registering schools. \n \n5. \nis \nrecognized,  it  receives  monthly  government  subventions.  This  system,  which  is  known  as  the \nMonthly  Pay  Order  system  prescribes  a  fixed  and  uniform  proportion  of  salary  grants  to  be \nextended  to  all  nongovernment  teachers  and  employees  of  all  recognized  educational \ninstitutions.  The  subvention  currently  covers  90%  of  the  salaries  of  teaching  staff  in \nnongovernment  schools.  To  ensure  that  schools  have  an  incentive  to  maintain  a  high  level  of \nperformance, the subventions are meant to be linked to performance criteria and are supposed \nto  be  discontinued  should  a  school  not  meet  minimum  performance  criteria  for  a  period  of  5 \nyears.  As  part  of  the  education  sector  reform  agenda,  the  procedure  for  subvention  is  being \nstrengthened to enhance transparency. MOE has informed poorly performing schools that their \nsubvention will be terminated if they do not improve. The subvention will be linked more clearly \nto results of standardized examinations. The examination system will be reformed to become a \nmore effective system of student assessment.2 In addition, examination results and the names \nof the schools not meeting the performance criteria will be published. \n\n6. \nMOE has recognized that the subvention criterion in the current form may lead to greater \ninequity in access, with the poorer areas being most adversely affected. MOE aims to improve \nthe situation by better identifying areas that are underserved, and discourage establishment and \nsubvention of new schools in areas that may have a higher number of secondary schools than \nis  necessary  in  the  light  of  the  size  of  the  population  of  secondary  school-age  students. \nStrengthening  the  capacity  of  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Educational  Information  and  Statistics \n(BANBEIS) in school mapping studies, tracking cohort flow, and data analysis and interpretation \nin support of MOE\u2019s and DSHE\u2019s policy formulation will be important.  \n \n7. \nAs  part  of  the  education  sector  reform,  MOE  aims  to  shift  toward  a  grants-based \nfinancing  system,  linking  resource  allocation  more  closely  to  student  enrollment,  examination \nperformance, and teacher attendance.  Instead of directly receiving salaries, schools would be \ngiven  tuition  grants,  which  can  be  used  for  salaries  and  other  inputs,  particularly  those  for \nimproving  the  quality  of  education.  This  system  will  improve  flexibility  and  possibilities  for \nschools in choosing the right balance between salaries and other inputs.  In this direction, under \nthe female stipend programs in Bangladesh, an approach has already been successfully piloted \nwhere girls in rural areas are given a stipend to attend a school of their choice and the school \nreceives  the  tuition  for  each  supported  student.  ADB\u2019s  current  loan  project  in  secondary \neducation3  also  includes  a  significant  stipend  component  for  poor  and  female  students  in \nsecondary education. \n \n8. \nCentralized  Authority.  The  capacity  of  MOE  to  supervise  and  monitor  secondary \nschools has not increased in line with the rapid increase in the number schools. The tendency of \ncentralized  authority  has  further  exacerbated  the  problem.  As  part  of  the  education  sector \nreform,  MOE  aims  to  move  toward  a  devolved  system  of  governance,  where  the  central \nGovernment will be responsible for formulating policies, financing, setting quality standards, and \nmonitoring and evaluation, and lower levels of Government  will be responsible for administering \nthe system and monitoring school performance.   \n\n                                                 \n2   Concurrently, the Second Primary  Education Development Program, where the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \n\nthe lead agency, includes initiatives for improving student assessment in primary education. \n\n3  ADB. 1999.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n \n\nthe People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nin  all \n\nrequired \n\n(GBs)  are \n\nSMCs  and  college  governing  bodies \n\n \n9. \nrecognized \nnongovernment  secondary  schools  and  intermediate  colleges,  respectively.  While  it  is \nunrealistic to assume that these bodies have the expertise to monitor teaching quality, they can \nhave a critical role in hiring teachers, and monitoring school performance and the presence of \nstudents and teachers during school hours. These functions become even more crucial, given \nthe lack of government capacity below the central level.  \n \nBecause SMCs and GBs are often composed predominantly of male elites and can be \n10. \nsubject to political interference, there is an apparent lack of interest among community members \nand  guardians  to  participate  in  SMCs/GBs.  Thus,  the  accountability  of  the  school  toward  the \ncommunity  is  undermined.  As  part  of  the  education  reform  agenda,  MOE  aims  to  empower \ndistrict  and  upazila  (subdistrict)  officers  to  take  greater  responsibility  in  monitoring  school \nperformance  and  ensure  public  disclosure  of  information.  To  this  end,  the  Prime  Minister \nauthorized in 2003 the establishment of district and upazila advisory committees, with authority \nto monitor school performance and ensure public disclosure of information. ADB\u2019s current loan \nproject (footnote 3) has a strong focus on decentralized secondary education management and \nbuilding  the  capacity  of  SMCs  and  district\u2013and  upazila  level  officers  in  carrying  out  their  roles \nmore efficiently. \n \nInformation  Dissemination  and  Evaluation  of  Performance.  BANBEIS  produces \n11. \nvaluable  data  on  secondary  education  and  recently  completed  a  comprehensive  school \nmapping  exercise,  which  provides  information  on  school  facilities,  teachers,  and  results  of \nstandardized examinations. However, coordination between BANBEIS and the planning unit in \nMOE needs to be strengthened to ensure more effective use of data for planning. More focus is \nalso  needed  on  evaluating  school  performance  and  feeding  the  results  into  decision  making, \nand disseminating them to stakeholders\u2014parents, students, and school management \u2014to allow \nthem  to  compare  their  schools  with  other  schools.  Further  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nBANBEIS for school mapping studies, tracking cohort flow, and analyzing and interpreting data \nin  support  of  DSHE\u2019s  and  MOE\u2019s  policy  formulation  will  be  important.  Similarly  building  the \ncapacity  of  MOE  and  DSHE  staff  in  interpreting  and  using  of  BANBEIS  data  for  policy  and \nplanning is necessary. \n \nC. \n\n \nOrganizational  Reforms  for  Coordinated  Delivery  of  Teache r  Training,  and \nRegistration and Accreditation of Teachers Trained \n\n1 2 .  \n\nEffective  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training  are  key  to  developing  better \n12. \nteachers.  A  number  of  organizations,4  including  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs),  higher \nsecondary  education  teacher  training  institutes  (HSTTIs),  secondary  education  science \ndevelopment  centers  (SESDCs),  Madrasah  Teacher  Training  Institute  (MMTI),  as  well  as \nNational  Academy  of  Educational  Management  (NAEM),  National  University  (NU),  and \nBangladesh  Open  University  (BOU),  are  currently  involved  in  providing  different  aspects  of \nteacher  training  in  secondary  education.  However,  coordination  and  institutional  linkage \nbetween  them  are  clearly  lacking.  To  overcome  this  problem,  the  education  reform \nrecommendations  include  transformation/restructuring  NAEM  to  become  the  institutional  home \nof excellence for secondary education teacher training. NAEM will be responsible for managing \nand  coordination  secondary  education \nIn  addition,  a \nNongovernment  Teachers  Registration  and  Certification  Agency  (NTRCA)  will  be  established. \n\ntraining  nationwide. \n\nteacher \n\n                                                 \n4  In  all,  there  are  currently  about  70  institutions  providing  teacher  training  in  secondary  education  (25  public \n\ninstitutions and 54 private institutions). They provide training of variable quality. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 29\n\nNTRCA  will  be  responsible  for  certifying,  registering,  and  deploying  all  qualified  teachers  and \nhead teachers in secondary education, and accrediting teacher training programs.5  \n \n13. \nUnder  the  NAEM,  a  national  integrated  teacher  training  system  will  be  established  for \nsecondary education to link all levels of the training network from the central administration to \nthe schools,  and to  coordinate  and  manage  teacher  qualification  and  training.  NAEM  will  be \nresponsible for overseeing teacher training, and will become the institutional home of excellence \nfor teacher training in secondary education subsector.  \n\n \n14. \nTeachers in Government schools are recruited by DSHE in accordance with rules of the \nGovernment  and  MOE,  while  head  teachers  are  recruited  as  civil  servants  through  the  Public \nServices  Commission  and  deployed  by  the  Government.  Teachers  for  private  schools  are \nrecruited directly by the school. The appointments procedure is clearly laid out in Government \nrules  and  regulations  and  the  SMCs  are  responsible  for  supervising  the  appointments \nprocedure. However, corruption and nepotism have undermined the transparency of the system. \nThe objective of education sector reform is to develop a transparent and high-quality system of \nteacher recruitment and teacher training guided by agreed upon criteria and standards.  While it \nis difficult to improve the quality of all teachers in the short term, it is possible to begin to tackle \nthe problem of poorly qualified new teachers entering the system.  \n \nTo ensure adherence to a standardized and transparent criteria in teacher recruitment, \n15. \nMOE  is  in  process  of  establishing  the  NTRCA.  The  main  function  of  NTRCA  will  be  to  certify \nand register a pool of trained, and qualified teachers and head teachers, and accredit teacher \ntraining programs. All schools that receive subvention from the Government will have to recruit \nnew  teachers/head  teachers  from  the  pool  selected  by  NTRCA. Certification will be based on \nacademic qualifications and a standardized examination conducted on an annual basis. The list \nof  certified  teachers/headteachers  will  be  published  and  made  available  to  all  schools. SMCs \nwill  still  retain  the  authority  and  flexibility  to  recruit  teachers,  but  these  teachers  must  be \nselected from the prequalified pool. The formal establishment of NTRCA will require approval by \nParliament,  and  the  NTRCA  is  expected  to  be  functional  in  2005. The reform aims to ensure \nthat teachers and head teachers meet basic entry standards, and to also significantly reduce the \nscope for corruption and nepotism in selecting teachers. \n  \n16. \nThe  Government  already  has  a  policy  for  providing  increment  in  the  salary  of  existing \nteachers  who  completed  their  Bachelor  of  Education  (BEd)  training  to  qualify  as  a  teacher.  In \naddition,  Parliament  passed  a  legislation  granting  pensions  to  private  secondary  school \nteachers.  In  parallel,  MOE  is  developing  a  time-bound  action  plan  addressing  issues  on  the \nprovision of incentives to teachers, which it expects to implement by 2005/06. \n \n17. \nAs  part  of  the  reforms,  teacher  standards  in  the  private  and  public  schools  will  be \nharmonized.  Private  schools  will  adopt  standards  already  in  place  for  Government  secondary \nschools.

Bangladesh has shown strong national commitment to education. In recent years, Bangladesh has \nmade major strides in the education sector.  The increased allocation to education in the development budget during \nthe last 2 years reflects the commitment of the Government and donor community to the field of education. Over the \nlast  decade,  the  total  recurrent  expenditure  for  the  secondary  education  subsector  as  a  percentage  of  total \ngovernment recurrent expenditure on education has increased. The allocation for the secondary and higher secondary \neducation subsector for 2002\u20132003 represents about 41.6% of the total education budget.  The Ministry of Education\u2019s \nPerspective  Plan  for  1995\u20132010  identifies  the  general  objectives  for  the  postprimary  subsector.  They  include  (i) \nattaining  universal  secondary  education  with  emphasis  on  work-oriented  education,  (ii)  improving  education  at  all \nlevels,  (iii)  accelerated  expansion  of  female  education  at  all  levels,  (iv)  making  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining more job oriented, and (v) reducing the rural-urban gaps in education facilities.   \n \nGross  enrollment  rates  at  the  secondary  level  have  significantly  increased,  and  the  introduction  of  the  female \nsecondary  stipend  program  has  virtually  eliminated  gender  disparity,  at  least  up  to  the  secondary  school  certificate \n(SSC) course level. Currently Bangladesh has approximately 18,677 secondary schools with 9.4 million students. Out \nof the total, 4.6 million are boys and 4.7 million are girls. The gross enrollment rate in secondary education averages \nabout  30%,  marked  by  significant  losses  as  grades  advance,  i.e.,  38%  in  junior secondary, 25% in secondary, and \n19% in higher secondary education. Teachers in the secondary schools number about 240,000.    \n \nDespite  significant  progress  in  providing  more  students  with  access  to  secondary  education,  a  weakness  in  the \nsecondary system  is  reflected  in  the  declining  quality  of  graduates  and  teachers.  Secondary  education  is  generally \nintended  for  the  11\u201317  years  old.  According  to  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Educational  Information  and  Statistics \n(BANBEIS),  dropout  rates  average  44%  for  grades  6\u201310  (49%  for  girls)  and  38%  for  grades  11\u201312 (36% for girls). \nPass  rates  for  the  SSC  and  higher  secondary  certificate  (HSC)  have  been  declining  since  1999.  In  2001,  students \npassing the grade 10 SSC and grade 12 HSC examinations were 35.22% and 28.41%, respectively.  The decline in \nthe quality of education can be partly attributed to poor teaching. In the past, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nassisted  the  Government  in  establishing  a  basis  for  teacher  education  through  several  projects  including  the \nestablishment of teacher training colleges (TTCs), secondary education science development centers (SESDCs), and \nhigher  secondary  teacher  training  institutes  (HSTTIs).  However,  60%  of  the  teachers  are  still  untrained  and  most \nschools  lack  standard  conditions essential for the normal instructional process. About 98% secondary schools are \nprivate  schools.  Most  of  the  private  schools  do  not  follow  government  procedures  in  recruiting  teachers  and \nmaintaining  quality  standards  for  teaching.  Many  secondary  schools  are  in  deplorable  physical  condition  with \ninadequate facilities. The problems in secondary education are multifaceted and include inadequate teacher training, \nweak  training  methodology  and  inadequate  curriculum,  poor  performance  of  teachers,  high  percentage of untrained \nteachers, lack of proper inspection and monitoring of teachers performance, poor teaching and learning environment, \nand overcrowded classrooms. The school curriculum, the examination system, and quality of textbooks are all related \nissues that are being addressed in depth by the on-going ADB-supported Secondary Education Sector Improvement \nProject (SESIP).   \n \nThe goal of the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project is to enhance the quality of education \nin Bangladesh secondary schools by improving the quality of teaching. The purpose is to provide quality initial and in-\nservice  teacher  training,  including  continuing  professional  development,  to  all  eligible  teachers  of  grades  6-10 in \ngovernment and private secondary schools. The Project will emphasize the quality of teaching methodology as well as \nthe  learning  environment,  which  influences  quality,  standard  of  teaching,  and  school  performance.  The  Project  will \naddress access to quality teaching by the poor, the disadvantaged, ethnic minorities, and refugee children.  \n \nThe Project will also provide training to untrained teachers in madrasah secondary schools, and this training will have \na significant effect on the madrasah school system. Better trained teachers and students from madrasah schools will \nhave a positive impact on social dynamics in the communities.  \n \n\nContinued on next page\n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nQuality secondary education will improve employment opportunities for young persons, especially for girls. Education \nand employment opportunities for girls would delay marriage and lead to fewer children. Access to quality secondary \neducation by the poor, the disadvantaged, ethnic minorities, and refugee children will enhance their competencies and \nchances for higher secondary and college education and employment opportunities. \n \nB.     Poverty Analysis                                                                 Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention1 \n\n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nBangladesh,  with  a  population  of  132  million  and  per  capita  gross  national  product  of  $350,  is  one  of  the  poorest \ncountries  in  the  world.  However,  estimates  based  on  a  household  expenditure  survey  indicate  that  the  incidence  of \nincome  poverty  has  declined  from  over  70%  of  the  population  in  1973  to  an  estimated  36%  in  2001. Progress has \nbeen made in improving Bangladesh\u2019s human poverty index. Between 1992 and 1998, the index increased by 49%, \nwith marked improvements in life expectancy, adult literacy, gross primary school enrollment ratio; and decreases in \ninfant mortality  rates,  total  fertility  rates,  and  dropout  rates  in  primary  schools.  These  results  were  achieved  through \ncontinued efforts of the Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to expand the coverage of essential \nservices to the disadvantaged sections of society. Yet, Bangladesh faces severe deficiencies in the quality of health, \nnutrition, and education. The majority of the poor (about 80%) live in rural areas and most are illiterate. Most of the \nbenefits  of  secondary  education  are  enjoyed  by  comparatively  better-off  families.  The  vast  majority  of  the  students \nwho leave and remain outside the secondary education system belong to various disadvantaged groups, including the \npoor,  and  landless  or  marginal  farmers  in  rural  areas,  urban  slum  dwellers,  children of ethnic minorities, refugees, \ndisabled children, and girls.   \n \nThe Government has attempted to ensure adequate access to basic social services, including secondary education, \nas  one  of  the  key  strategies  for  reducing  poverty.  The  Project  will  improve  secondary  school  teaching  quality  and \ncreate a teaching environment that is conducive to learning and the retention of students within the school system. \nThe knowledge and skills the students will acquire will translate into social and economic benefits .  \n \nThe  project  component  equitable  access  and  community  involvement\u2014will include interventions to increase access \nfor  underserved  areas  and  disadvantaged  groups.  In  both  initial  and  in-service  training  to  teachers,  priority  will  be \ngiven to improving teaching quality in the remote and underserved areas. Three outreach stations or satellite teacher \nresource  centers  will  be  established  to  improve  access  to  teacher  education  in  remote  districts  such  as  Rangamati, \nPatuakhali, and Thakurgaon. To encourage teachers in remote areas, a teacher deployment policy will be developed. \nSpecial  teaching  and  learning  materials  will  be  prepared  for  teachers  working  with  children  from  various \ndisadvantaged groups such as the disabled, ethnic tribes, and refugees. An awareness program will be developed for \nthe school management committee (SMC), parent and support groups, and NGOs to promote better understanding \nand support for teachers working with the poor and disadvantaged groups. \n \nProject activities such as distance education, the school cluster system, and new in-service teacher training programs, \nenhanced  preservice  training,  and  improved  incentives  to  teachers,  especially  the  allowance  for  rural  teachers,  are \nexpected to primarily benefit underserved and poor areas by providing better quality of teaching in secondary schools. \nWith  improved  teaching  quality,  secondary  school  students  from  poor  families  will  have  a  better  chance  to  acquire \nknowledge and skills for direct entry into the labor market or for pursuing further education. The consequences of this \nimprovement  will  have  an  impact  on  poverty  reduction  in  the  country,  as  experience  has  shown  that  improving  the \nhuman capital of the poor is highly successful in fighting poverty.   \n \n\nC.

To enhance community participation, SMCs require restructuring. Efforts will \nbe made to include in the SMCs local government representatives, especially female ones and representatives from \nthe parents and civil society or NGOs.

Capacity building and awareness raising programs will be developed for SMCs \nfor  recruitment  of  qualified  teachers,  and  better  management  and  quality  performance  of  schools.  Counseling  of \nstudents  and  counseling  meetings  between  students  and  teachers  will  be  initiated  in  the  schools  to  improve  the \nlearning  environment  and  to  promote  parents  participation  in  improving  the  performance  of  the  students  and  the \nschool.  Parent-teacher  associations  will  be  initiated  to  increase  community  involvement  in  improving  and  monitoring \nthe quality of teaching. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGirls'  enrollment  at  the  secondary  level  has  significantly  improved.  Gross  enrollment  rates  for  girls  are  higher than \nthose  for  boys  up  to  grade  10.  Much  of  the  improvement  can be attributed to the stipend programs, which support \nfemales with monthly stipends for educational expenses. But despite the positive trend in female secondary education, \ngirls' performance at the SSC examination is inferior to that of boys. In 2002, the total pass rate was 41%, and it was \n38%  for  girls .  The  performance  of  girls  in  school  and  retention  rate  are  influenced  by  several  factors:  (i)  distance  of \nschool and related safety and security; (ii) lack of female teachers in school; (iii) extra share of household duties for \ngirls than for boys and less time for girls to prepare for examinations; and (iv) male teachers' lack of understanding of \nadolescent girls, early marriage of girls, etc.     \n \nGovernment has a 30% quota for female teachers in secondary schools. A survey (1997), carried out by Program to \nMotivate,  Train  and  Employ  Female  Teachers  in  Rural  Secondary  Schools  (PROMOTE)  and  financed  by  the \nEuropean Commission, showed that women compromise only 5% of the teachers on the monthly payroll in secondary \nschools  in  rural  areas  and  20\u201330%  in  urban  areas.  In  the  remote  rural  areas,  50%  of  the  schools  have  never \nemployed a woman teacher. PROMOTE identified several factors preventing women from taking up employment as \nteachers: (i) social hindrance; (ii) tradition of male employment; (iii) lack of safe and decent accommodation; and       \n(iv) lack of school facilities suitable for women, e.g. lack of separate toilet facilities, and lack of separate sitting area.  \n\nThe  recruitment  practices  of  SMCs  also  hinder  women\u2019s  employment  in  teaching.  The  SMC  requires  the  potential \nteacher to make a donation to the school. Parents prefer to make donation for the employment of a son but not for a \ndaughter.  PROMOTE  addresses  these  issues  through  activities  that  include  campaign  and  advocacy,  provision  of \nfellowship for female teachers to participate in teacher training, and refurbishment of schools and hostels for women \nteachers.  The present membership structure of SMCs in secondary schools does not include female members. The \nmale-dominated  SMC  often  has  traditional  attitudes  toward  recruiting  female  teachers.  Since  PROMOTE  will  end  in \n2005, the Project will adopt and continue to implement strategies tested by PROMOTE to address issues regarding \nfemale teachers. In addition, the Project will the include following measures to improve the learning environment for \ngirls and to increase the number of female teachers in schools: \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n(ix)  \n\n(x)  \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nFurther  improve  the  curriculum  developed  by  the  SESIP  by  supporting  the  development  of \ncurriculum  material  for  teachers  in  counseling  for  adolescent  girls  and  boys;  behavioral  science; \ngender sensitization; social, economic, and cultural context of the learning atmosphere.  \nEstablish a process for parent-teacher counseling for adolescent girls and boys.  \nRestructure  the  SMCs  with  the  aim  of  including  at  least  40%  women  members.  The women \nmembers  will  comprise  mothers,  elected  women  representatives  of  the  local  government,  women \ncommunity leaders, and women teachers. \nSet up a gender sensitization program for SMCs as part of the campaign activities for recruitment of \nfemale teachers. \nIntroduce  an  enrollment  quota  for  women  teachers  in  training  programs  for  the  Bachelor  of \nEducation degree at the teacher training institutions under the Project. \nGive head teachers gender awareness training. \nRaise  the  recruitment  target  of  female  teacher  by  another  10%  (after  completion  of  PROMOTE; \nwhich targets to achieve 12% increase in the number of female teacher).  \nAssist schools to attain a 1:40 teacher-student ratio, to increase the demand for female teachers. \nFacilitate  SESIP\u2019s  program  to  appoint  qualified  women  as  head  examiners;  and  increase  women \nexaminers for the divisional board. \nMake  efforts  to  include  women  in  management  positions  in  the  project  management  unit  staff. \nInclude international and domestic consultants for social development and gender among those to \nbe engaged by the Project. \nThe social development and gender consultants should develop a plan of action, and a budget, to \naddress social and gender issues in implementing the Project.  \nInclude gender disaggregated data in the project management information system for monitoring.  \n\nContinued on next page \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.
