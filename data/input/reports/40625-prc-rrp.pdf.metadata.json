An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken. The summary environmental impact assessment was \ncirculated  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) and posted on the ADB website on 5 June 2009. \n \nThe  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  (the  Project) \nwill be ADB's first project to support bus rapid transit (BRT) in the \nPRC.  BRT  is  an  efficient  public  transport  system  that  provides \nmajor benefits for passengers and bus operators and reduces fuel \nconsumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  Project  is  part \nof  ADB's  initiative  to support greener,  more  sustainable  transport \nin  the  PRC  and  includes  support  for  an  application  to  use  the \nClean  Development  Mechanism  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  It  consists \nof  four  components  under  ADB  financing:  (i)  constructing  and \nreconstructing  33.8  kilometers  (km)  urban  roads,  including  bus \nrapid  transit  BRT  facilities  and  non-motorized  transport  (NMT) \nlanes; \ntraffic  management; \n(iii)  implementing an advanced environmental monitoring system; \nand  (iv)  building  capacity  to  support  project  implementation  and \nBRT operation and management.  \n \nLanzhou,  the  capital  of  Gansu  Province,  is  a  regional  hub \nbetween  the  eastern  and  western  regions  of  the  PRC.  Home  to \n3.1  million  inhabitants,  it  is  the  economic,  political,  and  cultural \ncenter  of  Gansu.  The  city  has  four  distinct  development  zones, \nthree  of  which  are  on  the  south  bank  of  the  Yellow  River,  where \nthe  business,  commerce,  and  government  centers  are  located. \nThe  fourth  zone  is  on  the  north  bank  of  the  river  at  Anning.  The \nLanzhou  municipal  government (LMG)  has  adopted  a  strategy  of \n\"one  river,  two  centers,  seven  groups\"  as  a  key  concept  of  its \nurban  master  plan  to  optimize  land  use  and  the  economic  and \nsocial functions of the city. It has decided to develop a second city \ncenter  in  Anning.  As  Anning  will  become  the  new  political, \nadministrative, economic, and cultural center of the city, there will \nbe  a  significant  increase  in  demand  for  transport  to,  from,  and \nwithin  Anning.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  realizing  the  urban \nmaster  plan  by  supporting  the  development  of  the  urban  road \nnetwork and the urban mass transport system serving the new city \ncenter.  It  will  focus  on  providing  a  sustainable  urban  transport \nsystem in Lanzhou. \n\nintroducing \n\nadvanced \n\n(ii) \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  sustainable  economic  growth, \neffective  environmental  improvement,  and  improved  quality  of \nurban  life  in  Anning.

The  Project  will  (i)  generate \ncertified emission reductions, (ii) increase average bus speeds on \nthe  BRT  corridor,  (iii)  increase  the  share  of  public  transport, \n(iv) shorten  the  average  travel  time,  and  (v)  lower  accident  rates \nfor vehicles and NMT. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $480.27 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $21.42 million. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n \nBank of China \nLanzhou Municipal Government \n  \n\n \n\nAmount    \n150.00 \n \n240.31 \n \n89.96 \n \n480.27 \n  \n\n % \n31.3 \n50.0 \n18.7 \n100.00 \n\n  \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $150  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate\u2013based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate\u2013based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nThe loan will be made to the PRC. The Government will make the \nloan  proceeds  available  to  the  Gansu  provincial  government \n(GPG)  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB \nloan,  with  GPG  bearing  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate \nvariation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  GPG  will  then  make  the  loan \nproceeds available to LMG on the same terms and conditions as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan,  with  LMG  bearing  the  foreign  exchange \nand interest rate variation risks of the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n \nLMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.

This  will  be  the  first  support  for  bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  in  the  PRC  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  BRT  is  an  efficient  public  transport  system  that  will  provide  major \nbenefits  for  passengers  and  bus  operators  and  will  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  greenhouse \ngas  (GHG)  emissions.  The  Project  is  part  of  ADB's  initiative  to  support  greener,  more \nsustainable  transport  in  the  PRC  and  includes  support  for  an  application  to  use  the  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  The  main  features  of  the  proposed \nProject are summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  PRC  has  experienced  significant  economic  progress.  Rapid  industrialization  and \n2. \nurbanization have seen the PRC economy grow very quickly, averaging more than 9% annually \nsince 1978 and over 10% annually from 2001 to 2008. Gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 \nwas  CNY30.07  trillion  ($4.40  trillion),  83  times  the  GDP  of  CNY362.4  billion  ($53.08  billion) \n3  decades earlier in 1978. Per capita GDP in 2008 was CNY22,698 ($3,324).  \n \n3. \nThe  development  of  transport  infrastructure,  including  expressways  and  other  road \nnetworks,  has  played  a  significant  role  in  enabling  sustained  economic  growth,  which  has \nsubstantially increased demand for transport. By the end of 2008, the PRC had a road network \nof  3.73  million  kilometers  (km),  including  60,300  km  of  expressways,  54,200  km  of  class  I \nhighways, 285,200 km of class II highways, 2.38 million km of class III and class IV highways, \nand 951,600 km of rural and other roads. By 2008, road transport accounted for 54.1% of total \npassenger-km travelled and 12.3% of freight traffic in ton-km, compared with 33.3% and 23.8% \nfor rail and 0.3% and 61.8% for waterways. \n \n4. \nWith  increases  in  per  capita  incomes,  as  well  as  reduced  customs  duties  on  vehicles \nfollowing  PRC  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  number  of  registered  vehicles \nincreased from about 1 million in the early 1990s to 43.58 million in 2008. Over the past 5 years, \nthe  number  of  registered  vehicles  has  increased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  16.3%.  Vehicle \nownership reached 33 vehicles per 1,000 people nationwide in 2008. It is expected to continue \nto  increase  rapidly,  considering  that  vehicle  ownership  per  1,000  people  is  generally  in  the \nrange of 300\u2013800 in industrialized countries. Vehicles bring enormous benefits to the economy \nand users by enhancing mobility. Rapidly growing demand, especially for private vehicles, is a \nmanifestation of the mobility benefits. However, associated with these benefits are the emerging \nproblems  of  traffic  congestion,  road  accidents,  air  pollution,  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions that cause widespread concern. \n \n5. \nUrban areas in the PRC have grown rapidly since the 1980s and now contribute 80% of \nGDP.  To  increase  personal  income  and  achieve  a  better  quality  of  life,  many  people  have \nmoved  from  the  countryside  to  the  cities.  Some  300\u2013400  million  people  migrated  in  a  single \ngeneration. The PRC\u2019s urban population accounted for 44.9% of the national population in 2007 \nand  is  expected  to  reach  47.0%  by  2010.  Rapid  economic  growth  and  rural\u2013urban  migration \nhave  changed the  structure  of urban transport. Suburban  areas  have  developed  around many \ncities for new residents. This has made it more difficult for people to rely on biking and walking \nand thereby increased the need for public transport. As vehicle ownership trends indicate, there \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nhas been a continuing shift toward using private vehicles for urban transport, but this trend is not \nsustainable because of the congestion it causes and the resulting deterioration in the quality of \nservice and efficiency of both private and public transport.  \n \nRapid motorization has allowed municipal governments little time to prepare strategically \n6. \neffective  responses  or  build  institutional  capacity  for  urban  transport.  They  have  responded  to \ndemand for more road space by investing heavily in road capacity and, in most cities, adopted \npiece-meal and stop-gap measures. The main solution to complex urban transport problems lies \nin  developing  efficient  and  affordable  public  transport  systems,  together  with  effective  pricing \nand  other  policies  to  manage  demand  for  private  vehicles.  It  is  becoming  clearer  to  the \nGovernment of the PRC (the Government) that increasing the capacity and efficiency of public \ntransport would contribute greatly to sustainable development. \n \n7. \nThe PRC has become the world\u2019s second-largest oil consumer, having gone from being \na net exporter of crude oil to importing a third of its fuel. The PRC contributed more than 40% of \nthe  increase  in  global  demand  for  primary  energy  between  2000  and  2006.  Despite  low \nemissions per capita, it became the world\u2019s largest national GHG emitter in 2006, and its GHG \nemissions are increasing rapidly as the economy continues to grow. Its total GHG emissions are \nprojected to rise by 65\u201380% over the 15 years from 2006 to 2020.  \n \n8. \nRoad transport is a significant and increasingly important contributor to PRC emissions \nof GHG. The transport sector currently accounts for 8% of energy consumption in the PRC, but \nthis  is  projected  to  increase  to  15%  by  2030.  Petroleum  consumption  was  10  million  tons  in \n2005,  with  vehicles  accounting  for  30%.  By  2020,  when  the  number  of  registered  vehicles  is \nprojected  to  reach  170  million,  petroleum  consumption  is  projected  to  reach  100  million  tons, \nwith vehicles accounting for 57%. Road GHG emissions are expected to increase by the same \nproportion. Burning 100 million tons of petroleum will emit 320 million tons of GHG. \n \nUnder  the  PRC\u2019s  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP,  2006\u20132010),  the  Government \n9. \nresource  optimization,  and \nregional  development, \nprioritizes \nenvironmental  protection \nimproved \ninvestment,  and \nincreased \ninfrastructure  management.  The  resource  optimization  targets  of  the  11FYP  in  the  transport \nsector  include  20%  reductions  in  (i)  land  utilization  per  100  million  vehicle-km,  (ii)  vehicle  and \nship energy consumption per ton-km, and (iii) emissions of major pollutants. Meeting the 11FYP \ntargets  requires  sustainable,  harmonious,  and  environmentally  friendly  development  in  the \ntransport sector.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\ninclusive  and  balanced \n\nthrough  policy \n\nreform, \n\nChallenges and Opportunities \n\n1. \n \n10. \nLanzhou,  the  capital  of  Gansu  Province,  is  a  regional  hub  between  the  eastern  and \nwestern  regions  of  the  PRC.  Home  to  3.1  million  inhabitants,  it  is  the  economic,  political,  and \ncultural center of Gansu. The population density of Lanzhou is 252 people per square kilometer \n(km2),  more  than  4  times  that  of  Gansu.  The  main  city  is  located  on  the  banks  of  the  Yellow \nRiver  and  contained  within  a  narrow  east\u2013west  valley  with  steep  terrain  at  both  the  north  and \nsouth  that  effectively  constrains  further  expansion  of  the  city.  The  urban  area  stretches  for \nalmost 40 km along the river from west to east but extends only 8 km from north to south and, at \nits narrowest point, is less than 1 km wide.  \n \nThe city has four distinct development zones. Three\u2014Xigu, Qilihe, and Chengguan\u2014are \n11. \nat the site of the original city on the south bank of the Yellow River and are still the centers of \nbusiness,  commerce,  and  government.  The  fourth  zone  is  on  the  north  bank  of  the  river  at \n\n\f3 \n\nAnning,  a  residential  area  that  is  also  a  center  for  education,  including  universities.  Economic \nactivity  and  population  are  heavily  concentrated  in  the  four  urban  districts,  which  occupy  only \n8.5%  of  Lanzhou\u2019s  land  area  but  account  for  62.9%  of  its  population  and  80.2%  of  its  gross \nregional product. There is limited potential for further growth of the city along the south bank. In \nChengguan,  in  particular,  population  density  has  reached  18,000/km2,  bringing  considerable \ncongestion and pollution. There is good potential for developing the city in Anning, where 80% \nof the land is suitable for settlement and the population density of only 3,400/km2. \n \nFuture urban development will therefore require a second city center to be developed at \n12. \nAnning.  To  realize  this  opportunity,  the  Lanzhou  municipal  government  (LMG)  has  adopted  a \nstrategy of \"one river, two centers, seven groups\" as the key concept of its urban master plan to \noptimize land use and the economic and social functions of the city. In support of this plan, the \nmunicipal  government  will  relocate  its  offices  from  Chengguan  district  to  the  new  center  in \nAnning. As Anning will become the new political, administrative, economic, and cultural center \nof the  city, there  will  be  a  significant  increase  in the  demand for  transport to, from,  and  within \nAnning. \n \n13. \nThe Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project will contribute to realizing the urban \nmaster  plan  by  supporting  the  development  of  the  urban  road  network  and  mass  transport \nsystem  serving  the  new  city  center.  The  component  roads  included  in  the  Project  have  been \nselected by LMG and proposed to ADB to provide improved access and connectivity between \nthe  business,  industrial,  and  education  centers  of  the  new  city  center  and  the  municipal \nadministrative district. \n \n \n \n14. \nIn  the  road  subsector,  the  World  Bank  (WB)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) have been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national and local road \nnetworks. The WB has provided loans of about $9.4 billion to finance road investments and the \nJICA (provided by Japan Bank for International Cooperation) has provided about \u00a5195.0 billion \nfor \nInvestment  Bank  (EIB)  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) provided cofinancing in the amount of Euro 85 million for road projects in \nthe  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  ADB  coordinates  with  these  development  partners  to \ndiscuss progress and issues in the sector. ADB has met regularly with the WB for coordination \nand  information  sharing.  The  Government  coordinates  the  activities  of  different  development \npartners  and  has  utilized  ADB  TA  support  for  researching  and  influencing  a  number  of  policy \ninterventions. ADB has coordinated closely with other development partners on policy dialogue \nand shared its development experiences with them. A summary of development coordination to \nthe road sector is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n15. \nThe Project will be ADB's first project to support urban mass transport in the PRC, though \nADB has previously provided technical assistance.1 During loan processing, the policy dialogue \non  sustainable  urban  transport  helped  LMG  to  refine  its  approach  to  transportation  in  the \nLanzhou City Urban Master Plan, notably by incorporating BRT, advanced traffic management, \ninformation technology, and an application to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the \nKyoto Protocol. The Project is part of ADB's initiative to support greener transport in the PRC.  \n\nthis  purpose.

China Urban Transport Symposium jointly sponsored with the PRC's Ministry of Finance, the Ministry \nof Construction, and the World Bank. Manila; and ADB. 1996. Beijing Urban Transport. Manila. The China Urban \nTransport Symposium emphasized the importance of supporting public transport and non-motorized transport and \ncontrolling the use of private cars in cities.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nPublic Transport \n\n16. \nFrom  2005  to  2020,  demand  for  public  transport  in  Lanzhou  is  expected  to  grow  by \n2.1 times, the number of registered passenger vehicles by 6.8 times, and the number of buses \nby 1.9 times. The forecasted traffic demand is higher in Anning than in other areas of Lanzhou \nbecause  of  the  development  of  the  new  city  center.  For  example,  traffic  demand  in  Anning  is \nexpected to grow by 2.8 times from 2008 to 2020 (Appendix 3).  \n \nImproved urban mass transport will play a critical role in the development of the new city \n17. \ncenter.  Recent  rapid  increases  in  passenger  vehicle  ownership  and  the  rapid  decline  of  non-\nmotorized  transport  (NMT)  are  causing  congestion  and  adverse  environmental  impacts  in \nLanzhou.  A  good-quality,  high-capacity  public  transport  system  is  needed  to  support  high-\ndensity  urban  development,  reduce  the  land  needed  for  transport,  and  enable  transit-oriented \ndevelopment.  Public  transport  generally  has  much  larger  passenger  carrying  capacity  than \nprivate vehicles, for much lower energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per passenger \ntrip. For example, the average CO2 emissions per person-km from a bus is 25 grams (g), only \none sixth the 150 g of a private vehicle. \n \n18. \nPublic transport helps avoid the vicious spiral of road investment accompanied by ever-\nincreasing  numbers  of  private  motor  vehicles  and  worsening  congestion.  BRT  offers  a  cost-\neffective, flexible, and environmentally friendly mass transit option for meeting the city's growing \ndemand for urban transport. BRT uses buses in segregated lanes to provide a higher quality of \npublic  transport  service  than  can  ordinary  buses  in  mixed  traffic  in  terms  of  passengers  per \nhour,  passenger  comfort,  station  quality,  operational  speed,  and  other  parameters.  BRT \nsystems  have  generally  been  well  received  by  users.  Following  policy  dialogue  during  project \nprocessing, LMG decided to introduce BRT on the main corridor in Anning. \n \n19. \nAs part of the PRC's macroeconomic stimulus package, LMG recently began preparing \nan initial project proposal for a Lanzhou light rail transit (LRT) system in March 2009. If built, the \nLRT  would  serve  other  parts  of  Lanzhou  and  complement  BRT  serving  Anning.  The  two \nsystems would be closely integrated to maximize service efficiency and convenience for users. \n \n\nb. \n\nClimate Change  \n\n20. \nThe international scientific community, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, has reached consensus that the earth is getting warmer. GHG emissions from human \nactivities  has  been  found  to  be  a  significant  contributor  to  this  change.  A  1\u00b0C  rise  in  average \nglobal temperatures  is  expected  to  have the following  consequences: (i)  water supplies for  50 \nmillion people will be threatened; (ii) 0.3 million deaths will occur from climate-related diseases, \nmalaria,  diarrhea,  and  malnutrition;  (iii)  at  least  10%  of  land  species  will  face  extinction;  and \n(iv)  Atlantic thermohaline circulation will start to weaken. Scientists warn that, depending on the \nglobal  GHG  emission  scenario,  the  world's  average  temperature  is  expected  to  rise  between \n1.8\u00b0C  and  4\u00b0C  by  the  end  of  this  century.  In  its  National  Climate  Change  Program,  the \nGovernment highlights particular sectors and areas in the country vulnerable to climate change. \nThese include, but are not limited to, agriculture and livestock, forest and natural ecosystems, \nwater  resources,  and  coastal  zones. In  addition,  it  anticipates  nationwide  impacts  such  as the \nspread of disease. \n \nTransport  accounts  for  14%  of  global  CO2  emissions.  CO2  emissions  are  expected  to \n21. \ngrow in tandem with energy consumption over the next 40 years. To help address the growth in \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nGHG  emissions  from  developing  countries,  the  Kyoto  Protocol  established  the  CDM,2 which \noffers further incentive for promoting low-carbon alternatives, including public transport projects, \nby selling certified emission reductions, or carbon credits, to developed countries. \n \n\nc. \n\nApplication of Information Technology \n\n22. \nIn many businesses and governments around the world, the construction and operation \nof  transportation  systems  is  being  transformed  by  computers,  sensors,  and  communications \ntechnology\u2014collectively  called  information  technology.  Information  technology  applied  to \nsurface transportation creates an intelligent transport system (ITS). An ITS provides the ability \nto  gather,  organize,  analyze,  use,  and  share  information  about  transportation  systems.  It  also \nprovides  vital  support  for  operating  transportation  systems,  including  traffic  management, \noversight of system maintenance, and more effectively and reliably managing public transport. \nThe support provided by an ITS helps increase the capacity of existing road infrastructure, the \nefficiency of road transport, and the quality of transport services. \n \n23. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  started  researching  and  developing  an  ITS  in  the  1990s  and \ndeveloped  the  ITS  strategic  program.  In  the  11FYP,  the  Government  stated  that  it  would \ncontinue  with  ITS  deployment  to  improve  transport  services,  infrastructure  management,  and \nnational  economic  development.  In  response  to  urban  transport  issues  and  the  emerging \ndemand for road transport, LMG wishes to increase the capacity and efficiency of road transport \nby utilizing an ITS.  \n \n24. \nInnovative  use  of  information  technology,  such  as  thorough  advanced  signal  systems, \nadvanced traveler information systems, and intelligent bus stop systems, can help increase the \ncapacity  of  infrastructure  in  Anning  by  managing  traffic  flow  and  mitigating  traffic  congestion, \nroad accidents, air pollution, urban poverty, and climate change.  \n\n \n\nd. \n\nNon-Motorized Transport  \n\n \n25. \nStrengthening  NMT  is  a sustainable  approach  to  urban transport.  Bicycles  and  walking \nminimize private vehicle traffic and advance the greening of urban transport. A socioeconomic \nsurvey conducted during project preparation indicated that, in Anning, walking constitutes 56% \nof person trips and bicycles 22%. However, by 2020 these rates are projected to decline to 44% \nand 16%, respectively, without the Project, as motor vehicles progressively dominate the roads \nand as trip distances grow in line with the city's expansion. The major issues for NMT are that \n(i)  many junction designs and roadway designs are not optimal for pedestrian and cyclist safety; \n(ii) a network of protected or separated bicycle lanes has not been developed and some NMT \nlanes have been captured by vehicles for driving and parking; and (iii) bicycle parking facilities \nat key locations such as bus stations, shopping centers, and public facilities are insufficient. \n \nDespite  rapid  growth  in  private  vehicle  ownership,  most  urban  households  are  without \n26. \nvehicles  and  likely  to  remain  so  for  the  next  10\u201315  years.  Their  mobility  needs  have  been \nunderserved  by  the  prevailing  emphasis  on  trying  to  accommodate  private  vehicle  use,  which \nerodes  the  convenience  and  safety  of  NMT.  There  are  conflicts  between  the  PRC's  objective \n\n                                                 \n2  The  CDM  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  aims  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  cost  effectively  by  financing  low-carbon \nprojects in developing countries, where costs may be lower than in industrialized countries. The CDM is supervised \nby  the  CDM  executive  board  (CDM  EB)  under  the  guidance  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate  Change.  Once  projects  are  registered  by  the  CDM  EB,  project  entities  can  implement  the  project  and \nmonitor  emission  reductions, which  must be  verified  and  certified  by a  third party.  Once  the  CDM  EB  issues  the \ncertified  emission  reductions  (CERs)  to  project  participants,  they  can  sell  them  to  receive  additional  revenue.  In \nsome cases, project entities can receive upfront payment for the future delivery of CERs. However, in these cases \nprices tend to be heavily discounted and bank guarantees may be sought to counter the risk of nondelivery. \n\n \n\n\fthat  all  families  will  eventually  have  access  to  a  private  vehicle,  the  associated  objective  of \nexpanding the urban road network, and the need to establish sustainable approaches to urban \ntransport. It is becoming clearer to LMG that road expansion alone does not adequately answer \nmotorization and traffic congestion and that, in addition to improving public transport, NMT has a \nrole to play in urban transport and making the city more livable. \n \n\ne. \n\nTraffic Demand Management (Demand-Side Policy) \n\n4. \n\nLesson Learned  \n\n \n27. \nIn  addition  to  supply-side  measures  such  as  the  provision  of  road  infrastructure, \ndemand-side  policy  measures  to  limit  the  use  of  private  vehicles  are  required  to  avoid  traffic \ncongestion  problems.  Many  large  cities  have  shown  that  supply-side  expansion  can  quickly \ncause severe traffic congestion when not accompanied by sufficient measures to make the use \nof  private  vehicles  relatively  less  attractive.  In  addition  to  restricting  private  vehicle  use, \ndemand-side  measures  such  as  traffic  demand  management  (TDM)  have  good  potential  to \ncreate an additional revenue stream to help finance public transport improvements. One of the \nsimplest approaches is to charge a relatively high fee for parking in city centers, thereby making \ncar  use  less  attractive  than  public  transport.  Singapore  and  London  are  among  the  cities  that \nhave  demonstrated  various  other  regulatory  and  demand-side  measures  to  limit  vehicle \nnumbers and reduce demand for vehicle use in congested city centers. \n \n \n \n28. \nUrban  transport  strategy  and  policy  need  to  combine  urban  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment  with  proactive  interventions  to  improve  public  transport  and  introduce  TDM.  The \ncombined  transport  strategy  and  policy  may  include  BRT  or  priority  public  transport  schemes, \nrestraints on car traffic in congested areas or at certain times of day, and congestion pricing for \nroad use. \n \n29. \nSeveral  BRT  systems  already  operating  in  the  PRC  have  a  number  of  weaknesses \nattributable to planning and design deficiencies. Lessons from these BRTs include the following: \nPhysical  design  should  take  into  account  operational  design  and  demand \ncharacteristics. \nBus  stations  should  not  be  located  near  intersections,  as  this  often  causes \nvehicles to block intersections and pedestrian crossings. \nStations  should  be  designed  to  meet  current  and  future  demand,  which  may \nrequire leaving space for future station expansion. \nStation  design  should  address  issues  of  peak  demand  to  avoid  long  queues  at \nticket windows. \nAs  stations  should  vary  in  size  depending  on  demand,  it  is  important  that  the \nBRT be designed by specialists with experience in BRT design. \nAs the goal of BRT is to save time and operational costs for all road users, BRT \ndesign and planning should proceed on this basis. \n\n(vi) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(vii)  Operational design should ensure that a large majority of bus passengers along \n\nthe BRT corridor are carried on BRT buses in the BRT system. \n\n(viii)  Specialized  high-capacity  BRT  vehicles  should  be  considered,  as  they  can \n\n(ix) \n\nimprove the quality of service and efficiency of energy use. \nOperation planning should be conducted to identify BRT station and operational \nrequirements and determine whether an operational subsidy is needed. \n\n(x)  Well  before  implementation,  a  BRT  agency  or  dedicated  team  should  be \nestablished  to  take  responsibility  for  project  implementation  and  the  initial \noperation of the system. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nADB has financed several transport and urban projects in Gansu.3 These projects have \n30. \nhelped  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Gansu  provincial  government  (GPG)  in  project \nimplementation. The GPG has transferred knowledge and experience to LMG to support project \npreparation and implementation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of the  Project  will  be  sustainable  economic growth,  effective  environmental \n31. \nimprovement,  poverty  reduction,  and  inclusive  social  development  in  Lanzhou  (Appendix  1). \nThe outcome will be an efficient, safe, and clean urban road transport system in Lanzhou. The \nProject will (i)  generate certified emission reductions, (ii) increase average bus speed along the \nBRT  corridor,  (iii)   increase  the  share  of  public  transport,  (iv)  shorten  average  travel  time,  and \n(v) decrease the accident rates of vehicles and NMT. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  providing  sustainable  urban  transport.  It  will  have  four \ncomponents  under  ADB financing  in  Lanzhou's Anning  and Qilihe  districts:  (i) the  construction \nand reconstruction of 33.8 km of urban roads including BRT facilities and NMT lanes (Appendix \n4);  (ii)   advanced  traffic  management;  (iii)  an  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system, \nincluding  air quality  sensors;  and (iv)  capacity  building. The  construction  and  reconstruction  of \nurban  roads  will  comprise  21.4  km  of  new  road  construction  and  12.4  km  of  reconstruction  of \nexisting  roads.  Some  13.0  km  of  BRT  lanes  and  22  BRT  stations  will  be  constructed  in  the \nmiddle  of  the  road  sections.  All  constructed  and  reconstructed  urban  roads  except  1.7  km  of \nS578 will have NMT lanes 3.5\u20135.0 meters wide between sidewalks and carriage ways, providing \ndedicated access for bicycles. The advanced traffic management component will comprise (i) an \nadvanced  traffic  control  system  (signal  control),  (ii)  TDM  strategy  and  policy  reform,  and  (iii)  a \nNMT  development  plan.  The  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system  will  consist  of \nmonitoring stations and a data-processing center that will monitor such air pollutants as nitrogen \ndioxide, sulfur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n33. \nThe  issue  of  the  sustainability  of  urban  transport  systems  is  receiving  increasing \nattention  as  a  matter  of  public  policy  at  all  levels  of  government  and  among  international \ndevelopment partners and nongovernment organizations. It is the core organizing concept of the \nProject.  A  sustainable  urban  transport  system  is  one  that  emphasizes  efficient  travel  patterns \nand  behavior  using  public  transport  and  NMT,  while  discouraging  inefficient  ones  such  as  the \nuse  of  private  vehicles.  Inefficient  travel  patterns  need  to  be  reduced  to  minimize  resource \nconsumption  and  environmental  effects.  The  special  features  of  the  Project  will  support \nsustainable  urban  transport  and  enhance  mobility,  health,  and  economic  development \nopportunities for local residents.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2004.

Manila (Loan 2407\u2013PRC). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nBus  Rapid  Transit.  By  introducing  BRT  in  Lanzhou,  the  Project  will  provide  a  cost-\n34. \neffective  and flexible  form  of mass  transport.  BRT  systems  typically  cost less  than  10%  of the \ncost  of  underground  metros  and  can  be  planned,  designed,  and  implemented  much  more \nquickly. Fares of underground metros are typically three to four times those of BRT. \n \n35. \nThe proposed BRT was designed after careful study of demand and BRT infrastructure \nand  operational  requirements  (Appendix  5).  BRT  will  be  constructed  mainly  in  the  new  city \ncenter in Anning, but the BRT corridor will cross the Yellow River and connect with the current \ncity center. To improve the quality of service, BRT will include an intelligent bus stop system at \nBRT stations that uses global positioning system units on buses and an associated information \nsystem on next bus arrival. The design of BRT stations will allow for future increases in capacity, \nand space for bicycle parking will be provided at all BRT stations to support NMT.  \n \n36. \nThere are two main types of BRT operating systems: (i) a closed system in which BRT \nbuses  operate  only  inside  the  BRT  corridor  and  (ii)  a  flexible  system  in  which  selected  BRT \nroutes  operate  both  inside  and  beyond  the  BRT  corridor,  making  allowance  for  both  existing \nbuses and specialized BRT buses. The proposed BRT will use the flexible system, whose main \nadvantages are (i) removing the need to build interchanges and transfer terminals, (ii) a greatly \nreduced the number of passenger transfers, and (iii) enabling the use of existing vehicles.  \n \nIf the proposed LRT is eventually built,4 the LRT and the BRT will be closely integrated. \n37. \nThe  BRT  will  serve  shorter-haul  passengers  in  the  vicinity  of  Anning,  while  the  LRT  serves \nlonger-haul passengers, mainly in other parts of Lanzhou.  \n \n38. \nGreenhouse  Gas  Emission  Reduction  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism. \nHigh demand for transport and associated traffic congestion make urban areas major sources of \nCO2 emissions in the PRC. Urban transport projects need to directly address the challenges of \nenergy  consumption  and  emissions.  BRT  will  improve  current  public  transport  systems  and \nreduce  the  energy  consumption  and  CO2  emissions  needed  to  meet  the  current  demand  for \npublic  transport  and  additional  demand  generated  as  passengers  are  diverted  from  private \nvehicles  and  by  future  economic  growth.  As  one  important  driving  force  of  the  Project,  GHG \nemission  reduction  has  been  considered  an  indicator  for  the  optimization  of  urban  transport \nsystem planning in Lanzhou. \n \n39. \nBRT  will  help  to  mitigate  climate  change  by  reducing  GHG  emissions  via  (i)  improved \nfuel-use  efficiency  through  the  use  of  new  and  larger  buses,  (ii)   mode  switching  with  the \navailability of an efficient and attractive public transport system, (iii) load increasing by having a \ncoordinated  system  for  dispatching  buses,  and  (iv)  buses\u2019  increased  average  speed.  The \nProject  is therefore  consistent  with  the  objective  of the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) and potentially eligible for gain carbon credits under the CDM. \nLMG  has  requested  ADB  support  in  preparing  its  application  to  the  CDM  for  the  BRT \ncomponent  of  the  Project. 5  Preparing  a  CDM  application  can  be  complex  and  requires \nsubstantial data and documentation. Globally, only one BRT system has so far been registered \nfor the CDM. ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative will provide integrated technical support to LMG for \nthe  CDM  application,  as  outlined  in  Appendix  6.  The  Project  will  also  support  building  the \ncapacity  of  LMG  in  resource  optimization  in  the  transport  sector  to  enhance  the  city\u2019s  energy \nefficiency and help it maintain a small carbon footprint. \n \n                                                 \n4  Although Lanzhou does not qualify under the minimum national standards for constructing an LRT line, LMG began \npreparing an initial project proposal for an LRT system in March 2009. Very high cost makes it uncertain that the \nLRT proposal will be approved.  \n\n5  As part of project preparation, ADB arranged a  workshop on climate change and the CDM in Lanzhou on 15\u201316 \n\nNovember 2008.  \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nIf  approved  for  the  CDM,  the  BRT  component  of  the  Project  will  generate  about  5,000 \n40. \ncertified  reductions 6  of  GHG  emissions  annually.  The  prices  for  these  carbon  credits  vary \ndepending on market conditions, but at $10 per credit, for example, the Project could generate \nadditional revenue of $50,000 per year. Carbon credits may provide LMG with additional income \nto  contribute  to  the  cost  of  maintaining  and  operating  BRT.  While  the  current  CDM  under  the \nKyoto Protocol will terminate by 2012, a post-2012 CDM-like framework has been discussed at \nthe  Conference  of  the  Parties  and  Meeting  of  the  Parties  of  the  UNFCCC,  though  a  final \narrangement has yet to be decided. Existing and potential voluntary markets for CO2 reductions \ncould  help  sustain  the  development  of  GHG-mitigating  projects.  The  Future  Carbon  Fund,  an \nintegral part of ADB's Carbon Market Initiative, seeks to further stimulate investments in GHG-\nmitigating  projects  by  enabling  project  developers  to  gain  benefits  beyond  2012.  ADB  is  the \ntrustee of the Future Carbon Fund. Any investments by the Future Carbon Fund are subject to \napproval  by  the  Fund  Board,  which  consists  of  public  and  private  sector  participants.  The \nProject will support finding an opportunity to utilize the Future Carbon Fund. \n \n41. \nAdvanced  Traffic  Control  System  (Signal  Control).  The  Project  will  introduce \nadvanced  technology  to  replace  obsolete  signal  equipment  and  significantly  expand  the \ngeographic coverage of active traffic control on new and reconstructed roads. This will support \nvideo and other monitoring systems for stoplight violations, traffic lane adherence, license plate \nidentification,  speed  detection,  and  variable  message  signing.  The  data  collected  by  the \nadvanced  traffic  control  system  will  be  shared  for  road  maintenance,  road  and  transport \nplanning, and environmental and CDM monitoring. \n \n42. \nTraffic  Demand  Management  Strategy  and  Policy  Reform.  TDM  addresses  traffic \ncongestion  by  reducing  or  optimizing  demand  for  transport  and  influencing  user  behavior  at \nvarious  levels.  The  Project  will  streamline  TDM  concepts  and  strategy  in  Lanzhou  and \n(i) develop a TDM strategy including recommendations, action plans, and guidelines, which will \nenable  LMG  to  build  capacity  for  implementing  TDM  and  incorporate  TDM  concepts  and \nstrategy into future city planning; (ii) reform on a pilot basis the current policy on pricing public \nparking by introducing a demand-based pricing system; (iii) develop the concept of pilot traffic-\ncalming  zones  to  restrict  high-speed  driving,  through  traffic,  and  truck  traffic  with  traffic \nregulations and physical barriers; and (iv) advise on the institutional coordination of TDM issues \nwithin LMG (Appendix 7). \n \n43. \nNon-Motorized  Transport  Development  Plan.  Another  important  requirement  for \nAnning\u2019s  becoming  a  sustainable  and  livable  city  center  is  to  provide  for  NMT  with  bicycle \nroutes, pedestrian sidewalks, and crossings. NMT is an essential element of sustainable urban \ntransport. The Project will incorporate the provision of 32.1 km of NMT lanes and bicycle parking \nfacilities  in  the  new  city  center.  It  will  support  the  creation  of  a  NMT  development  plan  for \nLanzhou,  including  an  NMT  development  framework  and  recommendations.  The  NMT \ndevelopment  framework  will  prepare  (i)  a  financing  framework  for  NMT  interventions,  (ii) the \nintroduction  of  transit-oriented  development,  (iii)  an  incentive  scheme  for  shopkeepers  and \nemployers  to  support  NMT,  (iv)  engineering  normative  designs  for  road  networks,  and \n(v)   campaigns  to  promote  NMT  safety.  The  recommendations  to  be  developed  will  support \nimproved  NMT  design,  improved  NMT  network  and  connectivity  to  other  transport  modes,  the \nenforcement of traffic regulation for the effective use of NMT lanes, and a reduction in accidents \ninvolving pedestrians and cyclists (Appendix 7). \n \n\n                                                 \n6  The volume of certified emission  reductions  (CERs)  has been only preliminarily  estimated  for  lack of data  and  is \nsubject to change. The CDM project design document, the application document for the CDM that contains the final \nCER calculation, is expected to be completed in early 2010, after obtaining results from the baseline survey as well \nas the detailed design of the proposed BRT system. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n44. \nduties of $21.42 million (Table 1). \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  investment cost  of the  Project  is  estimated at  $480.27  million,  including taxes  and \n\n45. \nThe Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreement.  The  Borrower  has \ninformed  ADB  that  interest  during  implementation  and  commitment  charges  will  be  paid  by \nLMG.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate\u2013based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB at loan negotiation.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The  domestic  Bank  of  China  will  finance  $240.31  million,  or \n50.0% of the project cost. LMG will finance the remaining cost of $89.96 million, or 18.7% of the \nproject  cost.  LMG  has  provided  a  commitment  letter  to  confirm  (i) the  timely  provision  of \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nadequate counterpart funds and (ii) the provision of additional counterpart funding to cover any \nfunding  shortfalls  that  may  occur  during  project  implementation.  The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2.

The Government will make the loan proceeds \navailable  to  GPG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan,  with  GPG \nbearing  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  GPG  will  then \nmake  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  LMG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the \nADB loan, with LMG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks of the ADB \nloan. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\nLMG  will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. LMG has established a project \n48. \nsteering  committee  (PSC).7 The  deputy  mayor  of  Lanzhou  will  chair  PSC  meetings  every  3 \nmonths, or more often if necessary, to review implementation, resolve coordination issues, and \nprovide  guidance  for  the  timely  completion  of  the  Project.  LMG  has  established  and  staffed  a \nproject  management  office  (PMO).  The  PMO  will  coordinate  (i)  project  management; \n(ii)   supervise  the  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  under  the  Project; 8 \n(iii)   monitor  the  utilization  of  the  ADB  loan,  domestic  bank  funding;  and  (iv)  Government \nfunding; and prepare and review the reports to be submitted to ADB and the Government. LMG \nhas  appointed  a  project  manager  for  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation \n(Appendix 9). \n \n49. \nAfter  project  completion,  project facilities  will  be transferred  to the  relevant government \nentities  for  operation  and  management:  roads,  bridges,  and  utilities  to  the  Anning  and  Qilihe \ndistrict  urban  infrastructure  management  stations;  the  advanced  traffic  control  system  to  the \nLanzhou Municipal Traffic Police Brigade; BRT stations and ticketing machines to the Lanzhou \nPublic  Transport  Group  (LPTG);  platforms  of  the  BRT  stations  and  BRT  lanes  to  the  Anning \ndistrict urban infrastructure management station; street lights to the street lightning management \nsection; and the advanced environmental monitoring system to the Anning district environmental \nprotection bureau.  \n \n\n                                                 \n7  The  PSC  consists  of  representatives  from  the  city  agencies  with  responsibility  for  implementing  the  Project, \nincluding  the  Lanzhou  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Lanzhou  Municipal  Financial  Bureau,  Lanzhou \nMunicipal  Planning  Bureau,  Lanzhou  Municipal  Construction  Commission,  Lanzhou  Municipal  Land  Resources \nBureau, Lanzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Lanzhou Municipal Traffic Police Brigade, Lanzhou Municipal \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau,  Lanzhou  Public  Transport  Group,  Lanzhou  Urban  Investment  Company, \nLanzhou Municipal Economic and Technical Zone, and Lanzhou Municipal Foreign Loan Utilization Office, which \nwas established under the Lanzhou Development and Reform Committee. \n\n8  Under the supervision of the Gansu Bidding Office. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n50. \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  2009  to  2014.  The  implementation \n\n51. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $1.0  million  or  more  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  at \n$10.0 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $200,000  or  more  but  less  than  the  above-mentioned  ICB \nvalue,  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  at  $200,000  or  more  but  less  than  the  above-\nmentioned  ICB  value,  will  be  procured  by  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999),  subject  to  modifications  agreed \nwith ADB. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n52. \nADB  will  finance  22  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  65  person-\nmonths  of  national  for  (i)  reforming  TDM  strategy  and  policy,  (ii)  planning  BRT  operation  and \nmanagement,  (iii)  planning  NMT  development,  (iv)  reviewing  BRT  detailed  design,  and \n(v) building capacity for BRT operation and management. The consultants to be financed under \nthe ADB loan will be selected and engaged based on a simplified technical proposal using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method9 and using the individual consultant selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The Government will engage and finance international consultants (10 person-months) \nand  national  consultants  (2,493  person-months)  for  detailed  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision, environmental supervision and monitoring, resettlement monitoring and evaluation, \nproject  performance  monitoring,  studies,  and  capacity  building.  The  international  and  national \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvanced Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n53. \nLMG requested ADB's approval of advanced contracting for three civil works packages \ncovering  four  road  sections  and  for  international  and  national  consulting  services  for  the \nsupervision of the detailed design of the BRT system, including overseas and domestic training. \nThe request will significantly expedite project implementation, enable the timely commencement \nof  civil  works,  and  ensure  appropriate  BRT  design.  Advanced  contracting  for  civil  works  and \ninternational  and  national  consulting  services  for  reviewing  the  BRT  detailed  design  was \napproved  on  4  June  2009.  This  will  include  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  posting  the  consultant \nrecruitment notice, short-listing, and requesting and evaluating proposals. Advanced contracting \nwill  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants.  Retroactive  financing  will  not  exceed  20%  of  the  total  ADB  loan,  or  $30 \nmillion  for  eligible  expenditures,  including  three  civil  works  contract  packages  for  four  road \nsections, international and national consulting services, and overseas and domestic training that \nwill be directly administered by LMG. Costs for retroactive financing should be incurred before \nloan  effectiveness  but  not  more  than  12  months  before  the  Loan  Agreement  is  signed.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  does  not  commit  ADB to finance the Project. It  was  agreed  that  national competitive \n\n                                                 \n9  The quality:cost ratio is 80:20. \n\n \n\n\fbidding procedures will be used for procuring civil works for the three contract packages under \nretroactive financing.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n54. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  GPG,  and  LMG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n55. \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payments  and  commitment  procedures  will  be \nused  for  large  contracts.  If  Government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s \nreimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To  facilitate  disbursements,  the  Gansu  Provincial \nFinance  Department  will  establish,  after  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  with  a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account ceiling will not exceed the estimated \nexpenditure to be financed from the imprest account for the next 6 months or 10% of the ADB \nloan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite the flow of funds, the statement of expenditures \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse,  liquidate,  or  replenish  eligible  expenditures  for  any \nindividual payment not exceeding $200,000 equivalent. The financial management assessment \nfound the PMO to have the capacity to administer arrangements to disburse project finances.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  semiannual  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress  made, \n(ii) problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected in the \nnext  6  months.  LMG  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such  accounts \nand related financial statements audited annually by an independent auditor and in accordance \nwith auditing standards that are acceptable to ADB. LMG is required to submit to ADB within 6 \nmonths  after the  end  of each fiscal  year  certified  copies  of  such  audited project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements and auditor's reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  a  separate  opinion  on  the \nuse of imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedure, and (iii) an assessment of \ncompliance with loan covenants that may be agreed under the Project and ADB's requirements \non project management. An internal audit unit has been established in LMG to ensure that an \neffective internal control system and a mechanism of checks and balances are put in place. The \nunit  will  independently  test  PMO  financial  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  project-\nfinanced  assets  and  report  directly  to  LMG  and  external  auditors.  The  PMO  will  make \nsatisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of the project implementation by submitting \nto ADB quarterly progress reports and, within 3 months of the end of the Project, a completion \nreport. \n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe  PMO  has  concurred  with  the  proposed  set  of  monitoring  indicators  for  the  project \nperformance monitoring system  in  the  Project\u2019s design  and monitoring framework. The  design \nand monitoring framework includes key indicators that relate to project impacts, outcomes, and \noutputs.  The  PMO  will  hire  qualified  national  consultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project \nperformance, establishing the monitoring and evaluation system, and training staff of the PMO \nin  its  use.  The  consultants  will  measure  the  indicators  and  report  their  findings  to  ADB  upon \nproject  inception,  midterm,  completion,  and,  compared  with  the  baseline,  annually  for  3  years \nafter  completion.  About  11  person-months  of  national  consultants'  services  are  required  to \nconduct field surveys, collect and analyze the data, and prepare reports. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nADB  will  carry  out  review  missions  during  project  implementation.  After  the  Project  is \ndeclared  effective,  an  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  to  finalize  the  project  administration \nmemorandum and secure ADB and Government agreement on it. In the project administration \nmemorandum,  detailed  procedures  for  project  implementation  will  be  described,  including \nexplanations  of major  covenants,  procurement,  disbursement, reporting, and  safeguards.  ADB \nwill  carry  out  annual  review  missions  to  confirm  project  implementation  status  and  discuss  all \nproject-related  issues  with  LMG.  A  midterm  review  mission  will  be  fielded  in  the  3rd  year  of \nproject implementation, through which ADB will carry out a comprehensive review of the status \nof project implementation. The cost estimate, the project\u2019s economic viability, and resettlement \nprogress  will  be  reviewed.  If  issues  are  identified  during  review  missions,  adequate  corrective \nmeasures will be taken to ensure successful project implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Operational Aspects \n\n59. \nFinancial  Aspects.  As  the  Project  is  not  revenue  earning,  no  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  can  be  calculated.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  was  evaluated  as  follows. \nAnnual  maintenance  will  be  required  to  maintain  the  project  roads,  with  periodic  maintenance \nevery 7 years. For the entire project road, the average annual cost of maintenance is anticipated \nto  be  $2.8  million,  with  $56.97  million  for  periodic  maintenance  every  7  years.  The  average \nannual cost of maintaining BRT facilities and other traffic-management equipment is anticipated \nto be $0.6 million. Through its Urban Infrastructure Management Division, LMG will provide the \nnecessary funds for maintaining project assets (Appendix 12). \n \n60. \nOperational Aspects. BRT services will be provided by LPTG, which is wholly owned by \nLMG.  LPTG  operates  extensive,  reliable  public  transport  services  in  Lanzhou.  It  possesses \n2,089  buses  and  operates  92  bus  routes  with  a  total  route  length  of  1,076  km.  All  buses  in \nLanzhou  have  been  converted  from  diesel  to  compressed  natural  gas,  which  is  more \nenvironmentally friendly. Compressed natural gas buses will be used in the BRT lanes. In 2000, \nLPTG  started  implementing  a  prepaid  system  with  integrated  circuit  cards  on  selected  routes. \nToday,  all  routes  and  buses  are  equipped  with  the  integrated  circuit  card  system.  Some  1.5 \nmillion integrated circuit cards are currently issued, and 55% of bus fares are paid using them. \n \n61. \nLPTG's  average  annual bus  ridership  increased by  11.7% from  2004  to 2008.  Average \nannual  revenue  per  bus  increased  from  CNY132,650  in  2004  to  CNY210,950  in  2008  (for  an \nannual  increase  of  12.3%);  average  revenue  per  passenger  increased  from  CNY0.76  to \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nCNY0.81  (1.6%  annually);  and  average  annual  passenger  trips  per  employee  increased  from \n48,030 to 70,710 in 2008 (10.2% annually).  \n \n62. \nThe LPTG bus division consistently shows a net operating profit, ranging from CNY56.75 \nmillion  in  2004  (22.3%  of  revenue)  to  CNY63.26  million  in  2008  (15%  of  revenue).  When \nadministrative  overhead  and  other  non-operating  expenses  are  included,  the  bus  division\u2019s \nprofitability has had mixed results, with 2004, 2005, and 2008 showing a net loss before tax and \n2006  and  2007  showing  a  profit.  With  the  commencement  of  BRT  services  in  2013,  the  bus \ndivision\u2019s profit before tax is projected to increase to CNY85.1 million. There will be no need for \nLMG to subsidize LPTG bus operators, including those operating BRT, in view of their expected \nprofitability (Appendix 16). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n63. \nThe  traffic  forecast  was  prepared  by  Lanzhou  Jiaotong  University  using  a  conventional \nfour-stage  transport  model  with  a  12x12  zone  origin\u2013destination  trip  matrix.  The  university \nconducted the origin\u2013destination survey in 2001 to support the comprehensive Lanzhou Transport \nPlan. Transport planning software called TRANSCARD was used in the traffic demand analysis \nto  simulate  traffic  flows  in  the  base  year,  2008,  and  for  projections  for  2013,  2015,  2020,  and \n2025. Updated traffic data for the base year was obtained from traffic counts conducted in 2008. \nTraffic accident statistics and bus operation surveys were used in the analysis.  \n \n64. \nThe  economic  analysis  compared  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  and  \u201cwith  project\u201d  scenarios.  The \ncosts  included  capital  costs  for  physical  networks  and  BRT  works,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, environmental control and monitoring, detailed engineering design, implementation \nsupervision,  and  physical  contingencies.  Annualized  recurring  costs  for  road  maintenance, \nenvironmental  monitoring,  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  land  were  included  in  the  analysis.  The \nquantified network benefits included time savings for passengers and freight, vehicle operating \ncosts, and reduced traffic accidents and vehicle emissions. The economic internal rate of return \nunder  the  most  likely  traffic  growth  scenario  is  17.02%  with  a  net  present  value  of  CNY1.65 \nbillion  using  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  Sensitivity  tests  were  performed  to  examine  the  effect  of \nalternative traffic growth  rates,  likely  cost  overruns,  likely  benefit  reductions,  and  combinations \nof contingencies. The test results indicate that project economic viability is robust. Moreover, the \nreview of benefit distribution among different income groups shows that public transport users, \npedestrians, and bicyclists will be the prime beneficiaries of the Project (Appendix 13). \n \nC. \n \n65. \nThe  population  of  Anning  district  in  2007  was  225,859,  of  which  199,528  (88%)  was \nurban. The GDP per capita of Anning is lower than the average for Lanzhou because it was not \na  key  urban  development  zone  until  very  recently.  The  urban  poverty  rate  in  Anning  district  is \n5.5%,10 and  the  official  rural  poverty  rate  is  2.8%.11 Less  than  5%  of  people  in  Anning  own \nvehicles, and most rely on walking, bicycles, or buses. The project area has very few members \nof  ethnic  minorities,  and  they  will  not  be  significantly  affected  by  the  Project  or  its  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  category  C  under  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n66. \nThe  social  and  poverty  analysis  concluded  that  the  Project  will  be  very  beneficial  to \nmany  stakeholders.  Although  the  poverty  rate  in  Anning  is  quite  low,  there  are  vulnerable \n\nSocial Aspects  \n\n                                                 \n10 Based on average monthly income below CNY230 per capita. \n11 Based on average annual net income below CNY1,000 per capita. Using the international poverty line of $1.25 per \n\nday, the incidence of rural poverty in Anning would be about 10%. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nResettlement  \n\ngroups such as the disabled and elderly that have special needs for transport. The Project will \naddress transport and related social issues (e.g., accessibility, safety, and affordability) through \nthe  improved  design  of  transport  infrastructure,  operations,  and  services.  Project  design  will \nemphasize  improvements  for  pedestrians,  bicycles,  and  bus  transport,  including  BRT  (e.g., \nsafer  pedestrian  crossings,  speed  controls,  better  NMT  routes,  and  improved  bus  services). \nOther  social  measures  will  enhance  benefits  for  local  people,  including  farmers,  women,  the \nelderly, the disabled, and children. A social development action and monitoring plan (SDAMP) \nhas been formulated in consultation with key stakeholders and will be implemented by the PMO \nand  other  relevant  agencies.  Actions  and  monitoring  measures  that  will  target  and/or  involve \nwomen in their design and implementation have been included in the SDAMP (e.g., traffic safety \nawareness, livelihood training, pedestrian training, and adequate lighting on streets and at bus \nstops).  The  implementation  of  these  actions  will  ensure  that  (i)  development  benefits  are \ninclusive  of  women;  children;  and  the  elderly,  disabled,  and  poor  and  that  (ii)  any  adverse \nimpacts are identified and avoided or mitigated (Appendix 14). \n \n67. \nThere  was  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation  throughout  project \ndesign.  Household  surveys  and  group  discussions  were  conducted  for  people  affected  by \nresettlement, residents of the project area, and transportation users. Consultations were carried \nout  with  relevant  local  government  agencies,  All  China  Women\u2019s  Federation,  and  Disabled \nPeople\u2019s Federation. Consultation will continue, and participation will be encouraged during the \nfinalization  of  project  design;  the  implementation  of  project  components;  and  resettlement, \nenvironment, and other social measures. Local communities will help monitor the SDAMP.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  significant  resettlement,  as  122  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be \n68. \nacquired,  including  49  ha  of farmland,  affecting 780   households.  Also, 1,409  houses  and  288 \nbusinesses  will  be  demolished  and  relocated.  The  Project  will  adversely  affect  8,000  people, \nnearly all of whom are rural residents or have recently registered for urban residence. As Anning \nis an urban district of Lanzhou, compensation standards for land acquisition and the relocation \npolicy  for  rural  residents  there  are  very  reasonable  and  have  gained  the  support  of  affected \nhouseholds.  Some  efforts  have  been  made  to  minimize  land  acquisition  by  considering \nalternative  road  designs,  but  the  area  has  already  been  zoned  for  redevelopment  so  villagers \nwill eventually be relocated. The focus of resettlement planning has therefore been to integrate \naffected people into the new city development zone, where they will benefit from improved living \nconditions  and  higher  property  values.  Most  people  will  select  exchange  housing  in  four \nresettlement  sites  that  will  be  constructed  by  the  Anning  district  government.  These  sites  will \nserve other future resettlement needs, as Anning continues implementing its urban master plan, \nwhich  will  ensure  better-quality  housing,  public  facilities,  social  amenities,  and  commercial \nopportunities.  The  impact  on  income  is  not  significant  for  most  affected  households  because \n(i)  the land lost is relatively small for the road sections and (ii) most of their income is already \nderived  off  the  farm.  Nonetheless,  some  seriously  affected  households  and  vulnerable  people \nwill  receive  training,  employment  arrangements,  and/or  other  assistance  to  ensure  their \nlivelihoods  are  improved  and  sustainable.  The  resettlement  cost  is  $152.08  million.  The \nresettlement  plan  and  other  information  have  been  disclosed  to  affected  villages  and \nhouseholds. Land acquisition and resettlement cost will be financed by borrowing from the Bank \nof China and by LMG's own funds (Appendix 15).  \n \nE. \n \n69. \nADB  has  classified the Project  as  environmental  category  A. The environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) by the Gansu Environmental Science and Design \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nRisks \n\nResearch  Institute  and,  in  February  2009,  approved  by  the  Lanzhou  Environmental  Protection \nBureau. ADB has reviewed, through its environment committee, the EIA and its summary, which \nwas circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on its website on 5 June 2009. The EIA \nassessed  the  environmental  impacts  of  Project  components  and  prescribed  environmental \nprotection  and  mitigation  measures.  To  ensure  that  all  potentially  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  of  the  Project  are  mitigated,  the  PMO  will  implement  an  environmental  management \nplan, whose measures will be incorporated into bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nF. \n \n70. \nThe  following  risks  could  affect  the  timely  implementation  or  economic  viability  of  the \nProject, or the realization of its benefits: (i) inadequately designed BRT that fails to improve the \nefficiency  of  public  transport  or  attract  people  to  use  it  to  the  extent  projected,  (ii)  lacking \ncapacity  for  BRT  operation  and  management,  (iii)  lacking  cooperation  for  BRT  from  bus \noperators  and  other  authorities,  (iv)  BRT  ridership  taken  by  LRT,  (v)  delay  in  the  provision  of \ncounterpart  funding,  and  (vi)  failure  to  provide  adequate  assistance  to  people  affected  by \ninvoluntary resettlement. Risks will be mitigated through the (i) provision of consulting services \nto supervise BRT design; (ii) provision to LMG and the PMO of institutional capacity building for \nBRT operation and management planning; (iii) development of manuals for BRT operation and \nmanagement  and  implementation  of  training;  (iv)  well-coordinated  design  and  development  of \nfunding;  and \nthe  LRT;  (v)  covenanted  assurances  on \n(vi)  management of resettlement to include (a) favorable compensation, relocation, and social \nsecurity  policies  of  LMG;  (b)  livelihood  training;  (c)  semiannual  resettlement  implementation \nmonitoring; and (d)  strengthening of internal monitoring and supervision. \n \n\nthe  provision  of  counterpart \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  GPG,  LMG,  and  PMO  have \n\n71. \ngiven the following key specific assurances:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nConstruction  quality.

Walking  and  biking  accounted  for  73.8%  of  trips  up  to  5  km,  and  public \ntransport  dominates  longer  trips  (90%  buses  and  4%  taxis).  Estimates  suggest  that  walking \naccounts for more than 50% of personal trips, bicycles 20%, buses 22%, and personal vehicles \nand  taxis  around  3%  each.  There  were  247,000  vehicles  in  circulation  in  the  city  in  2007, \nincluding  6,700  taxis  and  2,350  buses.  Motorization  is  fast,  with  30,000  new  vehicles  in  2007 \nand growth of 12% per annum over the last 10 years, two thirds of which is personal vehicles \n(growing by 20% per annum). \n \n\nFigure A3: Motor Vehicles in Lanzhou City \n\n14.2%\n\n13.5%\n\n11.4%\n\n11.5%\n\n247,451\n\n12.0%\n\n10.3%\n\n10.2%\n\n8.8%\n\n217,965\n\n190,924\n\n171,185\n\n153,715\n\n100,000\n\n116,115\n\n139,443\n\n128,121\n\ns\ne\nl\nc\ni\nh\ne\nv\n \nd\ne\nr\ne\nt\ns\ni\ng\ne\nR\n\n300,000\n\n250,000\n\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n50,000\n\n0\n\n16.0%\n\n14.0%\n\n10.0%\n\n8.0%\n\n6.0%\n\n4.0%\n\n2.0%\n\n0.0%\n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\nt\ns\ni\ng\ne\nr\n \nn\n\ni\n \ne\ns\na\ne\nr\nc\nn\n\ni\n \nl\na\nu\nn\nn\nA\n\n \n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n% Increase\n\nTotal Number of motor vehicles (End of Year)\n\n                      Source: Lanzhou City Traffic Police Brigade. \n \n \n2. \nRoad  Traffic.  The  road  system  comprises  1,136  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  including \n360.5 km in urban areas categorized as trunk, secondary, or branch (Table A3.1). Primary trunk \nroads do not have clear division of function; they operate with a combination of interrupted traffic \nwhere  there  are  several  traffic  signals  and  uninterrupted  traffic  in  areas  with  grade-separated \ninterchanges.  Public transport  is  concentrated  along  a few  corridors,  and  not  enough  space  is \nprovided for bus stops, resulting in long lines of buses in the bus lanes. Mixed traffic, inadequate \nroad land-use policies, and poor enforcement of parking regulations contribute to a great deal of \non-road friction. An inadequate road structure has caused traffic congestion in the city center. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Composition of Classified Urban Road Network \n\nLength (km) \n\nRoad Class \nExpressway \nTrunk Road \nSecondary Road \nBranch Road \nTotal \n \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Lanzhou Public Traffic Special Plan (2007). \n\n0.0 \n73.3 \n103.7 \n183.5 \n360.5 \n\nPercentage \n\n0.0 \n20.3 \n28.8 \n50.9 \n100.0 \n\n \nTraffic  signal  control  systems  are  an  area  where  the  city  has  made  progress  and \n3. \nbenefits  from  a  good  institutional  capacity.  The  Lanzhou  Public  Security  Bureau  Traffic  Police \nBrigade  has  responsibility \nfor  system  development,  operating  regulations,  and  policy \nenforcement.  Lanzhou  has  an  extensive  system  of  traffic  signal  controls  in  all  urban  districts, \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nand  particularly  in  Chengguan  and  Qilihe,  the  most  densely  populated.  They  are  managed \nremotely and built around the most advanced optimization technology. However, Anning district \nlags  behind,  as  only  20  intersections  are  controlled  with  signals,  installations  use  older  and \nsimpler  technology,  and  roughly  half  are  primarily  used  on  a  yellow  flash  cycle  due  to  their \nlimited capability. The development of Anning will require upgrading the on-road equipment on \nthe  newly  constructed  or  rehabilitated  roads.  Further,  the  Lanzhou  Public  Security  Bureau \nTraffic Police Brigade has assessed that introducing an intelligent transport system could bring \nsubstantial  efficiency  gains  by  reducing  road  congestion  and  improving  enforcement.  A  future \ntraffic  signal  control  system  will  integrate  the  various  on-road  control  systems  and  bring  road \noperation in line with good practice. \n \n4. \nPublic Transport. Public transport in Lanzhou is undertaken in taxis and buses. Trolley \nbuses were discontinued in 2008, and the rail lines crossing the city are used mainly by intercity \npassenger and freight transport. The Lanzhou Public Transport Group (LPTG) is responsible for \noperating  public  buses.  LPTG  possesses  2,089  buses  in  2009  and  operates  on  92  routes. \nThere are about 99 minibuses in 2009, which individual operators run with no fixed bus stops. \nThe Lanzhou municipal government has bought up the individual bus companies to consolidate \nthem into LPTG. Bus running speed is high on average at 16.7 kilometers (km) per hour. The \nnumber of buses, at 1.15 per 1,000 people, appears adequate. Technology-oriented innovations \nhave  contributed  to  improved  operational  and  environmental  efficiency.  In  2000,  LPTG  started \nimplementing the integrated circuit card system on selected routes. Today all routes and buses \nare equipped with the system. LPTG converted the bus fleet from diesel to compressed natural \ngas. Those measures have produced positive results, as growth in the number of passengers in \npublic buses in 2007 reached 473 million, against 426 million and 359 million in the previous 2 \nyears. \n \n5. \nThe  development  of  bus  services  has  mostly  followed  rather  than  accompanied  urban \nexpansion.  The  route  network  has  a  high  degree  of  overlap  on  the  main  corridors  and  is \nconvoluted, with many deviating lines. Route and station coverage are good in the central area \nbut fall below People\u2019s Republic of China standards in the urban area as a whole, with a route \ncoverage  coefficient  standing  at  0.94  km/km2,  against  a  3\u20134  km/km2  benchmark  in  the  center \nand  2\u20132.5  km/km2  in  adjoining  areas.  There  are  several  gaps  in  service  coverage,  most \nparticularly in Anning. Also, bus services are uniformly structured throughout, while an optimal \nstructure  would  have  a  mass  transit  system  as  a  core,  trunk  lines  using  common  buses,  and \nsmaller feeder lines using minibuses.  \n \n6. \n2020. The number of buses is projected to grow by 1.9 times during that period (Table A3.2). \n \n\nDemand for public transport in Lanzhou is projected to grow by 2.1 times from 2005 to \n\nTable A3.2: Public Transport Development, 2006\u20132020 \n\nPublic Transport \nUrban \nMarket Share \nResidents \n(%) \n(million) \n22 \n2.0 \n28\u201331 \n2.1\u20132.5 \n32\u201336 \n2.7\u20133.2 \n38\u201340 \n3.5\u20134.0 \nSource: Lanzhou Public Traffic Special Plan (2007). \n\nYear \n2006 \n2010 \n2015 \n2020 \n\nPassenger Trips by \nPublic Transport \n(million) \n1.16 \n1.61 \n2.17 \n2.34 \n\nBus Fleet \n(standard \nunits) \n2,016 \n2,350\u20132,600 \n2,800\u20133,150 \n2,900\u20133,300 \n\n \n7. \nParking  Management.  Parking  needs  in  Lanzhou  were  not  taken  into  account \nsufficiently in previous urban plans. The resulting shortage of underground and off-road parking \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nin  central  areas  has  left  drivers  parking  on  sidewalks  and  in  non-motorized  transport  (NMT) \nlanes,  creating  obstacles  to  NMT  traffic  and  reducing  the  attractiveness  of  the  streetscape. \nParking  policies  have  led  to  inefficient  demand  patterns,  increasing  congestion  in  the  central \nbusiness  district.  Currently,  there  is  a  flat  parking  charge  of  CNY2\u20133  regardless  of  the  time \nparked. This is far below the opportunity costs of road space usage, and the Government has \nidentified the need to revamp its parking management and pricing policy. Demand-based pricing \nhas good potential as a tool to manage demand; it would involve differential pricing by area in \nthe  city,  number  of  hours  parked,  and  period  of  the  week.  Rationalizing  parking  space  would \nentail exploring legal options for contracting out parking management. \n \n8. \nNon-Motorized  Transport.  The  mobility  of  pedestrians  and  bicycles  has  started  to \ndecline.  NMT,  still  the  mainstay  of  the  poorer  sections  of  the  society,  has  declined  as  motor \nvehicles  progressively  dominated  the  roads  and  as  trip  distances  grew  in  line  with  the  city's \nexpansion. There are worsening safety problems because pedestrian crossings are few and are \nfrequently obstructed; NMT lanes have been encroached on by motor vehicles, either moving or \nparked;  and  cyclists  are  often  forced  to  operate  in  dangerous  mixed  traffic.  Lack  of  parking \nfacilities and risk of theft are cited as significant impediments for bicycle use.  \n \n9. \nNMT,  as  a  mode  chosen  by  the  users  rather  than  imposed  by  poverty,  will  be  an \nessential element of the city's transport system. An integrated network of protected or separated \nbicycle  lanes  is  needed,  together  with  bicycle  parking  facilities  at  bus  stations.  Bicycle  rental \nschemes  may  be  considered.  For  pedestrians,  the  road  network  needs  to  be  made  safer  with \nappropriate sidewalks, mid-block crossings, and pedestrian signals. Efforts are needed to create \na  more  attractive  streetscape,  as  well  as  to  make  urban  blocks  either  smaller  or  allow  NMT \nthrough traffic. \n \n10. \nTransport  Externalities.  The  increased  use  of  motor  vehicles  has  heightened  road \nsafety  concerns  in  Lanzhou.  The  incidence  and  severity  of  accidents  are  relatively  high  when \ncompared with other cities of similar population. Lanzhou had 723 traffic accidents in 2007 that \ncaused 723 injuries and 305 fatalities, 57% of which were pedestrians (Table A3.3). The fatality \nrate  in  urban  areas  exceeds  100  per  million  habitants,  higher  than  in  Shanghai  (85)  or  the \nEuropean Union average of 88, despite one sixth the rate of motorization. Causes of accidents \ninclude poor road design that does not cater well for NMT traffic, unsafe driving habits, and the \nlack of safety awareness among pedestrians. \n \n\nTable A3.3: Lanzhou City Traffic Accidents \n\nAccidents  Fatalities \n\n  \nItem  \nPedestrians \nBicycles \nTrucks \nCars and Buses \n  Total \n\n360 \n86 \n103 \n174 \n723 \n\n2007 \n\n173 \n38 \n59 \n35 \n305 \n\nInjuries \n317 \n75 \n97 \n234 \n723 \n\n                                   Source: Lanzhou City Traffic Police Brigade. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n30 \n \n\nCONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF URBAN ROADS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  realizing  the  urban  master  plan  by  supporting  the \ndevelopment of the urban road network and the urban mass transport system serving the new \ncity center in Anning. To support rapidly increasing traffic demand, 16 urban road sections will \nbe  constructed  or  reconstructed,  consisting  of  21.4  km  of  new  roads  and  12.4  km  of  existing \nroads.  \n \nThe  proposed  Lanzhou  bus  rapid  transit  will  be  constructed  mainly  in  the  new  city \n2. \ncenter, but the bus rapid transit corridor will extend across the Yellow River, providing a link to \nthe  current  city  center,  passing  through  Dunhuang  Road,  T514,  T514-1,  T514-2,  T532,  and \nT577 from east to west, with a total length of 13.0 km.  \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  incorporate  provisions  for  non-motorized  transport  throughout  the  new \ncity  center.  All  of  the  16  urban  road  sections  excluding  S578  consist  of  traffic  lanes,  non-\nmotorized  transport  lanes  for  bicycles,  and  walkways  for  pedestrians.

The population of Anning in 2007 was 234,400, of which 88% was classified as urban. \nFrom 2005 to 2020, demand for public transport in Lanzhou is expected to grow by 2.1 times, \nthe number of registered passenger vehicles is expected to grow by 6.8 times, and the number \nof  buses  is  expected  to  grow  by  1.9  times.  Bus  rapid  transit  (BRT)  can  sustainably  meet \ndemand  for  urban  transport  in  Lanzhou  and  mitigate  negative  externalities.  It  offers  low-cost, \nefficient, flexible, and environmentally friendly mass transport. BRT will be constructed mainly in \nthe Anning new city center, but the BRT corridor will across the Yellow River and connect to the \ncurrent city center. This connection will increase the efficiency and convenience of BRT as part \nof  Lanzhou's  urban  mass  transport  system  and  strengthen  the  outcome  and  impact  of  the \nLanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project).  \n \nA. \n \nThe  BRT  corridor  has  been  selected  based  on  studies  of  demand  for  public  transport, \n2. \ntaking  into  account  the  needs  of  passengers  and  operational  requirements  of  bus  operators. \nCurrent  bus  route  coverage  provides  a  useful  approximation  of  demand  along  the  corridor. \nAnning Road has the densest bus traffic of the seven operated bus routes (3, 15, 72, 103, 121, \n131, and 310). Based on this demand, Anning Road has the potential to be a successful BRT \ncorridor. The  corridor  has  sufficient  space for  incorporating  BRT  stations and  bus  lanes.  Peak \npassenger flows currently exceed 5,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd), and there is \nstrong demand in both directions throughout the day.  \n \n3. \nTaking  into  account  the  large  amount  of  planned  new  development  in  the  district,  and \nthe removal of city government offices to Anning, peak passenger flows are expected to exceed \n8,000 pphpd by the end of 2010. This would make the Anning Road corridor one of the busier \nBRT systems in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and other countries in the region in terms \nof passenger flows, assuming that all bus passengers use BRT (Figure A5.1).  \n \n\nFigure A5.1: Potential of the Anning BRT Corridor \n\n \n\nn\no\n\ni\nt\nc\ne\nr\ni\nd\n \nr\ne\np\n \nr\nu\no\nh\n \nr\ne\np\n \ns\nr\ne\ng\nn\ne\ns\ns\na\nP\n\n \n \n\n \n\nBRT = bus rapid transit, pphpd = passengers per hour per direction, km/hr = kilometers per hour \nSource: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nBus Rapid Transit Stations \n\nThe BRT corridor will start at Xi Zhan, a train station in the current city center in Qilihe \n4. \nand connected to the current bus center. The corridor will take Dunhuang Road, cross over the \nYellow River, and connect to Anning Road from east to west. The western endpoint of BRT will \nbe  at  Anning  Pu,  a  station  that  is  the  gateway  to  Renshoushan  Park.  The  length  of  the  BRT \ncorridor will be 13 km. \n \nB. \n \nBRT  stations  are  a  critical  feature  of  BRT  systems  because  they  set  limits  on  system \n5. \ncapacity. The design of BRT stations directly affects the traffic efficiency of BRT corridors and \nroad  safety  for  passengers.  High-quality  station  design,  including  station  dimensions  and \nconfiguration to match, is essential for a well-functioning BRT system. The stations for Lanzhou \nBRT  need to  be  designed  taking  into  account the  experiences  of  existing  BRT  systems  in the \nPRC  and  elsewhere.  The  proposed  22  stations  in  the  Lanzhou  BRT  will  provide  average \nspacing of around 600 meters between stations, taking into account the current locations of the \nbus stations, Lanzhou Urban Master Plan, Lanzhou New City Area Plan, and findings of demand \nsurveys, including of the number of passengers at peak hours in the morning and evening. One \nof  the  lessons  from  other  BRTs  in  the  PRC  is  that  BRT  stations  should  not  be  located  near \nintersections,  as  this  often  results  in  vehicles  blocking  the  intersections  and  pedestrian \ncrossings. All stations of the Lanzhou BRT are located at least 75 meters from intersections but \nclose  to  existing  bus  stops.  Another  lesson  is  that  some  BRT  systems  fail  to  realize  potential \ntime  saving  benefits  for  bus  passengers  and  road  users  if  there  are  long  queues  at  ticket \nwindows, heavy crush loading during peak periods, or BRT corridors open to mixed traffic and \nprone to congestion during peak periods. The length and width of the station will be determined \nbased  on  demand  surveys,  and  each  station  will  include  bicycle  parking,  a  fare  collection \nsystem, sliding doors for safety, light and water, and real-time bus operation information boards.  \n \n6. \nA  further  lesson  is  the  need  to  build  in  potential  for  future  expansion  of  BRT \ninfrastructure,  particularly  in  stations.  The  Lanzhou  BRT  will  allow  for  system  capacity  to  be \nexpanded  in  the  future  at  low  cost  because  it  will  reserve  a  green  median  that  can  later  be \nconverted  into  additional  station  extensions  and  bus  lanes.  Figure  A5.2  shows  an  example  of \nshort-term BRT station design (the diagram above) and medium term (the diagram below). The \nsize  of  station  in  the  diagram  above  is  designed  to  meet  short-term  demand  for  BRT.  This \ndesign  minimizes  initial  construction  and  equipment  costs  for  the  station.  Space  for  future \nexpansion is secured in green medians. Until future station expansion, the green medians serve \nas buffer zones to improve landscape appearance and road safety. The diagram below shows \nmedium-term  BRT  station  design.  The  green  area  is  set  back  and  the  stations  are  expanded. \nFuture  demand  is recalculated  at  this  stage  of  expansion,  so  the  risk  of a gap  between  future \ndemand and size of the stations is minimized. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n34 \n \n\nFigure A5.2: Short-Term and Medium-Term Bus Rapid Transit Design \n\nGreen Median (Phase II \n\nGreen Median (Phase II) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNotes: \n1.

Figure A5.3 compares flexible and \nclosed BRT systems. In a closed system, BRT buses operate only inside the BRT corridor. In a \nflexible system, selected BRT routes operate both inside and outside the BRT corridor and allow \nfor  both  existing  buses  and  specialized  BRT  buses  if  introduced.  The  BRT  systems  in  Dalian, \nChangzhou,  Hangzhou,  and  Jinan  are  flexible.  Those  in  Beijing,  Chongqing,  and  Xiamen  are \nclosed.  \n \n8. \nThe  Lanzhou  BRT  will  use  the  flexible  system,  so  there  is  no  need  to  establish  a \ncompany for BRT operation. The Lanzhou Public Transport Group, a state-owned company and \nthe  current  bus  operator  in  Lanzhou,  will  use  the  BRT  lanes  with  existing  environmentally \nfriendly  buses  that  run  on  compressed  natural  gas.  No  other  bus  company  now  exists  in \nLanzhou, but if a new qualified bus company is established, the BRT lanes should be open to it. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\n \nFigure A5.3: Flexible versus Closed System \n\nFlexible Operations \n\nBRT = bus rapid transit \nSource: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. \n\nClosed Operations \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n36 \n \n\nASSISTANCE FOR CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM APPLICATION \nFROM ADB'S CARBON MARKET INITIATIVE \n\nincludes \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  (the  Project) \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nthe \ndevelopment of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system that may be eligible for carbon credits under \nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The Project is in compliance \nwith  relevant  policy,  regulatory,  and  development  plans  as  set  forth  by  the  government \nauthorities of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In particular, the BRT component is in line \nwith  all  clauses  stipulated  in  the  Measures  for  Operation  and  Management  of  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  Projects  in  China  issued  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission.  The  BRT  component  will  meet  the  objective  of  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change  and  will  be  eligible  to  gain  carbon  credits  under  the  CDM  if \nregistered  with  the  CDM  executive  board.  If  successfully  registered  and  implemented  as \nplanned,  BRT  stands  to  generate  approximately  5,000  certified  emission  reductions  (CERs) \nannually. CER prices vary depending on market conditions, but at $10 per CER,1 for example, \nthe Project can generate additional annual revenue of $50,000.  \n \n2. \nADB  Mission  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism.  The  mission  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific. A key means to achieve \nthis  mission  is  through  financing  infrastructure  and  other  projects  in  ADB  developing  member \ncountries.  The  CDM  promotes  sustainable  development  in  developing  countries.  CDM  rules \nrequire  certification  from  host  country  governments  that  the  projects  have  voluntary  initiatives \nthat help them achieve sustainable development.  \n\n3. \nADB  has  taken  several  initiatives  to  mainstream  climate  change  considerations  in  its \nfunding.  ADB\u2019s  current  CDM  support  program  is  administered  through  the  Carbon  Market \nInitiative  (CMI),  managed  by  the  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  of  the  ADB  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department. CMI has three components: (i) upfront carbon financing \nthrough the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund and the Future Carbon Fund; (ii) CDM-related technical \nsupport  through  the  technical  support  facility  (TSF);  and  (iii)  marketing  support  for  residual \ncarbon credits through the Credit Marketing Facility. \n\nADB's CMI supports the proposed Project\u2019s application to the CDM with a national expert \n\n4. \nin the PRC and through CDM experts at ADB headquarters. \n\nApplication to the Clean Development Mechanism \n\nB. \n \n5. \nMethodology  for  Estimating  Baseline  and  Project  Emissions.  CDM  projects  are \nexpected to establish a baseline scenario that would have prevailed if the CDM project had not \nbeen  undertaken.  The  proposed  BRT  projects  falls  under  sectoral  scope  7  (transport),  as \ndefined  under  CDM  modalities  and  procedures,  and  meets  the  applicability  conditions  and \nrequirements of the approved large-scale CDM methodology, ACM0016-Baseline Methodology \nfor Mass Rapid Transit Projects (Version 01). \n \n6. \nBaseline  Survey  and  Data  Collection.  ACM0016 involves about 21 equations and 29 \nparameters  for  calculating  baseline,  projects,  and  leakage  emissions.  Since  November  2008, \nADB's TSF has discussed the baseline survey and data collection with the project management \noffice to determine the baseline scenario of the BRT project. The TSF has supported the project \n                                                 \n1  The current market for CERs extends to the end of first commitment period in 2012. Negotiations for the second \nKyoto Protocol commitment period are in progress. Should there be an agreement on the modalities, it is possible \nthat after 2012 CERs may fetch a price higher than the current price of \u20ac8\u2013\u20ac9. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nmanagement  office  in  preparing  a  plan  for  implementing  a  baseline  survey  and  discussed  in \ndetail the specific survey methods and statistical requirements for specific parameters. \n\n7. \nData  for  some  parameters  were  sourced  from  relevant  local  authority  statistics  and \nrecords. An on-site survey will be carried out to collect the remaining data required. A range of \nparameters  in  relation  to  specific  fuel  consumption,  occupancy  rate,  average  speed,  average \ndistance  driven  and  so  forth  of  various  vehicle  types  are  involved.  Questionnaire-based \nsubjective survey is included as part of the on-site survey, for the purpose of seeking responses \nfrom passengers on a series of travel-related questions, such as the origins and destinations of \ntheir trips, choices of vehicles, etc. However, since ACM0016 does not provide a clear guidance \non how to determine on ex-ante basis some of the parameters of ACM0016, requests need to \nbe  submitted  to  the  UNFCCC  secretariat  to  seek  authoritative  explanation  and  clarification \nbefore the baseline traffic survey plan can be finalized. \n\n8. \nIn  parallel  to  the  preparation  of  the  baseline  traffic  survey  implementation  plan,  the \nproposed  Lanzhou  BRT  Project-specific  Feasibility  Study  Report  (FSR)  is  being  developed  by \nan  experienced  professional  design  institute.  Besides  the  system  design,  investment  and \nfinancial analysis especially related to BRT system, the emphasis of the FSR will also be placed \non  traffic  forecasting,  option  analysis  of  various  bus  routes,  etc.,  which  is  the  key  document \ndirectly  determining  the  prospect  of  the  project  development.  It  provides  the  authoritative \ntechnical,  economic  and  financial  information  based  on  which  the  CDM  Project  Design \nDocument  (PDD)  will  be  prepared.  More  importantly,  the  FSR  is  the  fundamental  reference \ndocument  that  will  qualify  the  project  for  local  governmental  approval  and  enable  the  local \nproject  proponent  to  take  the  project  forward,  from  detailed  technical  design,  infrastructure \nconstruction and system set-up, through system operation and management, construction and \nsystem set-up, and through system operation and management. \n\nTimeline  and  Responsibilities.

It  is  inefficient  and \ncostly in the long term. Regulatory and demand-side policies offer complementary instruments \nto meet the needs of users. Traffic demand management (TDM) is the process of adjusting or \nadapting  the  use  of  an  existing  road  system  to  meet  specified  objectives  without  resorting  to \nsubstantial  new  road  construction.  Effective  traffic  management  can  increase  the  capacity  of \nexisting  transport  infrastructure  by  managing  traffic  flows  and  helping  to  address  traffic \ncongestion,  road  accidents,  and  vehicle  emissions. The  proposed  Lanzhou  Sustainable  Urban \nTransport Project (the Project) will support (i) establishing a TDM strategy and reforming policy \non  traffic  management  in  Lanzhou,  (ii)  developing  an  advanced  traffic  control  system  (signal \ncontrol), and (iii) preparing a development plan for non-motorized transport (NMT). \n \nA. \n \n2. \nTDM  strategies  address  traffic  congestion  by  reducing  or  optimizing  demand  for \ntransport and influencing user behavior. TDM attempts to influence travelers before they get into \ntheir  cars  by  promoting  alternative  modes  and  destinations  of  travel  and  providing  improved \noptions  for  drivers.  A  first  set  of  measures  aims  to  make  efficient  transport  options\u2014such  as \npark-and-ride,  work  schedule  adjustments, \nflexi-time  and/or  compressed  workweek, \ntelecommuting,  and  car  pooling\u2014more  attractive  to  users,  as  well  as  facilitate  NMT  with  safe, \nintegrated  walking  and  biking  paths  and  bicycle  parking.  A  second  set  is  market-based \nmeasures to reorient user behavior through price incentives. This may include road tolls that are \neither  fixed  or  vary  with  congestion,  area  or  cordon  pricing  for  urban  centers,  pricing  parking \nspaces, subsidizing transit fares, pay-as-you-drive vehicle insurance schemes, and increases to \nfuel or vehicle taxes. A third set of measures limits traffic to certain types of vehicles in certain \nareas or corridors, road rationing through alternative driving schemes (such as in Sao Paulo), or \nvehicle purchase auctions such as in Singapore or Shanghai.  \n \n3. \nThe impacts of market measures are summarized in Table A7.1. Strategies to manage \ntraffic  demand  have  sometimes  failed  because  public  entities  tried  to  sell  undesirable  public \ntransport or NMT to unwilling users.  \n \n\nTable A7.1: Impacts of Different Types of Pricing \n\nVehicle \nFees \nX \n\nFuel \nPrice \n  \n\nFixed \nToll \n  \n\nVariable \nToll \n  \n\nArea \nPricing \n \n\nCar \nInsurance \n \n\nParking \nFee \nX \n\nTransit \nFares \nX \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nX \n\nX \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nType of Impacts \nVehicle Ownership.

The implementation plan includes the following elements: \n\nThe general framework for the new traffic control system in Anning is detailed in Table \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\ncomprehensive management system; \ntraffic  control  sub-center  linked  to  the  central  Lanzhou  Public  Security  Bureau \nTraffic Police Brigade control center; \nnew  sets  of  on-street  signal  hardware  at  about  70  junctions,  including  signal \nheads and controllers, using cost- and energy-efficient light-emitting diode signal \nlamps instead of incandescent lamps; \nspecial pedestrian-actuated signals on crossings of highly trafficked roads; \nvideo-detection  equipment  with  software  to  detect  incidents,  monitor  congested \nareas, and identify speeders and lane violators; \nvariable message signs with light-emitting diodes on major roads; and \nelectronic  police  (e-police)  capability  to  detect  stoplight  violations  and  mobile \nequipment for officers to use for spot control of traffic and parking violations. \nThe Project will support the deployment of this system in the project area as well as the \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n6. \nimplementation of the comprehensive management system to be used citywide. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n40 \n \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Demand Management Strategy and Policy Reform \n\n \n7. \nThe  Project  will  streamline  TDM  concepts  and  strategy  in  the  Lanzhou  transport \ndevelopment.  The  scope  of  TDM  and  policy  reform,  such  as  (i)  developing  a  TDM  strategy, \nincluding  recommendations,  action  plans,  and  TDM  guidelines,  that  will  enable  LMG  to  build \ncapacity for TDM and incorporate TDM concepts and strategy into future city planning, such as \nthe  urban  master  plan,  public  transport  plans,  and  urban  road  design;  (ii)  reforming  on  a  pilot \nbasis  the  current  pricing  policy  for  public  parking  by  introducing  a  demand-based  pricing \nsystem;  (iii)  developing  the  concept  of  pilot  traffic-calming  zones,  which  restrict  high-speed \ndriving, through traffic, and trucks with traffic regulations and physical barriers; and (iv) advising \non the institutional coordination of TDM issues to LMG.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nTraffic  demand  management  strategy  and  guidelines.  The  Project  will \n(a)   evaluate  the  midterm  and  long-term  impacts  of  user-attracting,  market-\nbased,  and  restrictive  TDM  measures  to  be  developed;  (b)   prepare  a  set  of \nguidelines, strategies, and tactics by which the city integrates TDM concepts into \nthe future 4th Urban Master Plan (2010\u20132020) and 12th Transport 5-Year Plan; \n(c)  revise  municipal  technical  normative  documents  to  integrate  TDM  concepts \nand the accessibility needs of people with restricted mobility; and (d) consolidate \nthese outputs as a TDM strategy for LMG and guidelines for their wide use. \nDemand-based  parking  management. An efficient approach to reducing traffic \nin urban areas is to charge a relatively high parking fee in the city center, thereby \nmaking  car  use  less  attractive  than  public  transport.  The  Project  will  develop  a \nnew parking policy and management plan in collaboration with the administration \noverseeing parking management, including the creation of a parking supply-and-\ndemand database and a demand-based pricing management plan. \nTraffic-calming  zones.  The  Project  will  include  a  concept  study  and  technical \nguidelines  for  implementing  traffic-calming  zones,  which  restrict  high-speed \ndriving, through traffic, and trucks with traffic regulations and physical barriers in \nresidential districts. \nInstitution  building. The Project will advise on strengthening TDM coordination \nin  LMG.  The  dispersal  of  responsibilities  for  TDM  is  an  obstacle  to  efficient \npolicy-making.  In  Lanzhou,  TDM  has  recently  been  taken  over  by  an  ad-hoc \nworking  group  composed  of  representatives  of  the  Traffic  Police  Brigade, \nFinancial  Bureau,  Construction  Committee,  Land  Planning  Bureau,  Land \nAdministration  Bureau,  and  Public  Transport  Group.  This  coordination \nmechanism  is  a  substantial  improvement  but  will  prove  insufficient  in  the  long \nterm to fully integrate TDM in the administration's normal business processes. In \nmany other countries, administrations have created dedicated units that manage \nTDM  programs  and  contribute  to  urban  plans.  They  have  a  mixed  staff  of  road \nengineers,  road  traffic  operators,  and  transport  and  urban  planners.  Creating \nsuch a unit in LMG would likely bring substantial long-term benefits. \n\n3. \n\nNon-Motorized Transport Development Plan \n\n \n8. \nThe mobility of pedestrians and bicycles has started to decline. NMT, still the mainstay \nof  the  poorer  sections  of  the  society,  has  declined  as  motor  vehicles  progressively  dominated \nthe roads and as trip distances grew in line with the city's expansion. NMT, as a mode chosen \nby users rather than imposed by poverty, will be an essential element of the transport system. \nAn  integrated  network  of  protected  or  separated  bicycle  lanes  will  be  created,  bicycle  parking \nfacilities will be built at bus stations, and bicycle rental schemes will be considered.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\n \n \nTo  make  clear  recommendations  for  NMT  planning  in  Lanzhou,  further  investigation  of \n9. \nthe  current  status  of  NMT  is  required.  Reasons  for  decline  may  include  the  loss  of  secure \nbicycle  parking  and  worsening  crime.  Many  junction  designs  and  roadway  designs  are \nsuboptimal  from  the  point  of  view  of  pedestrian  and  cyclist  safety.  A  survey  will  provide \ninformation for establishing a strategy to support NMT.  \n \n10. \nconsolidating the outputs of the two following components. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  consulting  services  for  designing  the  NMT  Development  Plan, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIssues  and  solutions  for  non-motorized  transport  promotion. The study will \nidentify  specific  reasons  of  declining  NMT  share  and  recommend  solutions,  as \nwell  as  specific  needs  for  improvement,  such  as  (a)  design  improvement,  as \nmany  junction  designs  and  roadway  designs  are  suboptimal  from  the  point  of \nview of pedestrian and cyclist safety; (b) better enforcement of traffic regulations \nfor effective NMT lanes, as some NMT lanes are misused for driving and parking; \n(c)  removing  black  spots  of  serious  pedestrian  and  bicycle  accidents; \n(d)  improving bicycle networks and connectivity for direct, safe, and secure links \nbetween residential and commercial or business areas; and (e) improving bicycle \nparking  facilities,  as  areas  with  major  bus  demand  have  either  reduced  or \ninsecure bicycle parking. \nNon-motorized  transport  development  framework.  The  study  will  prepare \n(a) a  financing  framework  for  NMT  interventions,  (b)  the  introduction  of  transit-\noriented  development,  (c)  an  incentive  scheme  for  shopkeepers  and  employers \nto  support  NMT,  (d)  engineering  normative  designs  for  road  networks,  and \n(e)  campaigns for NMT promotion and safety. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category a \n\n$ Million \nLocal \n\nForeign \n\nExchange  Currency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nCNY million \nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n% of Total \nBase Cost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n4\n2\n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\n \n9.64 \n20.38 \n \n2.22 \n3.64 \n0.37 \n\n5.48 \n \n1.29 \n0.40 \n0.39 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n43.81 \n \n3.81 \n\n2.58 \n6.39 \n \n\n9.76 \n\n0.23 \n\n9.99 \n\n \n86.80 \n34.84 \n \n8.88 \n14.54 \n0.37 \n\n22.77 \n \n11.64 \n0.60 \n0.11 \n21.42 \n\n138.32 \n\n0.47 \n\n340.76 \n \n31.01 \n\n8.86 \n39.87 \n \n\n39.45 \n\n0.00 \n\n39.45 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n96.44 \n55.22 \n \n11.10 \n18.18 \n0.74 \n\n28.25 \n \n12.93 \n1.00 \n0.50 \n21.42 \n\n138.32 \n\n0.47 \n\n384.57 \n \n34.82 \n\n11.44 \n46.26 \n \n\n49.21 \n\n0.23 \n\n49.44 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Total \nCost \n\n \n659.12 \n377.40 \n \n75.86 \n124.25 \n5.06 \n\n193.07 \n \n88.37 \n6.83 \n3.42 \n146.39 \n\n \n593.23 \n238.11 \n \n60.69 \n99.37 \n2.53 \n\n155.62 \n \n79.55 \n4.10 \n0.75 \n146.39 \n\n945.35 \n\n945.35 \n\n3.21 \n\n3.21 \n\n2,328.92 \n \n211.94 \n\n2,628.34 \n \n237.98 \n\n60.55 \n272.49 \n \n\n269.62 \n\n0.00 \n\n78.19 \n316.16 \n \n\n336.33 \n\n1.57 \n\n269.62 \n\n337.90 \n\n \n65.88 \n139.29 \n \n15.17 \n24.88 \n2.53 \n\n37.45 \n \n8.82 \n2.73 \n2.67 \n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n299.42 \n \n26.04 \n\n17.63 \n43.68 \n \n\n66.70 \n\n1.57 \n\n68.28 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n20.08 \n11.50 \n \n2.31 \n3.79 \n0.15 \n\n5.88 \n \n2.69 \n0.21 \n0.10 \n4.46 \n\n28.80 \n\n0.10 \n\n80.07 \n \n7.25 \n\n2.38 \n9.63 \n \n\n10.25 \n\n0.05 \n\n10.29 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ne \n\n \n\n2. \n \n \n \n\n \n3. \n \n \n4. \n5. \n6. \n\n7. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n \n  \nInvestment Costsb \n1. \n \n \n\nCivil Works \na.

The  Project  will  not  earn  any  direct  revenue  from \nconstructing urban roads or BRT facilities.  \n \n2. \nThe Executing Agency for the Project is the Lanzhou Municipal Government (LMG). The \nnewly  established  Lanzhou  Municipal  Foreign  Loan  Utilization  Office (LMFLUO)  is responsible \nfor  managing  and  coordinating  foreign  loan  utilization  in  Lanzhou,  with  the  director  of  the \nLanzhou  Municipal  Development  and  Reform  Commission  acting  as  the  director  of  LMFLUO. \nThe project management office has been established in and under LMFLUO.  \n \n3. \nThe Project involves the construction of new roads, rehabilitation of existing roads, and \ncreation of a BRT system, with 40.8% of the project cost for the construction and rehabilitation \nof  roads  and  3.0%  for  BRT  stations  and  equipment.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will \namount to 39.5% of the project cost.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe Project will be funded from three sources: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan, \na  domestic  bank  loan  from  the  Bank  of  China  (BOC),  and  the  LMG  annual  budget.  The  ADB \nloan will have a term of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. The interest rate for the ADB \nloan  is  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate\u2013based  lending \nfacility and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum. BOC is one of the leading bank in the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  with  a  recorded  profit  of  CNY64.4  billion  for  2008  and  an  asset \nbase of CNY6,952 billion on 31 December 2008. The BOC loan will comprise a series of annual \nloans throughout construction, with interest paid quarterly and full repayment of the principal in \n10 years and a grace period of 5 years at an estimated annual interest rate of 5.94%. \n\nProject Financing and Its Effects on Lanzhou Municipal Government's Cash Flow \n\nAs  the  Project  will  not  earn  any  direct  revenue,  the  debt  service  requirements  of  both \n5. \nloans  are  the  responsibility  of  LMG  and  will  be  paid  through  the  LMG  annual  budget.  The \nadditional  cash  flow  requirements  of  LMG  during  project  implementation  and  up  to  2033  were \nanalyzed.  Throughout  the  period,  the  additional  financing  needed  each  year  for  repaying  the \nADB loan will not exceed 1% of the total budget of LMG.  \n\n6. \nThe Project is to develop infrastructure supporting a new city center for Lanzhou with a \nfast-growing  population  and  rapidly  increasing  land  prices.  LMG  expects  to  benefit  from  land \nvalue  increases  after  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  If  any  such  land  value  increases  take \nplace, it will contribute positively to narrowing the budget deficit of LMG. As these possible sales \nof  land  are  not  part  of  the  project  scope,  potential  revenues  from  them  have  not  been \nconsidered in evaluating the financial capacity of LMG.  \n\nProject Maintenance Costs \n\nC. \n \n7. \nA public bus company, Lanzhou Public Transport Group, is the sole public bus operator \nin Lanzhou and will handle services in the BRT lanes. City buses operating on some designated \nroutes  will  be  moved  to  the  newly  established  BRT  lanes.  The  main  responsibility  for  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n50 \n \n\nsustainability of project assets will be with LMG. Details of maintenance arrangements are given \nbelow.  \n \n8. \nAfter the completion of the Project, roads and bridges will be maintained by Anning and \nQilihe  district  urban  infrastructure  management  stations,  utilities  will  be  maintained  by  the \nInfrastructure Management Station of Anning District, advanced traffic management systems will \nbe  maintained  by  the  Lanzhou  Municipal  Traffic  Police  Brigade,  BRT  stations  and  ticketing \nmachines will be operated and maintained by the Lanzhou Public Transport Group, platforms of \nthe BRT stations and BRT lanes will be maintained by the Infrastructure Management Station of \nAnning District, street lights will be maintained by the Street Lightning Management Section, and \nthe  advanced  environmental  monitoring  system  will  be  maintained  by  the  Anning  District \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau. This arrangement for operation and maintenance is practical \nand appropriate.  \n\n9. \nIn addition to debt servicing, LMG needs to allocate funds for maintaining project assets. \nMaintenance  costs  are estimated for  project  improvements  on the  BRT  and  other routes.  BRT \nroute improvements include stations and roadway elements. Non-BRT routes include only road \npavement-related maintenance. \n\n10. \n \n\nTwo types of maintenance work must be financed after the completion of the Project: \n(i) \n\nroutine annual maintenance such as,  \n(a) \n\nfor  roadways,  pothole  repair,  crack  sealing,  guardrail  safety,  debris \nremoval, and snow removal; \nfor  stations,  window  replacement,  bench  repair,  painting,  landscaping, \ntrash and graffiti removal, and equipment repair. \n\n(b) \n\n(ii) \n\nperiodic maintenance of roadways, such as major surface replacement.  \n\n \n11. \nThe following assumptions were used to estimate the annual maintenance costs of the \nProject. Routine roadway maintenance costs are based on cost per square meter, while station \nmaintenance  costs  used  a  standard  annual  cost  for  each  of  the  two  types  of  station  sizes. \nInformation technology equipment maintenance is also based on an annual standard cost. For \nroadway costs, it is assumed that periodic maintenance is needed every 7 years.  \n\n12. \nBy  applying  these  assumptions  for  the  project  roadways  and  stations,  maintaining \nproject  assets  has  the  following  maintenance  costs.  The  funds  to  cover  these  costs  will  come \ndirectly  from  the  LMG  annual  operating  budget  through  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Management \nDivision,  whose  current,  2009  annual  urban  road  maintenance  budget  is  CNY427.93  million. \nThe  additional  maintenance  expenditures  that  are  needed  for  maintaining  project  roads  will \nincrease the annual maintenance budget of the Urban Infrastructure Management Division only \nby  3.7%.  LMG  has  given  assurance  that  adequate  funds  will  be  allocated  to  maintain  project \nroads.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nTable A12: Annual Maintenance Cost \n($ million) \n\nBRT Route \n\nStations \n\nRoadway \n\nNon-BRT \nRoute \nRoadway \n\n \n\n0.08 \n0.08 \n0.08 \n0.08 \n0.08 \n0.08 \n5.06 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.09 \n0.10 \n5.06 \n0.10 \n0.10 \n0.10 \n0.11 \n0.11 \n0.11 \n\nYear \n\n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n2033 \n\n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n0.60 \n\nTotal \n\n2.50 \n2.54 \n2.57 \n2.61 \n2.65 \n2.70 \n62.21 \n2.78 \n2.82 \n2.87 \n2.91 \n2.96 \n3.01 \n62.21 \n3.11 \n3.16 \n3.21 \n3.26 \n3.31 \n3.37 \n\n1.83 \n1.86 \n1.90 \n1.94 \n1.98 \n2.02 \n56.55 \n2.10 \n2.14 \n2.18 \n2.23 \n2.27 \n2.32 \n56.55 \n2.41 \n2.46 \n2.51 \n2.56 \n2.61 \n2.66 \n\nBRT = bus rapid transit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nClean Development Mechanism \n\n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  Carbon  Market  Initiative  is  a  value-added  service  extended  to  ADB-supported \nprojects for clean energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The Project \nwill receive support from the Carbon Market Initiative for preparing an application to the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  to  approve  BRT  for  trading  in  certified  emission  reductions  (CERs). \nThe  potential for  CERs  was  initially  accessed  based  on  the  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) \nemissions  resulting  from  BRT  implementation.  The  reduction  in  carbon  emissions  is  a  direct \nresult  of  the  expected  modal  shift  away  from  private  vehicles  and  into  public  transit  that  is \nfacilitated by this Project.  \n\n14. \nIt is assumed that the number of passenger trips in Anning District is unaltered with the \nintroduction of a BRT. However, passengers are expected to switch from one mode to another. \nThe  diverted  traffic  from  all  vehicles  to  the  BRT  will  reduce  CO2  emissions  in  Anning.  If  the \nProject is registered under the Clean Development Mechanism, it will likely receive 5,000 CERs \nper  year.  CER  prices  fluctuate  depending  on  market  conditions,  but  applying  a  conservative \nestimate  of  $10  per  CER  (discounted),  the  project  can  generate  an  additional  annual  revenue \nstream of $50,000 or $0.5 million over the next 10 years. This additional income can help LMG \nmeet part of its BRT operating and maintenance expenses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n52 \n \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS  \n \n\n1. \nMethodology  and  Assumptions.  The  economic  assessment  conducted  for  the \nLanzhou  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project  (the  Project)  follows  the  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects 1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The evaluation period is \nfrom 2009 to 2033, with the period from mid-2009 to mid-2014 being project implementation and \nthe  20-year  period  from  mid-2014  to  2033  being  project  operation.  The  commencement  of \nproject  implementation  in mid-2009  assumes  ABD\u2019s  approval  of retroactive financing for  some \nresettlement and civil works. For all quantifiable project costs and benefits, the unit of account \nused is the domestic price expressed in the national currency of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe Chinese Yuan (CNY). All project costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2009 prices. \nFor converting foreign costs to domestic cost equivalents, the shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.03 from a recently approved ADB road project has been used.2 \n \n2. \nAlternatives  Analysis.  A  number  of  alternatives  were  considered  for  the  Project.  The \n\u201cno action\u201d alternative addresses the likely consequences of not implementing the Project. This \nalternative would work against the goals of the economic development in Lanzhou by allowing \nthe build-up of traffic congestion and air and noise pollution. \n \n3. \nmanagement\u201d would have the following consequences:  \n\nThe alternative of \"no investment in bus rapid transit (BRT) facilities or advanced traffic \n\n(i) \n\nExisting travel behavior trends would continue, with high growth in private vehicle \nuse  and  associated  environmental  degradation  and  declining  use  of \nenvironmentally friendly and energy-efficient public transport. \n\n(ii)  Without  advanced  traffic  control,  ever-rising  traffic  volumes  would  become \n\nincreasingly slow and dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.  \n\n(iii)  Without an advanced environmental monitoring system, the information available \nto  decision-makers  about  sources  and  levels  of  pollution  in  Anning  would  be \ninadequate,  and  it  would  be  difficult  to  formulate  an  appropriate  environmental \npolicy to address air pollution issues. \n\n(iv)  Without institutional capacity enhancement, local agencies would not be able to \nintroduce effective sector management strategies for sustainable urban transport. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n \n4. \nPossible alternative interventions were considered to meet growing transport demand in \nAnning  as  part  of  the  approved  Lanzhou  City  Master  Plan.  Options  were  evaluated  in  light  of \nenvironmental impacts, effects on land acquisition and resettlement, traffic flow and safety, and \nproject costs. The recommended project road location and alignment option were selected after \nthe analysis. \n \nA. \n \n5. \nThree  types  of  economic  costs  were  included  in  the  evaluation:  (i)  initial  investment, \n(ii) additional  investment,  and  (iii)  annual  recurring  costs.  The  initial  investment  includes \nresettlement  costs,  including  for  temporary  land  use,  building  replacement,  relocation  and \nreplacement of other facilities, compensation for standing crops, and administration costs. The \nopportunity  cost  of  land  is  treated  as  an  economic  value  not  included  as  part  of  the  initial \ninvestment  schedule  but  as  part  of  recurring  costs.  Environmental  control  costs  include  all \nmitigation and monitoring expenses during project implementation from 2009 to 2014. Initial civil \n\n                                                 \n \n2   ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  for  the  Xinjiang  Regional  Road  Improvement  Project  (Korla\u2013Kuqa  Section).  Manila \n(Loan 2393\u2013PRC). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\n \n\nworks  costs  are  estimated for  each  of the  11  new  roads  and  6  reconstructed  roads.  For  each \nroad,  the  civil  works  cost  was  divided  into  earthworks,  pavement,  drainage  and  utilities, \nmiscellaneous including safety, and professional services. Civil works and environmental control \ncosts  are  divided  into  traded  and  non-traded  costs.  Traded  materials  are  further  divided  into \ncement,  steel,  construction  equipment,  and  other  traded  materials.  For  cement  and  steel,  the \nconversion  factors  are  0.795  and  0.940.  For  equipment  and  other  traded  materials,  the \nconversion  factor  is  0.898.  The  shadow  wage  rate  factor  for  skilled  labor  is  1.00  and  the \nopportunity cost of unskilled labor is assumed at 0.67. Physical contingency is assumed at 10% \nof the base cost for civil works, resettlement, and environmental costs. \n \n6. \nAdditional investment consists of periodic maintenance every 7 years, in 2020 and 2027, \nat a cost equal to two thirds of the initial economic cost for pavement and 20% of the initial cost \nfor  drainage  and  utilities,  bridges  and  structures,  and  miscellaneous  costs  (excluding  land \nacquisition and resettlement). The additional investment schedule includes the residual value of \nfixed  assets  estimated  at  a  30-year  economic  life  with  no  scrap  value  and  straight  line \ndepreciation. Annual recurring costs include (i) routine road and bridge maintenance and (ii) the \nopportunity cost of land. The national standard of CNY2 per square meter in 2008 is assumed to \nbe  the  cost  of  routine  maintenance  of  the  project  road  and  bridge  surface  area  for  economic \nanalysis.  This  rate  is  increased  annually  at  2%  to  account  for  the  increase  in  maintenance \nrequirements caused by the traffic load. The routine maintenance of roadside greenery, lighting, \nand  other  items,  estimated  at  CNY3  per  square  meter,  is  added  to  the  annual  pavement \nmaintenance  cost.  These  costs  are  expressed  in  economic  terms  using  the  following  share  of \ncost  components  in  the  nominal  cost:  cement  25%,  steel  5%,  other  traded  materials  5%, \nuntraded  materials  15%,  skilled  labor  20%,  unskilled  labor  10%,  and  equipment  20%.  In \nestimating  the  opportunity  cost  of  land,  the  crop  value  of  CNY110,660  per  mu  of  irrigated \nfarmland and other land is used. The estimation assumes productivity increases of 4% per year \nfor farmland and 5% per year for other land. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nProject benefits are broken down into the following five categories: (i) vehicle operating \ncost (VOC) savings, (ii) diverted traffic benefits, (iii) generated traffic benefits, (iv) time savings \nbenefits, and (v) other benefits. \n \n8. \nVehicle  Operating  Cost  Savings.  There  are  two  major  types  of  VOC  savings \nassociated  with  the  Project,  which  are  estimated  separately.  The  first  is  related  to  the \nreconstruction of existing roads included in the Project\u2019s scope. The current condition of roads \nto  be  reconstructed  is  characterized  by  high  surface  roughness,  which  causes  higher  VOCs \nfrom  increased  wear  and  tear  and  more  frequent  vehicle  repairs.  The  second  type  of  VOC  is \nrelated to congestion along project roads. Particularly in urban areas, congestion is an endemic \nproblem  as  vehicular  traffic  increases,  coupled  with  non-motorized  transport.  High  congestion \nlowers  operating  speeds  for  less-than-optimal  utilization  of  the  vehicle\u2019s  power  train,  braking \nsystem, and other components, causing higher VOCs. \n \n9. \nThe principal methodology used for both types of VOC savings is the VOC component of \nthe Highway Development Model Version 4. For each vehicle type the model assumes specific \nparameter  values  describing  the  vehicle\u2019s  configuration,  engineering  characteristics,  operation, \nand  cost.  Parameter  estimates  are  provided  for  a  cubic  function  (second-order  polynomial)  of \nVOC  with  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  as  the  independent  variable  describing  surface \nroughness. Another mathematical relationship is estimated by the model as a cubic function of \nspeed with IRI as an independent variable. For estimating VOC savings on reconstructed roads, \nthe  IRI  is  assumed  to  be  8  under  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  conditions  and  2  under  \u201cwith  project\u201d \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n54 \n \n\nconditions. Table A13.1 shows the VOC cost per vehicle-kilometer for different types of vehicles \nat  IRI  8  and  2.  The  VOC  difference  in  nominal  terms  is  restated  in  economic  terms  and  used \nwith the normal traffic projections to estimate the benefits associated with reconstructed roads. \nCongestion  cost  savings  is  the  second  item  of  benefits.  The  degree  of  congestion  directly \ndetermines  the  average  operating  speed  of  vehicles.  To  estimate  this  benefit,  multiple  runs  of \nthe VOC model were made so that point observations could be made between the independent \nvariable (speed) and the dependent variable (VOC), and a second-order polynomial curve was \nfitted  with  resultant  parameter  estimates  for  each  vehicle  type.  The  congestion  savings  have \nbeen estimated using these equations for normal traffic. \n \n\nTable A13.1: VOC and Average Vehicle Speed at IRI 2 and 8 \n\nVehicle Type \n\nVOC @ IRI 8 \n($/vkm) \n0.360 \n0.345 \n0.360 \n0.316 \n0.458 \n0.374 \n0.683 \n2.105 \n0.077 \n\nVOC @ IRI 2 \n($/vkm) \n0.277 \n0.268 \n0.282 \n0.284 \n0.346 \n0.276 \n0.451 \n1.197 \n0.060 \n\nPrivate Car \nCNG Taxi \nMinibus \nMedium bus \nLarge bus \nSmall truck \nMedium truck \nLarge truck \nMotorcycle \nCNG  =  compressed  natural  gas,  hr  =  hour,  IRI  =  international  roughness  index,  km  =  kilometer,  vkm  = \nvehicle-kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nVOC Difference \n($/vkm) \n0.083 \n0.077 \n0.078 \n0.032 \n0.112 \n0.099 \n0.233 \n0.908 \n0.017 \n\nSpeed @ IRI 2 \n(km/hr) \n28 \n30 \n27 \n25 \n25 \n22 \n18 \n12 \n25 \n\nSpeed @ IRI \n8 (km/hr) \n20 \n22 \n20 \n18 \n18 \n15 \n10 \n5 \n20 \n\n10. \nDiverted  Traffic  Benefits.  The  objective  of  BRT  is  to  increase  the  modal  share  for \npublic  transport  vehicles.  By  definition,  any  increase  in  the  share  of  buses  will  decrease  the \nmodal  share  of  competing  passenger  transport  modes,  including  private  vehicles,  minibuses, \netc. The economic benefit associated with this diversion is reduced total VOC for these vehicles. \nThe  estimation  of  the  net  economic  benefit  associated  with  this  diversion  is  expressed  in \nvehicle-kilometers  for  each  type  of  vehicle  multiplied  by  VOC  savings  expressed  as  the \ndifference between the VOC for a large bus and the VOC for the mode from which the diversion \nis made. \n \nGenerated  Traffic  Benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  components  include  11  new  roads  with  a \n11. \ntotal  length  of  21.44  km.  New  roads  attract  new  residential  units,  commercial  establishments, \nwholesale  and  retail  businesses,  street  vendors,  and  other  types  of  economic  activity.  These \nactivities are attributable to the new roads, without which new commercial and residential units \nwould not be built. Based on the estimated traffic by vehicle type, the generated traffic benefits \nare  estimated  at  one-half  the  VOC  savings  used  for  normal  and  diverted  traffic.  Generated \ntraffic  benefits  are  assumed  to  materialize  gradually  over  4  years,  since  commercial  and \nresidential units along the new roads take time to develop. \n \n12. \nTime  Savings  Benefits.  Using  the  vehicle  operating  speeds  of  the  traffic  assignment \nmodel, total passenger-hours and freight ton-hours have been estimated for \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d assumptions. The difference between the two sets of estimated hours is the passenger \nand freight hours saved by the Project. The average annual income per capita in Anning in 2007 \nwas CNY9,787. Assuming a workforce participation ratio of 50% in Anning, the average annual \nincome per worker is CNY19,574. The time savings benefit for passengers has been estimated. \nThe value of worker leisure time and non-worker time is assumed to be zero. In this respect, the \npassenger time savings calculation is conservative. For freight time savings, the constant 2008 \nadjusted economic value per ton for six traded commodities (coal, fertilizer, crude oil, petroleum, \nsteel, and grains) was estimated at CNY2,763 per ton, and the opportunity cost of capital at 8% \nper annum was assumed. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n\nEconomic Evaluation, Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\nAvoided  Costs  and  Other  Benefits.  Two  categories  of  benefits  are  included  in  this \n13. \ncategory.  The  first  is  avoided  accident  costs.  Estimates  by  ADB  indicate  the  cost  of  road \naccidents in the People\u2019s Republic of China was on the order of $12.5 billion, or CNY98.7 billion, \nduring  2004.  This  estimate  includes  vehicle  and  property  damage,  medical  costs,  and  the \nestimated  loss  of  victims\u2019  earning  potential.  Accident  costs  have  been  expressed  in  terms  of \npassenger-kilometers  at  CNY0.068  per  passenger-kilometer  (PKM).  The  total  PKM  reduction \nunder the Project yields savings of 0.068/PKM in 2004, which is restated as CNY0.07667/PKM \nin  constant  2009  values.  Accident  costs  have  been  expressed  in  terms  of  PKM  at \nCNY0.07667/PKM  in  constant  2009  values.  The  shift  from  low-occupancy  vehicles  such  as \nprivate  vehicles  to  large  buses  as  a  result  of  the  Project  means  the  PKM  reductions  are \nmultiplied by the accident cost per PKM to estimate accident cost savings. \n \nThe  second  category  is  benefits  from  reduced  pollution.  The  Project  incorporates  a \n14. \nnumber of features to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by encouraging modal shifts \naway  from  private  vehicles  and  toward  public  transport.  The  carbon  emission  factors  for \nLanzhou\u2019s  compressed  natural  gas  vehicle  fleets  were  derived  from  fuel  efficiency  surveys  in \nLanzhou at compressed natural gas stations and as reported by the public transit organization. \nEmission  reductions  beyond  2012,  when  the  current  commitment  period  under  the  Kyoto \nProtocol expires, are now valued at approximately $10 per ton of CO2 reduced. There are more \npollution  reduction  benefits  attributable  to  the  Project  (carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen  oxides, \nhydrocarbons, and suspended particles), which have not been quantified in the benefits stream. \n \nC. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 17.02% (Table A13.2), with \n15. \nnet present value (NPV) at the annual discount rate of 12% amounting to CNY1.65 billion over \nthe  25-year  evaluation  period  from  2009  to  2033.  Benefits  from  VOC  savings  are  the  major \neconomic benefit (47.93%), followed by diverted traffic benefits (22.38%), time savings benefits \n(18.84%),  generated  traffic  benefits  (5.56%),  and  other  benefits  (5.27%).  Table  A13.3 \nsummarizes the results of selected sensitivity tests made on the data included in Table A13.2. A \n10%  increase  in costs  reduces  the  EIRR  to  15.72%,  and  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits reduces \nthe  EIRR  to  15.58%.  The  switching  value  for  costs  is  reached  at  +45.42%  and  for  benefits  at \n\u201331.23%.  Costs  for  resettlement  and  civil  works  carry  relatively  less  risk.  The  sensitivity  tests \nindicate that the NPV for these cost categories is positive within the plausible range of variability. \nA 1-year delay in project implementation reduces the EIRR to 15.25% and NPV by 37.54%. It is \nunlikely  that  any  risk  associated  with  cost  overruns  will  cause  an  EIRR of  less than  12%.  It  is \nequally  unlikely  that  any  risk  associated  with  reduced  project  benefits  would  make  the  Project \nunfeasible. \n \n16. \nA stochastic simulation of variability in key project parameters was made using @RISK \nsoftware. Project costs and benefits were assumed to change following a uniform distribution so \nthat  variability  in  parameter  estimates  will  have  an  equal  likelihood  of  occurrence.  Costs  were \nassumed to vary from \u201310% to +30% and benefits from \u201325% to +10%. Latin hypercube\u2013type \nrandom sampling was used, and the simulation ran to 500 iterations. The results show that in 16 \niterations (3.2%) the EIRR reached below 12% or NPV below zero. The results are robust, with \nminimal likelihood to make the Project unfeasible. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n56 \n \n\nTable A13.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2009 economic

Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\nProject Loan \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nTransport Division \n \n\nI.POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n \nThe Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project (the Project) includes urban road infrastructure that will support new \nurban development on the north side of the Yellow River. This will speed economic growth in this area, benefiting local \nresidents, including the poor. This Project is consistent with ADB's support for the Western Development Strategy as \nwell as economic stimulus through urban infrastructure development.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues. Only 5%\u201310% of the population of Anning is poor because it is located in the urban area of Lanzhou. \nThe main causes of poverty are unemployment and families with members who are disabled or have serious illnesses. \nThe Lanzhou municipal government (LMG) has social security policies to support these households. \n \nAnning  is  going  through  a  period  of  rapid  economic  growth  and  social  development.  It  was  already  the  cultural  and \neducational center of Lanzhou and, in 2004, was designated the new central business district and locus for LMG.  \n \nAnning  has  a  number  of  poverty  safeguards  established,  such  as  the  minimum  living  security  system,  medical \ninsurance system for minimum living security recipients, low-rent housing system for minimum income recipients, and \nurban-rural endowment insurance system. \n\nThe Project will benefit the poor but is not classified as a poverty intervention because the poor and others alike will \nhave access to and benefit from the various road and transport service developments.   \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The project design has stressed inclusive benefits for all people using the transport network in \nAnning.  Equal  attention has  been  given  to  vehicles,  non-motorized  vehicles,  and  pedestrians.  People in  Anning  rely \nheavily on bus transport, and the Project aims to strengthen bus mass transit in an affordable manner for all citizens. \nLMG provides lower fares for vulnerable groups and the elderly. Traffic management and road safety are features to \naddress  congestion  and  mixed  traffic  flows.  Special  consideration  has  been  provided  for  the  disabled.  These \nmeasures  and  design  features  are  set  out  in  the  Social  Development  Action  and  Monitoring  Plan  (SDAMP).  The \nresettlement plan includes exchange housing that ensures good-quality housing for low-income households. \n \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The benefits of the Project will be widespread among the urban districts of Lanzhou. However, the related \nurban  development  will  have  significant  benefits  for  urban  and  rural  residents  in  Anning.  The  beneficiaries  include \n(i)   road  users such  as  private  vehicle owners,  bus  passengers and  operators, bicycle owners,  and  pedestrians  and \n(ii)  public and private sector offices such as universities, government offices, commercial businesses, and industries.  \n \nNew  urban  roads  will  improve  connections  between  the  two  central  business  centers,  thereby  reducing  travel  times \nand  increasing  the  options  of  finding  employment  outside  of  Anning.  The  Project  will  attract  more  commercial, \nresidential, and industrial development to Anning, which will expand local employment opportunities. Rural residents \nthat  currently  leave  Anning  to  work  as  migrant  workers  in  other  districts  or  cities  will  find  expanded  employment \nopportunities close to home. \n \nThere are 2,750 disabled people in Anning, or 1.31% of the population. Disabled people are disproportionately poor in \nthe district, with 1,114 poor or especially needy people (40.5% of all disabled people). About 425 poor disabled people \nare currently on the minimum living security guarantee. LMG has policies, such as free bus service and blind paths, to \nprovide  the  disabled  with  better  mobility.  These  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  project  design.  Also,  the \nProject will assess the transport demands of disabled people and may promote minibus services for them.  \n \nThere are only 1,508 ethnic minority people in Anning, or 1.83% of the population.  Most of the ethnic minority people \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n58 \n \n\nin affected areas are Hui, who have a long tradition of successfully integrating with the majority Han population. The \ngovernment has provided preferential policies and programs for minorities. The Project will have no impacts on ethnic \nminorities. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\n \nCommunity  meetings  have  been  conducted  to  discuss  the  detailed  transport  and  related  urban  development  plans.  \nConsultation  with  communities  included  focus  group  meetings,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  informal  discussions \nduring  site  visits.  Focus  group  meetings  have  been  held  with  community  representatives,  municipal  agencies,  and \nhouseholds in selected subdistricts. Village meetings were conducted for resettlement planning. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing        \n\n    Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n\n No  \n\n  Yes    \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe project will encourage the participation of village and residential committees in transport planning, implementation, \nand  operation.  Resettlement  has  been  formulated  with  inputs  from  affected  communities,  and  a  resettlement \ninformation booklet has been provided to all affected people. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key  Issues.  The  Project  will enhance  the  urban  road  network  and  public  transit  system,  which  benefits  women \nand men equally. The mobility of women in Anning is already very high, and the Project will enhance the quality and \nfrequency of transportation services in a safer manner. Other than land acquisition and resettlement, the Project will \nnot cause any significant adverse social impacts on women. A livelihood training program will be provided for affected \npeople, and 50% of training will target women. Coupled with some of the training programs already set up by the All \nChina  Women\u2019s  Federation,  it  is  possible  that  women  will  benefit  more  in  terms  of  employment  and  economic \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures       \n\n   No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance \ntargets, monitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n\n \nThe SDAMP has been formulated to ensure more inclusive development benefits for women and vulnerable groups. \nThe specific actions and monitoring measures that will target and/or involve women in the design and implementation \nare summarized in the SDAMP. \n \nTo mitigate the impacts of land acquisition and resettlement, the All China Women\u2019s Federation will help ensure that \nwomen  are  fully  informed  and  participate  in  the  preparation  and  implementation of housing  relocation  and livelihood \nrestoration.

Based  on  the  impact  assessment,  the \nconstruction of the 11 proposed new urban roads totaling 21.55 km, and the construction of four \nresettlement sites, will involve the permanent acquisition or use of 122 hectares (ha) of land and \nthe  demolition  of  buildings  totaling  402,236  square  meters  (m2).  Twenty-five  villages  or \nresidential committees in seven subdistricts of Anning will be affected.  \n \nB. \n \nThe resettlement objective for unavoidably affected people is to achieve equal or better \n2. \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(2004), State Council Document No. 28, and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Any  people  losing  land,  housing,  other  assets,  or  income \nsources  will  be  assisted  to  fully  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.  According  to  the \npolicy and basic socioeconomic conditions of Anning, land compensation standards have been \nestablished based on 27\u201331 times the average annual output value.  \n \nFor  residents  affected  by  house  demolition,  the  main  compensation  package  includes \n3. \nreplacement with new apartments provided at 40 m2 per person with rural residential status and \n30  m2  per  person  with  urban  residential  status.  If  the  affected  households  prefer  cash \ncompensation,  double  replacement  value  (CNY1,298  per  m2)  will  be  paid  according  to  the \nstandard  40  m2  per  person  with  rural  residential  status  and  30  m2  per  person  with  urban \nresidential  status.  Cash  compensation  at  replacement  value  (i.e.,  CNY649  per  m2)  will  be \nprovided for the amount of the demolished housing larger than that of the replacement standard. \nOther  compensation  is  a  moving  allowance  of  CNY400  per  household  and  a  transition \nallowance of CNY150/person per month. Households that lose land and other seriously affected \nhouseholds  with  be  entitled  to  training  and  assistance  with  reemployment.  For  affected \nenterprises  and  institutions,  compensation  and  reconstruction  arrangements  will  be  made  as \nevaluated by qualified real estate appraisal companies and negotiated agreements.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nTo  implement  the  resettlement  plan  in  a  smooth  and  effective  manner,  a  resettlement \norganizational  network  from  higher  to  lower  governmental  levels  will  be  responsible  for  the \ndetailed planning, coordination, implementation, and monitoring of resettlement. Anning District \nResettlement  Leading  Group  and  Office  and  subdistrict  resettlement  groups  and  offices  have \nbeen  established  to  take  charge  of  land  requisition  and  resettlement.  Village  committees  will \nplay an active role to ensure community participation in resettlement planning, implementation, \nand monitoring. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nSome  of  the  affected  people  in  the  project  area  are  poor.  For  economically  vulnerable \npeople,  including  the  elderly  living  alone,  disabled,  households  headed  by  single  women,  and \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nVulnerable Groups \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n61 \n\n \n\nto \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress \n\npoverty  households,  the  Project  will  provide  additional  training  and  support.  The  affected \nhouseholds include those with current vulnerability as well as those facing severe impacts and \nrisks  caused  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  specific  type  of  assistance  will  be \ndetermined  according \ntheir  actual  condition  and  assessed  needs  during  detailed \nmeasurement surveys. The specific entitlements will be included in the household agreement. \n \nE. \n \nThe  Land  Law  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people.  Affected \n6. \nvillages have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan during meetings and \ninterviews.  Resettlement  information  will  be  disclosed  through  newspapers  to  all  affected \npeople. During detailed resettlement planning, there will be further notification and consultations \nto discuss specific impacts and how they will be addressed. Subdistrict and village officials will \nensure that any concerns raised by affected people are quickly addressed. In case of grievance, \nall  complaints  will  be  processed  according  to  Government  Regulation  Number  431  on \nGrievance  and  Redress.  People  can  submit  their  oral  or  written  complaint  first  to  the  village \ncommittee  or  township  resettlement  team.  If  their  complaint  is  not  settled  in  2  weeks,  the \naffected  person  can  seek  redress  at  the  county  resettlement  office  within  1  month.  If  still \nunresolved  within  2  weeks,  the  project  owner  will  try  to  achieve  a  solution  with  the  affected \nperson. The final redress would be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance with \nthe Civil Procedures Act. \n \nF. \n \nThe  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the \n7. \nresettlement  plan.  The  project  management  office  (PMO)  and  local  government  will  be \nresponsible  for  internal  monitoring  and  supervision  and  reporting  to  higher  government  levels \nand  ADB.  The  PMO  will  engage  a  qualified  domestic  monitor  to  carry  out  independent \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation. The monitor will ascertain whether affected people have \n(i)  received  their  full  entitlements  on  time  and  (ii)  fully  restored  their  livelihoods,  income,  and \nliving  standards.  The  monitor  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement,  semiannual \ninvestigations during resettlement, and annual survey updates for 2 years after the completion \nof  resettlement.  The  household  survey  will  include  a  representative  number  of  those  severely \naffected by loss of land, those losing housing, and those classified as economically vulnerable. \nThe monitor will provide ADB and the PMO with copies of the monitoring and evaluation reports \ntwice a year during resettlement implementation and once a year after resettlement completion.  \n \nG. \n \n8. \nThe resettlement budget estimate is CNY1,215 million, including compensation for land, \nhousing,  other  assets,  moving  allowances,  assistance  for  vulnerable  groups,  infrastructure, \nadministration, taxes, monitoring and evaluation, and contingencies. The PMO has guaranteed \nto  supplement  the  resettlement  budget  as  may  prove  necessary  to  meet  any  shortfall  that \nemerges in achieving the resettlement objectives.  \n\nResettlement Cost and Implementation Schedule \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n62 \n \n\nSERVICE QUALITY AND FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LANZHOU PUBLIC \nTRANSPORT GROUP \n \n\nBus Operation and Service Quality \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Lanzhou  Public  Transport  Group  (LPTG),  owned  by  the  Lanzhou  municipal \ngovernment (LMG), grew from an organization first established in 1953 and reorganized in 2003. \nLPTG operates adequate public transport services to the general public in Lanzhou. LPTG also \nowns hotels, five retail fuel stations, an advertising company, and other enterprises. However, as \nan  enterprise  owned  by  LMG,  LPTG's  primary  purpose  is  providing  affordable  and  efficient \npublic  transport  services  to  the  population  of  Lanzhou.  As  such,  the  profit-making  motive \ncommon in private sector companies is given less emphasis in LPTG's business strategy. \n\n2. \nLPTG  possesses  2,089  buses  that  were  4.5  years  old  on  average  in  2009.  The  buses \nhave 30\u201340 seats and a passenger capacity of 60\u201370. LPTG operates 92 bus routes with a total \nlength of 1,076 kilometers (km) in Lanzhou. The number of passenger trips in 2004 was 346.8 \nmillion, increasing to 540.0 million in 2008. \n\n3. \nIndividual private bus operators were operating 99 minibuses on 15 routes without fixed \nbus stops in Lanzhou as of July 2009. These minibuses have capacity for 20 passengers. There \nwere  305  minibuses  owned  by  individual  bus  operators  in  2007,  but  LMG  bought  up  the \nindividual bus companies to consolidate them under LPTG.  \n\nBus Fares and Integrated Circuit Cards \n\n1. \n \n4. \nLanzhou  Pricing  Bureau  sets  the  bus  fare,  which  is  currently  CNY1  regardless  of \ndistance.  The  company  does  not  provide  a  discount  for  the  elderly,  the  disabled,  students,  or \nany  other  groups.  In  2000,  LPTG  started  implementing  the  integrated  circuit  card  system  on \nselected  routes.  By  2006,  some  76  LPTG  routes  were  equipped  with  integrated  circuit  card \nequipment. Today all routes and buses are equipped with the integrated circuit card system. The \nintegrated  circuit  card  is  a  magnetically  coded  card  that  contains  records  of  the  purchaser\u2019s \nidentification,  date  of  issue,  type  of  card,  ridership  data  as  the  card  is  used  by  the  passenger \n(read by the on-bus magnetic card reader), and remaining balance. A security deposit of CNY18 \ncollected from the passenger when the card is issued is refundable when the card is returned. \nThe  integrated  circuit  card  is  a  prepaid  card  that  users  can  recharge  at  16  outlets  at  bus \nterminals  and  large  shopping  centers.  Approximately  1.5  million  integrated  circuit  cards  are \ncurrently issued. \n\n5. \nThe integrated circuit card designates the fare class for the passenger and has made it \npossible to introduce a user-oriented fare structure. The A class card is considered the regular \nclass, with a discount of 15% from the cash fare of CNY1. The B class card is issued to current \nand former state-owned enterprise and government employees with a discount of 25% from the \ncash fare. The C class card is issued to students in elementary to high school with a discount of \n60%, and the D class card carrying a discount of 50% is issued to the unemployed and senior \npassengers.  The  E  class  card  provides  free  transport  to  disabled  military  and  severely \nhandicapped non-military passengers. A and B class cards are not checked for validity, but the \nother  class  cards  are  checked  annually.  Currently  about  55%  of  bus  fares  are  paid  using \nintegrated circuit cards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n63 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nCustomer Satisfaction \n\n6. \nAccording to LPTG officials, the bus company\u2019s service and vehicle quality is better than \nthe  average  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  LPTG  has  implemented  its  own  customer \nsatisfaction surveys for vehicle and service quality since 2003. A questionnaire was designed for \nthis purpose with questions covering such areas as waiting time at stations for bus arrival; on-\ntime  departure  and  arrival;  staff  behavior,  appearance,  and  courtesy;  vehicle  cleanliness; \ndisruptive  passenger  behavior  such  as  smoking,  eating,  using  abusive  language,  and  talking \nloudly;  driver  adherence  to  traffic  signs,  rules,  and  safety;  and  the  working  condition  of  doors, \nintegrated  circuit  card  readers,  and  other  equipment  on  the  bus.  The  company  recruits  100 \npassengers  annually,  paying  each  CNY480  per  year  to  report  on  15  routes  per  month  with \nnumerical grades for each question, thereby evaluating 18,000 trips per year.  \n\nOperating Statistics and Productivity \n\n3. \n \n7. \nDuring  the  5-year  period  from  2004  to  2008,  the  total  route  length  increased  by  0.6% \nannually, from 1,056 km to 1,076 km. The number of LPTG bus routes meanwhile fell from 100 \nto 92 (by 2.1% per year). When the average annual increase of 11.7% in ridership is considered \nfor  the  same  period,  it  is  evident  that  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  routes  has  consolidated \nservice  with  higher  efficiency  in  equipment  and  employee  productivity.  For  example,  average \nannual  revenue  per  bus  increased  from  CNY132,650  in  2004  to  CNY210,950  in  2008,  for  a \n12.3% increase annually; average revenue per passenger increased from CNY0.76 to CNY0.81, \nor 1.6% annually; and average annual passenger trips per employee increased from 48,030 to \n70,710 in 2008, increasing by 10.2% per year.  \n\n8. \nIt  is  projected  that,  during  the  10  years  from  2009  to  2018,  the  total  route  length  will \nincrease  by  0.8%  annually,  from  1,089  km  in  2009  to  1,168  km  in  2018.  The  number  of  bus \nroutes  is  expected to  increase from  92  to  96  as  new  routes  will  be  added for the  planned  the \nnew  city  center,  new  residential  and  commercial  areas,  and  BRT.  Employee  productivity  is \nexpected  to  gradually  increase  from  3.66  staffers  per  bus  in  2009  to  3.34  staffers  per  bus  in \n2018, and the average number of passenger trips per employee from 74,950 in 2009 to 119,630 \nin 2018. The number of buses in operation is expected to increase from 2,089 in 2009 to 4,495 \nin 2018, while the revenue per passenger is forecast to increase at the same rate of 1.6% per \nannum as in the 2004\u20132008 period.  \n\n9. \nIn general, LPTC bus operations indicate an efficiently run operation with relatively high \nemployee  productivity,  though  with  some  room  for  improvement.  With  increasing  demand  for \npublic passenger transport, additional buses will be needed since fleet utilization is now running \nat  261,630  passengers  per  bus  annually.  Even  with  doubling  the  fleet  size,  productivity  is \nexpected to increase by 52.8% to 399,830 passengers per bus by 2018. \n\nFinancial Assessment \n\nB. \n \n10. \nThe  audited  financial  statements  of  LPTG  for  2004\u20132008  have  been  analyzed.  They \ninclude the income statement and cash flow statement for the year and the balance sheet as of \nthe end of the year. The company\u2019s fiscal year coincides with the calendar year.  \n\n11. \nThe  LPTG  bus  division  shows  a  consistently  positive  net  operating  profit,  ranging  from \nCNY56.75  million  in  2004  (22.3%  of  revenue)  to  CNY63.26  million  in  2008  (15%  of  revenue) \nwith the operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) ranging from 73.0% \nin 2006 to 85.0% in 2008. The working capital ratio (which deducts depreciation from operating \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n64 \n \n\nexpenses) ranged from 64.3% in 2006 to 78.1% in 2008, and this also shows strong operating \nperformance by the bus division.  \n\n12.  When administrative overhead and other non-operating expenses are included, the bus \ndivision\u2019s profitability shows mixed results, with 2004, 2005, and 2008 showing a net loss before \ntax  and  2006  and  2007  showing  a  modest  profit.  Despite  its  emphasis  on  public  service, \nhowever, during the 5 years from 2004 to 2008, the cumulative losses for the bus division are \nmore than offset by the cumulative profits, for a total accumulated profit before tax of CNY25.61 \nmillion, or an average of CNY5.12 million per year. \n\n13. \nThe financial condition of LPTG would be improved if losses from non-bus divisions were \neliminated through divestiture or if the accounting and financial records of the bus division were \nseparated from the other divisions. The hotel division in particular fails to show a profit, and its \ninclusion as a division of LPTG, which is primarily a bus transport company, is a burden on the \nprofitability of its primary operations.  \n\nLPTG\u2019s historical current ratio ranged from 0.64 in 2005 to 1.34 in 2008. These ratios are \n14. \nlow  and  reflect  liquidity  problems  in  some  years,  particularly  when  the  quick  ratio  has  fallen \nbelow 1.0, which happened in 4 of the past 5 years. The debt-to-equity ratio during the past 5 \nyears  averaged  1.05,  showing  rough  parity  between  equity  and  liabilities.  Although  this  ratio \ncould  be  a  concern  in  relation  to  the  ability  of  LPTG  to  borrow  further  on  the  strength  of  its \nbalance sheet, about 65% of the company\u2019s debt is to its parent, LMG, in the form of long-term \nliability  resulting  from  accounting  adjustments  arising  with  ownership  reform  initiated  prior  to \n2004. This long-term debt could be written off to improve the debt-to-equity ratio substantially. \n\n15. \nDuring  the  next  4  years,  from  2009  to  2012,  LPTG  operations  are  expected  to  bring \ncumulative  losses  before  tax  of  CNY52.0  million,  or  an  average  of  CNY13.0  million  annually. \nThese  expected  losses  do  not  result  from  the  bus  division,  which  is  expected  to  realize  a \ncumulative  net  profit  before  tax  of  CNY92.0  million  during  the  same  period,  or  an  average  of \nCNY23.0 million year. With the commencement of BRT services in 2013, the bus division\u2019s profit \nbefore  tax  is  projected  to  increase.  After  2013,  largely  because  of  BRT  operations,  the  bus \ndivision\u2019s profit before tax is expected to offset the losses of the other divisions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 November 2009) \n \nyuan (CNY) \n$0.1465 \nCNY6.827 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", " \n \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Currency Unit \nCNY1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ADB \nBOC \nBRT \nCDM \nCDM EB \nCMI \nCER \nCO2 \nEA \nEIA \nEIRR \n11FYP \nGDP \nGHG \nGPG \nICB \nIRI \nITS \nLMFLUO \nLMG \nLPTG \nLRT \nNCB \nNMT \nNPV \nPMO \nPRC \nPSC \nSDAMP \nTDM \nTSF \nUNFCCC \nVOC \n", "g \nha \nhr \nkm \nkm2 \nkm/h \nm \nm2 \nPKM \npphpd \nvkm \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBank of China \nbus rapid transit \nClean Development Mechanism \nClean Development Mechanism executive board \nCarbon Market Initiative \ncertified emission reduction \ncarbon dioxide \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \n11th Five-Year Plan \ngross domestic product \ngreenhouse gas  \nGansu provincial government \ninternational competitive bidding \ninternational roughness index \nintelligent transport system \nLanzhou Municipal Foreign Loan Utilization Office \nLanzhou municipal government \nLanzhou Public Transport Group \nlight rail transit \nnational competitive bidding \nnon-motorized transport \nnet present value \nproject management office \nPeople's Republic of China \nproject steering committee \nsocial development action and monitoring plan \ntraffic demand management \ntechnical support facility \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nvehicle operating cost \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gram \nhectare \nhour \nkilometer \nsquare kilometer \nkilometer per hour \nmeter \nsquare meter \npassenger-kilometer \npassengers per hour per direction \nvehicle-kilometer \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars  \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
