THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Internet-Plus Agriculture Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will promote social and economic inclusion and sustainable livelihoods of poor \npeople and vulnerable groups by providing an agriculture service system, information technology for \nvalue chains, and information support to areas where rural poverty is still endemic. The main \nbeneficiaries of the project will be members of cooperatives, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nand contracted farmers in the seven prefectures that comprise the project area: Baiyin, Dingxi, \nJiuquan, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Wuwei, and Zhangye. The project will include design features to ensure \nthat farmers have access to high-value e-commerce markets and thereby increase their income. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged behind industrial production and \nurban livelihoods in the PRC. As a result, income inequality and poverty persist in rural areas of \nlesser-developed  regions  of  the  PRC.  Increasing  productivity  and  value  addition  through \nmodernization and enhanced market linkages has considerable poverty reduction potential in the \nPRC, where agriculture labor still accounts for more than 25% of total employment. Against this \nbackdrop, the Government of the PRC formulated the rural vitalization strategy for 2018\u20132022 to \npromote  poverty  reduction,  rural  development, and  green  and  inclusive  growth.1  The  rural \nvitalization strategy focuses on modernizing agriculture with the application of information and \ncommunication technology (ICT), which is intended to increase agricultural productivity, reduce \nfood safety risks, and cut pollution from fertilizers and pesticides. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach to strategically program \nADB\u2019s lending support for rural vitalization development initiatives. \n \n4.  Internet-plus  agriculture  refers  to  the  application  of  network-connected  information \ntechnology along the entire value chain from production to marketing. This enhances market \naccess through a two-way automated information exchange system between producers and \nconsumers. It provides consumers with product information while producers get access to market \ninformation and production support services. Internet-plus has shown great potential to increase \nincome in rural areas through (i) stabilized demand via access to e-commerce, and (ii) reduced \nproduction costs from avoided food losses along the value chain as a result of expanded smart \nstorage  and  processing  capacity. This  project will  demonstrate  the  application  of  network-\nconnected sensors and tracing technologies to provide product quality and safety information to \nconsumers and to enhance market access and technical support for farmers. \n \n5.  Gansu province, in the northwest of the PRC, is the seventh-largest province in the PRC \nwith a population of 26.20 million, of which 14.44 million (55.1%) live in rural areas.2 In 2016, \nGansu\u2019s total gross domestic product was CNY720 billion, of which agriculture accounted for \n13.7%. In 2017, Gansu\u2019s gross domestic product per capita of CNY29,326 (equivalent to about \n                                                \n1  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State \nCouncil. 2018.

Beijing.  \n \n ", "2 \n$4,417)3 was the lowest of all provinces in the PRC, and 50% of the province\u2019s 87 counties are \ndesignated as national poverty counties. In the proposed project prefectures, 6.5%\u201310.5% of the \nrural population live below the national annual income poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita.4  \n \n6.  Information asymmetry about product quality and safety characteristics (e.g., origin of \ninputs, farming system, food safety, nutrition values) has led to selection of low-value products, \nwhich compromises traceability, food safety, and competitiveness in developing high-value online \nand offline markets in Gansu and other provinces. The project design contains innovative \nagriculture internet-plus features, which aims to achieve global public goods, such as enhanced \nfood  safety  and  reduced  environmental  pollution.  ICT-supported  value  chain  services  for \ntraceability and food safety will provide an opportunity for farmers to access high-value e-\ncommerce markets through the network of relevant business entities (e.g., traders, logistics \nservices, wholesalers, and retailers).  \n \n7.  Uncoordinated business relationships between the primary and processing segments \ndominate the agriculture sector. Farmers\u2019 decisions on the quality and quantity of applied water, \nfertilizers, and pesticides for crop growth are not documented or optimized through the application \nof  modern  precision  technology.  Real-time  information  services  on  specific  agro-ecological \nconditions, such as soil fertility, moisture, and temperature, are missing. Excessive application of \nwater, fertilizers, and pesticides are common inefficient input uses in crop production, resulting in \nhigh production costs, nonpoint source pollution, food safety risks, and inefficient water usage. \nBusiness upscaling of processing operations through contract farming arrangements to realize \neconomies of scale is constrained by high sourcing costs for inputs because of high transaction \ncosts with small-scale entities. Many processing operations lack adequate coordination of storage \nfacilities, transportation, and marketing capacity which would enable them to produce the volume \nand quality needed to access premium e-commerce and offline markets. \n \n8.  Limited ICT capacity of farmers, processors, and other service providers is constraining the \nadoption of integrated and automated information exchange systems, which could facilitate the \ncoordination and cooperation between business entities in the production and marketing segments. \nLimited technology application capacity of farmer cooperatives hampers access to high-value e-\ncommerce markets and adoption of modern production methods. The primary production segment \nis characterized by scattered unorganized production of small-scale farmers with low bargaining \npower and low-value crop production. Although the Gansu Supply and Marketing Cooperatives \nUnion (GSSMCU) is providing agro-technology advice to farmers, the high demand for product-\nspecific support services to enable access to ICT-supported e-commerce markets is largely unmet. \n \n9.  Government policy. Improving rural livelihoods, and particularly eradicating extreme \npoverty by 2020, is a key priority under the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National \nEconomic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.5 The PRC has initiated internet-plus policies with \nthe objective of integrating the agriculture sector into the wider economy through the use of ICT \nsolutions to link rural economic development approaches to service delivery in rural areas. The \ngovernment is committed to eradicating poverty and closing the income gap that exists between \nurban and rural populations. E-commerce and internet-based support services are accelerating \n                                                \n3  Based on an average 2016 exchange rate of $1.00 = CNY6.64. \n4  Project interventions are planned in Baiyin, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Wuwei, and Zhangye prefectures with some project \nactivities also in Dingxi and Jiuquan prefectures. \n5  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

Strategic fit. The project will support ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by creating knowledge and \npromoting rural development and food security.6 Supporting inclusive economic growth is a key \nstrategic priority for ADB in its country partnership strategy for the PRC.7 The Gansu Provincial \nGovernment (GPG) requested ADB assistance in implementing the PRC\u2019s focus on an internet-\nplus approach to promoting agriculture-based industry for local specialty agricultural products. This \nproject supports the improvement of market connectivity and value-chain linkages, which is one of \nthe four priority areas of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources.8 Support \nto rural development, through agricultural modernization and value chain promotion approaches, is \none of the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC (footnote 7). \n \n11.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous and ongoing projects \nfinanced  by  ADB  and  others  in  the  PRC.9  The  lessons  include  (i)  enabling  farmers  and \nagribusiness  companies  to finance  longer-term  investment to  increase  production,  improve \nproductivity,  enhance  value  addition,  and  access  new  markets;  (ii)  engaging  agribusiness \ncompanies to create income-generating opportunities; (iii) helping farmers improve access to \nmarkets and improve product quality control through cooperation with agribusiness companies; \nand (iv) engaging agribusiness companies to involve farmers and cooperatives for improved \nproduction enterprises and equitable benefit sharing. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) inclusive economic opportunities in \nthe rural areas of Gansu province increased, and (ii) poverty in rural areas of Gansu province \nreduced.10 The project will have the following outcome: income-generating opportunities from \nagricultural production and marketing increased.11 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Comprehensive information service and management platform developed. \nThis output will develop data centers with information platforms to process data generated from \nproject facilities established under output 2 for increased production and processing efficiency and \nfor e-commerce marketing purposes. This will include (i) constructing data and training centers, (ii) \nprocuring ICT equipment and technical advisory services, and (iii) training farmers and enterprise \nstaff to build capacity in ICT application in the agriculture production and processing segment. The \nplatform will provide product origin, quality, safety monitoring, and tracing services as well as \nmanagement advice for the coordination and optimization of agricultural production, processing, \nand marketing activities. The integrated network will also reduce transaction costs between service \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2018.

The \nplatform is intended to be scalable and inclusive to provide project-generated market information, \nand agricultural support services to a wide range of beneficiaries, especially farmers who lack \naccess to markets and high-quality technical support services.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Agricultural production, processing, storage, and marketing modernized. \nThis output will (i) establish demonstration agricultural production enterprises for high-value crop \nproduction  including  summer  vegetables,  potatoes,  fruits,  and  licorice;  and  forage  crop \nproduction, in particular mulberry plants;12 (ii) equip the demonstration enterprises with internet-\nof-things (IOT)13 applications for product quality and safety monitoring and increased production \nefficiency,  and  coordination  with  other  segments  of  the  agriculture  sector;  (iii)  construct \nwarehouses, cold storage facilities, and market facilities to increase value addition; and (iv) \nfinance ICT  and transport  equipment  to  promote  an  integrated  and  automated  information \nexchange network for enhanced coordination and quality assurance at distribution, storage, \nprocessing, and marketing facilities. Global positioning systems together with network-connected \nsensors for soil moisture, temperature, and optical spectrum will be utilized to monitor and \noptimize the quantity and timing of irrigation, fertilizer application, and harvesting depending on \nthe intrafield variability of crops and soil conditions. Project-financed improvements to processing \nand storage services facilities will benefit small farmers including women and vulnerable groups \nthrough enhanced market access. The production enterprises will be used for demonstration and \ntraining purposes to increase access and quality of agriculture technology and management \nsupport services for small farmers, including women and vulnerable groups in rural areas, who \nwill benefit as suppliers or members of the cooperatives.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Capacity of Gansu Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Union improved. \nThis  output  will  (i)  provide  project-related  training,  including  on  IOT,  to  GSSMCU,  project \nimplementation unit (PIU), and other related government agency staff in implementing the project; \n(ii) support study tours, in particular with respect to precision agriculture, modern internet-based \nmarketing, quality control, and traceability; and (iii) promote participation in capacity building and \nknowledge sharing events. The output will improve the capacity of GSSMCU staff to implement \nprojects and to work within an internet-based working environment. \n \n16.  Innovations. IOT tracing sensors will be installed along production and processing lines \nso as to allow the identification of product batches. This will provide credible product origin and \nfood safety certification data on branded fresh and processed agricultural products. Greenhouses \nand agriculture production bases for high-value crops will be equipped with temperature, soil \nfertility and moisture sensors to optimize fertilizer and water application. Depending on the \nintrafield soil and crop variability, both production costs and environmental pollution will be cut. \nProject platforms will provide tailored agriculture precision farming and value chain services \nthough IOT applications. Production batch identification technology will also be installed in \nwarehouses and logistics fleets to achieve higher cost-effectiveness of the distribution system \nand online delivery linkages to e-commerce platforms. The project investment in value chain \nservices will enable farmers to access e-commerce and is envisaged to act as a catalyst to attract \nlarge-scale private sector activities for value chain services related to e-commerce in this poor \nprovince. \n                                                \n12 Participating enterprises were selected with regard to their potential to increase rural incomes and promoting the \napplication of internet-plus technologies. Details on the selection process and selected enterprises\u2019 existing business \nmodels are available in Appendix 3 of the project administration manual and the linked document Financial Analysis. \n13  The IOT refers to physical devices embedded with sensors and network connection capability that enable these devices \nto collect and exchange data. It allows remote sensing and control of devices through existing internet infrastructure.  \n \n ", "5 \n17.  Knowledge sharing. ADB has published the project preparation lessons in a technical \nreport.14 The project\u2019s innovative organization of the internet-plus agriculture concept and the \nbusiness models regarding integrating e-commerce solutions offer a unique opportunity to showcase \nvalue-added modern agriculture practices to other developing member countries and with other \nprovinces of the PRC. In this context, the project team will liaise with the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC), CAREC Institute, and the Greater Mekong Subregion platforms to \ndisseminate the best practices by participating in regional events and organizing CAREC-led study \ntours to the project area. Further, in close coordination with the ADB-PRC Regional Knowledge \nSharing Initiative, regional dissemination of the innovative solutions will be undertaken. \n \nD.

The economic analysis indicated that the overall project is economically viable, with an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 20.4% and an economic net present value of CNY1.2 \nbillion. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of output 1 with an EIRR of 17.2% and \noutput 2 with an EIRR of 21.8%, and of the seven subprojects. Sensitivity analysis indicated that \nthe project is robust to negative scenarios examined, such as an increase in investment costs, \nreduction of benefits, and increase in operation and maintenance cost. The financial analysis \nincluded financial evaluations of the subprojects and financial statements analyses of the PIUs to \ndetermine the financial viability and financial sustainability of all the subprojects. The financial \nevaluations reveal that the financial internal rate of return of each subproject exceeds the weighted \ncost of capital, indicating that the overall project is financially viable. Sensitivity analysis indicated \nthat  the  project remains financially  viable  when  it  is  influenced  by  adverse  changes  in key \nquantifiable variables. The financial statements analyses demonstrate that the PIUs have adequate \nfinancial capacity to cover the incremental recurrent costs for operation and maintenance for all the \nsubprojects. The project is considered financially sustainable.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nGuidance Note for Financial Management Assessment.17 The financial management assessment \nassessed the financial management capacity of the GSSMCU, the project implementing agency, \nand the seven PIUs. The assessment confirmed that the project implementing agency and all the \nPIUs have adequate financial management systems and procedures in place to implement the \nproject  efficiently.  The  financial  management  risk  is  rated  moderate.  Given  that  the  project \nimplementing agency and the seven subproject implementing units are less familiar with ADB loan \nproceeds disbursement requirements and procedures, training activities will be required to further \nimprove project implementation efficiency. The procurement risk assessment confirmed that the \nimplementing agency, which will manage and monitor all procurements conducted by PIUs through \na  procurement  agency,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  and  the  consultants,  have  adequate \nprocurement capacity to facilitate full compliance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended) was explained to and \n                                                \n17  ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n ", "8 \ndiscussed with the GSSMCU and PIUs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Poverty and social. ADB prepared the poverty and social analysis based on intensive \nstakeholder consultations and socioeconomic surveys. It indicated that the project will provide \nopportunities for inclusive social development and poverty reduction in the project area. The \nproject will (i) support a cumulative total of 2,397 full-time and 13,992 part-time local jobs, (ii) \ninvolve 12,866 farmer households for contract farming, and (iii) benefit 110,000 rural households \nin  the  project  counties  as  internet-based  service  platform  users.  Among  the  beneficiary \nhouseholds, 30% are poor and low-income households that will benefit from local employment \nand other socioeconomic opportunities. The farmers will benefit from working or cooperating with \nagricultural enterprises or PIUs as their employees, contractual farmers, land lessors, and users \nof services supported during implementation and operation of the project. In addition, the project \nservices will also benefit 8,500 entities that include enterprises, cooperatives, and supply and \nmarketing cooperatives in the counties and towns. ADB prepared a social development action \nplan based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific targets for the poor and low-income \npeople. ADB conducted consultations with the farmers and stakeholders during the project \npreparation  and  included  in  the  PAM  a  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  the  project \nimplementation stage.  \n \n28.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women are involved in \nagricultural and household work, and most are primarily engaged in labor-intensive farming and \nhave  low  incomes.  Women  have  less  knowledge  of  agricultural  technology,  fewer  job \nopportunities, and much lower involvement in decision making than men. The project is expected \nto benefit women significantly, as the majority of the employment and training opportunities will \nbe provided to women. ADB prepared a gender action plan (GAP) based on gender analyses to \nensure that the project contributes to improved gender equality.18 The GAP includes the following \nkey measures and targets for women: (i) 10,000 women trained to access project information, \nagricultural inputs, and other online services; (ii) 30 female specialists included in the technical \nteams; (iii) a total of 10,456 employment opportunities made available for women by the project \nenterprises; (iv) capacity building and training for 10,456 women conducted on employment and \nlabor skills; (v) consultation facilitated with women in contract farming and land leasing (50% \nwomen); (vi) women\u2019s involvement ensured in consultation and participation for implementation \nof project\u2019s social aspects (50% women); and (vii) sex-disaggregated data collected for monitoring \nthe GAP and other relevant measures. ADB also included key gender targets in the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). The project team prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP), and it follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n                                                \n18  Details are in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n ", "9 \nPolicy Statement.20 The project team will base the IEE and EMP on the approved domestic \nfeasibility study and environmental assessment reports, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. \nConsultations included affected people and local government agencies, and the outcomes have \nbeen integrated in the project design. The draft IEE was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The GPG, \nthrough the project management office, will be responsible for implementation and compliance with \nthe EMP, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. \nThe implementing agencies have no prior experience of ADB safeguard procedures, and loan \nimplementation consultants and a capacity building program are included in the project design. \n \n31.  The  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  environmental  improvement,  including  (i) \nconserved water resources through improved farming efficiency, soil moisture monitoring, and \ncrop selection; and (ii) reduced pollution of soil and water through efficient use of agricultural \nchemicals. Construction risks include short-term impacts such as noise and dust. Operational \nrisks include the unsustainable use of water resources and increased use of fertilizers and \npesticides. Water balance assessments have confirmed that the project water use is within the \ncapacity of sources. Mitigation measures are described in the EMP. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project does not involve involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The PIUs will use 5,114.5 mu of state-owned land for the \nconstruction of agricultural processing or logistics facilities.21  \n \n33.  Land leasing. For agriculture production purposes, the PIUs will use collective-owned \nland leased through the voluntary land use right transfer (LURT) process. The LURT process is \na land leasing arrangement and will not change the ownership of collective-owned land. PIUs will \nuse a total of 66,240.4 mu of collective lands (41,380.4 mu leased already and 24,860.0 mu to be \nleased). The land use arrangements for existing or already leased lands were reviewed for due \ndiligence during the transaction technical assistance implementation and it was concluded that \nthe LURT agreements were conducted in a voluntary, transparent, and fair manner and that \nrelevant principles of voluntary land leases had been followed.22 For the LURT agreements that \nwill be finalized after the project approval, an LURT framework has been prepared providing \nnecessary  guidance  on  principles  and  procedures  to  be  followed  during  the  project \nimplementation.  With  the  help  of  loan  implementation  consultants,  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies will internally monitor the implementation of the LURT framework and land \nleases, resolve any issues related to LURT, and report findings through periodic progress reports \nduring project implementation. An external social monitoring expert, who will be financed under \nADB loan, will externally monitor land leases and submit annual monitoring reports during the \nproject implementation. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not impact any distinct and vulnerable \nethnic minority communities that would trigger requirements on indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35.  Capacity for implementation and monitoring of social and gender measures. The \nGPG has experience in implementing ADB projects, including an ADB-financed agriculture \n                                                \n20 ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) is available both in English and Chinese (http://www.adb.org/ \nDocuments/Policies/Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf and http://www.adb.org/Documents/ \nTranslations/Chinese/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-cn.pdf)  \n21  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters or 0.067 hectares). \n22 The LURT principles include that agreements follow legal procedures; contracting parties are informed and consulted; \nagreements are voluntary; farmers or lessors benefit from lease payment and other benefits, such as employment; \nand the lessors will not be adversely impacted. The same principles will also apply to house renting. \n ", "10 \nproject. However, the GSSMCU and PIUs do not have experience in implementing ADB projects. \nTo implement social and gender measures properly, (i) the GSSMCU and the PIUs will appoint a \nsocial and gender focal person; and (ii) the loan implementation consultant will include a social \nand gender consultant to provide training and capacity building to the focal staff for implementing, \nmonitoring, and reporting social and gender measures including the GAP, social development \naction plan, and LURT framework.  \n \nF.
