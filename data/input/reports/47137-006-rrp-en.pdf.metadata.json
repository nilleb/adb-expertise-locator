Subprogram 1 supported the 7th HSDP (2011\u20132015),4 while subprogram 2 aligns with \nthe 8th HSDP (2016\u20132020).5 Policy actions under both subprograms target health sector reform \n(HSR)  processes,  health  care  access  for  vulnerable  groups,  quality  improvement  of  health \npersonnel, and sound public financial management. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nEquitable  and \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \ninclusive  growth.  The  8th  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (NSEDP) (2016\u20132020) aims for the Lao PDR to graduate from least-developed \ncountry  status  by  2020, and  become  an  upper middle-income country  by  2030.6  Forecasts for \n2017 indicate that the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.8%, resulting in GDP per \ncapita of $2,579, and its poverty rate fell to 20.0%.7 Significant development challenges remain, \nhowever, including (i) a high fiscal deficit, (ii) accumulated public and publicly guaranteed debt, \nand  (iii)  an  undiversified  resource-based  economy.  The  government  recognizes  that  equitable \nand inclusive growth requires targeted policy interventions for vulnerable groups, and the NSEDP \ncommits sustained investment to improve access to and the quality of basic social services such \nas health care, with a view to improving health outcomes, especially for the poor, women, and \nchildren. Better health of the workforce results in lower absenteeism, higher labor productivity, \nand increased wages, all of which contribute to economic growth. Such effects are particularly \nimportant in countries where many are engaged in unskilled labor.8 \n \nUnfulfilled  health  targets.  The  Lao  PDR  has  made  good  progress  in  achieving  many \n4. \nhealth  targets:9  (i)  life  expectancy  in  2015  was  68  years,  and  (ii)  the  maternal  mortality  ratio \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Health (MOH). 2013.

Communicable diseases \nsuch  as  HIV,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  are  prevalent.13  The  incidence  of  noncommunicable \ndiseases,  accidents,  and  injuries  remains  significant  as  well;  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)  reported  that  noncommunicable  diseases  constituted  60%  of  the  burden  of  disease  in \n2008, while accidents and injuries accounted for 10%.14  \n \n5. \nLimited utilization of health care services. Poor health outcomes are closely linked to \nthe limited use of health services. The overall use of public health services is reported to have \nincreased fivefold during 2000\u20132013 to about 0.6 visits per person per year (footnote 12), but this \nis  still  low  and  gaps  in  coverage  remain  between  the  poor  and  rich,  and  rural  and  non-rural \npopulations, especially for MNCH services, including immunization, antenatal care, skilled birth \nattendance, and surgery. Children in the poorest quintile are 3.6 times more likely to die before \nreaching age 5 compared with those in the wealthiest quintile, and children born in Phongsaly \nprovince are five times more likely to die before reaching age 5 than those born in Vientiane.15 \n \n6. \nThe  proposed  policy-based  grant\u2014which  is  contingent  on  the  achievement  of  policy \nactions,  including  robust  policies  and  strategies  for  health  and  finance\u2014can  alleviate  some  of \nthese macroeconomic  and  health  burdens.16 The program targets four  critical  areas  of  reform: \nimproving HSR processes; improving implementation of free health care for the poor, mothers, \nand children; strengthening human resource management capacity; and strengthening the health \nsector\u2019s financial management system. \n \n7. \nImproving  health  sector  reform  processes.  Three  critical  issues  impede  smooth \nimplementation of HSR. First, no governing body manages and plans HSR, in part because of a \nlack  of  competent  managers  with  adequate  leadership  skills  at  central,  provincial,  and  district \nlevels and across Ministry of Health (MOH) departments. This affects MOH\u2019s ability to advocate \nfor  HSR  and  its related plans  at  the  broader  policy  level  and  to  respond quickly  to  new  policy \nchallenges.  Second,  although  health  sector  coordination\u2014across  ministries,  departments,  and \ndevelopment partners\u2014has improved, fragmentation, duplication, and misalignment remain. This \nis in part because of a lack of direction or planning for key areas, such as health financing and \nhuman resources, which can result in limited resources being used inefficiently. Third, progress \nunder the government\u2019s decentralization program has been incremental and inconsistent because \n\n                                                 \n10 Government of the Lao PDR, MOH. 2016.

Relatively low government spending on \n8. \nhealth is reflected in high private out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, making health care unaffordable \nfor  many.  The  government  is  seeking  to  reduce  OOP  payments  from  45.1%  of  total  health \nexpenditure  in  FY2016  to  30%  by  2025.19  The  government  has  subsidized  specific  groups \n(including the poor, mothers, and children) through programs such as health equity funds (HEFs) \nand free maternal, newborn, and child health care (FMNCH). The Lao PDR shifted to a national, \npredominantly prepaid financing mechanism in 2015, however, and introduced National Health \nInsurance  (NHI).  NHI  drastically  increased  population  coverage,  enlarged  the  risk  pool,  and \nreduced  fragmentation  between  different  schemes,  beginning  with  the  absorption  of  HEF  and \nFMNCH. The government has also rapidly mobilized resources through an earmarked NHI fund \nadministered  by  the  National  Health  Insurance  Bureau  (NHIB).20  NHI  has  empowered  people \nthrough  simplified  rules  to  access  health  benefits  and  increased  predictability  of  health  care \nfinancing.  Once  enrolled  and  upon  payment  of  a  fixed  co-payment  at  a  facility,  patients  are \ncovered for a range of benefits, including all inpatient and outpatient services and medicines. Co-\npayments are waived for the poor, mothers, and children under 5 upon presentation of qualifying \nidentification  at  the  point  of  use.  The  government  will  continue  to  expand  NHI  and  introduce \nimplementation improvements, including quality interventions such as performance-based pay for \nhealth workers, as the scheme matures. This is expected to increase health service utilization, \nwhich will contribute significantly to health outcomes. \n \nStrengthening  human  resource  management.  The  Lao  PDR  has  3.1  health  workers \n9. \nper 1,000 people, but this average obscures the poor situation in rural and remote areas and does \nnot  indicate  what  skills  are  available.21  Although  most  health  centers  have  nurses,  a  medical \nassistant,  and  a  midwife,  specialty  staff  (e.g.,  laboratory  technicians  and  pharmacists)  are  not \nalways available. Health personnel databases for planning staff distribution and skills are still not \nfully functional. Many health workers have fewer than 3 years of professional training and receive \nno  regular  in-service  training  and  supportive  supervision.  There  are  also  concerns  about  the \ncommitment of health personnel: many health facilities have difficulty in hiring and retaining good \nquality staff, and one survey found that 34% of health workers, in particular those from district \nhealth centers, had changed jobs within 2 years.22 These issues stem in part from inadequate \nand  substandard  medical  education  and  training.  The  Lao  PDR  has  not  approved  standards \nregarding  accreditation  of  institutions  and  a  national  exam  to  assess  qualification  and  skills. \nInstead, graduates from medical institutions are given a permit or license to practice, which they \ncan hold indefinitely (there are no regulations for license renewal). The development of provincial \nworkforce plans that reflect staff profiles and requirements and make recommendations on staff \nincentives, in addition to the creation of a personnel database, will help address these challenges. \n \n                                                 \n17  The Sam Sang or \u201cthree builds\u201d decentralization directive proposes that villages will serve as the development unit, \n\ndistricts as the integration unit, and provinces as the strategic unit. \n\n18  Laos-Australia  Development  Learning  Facility.  2015.

Unpublished. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fStrengthening  the  health  sector  financial  management  system.  In  2013,  the \n10. \ngovernment  committed  to  increase  health  spending  to  9%  of  general  government  expenditure \n(GGE), including external aid and technical revenue.23 Although domestic government spending \non health has doubled during 2009\u20132013, health expenditure as a share of GGE averages just \n5.9%, and the situation is worsened by declining external aid.24 Health budget allocations vary \nsignificantly  by  province,  and  formulas  to  balance  these  allocations  have  not  yet  been \nintroduced.25  Financial  management  is  not  rigorous;  with  manual  bookkeeping  and  multiple \npayment sources, leading to fragmented and inaccurate monitoring of expenditures. Moreover, \nprogram and finance budget preparation are not in alignment: finance budgets are typically based \non preceding allocations and follow the chart of accounts, while program budgets use their own \naccounting  structure  often  with  inaccurate  costing,  making  it  difficult  to  link  and  sequence \nresources and track financial progress by program. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has introduced \na \u2018double entry\u2019 accounting system for the health sector to align program and financial budgets, \nbut the situation has been complicated by channeling of non-salary NHI operational expenditures \nthrough the NHIB, accompanied by an unclear division of labor between MOH and NHIB.26 \n \nADB  support.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  engagement  with  the  Lao  PDR  health \n11. \nsector  is  long-standing  and  wide-ranging (Figure).  ADB  began  supporting  hospitals  and  health \ncenters in 1995, starting in two northern provinces and eventually scaling up to eight provinces. \nSince 2001, ADB has been closely involved in communicable disease control and regional health \nsecurity. The Health Sector Development Program was ADB\u2019s first sector development program \nfor the Lao PDR health sector, and emphasized health systems strengthening for planning and \nfinancing, access to MNCH, and human resource quality.27 Prior to subprogram 1, ADB supported \nHSR  through  policy  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  that  established  a  foundation  for \nfinancial \ngovernance  reforms,  and  draft  plans \nmanagement.28 In addition to a policy-based loan, subprogram 1 provided a TA loan for equipment \nand  training  that  was  implemented  in  subprogram  2  (footnote  4).  An  additional  grant  supports \ncapacity  building  for  key  MOH  departments  carrying  out  HSR.29 In  public  sector  management, \nADB support has focused on creating medium-term budget frameworks (including for the health \nsector),  improving  fiscal  transfer  from  the  central  government  to  provincial  and  district \ngovernments,  building  civil  service  capacity,  strengthening  national  oversight  institutions,  and \nfacilitating private sector development.30 \n \n\nfor  human  resource  development  and \n\n \n\n                                                 \n23  This is mostly revenue from users at facilities. \n24  National Health Accounts Report, 2012\u20132016 (footnote 19, above).

Past  programs  have  been  strongly  aligned  with  MOH  policies,  and  therefore \nhighly  relevant,  but  development  partners  need  to  go  beyond  information  sharing  and  better \ncoordinate  activities  under  the  government\u2019s  single  reform  agenda.  To  this  end,  under \nsubprogram  2,  partners  are  engaging  through  technical  working  groups  to  jointly  achieve  the \nHSRS  pillars.  Past  interventions  reveal  constrained  provincial  managerial  capacity  and  limited \ncoordination  between  different  levels  of  the  health  system.  Long-term  engagement  through \nsubprograms 1 and 2 and complementary TA enable improved understanding of the informal and \nformal  rules  of  the  political  economy  that  shape  reform  processes,  and  support  for  building \nownership and appropriate leadership skills at the central and provincial levels. Policy reforms by \nnature take time and require continuous engagement and flexibility to respond rapidly to policy \nchanges. Past projects also show that better cost-sharing mechanisms are needed to make health \ncare more affordable for vulnerable groups. Subprogram 2 specifically targets the poor, women, \nand  children  under  5.  It  also  supports  NHI,  which  insures  the  population  from  catastrophic \nexpenditures. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nProgram alignment with the Health Sector Reform Strategy. The effect of the reform \nis  improved  health  service  coverage,  particularly  for  the  poor,  mothers,  and  children.31  Both \nsubprograms were designed to support the five pillars under the HSRS: (i) health financing; (ii) \nhuman resources for health; (iii) governance, organization, and management; (iv) health service \ndelivery; and (v) information, monitoring, and evaluation. Specific activities are envisioned across \nfour plan periods up to 2030 (subprogram 2 is synchronized with the 8th HSDP). Subprogram 2 \nadvances  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1,  with  the  government  accomplishing  17  policy \nactions (11 triggers and 6 milestones, Appendix 4). The government introduced NHI between the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  subprogram  1  (August  2013\u2013July  2015)  and  the  preparation  of \nsubprogram  2  (August  2015\u2013March  2018).  The  HEF  and  FMNCH  programs  were  subsumed \nunder  the  NHI  program.  The  government  will  ensure\u2014through  decrees,  guidelines,  and \nstrategies\u2014that benefits provided to the poor, mothers, and children under 5 under NHI equal or \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n                                                 \n31 The program team revised two targets in the design and monitoring framework: the target about population coverage \nwas revised to reflect the policy shift from HEF to NHI, and the target about midwives was revised to avoid repetition. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fexceed  those  provided  under  HEF  and  FMNCH,  and  are  provided  at  no  cost.32  Development \npartners have harmonized efforts to meet HSR goals. ADB has taken the lead on the first three \npillars, and other partners have prioritized pillars 4 and 5. The World Bank disburses funds based \non results in service delivery and information monitoring and evaluation. The Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  the  European  Union,  WHO,  Luxembourg  Development  Agency,  and  the \nSwiss Red Cross support financing, human resources, and service delivery.33 \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and value addition for the program \nlies in its cross-sector approach that addresses two themes\u2014public finance and governance\u2014\nthat  are  essential for  HSR.  ADB\u2019s  past  support to  the  Lao  PDR for  public  sector  and financial \nmanagement  helps  it  understand the  challenges  inherent  in  public  sector  management  reform \nprocesses that affect the health sector. As a development bank, ADB can provide significant fiscal \nand  technical  support  to  address  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  macroeconomic  situation.  ADB  continues  to \nsupport domestic policymaking in the health sector and provided critical inputs to the design of \nHSRS and NHI under both subprograms. ADB is also a strong contributor to development partner \nforums. Past health projects targeting the supply side and more recent projects on communicable \ndisease control and health security complement the program, and align with ADB\u2019s strategic vision \non  poverty  reduction,  gender  equity,  human  resource  development,  and  regional  cooperation; \nand its emphasis on governance and long-term support.34 \n \nReform  area  1:  Health  sector  reform  process  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \n15. \ngovernment established the National Commission on Health Sector Reform chaired by the vice-\nprime  minister.  The  commission  oversees  reform  progress  and  approves  annual  reports  and \nplans.  MOH  drafted  road  maps  to  strengthen  human  resources  and  financial  management  for \nhealth.  To  advance  these  reforms  under  subprogram  2,  the  cabinet  is  fully  functional  as  the \nsecretariat  for  the  national  commission.  To  aid  health  sector  coordination,  the  secretariat \nestablished an HSR coordination unit with 12 staff in August 2017 and HSR committees with focal \npoints to jointly manage HSR and decentralization reforms (footnote 17). MOH has finalized the \n2018 annual operational plan for the health sector, which integrates the 2018 HSR plan presented \nat  the  annual  national  commission  meeting  in  December  2017.  The  Minister  of  Health  has \napproved road maps on human resource development and financial management, which set clear \ndirections for HSR. \n \n16. \nReform  area  2:  Implementation  of  free  health  care  for  the  poor,  mothers,  and \nchildren  improved.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  expanded  the  number  of  HEF  and \nFMNCH beneficiaries.35 By 2014, HEF covered 43% of poor families and FMNCH services had \nbeen initiated in 88 of 146 districts.36 The government began phasing out HEF and FMNCH during \nsubprogram  2,  with  resources  instead  directed  to  NHI,  with  implementation  guidelines  for  the \nschemes harmonized to facilitate a smooth transition to NHI. MOF has created a fund to finance \n\n                                                 \n32 Summary  Assessment  of  Policy  Actions  under  Subprogram  2  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix  2).  The  assessment  outlines  the  original  indicative  policy  action,  status  of  accomplishments,  and \nformulation of policy actions for subprogram 2. All actions have been met as of 19 March 2018. \n\n33 Development  Coordination  (accessible  from  the  list of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).

The strategy includes health under its strategic priority to enhance human \ndevelopment. \n\n35 In subprogram 1, the reform area was to improve the implementation of the HEF and FMNCH schemes. Given the \n\nchange in policy direction toward NHI, this reform area has been reworded. \n\n36 About 110,000 mothers, 300,000 children under 5, and 620,000 poor people (Government of the Lao PDR, MOH. \n\n2017. Key Features of the Official Social Health Protection Schemes in Lao PDR. Vientiane). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fNHI to ensure continued provision of free health care for the poor, mothers, and children under 5; \nas of January 2018, NHI had begun in 141 districts, and will cover 80% of the population (5.65 \nmillion) by June 2019.37 MOH conducted a financial management assessment of NHI in 2017 to \nrevise NHI\u2019s implementation guidelines and evaluate reforms under both subprograms. \n \n17. \nReform area 3: Health human resource management capacity strengthened. Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  government  engaged  4,000  people  (many  of  whom  were  midwives)  to  the \nhealth  workforce  in  2014.  MOH  also  implemented  a  provincial  health  personnel  management \ninformation  system  (HPMIS)  to  improve  human  resource  management  and  planning.  MOH \ndefined quality standards for medical education institutions and approved competency standards \nfor  medical  professions,  including  dentistry,  to  be  included  in  the  training  curriculum.  Under \nsubprogram 2, MOH has improved the functionality of the HPMIS by developing an import module \nto transfer data from an online personnel management information system into the HPMIS. Data \ncan  now  be  aggregated  by  province,  district,  and  health  facility  for  better  planning  and \nmanagement.  MOH  also  expanded the  HPMIS to  capture  information  on  training, gender,  and \nethnicity.  Provincial  health  office  staff  have  undergone  training  to  use  the  HPMIS,  and  12 \nprovincial  health  offices  have  formulated  and  are  beginning  to  implement  provincial  workforce \ndevelopment  plans  to  guide  the  training  and  deployment  of  staff  in  remote  and  hard-to-reach \nareas.  This  is  particularly  important  for  continued  recruitment  of  midwives  to  help  improve \nmaternal health; between subprogram 1 and 2, the number of health centers with midwives has \nmore than doubled (from 33% of health centers in 2012\u20132013 to more than 75.1% in 2016). In \naddition,  MOH  has  issued  decrees  defining  the  licensing  and  registration  process  for  health \nprofessionals and developing quality standards and requirements for the accreditation of medical \neducation \nthe \nimplementation of these decrees. \n \n18. \nReform  area  4:  Health  sector  financial  management  system  strengthened.  Under \nsubprogram 1, MOH developed staff capacity in preparation for adopting a multiyear health sector \nbudget framework. MOH issued implementation guidelines to regulate the use and accounting of \nhealth facility user fees. To better understand resource mobilization and allocations in the health \nsector,  MOH  published  national  health  accounts  (NHAs)  for  FY2011  and  FY2012.  Under \nsubprogram 2, MOH has adopted the widely accepted unitary bookkeeping and reporting system \nto account for sources and uses of funds in health facilities. MOH has also established a budget \nexpenditure and disbursement monitoring system to document annual and quarterly expenditures \nand approved budgets. MOH has published NHAs for FY2013\u2013FY2016 and is building capacity \nto institutionalize NHA production in MOH\u2019s Department of Finance. Efforts are underway to better \nlink the finance and program budgets and report expenditures according to the chart of accounts \nand existing program codes. \n \n19. \nPost-program partnership framework. The post-program partnership framework (P3F) \nprovides a common understanding and proposes possible actions to be supported by ADB and \nother development partners following subprogram 2 (last column of Appendix 4). Broadly, P3F \nwill  sustain  the  reforms  initiated  under  the  program:  subprogram  2  supports  the  beginning  of \nphase  2  of the  HSRS  (2016\u20132020),  and  P3F sets  out  support for the  end  of  phase  2  and the \nbeginning of phase 3 (2021\u20132025). Under P3F, MOH will expand access to health facilities and \nbenefits  to  include  more  health  promotion,  prevention,  and  rehabilitative  interventions,  with  a \nfocus  on  quality  and  use  of  performance-based  incentives.  The  government  will  continue \nproviding  free  service  delivery  for  the  poor,  mothers,  and  children  under  5  under  NHI  and  will \n\ninstitutions.  The  newly  created  Health  Professionals\u2019  Council  oversees \n\n                                                 \n37 Based on projected total population of 7.06 million by 2019. United Nations Population Division. World Population \n\nProspects 2017. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nreduce OOP payments to 30% of total health expenditure by 2025. All health facilities will have \nthe  appropriate  number  and  level  of  skilled  health  workers  who  are  motivated,  trained,  and \nproperly incentivized. The HSRS aims to increase domestic health expenditure to 13% of GGE \nby 2025, with adequate budget allocations for women to ensure universal access to sexual and \nreproductive health services in accordance with SDG targets 3.7 and 5.6. ADB will provide TA \nsupport  for  NHIB  capacity  development,  including  carrying  out  an  expanded  NHI  evaluation; \nworkforce plan implementation in all provinces; and the further strengthening of the MOF \u2018double \nentry\u2019 accounting system. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for the Lao PDR fully \naligns with subprogram 2 and P3F, with continuing support for HSRS and the attainment of UHC \nin poor provinces, border areas, and economic corridors (footnote 34). \n \nC. \n \n20. \nEconomic and financial. Both the Lao PDR and ADB recognize that improving access \nto  health  care  without  financial  hardship  cannot  be  achieved  without  significant  government \nresources. Quantifying expected benefits accurately is difficult, but reforms especially in financial \nmanagement, health care financing, and human resources, which are widely perceived to be key \nbottlenecks for improving quality, efficiency, and equity, are strongly supported and will improve \nhealth service coverage and ultimately health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable groups. The \nprogram impact assessment estimates that support provided under subprograms 1 and 2 equal \n10.2%\u201313.1% of annual health sector capital requirements during 2016\u20132020.38   \n \nD. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $30  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n21. \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program.39  The  size  of \nsubprogram 2 reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, the strength of and commitment to the \nreform program, and the development expenditure arising from the reform program. The policy-\nbased  grant  considers  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  assessment  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  constraints,  including  a  large  current  account  deficit  and  high  external  debt \nstock.40 The 8th NSEDP states that the government\u2019s capital requirements for development during \n2016\u20132020  equal  $5.7  billion\u2013$7.3  billion.  Assuming  health  sector  investment  is  equal  to  the \ngovernment budget expenditure on health (5.9%), capital requirements will equal $336 million\u2013\n$431 million. Figures from FY2014 (footnote 19) show development partners finance around 18% \nof  health  expenditure;  subprogram  2  will  contribute  significantly  to  this  total.  The  grant  will  be \nprovided in a single tranche and may be withdrawn upon grant effectiveness. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n22. \nThe  executing  agency  for  the  program  is  MOH,  represented  by  the  Department  of \nPlanning  and  Cooperation.  As  the  executing  agency,  MOH  is  responsible  for  program \nimplementation, maintenance of all program records, and communicating with ADB on behalf of \n                                                 \n38  Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39  The latest debt sustainability analysis classified the Lao PDR\u2019s debt distress as high risk, making the country eligible \nfor  an  Asian  Development  Fund  grant.  However,  Lao  PDR\u2019s  per  capita  gross  national  income  exceeds  the \ninternational development association threshold, and the country will only be eligible for concessional lending from \n2019.

The MOH steering committee is chaired by the health minister and comprises \nvice-ministers  and  representatives  of  MOH  departments,  including  the  cabinet,  which  is \nresponsible for oversight of HSR implementation, and other ministries as requested. It provides \nguidance  on  program  implementation.  The  implementation  period  of  subprogram  2  started  in \nAugust  2015  and  will  end  in  March  2018. The grant  closing  date  is  31  December  2018.41  The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n23. \ntarget \nEnvironment.  ADB  has  reviewed  subprogram  2\u2019s  policy  actions\u2014which \ninstitutional arrangements, human resources, budget allocation, and financial management\u2014and \nimpacts  or  requirements  for  mitigation  measures. \nfound  no  anticipated  environmental \nConsequently,  the  program  is  classified  category  C  for  the  environment.  MOH  prepared  an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework for subprogram 1 (minor renovations of existing \nhealth centers were originally planned). No physical works were implemented under subprogram \n1, however, and none are envisaged under subprogram 2, and an environmental assessment and \nreview framework is thus not required. \n \n24. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  MOH  prepared  a  resettlement  screening  and  involuntary \nresettlement  framework  in  preparation  for  subprogram  1  to  address  impacts  associated  with \nplanned  refurbishment  of  health  facilities.  ADB  reviewed  policy  actions  carried  out  under \nsubprogram  2  and  found  no  new  health  facility  construction  or  refurbishment  activities  and  no \nplanned land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. A resettlement framework is therefore not \nrequired for subprogram 2 and the program is classified category C for involuntary resettlement \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n25. \nEthnic groups. The program is classified category B for indigenous peoples because of \nthe  program\u2019s  potential  positive  impacts.  MOH  prepared  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  plan,  with \ncorresponding mitigation  measures, for  subprogram  1  and  the TA  loan  to  assess the  program \nactivities\u2019 potential impact on ethnic groups and to ensure that ethnic groups benefited equally \nfrom the program activities. MOH updated the indigenous people\u2019s plan and subsumed it into the \nmatrix of potential environmental and social impacts and measures for subprogram 2 to reflect \nkey issues, policy actions, potential impacts, and mitigating actions.42 Further, MOH revised the \nindigenous  people\u2019s  plan  during  the  midterm  review  of  the  TA  loan  in  August  2017  and  will \ncontinue to implement it during the TA loan term. \n \n26. \nGender.  Both  subprograms  1  and  2  are  classified  gender  equity  as  a  theme  as  they \npromote  and  contribute  to  achieving  gender  equality  by  enhancing  women\u2019s  access  to  health \nservices.  Subprogram  2  continues  to  prioritize  support  for  poor  provinces  with  ethnic  minority \npopulations that typically have greater maternal health care needs. MOH has initiated policies for \nincreasing access to NHI, including FMNCH services, and the number of health centers with at \nleast one community midwife for safe delivery. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 includes gender-\nrelated policy actions. ADB revised the gender action plan, supported by the TA loan, during the \nmidterm review to better reflect the current context (e.g., alignment with new NHI scheme) and to \nimprove  its quality  by  rewording  some targets.43  Gender  action  plan  achievements  include  the \n\n                                                 \n41 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Indigenous People\u2019s Plan and Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n43 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nfollowing:  (i)  more  than  75.1%  of  1,017  health  centers  have  at  least  one  midwife;44  (ii)  MOH \ndeveloped  a  detailed  road  map  guiding  preparation  of  a  national  strategy  to  promote  gender \nequality in the health sector; and (iii) workforce development plans that include action points on \ngender and equity policies to support women\u2019s employment, placement, retention, promotion, and \ncapacity  development  in  the  health  sector  were  formulated.  The  number  of  female  staff \nundertaking training and fellowships on public health and financial management, and availability \nof data on utilization and personnel disaggregated by sex and ethnicity, have both increased. \n \nRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks assessment and mitigating measures are \n27. \nsummarized  in  the  table  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.45 \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe government is committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability \nand reducing vulnerabilities with fiscal reforms, restructuring of weak \npublic banks, and equitization of some state-owned enterprises. \nThe government is taking administrative measures such as capping \nexpenditure increases by freezing civil servant salaries and limiting \nintake to improve revenue collection.
