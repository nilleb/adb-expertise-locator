The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nEuropean Union (EU) for the project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2. \nThe project adopts a sector approach for developing sustainable, inclusive, and climate-\nresilient water supply and improved sanitation in the greater Honiara area (GHA) and in five other \ntowns of Auki, Gizo, Noro, Munda, and Tulagi  in Solomon Islands.1 The project will implement \nhigh priority components following the government\u2019s water and sanitation sector plan to increase \naccess  to  piped  water  supply  and  sanitation  service,  especially  among  the  poor  households; \nreduce reliance on groundwater and rainwater harvest and ensure more efficient use of water. \nThe project will also enhance hygiene awareness, promote water conservation and improve fecal \nsludge management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  growth.  Solomon  Islands  is  the  third  largest  developing  island  country  in \n3. \nPacific  with  a  population  of  around  660,000.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  recognizes \nSolomon Islands as a fragile and conflict-affected situation following the civil conflict from 1998 to \n2003.2 Since the end of the conflict, Solomon Islands has experienced steady economic growth. \nHowever,  economic  development  has  been  largely  diluted  across  a  fast-increasing  population \nbase  (more  than  2%  per  year  since  2004)  and  the  projected  2019  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct of $1,751, when adjusted for inflation, remains lower today than it was before the conflict. \nThe United Nations classifies it as a least-developed country.3 \n \n4. \nVulnerability  to  natural  hazards.  Solomon  Islands  is  highly  vulnerable  to  natural \nhazards, including tropical storms and earthquakes, and is highly susceptible to climate change \nimpacts. Since 1930, Solomon Islands has been struck by some 71 disasters triggered by natural \nhazards. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery estimates that Solomon Islands \nincurs  losses  of  $20  million  annually  because  of  earthquakes  and  tropical  cyclones.4  Flash \nflooding in April 2014, which impacted Honiara, Makira, Malaita, and the Isabel Islands, caused \n47 deaths, affected some 52,000 persons, and resulted in damage and losses of $107.8 million \n(9.2% of gross domestic product). Honiara experienced flash flooding, which resulted in prolonged \ndisruptions  to  water  supply  and  sewerage  services.  Climate  change  models  indicate  a  high \nlikelihood that the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events will increase, and that the \naverage duration of extreme drought could increase to 30 months or more by 2050. \n \n5. \nUrban development context. About 152,000 (24%) of the Solomon Islands\u2019 population \nlive  in  7  urban  and  peri-urban  areas.  About  one  third  of  the  urban  population  live  in  informal \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a technical assistance grant and project readiness financing to prepare \nthe project.

The urban households obtain their drinking water from the public \nwater supply schemes (55%), household rainwater tanks (42%), wells and springs (1%), and other \nsources such as bottled water and streams (2%). Groundwater and springs are the main water \nsource  for  the  piped  water  supplies.5  Rainwater  harvesting  is  being  increasingly  utilized  by \nhouseholds to increase access to potable water but is not secure due to seasonal rainfall patterns \nand more frequent droughts due to climate change. GHA, comprising the Solomon Islands capital \nof  Honiara,  and  surrounding  peri-urban  areas  is  the  largest  urban  center  with  a  population  of \nabout 105,000 and a land area of about 133 square kilometers. Currently, about 60% of people \nliving  in  GHA  have  access  to  the  public  water  supply  system  and  75%  have  access  to  basic \nsanitation. \n \n6. \n Based on medium growth projections, Solomon Islands\u2019 urban population may grow to \n430,000  by  2050  while  the  population  of  GHA  is  expected  to  surpass  300,000.  Urban \ndevelopment in Solomon Islands presents a number of challenges, including: (i) a rapid urban \npopulation growth (4.7%) which is more than double the national population growth; (ii) expansion \nof  informal  settlements;  and  (iii)  decreasing  rates  of  access  to  basic  urban  services  such  as \nelectricity, public water supply and sanitation, solid waste collection and drainage. Investment in \nurban infrastructure has not been commensurate with the growing urban population and budgets \nfor operations and maintenance have historically been inadequate. Due to lack of coordination, \nurban planning, management and development has been ad hoc. To better address the urban \nchallenges facing GHA, the Government of Solomon Islands endorsed the Greater Honiara Urban \nDevelopment  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  in  September  2018.6  The  action  plan  prioritizes \ninvestments  to  improve  the  coverage  and  quality  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  for \nsustainable urban development and better living conditions in GHA. \n \nThe Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA), a state-owned enterprise created under the \n7. \nSolomon  Islands Water  Authority  Act  1992,  is  mandated  to  develop  and  manage  urban  water \nsupply and sewerage services in Solomon Islands. SIWA has 145 staff. It delivers water supply \nservices to 8,000 households in GHA and 1,000 in the other three urban centers (Auki, Noro, and \nTulagi). Sixty percent of water resource is from surface water springs and 40% from wellbores. \nSIWA  also  provides  sewerage  services  in  GHA  to  approximately  10%  of  the  residents.  GHA \ncovers 90% of SIWA\u2019s water supply customers and all sewerage customers. Under the project, \nSIWA will expand its water supply operations to cover 1,200 households in both Gizo and Munda. \n \n8. \nHistorically, the financial management of SIWA was poor. In August 2010, the Solomon \nIslands Government commenced a series of reforms to strengthen SIWA. As a result, its financial \nposition has improved following tariff adjustments in 2016 and 2018 and improved bill collection. \nFinancial  projections  indicate  that  SIWA\u2019s  financial  position  will  continue  to  improve.  SIWA  is \ncommitted to strengthening asset management further by contributing to the project\u2019s investment \ncosts. \n \nIn GHA, currently SIWA water production is 32.0 MLD and water is supplied or 22 hours \n9. \nper day. The water supply gap is primarily due to high non-revenue water (NRW) of 62% of water \nproduction.7 The project will reduce NRW to 30% or less and expand the water treatment capacity \nto  enable  SIWA  to  expand  its  service  from  8,000  to  14,000  households  (49%  to  65%)  with \ncontinuous water supply in GHA. If the new water source needed for GHA is built by 2028, SIWA \nwill continue to extend its water supply service to 95% of the GHA population by 2047. \n \n\n5   SIWA. 2017.

The total length of the sewers is 36 \nkilometers serving about 1,000 households. The sewer network was constructed more than fifty \nyears ago without adequate maintenance. The ocean outfalls have broken above the shoreline \nand raw sewage is discharged to beaches and rivers, creating many environmental and health \nhazards. Through the project, SIWA will upgrade and join sewer systems to reduce the outfalls. \nIt will expand its sewage network coverage to at least 4,000 households (20% of residential) and \nmost  of  non-residential properties.  The remaining  households  in  the  city  are  served  by on-site \nsanitation  systems  (mainly  septic  tanks  and  pit  latrines),  which  are  regulated  by  Honiara  City \nCouncil. Septic tank desludging is provided by the private sector on demand basis. Fecal sludge \ncollected from septic tanks is currently transported to a dump site or illegally dumped elsewhere, \nleading  to  health  and  environmental  hazards.  There  is  urgent  need  to  improve  the  septic \nmanagement. \n \nNeed for a sector approach.8 SIWA has prepared a comprehensive strategic sector plan, \n11. \nthe  Solomon  Water  30  Year  Strategic  Plan,  and  a  5  Year  Action  Plan.9  The  project  will  be \nimplemented  through  a  sector  modality  and  will  be  implemented  in  GHA  and  five  other  urban \ntowns. Feasibility studies and due diligence review for selected subprojects in GHA have been \nconducted.10 The detailed engineering design is ongoing. Additional subprojects will be confirmed \nand prepared during the implementation stage based on selection criteria and readiness.11 The \nproject  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Strategy  Objective  3:  All  Solomon \nIslanders have access to quality social services, including education and health, and will assist \nSolomon  Islands  to  meet  Goal 6  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  The  project  is  also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, specifically the differentiated approach for fragile and conflict \naffected situations, small island developing states and its operational priorities of making cities \nmore livable and tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability.  Climate  resilience  and  climate  change  adaptation  costs  are \nestimated to be $7.7 million. ADB is administering 79.3% of the adaptation costs. Details are in \nthe climate risk assessment.12 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  access  to  safe  water  and  improved \nsanitation  in  urban  areas  increased.13  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency, \nclimate change and disaster resiliency, and sustainability of safe water and sanitation in GHA and \nother five urban areas improved.14  \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Urban water supplies are continuous and safe. Selected subprojects in this \noutput are located in GHA and will: (i) expand the surface water intake with additional  5 MLD, \nupgrade water treatment plant capacity in Kongulai (15 MLD), (ii) build new 11 km treated water \ntrunk mains in Mataniko and White River areas, (iii) build two new reservoirs (12 million liters). \nAdditional subprojects include (i) leak detection and repair including rehabilitation of 10km water \npipes, expansion 70km new water pipes in GHA, (ii) upgrading water systems in Auki, Noro, and \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n8  Sector assessment summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  SIWA.  2017.

The subproject in this output is selected. It will design and \ndeliver  a  gender-sensitive  education  program  to  raise  community  awareness  about  water \nconservation, environmental protection, and hygiene practices including informal settlements (at \nleast 50% are women). The costs of delivering water supply and sanitation services and the need \nfor water and sanitation tariffs will be highlighted. Menstrual hygiene management training and \nproducts would be provided to women and girls. \n \n16. \nOutput  4:  Solomon  Islands  Water  Authority  is  financially  and  technically \nsustainable.  The  subprojects  in  this  output  are selected.  They  will:  (i)  prepare  and  implement \nfinancial management policies including tariff management framework and tariff review process, \namong others; (ii) design and implement capacity building programs for SIWA staff including the \ntechnical  training  and  on-the-job  training;  (iii)  design  and  implement  preventative  maintenance \nprograms and asset management; (iv) expand SIWA\u2019s telemetry system; and (v) introduce and \nimplement  SIWA  personnel  incentive  schemes.  Since  SIWA  is  responsible  for  all  urban  water \nsupply  and  sewage  service, Output  4  will  support  SIWA to continue  the recovery  of  its  annual \noperations and maintenance costs, asset depreciation costs, and debt servicing costs. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s engagement in Solomon Islands\u2019 water and sanitation sector adds value in several \nareas, including (i) bringing in extensive Pacific developing member country experience in water \nand sanitation infrastructure investments and associated technical assistance, (ii) providing best \npractices for water utility institutional strengthening and capacity building, (iii) expanding services \nin  low-income  and  informal  areas,  (iv)  cost-effective  citywide  fecal  sludge  management,  and \n(v) helping  the  government  and  SIWA  to  address  project  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nissues. ADB provided technical assistance to support project preparation and also provided a $3 \nmillion project readiness facility grant that finances detailed engineering designs and strengthens \nthe capacity of SIWA and the project management unit (PMU). Project design reflects lessons \nfrom  previous  relevant  ADB  and  development  partner  sector  operations  in  Pacific  developing \nmember countries. Key lessons include (i) improving the project design and ensuring adequate \ntechnical understanding of the factors affecting the project, such as water source availability and \ncost estimation, (ii) prioritized investment should be more focused to avoid dilution of resources, \nand (iii) urban service demand and willingness to pay must be ensured. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n15 New metered connections will include 6,000 in GHA, 100 in Auki, 1,000 in Gizo, 100 in Noro, 200 in Munda, and 100 \n\nin Tulagi. 2019 baseline: GHA: 8,000, Auki: 500, Gizo: 0, Munda: 0, Noro: 400, and Tulagi: 100.  \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $92.82  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).16  The \ngovernment has requested (i) a concessional loan of $28.00 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and (ii) a grant not exceeding $9.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements.  The  government  has  also  applied  to  the  EU  for  a  grant  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac18.00 \nmillion, to be fully administered by ADB, to help finance the project. EU cofinancing of the project \nwill be on a pro rata basis. The World Bank will also provide a concessional loan of $15.00 million \ntoward  the  costs  of  the  project  on  a  joint  collaborative  basis.  The  government  will  contribute \n$11.47  million  equivalent  through  the  exemption  of  taxes  and  duties  and  SIWA  will  contribute \n$9.00 million equivalent toward the project cost. The government will relend the ADB and World \nBank loans funds to SIWA on terms acceptable to ADB and World Bank. The government will on-\ngrant the grant proceeds to SIWA to support its move towards a sustainable financial position. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n  \nItem \nA.

Engineering designs are built on past \nstudies, including the 30 Year Strategic Plan and the 5 Year Action Plan. Until the implementation \nof a new major water production system (Lungga), recommended by the 30 Year Strategic Plan \nin the mid-2020s, the additional water demand from SIWA\u2019s customers will be met by (i) reducing \nNRW, (ii) enhancing water conservation management (including installing prepayment meters), \nand (iii) upgrading the existing water production capacity. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nFinancial  analyses  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  selected  subprojects  were \nundertaken using with- and without-project scenarios over a 30-year operational period, with the \nresidual  value  at  the  end  of  this  period  assumed  to  be  zero.  The  financial  costs  were  used, \nincluding  the  recurrent  replacement  costs  of  capital  equipment  items,  but  excluding  price \ncontingencies and interest and other charges during construction. Consulting costs were included \nin  the  analysis.  The  water  supply  subproject  on  its  own  has  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR) of 11.1% and financial net present value (FNPV)  of $128.4 million, while the sanitation \nsubproject has an FIRR of 0.9% and FNPV of \u2013$3.9 million. The overall project has an FIRR of \n11.9% and FNPV of $247.9 million. \n \n23. \nEconomic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  selected  subprojects  by  comparing  the \ndiscounted costs and benefits under the with- and without-project scenarios over 2020\u20132050 in \nconstant 2019 prices. The without-project case represents a continuation of the existing situation \nwhile the with-project case represents the project investment scenario. The economic internal rate \nof return for the selected subprojects is estimated at 13.1%, higher than the opportunity cost of \ncapital (9%). Sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the key parameters of incremental \ncosts  including  investment,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  incremental  benefits.  The \nsensitivity analysis tested the following scenarios: (i) a 20% increase in investment costs, (ii) a \n20% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 20% decrease in the incremental supply benefits, and (iv) a 2-\nyear  delay.  Under  these  scenarios,  the  viability  of  the  selected  subprojects  reduces,  with \neconomic internal rates of return ranging from 9.8% to 12.9%. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nTo ensure the technical sustainability of the project, the infrastructure will be designed and \nbuilt using climate-proofed approaches and high durability of materials. Projected climate change \nimpacts are considered including longer severe droughts; sea level rise; and increased rainfall \n\nSustainability \n\n \n\n18 The Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions dated 9 April 2010 entered into between ADB and \nother  multilateral  development  banks  (including  the  World  Bank),  which  enables  ADB  to  cross-debar  entities \ndebarred  by  other  multilateral  development  banks  (including  the  World  Bank),  is  insufficient  because  only \ndebarments that meet certain conditions are eligible for cross-debarment. \n\n \n\n\fGovernance  \n\n8 \n \nvariability, both seasonally and annually, which is likely to cause flash floods and landslides. The \nreduction of NRW will increase water availability for the households, conserve water resources \nand reduce energy consumption and carbon emission. As result was found in recent pilot areas \nin  GHA,  the  installation  of  prepayment  meters  in  the  project  will  also  lead  to  a  potential  water \nconservation.19 The upgrading of water sources will further balance the use of groundwater and \nsurface  water  resources  in  SIWA\u2019s  portfolio,  thereby  hedging  the  related  risks.  In  parallel,  to \nensure  sustainability  from  the  customer  or  user  perspective,  the  project  will  implement  a \ncomprehensive  awareness  and  behavior  campaign  to  promote  good  hygiene  practices,  water \nconservation and importance to pay the tariffs in the communities. \n \n25. \nThe project sustainability is further guaranteed by the investment from SIWA, which will \nfinance $9 million to the project. This shows the healthy financial position of the utility, high priority \nand strong ownership of the project, and confidence in sustaining long-term O&M. Overall, the \nproject\u2019s financial sustainability will be ensured through (i) improving SIWA\u2019s operational efficiency \nto  minimize  operating  costs;  (ii)  expanding  SIWA\u2019s  customer  base  to  increase  revenues;  (iii) \npromoting a regulated water and sewage tariff and ensuring the service affordability; 20 and (iv) \nthe government\u2019s commitment to SIWA\u2019s financial sustainability, which was formally reiterated by \nthe Ministry of Finance and Treasury to SIWA in late 2018. \n \nD. \n \nSince the financial reforms initiated in 2010, SIWA\u2019s operational capacity and performance \n26. \nhave  also  been  improved  such  as  metering,  billing  and  collections,  and  operating  profits. \nCurrently,  93%  of  SIWA\u2019s  water  customers  are  billed  on  meter  readings  and  the  remaining \ncustomers are billed at a fixed rate. In 2018, the water and sewage tariff collection ratio reached \n100%, and the operational cost coverage ratio reached 1.37. SIWA\u2019s financial position changed \nfrom an operating loss in 2010 to a surplus of about $2.0 million in 2017. \n \n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  agency  concluded  that  the \nfinancial  management  risk  was  low.  In  the  case  of  SIWA,  the  financial  management  risk  was \nassessed substantial because (i) SIWA has no prior experience as an implementing agency with \nresponsibilities  for  loan  and  grant  disbursements  and  advance  account  management,  but  has \nprevious  experience  with  international  funding  support  (grants);  and  (ii)  SIWA\u2019s  accounting \nsystem  is  adequate,  but  will  require  modification  to  integrate  project-specific  accounting, \nbudgeting,  auditing,  and  reporting  requirements.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  (i)  SIWA  will  hire \nadequately  skilled  staff  with  project  accounting  experience  to  directly  oversee  the  financial \noperations of the project (including reporting) and (ii) SIWA staff will undergo online training on \nADB\u2019s  procurement  and  disbursement  processes  before  project  implementation  starts  and \nregularly as part of their on-the-job training. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  SIWA.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nE. \n \nAn estimated 25% of Solomon Islanders live below the international poverty line of $1.90 \n28. \nper person per day in 2011 purchasing power parity terms. The rapid rural\u2013urban migration and \nunplanned urban expansion  in Solomon Islands is  resulting  in housing  pressure,  public  health \nrisks,  a  high  cost  of  urban  living,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  challenges.  Peri-urban \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n19 In the pilot cases, per capita per day water consumption dropped from 169 liters to 137 liters. \n20 A legal covenant has been included in the legal agreements to ensure that a review of SIWA\u2019s water tariffs (including \n\na focus on affordability aspects) is completed by the end of 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nhouseholds in GHA suffer from disproportionate levels of poverty, with up to 25% of the population \nbelow Solomon Islands poverty line of basic needs. 21 The project will indirectly reduce poverty by \nextending potable water and sanitation services, particularly to informal settlements. Poor quality \nof  drinking  water  has  increased  disease  burden,  with  negative  economic  consequences  that \ndisproportionately impact women, the poor, and vulnerable sections of the society. Households \nwithout  proper  toilet  facilities  are  more  exposed  to  the  risk  of  waterborne  diseases.  This \nsignificantly impacts productivity and family health expenditures. \n \n29. \nOther social and poverty issues in the country include (i) unemployment, with 45% of youth \nunemployed; (ii) lack of skills and expertise as a result of poor quality education and inadequate \ntraining; (iii) poor transport infrastructure, leading to isolation and lack of markets; and (iv) gender \ninequality,  resulting  in  high  rates  of  violence  against  women.  The  government\u2019s  National \nDevelopment  Strategy  addresses  many  of  these  issues  and  other  development  partners \nsupporting health, education, and transport reforms. 22 \n \n30. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Unsafe and insecure water and \nsanitation services significantly affect women\u2019s time poverty (time collecting and preparing water \nas  well  as  caring  for  sick  family  members  as  a  result  of  waterborne  diseases).  Other  issues \nhighlighted  by women and  girls  include barriers in connecting  to  services (such  as connection \nfees and documentation needed), menstrual hygiene, limited income-generation opportunities for \nwomen,  and  limited  participation  in  decision  making.  Specific  gender  design  features  include \n(i) supporting women\u2019s employment; (ii) supporting women\u2019s decision making by setting up water \nuser  groups;  (iii)  addressing  barriers  to  connecting  to  services  by  providing  gender-sensitive \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene-awareness and behavior campaigns and training for households \non willingness to pay for services, including discussion in the household on women\u2019s role in water \ncollection and preparation; and (iv) provision of menstrual hygiene training and products. \n \nF. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows: 23 \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category B). The project is classified category B for environment. An initial \nenvironmental examination and environmental assessment and review framework were prepared \nfor  the  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).24  The  project \nprovides  positive  environmental  benefits  by  improving  sewerage  and  sanitation  (including \ntreatment  and  discharge  operations),  and  delivering  high-priority  elements  of  SIWA\u2019s  30  Year \nStrategic Plan and 5 Year Action Plan. Adverse environmental impacts of the project will be site-\nspecific, largely related to construction activities, which are expected to be minimal for land-based \nworks  and  for  which  mitigation  measures  can  be  readily  implemented.  The  proposed  sewer \neffluent outfall construction requires that the mitigation measures identified in the environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  are  implemented  to  reduce  and  manage  impacts  on  the  marine \nenvironment.  The  EMP  also  outlines  the  risks  and  mitigating  actions  to  be  undertaken  during \nproject  implementation.  SIWA\u2019s  environmental  management  capacity  is  limited,  and  an \ninternational and a national environment specialist will be engaged through the project to support \nSIWA\u2019s  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  EMP  and  to  strengthen  SIWA\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement capacity. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n21 The basic needs poverty line in Honiara is estimated at $2.49 per person per day. \n22  Government  of  Solomon  Islands.  2016.

A \n33. \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement, \nand  a  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  selected  subprojects.  The  project  affects  about \n20,648 square meters (m2) and requires the acquisition of 15,706 m2 of land. The balance of the \nimpacted land (4,942 m2) is within existing reserves and easements and government-owned land. \nNon-land  impacts  are  associated  with  one  informal  residential  structure  to  be  relocated,  some \ngardens and crops, and temporary impacts on nonresidential structure that could be reestablished \nonce the works are completed. Some 75 persons will be affected, with 11 considered significantly \naffected.  This  will  be  confirmed  following  the  detailed  design  and  during  the  update  of  the \nresettlement  plan.  Consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  the  affected  persons  and  will \ncontinue during project implementation. The draft safeguard documents have been disclosed by \nSIWA. SIWA and the government will finance, implement, and monitor the resettlement plan. The \nPMU,  which  includes  a  social  safeguards  specialist,  will  support  SIWA  in  implementing  the \nresettlement  plan  and  provide  safeguard  capacity  building  to  SIWA  staff.
