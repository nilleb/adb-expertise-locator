The government agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), under the extended \nfund  facility  (EFF),  to  reduce  the  energy  sector's  burden  on  the  annual  state  budget  and  its \nnegative  impact  on  economic  growth.2 The  government  has  met  the  requirements  for  the  first \nand second IMF reviews.3 The program is fully coordinated with the EFF. Based on the findings \nand lessons from previous interventions, the government needs support to realize and sustain \nthe reforms set out in the power policy.  \n \n3. \nThe proposed program takes a chronological approach over 5 years, with a subprogram \ntargeted for each year and matched to the annual budget schedule. Long-term engagement is \nnecessary  because  the  reforms  are  multidimensional  and  through  their  cumulative  effect, \nrequire a number of years to yield optimal results. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\n4. \n Pakistan\u2019s economic growth slowed markedly in 2013, resulting in a 5-year average of \n3%, which is well below the 7% annual growth necessary for sufficient employment creation to \nabsorb the new entrants into the labor force. The chronic power shortage is estimated to have \nslowed  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  by  at  least  2  percentage  points  per  year  and  is \ndeemed  to  be  the  major  cause  of  a  decline  in  large-scale  manufacturing,  which  grew  by  just \n1.2% in 2012 and 2.8% in 2013. Without reliable power, factories are not able to deliver orders \non  time  and  have  lost  contracts.  Textile  exports,  which  account  for  more  than  50%  of  goods \nexport receipts, have  only  increased marginally  since  2010. The  steady deterioration  of  power \navailability has also hurt business confidence. Private investment has decreased by 7.5% since \n2008.  Power  sector  subsidies  remain  high  at  1.8%  of  GDP,  or  $3.8  billion,  despite  a  160% \nincrease in power  tariffs  since  2008.4 Power  sector  subsidies  combined with  low  tax  revenues \nare a significant contributor to the government\u2019s weak fiscal position. High fiscal deficits (8% of \nGDP in FY2013) led to more government borrowing, mainly from the domestic banking system, \nand  elevated  public  debt  (62.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2013).  The  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 requires the government to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% by \nJune  2013  (i.e.,  the  end  of  FY2013)  and  maintain  that  ratio  at  below  60%  from  July  2013 \n                                                \n1   On  27  July  2013,  the  Council  of  Common  Interests  approved  the  National  Power  Policy  to  support  current  and \n\nfuture energy needs of the country. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/National%20Power%20Policy%202013.pdf \n\n2  On 4 September 2013, the International Monetary Fund board approved a $6.7 billion, 36-month program under the \n\nEFF that aims to bring down inflation and reduce the fiscal deficit to more sustainable levels. \n\n  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13287.pdf \n3   The  first  review  was  completed  on  8  November  2013;  the  second  review  was  completed  on  10  February  2014. \nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr1401.pdf,  https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr1490.pdf \n4   The average tariff increased from PRs4.26 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to PRs8.81 per kWh in May 2012, and further to \n\nPRs11.11 per kWh in October 2013. In the same period, the consumer price index rose by 96%. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nonward. The public debt-to-GDP ratio was 62.7% in FY2013, mainly owing to the actual deficit \nbeing  higher  than  projected.5 The government  expects that the ratio  will  be  61.4% for  FY2014 \nand will take measures to maintain it below 60% from FY2015 onwards.6 The continued pursuit \nof  tax  and  structural  reforms  to  achieve  fiscal  consolidation,  underpinned  by  the  IMF  program \nand  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  is  expected  to  strengthen  the  fiscal \nposition.  Fiscal  performance  was  on track  in the second quarter  of  FY2014.7 With  strong fiscal \nadjustment, public debt is expected to decline gradually (footnote 6). \n \nReforms in Pakistan\u2019s power sector have been ongoing since 1992. However, the pace \n5. \nhas  been  slow  and  the  expected  efficiencies  have  yet  to  materialize.  The  unbundling  and \ncorporatization  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  into  nine  regional  power \ndistribution  companies  (DISCOs),  four  thermal  power  generation  companies  (GENCOs),  a \ntransmission  company  licensed  as  a  single buyer  and  seller  of  electricity,  and the  hydropower \nplants still retained by the Water and Power Development Authority was  accomplished, but all \nentities  are  still  fully  owned  by  the  government.  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company  has  been \nprivatized. Privately owned independent power producers (IPPs) generate 56% of the country\u2019s \npower.  The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  determines  tariffs,  issues \nlicenses,  and  regulates  the  sector.  Around  two-thirds  of  the  population  has  access  to  grid \nelectricity. The consumption of electricity has remained constrained and relatively static at about \n70 terawatts  per year since 2007. The key issues are described below.  \n \n6. \nTariffs and subsidies. The government does not pass on the total cost to the electricity \ncustomers  and  provides  subsidies  to the  DISCOs for the  difference  between the  tariff  billed to \nthe  customers  and  the  cost-recovery  tariff  determined  by  NEPRA.  The  country\u2019s  dwindling \nnatural  gas  reserves  and  stagnant  hydropower  generation  capacity,  which  used  to  be  the \nprimary  sources  of  electricity,  have  resulted  in  greater  use  of  imported  fuel  oil. 8  Power \ngeneration  costs  have  increased  significantly  due  to  higher  reliance  on  imported  fuel  oil, \nincreasing  the  demand\u2013supply  gap  to  one-third  of  demand  in  2013,  and  worsening  the \nshortage.  Strong  efforts  are  needed  to  increase  domestic  gas  supply,  explore  the  sizable \ndomestic coalfields, and develop hydropower, which all will help lower power generation costs.   \n \n7. \nThe difference between the customer tariff and the cost-recovery tariff, and the delay in \ndetermining  and  applying  the  cost-recovery  tariff  and  paying  the  subsidies  have  led  to \n(i) substantial  and  costly  payment  arrears  to  fuel  suppliers  and  IPPs;  (ii)  decreased  efficiency \ndue to lack of funds for maintenance and augmentation of equipment; (iii) critically low working \ncapital  of  the  public  and  private  sectors,  leading  to  payment  arrears;  and  (iv)  concerns  by \nprivate investors and their financiers about the creditworthiness of the power sector. \n \n8. \nSector  performance  and  private  sector  participation. In 2012, electricity distribution \nand transmission losses reached 23% and collection amounted to 86% of total billing, compared \nwith  NEPRA\u2019s  targets  for  losses  (16%)  and  collection  (100%).  Gas  distribution  losses  totaled \n11% against 4.5% allowed by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority. Public companies dominate \nthe energy sector and losses in efficiency have remained largely unchanged since 2008.

Pakistan:  Second  Review  under  the  Extended  Arrangement  and  Request  for  Waivers  of \nNonobservance of Performance Criteria. Washington, DC. \n\n7   IMF.  2014.  Statement  at  the  Conclusion  of  an  IMF  Staff  Mission  on  Pakistan.  Press  Release  No.  14/46, \n\nWashington, DC. \n\n8  Hydropower\u2019s share declined from 72% (1980) to 32% (2012). The share of gas in the thermal generation fuel mix \nhas fallen from 56% (2006) to 44% (2011), while heavy fuel oil increased from 42% to 54% during the same period. \n\n\f3 \n\nsector  customers'  unpaid  bills  have  increased  by  359%  during  the  same  period. 9 The  poor \nperformance  of  the  public  sector  companies  caused  further  accumulation  of  unpaid  electricity \ngeneration bills. In 2013, the government injected $3.8 billion in equity into the DISCOs to clear \nthese  losses.  On  the  demand  side,  inefficient  industrial  processes  and  equipment,  household \nand  commercial  appliances,  and  buildings  are  all  sources  of  energy  wastage.  Private \nparticipation  in  the  energy  sector  is  curtailed  because  of  chronic  concern  about  payment  to \npower  suppliers,  unclear  investment  policies  and  guidelines,  and  lack  of  transparent  payment \npractices.  The  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA)  was  to  provide  a  transparent \nsettlement  system  and  to  evolve  into  a  multibuyer  and  multiseller  trading  platform  for \ncompetitive  electricity  pricing.  CPPA's  separation  from  the  transmission  company  is  still  being \nimplemented, while NEPRA is consulting the public for a model wheeling charge agreement that \nwould  simplify  procedures  for  electricity  trading.  Public  sector  energy  companies  have  been \nslated for privatization. \n \n9. \nAccountability  and  transparency.  The  lack  of  transparency  in  the  operation  and \npayment mechanisms has made it difficult to hold public sector companies accountable for their \nperformance.  Automatic  meters  have  now  been  installed  at  the  11-kilovolt  level,  allowing  real-\ntime monitoring of neighborhood-specific losses. An extension of automatic meters to customers \nwill  be  needed  to  prevent  overbilling  and  theft.  Since  the  system  lacks  funds  to  pay  for  the \npower generated, power suppliers are uncertain about the priority and timing of payment. There \nwere concerns raised on the payments to IPPs not being based on merit.     \n \n10. \nChanges needed for Pakistan's ailing energy sector to become sustainable and reliable \ncannot  be  realized  overnight.  Careful  sequencing  of  policy  actions  and  full  implementation  of \ndifficult decisions are needed. The program is designed to align each subprogram with targets \nfor  each  period  and thus  enable achievement  of  the  desired  long-term  outcome  by  the  end of \nthe  program.  Reform  progress  will  be  reviewed  quarterly,  together  with  the  IMF\u2013EFF  reviews. \nGiven  the  sector\u2019s  dynamic  nature  and  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  condition,  the  flexibility \nimbedded  in  this  modality  enables  timely  action  and  necessary  adjustments  to  achieve  the \nprogram\u2019s impact and outcome.  \n \n11. \nADB  assistance.  ADB  is  the  leading  partner  in  the  sector  and  is  engaged  holistically, \nsupporting energy efficiency, transmission, distribution, cross-border natural gas pipelines, power \ngeneration,  and  renewable  energy. 10 The  power  policy  and  the  proposed  program  follow  the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy  Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired  with  the  government.11 Through  similar  interventions,  such  as  the  Energy  Sector \nRestructuring Program (ESRP), ADB initiated key sector reforms in 2000. Power sector reforms \nwere  part  of  the  Accelerating  Economic  Transformation  Program  in  2008  and  2009. 12 The \nlessons  from  the  ESRP  are:  (i)  linking  program  conditions  where  ADB  has  a  strong  position, \n(ii) providing  extensive  long-term  support  through  technical  assistance  and  policy  dialogue  for \ndifficult reforms, (iii) privatizing state-owned enterprises instead of just unbundling, (iv) reducing \n                                                \n9  Receivables owed by private customers totaled $2.6 billion or 1.14% of GDP in 2013, whereas receivables owed \nby  provincial  and  federal  government  customers  increased  by  7%  from  2008  to  2013  and  totaled  $1.5  billion  or \n0.66% of GDP in 2013.  See Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n10 ADB's  ongoing  portfolio  in  the  energy  sector  is  $2.6  billion.  The  total  multitranche  financing  facility  amount  is \n$2.9 billion. The government has requested new multitranche financing facilities for transmission and distribution. \n11 Membership  consists  of  the  government  and  26  donors,  including  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  France, \nGermany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States.

Manila. \n\n         \n\n\fsubsidies as a crucial step, (v) staying engaged, and (vi) reducing electricity theft.13 The ESRP \nreform  was  successful  in  establishing  NEPRA,  but  did  not  include  or  follow  on  with  direct \nmeasures  to  eliminate  subsidies  or  to  maintain  the  cost-recovery  tariff.  The  power  sector \ncompanies  were  unbundled  under  the  ESRP,  but  have  not  become  independent  commercial \ncompanies  and  were  not  privatized.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  recommends \npursuing structural reforms through sector-specific initiatives using a programmatic approach.  \n \n12. \nLink  to  country  partnership  strategy.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  priorities  of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2009\u20132013  for  Pakistan\u2014policy  reforms  and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector. 14  The  program  is  included  in  the  country \noperations  business  plan  (COBP),  2014\u20132016  for  Pakistan.15 ADB\u2019s  forthcoming  CPS,  2014\u2013\n2018  for  Pakistan  envisages  a  focus  on  contributions  that  will  strengthen  the  energy  sector, \nconsistent  with  ADB  priorities  such  as  inclusive  growth.  The  energy  sector  is  a  barrier  to \neconomic growth, adequate job creation, and macroeconomic sustainability. It will play a central \nrole in the new CPS, supporting energy policy reforms and structural transformation. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  a  sustainable  energy  sector  that  supports  economic \n\n13. \ngrowth. The outcome will be a reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy system.  \n \nC. \n\n \nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe program consists of five annual subprograms that support the government\u2019s reform \ninitiatives as outlined in the power policy, and specifically cover medium- to long-term issues in \nthree areas: (i) managing tariff and subsidies with revised and updated policies and guidelines \nto create a self-sustaining tariff regime, (ii) improving energy sector performance and the market \nenvironment to encourage participation by private entities, and (iii) increasing accountability and \ntransparency through public disclosure on the progress of the  reforms and the performance of \nsector  participants.  The  program  is  expected  to  encourage  investments  and  provide  the  basis \nfor  dynamic  policymaking  and  regulatory  improvements  with  the  objective  to  make  the  sector \nself-sustainable. 16 All  10  policy  conditions  for  subprogram  1  were  met  by  31  March  2014. \nSubprogram 1 outputs are as follows: \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Managing  tariffs  and  subsidies.  The  objectives  of  this  output  are  to  have \n(i) clear  policies  on  tariffs  and  subsidies  targeted  at  low-income  customers,  (ii)  policy \nimplementation  through  NEPRA  rules  and  guidelines,  (iii)  reduction  of  discretionary  policy \ndecisions and lags in tariff approval and implementation, and (iv) limits to power sector arrears. \nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the National Power Tariff and Subsidy \nPolicy  Guidelines  on  28  January  2014.17 The guidelines  set  out  the short-,  medium-  and long-\n\n                                                \n13 The program was rated less than successful, but was considered relevant as support to the economy.    \n    ADB. 2013.

The amendments to Penal \nCode 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedures 1898 have been enacted through Presidential ordinance, which \nwill  be  submitted  to  the  Parliament  for  ratification  (IMF  structural  benchmark).  Utility  courts  will  be  established \nunder the amendment. A new electricity act to modernize governance of the sector is being drafted.   \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nterm goals on subsidies and tariffs, and the principles of reform in designing new guidelines for \nNEPRA.  The  NEPRA  determination  process,  including  the  introduction  of  a  multiyear  tariff \nmechanism and automatic fuel price adjustments every quarter, will assist the timely application \nof a full cost-recovery tariff. The DISCOs will be requested to submit periodic investment plans \nin  advance,  along  with  their  respective  tariff  petitions,  to  fast-track  the  determination  process. \nClear  third-party  access  guidelines  and  tariffs  will  be  fully  disclosed  and  updated.  The \ngovernment  will  develop  a mechanism  to  monitor  and  limit  the  accumulation  of  unpaid  bills  to \nthe power generation companies. The government will eliminate subsidies by 2016, except for \nthose to low-income customers who consume up to 200 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per \nmonth.  Identification  of  these  customers  and  subsequent  implementation  of  the  subsidy \npayment scheme will be developed based on a study that reviews alternative payment options \nas  well  as  existing  mechanisms  such  as  the  Benazir  Income  Support  Programme.  As  the \ngovernment intends to maintain a uniform national tariff, the guidelines establish the principles \nfor  tariff  equalization  via  an  interregional  subsidy.  NEPRA's  draft  guidelines  on  DISCO  tariff \ndetermination were posted on its website for public consultation in February 2014.18  The draft \nguidelines  specify  the  methodologies,  timetable,  formula,  and  procedures  for  DISCO  tariff \ndetermination. \n \n16. \nOutput  2:  Improving  sector  performance  and  market  access  for  private  sector \nparticipation.19 Market-oriented  reform  will  be  put  in  place  to  increase  efficiencies  of  public \nsector  power  companies  and  encourage  private  sector  participation.  The  objectives  are:  (i) to \nreduce losses and improve tariff collection by DISCOs, (ii) improve demand-side efficiency and \nstrengthen  energy  conservation,  (iii)  manage  generation  costs  through  least-cost  plans  and \nensure their implementation, (iv) increase gas supply and open the market to direct contracting \nbetween  producers  and  large  consumers,  (v)  commercialize  public  sector  power  companies,20 \nand  (vi)  institutionalize  CPPA\u2019s  commercial  operations.  Both  loss  reduction  and  better  tariff \ncollection by DISCOs are critical to their performance and sustainability. For subprogram 1, the \nMinistry  of  Water  and  Power  instructed  four  DISCOs  to  outsource  collection  to  the  private \nsector, and instructed all DISCOs to implement a revenue protection program that will improve \ncollection.  A  mechanism  was  submitted  and  discussed  at  the  Council  of  Common  Interests  to \nautomatically  deduct  overdue  provincial  government  customer  electricity  bills  from  the  federal \ngovernment allocation to the provinces. The federal government customers has been informed \nthat  bills  exceeding  90  days  will  be  automatically  deducted  from  their  budget  allocations  and \ndirectly  paid  to  the  DISCOs.  The  government\u2019s  commitment  to  reduce  generation  costs  by \nadjusting  the  fuel  mix  will  be  manifest  in  the  implementation  of  a  long-term,  least-cost \ngeneration  and  transmission  expansion  plan.21 For  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  issued \ninstructions for the least-cost plan to take into account energy security and all associated costs, \nincluding social, environmental, and climate change risk mitigation measures. The government \nwill  also  expedite  the  implementation  of  the  Petroleum  Exploration  and  Production  Policy  of \n2012  and  its  subsequent  amendments  to  enable  a  market-oriented  gas  sector. 22  The \ngovernment will encourage more gas production through incentives such as pricing regimes and \nclear  disclosure  of  concession  agreements  and  application  progress.  The  2013  Model \n\n                                                \n18 Although  not  a  structural  benchmark, \n\n(http://www.nepra.org.pk/Draft/Guidelines \n%20For%20Determination%20of%20Consumer-end%20Tariff(Methodology%20&Process).pdf) \nbeen \nincluded in the letter of intent of the government for the IMF\u2019s EFF, with a targeted promulgation date of April 2014.  \n19 The  program  will  focus  on  enhancing  an  enabling  environment  and  commercializing  state-owned  companies  for \nprivatization. A program loan for state-owned enterprise reform, which includes privatization, is being prepared. \n\nthe  NEPRA  guidelines \n\n20  Commercializing the DISCOs will help achieve the government's privatization targets. \n21 Environmental and social risk mitigation costs will be included in the calculations.  \n22 Government  of  Pakistan.  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources.  2012.  Petroleum  Exploration  and \n\nhave \n\nProduction Policy 2012. Islamabad.  \n\n         \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthe \n\nline  with \n\nPetroleum  Concession  Agreement  was  published  on  the  website  of  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum \nand Natural Resources. Petroleum exploration blocks for the 2013 bidding round were awarded \nand  three  pricing  notifications  were  issued  by  the  Oil  and  Gas  Regulatory  Authority  under  the \n2012 Petroleum Policy.  \n \n17. \nTo  ensure  accountability  and  promote  higher  efficiency,  all  GENCOs  and  DISCOs,  as \nwell  as  the  National  Transmission  Despatch  Company,  will  enter  into  performance  contracts \nwith  the  government.  Key  performance  indicators  will  be  disclosed  to  the  public.  For \nIMF\u2013EFF \nsubprogram 1, three DISCOs have signed performance contracts.  In \nstructural  benchmark  for  the  institutionalization  of  the  CPPA,  subprogram  1  sets  out  the \noperational  framework  for  the  CPPA.  The  CPPA  will  act  as  a  single  buyer  on  behalf  of  the \nDISCOs,  enforce  contracts  and  transactions,  and  ensure  invoicing  and  payment.  This  will \nincrease credibility especially for debt repayment. The memorandum and articles of association \nwas amended to establish CPPA as an agent to purchase electricity on behalf of the DISCOs. In \npreparation  of  new  power  purchase  agreements  between  the  CPPA  and  the  GENCOs,  the \nCPPA has, on behalf of the DISCOs, entered into a heads of agreements with GENCO Holding \nCompany.  The  heads  of  agreements  includes  the  key  principles  of  the  new  power  purchase \nagreements. The target is for trading between bulk suppliers and buyers to begin by latest 2018. \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Achieving  accountability  and  transparency.  Better  access  will  foster \ndemand for information and a culture of transparency. Subprogram 1 sets out a mechanism to \nincrease public access to energy sector information. The government will implement web-based \nopen  access  to  merit  order  dispatch  and  daily  payment  information  for  the  power  generation \ncompanies  to  reinforce prioritization  based  on  economic  rationale.  Subsidy  information  is  now \nincluded  in  each  customer's  bill  to  raise  awareness  of  the  amount  of  subsidies  that  the \ngovernment  provides.  The  DISCOs  also  publish  monthly  billing  and  collection  data  on  their \nwebsites,  including  arrears  aggregated  by  customer  category.  To  monitor  power  policy \nimplementation  and  NEPRA\u2019s  performance,  the  ECC  has  instructed  the  Ministry  of Water  and \nPower  and  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources  to  set  up  monitoring  units  that \nreport  quarterly  to  the  ECC  on  implementation  progress.  The  two  ministries  will  also  appoint \nindependent  and  internationally  respected  experts  to  review  the  quarterly  reports  and  make \nrecommendations. The reports and recommendations will be made public on a timely basis.23  \n \n19. \nSubsequent  subprograms. Subprogram 1 sets out a clear framework and establishes \na solid foundation for future reforms. Policy conditions for subsequent subprograms will ensure \nthat  the  implementation  of  reform  measures  initiated  under  subprogram  1  continues.  The \nprogram requires flexibility  in all subsequent subprograms to reflect any changes in Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy, political situation, or other circumstances.   \n \n20. \nSubprogram 2 has 10 indicative policy conditions that cover all three reform areas  and \nare  to  be  completed  by  January  2015.  Subprogram  2  actions  are  expected  to  include  the \nfollowing: (i) Output 1: notification of guidelines for tariff determination, publication of information \non payment arrears, and a mechanism to keep the level of payment arrears capped; (ii) Output \n2:  reclassification  and  provisioning  by  DISCOs  of  receivables  from  customers;  issuance  of \nregulations  on  minimum  energy  performance  standards  and  appliance  labeling;  notification  of \nrules  for  stepping  up  gas  production;  signing  of  performance  contracts  between  Ministry  of \nWater and Power and industry participants, signing of energy supply agreements between the \nCPPA  and  each  DISCO,  signing  (by  the  CPPA  on  behalf  the  DISCOs)  of  power  purchase \n\n                                                \n23 The review and recommendations of the advisors will be a part of the report but will not be edited by the relevant \n\nauthorities. The report will be disclosed to the public after the ECC meeting.  \n\n\f7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nagreements with generation companies, and signing of an agreement between WAPDA and the \nCPPA  on  the  administration  of  IPPs\u2019  power  purchase  agreements;  and  (iii)  Output  3: \nimplementation  of  web-based  access  to  information  on  amounts  due  to  and  payments  by \nindustry  participants,  and  publication  of  information  by  industry  participants  on  achievement of \nselected performance standards and indicators. \n \n21. \nSubprograms  3  to  5  are  intended  to  continue  to  build  on  the  reforms  begun  under \nsubprograms  1  and  2,  with  indicative  policy  actions  in  each  of  the  three  reform  areas  to  be \ncarried out by January of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Indicative policy actions for subprograms 3\u20135 \ninclude the following: (i) Output 1: determination of multiyear tariffs; (ii) Output 2: implementation \nof  revenue  protection  programs  by  DISCOs  and  notification  of  national  energy  standards; \nestablishment  of  a  steering  committee  on  national  energy  conservation  policy;  implementation \nof a restructuring plan for mid- and downstream gas operations; and implementation of a long-\nterm,  least-cost  generation  and  transmission  expansion  plan;  and  (iii)  Output  3:  publication  of \nkey indicators under the power sector performance contracts, and of a review of compliance by \npower sector companies with licensing provisions; and disclosure of operational audit reports.             \n \nD. \n \n22. \nSubprogram 1 comprises a single-tranche loan of SDR257,443,000. Subprograms 2 and \n3,  with  a  loan of  $150 million  equivalent  each, and subprograms  4  and  5,  with  a loan  of  $250 \nmillion equivalent each, are all subject to further discussions between ADB and the government, \nand to the availability of Asian Development Fund resources. Subsequent subprograms will be \nsubmitted  for  ADB  Board  consideration  upon  completion of  the  policy  triggers.  Financing from \nordinary  capital  resources  and  from  cofinanciers  on  a  parallel  cofinancing  basis  may  be \nconsidered. The World Bank  is  expected  to  provide  cofinancing for the first  ($600 million)  and \nsecond  subprograms.24 The  policy  matrix  (Appendix  4)  lists  actions  to  be  taken  prior  to  Board \nconsideration for subprogram 1, and proposed policy actions for subsequent subprograms. The \ngovernment  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR257,443,000  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement. The programmatic approach will support reforms outlined in the development policy \nletter  (Appendix  3)  and  policy  matrix.  The  amount  is  determined  by  the  significance  of  the \nenergy sector to the overall economy, the expected development impact of the policy package \nbased on its strength, and Pakistan\u2019s development financing needs. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n23. \nThe  ECC  will  oversee  and  is  the  final  government  authority  on  the  reforms  (para.  22). \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  program\u2019s  executing  agency,  supported  by  the  program \ncoordination  unit  (PCU).  The  PCU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  program \nmonitoring and reporting. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and the Ministry of \nWater and Power will be the implementing agencies, supported by their monitoring units. Each \nmonitoring  unit  will  be  responsible  for  program  reporting  and  discussing  implementing  issues \nwith the PCU. The monitoring units will submit quarterly reports to the ECC. The report will be \n\n                                                \n24 The one development policy letter was issued for all cofinancing institutions. The policy matrix may differ because \nof the different duration of support and timing of prior actions for subprogram 1. The policy matrix was developed \nthrough  joint  missions  by  cofinancing  institutions  to  ensure  consistency  in  policy  advice  and  to  avoid  partial \nimplementation of reforms by dividing the prior conditions between the institutions.  \n\n         \n\n\fprovided to ADB.25 Technical assistance to support the program will be provided by ADB, Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  the \nWorld  Bank,  and  other  donors  through  their  ongoing  and  new  initiatives.  ADB  is  processing  a \ntechnical assistance loan for state-owned enterprise reforms, which will provide support for the \nPCU and the monitoring units.26 The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Pakistan \nin  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.27 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  The \nimplementation period for the program is from October 2013 to June 2018. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n24. \nThe proposed policy reforms under the program will contribute to the national economy \nby  (i)  reducing  the  subsidies  for  the  power  sector,  (ii)  increasing  investment,  production,  and \nemployment as a result of more reliable electricity, and (iii) lowering production and distribution \ncosts.  The  electricity  supply  has  increased  after  the  government  injected  liquidity  in  June  and \nJuly  2013  to  pay  overdue  bills  from  DISCOs  through  the  CPPA  to  the  power  suppliers. \nHowever,  new  payment  arrears  have  accumulated,  totaling  PRs200  billion  as  of  the  end  of \nDecember 2013.28 Removing administrative barriers, reducing costs, and introducing automatic \nadjustment mechanisms for government bills will help eliminate the need for subsidies. A least-\ncost  based  fuel  mix  and  market-oriented  commercial  system  will  lower  costs  and  ease  the \nburden  on  customers.  Payment  arrears  will  also  decline  if  collection  improves,  if  DISCOs \nimprove their performance and stem system losses, and if the government pays the remaining \nsubsidies  on  time.  Reliability  of  power  supply  will  be  restored,  thereby  providing  energy  that \nsupports  economic  growth.  Subprogram  1  will  generate  economic  benefits  by  establishing  a \npolicy  framework  for  medium-  to  long-term  reforms.  It  will  also  effect  immediate  changes  to \nadministrative procedures to increase sector revenues and efficiency and lower operating costs. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance   \n\n25. \nIn  line  with  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  a  governance, \ninstitutional, and corruption risk assessment is being conducted as part of the preparation of the \nCPS  for  Pakistan  in  2014.  As  indicated  in  the  draft  assessment,  Pakistan\u2019s  score  for  various \ngovernance indicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made \nprogress  in  improving  accountability,  increasing  transparency,  and  raising  efficiency.  The \ngovernment  has  embarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework, \nincluding budget management, financial accounting, and reporting and expenditure controls. As \npart of the IMF\u2013EFF, the government has changed the tax policy to increase transparency. The \nrecent focus  has been  on  capacity  building  and training  at  the federal  and provincial  levels.  A \nfiduciary risk assessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to \nhigh  despite  the  progress  observed  within  individual  public  expenditure  and  financial \n\n                                                \n25 The monitoring framework is included in the Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents   \n    in Appendix 2). \n26 Analytical, technical, legal, regulatory, and communications support for the program's duration will be provided.  \n27 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n28 Payment arrears increased from PRs105 billion in 2008 to PRs461 billion in 2012 and then fell to PRs90 billion in \nJuly 2013. See Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\naccountability assessment areas. Even with the installation of SAP enterprise resource planning \nsoftware and the introduction of a chief finance and account officer in line ministries as internal \nauditor,  internal  control  and  audit  remain  weak,  as  does  the  legislative  oversight  over  budget \nformulation  and  execution.  Although  the  institutional  setup  for  public  procurement  has  been \nestablished,  not  enough  efforts  have  been  made  to  augment  the  capacity  of  and  the  budget \nallocations  to  these  authorities.  To  support  the  government  in  public  financial  management \nreforms,  ongoing \nfinanced  by  various  donors  should  be  coordinated  and \ncomplementary. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government.  The  government  is  acting  against  corruption,  which  includes \nongoing  monitoring  and  reporting  work  by  the  public  accounts  committee  of  the  Parliament. \nApproximately PRs138 billion was recovered between July 2008 and February 2013.   \n\ninitiatives \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nC. \n\n26. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  will  accelerate  economic  growth  and  help \ncreate  jobs,  which  are  keys  to  reducing  poverty.  Reliable  power  will  benefit  the  poor  and \nvulnerable consumers,  including  hospitals  and schools,  who  are  hard  hit  by  inadequate  power \nsupply, load shedding, and poor power quality. Small industries will be able to operate for more \nhours  per  day  and  thereby  increase  productivity,  which  in  turn  will  create  more  work \nopportunities for the  poor. Increases in  the  Human  Development  Index  are strongly  correlated \nwith  access  to  commercial  electricity  supplies.  The  indirect  benefits  of  reliable  energy  supply \ninclude reduced work time, and better health of household members by reducing fume-related \nindoor pollution and water- and food-borne diseases by refrigeration and boiling water and food. \n  \nD. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n27. \nThe  program  has  been  assessed  as  category  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples, and category B for environment. In the event of any unanticipated adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS)  will  be \napplied in its entirety and the loan  will be recategorized. An environmental assessment for the \nentire  program  found  that  the  policy  action  requiring  the  government  to  prepare  a  least-cost \ngeneration  and  transmission  plan  may  have  future  impacts  on  the  environment  if  not \nappropriately managed.29 The covenants in the loan agreement include carrying out a strategic \nenvironmental assessment and making sure that any identified long-term environmental impact \nis  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  (2009).  If  other  policy  actions  are  added  to \nsubsequent  tranches,  safeguard  due  diligence  will  be  done  to  confirm  or  change  the \ncategorization. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n28.

The Ministry of Finance will act as the \ncoordinator for the various government entities and for transparency \nmeasures.  \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to further strengthen the regulator\u2019s \ncapacity and to continue monitoring the performance of PSEs will \nincrease accountability in the sector and improve overall governance.  \nThe program is based on government\u2019s own policy and reform initiative \nand is backed by a strong political will and commitment, supported by \nthe donor community through technical assistance where needed.  \nTransparency measures and information and education campaigns will \nhelp the stakeholders understand how the reforms benefit them. \n\nLack of accountability because of weak \ncorporate governance among energy \nsector PSEs. \nLegislative process may be slow and \nface resistance by vested interests, and \nlegislations may not be promulgated. \nReforms stall because of reluctance of \nstakeholders. \nPSE = public sector enterprise. \na The ratio\u2019s level is stipulated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act 2005. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n29. \nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  subprogram  1  implementation  shall  conform  to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the loan \ndocuments.
