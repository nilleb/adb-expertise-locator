The \ninvestment program supports the following government objectives: ensuring water availability to \nwater  users;  providing  water  in  adequate  quantities  with  improved  management;  enhancing \nproductivity and water user efficiency; addressing the spatial variation of water availability; and \naddressing  climate  change  and  disaster  vulnerability,  as  described  in  the  Public  Investment \nProgramme 2017\u20132020.3 The outcome will be secured access to water resources for agricultural \nand drinking purposes in project areas.   \n\nOn  24  June  2015,  the  Board  approved  the  provision  of  loans  to  Sri  Lanka  under  a \n3. \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $453 million equivalent to be implemented between \nJuly  2015  and  December  2024.  The  MFF  comprises  three  tranches  and  uses  the  time-slicing \napproach  to  achieve  the  outputs:  (i)  new  and  improved  water  conveyance  and  storage \ninfrastructure  constructed; (ii) systems for  improving  water resources management  productivity \ndeveloped that will formulate future investments to improve water and crop productivity of existing \nirrigation  systems  within  the  investment  program  beneficiary  areas;  and  (iii) multidisciplinary \ninvestment  program  management  operational  to  timely  and  economical  implementation  of  the \nMFF. Output 1 of the MFF is implementing three physical projects:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe Upper Elahera Canal Project (UECP), comprising about 101 kilometers (km) \nof water conveyance infrastructure linking the existing reservoirs at Kalu Ganga, \nMoragahakanda,  Huruluwewa,  Eruwewa,  and  Mahakanadara,  which  supply \nexisting irrigation and town supply schemes; \n\nthe North Western Province Canal Project  (NWPCP), which will construct about \n91 km of new and rehabilitated conveyance channels and two new reservoirs at \nMahakithula and Mahakirula  to transfer  water from the  Dambula  Oya  River  and \nWemedilla reservoir to supply existing irrigation and town supply schemes; and  \n\nthe Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project, which will increase storage in \nits  head  reservoir  and  rehabilitate  about  74  km  of  existing  canals  to  improve \nconveyance  and  reliability  of  service  to  existing  farmers.  This  project  is  fully \nfinanced under tranche 1.  \n\n4. \n\n Tranche 2 will have two outputs: (i) completion of new and improved water conveyance \n\n                                                \n1   ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing  Facility  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Mahaweli  Water  Security  Investment \nProgram.

Output  1  includes  construction  of  about  21  km  (out  of  101  km)  of  conveyance \nchannels under the UECP and the continuation of construction activities under the NWPCP.4 The \ntranche  2  periodic  financing  request  report  summarizes  the  background  to  and  status  of  the \ninvestment  program.  It  also  presents  a  summary  of  the  tranche  2  activities  and review  of  due \ndiligence and relevant approval processes and recommendations.5 \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \n\n5. \nThe proposed tranche project is classified under environmental impact category A under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (footnote  1).  Separate  environmental  impact \nassessments  (EIAs)  were  prepared  for  the  UECP  and  the  NWPCP.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared for the Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation Project. \n\n6. \nThe UECP EIA was prepared in 2014 and was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in January \n2015 prior to Board approval of the MFF. About 95% of the channel trace under tranche 2 falls \nwithin the jurisdiction of either the Department of Wildlife Conservation or the Forest Department. \nThe  main  impacts  include  (i)  generation  of  waste  material  comprising  tunnel  spoil  requiring \ndisposal (about 27 hectares); (ii) land clearance for construction of access and ventilation shafts \nto the tunnels, and temporary and permanent access roads; and (iii) other construction-related \nimpacts such as vibration, noise and dust. The tunnel spoil can be reused for road construction; \nnevertheless, temporary disposal sites are required. Due to design changes made during detailed \ndesign conducted under tranche 1, there is a slight increase in tunnel spoil as compared to that \ndocumented in the EIA. Thus, new spoil disposal sites have been identified and additional access \nroads are planned, including widening or rehabilitation of 12 km of existing roads and construction \nof 2 km of new access roads. The environmental impacts of these design changes are addressed \nin an addendum to the EIA, which included additional ecological surveys. The EIA addendum, \nwith updated environmental management plans, was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 11 October \n2017.6 The semi-annual environmental safeguard monitoring reports are also publicly disclosed. \n\n7. \nUnder tranche 1,  all  environmental  safeguard requirements  are  being  addressed  in the \ndesigns of the new infrastructure, and are being monitored during implementation, including by: \n(i) constructing tunnels in lieu of cut-and-cover canals to minimize impacts on forest and wildlife \nreserves,  (ii)  applying  contract-specific  environmental  management  plans,  (iii)  holding  several \ntraining and awareness programs for the executing agency and contractor\u2019s environmental staff, \nand  (iv) identifying  and  translocating  priority  species  based  on  detailed  ecological  surveys. \nStakeholders  have  been  consulted  during  planning  and  design  of  the  project,  no  safeguards-\nrelated  complaints  have  been  received  to  date,  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  in \noperation  under  tranche  1  will  continue  under  tranche  2.  Environmental  safeguards  are  being \nmanaged  satisfactorily  under  tranche  1,  and  the  Ministry  of  Mahaweli  Development  and \nEnvironment  has  demonstrated  it  can  manage  the  environmental  safeguards  satisfactorily.  An \nindependent environmental monitor also has been engaged. \n\nIV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nThe President recommends that the Board authorize the conversion of $210 million into a \n\n8. \ntranche to finance project 2 of Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program in Sri Lanka.  \n                                                \n4   Specifically, tranche 2 will finance (i) partial construction of a 28 km tunnel; (ii) partial construction of about 8.8 km of \nnew  tunnels  and  channels;  (iii)  continuing  construction  of  the  Mahakithula  and  Mahakirula  Reservoirs,  and \nMahakithula Inlet Tunnel that will be initiated under tranche 1; and (iv) project management recurring costs. \n\n5   Periodic Financing Request Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix). \n6   Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix \n\n3 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/LinkedDocs/?id=47381-005-MFF Tranche Report \n \n\nPeriodic Financing Request Report \n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: Upper Elahera Canal Project  \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 October 2017) \n \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0065  \nSLRS153.38 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nEIA \nkm \nMDP \nMFF \nNWPCP \nUECP \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \nenvironmental impact assessment \nkilometers \nMahaweli Development Program \nmultitranche financing facility \nNorth West Province Canal Project \nUpper Elahera Canal Project \n", "NOTES \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to United States dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "Peer reviewers \n", "Wencai Zhang, Operations 1 \nHun Kim, South Asia Department (SARD) \nMio Oka, Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division, \nSARD \n \nLance Gore, Senior Water Resources Specialist, SARD \nNishanti Manjula Amerasinghe, Project Management Specialist, SARD \nK.M.
