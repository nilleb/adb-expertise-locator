The loan will be used to finance two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating solar and wind \nprojects  in  Thailand  (the  Nakornsawan  Solar  Power  Project  and  the  Hanuman  Wind  Power \nProject), as well as Energy Absolute\u2019s ongoing investment in a comprehensive electric vehicle \ncharging network (EVCN) in Thailand. This green loan1 is expected to be the first certified climate \nloan  in  Thailand2 and  one  of  the  first  in  Asia.  The  assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will support Thailand\u2019s renewable energy sector, increase awareness about green loans, \nand support the transition from a conventional automotive industry to an electric vehicle industry \nin  Thailand  by  establishing  a  comprehensive  EVCN  across  Thailand\u2019s  major  cities.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  will  also  support  a  leading  clean  energy  and  sustainable  transport  company  in \nThailand at a time when capital markets are still adjusting to the ongoing disruptions caused by \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. ADB has built strong relationships with key participants in the Thai \nenergy and transport sectors since 2009. ADB supported Energy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond \nissuance  in  2019,3 and  has  been  discussing the company\u2019s  ongoing  sustainable  transport  and \nclean energy plans. Energy Absolute is a climate and green investment leader in the region and \nthe company sees ADB as a valuable partner to support their strategy. Energy Absolute\u2019s strategy \nis  strongly  aligned  with  Thailand\u2019s  industrial,  climate  and  electric  mobility  targets,  and  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 commitments to climate mitigation.4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n4. \nADB has increased its efforts to promote green financial instruments, such as green bonds \nand  loans.  Green  loans  help  to  provide  a  mechanism  for  financing  investments  in  green  and \nclimate-smart  projects  that  are  aligned  with  the  Paris  Agreement  on  climate  change  and  the \nUnited Nations\u2019 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Green Loan Principles5 (GLP) \nsupport  the  promotion  of  environmentally  sustainable  lending  practices.  Green  loans  can  be \ncertified as climate loans under the Climate Bonds Standard and Certification Scheme (footnote \n2) which is the most prominent labelling scheme for green bonds and green loans globally, and \nis designed to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well \nunder 2\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n1  A  green  loan  is  a  loan  used  to  finance  or  re-finance,  in  whole  or  in  part,  new  and/or  existing  projects  with \n\nenvironmental benefits. Climate loans are focused on climate change benefits in particular. \n\n2  Certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative. https://www.climatebonds.net/certification. \n3  ADB. Thailand. Energy Absolute Green Bond for Wind Power Project. \n4  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n5  The  Green  Loan  Principles  were  developed  by  the  Loan  Market  Association,  the  Asia  Pacific  Loan  Market \nAssociation and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, based on the Green Bond Principles developed by \nthe International Capital Market Association. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n \n5. \nAlthough the global market for green bonds has grown rapidly, green loans have remained \na relatively less well-known instrument. The project will contribute to the greening of Thailand\u2019s \nfinance markets by showcasing international best practice approaches to green loan verification \nand certification. This green loan is expected to be the first certified climate loan in Thailand. \n \n6. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  has  been  increasing  its  focus  on  sectors \nother  than  energy.  Transport  is  typically  a  significant  contributor  to  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions.  The  transport  sector  makes  up  around  26%  of  Thailand\u2019s  annual  GHG  emissions. \nElectrification of vehicles and decarbonization of the transport sector are widely seen as a critical \nchallenge to meet commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Electric vehicles can help to \nreduce transport sector GHG emissions while reducing local air pollution. Thailand is aiming to \nbecome a regional leader in electric vehicles with long-term targets to substantially increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles on Thailand\u2019s roads and expand public charging infrastructure. \n \n7. \nProject description. The Project entails a corporate loan of up to B1.5 billion with a 3-\nyear  tenor  to  support  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  ongoing  renewable  energy  and  sustainable  transport \nactivities during a time when the company faces increased uncertainty with debt raising due to \nCOVID-19. The loan will be used for the financing of two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating solar and \nwind projects in Thailand (the Nakornsawan Solar Power Project and the Hanuman Wind Power \nProject),  as  well  as  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  establish  a  comprehensive  EVCN  in \nThailand. Thailand has long-term ambitions to be an electric vehicle hub of Southeast Asia and \nEnergy Absolute is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector, with plans to develop battery and \nelectric vehicle manufacturing capacity as well as a comprehensive EVCN in Thailand comprising \nat least 3,600 charging stations by 2023. \n \n8. \nBorrower.

The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a direct material \nimpact  on  the  projects  this  proposed  loan  will  support.  However,  the  pandemic  has  caused \nincreased  uncertainty  regarding  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  ongoing  capital  raising  efforts,  which  led \nEnergy  Absolute  to  seek  ADB  assistance  for  a  portion  of  their  2020  financing  requirements. \nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic is not expected to impact project costs or implementation, the \ncontinued operation and viability of Thailand\u2019s renewable energy power projects, and investment \ninto a comprehensive EVCN, will help ensure Thailand\u2019s continued progress towards its long-\nterm emissions reduction targets. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) Thailand\u2019s finance sector \nbecomes more green,8 and (ii) Thailand\u2019s automotive industry transitioned to an electric vehicle \nindustry.9 \n \n16. \nOutcome.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  is  sustainable  funding  of  business  expansion  and \ncontinuity  of  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  clean  energy  investments  enabled.  This  includes  a  green  loan \ncertified  as  a  climate  loan  by  the  Climate  Bonds  Initiative,  underscoring  the  company\u2019s \ncommitment to sustainability. \n \nOutputs.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  establishment  of  an  EVCN \n17. \ncompleted,  (ii)  climate  loan  verification  report  submitted  and  financing  of  existing  operating \nrenewable energy projects achieved, and (iii) gender equality improved. \n \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n \n\n7  ADB. 2003.

Bangkok. \n\n\f5 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nC. \n \n18. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which targets that 75% of ADB operations should support climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030, and that ADB assistance for climate finance total $80 billion \nduring  2019\u20132030  (footnote  4).  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  also  promotes  the  expansion  of  private \nsector operations into sustainable transport and urban transport. ADB\u2019s support for the project is \nalso in line with its country partnership strategy (2013\u20132016),10 and country operations business \nplan  (2020\u20132022) 11  for  Thailand,  which  promote  private  sector  development,  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  environmentally  sustainable  development.  The  proposed  project  also  aligns \nwith the forthcoming country partnership strategy 2021\u20132025 for Thailand, which will emphasize \nsustainable and resilient growth, and the role of non-sovereign operations. \n \n19. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.12 \n \n20. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  department  has \nsupported  a  number  of  renewable  energy  projects  and  climate  aligned  financings  in  Thailand, \nincluding ADB\u2019s first loan to Energy Absolute for the Energy Absolute Green Bond for Wind Power \nProject in 2019 (footnote 3).13 ADB can play a valuable role in assisting with the certification of \ngreen  financial  products  such  as  loans  and  bonds.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  such  projects  can \nprovide strong market validation and help increase awareness of climate aligned investments. As \nADB\u2019s first private sector EVCN investment, the project will also contribute to important lessons \nfor future electric mobility opportunities across Asia and the Pacific. \n \nD. \n \nThe project entails a B1.5 billion non-amortizing corporate loan with a tenor of 3 years and \n21. \na bullet repayment. The loan proceeds will be used to finance two of Energy Absolute\u2019s operating \nrenewable  power  projects,  and  to  support  the  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  EVCN  in \nThailand.

As  of  May  2020, \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s management has overseen the successful development and operation of \nsix renewable energy plants with a total installed capacity of 664 MW. It is also developing \na  lithium-ion  battery  factory  in  Thailand,  electric  cars,  electric  ferries,  and  associated \ncharging infrastructure. \nEnergy  Absolute  sells  electricity  to  EGAT  under  the  SPP  program.  Revenue  is  fully \ncontracted,  with  long-term  PPAs  with  creditworthy  offtakers.  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  electric \nvehicle  charging  stations are  located  in prime  locations  in  partnership  with various major \npartners, mostly in malls, residential estates, office buildings, hospitals, convenience stores, \nand gas stations. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nEnergy Absolute\u2019s green loan will be certified as a climate loan under the CBS and will also \nadhere to the GLP. To obtain CBS certification, the underlying projects must comply with \nthe relevant sector criteria. For this project, it is expected that the financing will comply with \nthe following sector criteria under the CBS; low carbon transport; solar energy; wind energy. \nTo maintain climate loan certification under the CBS, the company will need to provide an \nannual monitoring report to (i) confirm that it has not disposed of or otherwise refinanced the \nunderlying  asset  and  (ii)  present  the  operational  performance  of  the  projects  such  as \nmegawatt-hours  of  renewable  energy  generation  delivered  or  total  kWh  of  electricity \nprovided through the charging network. \nThe  company  will  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements  and  annual  audited \nfinancial statements on a consolidated basis. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nCBS  =  Climate  Bonds  Standard;  EGAT  =  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand;  Energy  Absolute  =  Energy \nAbsolute  Public  Company  Limited;  GLP  =  Green  Loan  Principles;  kWh  =  kilowatt-hour;  MW  =  megawatt;  O&M  = \noperation and maintenance; PPA = power purchase agreement; SPP = small power producer. \nSource: Energy Absolute Public Company Limited. \n\n \nF. \n \n24. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB  will  provide  debt  financing  to  Energy  Absolute  in  the  form  of  a  non-amortizing \ncorporate loan of up to B1.5 billion (or its equivalent in United States dollars) with a 3-year tenor \nand  a  bullet  repayment.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  financing  and  operation  of  two  of \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s renewable power projects and the establishment of a comprehensive EVCN in \n\n14 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nThailand. ADB will also ensure that the loan will be recognized as a certified climate loan. This is \nexpected to be the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified climate loan in Thailand from only the \nsecond issuer of a certified climate loan in Asia. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s participation in the transaction will ensure that the loan will comply with the Green \nLoan Principles (footnote 5) and will be certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative under the Climate \nBonds Standard and Certification Scheme as a climate loan (footnote 2). Green loans are even \nless  well  recognized  than  green  bonds,  and  ADB\u2019s  support  will  help  make  the  climate  finance \nbenefits of certified climate loans better known in the region. Obtaining climate loan certification \nwill help contribute to greater awareness of the potential to align the finance sector with the Paris \nAgreement,  and  the  United  Nations\u2019  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will support the continued operation of Energy Absolute\u2019s existing renewable energy \npower projects, which provide zero GHG-emission electricity to the Thai grid. This is especially \nimportant  during  a  highly  uncertain  time  in  which  the  company  is  facing  increased  uncertainty \nraising debt and is seeking to diversify funding sources. ADB\u2019s assistance will also support the \nimplementation  of  what  will  be  one  of  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  largest  EVCNs.  Energy  Absolute\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  complies  with  ADB  standards  and  will \npromote higher standards for the supported projects. \n \n27. \nSupport during COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s involvement will help Energy Absolute at a \ntime  when  financial markets  and  banks  are  adjusting to  the ongoing  impacts  of the  COVID-19 \npandemic. The pandemic has caused increased uncertainty for Energy Absolute\u2019s capital raising. \n \n28. \nElectric  vehicle  charging  network.  The  project  will  be  the  first  investment  by  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department to support the establishment of a comprehensive EVCN. \nElectrification of vehicles and decarbonization of the transport sector is widely seen as a critical \nobjective to meet the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Even if charged using a \ngrid that uses power generated from fossil fuels, electric vehicles can still reduce GHG-emissions \ncompared  to  internal  combustion  engine  vehicles.  In  addition,  fully  battery  powered  electric \nvehicles do not produce local exhaust pipe air pollutants (e.g. carbon monoxide, lead, ground-\nlevel  ozone,  particulate  matter,  sulfur  dioxide,  and  nitrogen  dioxide).  ADB\u2019s  involvement  will \nsignificantly enhance market awareness of Thailand\u2019s activities in the electric vehicle sector and \ndemonstrate  the  role  high-level  technology  can  play  in  the  urban  transport  sector  for  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries. \n \nC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \n ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C).
