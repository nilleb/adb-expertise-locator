THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach, and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL) to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for subprogram 1 of the Local Governance Reform Program. \n \n2.  In line with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u20132022, the program supports \ninclusive and sustainable growth by increasing the capacity of local governments to provide \naccountable service delivery and boost local economic development.1 The program supports \ngovernment reform priorities by (i) strengthening the local governance framework, (ii) modernizing \nand professionalizing subnational public financial management (PFM), and (iii) improving the local \ngovernment unit (LGU) financing and investment framework. Subprogram 1 is included in the \ncountry operations business plan for the Philippines, 2019\u20132021 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The programmatic approach and budget support. The Philippines is rebalancing its \ncentral\u2013local  relations  to  promote  more  accountable  service  delivery  and  local  economic \ndevelopment (para. 10). Since 2006, ADB has played a leading role in supporting government \nreform efforts through programmatic lending and technical assistance (TA). Past efforts have \nachieved important results. With ADB support, the government conducted a major review of the \n1991 Local Government Code (LGC) starting in 2013, focusing on expenditure management, and \nin 2014 introduced a medium-term LGU PFM reform strategy.3 The proposed program builds on \nthese efforts by expanding reform efforts to local governance and local economic development, \nand by aligning ADB support with government reform strategies and plans. Building on the earlier \nreview of the LGC, subprogram 1 advances a comprehensive set of amendments to the LGC \nacross  fiscal,  institutional,  and  administrative  dimensions;  professionalizes  local  PFM;  and \npromotes  local  investment  and  economic  development.  Subprogram  2  will  support \nimplementation of amendments to the LGC and expand coverage of the tools and systems \nintroduced in subprogram 1.4 The program will be complimented by a project loan, which will \nincrease local own-source revenues by supporting real property tax (RPT) reforms for targeted \nLGUs, setting up a real property valuation service, developing systems for property valuation and \ntax payments, and professionalizing local assessors.5 The government has expressed their \ncommitment to the program in the attached development policy letter (Appendix 3).6 \n \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 2 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization \nReform Program. Manila. \n4  ADB may consider a third subprogram, subject to discussions with the government. \n5  The real property tax is a local tax levied on \u201creal properties\u201d in the Philippines, including land, building and machinery. \n6  The Local Governance Reform Program was originally conceived as a sector development program incorporating \nboth a policy-based loan and a project loan; however, the sector development program has been separated into two \nindependent loans at the government\u2019s request. The separation request stems from timing differences in government \napprovals for the project versus program and does not compromise the integrity of the program as originally \nconceived. The project loan is targeted for board consideration in early 2020. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Strong economic growth has not translated into inclusive development in the Philippines, \nwhere  disparities  in  income,  access  to  services,  and  economic  opportunities  persist.  The \neconomy  grew  6.2%  per  year  on  average  from  2011  to  2017,  driven  by  robust  domestic \ninvestment and strong performance in agriculture and construction. Although external volatility \nfrom uncertain trade conditions is affecting growth prospects, gross domestic product (GDP) is \nprojected to grow 6.4% in both 2019 and 2020. However, income inequality exceeds that of \nregional peers, and national averages mask significant regional disparities.7 Poverty incidence \nfell from 26.6% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2015, but remains among the highest in Southeast Asia. \nContrary to national trends, poverty incidence is on the rise in parts of the eastern Visayas and in \nsouthern and western Mindanao; in these areas, poverty incidence can exceed 30.0%. The 22.5% \nof women in poor families have higher poverty rates than the general population; poverty \nincidence  among  women  was  highest  in  the  Bangsamoro  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim \nMindanao (BARMM), at 55.1%.8 Significant geographic diversity in the Philippines creates unique \ndevelopment challenges, where service delivery costs can be extremely high in the many remote \nparts of the country. Access to and quality of public services vary greatly across the Philippines: \nscores for grade 10 students on the National Achievement Test range from 61.4 (out of 100.0) in \nRegion XIII to 43.3 in Region I.9 Economic opportunities are also unevenly distributed. At \n\u20b1425,000 per year, the average household income in the National Capital Region (Metro Manila) \nis almost double the average for the rest of the country and almost triple the average of poorer \nareas such as Region V (Bicol Region), Region XII (comprising South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan \nKudarat, Sarangani, and General Santos in Mindanao), and BARMM.10 \n \n5.  Role  of  local  governance.  Compared  with  regional  peers,  the  Philippines  is  very \ndecentralized.  A  global  decentralization  index measuring  fiscal,  administrative,  and  political \ndecentralization places the Philippines 27th out of 182 countries, compared with Thailand (38th), \nIndonesia (40th), and Viet Nam (60th).11 Local government in the Philippines is broadly divided \ninto three levels, including provinces and independent cities, municipalities, and barangays. There \nare approximately 81 provinces, 145 cities, and some 1,490 municipalities, along with thousands \nof barangays. The LGC provides a formal basis for local management of public resources and \nservice delivery. In recognition of the disparities noted above, the government is engaged in major \nreforms to translate decentralization into inclusive growth, quality service delivery, and economic \nopportunity.  With  ADB  support,  these  efforts  have  begun  to  improve  service  delivery.  For \nexample, early childhood mortality rates declined from 31 per 1,000 in 2013 to 27 per 1,000 in \n2017,12 and the maternal mortality ratio decreased from 129 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, although \naccess to skilled birth attendants remains a challenge for the poor.13 These improvements are \npartly driven by growth in local revenue collection and spending, which increased by more than \n20% from 2011 to 2016. Likewise, overall citizen satisfaction, as measured by the government\u2019s \nCitizen Satisfaction Index, has steadily improved since 2013.14 However, more remains to be \ndone.  The  legal  framework  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  government\u2019s  evolving  vision  of \ndecentralized local governance in the Philippines, and ambitious initial efforts have not translated \n \n7  The Philippines\u2019 Gini coefficient is 0.44, compared with 0.38 in Thailand, 0.39 in Indonesia, and 0.34 in Viet Nam. \n8  Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). 2017.

News release. 30 June. \n9  The Philippines is divided into 17 regions which are not LGUs, but are administrative units used by national \ngovernment. Region I is the Ilocos Region in Luzon, and Region XIII is the Caraga Region in Mindanao. The national \naverage score for grade 10 students is 49.5 out of 100.0. \n10 2018 figures.

LGU  expenditures  comprise  about  18%  of  general \ngovernment spending. About 29% of LGU revenue comes from local own-sources, with the \nbalance coming from central transfers. Accountability and quality of service delivery are stronger \nin LGUs with a greater share of own-source revenue and weaker in LGUs where central transfers \ndominate, as such LGUs enjoy the \u201cpleasure\u201d of spending without the \u201cpain\u201d of taxation. \n \n6.  Development  constraints.  To  translate  improved  local  governance  into  positive \ndevelopment outcomes, the government must address several constraints, including: (i) the need \nfor an updated legal and regulatory framework to empower local governments to meet citizen \nneeds; (ii) capacity constraints and fragmentation of PFM tools and systems, which impede \nefficient and effective service delivery; and (iii) investment barriers that hinder equitable and \ninclusive economic development. \n \n7.  Outdated  legal  and  regulatory  framework  constrains  good  local  governance. \nSeveral  legal  and  institutional  constraints  impair  the  governance  of  LGUs  and  limit  LGUs\u2019 \naccountability  for  service  delivery.  Fiscal,  institutional,  and  administrative  arrangements  for \ndecentralized local governance in the LGC are not well-aligned with the service delivery needs \nthat LGUs face in practice. Moreover, reaching a consensus on amendments is difficult because \nof the sensitivity of decentralization reforms and the wide range of stakeholders involved. For \nexample, insufficient clarity on the legal mandate for inter-LGU cooperation limits LGUs\u2019 scope to \njointly address regional challenges\u2014for instance, by partnering for service delivery in waste \nmanagement or regional transport\u2014where economies of scale would support such an approach. \nThe complexity of the reforms and the low capacity of LGUs exacerbate these challenges. In \naddition, weaknesses in the legal framework for local revenue create a mismatch between areas \nwhere business costs are incurred and areas where taxes are collected. This discourages LGUs \nfrom mobilizing local own-source revenues and weakens the social compact between taxpayers \nand service delivery providers. \n \n8.  Fragmentation of systems and capacity constraints limit efficacy of PFM reforms. \nSignificant variation in skills and competencies exists among local PFM officials, and career \nadvancement is disconnected from capacity development. These constraints have made it difficult \nfor local governments to implement the LGU PFM reform roadmap. Weak treasury management \nhas led to low budget execution rates, consistent underspending, and unanticipated budget \nsurpluses, which doubled as a share of GDP from 2012 to 2016. Moreover, because of their \nunpredictability,  these  surpluses  have  not  been  efficiently  allocated.15  Central  government \nagencies  have  introduced  electronic  platforms  and  tools  which  have  improved  the  quality, \ntimeliness,  accountability  transparency  of  local  PFM,  such  as  the  Electronic  Statement  of \nReceipts and Expenditures and the Local Government Financial Performance Monitoring System, \nbut the tools are fragmented and have increased the administrative burden on local officials. \n \n9.  Financing constraints must be addressed if LGUs are to provide proper support for \ninfrastructure investment, disaster resilience, and local economic development. Regulatory \nand administrative barriers constrain LGU access to finance; and outside of major metropolitan \nareas, the creditworthiness of LGUs is low because of an absence of effective fiscal rules. Poor \naccess to credit financing constrains the ability of LGUs to invest in infrastructure and deliver high-\nquality services. Local investment is further stymied by poor understanding and low use of public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. High-cost and inefficient local business environments discourage investment \nand crimp local economic development. The disaster resilience of many LGUs is low, partly \nbecause of an absence of mechanisms to finance disaster risk at the local level.  \n \n15 Government of the Philippines, Bureau of Local Government Finance. 2017.

The PDP 2017\u20132022 targets efficient, effective, and \nequitable public service delivery, specifically recognizing the role of local governments. In line \nwith these objectives, the Philippines is reexamining its system of decentralized local governance. \nOne  option  being  considered  is  major  constitutional  reforms  toward  a  federal  system  of \ndecentralized local governance. While decisions on federal versus unitary systems belong to \nPhilippine citizens, all stakeholders agree that a more effective system of local governance is \nneeded. In a major shift, LGUs are moving away from acting as simple vehicles for public service \ndelivery toward catalyzing private investment and local economic development. Underpinning \nthese discussions, the ADB-supported Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization \nprogram resulted in the first systematic review and update of the LGC since it was passed in \n1991.16 In parallel with the review of the LGC, key stakeholders, including the Bureau of Local \nGovernment Finance, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of \nBudget  and  Management,  and  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  have \nintroduced reforms to improve the quality and efficiency of service delivery and to enhance private \nsector participation in local economies. \n \n11.  Programmatic  approach.  The  program  supports  three  primary  reform  areas:  \n(i) strengthening the local governance framework for service delivery; (ii) modernizing and \nprofessionalizing local PFM; and (iii) improving the LGU financing and investment framework. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government has accomplished 15 policy actions related to these reform \nareas: nine high-impact policy triggers and six policy milestones.17  \n \n12.  Strengthening  the  local  governance  framework  for  service  delivery.  Under \nsubprogram 1, a broad, consultative drafting process resulted in a suite of amendments to the \nLGC that have been filed with the Congress. Amendments included: (i) clarification on who is \nresponsible for delivering and paying for public services across government levels; and (ii) new \nmeasures to empower and promote inter-LGU cooperation; these allow LGUs to address inter-\njurisdictional issues where economies of scale invite a joint approach, such as for solid waste \nmanagement or urban transport. Major amendments to the framework for revenue mobilization \nhave also been filed with Congress, including provisions to (i) align business tax collection with \nthe geographic area in which the business activities took place, (ii) reduce uncertainty for private \ninvestment by harmonizing fees and fines across LGUs, and (iii) increase local autonomy in the \nuse  of  natural  resource  revenues.  To  promote  local revenue  mobilization,  the  government \nofficially incorporated local property tax reforms as part of the national Comprehensive Tax \nReform Program, and an updated real property valuation and assessment reform act (RPVARA) \nwas filed with the Congress as part of the government\u2019s tax reform agenda. The RPVARA aims \nto broaden the property tax base, institutionalize property valuation standards, and provide for \nprofessionalized property-value assessment consistent with international good practices. These \nreforms are expected to remove political economy barriers to regularly updating local market-\nvalue schedules, allowing LGUs to dramatically increase revenues from local property taxes. The \nproject (footnote 6) under preparation contemplates support for the implementation of the RPT \nreforms.  \n \n13.  Subprogram 2 will target implementation of key LGC amendments drafted and filed under \nsubprogram 1, such as developing and publishing implementing rules and regulations for RPT \nreforms and rolling out a unified property tax database and transaction system. Subprogram 2 will \n \n16 ADB.

The \ngovernment plans to operationalize an online e-planning system for real-time submission and \ntracking of 3-year public investment programs, and will require national government agencies to \nprioritize  projects  and  activities  in  the  Local  Development  Investment Program rather  than \nidentifying stand-alone departmental priorities.18 Finally, the government will refine functional \nroles and responsibilities of LGUs in line with the 2018 Supreme Court decision to broaden the \ndefinition  of  centrally-collected  revenues  to  be  shared  with  local  governments,  effectively \nincreasing fiscal transfers.  \n \n14.  Modernizing and professionalizing local public financial management. This reform \narea addresses public service delivery failures brought about by weak capacity in the local \nbureaucracy  and  inefficient  PFM.  One  major  accomplishment  under  subprogram  1  is  the \nStandardized Examination and Assessment for Local Treasury Service (SEAL) program. The \nSEAL program introduced a three-tier competency and assessment framework to professionalize \nlocal treasurers, representing a significant departure from the past practice of the local executive \nselecting a treasurer irrespective of professional merit. As a testament to the rigorous nature of \nthe SEAL program, the first round of examinations resulted in a pass rate of just 35% for the more \nthan 1,000 examinees, offering greater confidence that successful candidates have the skills \nnecessary for responsible stewardship of public resources. To accompany people-centered \nreform, the government has also introduced tools to defragment, simplify, and improve the cross-\nplatform functionality of local PFM. Such tools include the LGU Integrated Financial Tools (LIFT) \nPFM system, which standardizes fiscal reporting and consolidates subnational financial accounts. \nLIFT establishes cross-platform functionality between the different subnational PFM systems.  \nThe government has also formally adopted a fiscal sustainability scorecard for LGUs to grade \nboth quantitative and qualitative fiscal performance. \n \n15.  Under subprogram 2, the government will expand the professionalization of PFM officers \nin the local bureaucracy by introducing a competency measurement and assessment system for \nlocal  budget  officers,  similar  to  the  SEAL  program,  with  supporting  electronic  capacity \ndevelopment tools. Subprogram 2 will also introduce new institutional incentives for accountable \npublic finance, through the inclusion of national minimum standards for PFM performance as part \nof  the  Seal  of  Good  Local  Governance\u2019s  eligibility  criteria.  Proposed  indicators  include \ncomprehensiveness  of  budget  coverage,  strength  of  budget  execution,  timeliness  and \ntransparency  of  financial  reporting  including  gender  responsive  budgets,  and  alignment  of \nsubnational procurement with nationally recognized good practices.19 The government also plans \nto further improve linkages between subnational PFM tools and systems by linking the LGU  \ne-Budget preparatory system and the LIFT PFM system to produce a single consolidated set of \nfiscal data for the whole of local government. \n \n16.  Improving the local government unit financing and investment framework. Under \nthis reform area, the government addressed LGU financing constraints to support investment, \nservice delivery, and local economic development. Major accomplishments under subprogram 1 \ninclude passage of the Ease of Doing Business Act, 2018, which is designed to improve service \nefficiency and reduce the cost of doing business for private sector actors. In addition, a new local \nfinancing and debt framework was filed with Congress to improve LGU access to credit financing. \n \n18 The Local Development Investment Program allocates investment funds for programs, projects and activities under \nthe Comprehensive Development Plan. \n19 The Seal of Good Local Governance evaluates performance across a range of dimensions such as responsiveness \nand business friendliness and is linked to the provision of performance-based grants for qualifying LGUs. \n \n ", "6 \nThe government introduced fiscal rules to strengthen LGU creditworthiness, making LGUs more \nattractive and less risky for private lending institutions. The government also increased LGU \naccess to disaster risk financing by establishing a legal mandate for parametric localized disaster \nrisk insurance.20 Finally, the government is improving the quality and transparency of LGU \nperformance monitoring through an LGU client rating system. The system allows citizens to easily \nprovide feedback on LGU service delivery performance to management at both central and local \ngovernment levels, so systematic weaknesses can be identified and addressed. \n \n17.  Under subprogram 2, the government plans to strengthen LGU disaster risk preparedness \nby introducing a new law requiring all LGU public assets to have property insurance. Building on \nthe Ease of Doing Business Act, the government plans to consolidate the issuance of local \nlicenses and permits under an electronic single service window, further reducing transaction costs \nfor the private sector. This will encourage the launch of more business start-ups and smooth their \noperations\u2014measures that will particularly benefit women, who registered more new business \nnames (55.51%) than men in 2018.21 Finally, the government plans to enhance the online LGU \nclient rating system to cover a wider range of public services and provide real-time comparative \ninformation to citizens on the performance of their local governments. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s experience and strategy. ADB has played a leading role in supporting local \ngovernance in the Philippines through TA, programmatic lending, and investment projects (see \nthe figure below). The Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program from 2006 to \n2010  helped  institutionalize  the  timely  and  transparent  release  of  LGU  shares  in  national \ngovernment  revenues  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  service  delivery.22  It  also \noperationalized local budgeting reforms in all provinces and highly urbanized cities. From 2010 to \n2016, ADB expanded engagement with LGUs through the Local Government Finance and Fiscal \nDecentralization  Reform  Program  (footnote  16),  conducting  the  first  review  of  the  LGC  in  \n25 years (para. 12), operationalizing the Performance Challenge Fund and the Seal of Good Local \nGovernance to incentivize service delivery performance, and developing and implementing a \nmedium-term LGU PFM reform strategy.23 Project completion reports rated both ADB program \nclusters highly relevant and satisfactory overall.24 \n \nADB\u2019s Engagement on Local Governance and Public Financial Management \n2006: TA for Local  2010\u20132016: Loan for Local    2015: TA for Support to Local \nGovernance and Fiscal  Government Finance and    Government Accountability  2019\u20132021: Proposed \nManagement  FPirsocgarla Dme centralization Reform    Systems  LRoecfoarl mG o Pverornjeacnt ce \n   \n2005  2010    2015  2020 \n2006\u20132010: Loan  2011: TA for Support to Local  2 013: TA for Support to  2019\u20132021: Proposed \nand TA for Local  Government Revenue  L ocal Government Finance  Policy-based Loan for \nGovernment  GAdemneinraisttiorant iaonnd P Lroagnrda m  aR nedfo Frmisc Parlo Dgeracmen tralization  LPorocgarl aGmo vernance Reform \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB staff. \n \n20 Parametric insurance ex ante agrees to make payments upon the occurrence of a triggering event, rather than \nindemnifying pure loss.

First,  while  previous  programs  focused  on  promoting \ndecentralization to support local service delivery, the proposed program focuses on improving the \nquality and efficiency of service delivery under existing structures while equipping LGUs with the \ntools and skills to better perform their roles. Second, in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023, the program serves as an umbrella program for ADB \nengagement in local economic development in the Philippines, providing a policy anchor for \nsector-specific  operations  such  as  the  Regional  Development  Facility,  the  Livable  Cities \nInvestment Project, the Philippines City Disaster Insurance Pool, and several local infrastructure \nprojects.25 The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).26 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Program Activity \nAddressing remaining poverty  Strengthen local service delivery and foster development of local job \nand reducing inequalities  opportunities to address regional disparities \nTackling climate change,  Promote disaster preparedness through a parametric local disaster \nbuilding climate and disaster  insurance scheme; promote resilience through mandatory insurance \nresilience   of local assets \nMaking cities more livable  Improve quality and responsiveness of municipal services through \nthe local government unit client rating system; promote local \ninfrastructure investment  \nStrengthening governance and  Professionalize local public financial management officials \ninstitutional capacity \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  Lessons learned. Several lessons have emerged from ADB\u2019s engagement in local \ngovernance across the region. First, decentralization is a process for achieving the proper balance \nbetween central\u2013local relations, and a clear vision with time-bound milestones is needed to avoid \na state of perpetual decentralization. Past decentralization efforts in the Philippines have focused \non  supporting  more  decentralization  with  each  iteration,  increasing  the  relative  share  of \nresponsibilities and powers for LGUs. The evolving focus of the program is to place more \nemphasis on better local governance and service delivery for a given balance of central-local \nrelations, rather than perpetuating a cycle of ever-increasing decentralization. Second, complex \nmulti-stakeholder reforms often require more support for implementation than they require for \npolicy formulation. Earlier efforts to provide a strong framework for own-source local revenue \nmobilization have not yet solved LGUs\u2019 heavy reliance on intergovernmental fiscal transfers.27 To \npromote greater revenue autonomy, extensive support is needed for reform implementation, \nincluding tools, systems, and capacity development at multiple government levels. The design of \nthis program, as complimented by the project loan (footnote 6) will bridge this gap between policy \ndevelopment and reform implementation. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Through its long-term engagement in local governance in the \nPhilippines, ADB has supported the development of a targeted, problem-driven reform agenda in \nthe country. ADB provided TA to support revising and ultimately filing LGC amendments in \nCongress.28 ADB also supported the development of the LIFT system as well as the SEAL \n \n25 ADB. 2018.

Under the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund \ncontributed by the Government of Japan, ADB supported preparation of the RPVARA to increase \nown-source local revenues from RPTs (para. 12). This trust fund also supported the development \nof the Philippine Valuation Standards, which ensures that property assessment and valuation \npractices are in line with international practices.29 Going forward, ADB will continue to support \nlocal governance reforms through a new regional trust fund.30 \n \n22.  Development partner coordination. ADB is the leading partner on local governance in \nthe Philippines but works closely with other development partners to ensure that efforts are \naligned and complementary. ADB meets regularly with the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment on local infrastructure development and regional assistance to Mindanao. It has \nalso coordinated closely with the International Monetary Fund, and policy actions under the \nprogram  are  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  broad  assessment  and \nrecommendations for the Philippines. ADB also coordinates with the World Bank, particularly on \nensuring links between national PFM reforms (World Bank) and subnational PFM reforms (ADB). \nThe Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has also provided technical assistance, including a \nstudy on the French approach to inter-LGU service delivery coordination. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  In line with the Philippines Development Plan (PDP) 2017\u20132022, the program has the \nfollowing impact: efficient, effective, and equitable public service delivery enhanced (footnote 1). \nThe program will have the following outcome: service delivery ability and local governance \nperformance  of  LGUs  improved.  The  impact  of  the  program  is  demonstrated  through  the \nperformance indicators in the design and monitoring framework.31 \n \n24.  The economic impact of the local governance reforms under the program is expected to \nbe substantial. The program impact assessment estimates the program\u2019s potential net economic \nbenefits at $1.5 billion\u2013$1.7 billion, using conservative assumptions.32 The primary transmission \nchannels for benefits are improved quality and efficiency of public service delivery in line with local \npreferences, reduced reliance on other distortionary tax and nontax revenue sources, and lower \ncost of doing business for the private sector.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n25.  The government has requested two regular loans of $300 million each for subprograms 1 \nand 2, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The PBL will provide \nbudget financing to support improved service delivery and local governance performance as well \nas priority activities in the government\u2019s development policy letter.33 The loan for subprogram 1 \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \n \n29 ADB. 2011.

Based  on  the  annuity  repayment  method,  the  average  maturity  is  \n12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.34 The loan for subprogram 2 is in \nthe pipeline for 2021.  \n \n26.  The Philippines\u2019 total financing needs for 2018\u20132021 are expected to be substantial, with \nannual budget deficits projected to increase from 3.0% of GDP in 2018 to 3.2% of GDP in 2019. \nIn 2019, the government\u2019s gross financing need is $20.1 billion. To finance the deficit, the \ngovernment plans to raise $17.4 billion from the issuance of securities and $2.7 billion from official \nforeign loans. The loan size for subprogram 1 reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, the \nstrength of the program, and the net economic benefits (para. 24). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency for the program. The Bureau \nof Local Government Finance, Department of Budget and Management, the Department of \nInterior and Local Government, National Economic and Development Authority, and Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Center are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is June  \n2017\u2013June 2019. A steering committee chaired by the DOF oversees program implementation. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).    \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n28.  Safeguards. The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n29.  Poverty and social. Reforms under the program will help the government achieve its \npoverty reduction targets by expanding the quality and range of public services available to the \npoor and by providing opportunities for inclusive local economic development. Specific measures \nwill include the introduction of (i) an LGU client rating system to provide the poor with a feedback \nchannel to improve service delivery, and (ii) local parametric disaster insurance to help ensure a \ntimely fiscal response to the needs of the poor in a post-disaster situation. Subprogram 1 is \nclassified some gender elements. Linking the comprehensive development planning process \n(through which LGUs determine development priorities) with the Local Development Investment \nProgram  (through  which  LGUs  identify  investment  projects)  will  provide  a  platform  for \nmainstreaming  gender  dimensions.  Reforming  the  local  business  environment  will  have  a \nparticularly important impact on women small business owners and entrepreneurs. The LIFT \nsystem will provide a mechanism for gender-responsive budgeting and tracking of expenditures \nin line with government regulations.  \n \n30.  Governance. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted in \n2017 by the World Bank found that three of seven core PFM areas have improved: policy-based \nbudgeting, transparency, and asset\u2013liability management. Financial management is weaker, but \nefforts to improve budget credibility, predictability, execution, and external scrutiny and audit are \nongoing. Reforms under the program will significantly strengthen local PFM. The government is \nalso implementing a results-based anticorruption plan that will strengthen the judicial branch of \ngovernment and the Office of the Ombudsman. ADB explained its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) to the government including the DOF. The overall governance risk for the \n \n34 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n ", "10 \nprogram is low to moderate.
