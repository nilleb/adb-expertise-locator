The  formal  forestry  sector  contributes  about  5%  to  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and accounts for 34% of total export value, and \neven more of net foreign exchange earnings. But these trends have been \naccompanied by decline in forest cover from 70% in 1970 to approximately \n42% in 2000, resulting in vast areas of degraded forestland that can be \nbrought  under  productive  forest  plantations.  Lao  PDR,  along  the  Lao \nMekong Plains, has significant potential and comparative advantage over \nits  neighbors  to  develop  financially  viable  forest  plantations  subsector \nbecause  of:  (i)  suitable  climate  and  site  conditions  for  growing  trees; \n(ii) low population density; (iii) vast areas of degraded forestland; (iv) flat or \nundulating  terrain;  (v)  an  existing  road  infrastructure  that  is  being \nupgraded; (vi) access to large markets in neighboring countries; (vii) low \ncosts for land lease; and (viii) competitive costs for labor and inputs. The \nProject will establish a new institution, the Lao Plantation Authority (LPA), \nwhich  will  spearhead  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the \nplantations subsector in Lao PDR, combined with livelihood improvement \nand poverty reduction. It will provide full-package service to livelihood and \nenterprise plantations and one-window service to facilitate operations of \nmultinational companies to develop industrial plantations. LPA will be a \nfinancially viable and self-sustaining institution. \n   \nRationale  The Industrial Tree Plantation Project (ITPP) was rated \u201cunsuccessful\u201d in \nthe recent project completion report, as it could not meet its designed \noutcome. Reasons include: (i) inappropriate site selection, (ii) poor quality \nplanting stock, (iii) inadequate skills among Department of Forestry (DOF) \nstaff, (iv) subsidized credit prone to abuse, (v) inadequate and ill-timed \nexpert inputs, and (vi) insufficient supervision by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB).  However,  ITPP  has  established  that:  (i)  efficient  forest \nplantations of all sizes are financially viable, and (ii) existing Government \ninstitutions have inadequate capacity to provide effective support to this \nimportant  and  emerging  subsector.  During  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of ITPP, it was assumed that the capacity of DOF could be \nstrengthened to provide the necessary support to forest plantations. The \nexperience of ITPP has demonstrated that supporting forest plantations is \na  highly  specialized  task  that  requires  a  different  set  of  skills  and \noperational modalities than required for natural forest management, which ", "ii \nis the mainstay of DOF\u2019s experience and expertise. Plantations form a \nniche  subsector;  individual  staff  and  institutions  require  specific  and \nproven capacity from raising nurseries to marketing plantation products. \nSimilarly, the financing of forest plantations requires a specific lending \nproduct\u2014equity  financing  or  full-term  credit\u2014for  which  assessment, \ndelivery, and collection have to be synchronized with the establishment, \nproduction, and felling cycles of plantations. Taking medium-term loans is \nimpractical as there is no interim income to service interest payments \nduring the 8-year rotation. Furthermore, the Agricultural Promotion Bank, \nestablished in 1994, was in no position then or now to cope with the \ndemands and requirements of this subsector. \n \nAn ineffective land-use planning and tenure system continue to constrain \nthe development of livelihood and large-scale industrial plantations. The \ncurrent 3-year term for a temporary land-use certificate, which can be \nrolled over, requires formal confirmation and registration. This process is \nconstrained by inadequate capacity of existing Government institutions, \nalthough it is provided for by the Land Law. It is essential that issuance of \nland-use certificates is synchronized with the plantation rotation cycle. LPA \nwill set up a land registry and facilitate the issuance of land-use certificates \nto  livelihood  planters  after  they  have  established  their  credentials  as \nserious operators at the end of the first 8-year rotation. \n \nThe relevant rules and regulations need refinement and clarification. Land-\nlease  agreement  negotiations  with  the  Government,  for  industrial \nplantations,  are  time-consuming  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI) \nprocedures  in  this  subsector  are  not  always  transparent.  Plantation \nmanagement guidelines\u2014appropriate to the scale/type of plantations\u2014\nshould be developed and made operational. In particular, harvesting and \ntransit rules need to be rationalized to avoid marketing and delivery delays \nand  minimize  rent-seeking  opportunities.  Similarly,  plantation  logs  and \nwoodchips should be exempted from export duties and restrictions so that \nthe foreign exchange earning potential of the subsector is fully realized.  \n \nCurrent institutional and staff capacity constraints are preventing Lao PDR \nfrom (i) developing a vibrant plantations subsector, and (ii) capturing the \neconomic  development  potential  of  its  land  and  water  resources.  The \nForest Plantations Development Project (the Project), by establishing LPA, \nwill  address  these  institutional,  human  resource,  and  technological \nconstraints. LPA will provide the necessary support to all types of clients \nefficiently, and will facilitate the enforcement of environmental and social \nsafeguards.  \n   \nImpact and  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  contribute  to  steady  economic  growth, \nOutcome  accelerated poverty reduction, and improved environmental conservation. \nAs  a  direct  outcome  of  the  Project,  an  efficient  and  equitable  forest \nplantations subsector would take off. The Project will reduce poverty of \nparticipating  households,  create  a  substantial  plantation  resource,  and \ncatalyze large-scale international private investment in plantations that will \nlead  to  the  development  of  a  modern  wood  processing  industry.  The \nProject will achieve its objectives by: (i) establishing a semiautonomous, ", "iii \nsustainable, and efficient new institution to support the development of this \nsubsector; and (ii) supporting financially viable livelihood and enterprise \nplantations, and facilitating the establishment of industrial plantations and \nthe associated processing industry. The Project will reduce poverty by: \n(i) generating  income  and  employment  opportunities  for  unskilled  and \nsemiskilled  rural  poor;  (ii)  creating  assets  for  poor  households;  and \n(iii) raising substantial revenues and foreign exchange for the Government \nto improve the country\u2019s fiscal and balance of payments situation. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties is estimated at \n$15.35  million  equivalent,  consisting  of  foreign  exchange  costs  of \n$6.45 million (42%) and local currency costs of $8.90 million (58%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n \nADB Loan  4.10  2.90  7.00    45.5 \nADF Grant  1.70  1.30  3.00    19.5 \nGovernment of  0.65  0.00  0.65    4.0 \nMalaysia \nGovernment   0.00  2.12  2.12    14.0 \nLocal Banks  0.00  0.29  0.29    2.0 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  2.29  2.29    15.0 \n  Total  6.45  8.90  15.35    100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nNote: Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan and Grant  A loan in various currencies in special drawing rights (SDR), equivalent to \nAmounts and  $7 million, will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan \nTerms  will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nA grant in the amount equivalent to $3,000,000 will be provided from the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF). \n   \nPeriod of  30 June 2012 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) \nAgency \n   \nImplementation  MAF will be the executing agency pending formal establishment of LPA \nArrangements  following  approval  of  LPA  decree.  Once  operational,  LPA  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency.  LPA  will  have  a  board  of  directors  (BOD),  a  high-", "iv \nranking Government official as its managing director, and a professional \nchief  technical  advisor  (CTA).  Its  operations  will  be  divided  into  four \ndivisions, nine units, and a public relations office. Each division will be \nheaded  by  a  director.  The  Livelihood  and  Industrial  Plantations  are \nexecuting  divisions,  while  the  Land  Survey  and  Finance  and  Human \nResources are support divisions. As a semiautonomous agency, the BOD \nwill be empowered by the Government, through a prime ministerial decree, \nto implement LPA\u2019s mandate. BOD will approve: (i) appointment of LPA \nstaff; (ii) LPA\u2019s quarterly, annual, and long-term work plans; (iii) land-lease \nagreements for enterprise and industrial plantations; and (iv) business \nproposals for setting up processing industries. The BOD will be chaired by \nthe Vice Minister of MAF. Other relevant line agencies will be represented \nby deputy director generals or an official of higher rank. LPA will be run \nlike a corporate body, and annual financial and technical audits will be \ncarried out by external auditors. It will issue an annual report. \n   \nProcurement  Goods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, \nequipment, civil works, and materials will be procured by international \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from \n$100,000 to $500,000 equivalent. Where several local suppliers can offer \nsatisfactory service facilities, then vehicles, equipment, civil works, and \nmaterials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured under \nlocal competitive bidding procedures, or through direct purchase. Final \ndetails for procurement will be determined during project implementation \nas appropriate. To commence the Project on time, ADB has approved, at \nthe  Government\u2019s  request,  advance  action  for  procurement.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of such advance action does \nnot commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n   \nStaffing   At full strength by year-3, LPA will have a total of 40 management and \nprofessional staff. During the first 12\u201318 months after its inception, LPA \nwill be staffed in stages according to its work plan. An interim-CTA (iCTA) \nwill be recruited for about 6 months, and will be responsible for searching \nand short listing candidates for the tenured CTA position. All staff positions \nwill be filled with qualified individuals, as defined against each position, \nfollowing  a  transparent  process.  The  iCTA/CTA  will  be  empowered  to \nsearch,  shortlist,  interview,  and  select  staff.  BOD  will  approve  the \nrecruitment of selected candidate(s) after LPA receives concurrence from \nADB and the Government of Malaysia. Four internationally recruited staff \nwill be engaged (252 person-months). The iCTA/CTA will be offered a \ncompetitive  package,  comparable  to  those  provided  by  similar  private \nsector  multinationals  and  development  agencies.  Three  experts,  to \nsupervise 3 divisional directors, will be seconded by the Government of \nMalaysia. Some 35 nationally recruited professional staff (2,520 person-\nmonths)  and  24  support  staff  (1,728  person-months)  will  be  offered \nemployment packages comparable with those provided by multinational \ncompanies operating in Lao PDR, in order to attract and retain highly \nskilled staff. \n ", "v \n \nSuitably qualified Lao nationals will be engaged as directors of divisions \nand will work under the supervision of respective international experts and \nthe CTA. A staff transition plan will be prepared at the outset to include \nnecessary on-the-job and short-term training of Lao staff to take on the \nresponsibilities without the supervision of international experts starting in \nyears 4\u20135 of project implementation. However, it is anticipated that an \ninternational CTA may be required even beyond project completion. \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project\u2019s core interventions in livelihood, enterprise, and industrial \nand Beneficiaries  plantations  will  have  significant  impact  on  the  income  of  participating \nplanters  and  entrepreneurs.  Small  livelihood  plantations  (SLPs), \nestablished on 9,500 hectares (ha), will be financially viable, create full-\ntime  employment  for  the  2,000  participating households,  and  increase \ntheir cash income within the first year from $150 to $385 per ha per \nannum. This increase will pull average household\u2019s total annual income \nabove the food poverty line of $738 (footnote 19). A typical household with \n5 ha allocation will be pulled above the food poverty line with a constant \nstream of income from labor inputs on their own plantations for the next \n5 years. LPA will compensate them for their labor inputs as part of its \nequity  in  SLPs.  From  years  8\u201312,  household  will  receive  on  average \n$858/ha/year income as its share of the revenues. These revenues will \nmore than double their total annual household income and increase their \ncash income by six times. In the process, livelihood plantations will create \na resourceful asset for poor households, for which they will receive land-\nuse certificate at the end of first 8-year rotation. This increase in income \nand asset creation will have significant impact on poverty reduction and \nthe general well-being of the average household. With this level of cash \nincome,  the  household  will  be  able  to  afford  basic  education,  primary \nhealthcare,  and  more  nutritious  food.  The  multiplier  effect\u2014with  more \nopportunities for trade and employment\u2014could dramatically change the \nsocioeconomic profiles of participating villages within 8\u201310 years. \n \nEven if only half the expressions of interest from multinational companies \nmaterialize, the pace of development in the plantations subsector would \nbe significant. Conservative estimates show that as much as 150,000 ha \nmay be under industrial plantations by 2015. This scale of development \nwould create massive employment opportunities. Even 10,000 ha/year of \nplantation development will create 1 million person-days employment. This \nwould result in labor shortages, requiring increasingly mechanized means \nof  plantation  management.  This  transformation  would  lead  to  higher \nwages, jobs with better skills, and a significant multiplier effect on regional \nand national economies. \n   \nRisks and  Establishment  of  LPA  and  large-scale  development  of  the  forest \nAssumptions  plantations subsector would entail political, institutional, market, business, \nfinancial, and environmental risks. The establishment of LPA is a unique \ndevelopment  in  Lao  PDR  and  is  a  high-risk  high-return  investment. \nHowever,  all  these  risks\u2014individually  as  well  as  collectively\u2014can  be \nmanaged  and  mitigated.  LPA  would  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all \nexcept the political risk. There are two types of political risks: one would be ", "vi \nfaced by LPA itself and the other by Lao PDR. To mitigate the political risk \nfaced  by  Lao  PDR,  ADB  could  provide  a  political  risk  guarantee  to \nqualified foreign investors. But mitigation of political risk for the LPA would \ndepend on the Government\u2019s commitment to allow LPA to practice its \nautonomy without interference. By approving a prime ministerial decree for \nestablishing LPA, the Government will demonstrate its commitment to LPA \nas  a  semiautonomous  body.  The  Government  has  provided  specific \nassurances,  and  key  triggers  have  been  covenanted  in  the  Loan \nAgreement, to stall and/or withdraw support in case LPA does not operate \nin  accordance  with  its  agreed  design.  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nMalaysia  will  provide  close  supervision  by  deploying  skilled  and \nexperienced international experts in LPA\u2019s formative years. ADB will also \nprovide active and rigorous project supervision to ensure that political risk \nis effectively mitigated. \n   \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the \nForest Plantations Development Project (the Project). The project processing chronology is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Forest Sector and the National Economy \n2.  The total land area of Lao PDR is 236,800 square kilometers (km2) and the present \nforest cover is approximately 42%. About 25,000 km2 (2.5 million hectares [ha]) are designated \nproduction  forests  and  another  35,000  km2  have  potential  for  commercial  production.  The \nremaining 80,000 km2 are classed forest fallow and scrub. Although the predominant economic \nsector of Lao PDR is agriculture\u2014involving 85% of the country\u2019s 5.6 million people\u2014in some \nrural areas, forest resource exploitation can be one of the few available economic activities. For \nmany rural poor, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) may provide more than half the household \nincome. The water sector is also of vital importance to the economy for irrigation, hydropower, \nand fish resources. Water, in turn, is heavily dependent on forests for protecting catchments \nfrom soil erosion and maintaining seasonal water flow. \n \n3.  The formal forestry sector contributes about 5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) \nand accounts for 34% of total export value, and even more of net foreign exchange earnings. \nSawn wood was the most valuable export product, but the wood industry was predominately \nbased on logs from natural forests and industrial capacity exceeded long-term sustainable \nannual allowable cut. As a result, the Government introduced a ban on the export of logs in \n2000 and the harvest of natural wood decreased from 730,000 cubic meters (m3) in 1999 to \n200,000 m3 in 2001. Government revenues from log royalties have decreased from 20% in the \nmid-1990s to 6% of tax revenues and 5% of all revenues in 2000. No data is available on \nspecific financial values deriving from forest plantations, but the contribution is still small. A \nnumber of foreign-funded projects have provided technical assistance (TA) and investment \nfinancing to the forestry sector since the late 1970s (Appendix 2). \n \n2.  Sector Strategies \n4.  The  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy  for  2020  forecasts  GDP \ngrowth of 7% per annum. By 2010, the Government aims to reduce poverty by half from its \ncurrent level of 39%. Furthermore, there is a national commitment to attain 70% forest cover by \n2020\u2014accomplished through forest rehabilitation and planting. Therefore, in formulating the \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES)2, the Government attached great \n                                                 \n1  The Project is included in ADB. 2004.

The Government is aware of the significant \npotential forests can make to national economic growth, poverty reduction, environmental and \nbiodiversity protection, and sequestration of carbon to mitigate its impact on global climate.  \n \n5.  NGPES aspires to meet its objectives through natural resource development. Future \ngrowth-enhancing investments and development priorities, which reflect the economic potential \nof the country\u2019s natural resource base, have been identified as means to increase national \nrevenues and eradicate poverty. Hydropower, mining, tourism, and wood- and agro-processing \nindustries are the highest priorities for such investments. Royalties and taxes to the Government \nwill comprise the bulk of the revenues generated by these investments. Emphasis will be placed \non  promoting  economic  growth  centers  throughout  the  country  to  further  develop  the  rich \nendowment of natural resources including land, water, forest, and biodiversity. This includes the \nidentification and delineation of regions to better integrate economic, infrastructure, trade, and \nservices development. Macroeconomic stability, private sector development, trade facilitation, \nand regional integration policies and strategies all feed into expanding this resource base to \npromote economic growth nationwide. \n \n6.  Recently,  the  Government  adopted  the  comprehensive  Forest  Strategy  2020.3  This \nstrategy consolidates the Government\u2019s vision and related policies to develop the forestry sector \nand plantations subsector on a sustainable basis. To implement NGPES and Forest Strategy \n2020, the Government wishes to promote both private and public sector investments in forest \nplantations development. The objective is to develop the plantations subsector on a large scale \nto  create  substantial  supply  of  industrial  raw  material  and  generate  employment.  This  will \neventually lead to the expansion of the country\u2019s wood-processing industry and enable Lao PDR \nto become a major supplier of wood products to international markets, which are experiencing \nan increasing deficit of wood and fiber supplies. To mobilize the necessary financial resources, \nthe  Government  aims  to  promote  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  in  the  forest  plantations \nsubsector.  The  Government  also  encourages  the  participation  of  poor  households  in \nestablishing forest plantations for livelihoods by allocating suitable lands in rural areas. \n \n3.  Sector Policies and Regulations \n7.  There  are  about  26  pieces  of  legislation\u2014foreign  investment,  business,  tax, \nenvironmental, land, water, and forest laws, decrees, regulations, and orders\u2014that govern \ndifferent  aspects  of  forest  plantations  and  associated  industrial  processing  in  Lao  PDR. \nTherefore, establishing forest plantations in the country entails compliance with a complex \nregulatory framework. The plantation development process, from land allocation to harvesting \nand marketing of logs, is covered by multiple regulations enforced by different Government \nagencies and departments. About 12 licenses, permits, and approvals are required at various \nstages. Many of these are linked to the size of the land area, as larger plantation areas require \nhigher-level approval. The regulations derive from various laws, subsidiary decrees, and orders \nfrom several different ministries. Some of the approvals or licenses must be obtained before \napplication can be made for others, so it is not possible to secure all of them at one time from \none place. Nonetheless, Lao PDR has an adequate set of policies and regulations to govern \ndevelopment of the forest plantations subsector. A comprehensive review of the relevant laws, \ndecrees, regulations, and orders, as well as a proposed policy and regulatory framework, are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n                                                 \n3  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2005. Forest Strategy 2020. Vientiane. ", "    3 \n8.  ADB's  Policy  on  Forestry  (1995)  identifies  plantations  as  a  sustainable  and \nenvironmentally  sound  source  of  industrial  raw  material  and  means  for  enhancing  rural \nemployment opportunities and household incomes. It recommends the establishment of fast-\ngrowing, high-yielding tree plantations in selected degraded forests and grasslands with the \ninvolvement of the private sector (corporations, communities, and individual households). It \nrecommends  a  participatory  process  involving  primary  project  beneficiaries  and  relevant \nstakeholders in establishing land tenure status, site and species selection, and decisions on \nplantation silviculture and management regimes. The Lao PDR Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate, 2005\u20132006 identifies the forest plantations subsector as having significant potential to \ndiversify traditional subsistence agriculture in the country. \n \n4.  Forest Plantations Development \n9.  Planting of fast-growing exotic tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus and Acacia) for industrial \npurposes started in Lao PDR about 10 years ago. The ADB-supported Industrial Tree Plantation \nProject (ITPP)4 pioneered this development and established about 9,000 ha in Vientiane Capital \nand  Vientiane,  Bolikhamxay,  Khammuane,  Savannakhet,  Saravane,  and  Champasack \nprovinces.5 Since 1999, additional plantations have been established through the Government's \nreplanting schemes. The current total area of forest plantations in Lao PDR has been estimated \nat 95,000 ha.6 But most of these consist of teak plantations in the northern provinces. Forest \nStrategy 2020 has an ambitious goal of establishing plantations on 500,000 ha by 2020. The \ntarget  for  each  of  the  seven  ITPP  provinces  is  around  50,000  ha  in  the  same  period. \nDevelopment of livelihood plantations is an effective way to reduce poverty because it helps the \nGovernment implement NGPES and Forest Sector Strategy 2020, generate employment, create \nassets, and provide additional and alternative sources of income for poor households. \n \n5.  Wood Processing Industry \n10.  Compared with other countries, the wood processing industry is small, with annual sawn \nwood and plywood production of approximately 250,000 m3, mainly using logs from natural \nforest. Forest plantations also produce sawlogs (20\u201345 cm diameter) and pulplogs (10\u201320 cm \ndiameter). The latter are the predominant output at present, as the plantations are still young. \nAlthough  processing  of  plantation  logs  commenced  less  than  5  years  ago,  there  are  two \nvertically integrated factories in the Vientiane area focusing on plantation grown logs. The \ncombined capacity is approximately 3,000 m3 per annum. But insufficient kiln drying capacity \nand raw material supply is causing underutilization of capacity. Despite such problems, these \nfactories have secured contracts with international companies that distribute a wide range of \nvalue-added wood products throughout the world. However, the subsector is not competitive \ninternationally because: (i) insufficient capacity does not make it a credible supplier, (ii) it lacks \ncritical manufacturing mass, and (iii) transport costs are high. Because of these constraints, \nwhich  all  relate  to  lack  of  economies  of  scale,  production  of  sawn  timber  products  from \nEucalyptus camaldulensis is barely profitable. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

Although this report shows the total plantation area to be 13,800 ha, subsequent random field surveys \nby ADB, using GPS measuring devices have discovered a trend of overreporting the area by planters, often by \nabout 35\u201340%. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the actual total planting area under ITPP may be about \n9,000 ha.  \n6  Data from National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service/Plantation and Reforestation Extension Centre. ", "4 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Weak Institutional Capacity \n11.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is the main national level institution \nresponsible for all aspects of forestry administration, including inspection. During 2001\u20132002, \nMAF was reorganized by establishing three new institutions: (i) Technical and Science Council \nof Agriculture and Forestry, (ii) National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), \nand  (iii) National  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension  Service  (NAFES).  The  reorganization \ntransferred all agriculture and forestry research activities to NAFRI, and all agriculture and \nforestry extension activities (including ITPP and extension projects) to NAFES. However, the \nDepartment of Forestry (DOF) maintains responsibility for administering and regulating the \nforest plantations subsector. MAF is now composed of 12 departments/units, of which seven \nhave  cross-cutting  responsibilities  for  different  aspects  of  forestry  administration.  DOF  is \nresponsible for forests, plantations, and wood industry administrative matters and activities, \nincluding inspection. DOF is organized in three divisions and two sections. NAFES has three \nsections  (extension  and  project  management,  administration  and  planning,  and  rural \ndevelopment) and two subsector training centers (livestock, and agriculture and forestry). In \nmid-2005,  NAFES  reorganized  its  Provincial/District  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Extension \nServices (PAFES/DAFES); the primary interface between MAF, villages, and farmers. PAFES \nhas technical staff in charge of sector work for livestock, agriculture, forestry, and irrigation.  \n \n12.  At the provincial level, there are Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Offices (PAFOs).7 At \nthe field level, forestry administration is carried out by the village committees in charge of tax \ncollection. PAFOs are divided into seven sections, of which the Provincial Forestry Office and \nPAFES are primarily concerned with forestry matters. \n \n13.  The overall capacity of all agricultural institutions is weak. Those that deal with the \nforestry sector are no exception. The modest capacity that exists in the forestry institutions \nmainly deals with the management of natural forests. The forest plantations require different \nsets of training and skills ranging from land-use planning to site selection, raising modern \nnursery stock, extension, and marketing. Forestry institutions, at all levels in the Government, \nare neither geared nor motivated to undertake such a complex set of tasks. Under ITPP, TA \nwas provided to create such capacity but it could not create the requisite critical mass of \nexpertise. Most of the current NAFES and DOF staff do not have the skills for such tasks. The \nappropriately  educated  and  motivated  individuals  do  not  work  for  Government  institutions \nbecause of lack of incentives and commensurate compensation. In other countries, where \nplantations subsectors have done well, autonomous and specialized institutions were set up to \nhandle the tasks\u2014Fiji Pine Company of Fiji; Sabah Softwoods Inc. in Sabah, Malaysia; and \nFederal Land Development Authority (FELDA) of Malaysia. On the other hand, institutions that \nwere created within the department or at arm\u2019s-length of the department (Perhutani of Indonesia \nand Forest Industry Organization of Thailand) are not as successful and/or efficient. \n \n2.  Inadequate Human Resources  \n14.  The  Master  Plan  Study  on  Integrated  Rural Development  in  Lao PDR  provides  an \nindication of extension staff numbers by gender and level of education.8 At PAFES level, only \n                                                 \n7  District Agriculture and Forestry Offices (DAFOs) have been changed to DAFES. \n8  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2003. Master Plan Study on Integrated Rural Development \nin Lao PDR. Vientiane. ", "    5 \n10% of staff have bachelor or higher level education; a further 26% have technical training. At \nDAFES level, there is a much lower level of formal education: only 3% of staff have bachelor or \nhigher educational and 9% have technical education. This analysis shows that there is not only \nan absolute scarcity of well-trained staff but the level of skill of those already in service is not \ncommensurate with job requirements. The proportion of women staff is generally low. While \nthere are relatively more women at PAFES, there is still a need for increased number of female \nstaff who are better able to understand and assist women farmers. The proportion of staff who \ncan speak an ethnic minority language is low. A more detailed institutional analysis is provided \nin Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned and Related Constraints \n15.  The recent ITPP project completion report (PCR)9 rated it \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d ITPP could not \nmeet its designed outcome due to the following reasons: (i) poor site selection, (ii) bad quality \nplanting stock, (iii) inadequate skills among DOF staff, (iv) subsidized credit prone to abuse, \n(v) inadequate and ill-timed expert inputs, and (vi) insufficient supervision by ADB. During the \npreparation and implementation of ITPP, it was assumed that the capacity of DOF could be \nstrengthened to provide the necessary support to forest plantations. The outcome of ITPP has \ndemonstrated that supporting forest plantations is a highly specialized task that requires an \nentirely different set of skills. Forest plantation development is a niche subsector; individual staff \nand  institutions  need  to  have  specific  and  proven  capacity  for  land-use  planning,  nursery \nraising, planters\u2019 training, financial management, and marketing. Under ITPP, DOF selected \nmany sites that were spread out too thinly over a large area. Therefore, most of the plantations \nwere not established in blocks. Several sites had inappropriate soil conditions; many were acidic \nand/or had hard pans. Despite the guidelines provided under ITPP, DOF was not able to \nundertake  appropriate  land-use  planning,  resulting  in  fragmented  plantations  established \nwithout soil testing and proper land preparation. Geographical spread of livelihood plantations \nsubstantially increased the cost of extension and marketing. \n \n16.  The subsidized credit line, extended through the Agricultural Promotion Bank (APB), was \nabused by many borrowers by either not planting the full area declared or not planting at all. The \namount of credit per hectare was also set 25\u201335% higher than the actual cost of plantation \nestablishment in most cases. In addition, APB had inadequate technical capacity to deal with \nsuch a Project and effectively manage the line of credit. The plantation financing required a \nspecific lending product (i.e., a full-term loan), for which assessment, delivery, and collection \nhave to be synchronized with the establishment, production, and felling cycles of plantations. \nMoreover, the interest payments, required from the outset, were also a burden since no cash \nincome is generated from plantations in the interim years. APB was established in 1994 and \nwas in no position, then or now, to cope with the demands and requirements of this subsector. \n \n17.  The expert inputs for ITPP were inadequate to begin with and were also ill-timed. Most \nof the technical inputs were already exhausted even before sizeable planting started in year-3 \n(1997) of the Project. ADB changed its project officers frequently and missions were not fielded \nregularly  at  appropriate  stages  of  the  Project.  The  PCR  rated  ADB\u2019s  performance  as \n\u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d \n \n18.   Land tenure for plantations, for both small livelihood and large industrial plantations, \nrequires refinements. The Government now has a policy by which the 3-year term of temporary \nland-use certificates (TLUCs) can be extended. However, it is important that land tenure allows \nlivelihood planters transfer of user rights in the interim and grants land ownership after they \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Project Completion Report for Loan 1295\u2013LAO. Manila. ", "6 \nhave established credentials as serious planters at the end of one full rotation. Approval of land \nlease agreements (LLAs) for over 10,000 ha rests with the National Assembly. Consideration \nneeds to be given to increasing this threshold to promote more efficient FDI in this subsector. \nLLA negotiations with the Government are time-consuming and the procedures for FDI in this \nsubsector are not always transparent. Plantation management guidelines\u2014appropriate to the \nscale and type of plantations\u2014also need to be developed. \n \n19.  An important precursor to resolving the issues of land tenure and LLA is land-use \nplanning and zoning according to land capabilities. Geographic information systems (GISs), \ngeo-positional satellite (GPS) devices, and satellite imagery provide powerful yet efficient and \ncost-effective tools to aide in land-use planning and zoning. The Forest Inventory and Planning \nDivision, within DOF, has limited capacity to deal with these tasks. A GIS database of suitable \nlands for plantations must be developed, taking into account: (i) technical, environmental, and \nsocial criteria; (ii) land use for protection and production forests and agriculture; (iii) population \ndensity and levels of poverty; (iv) existing transport infrastructure and wood processing industry; \nand (v) access to markets, etc. \n \n20.  In  summary,  ITPP  demonstrated  that:  (i)  due  to  inappropriate  site  selection  and \ninadequate farmer training and support services, average productivity of ITPP plantations is less \nthan half the potential mean annual increment (MAI) of 20 m3/ha/year; (ii) productive plantations \nare financially viable thus do not require subsidized credit; (iii) there is a need to provide full-\nterm  credit  (or  other  form  of  financing)  that  matures  at  the  end  of  plantation  rotation; \n(iv) extending the line of credit through APB is inefficient due to its weak capacity and lack of \nmotivation;  (v)  output  markets  do  not  yet  function  efficiently  and  planters  are  duped  by \nintermediaries into selling logs at throwaway prices because of lack of knowledge and limited \nchoice;  and  (vi)  land  tenure  issues  require  further  refinements.  However,  the  two  main \nconclusions are that: (i) well established and well managed plantations can be financially viable, \nand (ii) existing Government institutions have inadequate capacity to provide effective support to \nthis  subsector.  Therefore,  the  experience  of  ITPP  shows  that  the  future  success  of  small \nlivelihood  plantations  (SLPs)  will  depend  on  coordinated  technical,  financial,  and  market \nsupport. In short, institutions must provide an efficient, full-package service to its clients. \n \n21.  Similarly, the growing and tangible interest of multinational companies in this subsector, \nto establish large industrial plantations (LIPs), should be facilitated by a well equipped and \ntechnically  skilled  institution.  This  process  in turn  depends  on  coordinated  support  from  a \nnumber of relevant Government agencies to issue all the necessary permits, licenses, and \napprovals. Such a coordinated service can be effectively provided through an institution that \nprovides one-window service to interested private sector investors. \n \n22.  The  efficient  development  of  a  financially  viable  plantation  subsector\u2014which  will \nsignificantly contribute to poverty reduction, economic growth, and government revenues\u2014\nwould mainly depend on resolving land availability and land allocation issues efficiently. As \nshown by ITPP, existing institutions and capacity will not be able to support plantations any \nbetter than in the past. Hence, there is a need to develop suitable alternative institutional \narrangements as part of the Project. \n \n4.  Opportunities \n23.  Estimates of growth potential for Eucalyptus spp. under ITPP indicate that the MAI for an \n8-year rotation is 6\u201324 m3/ha/year, depending on site conditions and management practices. At \ncurrent prices and costs, a yield of at least 16 m3/ha/year is required for the plantation to be ", "    7 \nfinancially  viable.  Therefore,  close  attention  has  to  be  paid  to  site  selection  and  efficient \nmanagement. MAI registered in other Eucalyptus camaldulensis trial plots, under ITPP, was \n7-27 m3/ha/year. Recent data from NAFRI\u2019s 10-year old stands in the research area in Nam \nXouang (Vientiane Capital) has shown MAI of 35 m3/ha/year for Acacia auriculiformis and 30 \nm3/ha/year for the best Eucalyptus urophylla. \n \n24.  Continued steady economic growth in Lao PDR will increase demand for an expanding \nrange of forest products. Similarly, economic growth in Thailand and Viet Nam, which has \nresumed following the financial crisis of 1997\u201398, combined with rapid economic growth in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India, is creating substantial growth in demand for wood and \nwood  products,  including  woodchips,  pulp,  paper,  and  furniture.  Lao  PDR,  along  the  Lao \nMekong  plains,  has  a  clear  comparative  advantage  over  its  neighbors  and  considerable \npotential  to  develop  a  commercially  viable  forest  plantations  subsector,  because  it  has: \n(i) suitable climate and site conditions for growing trees;10 (ii) low population density;11 (iii) vast \nareas of degraded forest land; (iv) flat or undulating terrain; (v) an existing road infrastructure \nthat is being upgraded; (vi) access to large markets in neighboring countries; (vii) low costs for \nland lease; and (viii) competitive costs for labor and inputs. To take advantage of global demand \nand its enormous potential, Lao PDR needs to develop the plantations subsector efficiently. \n \n25.  Following completion of TA 3794\u2013LAO12 in March 2003, it became evident that new \ninstitutional arrangements would be needed to overcome constraints that contributed to the \nunsatisfactory  performance  of  the  majority  of  plantations  established  under  ITPP.  It  was \nrecognized  that  a  new  institution  had  to  be  established  to  develop  a  vibrant  plantations \nsubsector  in  Lao  PDR.  Based  on  the  successful  experiences  of  regional  countries,  ADB \nproposed to set up the Lao Plantation Authority (LPA).13 To further explore the options of \ninstitutional and subsector development, the Government set up an Interministerial Working \nGroup (IWG) in May 2004 comprising high-ranking officials from 11 line agencies. To better \nunderstand  the  relevant  existing  institutions  and  corporate  models  in  the  region,  in \nNovember 2004,  ADB  organized  a  regional  study  tour  for  IWG  to  three  countries \n(i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand). Many public organizations, in tandem with private \ncompanies, have successfully supported livelihood, enterprise, and industrial plantations in the \nregion. Their models have a variety of institutional structures but most have autonomous or \nsemiautonomous management. During the regional study tour, IWG closely observed a variety \nof institutions and management models to determine which was suitable for Lao PDR. It was \nmost impressed by FELDA of Malaysia. \n \n26.  To tap the significant potential of this subsector, there is a need to create additional staff \nas  well  as  institutional  capacity  within  the  Government.  The  existing  institutions  are  not \nadequately  staffed  and  do  not  have  the  necessary  skills  and  experience  to  develop  this \n                                                 \n10  Average rainfall ranges from 1,800 millimeters per year (mm/year) to 3,000 mm/year in most of the central and \nsouthern provinces, areas suitable for large industrial plantations. \n11 Population density, at 16/km2 in the same provinces, is much less than in neighboring countries, i.e., 69/km2 in \nCambodia, 120/km2  in Thailand, and 244/km2 in Viet Nam. \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Tree Plantation for \nLivelihood Improvement Project. Manila. (TA\u20133794). \n13 Initially, ADB proposed to set up two separate organizations. One, Lao Plantation Development Corporation, was \nconceived to provide a full-package service to small livelihood plantations. The other, Lao Forest Authority, was to \nfacilitate the operations of multinational plantation companies by providing them with one-window service. There \nare advantages in separating these functions in two organizations. But it would involve some duplication of staff as \nwell as functions. There was also a risk that disagreement or misunderstanding between two organizations could \nlead to confusion. It was, therefore, considered appropriate to set up one organization, which would be structured \nto provide requisite services to both sets of clients. ", "8 \nsubsector. Given the tangible interest of multinational companies and growing demand for \nwood, pulp, and paper in world markets, there is an acute need to create such capacity in Lao \nPDR. It is imperative that LPA be set up as a semiautonomous institution to carry out a variety \nof functions smoothly, by engaging skilled and motivated staff at competitive compensation \npackages. Since LPA is designed to provide full-package service to livelihood planters, it would \nfinance plantation establishment with equity-sharing investment rather than term loans. This \nfinancing arrangement will not require cumbersome credit lines, interim interest payments, or \nsubsidies. LPA\u2019s livelihood plantation operations will be financially viable. \n \n27.  The Government also needs an institution to provide efficient one-window service to \nmultinational companies keen to make FDI in this subsector. The Government has empowered \nits  Department  of  Domestic  and  Foreign  Investment  (DDFI),  under  the  Committee  for \nInvestment and Cooperation, to appraise investment applications in cooperation with agencies \nconcerned.14 But neither DDFI nor MAF has the capacity to deal with the kind of issues and \nprocesses that would facilitate efficient entry of multinational companies in this subsector. For \ninstance, the existing institutions do not have adequate capacity for major tasks such as: \n(i) survey for land-use planning; (ii) negotiations for LLA; (iii) development of technical, financial, \nenvironmental, and social standards and their compliance; and (iv) check for due diligence on \ninvestors. Without such capacity, the transaction cost of establishing industrial plantations and \nassociated processing industry would be high, making the subsector unattractive for national \nand foreign investors. The problem-tree analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The impact of the Project will contribute to steady economic growth, accelerated poverty \nreduction, and improved environmental conservation. The immediate Project objective is to \ndevelop  an  efficient  and  equitable  forest  plantations  subsector  by:  (i)  establishing  a \nsemiautonomous, sustainable, and efficient new institution to support the development of this \nsubsector;  and  (ii)  supporting  financially  viable  livelihood  and  enterprise  plantations,  and \nfacilitating the establishment of industrial plantations and the associated processing industry. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by generating income and employment, creating \nassets for poor households, and raising considerable revenues for the Government. The Project \nwill  create  a  substantial  plantation  resource  base  and  catalyze  large-scale  FDI  in  forest \nplantations, leading to the development of a modern wood processing industry in the medium \nterm.  Plantations  will  be  established  on  degraded  forestlands  (DFL)  that  have  little  or  no \nalternative economic value. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  To meet its objective, the Project will establish LPA as a semiautonomous, sustainable, \nand  efficient  new  institution,  within  MAF,  to  support  development  of  the  subsector.  LPA\u2019s \nbusiness plan will comprise four activities: (i) undertake land-use planning; (ii) support SLPs; \n(iii) facilitate  operations  of  LIPs;  and  (iv)  promote  plantation  enterprise  development  by \nsupporting medium enterprise plantations (MEPs) and small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs).  The  first  activity,  land-use  planning,  is  the  key  to  the  success  of  subsector \n                                                 \n14  DDFI is empowered under the Law on the Promotion and Management of Domestic and Foreign Investment in the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 1994. DDFI is the former Permanent Office of the Foreign Investment \nManagement Committee. It was commonly known by its acronym FIMC.  ", "    9 \ndevelopment. The second activity, with the bulk of project investments, will establish SLPs by \nproviding them full-package service. The third activity will facilitate the entry of multinational pulp \nand paper companies in this subsector to establish LIPs following sustainable environmental \nand  participatory  social  standards,  policies,  and  laws.  The  fourth  activity  will  support  the \ndevelopment of MEPs and the associated SMEs through partial project financing and TA. The \nestablishment of LPA will create adequate staff and institutional capacity to start efficient and \nequitable development of this subsector and tap its considerable potential. \n \n30.  Project Scope. One of the main reasons ITPP was not able to provide effective support \nto planters was that its scope was spread too thinly over seven provinces. Under this Project, \nSLPs will be established in three clusters of about 3,000\u20133,500 ha each in four provinces, \ni.e., Vientiane Capital, Bolikhamxay, Saravane, and Champasack, covering 9,500 ha. These \nthree SLP clusters will be established within a 25\u201330 km radius with one nursery, extension \nsupport, and research and development center for each. Such clusters would provide a critical \nmass of plantations within financially viable proximity. Therefore, LPA will be able to provide \neffective support for training and marketing and supplying planting and protection material. The \noutput from each cluster will eventually provide enough raw materials to support a 30,000 m3 \nper annum capacity medium-density fiberboard plant in the vicinity. Such investments in the \nprocessing industry will follow after raw material supplies have been ensured. These clusters, \ntherefore, will turn out to be efficient economic zones creating new business opportunities for \nupstream and downstream businesses. The site selection criteria and plantation development \nstrategy are in Appendix 4. \n \n31.  Support for livelihood and enterprise plantations in two other provinces (Khammuane \nand Savannakhet) will be arranged through LIPs under the company-community model. The \nimpending start of LIP development in these provinces will open opportunities for SLPs to be \ndeveloped on the periphery of LIPs. Large plantation companies often provide training, planting \nmaterial, and offer buy-back contracts to such communities in the vicinity of their operations in \nmany countries (Indonesia, Brazil, Chile, etc.). LPA will develop such models in detail and \nfacilitate their implementation. \n \n32.  Lao Plantation Authority. LPA will be set up through a prime ministerial decree as a \nsemiautonomous body empowered to: (i) engage qualified staff at competitive salary packages \nset by itself; (ii) open and operate an imprest account(s), in foreign as well as local currencies, \nto manage grant and loan funds from ADB and the Government of Malaysia; (iii) open and \noperate corporate bank accounts, in foreign as well as local currencies, to manage its finances; \n(iv) be financially viable and charge for services rendered; (v) establish SLPs through equity-\nsharing financing arrangements; (vi) recalibrate and refine its overall business and equity-\nsharing models from time to time as may be deemed necessary due to changing circumstances; \n(vii) operate a revolving fund to support SLPs on continuing basis; and (viii) negotiate LLAs with \nLIPs on behalf of the Government. A detailed model of LPA has been prepared that describes \nits mission, structure, mandate, duties, powers and rights, staffing, business model, scope of \nwork, operational costs, revenues, and cash flow (Supplementary Appendix A). LPA will provide \nfull-package service to SLPs and MEPs and one-window service to LIPs. \n \n33.  Land-Use Planning. Identifying suitable DFL for all types and sizes of plantations will be \nthe  first,  and  an  important,  activity  of  LPA.  It  is  critical  that  SLPs  are  established  within \nfinancially viable clusters where support for input supply, extension, and marketing is cost-", "10 \neffective.  Due  to  the  bulky  nature  of  its  output,  haulage  costs  are  high.15  Therefore,  it  is \nimperative to develop the subsector in such a way that critical mass is created in a few selected \nsuitable areas. Initial screening for suitable lands, for all three types and sizes of plantations, \nhas already been completed. A GIS-based plantation atlas has been prepared that will be made \navailable to all interested stakeholders on the Project\u2019s web site. Three SLP clusters, in seven \ndistricts of Vientiane Capital, Bolikhamxay, Saravane, and Champasack provinces, have been \nidentified during project preparation (Appendix 4). LPA will undertake more detailed participatory \nland  surveys  to  precisely  delineate  (25\u201350  ha)  blocks  of  plantation  land  in  each  village \nemploying GPS techniques, and testing soils for suitability following social and environmental \ncriteria.  LPA  will  identify  suitable  lands  for  LIPs  (mainly  in  Khammuane  and  Savannakhet \nprovinces) and MEPs, following a similar procedure. LPA will ensure that lands earmarked for \nforest plantations do not entail better alternative economic uses. \n \n34.  Small Livelihood Plantations. This activity will support the establishment of SLPs to \nimprove the livelihood of poor households in the three target clusters. The aim is to support \naround 2,000 households in establishing financially viable plantations on 9,500 ha by providing \na  full-package  service  through  an  equity-sharing  financing  model.  Each  household  will  be \nallocated on average 3\u20135 ha in blocks of 25\u201350 ha in the vicinity of their village. Land allocation \nwill depend on labor availability and other economic activities of each household. LPA will \nidentify qualified poor households following prescribed criteria and arrange for TLUCs following \nprevailing Government regulations, in consultation with the relevant local authorities. Planters \nwill  be  explained  the  full  details  of  the  equity-sharing  financing  model,  training  program, \nconcepts of clusters, and marketing support. Planters will be grouped according to their blocks \nto receive effective support from LPA and exchange information and help each other. \n \n35.  Large Industrial Plantations. The private sector consultation workshop, organized by \nthe Government with assistance from ADB in Vientiane in August 2004, turned out to be a \nwatershed in the plantation development subsector in Lao PDR. This was the first occasion \nwhen  multinational  pulp  and  paper  companies  were  formally  introduced  to  the  significant \npotential of this subsector in the country and they also interacted with high-level Government \nofficials. Since then, Oji Paper Company of Japan has acquired BGA Lao Plantation, Ltd;16 \nPhoenix Pulp and Paper Company of Thailand has identified 12,000 ha for plantations in \nSavannakhet province; Advance Agro Pulp and Paper, Ltd of Thailand has requested another \n20,000 ha for plantations in Savannakhet province; Aditya Birla Group of India\u2019s Pulp and Fiber \nBusiness has identified 50,000 ha in Savannakhet and Khammuane provinces with an option to \nset up a pulp fiber plant (total investment of about $350 million).17 There are indications that \nmore such companies are on the way to explore opportunities in Lao PDR. It is anticipated that, \nby 2011, LIPs will have been established on at least 70,000 ha. Such strong expression of \ninterest from multinational pulp and paper companies now provides the Government with a \nwindow of opportunity to entice significant FDI in this subsector. \n \n36.  LPA will facilitate the entry of these firms in this subsector by providing one-window \nservice, streamlining currently cumbersome procedures for obtaining all necessary licenses and \npermits.  LPA  will  undertake  due  diligence  of potential  investors  to  ensure  that  companies \n                                                 \n15 Average transport costs by trailer-trucks are about $0.07/ton/km. If the average roadside price near the plantation \nis $13.5/tonne (m3), a 20-tonne load (valued $270) will cost $280 to deliver to a processing plant 200 km away. So, \ntransport costs could be higher than the value of output if distance to market is long.  \n16  BGA Ltd was set up in 1996 by a consortium of foreign investors (mostly from New Zealand); the Government has \n15% share in the company. BGA was granted a land concession over 150,000 ha (about 50,000 ha plantable area) \nin Bolikhamxay and Khammuane provinces. However, to date, it has planted only 1,700 ha due mainly to lack of \ncapital. Most of its plantations have been established with a line of credit from ITPP (footnote 4). \n17  Aditya Birla Group made a formal presentation to the Government on 11 March 2005 in Vientiane. ", "    11 \ninvesting in the subsector meet the highest international standards. Where appropriate and \nrequested, ADB will provide a political risk guarantee (PRG) facility to qualified investors so that \nthey  may  obtain  investment  funds  at  competitive  rates  in  international  capital  markets \n(Appendix 5). LPA will identify suitable lands and negotiate LLAs with LIP companies. LPA will \narrange for third party audits of LIP operations to ensure that they comply with technical, social, \nenvironmental, and financial standards and regulations. \n \n37.  Plantation Enterprise Development. LPA will provide support for MEPs and SMEs. \nQualified MEPs (average size 50\u2013100 ha) will be provided technical, financial, and marketing \nsupport. LPA will assist MEPs to raise most of their financing requirements from local banks by \ndesigning full-term loans. LPA will provide up to 20% ($200/ha) of the requisite financing\u2014on an \nequity-sharing basis\u2014for qualified MEPs covering a total area of about 1,000 ha. The objective \nis to demonstrate a financially viable model that can be jointly supported by LPA and the local \nbanks.  LPA  will  also support  the development  of  associated  SMEs,  i.e., charcoal  making, \nsawmilling,  flooring,  and  furniture  manufacturing.  Such  value  adding  operations  present \nsignificant opportunities to generate employment and raise efficiencies to current practices.18 TA \nwill be provided to about 10 SMEs to develop promising business proposals and feasibility \nstudies. LPA will assist SMEs to generate financing from local banks. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Livelihood Improvement \n \n38.  The  Government  considers  a  person  as  poor  if  one  does  not  have  access  to \n2,100 kilocalories per day, which is roughly the equivalent of an income of $10.25 per capita per \nmonth in current prices.19 The rural poverty line is considered 15\u201320% lower than the urban \npoverty line. In the target provinces, poverty rates range from 30\u201340%, which is about the same \nas the national average of 39%. Women also suffer from poverty in gender-specific ways. \nPoverty for women means having a greater work burden, poorer health, lower education levels, \nless food, and inadequate rest than men. Dependency ratios are high, implying that large \nfamilies are part of strategies to deal with poverty for poor households. Chronic food shortages \nare  common:  rice  shortages  for  3\u20135  months  were  reported  during  participatory  rural \nassessments. The main causes of food shortages are: (i) reduced access to productive land, (ii) \nlack of forest resources, and (iii) inadequate income from NTFPs. Land and forest allocations \nwere stated to be unfair to the poor. Unemployment and underemployment rates among poor \nhouseholds are as high as 50%. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 6. \n \n39.  The Project will address the primary concerns of the poor, generating employment with \ncash income, providing sustainable livelihoods, and creating assets in the form of productive \nplantation land. LPA will facilitate access to TLUCs for poor households. The Government \nissues TLUCs on a 3-year rolling basis. After the initial 3 years, according to this policy, if a \nTLUC holder is determined to have put the land under productive use, TLUCs can be turned \n                                                 \n18  The local/traditional charcoal-making process, using earthen pits, is quite inefficient with a conversion rate of \n<10%. LPA could introduce modern yet simple steel kilns that would improve the conversion rates to >25%. LPA \nmay set up and lease 2\u20133 units for on-farm demonstration on strategic locations. \n19  Based on the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey III (2001), the food poverty line in rural areas was \nKN80,000 per person per month ($9 at 2001 exchange rate). In today\u2019s terms, it is $10.25. This implies that a \nfamily of six should have an income of at least $61.5 per month ($738 per year) to stay above the food poverty line. \nThe value of paddy produced by an average household is $416 (assuming average landholding of 1 ha yielding 3t \npaddy valued at KN1,500 per kilogram) and cash income is $150 per year. Therefore, the total annual income of \nthe average household ($566) is still short by $172 of the food poverty line ($738 per year). The rural poor make up \nthis shortfall by harvesting mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fish, and some game from nearby forests. ", "12 \ninto a permanent land deed. This often does not occur because Government institutions do not \nhave the capacity to survey and certify land use. LPA will establish and maintain a land registry \nand facilitate the implementation of this government policy to turn TLUCs into LUCs at the end \nof first rotation, for participants who have established their credentials as serious planters. The \ntime lag is necessary to discourage land-grabbing tendencies of unscrupulous planters. In each \nvillage, planters will be organized into groups of 20 households so they can access better \nplantation technologies through appropriate and inclusive training and extension services. Land \nallocations will be carried out in full consultation with poor communities. \n \n2.  Environmental Management \n40.  The ITPP PCR noted that Eucalyptus plantations have not demonstrated any adverse \nimpact on the environment. The plantation area to date has been a small portion of the overall \nforested area in these localities (a mere 0.5\u20135.0%) and this ratio will not change significantly \neven  when  LIPs  are  established.  Given  the  amount  of  land  and  land-use  patterns,  forest \nplantations, in terms of area coverage, will remain a modest part of the overall land-use pattern \n(<10%) in Lao PDR. \n \n41.  Monoculture plantations, if not managed properly, can cause harm to soil, water, flora, \nand  fauna.  The  Project\u2019s  plantation  design,  development,  and  management  arrangements \nrecognize the potential environmental issues associated with large-scale eucalyptus plantations. \nThese include: (i) water use and quality; (ii) soil fertility; and (iii) pests, diseases, and fire risks. \nHowever, the conditions in Lao PDR generally, and in the Project area specifically, do not \nwarrant cause for concern. Rainfall in the Project area is 1,800\u20133,000 millimeters (mm) per \nyear.  This  level  of  precipitation  is  more  than  adequate  to  support  Eucalyptus  plantations, \nespecially when their density will be <10% of the overall land-use mosaic. Therefore, there is no \nrisk of water shortages and/or lowering of water tables. Furthermore, plantation site selection, \ndesign and management principles, and standards outlined in the LPA\u2019s Operations Manual \n(Supplementary Appendix C) are consistent with internationally recognized forest plantation \ncertification  systems  and  technical  standards  and  guidelines  that  will  ensure  sustainable \nenvironmental management. These safeguards will effectively prevent and mitigate associated \nrisks. LPA will have the requisite capacity to facilitate the enforcement of relevant standards and \nregulations by organizing third party audits. A summary initial environmental examination is in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \n3.  Stakeholder Consultation \n42.  During  the  implementation  of  the  TA  3794\u2013LAO20  (October  2002  to  April  2003), \nenvironmental impact assessment and resettlement planning consultations were carried out with \nGovernment  agencies,  provincial  departments,  civil  society  organizations,  local  mass \norganizations, and potential beneficiaries. Two workshops and a number of meetings in four \nvillages were organized to seek views from these stakeholders. After the new Project concepts \nwere developed in August 2003, similar consultations were held to seek their views again. A \nprivate sector consultation workshop was organized in August 2004, in which all relevant line \nagencies,  provincial  departments,  international  civil  society  organizations,  and  local  and \ninternational private sector companies participated and supported the new Project concepts. \nADB consultation missions in the intervening period regularly visited the Project areas and \ncarried out village consultations with potential beneficiaries to seek their views on the equity-\nsharing financing model. Consultants under the small-scale technical assistance, TA 4419\u2013\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Tree Plantation for \nLivelihood Improvement Project. Manila. (TA\u20133794) ", "    13 \nLAO,21 have also undertaken two surveys during 2004 and 2005 to assess land-use patterns \nusing GIS maps. A more formal and updated social and environmental impact survey was \nundertaken in July 2005. The survey team visited 15 villages in 3 proposed clusters and held \ndetailed discussions with provincial, district, and village officials, along with villagers. More than \n1,200  villagers  participated  in  these  meetings.  Data  and  information  in  the  resettlement \nframework,  ethnic  minorities  development  framework,  and  gender  action  plan  have  been \nupdated based on survey results. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n43.  The  Project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties is estimated at $15.35 \nmillion  equivalent,  consisting  of  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $6.45 million  (42%)  and  local \ncurrency costs of $8.90 million (58%). Detailed cost estimates are in Table A7.1, Appendix 7. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n44.  The Government of Lao PDR has requested loan of $7.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources and a grant of $3.0 million from the Asian Development Fund to help finance \nthe Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The \nADB grant will be used to support the establishment and bulk of the initial working capital of LPA \nduring the Project period. The Government of Malaysia will provide $652,000 equivalent in \nparallel grant financing.22 The Government will contribute $2.12 million, including the imputed \nvalue  of  land  rents  for  SLPs,  and  taxes  and  duties.  The  beneficiaries  will  make  in-kind \ncontribution of $2.29 million. A detailed financing plan is in Table A7.2, Appendix 7. ADB grant \nrationale and purpose are described in Appendix 8. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n45.  MAF  will  be  the  executing  agency  pending  formal  establishment  of  LPA  following \napproval of LPA decree. Once operational, LPA will be the executing agency. LPA will have a \nboard of directors (BOD), a high-ranking Government official as its managing director (MD), and \na professional chief technical advisor (CTA). Its operations will be divided into four divisions, \nnine units, and one office. Each division will be headed by a director. Livelihood and Industrial \nPlantations  are  operational  divisions,  while  Land-use  Survey  and  Finance  and  Human \nResources are support divisions. The Public Relations Office is attached to the CTA\u2019s office. \nLPA\u2019s structure, functions, list of staff, and their inputs are described in Appendix 9. \n \n46.  As a semiautonomous agency, its BOD will be empowered by the Government, through \na  prime  ministerial  decree,  to  implement  LPA\u2019s  mandate.  BOD  will  approve  LPA:  (i)  staff \nappointments; (ii) quarterly, annual, and long-term work plans; (iii) annual budget and revenue \nmanagement  plan;  (iv)  negotiated  land-lease  agreements  for  enterprise  and  industrial \nplantations; and (v) business proposals for setting up processing industries. More detailed \nfunctions, operating procedures, and conduct of business of BOD are provided in the prime \nministerial decree (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Prepare the Forest Plantations \nSector Project. Manila. \n22  The grant proposal is under consideration by the Government of Malaysia. If it does not materialize, an equal \namount from the loan will be allocated to bridge the gap in financing.  ", "14 \n47.  BOD will be chaired by the Vice Minister of MAF. Other relevant line agencies would be \nrepresented  by  a  deputy  director  general  or  a  higher  level  official.  Provincial  governor(s) \nconcerned would be member(s) of BOD as and when a project of that particular province(s) will \nbe discussed or decided upon. BOD will also have one member each from the Lao private \nsector, and an industry/subsector expert. BOD would ensure that LPA is managed efficiently \nand  transparently.  It  will  appoint  third  party  auditors  to  ensure  compliance  with  financial, \nenvironmental, and social policies, standards, laws, and regulations of the Government. Its \nmembers would disclose conflict of interest in matters under consideration by BOD, if any, and \nwould not be party to or influence such decisions. BOD will comprise the following members: \n \n(i)  Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (Chairperson); \n(ii)  Vice Minister of Finance (Vice Chairperson); \n(iii)  Managing Director, Lao Plantation Authority (Secretary); \n(iv)  Deputy Director General, National Land Development Agency \n(v)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; \n(vi)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Industries and Handicrafts; \n(vii)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Commerce; \n(viii)  Deputy Director General, Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Posts; \n(ix)  Deputy Director General, Committee for Planning and Investment; \n(x)  Deputy Director General, Science, Technology and Environment Agency; \n(xi)  Deputy Director General, Lao Women\u2019s Union; \n(xii)  Provincial governor(s) concerned; \n(xiii)  One member from Lao Chamber of Commerce; and \n(xiv)  A subsector and/or industry expert. \n \n48.  The MD and CTA will be appointed by BOD. The MD will: (i) liaise with BOD, line \nagencies, provinces, and CTA to facilitate the political decision-making process; (ii) represent \nLPA in international forums, i.e., trade fairs, conferences, company and industry meetings; and \n(iii)  represent  the  Government  to  promote  opportunities  of  investment  in  plantations  and \nassociated processing industries in the country. The CTA will: (i) implement LPA\u2019s day-to-day \nfunctions; (ii) prepare corporate work and financial plans, and annual budget for BOD approval; \n(iii) prepare progress reports and technical standards; and (iv) inspire and provide on-the-job \ntraining to LPA\u2019s Lao staff to ensure high standards of service and good morale. \n \n2.  Staffing \n49.  At full strength by year-3, LPA will have a total of 62 part- and full-time employees. LPA \nwill be staffed in stages, based on its work progress, during the first 12\u201318 months after its \ninception. Initially, an interim-CTA (iCTA) will be recruited for about 6 months, and delegated the \nresponsibility to set up office, process initial procurements, and search and shortlist candidates \nfor  the  tenured  CTA  position  and  LPA  staff.  All  staff  positions  will  be  filled  with  qualified \nindividuals, as defined against each position, following a transparent process. The iCTA/CTA \nwill search, shortlist, interview, and select staff. BOD will approve the recruitment of selected \ncandidate(s) after LPA receives concurrence from ADB. \n \n50.  Four  internationally  recruited  experts  (180  person-months)  will  be  engaged.  The \niCTA/CTA will be offered a competitive package, comparable to those provided by similar \nprivate sector multinationals and development agencies. Three experts to support the director, \nLand Survey Division (LSD); director, Finance and Human Resources Division (FHD); and \ndirector, Livelihood Plantation Division will be seconded by the Government of Malaysia from \nFELDA or similar organizations in Malaysia. ADB will finance their allowances from its grant. \nThe 35 nationally recruited professional staff (2,520 person-months) and 24 support staff (1,728 ", "    15 \nperson-months)  will  be  offered  employment  packages  comparable  to  those  provided  by \nmultinational companies operating in Lao PDR, in order to attract and retain highly skilled staff. \nLao  staff  will  also  be  offered  performance-based  bonuses.  All  short-listed  candidates  for \nmanagement  and  professional  staff  positions  will  be  evaluated  by  the  Staff  Selection \nCommittee, comprising one representative each from the Government (MD, LPA), ADB, and the \nGovernment of Malaysia. A detailed list of staff is in Appendix 9. \n \n51.  Suitably qualified Lao nationals will be engaged as directors of divisions and will work \nunder the supervision of respective international experts and iCTA/CTA. On-the-job training will \nbe provided to these staff to take on the responsibilities in the near future, i.e., 3\u20134 years, \nwithout supervision. The expert and director of FHD will develop a staff transition plan at the \noutset to include the necessary training for Lao staff to take on responsibilities performed by \ninternational experts. The duration of the international experts will be largely determined by the \namount  of  time  needed  for  Lao  staff  to  achieve  the  necessary  qualifications,  skills,  and \nexperience. But the iCTA/CTA will be recruited for the full 6-year Project period. The three \nexperts will be seconded for a total of 36 person-months each; full-time for the first 24 months \nand 3 person-months input per year for the next 4 years. Services of short-term consultants for \na total of 12 person-months will also be provided to LPA. They will be engaged periodically \nbased on specific needs. LPA will prepare a request justifying the need, along with terms of \nreference for ADB concurrence, before engaging any short-term consultant. The requisite job \ndescriptions  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  LPA  staff  are  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n52.  The implementation period will be 6 years (2006\u20132011). Most of the first year will be \nspent on establishing LPA, i.e., setting up the office, recruiting necessary staff, establishing \nthree nurseries, and undertaking land-use planning and planter training for the first batch of \n500 ha for SLPs. Substantive operations will start from the middle of the second year of LPA \noperations.  It  is  recognized  that  new  institutions  evolve  slowly,  so  the  start-up  activities \nenvisaged  have  been  allocated  a  reasonable  amount  of  time.  However,  delays  in  actual \nimplementation  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances  must  be  addressed  during  project \nimplementation and the project schedule should be adjusted accordingly. The sequence of \nactivities  ensures  that  no  project  investments  will  be  made  in  plantations  until  adequate \npreparatory steps have been taken to: (i) engage appropriate staff, (ii) undertake participatory \nland-use planning, (iii) set up nurseries of desired quality, and (iv) train participating planters. \nThe indicative project management and implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Procurement \n53.  Goods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  grant  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and \nmaterials will be procured by international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more \nthan $500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 \nto $500,000 equivalent. Where several local suppliers can offer satisfactory service facilities, \nthen vehicles, equipment, civil works, and materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent \nmay be procured under local competitive bidding procedures, or through direct purchase. Final \ndetails for procurement will be determined during project implementation as appropriate. To \ncommence the Project on time, ADB has approved, at the Government\u2019s request, an advance \naction for procurement. The Government has been advised that approval of such advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. ", "16 \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n54.  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  MAF. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. In discussion with the MAF, attention was drawn to the \nsection on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, \nand consultants to observe the highest standards of ethnics in procuring and executing ADB-\nfinanced contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. The Project design \nhas provisions for funds for independent and external auditors. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  LPA, under its charter approved by the prime ministerial decree, will establish a Project \nimprest  account.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2001). The initial combined total amount in the imprest account will \nnot exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not more than 10% of the loan and grant \namounts.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  followed  to  reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate imprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000. \n \n7.  Financial Management, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  Financial Management. LPA will be a non-profit entity. The bulk of its investments will \nbe  made  in  SLPs  (about  85%  of  ADB  loan  amount)  and  a  modest  investment  in  MEPs \n(about 3%). The Government will pass on ADB\u2019s loan to LPA as grant. LPA\u2019s investments in \nboth SLPs and MEPs will be on an equity-sharing basis; all parties will bear risk and share profit \nand loss proportionately.23 LPA will set up a revolving fund to reinvest its recovered equity in \nmore SLPs and MEPs, following the same model and conditions. Since these investments will \nbe  made  on  an  equity-sharing  basis,  there  is  no  relending  rate.  All  LPA  investments  are \ndesigned  to  be  financially  viable.  Since  LPA  will  be  a  non-profit  entity  which  would  be \nreinvesting  recovered  equity  in  more  SLPs  and  MEPs,  passing  Project  funds  from  the \nGovernment to LPA as grant is justified. \n \n57.  Revenue Management. The Government will collect land rents from LIPs. LPA will \nnegotiate land-lease agreements, including land rents, with private sector investors on behalf of \nthe  Government.  Land  rents  will  constitute  two  accounts:  land  lease  fee  (LLF)  and  land \nmanagement fee (LMF). LLF, as economic return of land\u2019s productivity, will be deposited in the \ntreasury  as  Government  revenue.  While  LPA  will  be  authorized  to  receive  LMF,  through \nbudgetary allocation, as its service charge to cover its costs of land-use planning, plantation \nmanagement, and 3rd party audits. LPA will prepare a detailed revenue management plan within \nthe first year. LPA\u2019s annual budget will reflect projections for revenue management for the \nfollowing year and its annual report will show revenue management for the preceding year. \n \n58.  Income and Financial Sustainability. LPA will be fully funded during its 6-year Project \nperiod from ADB loan and grant and by GOM grant technical assistance but it will become \n                                                 \n23 More details on proportion of equity and risk-sharing are provided in Supplementary Appendix A.  ", "    17 \nfinancially self sustaining thereafter. It will have 3 sources of income: (i) revenues from products \nand services provided including seedling sales and commissions on materials and sales of logs; \n(iii) LMF collected as part of land rents from LIPs and MEPs; and (iii) a revolving fund created by \nits share of revenues from SLPs; \n \n59.  Accounting. The FHD of LPA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify the goods and services financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nproject expenditures, and use of local funds. Accounts will be established and maintained in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following Ministry of Finance \nguidelines and procedures as amended from time to time. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be compiled by the FHD and audited annually by independent \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit reports, and related financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. \n \n60.  Audit Reports. The FHD of LPA will prepare concise quarterly reports during each year \nof  implementation,  describing  (i)  physical  and  financial  progress  against  agreed  targets, \n(ii) disbursement of funds at provincial and/or district levels, and (iii) summary of performance \nmonitoring and evaluation (PME) results. In turn, LPA will submit consolidated quarterly and \ncomprehensive  annual  progress  reports  for  BOD  approval  and  onward  submission  to  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Within  3  months  of  project  completion,  LPA  will  prepare  a  project \ncompletion report in the standard ADB format and submit it to the Government, ADB, and GOM. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  PME  will  be  undertaken  for  each  component  to  ensure  that  Project  resources  are \nmanaged efficiently and benefits realized. The CTA will develop a comprehensive PME plan in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  The  PME  will \ninclude  a  participatory  mechanism  to  involve  beneficiaries  in  monitoring.  The  Livelihood \nPlantations  Division  (LPD)  and  Industrial  Plantations  Division  (IPD)  will  be  responsible  for \ncarrying out PME activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through initial baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys, data collection, and analysis. LPA will submit a detailed \nPME implementation plan to prepare benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. LPA will provide annual PME reports to ADB and GOM \nthroughout project implementation. \n \n9.  Project Review \n62.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out  annual  reviews  assessing  the \n(i) progress  of  LPA  development  and  its  effectiveness;  (ii)  capacity-building  activities  and \ntraining programs for LPA staff; and (iii) progress of SLPs, MEPs/SMEs, and LIPs. The first year \nof the Project may require more than one review mission(s). A midterm review will be carried out \nin  year-3.  The  review  will  take  a  comprehensive  stock  of  the  project  implementation  and \ndetermine whether it complies with the original design parameters and that intended benefits \nhave begun to materialize. The midterm review will also give an opportunity to make any \nrequisite refinements or realignments to the Project design. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n63.  The Project\u2019s core investments in SLPs, MEPs, and SMEs will have significant impact on \nthe income of participating planters and entrepreneurs. Financially viable SLPs will create full-\ntime employment for the 2,000 participating households and more than double their annual cash ", "18 \nincome within the first year\u2014from $150 to $384. A typical household with 5 ha allocation will be \npulled above the food poverty line with a constant stream of cash income from labor inputs on \ntheir own plantations for the next 5 years (footnote 19). LPA will compensate participating \nhouseholds for their labor inputs as part of its equity in SLP. From years 8\u201312, households will \nreceive on average over $858/ha/year income as its share of the revenues. These revenues will \nincrease  their  household  cash  income  by  five  times.  In  the  process,  SLPs  will  create  a \nresourceful asset for poor households, who will receive LUCs after year-8 (end of the first \nrotation). Such an increase in income and asset creation will have significant impact not only on \npoverty reduction but also on the general well-being of the average household. With this level of \ncash income, the household will be able to afford basic education, primary health, and more \nnutritious food. The multiplier effect on the village economy, with more opportunities for trade \nand employment, will be just as important. The socioeconomic profile of participating villages \ncould change dramatically within 8\u201310 years. More detailed financial and economic analysis is \nin Appendix 11. \n \n64.  Even if only half the expressions of interest from multinational companies materialize, \nthe pace of development in the forest plantations subsector would be significant. Conservative \nestimates show that as much as 150,000 ha may be under LIPs by 2015. This pace and scale \nof  development  would  create  massive  employment  opportunities\u2014even  10,000  ha/year \ndevelopment will create one million person-days of employment. This situation would result in \nlabor shortages, requiring increasingly mechanized means of plantation management. This \ntransformation would result in higher labor wages, jobs with better skills, higher household \nincome, and a significant multiplier effect on the regional and national economy. \n \n65.  It is assumed that LIPs will launch operations from 2007 by planting about 2,000 ha \ngenerating land rent of $40,000. This estimate assumes land rent of $20/ha/year, which is a \nconservative forecast. At the assumed pace, by 2015, about 150,000 ha would be under LIPs \ngenerating land rents of $3 million per annum. This level of wood production would result in the \nestablishment of an active wood processing industry by the private sector manufacturing pulp, \nmedium density fiberboards, and sawlogs.24 \n \nB.  Social Impacts \n66.  By establishing SLPs on about 9,500 ha, the Project will directly benefit approximately \n2,000 poor households. Poverty levels of beneficiary households are high (39\u201353%), according \nto the Project Social Survey, 2005. SLPs will significantly increase household income, improve \nfood  security,  and  other  social  indicators  for  participating  households  and  communities. \nBeneficiary involvement in Project activities will be entirely voluntary and undertaken following \nparticipatory approaches. \n \n67.  LPA will help develop three main types of plantations, i.e., SLPs, MEPs, and LIPs. \nThese plantations are likely to acquire and convert DFL to forest plantations. In that process, it \n                                                 \n24  Given the prevailing corporate tax rate of 20%, the processing industry would start generating revenues for the \nGovernment in excess of $10 million from 2016, reaching over $40 million by 2020. This level of growth in LIP \ndevelopment and associated processing industry is quite conservative. It is quite likely that, by 2015, LIPs will \ncover about 300,000 ha with an investment of $300 million. LIPs are being planned by industrial processing firms. \nHaving secured this level of woodchip supplies, these firms will set up industrial processing plants for pulp and \npaper,  medium  density  fiberboards,  and  many  other  products.  The  total  industrial  investment  may  exceed \n$1.5 billion, bringing combined investment in the subsector to over $2 billion considering the induced investment in \nup and down stream industries, supply chains, transport, and a variety of trade to service this level of industrial \nactivity. Government revenues in this scenario\u2014from corporate income and other taxes, profits from its own equity, \nand land rents\u2014could exceed $100 million a year. Assuming another, at least twofold multiplier effect, the impact \non GDP would be quite considerable. Value-adding ratios in this subsector are significant: 4 tons of woodchips \nworth about $100 produce one ton of pulp worth $500. ", "    19 \nis likely that in some cases, adverse impacts may be felt in the short-run by current users of \nDFL. Given these risks, the Project has developed a draft Operations Manual (Supplementary \nAppendix C); to address safeguards and compliance issues, including those relating to ethnic \nminority  development  and  involuntary  resettlement.  The  manual  is  in  line  with  the  agreed \nresettlement framework; government policies on resettlement, land-use planning, and related \nlaws and policies; and ADB's social safeguard policies. The draft manual will be submitted to \nADB for approval prior to its use by LPA. All potential investors will need to adhere to ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies as well as related government laws and guidelines. \n \n68.  Ethnic minority households in Project areas will have the option to participate in the SLP \nprogram through participatory land-use planning. To address concerns regarding their ability to \nunderstand  the  SLP  concept\u2014including  the  equity-sharing  financing model,  and  access  to \ntraining,  extension,  technical,  and  market  information\u2014LPA  will  recruit  ethnic \nminority/community  development  officers.  The  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Framework \naddresses these issues in more detail (Supplementary Appendix F). After LPA identifies lands \nfor SLPs, MEPs, and LIPs, specific resettlement and ethnic minority development plans will be \nprepared  following  the  principles,  conditions,  and  procedures  outlined  in  the  frameworks \n(summarized in Appendix 12). \n \n69.  Poor women and women-headed households (less than 10% of all households in the \nProject area) will have equitable opportunities to participate and benefit from Project activities. \nThe process for establishing SLPs will provide full opportunities for women to participate in \ndecision making, through women\u2019s focus group discussions, and the inclusion of women\u2019s \nnames in all agreements between LPA and SLP beneficiaries. Similarly, all T/LUCs will be in the \njoint names of husbands and wives and, in the case of women-headed households, in women\u2019s \nnames.  LUCs  will  be  inheritable.  The  Gender  Action  Plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  F) \naddresses the need for women\u2014particularly ethnic minority women\u2014to get full access to LPA \nactivities. Under LIP, MEP, and SME development, all potential investors will need to agree to \nadhere to the Government\u2019s gender policies and the Gender Action Plan requirement to provide \nequitable access to women for employment, equal wages for equal work, and other benefits. \n \nC.  Project Risks \n70.  The setting up of LPA and large-scale development of forest plantations subsector would \nentail political, institutional, market, business, financial, and environmental risks. But all these \nrisks\u2014individually as well as collectively\u2014can be managed and mitigated. LPA would be able to \neffectively mitigate all risks, except political risk. There are two types of political risks. One \nwould be faced by LPA itself and the other by Lao PDR. To mitigate the risk faced by Lao PDR, \nADB could provide a political risk guarantee to qualified foreign investors. But mitigation of the \nLPA risk would mainly depend on the Government\u2019s commitment to allow LPA to practice its \nautonomy without interference. The Government will provide a commitment at the highest level \nby approving the prime ministerial decree establishing LPA. The Government has also provided \nspecific assurances that have been covenanted in the draft Loan Agreement. More detailed \ndescription of risks and their mitigation measures is in Appendix 13. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given specific assurances \nthat have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  Autonomy for LPA. The Government will grant semiautonomous status to LPA, \nthrough the prime ministerial decree, as envisaged in its model report. ", "20 \n(ii)  Non-interference  in  LPA  operations.  The  day-to-day  management  of  LPA \noperations and the implementation of major functions will rest with CTA. The \nGovernment officials will facilitate its operations approved by its BOD as part of \nthe annual work plan.  \n(iii)  Staff  recruitment  and  management.  The  staff  recruitment  process  will  be \ntransparent  and  competitive,  only  qualified  staff  will  be  engaged  as  per  the \nprescribed qualification criteria against each position. \n(iv)  Implementation of social actions. LPA and all investors will fully adhere to \nADB\u2019s social safeguard policies as agreed to in the Resettlement Framework, \nEthnic Minority Development Framework, and the Gender Action Plan. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n72.  Before loan and grant effectiveness:  \n \n(i)  Prime  ministerial  decree.  The  Government  will  have  approved  the  prime \nministerial decree establishing LPA as a semiautonomous agency.  \n(ii)  LPA plans. Business, revenue management, and annual work plans for LPA will \nhave been prepared.  \n(iii)  Policy refinements. The Government will have commenced harmonizing the \nland-use  and  forestry  regulations  to  allow  LPA  to  prepare  a  \u201cplantation \nmanagement plan\u201d that becomes the basis for all the registrations, permissions, \nand rights relating to development of plantations on a specified parcel of land. \nUnder this plan, LPA will: (a) establish a land registry for all types and sizes of \nplantations; (b) facilitate the issuance of TLUCs for SLPs and land leases for \nMEPs and LIPs; (c) certify the veracity of intended use of TLUCs to convert them \ninto LUCs at the end of first plantation rotation; (d) identify a list of plantation \nspecies for exemption from transit and transport rules across district, provincial, \nand national boundaries. T/LUCs can be transferred and collateralized. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n73.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve \n  \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,911,000 to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Forest Plantations Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $3,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  for  the  Forest \nPlantations Development Project. \n \n \n Haruhiko Kuroda \n28 November 2005               President", "  Appendix 1  21 \nCHRONOLOGY OF PROJECT PROCESSING \n1.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Tree  Plantation  for  Livelihood \nImprovement technical assistance (TA) project1 to prepare a follow-on investment project to the \nIndustrial Tree Plantation Project (ITPP).2 This TA was implemented from October 2002 to April \n2003. It analyzed project scope and design issues, summarized lessons learned from the ITPP, \nand prepared a detailed feasibility for the proposed investment project. An ADB mission visited \nLao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) from 19 June to 4 July 2003 to carry out fact-\nfinding  for  this  Project.3  The  mission  leader  then  proceeded  to  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and \nThailand to study their experiences with plantation development and the related institutional \narrangements. Based on observations made in these three countries and lessons learned from \nITPP, in August 2003, the mission proposed modifications in the design of the new investment \nproject and proposed to set up new institutions to develop this subsector. The Government \naccepted the mission\u2019s recommendations to explore alternative project designs. These concepts \nwere well received by the Government and ADB. In March 2004, the mission made a formal \npresentation of these concepts to Lao Deputy Prime Minister H. E. Somsavath Lengsavad, who \nencouraged the mission to develop models of these concepts.4 Further detailed analyses on \nthese  aspects  and  stakeholder  consultation  were  undertaken  utilizing  the  remaining  TA \nresources (footnote 1). \n \n2.  To  assist  the  mission  in  this  endeavor,  the  Government  set  up  an  Interministerial \nWorking  Group  (IWG)  in  May  2004.  To  present  the  potential  investment  opportunities  to \nmultinational pulp and paper companies, the Government, with assistance from ADB, organized \nthe Private Sector Consultation Workshop in Vientiane in August 2004. This workshop turned \nout to be a watershed in the development of this subsector. Oji Paper Company Ltd of Japan, \nintroduced to such opportunities in Lao PDR for the first time, was so convinced that it acquired \nBGA Plantation Company Ltd within months. Other companies (i.e., Phoenix Pulp and Paper \nLtd. and Advance Agro Pulp and Paper, Ltd of Thailand; and Aditya Birla Group of India\u2019s Pulp \nand  Fiber  Business)  have  also  submitted  formal  expressions  of  interest  to  develop  large \nindustrial plantations and associated processing plants. \n \n3.  In October 2004, ADB approved a small-scale technical assistance, TA 4419\u2013LAO,5 to \nfurther support the processing of this Project. In November 2004, ADB organized a regional \nstudy tour for IWG members to learn from the experience of relevant institutional models in \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.6 Based on the observations made and good examples seen \nduring the study tour\u2014especially that of Federal Land Development Authority of Malaysia\u2014ADB \nproposed that the Government set up Lao Plantation Authority. The Government agreed to this \nproposal during the Loan Fact-Finding Mission in March 2005. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The  overall  scope  of  the  Project  covers  Vientiane  Capital  and  six  provinces,  i.e., \nVientiane, Bolikhamxay, Khammuane, Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champasack. Within these \nprovinces, suitable areas for plantations will be identified using the criteria below. Given the \ninfrastructure and site conditions, multinational companies are keen to establish large industrial \nplantations (LIPs) in Bolikhamxay, Khammuane, and Savannakhet provinces. In these three \nprovinces, small livelihood plantations (SLPs) will be supported through a company-community \nmodel in coordination with LIPs. Therefore, the Project supported core SLP clusters will be \nestablished in: (i) Vientiane Capital, (ii) Bolikhamxay province, and (iii) adjacent districts of \nSaravane and Champasack provinces. The districts where these clusters will be located are \nshown in Table A4. \n \nTable A4: Identified Districts for Three Clusters \n \nCluster       Province       District \nCluster 1   Vientiane Capital  Maypakngum \nXathany \nCluster 2  Bolikhamxay  Paksan \nBolikhan \nCluster 3  Saravane  Lao Ngum \n  Champasack  Bachiangchaluensook \nSanasombon \nNote: Saravane and Champasack have a combined cluster. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.  Under the Project, SLPs will be established on about 9,500 hectares (ha) which will be \ndivided more or less equally among three core clusters with 3,000\u20133,500 ha in each. In addition, \nthe core clusters already have areas of plantations established by the Industrial Tree Plantation \nProject (ITPP).1 It is estimated that there are at least 700\u20131,000 ha of ITPP plantations within \neach of the core clusters. The Project will also support around 1,000 ha of medium enterprise \nplantations (MEPs). As much as possible, these will also be established within the core cluster \nareas, giving an additional area of around 300\u2013400 ha in each cluster. These three types of \nplantations  would  create  a  combined  area  of  about  5,000  ha  per  core  cluster,  which  is \nconsidered to be an appropriate size to capture the scale economies for providing extension, \nharvesting, and transport services and wood processing capacity. \n \nA.  Site Selection Criteria \n3.  Four  criteria  have  been/will  be  used  in  selecting  sites  for  core  clusters/degraded \nforestland  (DFL)  within  these  clusters  for  SLPs:  (i)  markets,  (ii)  site  conditions,  (iii)  labor \navailability, and (iv) incidence of poverty. These criteria are to some extent correlated and the \nconditions that trigger the rejection of sites under each of the criteria are subject to change to \nsome degree over time. Thus, sites that may be rejected now could be acceptable at a future \ndate. Two criteria are physical and two social, and each has economic consequences. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993.

(Loan 1295\u2013LAO). ", "  Appendix 4  27 \n1.  Markets \n4.  For any production system, the input and output markets is a key factor. Therefore, the \nrelationship between the production site and markets for the produce is critical. However, the \nnature of this relationship changes over time and varies with the product type. With forest \nproduction systems, there are a wide range of products that vary over time. For timber products, \nthere is a price-size curve that is generally \u201cS\u201d shaped. Small logs, mainly used for fuelwood, \nhave a low price, and medium logs for pulp or composite panel manufacture command a slightly \nhigher price. Large logs, for sawmilling and manufacture of joinery, furniture and construction \nmaterial, command a 30\u201335% higher price. Logs with diameter >50 centimeters (cm) command \nhigher prices for certain species and special end uses. \n \n5.  The markets for each of these product categories also vary. Fuelwood is normally sold \nlocally or consumed by the producers. But it may also be used for charcoal-making, which has a \nwide range of potential markets. High quality charcoal is shipped half way round the world. \nPulpwood and chipwood are specialized markets and are dependent on processing capacity. \nSince there are generally few plants in the area, their location is known at the outset, so a \nhaulage cost that enables the grower to achieve an acceptable price can be determined. At the \nsame time, there are enormous economies of scale that apply to both pulp and composite panel \nmanufacture, so processing plants tend to be large. The maximum distance for pulpwood for an \nexisting pulp mill is dependent on distribution of existing plantations and available modes of \ntransport. However, the large volumes required by a mill mean that an assured and large \nvolume at a long distance may be preferable to a closer yet unreliable and scattered supply. \n \n6.  World demand for pulp and paper, hence wood fiber, is growing steadily and many \nmultinational companies are planning to expand their capacity. Since many of their existing mills \nhave limitations on their raw material supply, these companies are more likely to build new \ncapacity wherever they can find new resources, rather than expand their existing plants. Thus, \nlack of an existing market for pulpwood within an economic distance does not exclude a site if \nthere is sufficient potential for raw material within a reasonable radius of a site where a pulp mill \ncould be set up in future. The same logic would apply to a medium density fiberboard (MDF) \nplant with a substantially lower raw material requirement than a pulp mill. \n \n7.  Part of the Project strategy is to promote a sufficiently large area of industrial plantations \nto attract 1\u20132 pulp mills and a few MDF plants to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR) in the near future. It is possible to identify the most likely sites for such plants by applying \ncriteria\u2014accessibility, availability of labor, power, and water\u2014that limit the choice of potential \nsites. Establishing plantations on speculation that a plant will be built in the future increases \nrisks for planters. However, Lao Plantation Authority (LPA) will apply robust criteria to select \nappropriate sites for clusters and determine whether aggregate area within clusters would be \nsufficient to attract investments in processing plants by the private sector. Experience in other \ncountries, where extensive plantations have been established without processing plants, shows \nthat they follow once raw material supplies reach a critical mass. The advantage of forest \nplantations is that planters can leave the trees growing for a few more years until more attractive \nprices are offered. The trees, in the meantime, will continue to grow and add value. \n \n8.  An important factor related to location is the minimum plantation area required to ensure \nsustainable raw material supplies to a variety of processing plants. Markets are quickly emerging \naround the selected core clusters. Good all-weather roads permit vehicles to provide economical \ntransport. The prevailing average roadside price around these clusters, $13.5 per cubic meter (m3), \nis enough to make a plantation with mean annual increment (MAI) of 16 m3/ha (yield class [YC] 16) \nfinancially viable. In 5\u20137 years, about 5,000 ha of productive plantations in each cluster could \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \npotentially supply 60,000 m3/year of wood; enough raw material to feed a medium-sized MDF \nmanufacturing plant (set up with an investment of $5 million). \n \n2.  Site Conditions \n9.  Site selection is as important as the location. It means that DFL with suitable soil \nproperties and appropriate hydrology and topography should be chosen for forest plantations. \nThe following criteria will be applied in selecting DFL for forest plantations: (i) crown density \nmust be <20%; (ii) lands within a designated National Biodiversity Conservation Area should be \nexcluded; (iii) soil slope should be <20\u00b0 to avoid risk of soil damage and erosion; and (iv) a safe \ndistance,  about  100  m,  should  be  maintained  from  water  bodies  (streams,  lakes,  canals, \nwatercourses). Sites with slopes >20\u00b0 will be costlier to harvest in the future. From geographic \ninformation system (GIS) data and field surveys, it is clear that DFL on flatter land is not \nhomogenous and includes a range of conditions from more or less grassland, through varying \ndegrees of scrub and bush to secondary forest. Somewhere along the continuum, there would \nbe a point at which the secondary forest is sufficiently well stocked with useful species that it \nshould be left to regenerate naturally. LPA will survey such area and determine its classification, \ndepending on a number of factors\u2014size and diameter distribution of trees by species and their \nquality, and threats that may affect regeneration. \n \n10.  Having eliminated areas of DFL within National Biodiversity Conservation Areas\u2014on \nsteeper slopes, away from water bodies, with the capacity to regenerate naturally\u2014attention \nshould be paid to soil conditions. Acid, shallow and/or compacted, and unduly rocky soils should \nbe avoided as these soils will reduce plant growth and require higher inputs of fertilizers and \nmanagement. Only those soils that would ensure a YC16 or more should be selected. While \nselecting DFL for forest plantations, it would be important to consider alternative land uses. DFL \nthat meet the above criteria, but have a high opportunity cost because they are suitable for uses \nthat yield higher returns than forest plantations, should be excluded. This would exclude fertile \nand flatter lands near settlements where forestry activities are normally unable to compete. \n \n11.  Finally, the amount of suitable DFL that meets these criteria within a village, and/or \nwithin  a  group  of  neighboring  villages,  is  important.  In  order  to  minimize  market  risk  and \nmaximize prices, it is imperative to establish forest plantations on at least 3,000\u20135,000 ha within \na radius of about 25 kilometers (km) from an existing or potential site of a processing plant. \nSuch a cluster of forest plantations should be able to supply 50,000\u201370,000 m3 annually in a \nsustainable manner. The total land area within a 25 km radius is about 200 km2 (200,000 ha), \nimplying that forest plantations would only constitute <0.025% of the total area. \n \n12.  To provide a cost-effective extension service and capture economies of scale for future \nharvesting  and  marketing  of  plantation  logs,  LPA  will  select  villages  where  at  least  20 \nhouseholds want to participate in a block of about 100 ha (assuming average DFL allocation of \n5 ha per household). This area will eventually produce a sustainable annual output of around \n2,000 m3 of timber, which is enough to fill 2\u20133 trucks every week. Some 3\u20134 such subclusters \nproducing 6,000-8,000 m3 annually within a radius of 5\u201310 km would keep one truck fully \noccupied year-round hauling the produce 30\u201350 km to market. About 10 such subclusters within \nthe wider radius of around 25 km would meet the minimum marketing requirements. Hence, a \nlocal transport industry would also evolve, creating more jobs and trade opportunities, and \nproviding cost effective transport. An illustrative layout of SLP subclusters within the core cluster \nis provided in Figure A4.1. \n \n13.  The  two  elements  of  site  selection  criteria  described  above  will  establish  SLPs  in \nclusters and lead to further efficiencies, such as the following. ", "  Appendix 4  29 \n(i)  Planters would gain adequate competence as forest plantations become a major \ncrop in the area; in time, they will learn from each other and become less reliant \non LPA\u2019s extension service. \n(ii)  For LPA, larger-scale operations will be more efficient and cost-effective for land-\nuse planning, socio-technical planning, site selection, and extension.   \n(iii)  Service  delivery,  monitoring,  and  management  supervision  will  become  cost \neffective as households will be grouped in subclusters and concentrated in a \nlimited area. \n(iv)  Well  trained  workforce  will  emerge  to  provide  specialized  harvesting  and \ntransport services.  \n(v)  Mechanical land clearing, through subcontracting, will become cost-effective.  \n(vi)  Road construction and maintenance cost could be financed from plantation cess. \n(vii)  Forest  plantations  in  blocks  will  provide  economies  of  scale  in  fencing  and \nmaintaining firebreak belts. \n(viii)  A concentrated resource base in a cluster will make it feasible to set up a group \ncertification scheme (within the Forest Stewardship Council system).   \n(ix)  Cluster  forest  plantations  of  some  magnitude  may  qualify  for  and  become \nattractive to carbon credit agreements. \n \nFigure A4.1: Distribution Model of Subclusters for Small Livelihood Plantations \nto Minimize Transaction Costs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRadius 5 km, \n  gross area 8,000 ha \n  plantation area 500 ha, \n  one-truck full-time \nannual production \n \n>8,000 m3\n \n \n \nVillage with \n \n100 ha \n  plantations\nRadius 25 km, \n \ngross area 198,000 ha \n  plantation area 5,000 ha, \n  10 trucks fulltime, annual \n  production>80,000m3\n \n \n  ha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3 = cubic meters. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. ", "30  Appendix 4 \n3.  Labor Availability \n14.  Establishing and maintaining a forest plantation requires that a sufficient amount of labor \nis available, preferably from household members. Planters could use part of the cash equity \nfinanced by LPA to hire some casual labor, depending on the opportunity cost of family labor. \nPlanters that are currently able to produce surplus agricultural commodities may prefer to hire \ncasual labor, in which case family labor does not become a limiting factor. For poorer planters \nwith low agricultural productivity, cash income for labor is likely to be more important. For such \nhouseholds, the allocation of DFL will be constrained by the number of family members that can \nwork on plantations. Most plantation work is not particularly heavy, so it could be undertaken by \nwomen and teenage children. A typical calendar for farm labor requirement in the lower Mekong \nplains has been prepared to ascertain the availability of excess household labor and determine \na possible conflict in timing of farm and plantation operations (Supplementary Appendix A). The \ncalendar shows, a household of two adults and a teenage child cultivating one ha of paddy \ncould easily establish and maintain a 5-ha plantation in 5 years (establishing 1 ha per year). As \na guide, the following recommendations are made for allocating DFL based on household labor \navailability: \n(i)  households with only one available worker: 0.5 ha; \n(ii)  households with two available workers: 1.5 ha if planted in a single year or up to \n4 ha if planted over several years but not more than 0.8 ha per year; and \n(iii)  households with more than two available workers: 2\u20133 ha if planted in a single \nyear or up to 5 ha if planted over 3\u20135 years. \n \n4.  Incidence of Poverty \n15.  Poverty reduction is one of the primary objectives of the Project, so high incidence of \npoverty is one of the main criteria for selecting participating villages. However, poverty has \nseveral dimensions and causes; among them is remoteness, which implies lack of access to \nmarkets  and  social  services.  Some  communities  with  high  incidence  of  poverty  may  be \nexcluded from the Project due to unsuitable soil quality and/or lack of access to markets. \nExperience  with  ITPP  has  shown  that  failure  to  achieve  a  reasonable  level  of  plantation \nproductivity may actually aggravate poverty. Therefore, great care will be taken while dealing \nwith communities where there is a high incidence of poverty but other criteria are not fully met. \n \nB.  Initial Selection Procedure \n16.  During  project  preparation,  the  Lao  Plantation  Atlas,  employing  GIS  database,  was \nprepared (can be accessed from the Project web site). It provides detailed maps of relevant \nprovinces showing land-use patterns, geography, road network, other infrastructure, existing \nforest industry and plantations, as well as environmental and social indicators. Based on this \natlas and the above criteria, three core clusters have been identified in suitable localities. The \nselection procedure is shown in Figure A4.2.

Plantation Development Strategy \n17.  The DFL selection criteria, described above, lead to a clear plantation development \nstrategy. Preliminary screening of potential sites in the seven Project provinces for all three \ntypes of plantations (SLPs, MEPs, and LIPs) undertaken during project preparation, indicates \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nthat it is appropriate and feasible. The strategy has a two-track approach. LPA will adopt the \ntrack 1 approach, to identify DFL for LIPs. Initial screening has indicated that extensive tracts of \nDFL, suitable for LIPs, are mostly located in Khammuane and Savannakhet, and to lesser \nextent in Bolikhamxay provinces. After a relatively low intensity ground check, LPA will prepare \nprospectus for these areas. Potential foreign investors, mainly pulp and paper companies, will \nthen be invited to apply for a prospecting license to undertake more detailed participatory \nsurveys in coordination with the local communities and authorities. The prospecting license will \ngive investors exclusive rights for 2 years in well-defined areas, to survey, identify, negotiate, \nand delineate DFL to lease for establishing LIPs.2  \n \n18.  Track  2  will  identify  DFL  for  SLPs  (and  MEPs)  following  the  selection  criteria  and \nprocedure as  described  above  (and  in  Figure  A4.2).  The  SLP  target  under  the  Project  is \n9,500 ha.  Preliminary  screening  has  indicated  that  this  area  could  easily  be  found  within \n6 districts in 3 clusters as described in Table A4. If the detailed selection procedure does not \nidentify the full target area in these districts, then the process will be extended to neighboring \ndistricts.  \n \nD.  Plantation Management and Compliant Redress Mechanism \n19.  LPA\u2019s  plantation  extension  officer  will  work  with  the  selected  groups  (and  other \ncommunity members, as appropriate) to plan how the Project will be implemented locally, \nincluding  building  capacity  for  sustainable  local  management.  Both  a  basic  self-monitoring \nprocess and a communication plan will be developed. Discussion will be held to determine \nprocedures and key features that constitute success (i.e., indicators). Procedures would involve \nsemiannual meetings and/or setting up a subcommittee (with rules for selection and rotation of \nmembers  and  defined  roles  and  responsibilities)  to  assess  progress  and  report  to  project \nofficials on any emerging issues that require outside assistance. Key features might include: \n(i) technical  aspects,  such  as  adequate  plantation  growth  and  appropriate  management  of \ninputs; and (ii) social/institutional elements, such as proper record keeping, receipt of contract \ndocuments, adequate planning for collective sales of produce, appropriate and timely technical \nand financial planning for purchase of inputs for regeneration after each cycle and replanting \nafter 2\u20133 rotations, as needed. In addition, the group as a whole should agree on a plan for \nmanaging any shortcomings they detect when reviewing their own progress. A communication \nplan  will  also  be  prepared.  Community  members  must  know  who  they,  or  their  chosen \nrepresentative, should contact for technical or capacity-building support (for example, financial \nor conflict management facilitation), and, if necessary, how to register complaints or grievances \nwith project management, and the maximum time they should wait for a response. The Project \nwill ensure that staff are available to provide training in long-term technical, managerial, and \nfinancial planning, and respond to community requests and complaints. A complaint redress \nmechanism, as part of the communication plan, will be set up in the Public Relations Office. \n                                                 \n2  This arrangement is similar to BGA Lao Plantation, Ltd\u2019s concession but it will give a shorter time limit to new \ninvestors to take expeditious action to establish LIPs or yield to other interested investors.  ", "  Appendix 5  33 \nPOLITICAL RISK GUARANTEE FACILITY \n1.  In  addition  to  equity  and  debt  financing,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  also \nprovides various types of credit enhancement products. Among them is political risk guarantee \n(PRG) which is provided to investors (for tier-two capital, i.e., shareholder loans and loan \nguarantees) and financial institutions to cover risks that they cannot easily absorb or manage on \ntheir own. Mitigating these risks can make a crucial difference in mobilizing long-term financing, \nespecially for private sector projects. While ADB guarantees provide explicit protection against \nperceived political risks, investors and lenders also take comfort with the implicit protection \nafforded by ADB's involvement in a project (e.g., investment disputes between parties can be \nresolved quicker and more amicably). \n \n2.  Through this Project, the Government wishes to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in \nthe forest plantations subsector. Given the significant opportunities for FDI in this subsector, \nlarge amounts of financing will be required from investors and commercial lenders to achieve \nthe Government\u2019s development objectives. Because the Government does not have a long-\nstanding track record with FDI, investors and commercial lenders may require a PRG to protect \ntheir  loans  against  perceived  political  risks  associated  with  the  region,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the forest plantations subsector. \n \n3.  Under this Project, a PRG facility (the Facility) will be established for investors and \ncommercial lenders, covering eligible loans in the forest plantations subsector against perceived \npolitical risks in Lao PDR. The size of the Facility will be $400 million, backed by $200 million \nfrom ADB ordinary capital resources, and $200 million from external resources provided by \ncommercial and official political risk insurers through reinsurance.1 ADB\u2019s gross exposure in the \nFacility will be $400 million and net exposure will be $200 million. ADB\u2019s net exposure will be \ncounter-guaranteed by the Government. The Guaranteed Percentage will be up to 100%. The \nterm of each PRG will be up to 30 years. \n \n4.  The purpose of the Facility is to enable ADB to respond more flexibly to requests from \ninvestors  and  financial  institutions  for  its  guarantee  instruments,  without  compromising  its \nenvironmental policies and procedures, and social safeguards. Under the Facility, ADB will \nprovide PRG to investors and commercial lenders (Guarantee Holders) covering eligible loans. \nPRG will guarantee payment of debt as a result of the following risks: currency inconvertibility \nand  or  non-transfer,  expropriation,  breach  of  contract,  and  political  violence  (including \nterrorism). The Facility will not cover commercial risks. \n \n5.  The annual fee for each PRG will be paid by the Guarantee Holder. The fee will be \nmarket-based. The Guarantee Holder will also pay a one-time front-end fee of up to 1%. ADB \nwill require reinsurers to have a minimum investment rating to be acceptable for reinsurance. \nADB will also charge a ceding commission to the reinsurers to cover costs associated with \nadministering the reinsurance. The ceding commission will be market-based. Both the fee for \neach PRG and the ceding commission will be approved by the Guarantee Committee of ADB. \n \n                                                 \n1  Reinsurance is defined as acceptance by an insurer, called a reinsurer, of all or part of the risk of loss of another \ninsurer. In exchange, the reinsurer is paid a portion of the premium corresponding to the amount reinsured, less a \nceding commission. \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.

There are large areas in the seven project provinces that are categorized \nas degraded forests. Such degradation of forests can affect livelihoods adversely. Therefore, the Government has \ndetermined to reduce poverty and tap the poverty reduction potential of forest plantation development.

", "  Appendix 8  37 \nGRANT RATIONALE AND PURPOSE \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide $10 million financing for the Project. \nThe Project will assist the Government set up a new institution, Lao Plantation Authority (LPA). \nSince this is a creative new initiative, the Government is requesting a grant of $3 million from \nthe Asian Development Fund (ADF) to help finance operations in its formative years. ADF has \nallocated half of the program amount for Lao PDR as grant.1 ADF allocation for the Project is \nidentified in the Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008. \n \n2.  Rationale. The grant under this Project will be used to establish and then operate LPA \nfor the 6-year Project period. Since LPA is being set up as a new semiautonomous institution\u2014\nan unprecedented development in Lao PDR\u2014the Government is reluctant to borrow for this \nventure. The grant is justified because LPA will set new standards of excellence by employing \nrelatively inexperienced but well-educated and bright local staff at competitive salary packages \nalong with performance bonuses. The position of chief technical advisor (CTA) will also be \nfunded  with  this  grant.  This  institutional  arrangement  will  ensure  that  requisite  capacity  is \ncreated to develop the subsector in line with its potential. The Government will ensure its \nfinancial  sustainability  beyond  the  Project  life  by  providing  it  a  legal  remit,  through  prime \nministerial decree, to: (i) recover and retain its share of the revenues from investments in \nplantations; (ii) charge for its services and retain its income; and (iii) receive part of the land \nrents, as land management fee, from large industrial plantations (LIPs) to defray its service \ncosts. This grant will also catalyze further parallel grant cofinancing from the Government of \nMalaysia, which will second three experts to head three LPA divisions. Therefore, the Project \ngrant is a special feature, without which, LPA might not have been established. LPA will play a \ncritical role in implementing the Project and developing the plantations subsector efficiently and \nexpeditiously. The full-scale model of LPA is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n3.  Proposed  Grant  Activities.  Establishment  of  productive  forest  plantations  requires \neffective land-use planning, extension and training, appropriate modes of financing, and efficient \nmarketing. Existing institutions in Lao PDR have weak capacity to provide effective support to \nforest plantations that require a specific set of expertise. Such skills cannot be gained without \nengaging experts with a proven track record from elsewhere and providing hands-on training to \nappropriately compensated and motivated local staff. Therefore, it is necessary to set up an \ninstitution like LPA that could create the requisite institutional and staff capacity by engaging the \nrelevant experts from overseas in the medium term. Given the significant potential of this \nsubsector in Lao PDR and the ominous signs of its rapid development, LPA will help the \nGovernment take advantage of these opportunities. LPA will provide an effective full-package \nservice to small livelihood and medium enterprise plantations, and small and medium-sized \nenterprises; and one-window service to LIPs. A semiautonomous and appropriately staffed LPA \nwill bridge the capacity gap in a short period and later create capacity among local staff through \na  staff  transition  plan.  By  the  end  of  the  6-year  Project  period,  LPA  will  be  a  premier \nGovernment agency mainly staffed by local experts, with the possible exception of the CTA. \n \n4.  Monitoring and Evaluation. Grant effectiveness will be assessed within the broader \ncontext of project performance. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework (Appendix 3) \nhas clear indicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs financed through the grant. \nThe outcomes and impacts are closely aligned to the Government\u2019s strategies. \n                                                 \n1 As per the Staff Instructions, memo of DG, SPD dated 16 November 2004 approved by the President, up to 50% of \nthe total program assistance to Lao PDR can be provided as grant. \n ", "38  Appendix 9 \nSTRUCTURE, STAFF, AND FUNCTIONS OF THE LAO PLANTATION AUTHORITY  \n1.

Introduction \n1.  The goal of the Project is to reduce poverty and spur economic growth by developing the \nforest plantations subsector in Lao PDR. The immediate purpose is to set up an effective \ninstitution that supports livelihood plantations and acts as a catalyst to attract large-scale foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) for industrial plantations and subsequent development of a modern and \nefficient  wood  processing  industry,  generating  considerable  employment  and  government \nrevenues. The bulk of the project funds will be invested in supporting livelihood plantations that \nwould significantly contribute to poverty reduction among participating households.  \n \n2.  The  Project  will  establish  Lao  Plantation  Authority  (LPA),  whose  business  plan  will \ncomprise  three  main  activities:  (i)  support  small  livelihood  plantations  (SLPs),  (ii)  facilitate \noperations  of  large  industrial  plantations  (LIPs),  and  (iii)  promote  plantation  enterprise \ndevelopment by supporting medium enterprise plantations (MEPs) and small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs). LPA, as a semiautonomous and financially sustainable body, will be the \nexecuting agency of the Project. It will provide full-package service to SLPs, MEPs, and SMEs. \nLPA  will  finance  SLPs  and  MEPs  through  an  equity-sharing  model  and  support  business \ndevelopment of SMEs through technical assistance. All financing arrangements will be in hard \ncurrency on market-based terms, and financially viable. No indirect or direct subsidies will be \nneeded and none provided.  \n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n3.  The Project will generate a variety of direct, indirect, quantifiable, and nonquantifiable \nbenefits. The direct and quantifiable benefits will accrue to SLPs, MEPs, and SMEs. LIPs will \nget direct but unquantifiable benefits as LPA will facilitate land-use survey and planning, and \nnegotiate land lease agreements with them on behalf of the Government. LPA\u2019s facilitating role \nwill significantly reduce the transaction cost of FDI in this subsector. Plantations of all types will \ngenerate significant direct employment in down- and upstream trade and supply chains. LIPs \nwill generate large sums of revenues in land rents as well as in corporate income and local \ntaxes. Similarly, MEPs and SMEs will generate employment and revenues. The most important \nsocial impact will be on poverty reduction\u2014a direct outcome of SLP operations. Increased \ngovernment revenues will have significant impact on poverty reduction at the national level, as a \nresult of increased investments in social development. \n \nC.  Financial and Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Financial Analysis of Plantation Models \n4.  Most direct and quantified benefits of the Project will stem from three main sources: \n(i) return from SLPs; (ii) land rents from LIPs; and (iii) to lesser extent, returns from MEPs and \nSMEs. Financial analyses focus on three plantation models, i.e., SLP, MEP, and LIP. SLPs \nwould be established and managed by poor households. Land (3\u20135 ha per household) will be \ninitially allocated by issuing temporary land-use certificates (TLUCs). The size of land allocation \nto each household will depend on the family\u2019s labor availability. The participating household will \nestablish a plantation on about one ha per year. MEPs will be established by individuals or small \ncompanies on their own, leased, or purchased lands. MEPs plantation size would be 50\u2013100 \nha. LIPs would be established on >5,000 ha lands leased from the Government. ", "  Appendix 11  45 \n5.  To  examine  the  financial  viability,  1-ha  models  for  each  of  these  three  types  of \nplantations have been developed.1 These models are for growing Eucalyptus established and \nmanaged according to current best practices. Based on field survey of the Industrial Tree \nPlantation Project (ITPP)2 plantations, yield tables for Eucalyptus were generated. Since limited \ndata are available for Acacia mangium in Lao PDR, Eucalyptus yield tables can be used for both \nspecies, with the necessary adjustments. Current market prices for inputs (seedlings, fertilizers, \ninsecticides, fencing material, machine rentals, etc.) were used in these models. Daily labor \nwage varies significantly in Vientiane Capital and other provinces. Average wage rate of $1.5 \n(KN15,000) per day was used in the analysis. Many potential products from plantation wood \n(fuelwood from thinning and charcoal manufactured from roots and stumps collected during land \nclearing) have good financial value but were not included in the analysis. \n \n6.  Financial analysis was carried out using constant 2005 prices. Input and output prices \nwere converted to US dollars at the current exchange rate. The base case uses yield class \n(YC)3 16 for SLPs, YC20 for MEPs, and YC24 for LIPs. The weighted average cost of capital \nwas estimated to be about 1%. To estimate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), a 24-year \ntime horizon was used, including original rotation and two coppice rotations. Sensitivity analysis \nwas undertaken by varying the key factors, i.e., YC, labor substitution with machinery, log \nprices, and land rents. \n \n7.  The  results  show  that  plantations  are  financially  viable  (Table  A11.1).  Sensitivity \nanalyses show that FIRR is sensitive to labor substitution with machinery. This is evident by \nFIRRs for YC20 for all three types of plantations; use/cost of machinery increases from MEP to \nLIP. YC is the most important determinant of financial viability. Therefore, site selection is critical \nfor the success of plantations in almost all circumstances. SLPs and MEPs should only be \nestablished on sites where, at least, YC16 could be attained. Similarly, LIPs should preferably \nplan for, at least, YC20. Proximity to markets is critical for the success of plantations\u2014about half \nof the price at mill-gate 250 km from plantation would, on average, be the transportation cost. \nThe Project design has taken this factor into account and introduced the concept of clusters \n(Appendix 4) to ensure adequate density of plantations within reasonable distance, i.e., 25\u2013\n75 km to market. For sites of YC20 or better, rotation for 20%\u201325% of the stock may be \nextended to 10 years (or more) to take advantage of the (30%\u201335%) higher prices of sawlogs. \n \nTable A11.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return of Eucalyptus Plantations in Lao PDR \n \nLand Rent  Yield Class 16  Yield Class 20  Yield Class 24 \n($/ha/year)  $10  $20  $20  $30  $40  $30  $40  $50 \nPlanter  Area  FIRR \n(ha)a  (%) \nLivelihood    25  13  12  16  15  14       \nEnterprise   100  12  10  14  13  12  16  15  14 \nIndustrial  >200      13  12  11  15  14  13 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, ha = hectare. \na Area in blocks to minimize fencing costs; log price assumed $13.5/m3 at roadside. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \na.  Equity-Sharing Model for Small Livelihood Plantations \n8.  Under ITPP, livelihood planters were provided with credit to establish plantations, on \naverage, about $600\u2013$1,000 per ha. The credit was subsidized at 7% per annum in kip, which \n                                                 \n1  More detailed description, data, and tables are provided in the Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  ADB. 1993.

(Loan 1295\u2013LAO). \n3  Yield class 16 implies a yield of 16m3/ha/year. \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nis prone to inflation and devaluation. Therefore, given the high rates of inflation and currency \nexchange, even the full worth of the principal in real terms will not be recovered from the \nmajority of ITPP borrowers. The interest payments fell due within a year of borrowing. This was \na rather unfavorable arrangement on many counts\u2014not least, because poor planters had no \ncash income in the early years of planting and yet were required to make interest payments for \nthe credit. In fact, there was no need for subsidized credit, especially in kip, if the operation was \ndesigned to be productive and financially viable. The ITPP subsidized credit scheme attracted \nmany who were not serious about establishing productive plantations and/or did not plant the \nfull area declared in their credit applications. \n \n9.  Given the long (8-year) plantation production cycle, such investments bear an inherent \nrisk. Throughout the production cycle, but especially in the first 3 years, plantations require \nsound and continued technical support. At the end of the 8-year cycle, they need efficient \nmarketing services to fetch fair prices. Therefore, under the Project, LPA will adopt a profit and \nloss-sharing equity model to finance SLPs. A 1-ha SLP model is in Table A11.2. For 1-ha SLPs, \nthe total (input) variable cost amounts to about $713/ha. The bulk (70%) of input costs is \nrequired during year-1. Input costs decrease progressively by year-2 (15%) and year-3 (9%). \nHarvesting cost, in year-8, is about 7% of the total production cost. Although the model shows \nthat the planter would provide all the labor, LPA will compensate the planter for the full cost of \nlabor in year-1, and up to 50% for that of year-2 and year-3. The total payout for labor costs \nduring the first 3 years, from LPA to planter, would be $313. Other than direct input costs, LPA\u2019s \nequity will also include $30/ha/year for the first 3 years as the extension service cost, and $10 \nfor harvesting and marketing supervision in year-8. The land rent, estimated to be $20/ha/year \nfor YC16, is included as planter\u2019s equity.4 YC16 is a modest yield estimate for high-yielding \nplanting  stock  under  efficient  management,  which  LPA  is  expected  to  provide.  Perimeter \nprotection cost per ha, using poles and barbed wire, depends on the size of the plantation block. \nFor an isolated 1-ha plot, it would cost $218/ha but if SLPs are established in blocks of at least \n25 ha, the cost would drop to less than $44/ha. This model assumes the latter cost because \nblock plantations would provide further cost reductions and efficiencies in other operations as \nwell.5 LPA will adopt this model for SLPs. \n \n10.  By year-8, the total equity in the 1-ha plantation would be $883. Of this total, LPA\u2019s \nshare of equity would be $621 (70%) and the planter\u2019s equity would be $262 (30%). With YC16 \nand road-side log prices at $13.5/m3, the total revenue would amount to $1,728, providing an \nFIRR of 12%. However, it is proposed that LPA\u2019s share of revenue may be $862 (50%) and \nplanter\u2019s $865 (50%).6 In case YC16 is attained and assumed log price holds, LPA\u2019s share in \nthe revenue is based on the following principle: full recovery of all its investments ($621) plus an \nFIRR of 5.5% on its investment (2.5% to cover hard currency inflation +1.5% to cover risk \npremium +1.5% bonus for LPA employees).7 The balance revenue ($865) would be passed on \nto livelihood planters, providing an FIRR of 33% on their share of the equity. In case YC16 is not \nattained due a variety of reasons (soil type, insect or disease attack, fire, etc.), LPA will share \nthe loss with planters. Detailed conditions of the LPA\u2013planter contract are in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  For more details on the methodology of estimating land rents for plantations, see Supplementary Appendix A. \n5  More details of site selection and block plantation criteria are provided in Appendix 4. \n6  This principle of revenue-sharing is based on assumptions that YC16 and log price of $13.5/m3 are attained. \nConditions that would apply in case of loss or higher revenues are described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n7  LPA will conduct its business in Thai baht or $ to hedge against foreign exchange risk and inflation. Since all \ninputs, except labor, will be imported and the output exported, operations in hard currencies are justified and \nprudent.

The latter will be necessary where soils \nhave hard pans. The impending industrial plantation development is likely to introduce improved and cost effective \nmechanized land clearing/preparation technology that should be adopted by LPA for livelihood plantations. \nb  Delivered on site. It includes a margin of 10% for replacing initially planted seedlings that may be lost. \nc  When soil preparation is mechanized, hole digging is not required. \nd  Mechanized soil preparation may reduce year-1 weeding inputs by 30% compared with manual soil preparation. \ne  The protection costs are sensitive to block size; costs in this model are estimated for a block of 25 ha. \nf   LPA will partly compensate planter for labor inputs. Equal amount is deducted from planter's share of equity. \ng  LPA will recover its equity plus 5.5% IRR (2.5% for inflation + 1.5% for risk premium + 1.5% for bonus to its staff). \n \n11.  After the revenue is split, at the end of the first rotation (by year-8 for ha-1), the formal \ncontractual agreement between the planter and LPA, for that particular ha, will end. The same \nwould happen for ha-2 the following year and so on until trees in ha-5 are felled and revenues \nsplit. All revenues from the subsequent two rotations\u2014second rotation (years 16\u201320) and third \nrotation (years 24\u201328)\u2014will fully belong to the planter. The Government issues TLUCs on a \n3-year rolling basis. After the initial 3 years, according to the policy, if a holder is determined to \nhave put the land under intended and productive use, TLUCs can be turned into LUCs. This \noften does not occur because Government institutions do not have the capacity to survey and \ncertify  the  use  of  land.  LPA  will  establish  and  maintain  a  land  registry  and  facilitate  the \nimplementation of this policy to turn TLUCs into LUCs at the end of the first rotation, for \nparticipants who will have established their credentials as serious planters. Moreover, by that \ntime, planters will have gained adequate skills and knowledge to carry on plantation operations \non their own. LPA will establish a revolving fund with its share of revenues and go on to expand \nthe area of SLPs for another set of poor households elsewhere in the cluster. \n \n12.  Under this component, around 2,000 poor households will establish financially viable \nSLPs on about 9,500 ha in three clusters of about 3,000\u20133,500 ha each. LPA will provide them \nfull-package service through an equity-sharing model. Each household, on average, will be \nallocated 3\u20135 ha in blocks of 25\u201350 ha in the vicinity of their village. SLPs are projected to \nproduce about 1 million m3 of pulpwood, 35,000 m3 of sawlogs and 100,000 m3 of fuelwood \nduring the first 8-year rotation. Over the 8-year production cycle, it is estimated that about \n205 person-days/ha of labor input will be required (about 173 person-days during the first \n3 years and 32 person-days at harvesting). At this rate, SLPs will generate about 2 million \nperson-days of employment worth over $3 million during the first rotation. Therefore, the Project \nwill provide full and secure employment to the participating poor households. \n \nb.  Impact on Poverty \n13.  During preparation of the Project, household income surveys were carried out in 15 \nvillages of Vientiane Capital, and Bolikhamxay, Saravane, and Champasack provinces. The \nresults showed that about 60% of the households were classified as poor. The current food \npoverty line, estimated by the Government, is $123/capita/year or $738/household/year for a \nfamily of six. More than half the households sampled suffer shortages of rice and only 10% had \na small surplus for sale. The main source of livelihood is subsistence agriculture from growing \nrice and vegetables, raising livestock, seeking some off-farm employment, and collecting a few \nnon-timber forest products. The survey did not collect individual farmer\u2019s income or budget data, \nbut, from the aggregate data, it can be deduced that the average annual household cash \nincome is about $150 (Table A11.3). The cash payouts from LPA to the livelihood planter to \ncompensate for the labor inputs and revenue stream from the harvests of the first and second \nrotations are shown in Table A11.4. Currently, under- and unemployment in rural areas is as \nhigh as 50% or more. By participating in the SLP program with LPA, with 5 ha per household, \nthe average cash income from wages will amount to $259/year in year-1 and rise to over \n$300/year by year-5. By years 6 and 7, thinning of the earlier stands will start providing income ", "  Appendix 11  49 \nto planters. By year-8, the stand from the first 1-ha will be felled and it will generate $865 \nincome for the planter, and so on for the next 5 years. The second Eucalyptus rotation will be \ncoppiced. Therefore, the cost of establishing the second rotation will be only 30% of the first. \nThe  planter  will  keep  all  revenues  from  the  second  rotation.  In  the  intervening  periods \n(years 13\u201315 and 21\u201323), about 20\u201325% of good trees from the first and second rotations will \nbe left standing to turn them into sawlogs, which fetch 30\u201335% higher prices. In all, poor \nhouseholds  that  have  a  current  annual  income  of  $566  without  the  Project  (footnote  in \nTable A11.3) will increase their income to $858 with the Project, pulling them above the food \npoverty line ($738) in year-1. Within 8 years, the average household will have enough annual \ndisposable income ($942) over and above the paddy value of $416 to pay for adequate social \nservices such as education and primary healthcare. The multiplier effect on the economic well-\nbeing of individual households and the local economy will be significant, pulling them both out of \npoverty and turning them into middle-income groups. This equity-sharing model demonstrates \nthe financial viability of livelihood plantations and their potential role and impact on poverty \nreduction in Lao PDR. \n \nTable A11.3: Average Annual Household Cash Incomes, Without and With Project \n \n  Without Project  With Project \nSource of Income per Year  % Households  Approximate  Approximate Cash \nCash Value ($)  Value ($) \nRice (own consumption)a    100     \nRice sales    10    20    20 \nLivestock    90    65    65 \nNTFP    70    15   \nOff-Farm Employment    18    50   \nPlantation Employment    100      300 \nDuring First 8 Years        150    385 \nSmall Livelihood Plantations        858 \nAfter First 8-Year Rotation      150    942 \n NTFP = non-timber forest product. \n  a  Average landholding in the Project area is 1 ha per household of six people. Assuming an average yield of \n3 tonnes/ha, the value of paddy is about $416. The value of paddy along with cash income ($150) generates total \nhousehold income of $566, which is still $172 short of the food poverty line of $738 (footnote 14 in the main text). \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nc.  Land Rents \n14.  A simple methodology has been developed by assigning part of the overall enterprise \nreturn to each factor of production and allocating the residual value of return to land. For \ninstance, the four classical factors of production\u2014land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship\u2014\naptly apply to the plantation operations. Of these, the return to (or cost of) labor, capital, and \nentrepreneurship  are  fairly  well  known  based  on  the  current  operations  of  private  sector \ncompanies. In this model, the variable costs of production (including labor costs at $1.5/day and \nmanagement) have already been paid.8 Based on the 1-ha LIP model, a combination of FIRRs \nfor YC16, 20, and 24 m3/ha/year assuming log prices of $12/m3 and $13.5/m3 and land rents \nranging from $0\u2013$50/ha/year have been estimated (Table A11.5). For LIP operations, YC20 is \nconsidered a bare minimum and it is also fair to assume a log price of $13.5/m3 for such \noperations. As the results show, after paying land rent of $30/ha/year, LIPs would be able to \ngenerate an FIRR of 12%. If the cost of capital is assumed to be around 7%, it leaves the \ncompany with a 5% return for its entrepreneurship. It is likely that LIPs, within a few years of \noperations, will be able to calibrate their production models and attain much higher yield classes \nas well as FIRRs. With YC24, FIRR for the same level of rent ($30/ha/year) would be 15% and \n                                                 \n8 The management cost for a large plantation operation (>5,000 ha) is estimated to be $30/ha/year. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \n14% for rent of even $50/ha/year. The analysis shows that plantations with higher YCs are not \ntoo sensitive to higher land rents. \n \nTable A11.4: Cash Income of Livelihood Planters with the Project \n \nArea Planted (ha)  Income \nYear \n1  2  3  4  5  ($) \n1  2006    259            259 \n2  2007    37    259          296 \n3  2008    17    37    259        313 \n4  2009      17    37    259      313 \n5  2010        17    37    259    313 \n6  2011          17    37    54 \n7  2012            17    17 \n8  2013    865            865 \n9  2014      865          865 \n10  2015        865        865 \n11  2016          865      865 \n12  2017            865    865 \n13  2018              0 \n14  2019              0 \n15  2020              0 \n16  2021   1,514            1,514 \n17  2022     1,514          1,514 \n18  2023        1,514        1,514 \n19  2024          1,514      1,514 \n20  2025                1,514    1,514 \nNote: Planters would keep about 25% healthier trees from rotation 1 (years 8\u201312) and rotation 2 (years 16\u201320) \nstands for sawlogs, which fetch 30\u201335% higher price.

Financial Viability of Lao Plantation Authority \n15.  The core operations of LPA\u2014financing SLPs and MEPs\u2014will be financially viable. LPA \nwill charge about $30/ha/year for its services to SLPs and provide all the material at cost. ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nDevelopment of LIPs, facilitated by LPA, will generate significant revenues in land rents, and \ncorporate and other taxes. It is estimated that land rents could be $20\u201350/ha/year depending on \nthe soil conditions and locations of LIPs. Based on the current level of interest by the private \nsector, it is envisaged that development of LIPs in the next 5\u201310 years will be rapid. However, \neven based on a modest estimate, by 2015 over 150,000 ha may be under LIPs. Assuming an \naverage land rent of $20/ha/year, LIPs would be generating about $3 million/year by 2015 in \nland rents alone. At full development by 2020, the LIP area will be >325,000 ha and they will be \nharvesting about 25,000 ha/year, generating an estimated land rent of $6.5 million and tax \nrevenue of another $5 million a year (at 20% current corporate income tax). \n \n16.  Part of LPA income will be a portion of the land prospecting license fees and land rents \ncollected  from  LIPs.  LPA\u2019s  land-use  planning  would  add  value  to  the  land,  which  would \notherwise be left unproductive. Therefore, it is justified that part of the rental revenues\u2014as land \nmanagement fee\u2014should be used to finance continuing work on land-use planning, attracting \nand facilitating the entry of private companies in this subsector, and assisting the Government in \nregulating their operations for sustainable plantation management. Additional income would \naccrue to LPA from a service charge on procurement of materials (fertilizers, insecticides, \nfencing materials, etc.) where it could take advantage of bulk purchase arrangements to obtain \ndiscounts. Most of the benefits of the discount could be passed on to planters, but a small \nproportion (about 2%) could be retained by LPA. Similarly, with the harvesting and marketing of \nplantation logs, LPA could negotiate a better price than that offered to individual planters by the \nmiddlemen and traders, and therefore retain a small margin (about 2%) as a service charge. \n \n17.  Table A11.6 gives a cash flow forecast for what is considered to be an attainable \nscenario. The first year is start up with no revenue but it entails less than full costs. It will take \nabout 2 years to recruit all the staff and set up offices. For the 6-year Project period, LPA will be \nfully financed by project funds. It will require stop-gap cash flow for years 7 and 8, which can be \nmet  by  receipts  from  land  management  fee.  From  year-9,  it  will  start  generating  its  own \nrevenues when the first SLP lot is felled. The analysis shows that, under the assumptions made, \nLPA will be financially self-sufficient with adequate working capital to continue expanding SLP \narea from year-10 and beyond. \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n18.  The bulk (85%) of the Project investment will be made in SLPs and only modest (3%) in \nMEPs and SMEs; no direct investments will be made in LIPs. There will be quantifiable benefits \nfrom MEPs and SMEs but they are not included in the economic analysis. Similarly, the return to \nsociety  from  LIP  operations\u2014resulting  from  employment  and  revenue  generation\u2014will  be \nsignificant but they are also excluded from this analysis. The economic analysis, therefore, was \ncarried out including all LPA costs but the benefits only from SLPs. \n \na.  Evaluation Methodology and Assumptions \n19.  The economic analysis has been carried out for a project life of 30 years. Constant 2005 \nprices were used in US dollars at the current exchange rate. Economic costs and benefits are \nestimated using the world price numeraire. The prices of non-traded goods have been adjusted \nby using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. This is equivalent to using a shadow exchange \nrate factor of 1.1, which has been used in the preparation of other recent Asian Development \nBank projects in Lao PDR, and is appropriate as it approximately reflects the average level of \nduties  and  taxes.  A  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.8  has  been  used  to  reflect  the  under-  and \nunemployment  rate  in  rural  areas.  For  tractors  and  machinery,  used  in  mechanized  land \npreparation and other operations, taxes and duties account for about 35% of the domestic price. \nFor these activities, a conversion factor of 0.65 has been used. The prices of seedlings and \nother domestically produced materials have not been adjusted. \n ", " \nTable A11.6: Income, Expenditures, Revenues, and Cash Flow Projections for Lao Plantation

The principal output of the Project will be plantation logs. The log prices are set by the \ninternational market (mostly Thai for now) and there are no taxes or duties on the export of \nplantation logs. Therefore, the economic prices are the same as the financial prices. The \nboarder price was adjusted for transportation cost with reference to Khon Kaen in northeast \nThailand.1 Transportation costs for logs are adjusted by the standard conversion factor to reflect \ndifferences between international and domestic fuel prices. \n \nb.  Economic Viability \n21.  The estimated project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15% (Table A11.7). This \nis based on the benefits from three rotations of SLPs established on 9,500 ha. The first rotation \nwill be established with full cost but the second rotation starting in year-9 will be coppiced. The \nthird rotation, starting in year-17, will be replanted but its establishment cost will be less than \nthat of the first rotation due to savings in fencing costs. The EIRR is fairly robust. The effects of \nchanges in key factors have been tested in sensitivity analysis. The impact of 20% increase in \nwage rate or 20% decrease in log price drops the EIRR to 14% and 13%, respectively. The \nlimited impact of changes in these variables on EIRR shows that the project outcome would be \nrobust in response to moderate changes in these factors. However, the most significant impact \non  EIRR  is  by  the  YC;  if  it  drops  below  YC12,  SLPs  would  not  be  economically  viable. \nTherefore, LPA would ensure that SLPs are established on suitable lands, adequate training is \nimparted, and appropriate materials are provided to planters to attain YC16 or better. \n \n                                                 \n1  Phoenix Pulp and Paper Company, Ltd, in Khon Kaen, is located 180 km from the Friendship Bridge boarder point \nnear Vientiane.

Distribution Analysis \n22.  Distribution analysis was also carried out to attribute the outcome of project benefits to \nfour main stakeholders: (i) poor households managing SLPs, (ii) entrepreneurs establishing \nMEPs, (iii) the Government, and (iv) the LPA. The results are summarized in Table A11.8. The \nproject outcome will be most beneficial to the poor under the SLP program; by sharing about \n27%  of  the  cost,  they  will  receive  54%  of  the  benefits.  Similarly,  entrepreneurs  and  the \nGovernment will also draw a higher share of benefits compared with their share in the cost. \nLPA, on the other hand, will share 59% of the cost but draw only 27% of the benefits. Almost all \nof its benefits will be transferred to poor households under the SLP program. Despite such a \nsignificant resource transfer, LPA will still be a financially viable organization in the long run. \nThrough  its  share  of  revenues,  it  will  fully  recover  its  equity,  cost  of  management  and \noperations, bonus for its employees, and a surcharge for inflation. \n \nd.  Non-Quantified Economic Benefits \n23.  LPA will strengthen the institutional and staff capacity of the Government to develop the \nplantations subsector. Although capacity building will generate significant benefits in the short \nand long term, direct benefits of these activities cannot be quantified. Similarly, the benefits of \nintegrated  land-use  planning,  allocation,  and  negotiating  land  lease  agreements  will  help \nsignificantly  lower  the  transaction  costs  for  all  types  of  planters,  especially  multinational \ncompanies interested in FDI, but the intended benefits are hard to estimate. Therefore, the \nproject benefit stream does not include any estimate of such benefits. The approximate cost of \ninstitutional development and capacity building would amount to about 35% of the total project \ncost. Although benefits of capacity building cannot be quantified, these activities are critical to \nhelp realize the benefits of investment activities. For instance, LPA\u2019s Livelihood Plantation \nDivision and Industrial Plantation Division cannot proceed with their operations without inputs \nfrom the Land Survey Division\u2019s land-use planning and analysis. Similarly, full-package and \none-window services to SLPs, MEPs, SMEs, and LIPs depend on LPA\u2019s overall capacity to \ndeliver and coordinate a range of activities efficiently. This interdependence of all LPA activities \nis critical to the realization of overall project benefits. Therefore, institutional development and \ncapacity building in the Government, by establishing LPA, is a prerequisite to successfully \nimplement these activities and develop the subsector. \n \n24.  The Project will generate significant employment and other economic benefits in down- \nand upstream activities, i.e., marketing, trade, and processing. Even if half the expressions of \ninterest from the multinational companies materialize, the pace of subsector development would \nbe significant. Conservative estimates show that as much as 150,000 ha may be under LIPs by \n2015.  This  scale  of  development  would  create  significant  employment  opportunities\u2014even \n5,000 ha/year plantation development will create 500,000 person-days of employment. This \nsituation would result in labor shortages, requiring increasingly mechanized means of plantation \nmanagement. This also implies higher wage rates, jobs with higher skills, more income for the \nhouseholds, and a significant multiplier effect on regional and national economies. Similarly, the \nGovernment would invest the considerable revenues raised from LIPs and industrial processing \noperations  in  social  development,  generating  further  benefits  for  society  in  general.  Rural \nhouseholds, not participating in the Project directly, will benefit from the additional demand for \nlabor in their areas from MEPs and LIPs. Many of these will be poor households. There will also \nbe a multiplier effect on the local economy of those villages and districts where cash would be \ninjected through employment, creating new business and trade opportunities. \n \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.8: Distribution Analysis Using Discount Rate of 12% \n($, constant 2005) \n \nEntrepreneur \nPlanter (SLP)  LPA  Government  Total \nFactors  (MEP) \n($)  (%)  ($)  (%)  ($)  (%)  ($)  (%)  ($) \nAdministration    0.00    0.00  1,922,936 76.00  607,243  24.00  2,530,178\nLabor  2,279,417  53.33  270,509 6.33  1,724,393 40.34    0.00  4,274,318\nCost \nMaterials     0.00  255,402 15.65  1,376,667 84.35     0.00  1,632,069\nTotal  2,279,417  27.02  525,911 6.23  5,023,995 59.55  607,243  7.20  8,436,565\n  Benefit  5,134,945  54.33  792,384 8.38  2,579,186 27.29  945,168  10.00  9,451,684\n  NPV  5,134,945  65.67  536,982 6.87  1,202,519 15.38  945,168  12.09  7,819,615\nBenefit/Cost Ratio  2.3     1.5     0.5     1.6     1.1 \nLPA = Lao Plantation Authority, MEP = medium enterprise plantation, NPV = net present value, SLP = small \nlivelihood plantation. \nNotes:         \n1.

Rodrik has developed a framework of industrial policy.2 Although the development of the \nproject concept and the LPA model predate this paper, it is instructive to evaluate the economic \njustification  of  setting  up  LPA  against  his  \u201c10  design  principles  of  industrial  policy\u201d \n(Supplementary Appendix A). Rodrik suggests that \u201cdeveloping societies need to embed private \ninitiatives in a framework of public action that encourages restructuring, diversification, and \ntechnological dynamism beyond what market forces on their own would generate\u201d. He also \nargues \u201cthat getting the institutional setting right, with an adequate balance between autonomy \nand embeddedness on the part of Government officials, is far more important than worrying \nabout the precise policy instruments to be deployed\u201d. The rationale of setting up LPA and its \neconomic justification rest on fundamental principles such as these. \n \nD.  Conclusions \n \n26.  The analysis shows that the Project is financially and economically viable and robust. All \ntypes and sizes of plantations\u2014SLPs, MEPs, and LIPs\u2014will be financially viable. With the \nfinancing  mechanism  of  equity-sharing,  LPA  can  recover  adequate  revenues  to  cover  its \ninvestment and operational costs while providing effective support to its clients and offering \nperformance-based incentives for its employees. With and without Project incomes and poverty \nimpact  ratios  assure  that  the  Project  will  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  on \nparticipating poor households. LPA will generate adequate revenues to upscale its support for \nSLPs beyond the Project life. The economic analysis shows that the Project investment in SLPs \nwill be viable and robust, and that the Project has the potential to generate much greater social \nbenefits than the value of resource committed for its activities. The support for LPA is justified \nas it has enormous potential to efficiently develop the forest plantations subsector. Proximity to \nmarkets, quality of plantation lands, and LPA\u2019s semiautonomous management are possible risks \nthat will require close monitoring to achieve envisaged project benefits. \n                                                 \n2  Rodrik, Dani. 2004.

The Resettlement Framework (RF) and the Ethnic Minority \nDevelopment Framework (EMDF) have been prepared to identify and compensate all affected \nhouseholds, including ethnic minority communities, that may be affected by the development of \nlarge  industrial  plantations  (LIPs)  and  medium-sized  enterprise  plantations  (MEPs).  Both \nframeworks  have  been  developed  in  accordance  with  various  laws  and  guidelines  of  the \nGovernment,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement1  and  policy  on  indigenous  people.2 \nThese frameworks also build upon principles being developed under other Asian Development \nBank (ADB)-funded projects in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The RF and \nEMDF will be translated into Lao and distributed to central and local agencies, companies, and \nindividuals responsible for developing LIPs and MEPs. These frameworks should also be read \nin conjunction with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998) and \nvarious relevant Government laws and guidelines. \n \n2.  During project preparation, detailed social and poverty assessments found it necessary \nto prepare the RF and EMDF to safeguard the vulnerable groups against any negative impacts \nof plantation development. As exact sites for LIPs and MEPs will be identified later\u2014after the \nLao Plantation Authority (LPA) undertakes land-use planning\u2014these frameworks will provide \nfundamental principles upon which detailed resettlement and ethnic minority development plans \nwill be prepared to determine entitlements for the affected persons (APs). These plans will \nensure that (i) rights of all APs are protected during resettlement activities, (ii) ethnic minorities \nare not disadvantaged by virtue of their social and cultural characteristics, and (iii) all APs have \nequal access to project benefits. To ensure that ethnic minority households and villages benefit \nto the same degree as the predominantly Lao Loum villages, a community development plan for \nthese villages will be prepared following the EMDF\u2019s principles. All permanent and temporary \nimpacts of project activities will be fully addressed. \n \n3.  Government Policies and Laws. This Project will be bound by the principles and \nconditions stated in the RF, and the same will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees in \nforce in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists. In the Lao PDR, compensation principles and \npolicy  framework  for  land  acquisition  are  governed  by  several  statutory  laws:  Constitution \n(1991),  Forestry  Law  (1996),  Land  Law  (1997),  and  Road  Law  (1999).  Decree  192  on \nResettlement and Compensation (July 2005) fully meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement. Under the Land Law (Articles 17\u201318 and 21\u201322), land titles, which \nprovide provisional ownership rights to use agricultural as well as forestland, can be issued. All \nAPs\u2014whether they have land titles or temporary land-use certificates, or are unregistered\u2014will \nbe entitled to compensation for losses caused by the Project.3  \n \n4.  Implementation, Monitoring, and Reporting. LPA will be responsible for implementing \nthe RF and EMDF and for preparing requisite plans. These plans will be prepared in accordance \nwith Government policies, laws, and decrees, and ADB policies. LPA will also be responsible for \nimplementing these plans, regularly monitoring them, and reporting to the Government and \nADB. The preparation and implementation of these plans will be externally monitored during the \nProject\u2019s midterm review. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n3  People without any proof of ownership and/or land-use certificates are considered \u201cunregistered\u201d users. The Land \nLaw, however, provides mechanisms (e.g., residency or use of land by unregistered users for at least 2 years) by \nwhich individuals can apply for certification. While the Land Law ensures compensation for legal owners and users \nof the land, it does not guarantee either replacement value of land or restoration of income, or provide for \ncompensation to nonlegal (but not illegal) users. This is now guaranteed by Decree 192. \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nPROJECT RISKS \n1.  The Project, its operations, and beneficiaries will face a variety of political, institutional, \nmarket, business, financial, and environmental risks. These risks can be effectively mitigated. \nThe risks and their mitigating measures are described below. \n \nA.  Political Risk \n2.  Setting up Lao Plantation Authority (LPA) is an unprecedented and unique experiment in \nLao PDR. It is a high-risk but high-gain proposition. LPA\u2019s operations will be prone to political \nrisks if its autonomy, staffing, and functions are compromised by interference from Government \nofficials.  On  the  other  hand,  international  investors  perceive  political  risk  because  of  the \nrelatively short time that Lao PDR has been open to foreign investment. The Law on Promotion \nand Management of Foreign Investment, 1994 protects foreign investors against appropriation \nof their assets and there is no reason to believe that the Government would not comply with its \nown law. However, in view of the unforeseen changes that have taken place in other countries, \nthis is still perceived as a distinct risk. \n \n3.  Mitigation. LPA\u2019s autonomy will be enshrined in its prime ministerial decree\u2014a sign of \nthe  highest-level  Government  commitment.  The  LPA  experiment  is  a  calculated  risk.  The \nGovernment has provided specific assurances to allow LPA to undertake its operations without \ninterference. Specific triggers have been covenanted in the draft Loan Agreement to suspend \nand/or  cancel  LPA  financing  if  operations  deviate  from  its  approved  work  plan.  Its  key \nmanagement staff will have a proven professional track record and provided adequate full-time \ninputs. Moreover, other stakeholders\u2014including nongovernment members of Board of Directors \n(BOD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Government of Malaysia\u2014will provide close \nand regular supervision and monitoring of its operations, especially in the first 2\u20133 formative \nyears. For the political risk of the other kind, Lanxang Oxiana Mines Company and Nam Thuen \n2 Power Company provide two of several other good examples where foreign investors have \nconsidered  Lao  PDR  a  secure  investment  environment.  ADB  may  provide  a  political  risk \nguarantee (PRG) facility to qualified foreign investors in the plantations subsector. The PRG \nfacility procedures and conditions are described in Appendix 5. Besides, establishment of LPA \nin itself would exude confidence among the potential foreign investors. \n \nB.  Institutional Risk \n4.  Most of the investment capital required to establish large industrial plantations (LIPs) and \nassociated processing plants will be raised in the international markets. Therefore, foreign \ninvestors and their bankers will be concerned with the institutional risks of having to deal with \nmany  different  Government  agencies.  Weak  institutional  and  staff  capacity  of  Government \nagencies also adds to their transaction costs. Currently, foreign investors face a number of \ninstitutional difficulties in obtaining approvals for investing in plantations. These mainly relate to \nidentifying and leasing suitable land and obtaining a series of licenses and permits. All lands are \nstate property in Lao PDR. But the law recognizes traditional and occupational rights of farmers \nand communities. Therefore, obtaining land for plantations involves substantial negotiations with \nlocal authorities and communities to identify land that does not have claims for other economic \nuses. This is a time-consuming and costly process and has almost certainly been a factor in \ndelaying a number of potential investments. \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \n5.  Mitigation. The Department of Domestic and Foreign Investment (DDFI) is empowered \nto provide a one-stop service to foreign investors in all sectors. This is an important contribution \nto mitigating the institutional risks but it does not cover the identification and negotiation of \nsuitable land for plantations. For most foreign investments, in other sectors, only limited areas of \nland  are  required  for  buildings  or  factories.  But  plantations  require  extensive  areas  and, \ntherefore,  need  special  consideration.  LPA,  with  requisite  capacity,  and  remit  to  identify, \nnegotiate, and lease suitable lands for plantations, will mitigate this risk and reduce transaction \ncosts for investors. LPA and DDFI would be able to jointly provide the one-stop service to \npotential investors in this subsector. \n \nC.  Market Risk \n6.  Market risk is minimal as a number of multinational pulp and paper companies are now \nkeen to invest in this subsector. Another clear sign that the plantation log markets are coming of \nage is seen along the Route 13 South where a number of procurement depots have sprung up \nin recent months by intermediaries of Thai pulp and paper companies. Although this is still a \nnascent market and information on spot prices, transport costs, and technical parameters (log \nsize and moisture content) is still not widely available to most planters, it is well on its way to \nsound development. \n \n7.  Mitigation. LPA design provides for specific assistance to planters to mitigate market \nrisk, starting with those of the Industrial Tree Plantation Project (ITPP)1 planters. Through a \nnumber of initiatives and actions, LPA would ensure that planters get fair prices for their logs. \nOne or two wholesale log markets will be established (one near Friendship Bridge in Vientiane \nCapital and another along Route 13 South) to help clear the market through transparent price \nand transaction mechanisms. Information on daily prices, along with technical parameters in \nthese  wholesale  markets,  will  help  planters  determine  the  stumpage  price  by  discounting \nharvesting  and  transport  costs\u2014thus  minimizing  the  risk  of  being  duped  by  unscrupulous \nintermediaries. Such market risks mainly apply to individual planters. LIP investors normally \nfactor in market risks to their investment decisions. The fact that multinational companies are \ngearing up to establish LIPs would also help mitigate the market risk, as the commitment of \nlarge amounts of private capital will more or less guarantee markets for plantation log in the \nfuture. Individual planters also stand to gain from such developments, especially those in the \nproximity of LIPs. In its cluster areas and where ITPP plantations currently stand, LPA will \nprovide marketing services. \n \nD.  Business Risk \n8.  There are business (technical) risks that will apply to all types of plantations, i.e., quality \nof planting stock, technical know-how, fire, disease, and adverse whether conditions (drought). \nBut experienced plantation managers normally adopt measures to minimize these risks and the \ncost is factored into their business plans. SLPs and MEPs will benefit from the transfer of \ntechnology from both LPA and LIPs in order to mitigate these risks. \n \nE.  Financial Risk \n9.  In  international  finance  circles,  Lao  PDR  is  perceived  as  a  high-risk  country  for \ninvestment. This increases the cost of borrowing for investors and may also deter some from \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Industrial Tree Plantation Project. \nManila. (Loan 1295\u2013LAO).  \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \ncontemplating investments in the country. In addition to these perceived financial risks, the \ntransaction costs of working in Lao PDR are considered too high because of delays in obtaining \napprovals and permits, and due to inconsistencies between national laws and regulations and \nthe way they are interpreted in the provinces. On the other hand, there are potential financial \nrisks for the Government if some of the investors turn out to be unscrupulous or irresponsible. \nThe establishment of LPA would also pose some financial risk for the Government if it costs as \nmuch to set up and does not deliver expected outputs. \n \n10.  Mitigation. There are three ways these risks can be mitigated. First, LPA will be able to \ninvestigate the transaction costs and have the authority to deal with them by establishing \ncommon  and  transparent  arrangements  throughout  the  country.  Second,  ADB,  through  its \nprivate sector operations, may provide cofinancing to qualified foreign investors\u2014spreading and \nmitigating  some  financial  risk.  Third,  financial  risks  to  the  Government  from  potential \nunscrupulous  investors  will  be  mitigated  by  LPA\u2019s  ability  to  undertake  due  diligence \ninvestigations of potential investors before approval. \n \nF.  Environmental Risk \n11.  A recent comprehensive study on the subject concludes:  \n \u201cFast-wood forestry is neither inherently good nor inherently bad. It is neutral technology \nwhich, when poorly planned and executed, can cause grave problems; and which, when \nwell planned and executed, can deliver not just large quantities of wood, but a range of \nenvironmental and social benefits.\u201d2  \nHistory is replete with examples where exotic species of crops and trees have been highly \nsuccessfully adopted in new environments. Adoption of oil palm and rubber trees in Malaysia \nfrom Brazil in the early 1800s is a prime example in the region. Ironically, both these trees are \nnow more successfully cultivated in this region than in their native Brazil (where they are \nenduring a variety of diseases and pest attacks). Conversely, the productivity of Eucalyptus is \nmuch higher in its adopted environments in Latin America (Chile and Brazil) and South Africa \nthan its native Australia. Its productivity was around yield class (YC) 20 in the 1970s when first \nintroduced in Brazil, but it now regularly exceeds YC40. Nevertheless, there are bad examples \nof its adoption in many places (the Congo). Despite all its failings, one of the major contributions \nof ITPP is that it has successfully demonstrated that, if Eucalyptus plantations are established \nand managed effectively, they can be environmentally safe and financially viable. \n \n12.  Mitigation. All types of plantations will comprise only a small portion of the mosaic of \nland-use systems in any given location. Even LIPs will not be wall-to-wall plantations, spanning \nhundreds of thousands of hectares (ha) in just one locality. Rather, LIPs will be established in \nblocks of 200\u2013300 ha with buffer zones comprising other land uses, separating them from \nnatural forests. Similarly, they would keep a safe distance from streams and other water bodies \nand will not be grown on slopes >20\u00b0. A comprehensive set of environmental and technical \nstandards and criteria have been prepared as part of LPA\u2019s compliance function. Its plantation \nstandards and compliance officer will be responsible for establishing codes of practice and \nmonitoring compliance. Regular third party environmental audits will be carried out to monitor \ncompliance. \n \n                                                 \n2  Cossalter, C. and C. Pye-Smith. 2003.
