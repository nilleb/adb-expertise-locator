I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nincrease in the amount available for the Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program \n(RFSDCP) in Nepal,1 (ii) a proposed loan to Nepal for subprogram 2 of the RFSDCP, and (iii) a \nproposed grant to Nepal for the Second Rural Finance Sector Development Project. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to Nepal for Capacity Building for Rural \nFinance Sector Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. In this report, RFSDCP \ndenotes the cluster program comprising subprograms 1 and 2. Subprogram 1 refers to the \nsubprogram implemented in 2006\u20132009. Subprogram 2, to be implemented in 2010\u20132012, will \nconsist of the loan and the grant project described in this report. The design, implementation \nmodality, and other aspects covered in this report refer to subprogram 2, unless specified \notherwise.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT CLUSTER PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale  \n2.  Nepal is in reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction after its decade-long conflict. \nAs peace has set in, the macroeconomic environment has also turned positive and, in 2008, the \ngross domestic product grew by 4.7%. Nepal has also substantially reduced the incidence of \npoverty, from 42% in 1996 to 31% in 2004. But severe poverty persists in various parts of the \ncountry and economic growth is uneven. Poverty in Nepal is largely a rural phenomenon and \nrural poverty is closely associated with limited access to social and economic infrastructure such \nas roads, energy, markets, and finance.  \n \n3.  Despite the recent rapid growth of the financial sector, just 30% of Nepalese households \nhave an account with or a loan from formal or semiformal financial institutions,2 and 70% have \nno access to institutional finance but rely only on informal sources3 of finance or are financially \nexcluded.  The  percentage  of  financially  excluded  households  are  higher  in  the  hills  and \nmountain areas (80% of the households) and among the poorest households (75%). Exclusive \nreliance on informal lending is more common in the Western region (77%). Unequal access to \nformal financial services is a critical economic constraint, especially given the relatively higher \ninterest rates charged in the informal sector.4  \n \n4.  The  limited  access  to  finance  in  Nepal  is  largely  due  to  (i) excessive  government \ninvolvement and distortional policies, (ii) poor governance and the limited outreach of public \nrural finance institutions (RFIs),5 (iii) the limited scale and capacity of semiformal RFIs, (iv) the \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Sector \nDevelopment Program Cluster of Loans, Asian Development Fund Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to Nepal \nfor the Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program. Manila.  \n2  Formal financial institutions are licensed and regulated by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank. \nSemiformal institutions are registered under various acts, such as the Cooperative Act (1992) and the Societies \nRegistration Act (1977) but are not licensed or regulated by NRB.  \n3  Main sources of informal lending are families, relatives, friends, and moneylenders. \n4  Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and \nInternational Labor Organization. 2009. Country Diagnostic Studies\u2014Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. \n5  Rural finance is defined as financial intermediation in the rural sector and is a subset of the broader finance sector. \nThis report defines RFIs as financial intermediaries, formal and semiformal, that serve the rural areas. Even \ncommercial banks with head offices in the urban areas are considered RFIs if they serve rural clients. Microfinance \ninstitutions are financial intermediaries that mainly provide non-collateral loans below NRs150,000. Because of the \nhigh concentration of the poor and low-income households in the rural areas, most microfinance institutions \noperate in the rural areas and are categorized as RFIs. This report, however, refers to microfinance institutions to \ndistinguish financial intermediation for small borrowers from other forms of lending. \n ", "2   \nlack of appropriate laws and regulations for the supervision of RFIs, (v) insufficient support \ninfrastructure for rural finance, and (vi) the inaccessibility of the hills and mountain areas.  \n \n5.  At the core of the problems in the rural finance sector in Nepal is the omnipresence of \nthe  government  in  RFI  ownership  and  management.  Public  institutions  dominate  the  rural \nfinance sector, and the outreach of the three key public RFIs\u2014the Agricultural Development \nBank Limited (ADBL), the Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB), and the Grameen Bikash \nBanks (GBBs)\u2014is estimated to account for more than 60% of the total outreach of formal and \nsemiformal  rural  finance.  Despite  their  extensive  rural  network,  however,  these  public \ninstitutions have not made the most of their outreach potential because of weak governance and \nmanagement,  limited  staff  skills,  and  scant  attention  to  profitability  and  sustainability.  To \nimprove access to finance the government has (i) directed banks to set aside 3% of their total \nloan portfolio for low-income households and small businesses (the so-called \u201cdeprived sector \nlending  scheme\u201d),  and  (ii) created  special  microfinance  windows  and  programs.  But  most \ngovernment-sponsored  microfinance  programs  have  performed  poorly  and  have  limited \noutreach.  The  government\u2019s  \"deprived  sector  lending  scheme\"  has  also  weakened  market \nincentives  by  discouraging  microfinance  institutions  from  expanding  their  outreach  through \nefficiency improvements and innovation.  \n \n6.  Semiformal  RFIs  such  as  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and \nsavings and credit cooperatives are expected to fill the gap. But semiformal RFIs also suffer \nfrom weak capacity, limited scale of operations, and insufficient skills to be viable and provide \noutreach.  Most  lack  suitable  accounting,  reporting,  and  management  information  systems \n(MISs). In the absence of regulatory requirements for accountability and transparency, RFIs \nhave not been able to improve their accounting and internal controls and boost their operating \ncapacity. There are no regulations specific to semiformal RFIs. Formal RFIs, licensed and \nregulated by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, make up only a small portion of \nrural  finance  intermediaries  in  number.  An  estimated  2,300  cooperatives  and  15,000 \nmicrofinance NGOs provide financial intermediation and take deposits without license. The poor \nsupervision of these institutions does not bode well for the security of depositors and the \nstability of the rural finance sector.  \n \n7.  The  rural  finance  sector  needs  support  infrastructure  such  as  a  Credit  Information \nBureau (CIB) and a Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) to grow. The CIB that was created in 2005 \nserves mainly commercial banks. The service must be extended to more RFIs to improve their \nrisk mitigation and the governance of the rural finance sector. A three-member DRT was formed \nto make debt recovery decisions for financial institutions, but its low capacity has delayed loan \nrecovery. This burden on RFIs lowers the credibility of the rural finance sector.   \n \n8.  The topography of the hills and mountains hampers the organization of group members \nand raises the transaction cost of microcredit beyond the cost in the terai (plain areas). Savings \nand credit cooperatives, managed by their own members, are considered more suitable for the \nhills and mountains. But they are hard put to mobilize resources, expand credit, and improve the \nefficiency of microfinance operations. The Grameen-type group-based microcredit model,6 while \neffective  in  the  terai  region,  is  difficult  to  implement  in  the  hills  and  mountains,  where \nhouseholds are sparsely located, and roads and communication networks are scarce. More \nappropriate approaches need to be developed for those areas through pilot initiatives.  \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Rural Finance Sector Development \nCluster Program and its subprogram 1 on 26 October 2006 to develop an enabling environment \nfor  the  rural  finance  sector  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms. \n                                                 \n6  In the Grameen microcredit model, started by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, women form themselves into \ngroups of 5\u201320 members each and borrow on the basis of a group guarantee.  \n   ", "  3\nSubprogram 1,  which  was  completed  in  December  2009,  achieved  successful  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms.7 According to the progress report for the release of the second tranche of \nthe loan for subprogram 1, 14 of 19 conditions were fully complied with, one was substantially \ncomplied with, and four were partially complied with.8  The partial compliance was due to the \ndelay  in  the  passage  of  supporting  laws  and  regulations,  and  in  product  and  process \ninnovations,  caused  mainly  by  the  low  implementation  capacity  of  NRB,  the  implementing \nagency for  the component. Qualified consultants were subsequently fielded to assist NRB \nduring subprogram 1. Currently, of the four partially complied conditions, two are fully complied \nwith. The condition relating to pilot-testing a crop insurance program for small and marginal \nfarmers has been removed from subprogram 2. This made little progress under subprogram 1 \nbecause of the technical complexity of the scheme and the lack of institutions that could capably \npilot-test it. The removal of the component will not affect the expected outcome of the cluster \nprogram. The remaining condition relating to approval of draft Microfinance Act has been carried \nto subprogram 2. The two tranches of the loan for subprogram 1, totaling $56 million, were fully \ndisbursed.  \n \n10.  Subprogram 2, the second phase of RFSDCP, will complete the rural finance sector \nreform agenda. It is consistent with the strategic focus of the country partnership strategy for \nNepal (2010\u20132012) on making financial services more accessible to the poor and the rural \nareas.9  The  RFSDCP  supports  the  government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform  Program  in \ncoordination with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.10  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the RFSDCP will be economic growth and poverty reduction in rural areas \nthrough improved rural financial intermediation and easier access to affordable rural finance \nservices, with special attention to marginalized groups and women.11 The outcome will be an \ninclusive rural finance system that is more sound and efficient, and has wider outreach. As the last \nsubprogram of RFSDCP, subprogram 2 will develop a sound rural finance sector environment that \nis conducive to the expansion of rural finance outreach. The policy and institutional reform actions \nunder subprogram 2 will (i) transform key RFIs into viable rural finance intermediaries with a \nstrong client orientation and pro-poor focus, and (ii) improve the efficiency and widen the outreach \nof semiformal RFIs.12 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n12.  Subprogram  2 will continue the policy and institutional reform actions begun under \nsubprogram 1.13 \n \n                                                 \n7  The impact of ADB\u2019s assistance through subprogram 1, according to the country assistance program evaluation for \nNepal (2009), is \u201clikely [to be] substantial. RFSDCP helped reinstate ADBL as a strong financial institution focused \non agricultural and rural development, [and] improved [the] delivery mechanism for rural finance. The institutional \ndevelopment of the major rural finance institutions is expected to result in a credit environment with improved \nsupervision and regulation. The institutions are moving [toward] eventual privatization.\u201d ADB. 2009. Country \nAssistance Program Evaluation: Nepal\u2014Delivering Assistance in a Challenging Environment.

Supportive legal and regulatory framework. The process of establishing a legislative \nact and a regulatory authority\u2014the second-tier institution (STI)\u2014to supervise RFIs, which was \nset  in  motion  under  subprogram  1,  will  continue.  Key  component  outputs  will  be  (i) the \ndevelopment of a legal framework for RFI supervision and regulation, the Micro Finance Act; \n(ii) the establishment of the STI; and (iii) information dissemination and the start of RFI licensing \nand regulation. The Government will also review and update its Micro Finance Policy (2008). \nThe STI is envisaged to be an autonomous regulatory body governed by a board of directors \nrepresenting the government, NRB, and the private sector. For this initiative, the grant project \nwill  finance  consultant  experts  at  NRB  to  (i) draft  regulations,  operating  manuals,  and \nprocedures for the STI; (ii) set up and start operating the STI; and (iii) disseminate information to \nRFIs and train them. An MIS will also be developed for the STI as part of the grant project. \n \n14.  Institutional restructuring and reforms:\u00a0Agricultural Development Bank Limited. \nTransforming ADBL, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, into a viable and effective financial \nintermediary  is  a  key  objective  of  RFSDCP.  The  ADBL  restructuring  under  subprogram  1 \ninvolved voluntary retirement, the divestment of 15% of the government\u2019s shareholding in ADBL \nto small shareholders,14 and the launch of the initial public offering, along with organizational \nand operational restructuring. An international consultant who served as chief technical adviser \nand national consultants assisted in the restructuring.  \n \n15.  Key outputs of subprogram 2 will be the implementation of (i) the capital restructuring of \nADBL, and (ii) the second phase of the ADBL institutional restructuring. A private strategic \ninvestor  will  buy  into  ADBL  to  provide  the  leadership  needed  to  modernize  the  financial \ninstitution and make it more competitive. The government\u2019s ordinary shareholding at ADBL will \nalso be reduced to 21% by July 2011, in the first major financial privatization in Nepal. Along \nwith  the  capital  restructuring,  comprehensive  improvements  will  be  made  in  governance, \ntransparency,  organization,  marketing,  human  resources,  business  management,  portfolio \nmanagement, MIS, compliance, treasury, and internal audit in the second phase of the ADBL \ninstitutional restructuring. Consultants will assist ADBL management and staff in carrying out the \nrestructuring.  The  MIS  will  also  be  expanded  and  strengthened  to  enable  ADBL  to  offer \ntechnology-based financial services.15  \n \n16.  Institutional restructuring and reforms:\u00a0Small Farmers Development Bank. The \nADBL restructuring will be complemented by institutional reform of SFDB, an apex bank for \nsmall farmer cooperatives with a strong grassroots orientation. The SFDB reform will deepen \nrural finance outreach and make financial services more inclusive, especially to women. The \nSFDB  restructuring  plan  will  be  updated  and  implemented.  The  board  of  directors  will  be \nreconstituted,  the  management  professionalized,  a  portfolio  audit  carried  out,  the  bank \nreorganized, internal controls improved, an MIS installed, and private capital increased. An \ninternational microfinance institution development specialist and national experts will help SFDB \nimplement the plan under the grant project. The development of MIS for SFDB and SFDB \nmember cooperatives will also receive consultant support.16  \n \n17.  Strategies in the SFDB restructuring plan for expanding microfinance services in the hills \nand  mountain  areas  involve  (i) mapping  cooperatives,  self-help  groups,17  and  microfinance \nNGOs; (ii) assessing and rating institutions; (iii) designing a TA project and building capacity; \n                                                 \n14 The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal Act (1967) requires a person borrowing more than NRs10,000 from \nADBL to \u201chave purchased at least one share of ADBL (small shareholders).\u201d Small shareholders could be small \nfarmers, a group of small farmers, a village committee or cooperative institution. \n15 Agricultural Development Bank Limited Capital Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n16 Summary Small Farmers Development Bank Second Phase Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n17 Self-help groups are village-based financial intermediaries, usually composed of 10\u201315 local women, which are \nlargely unregistered and carry out voluntary savings and credit activities. \n   ", "  5\nand (iv) providing onlending support for outreach expansion.

Subprogram 2 looks \nforward to the successful privatization of the Far Western GBB19 and its transformation, with full \ntechnical advisory and capacity development support, into an effective grassroots financial \nintermediary.  \n \n19.  Sector capacity building. The RFSDCP advocates the establishment of a banking \ntraining institute to develop sector capacity. The National Banking Training Institute (NBTI), set \nup under subprogram 1, will continue to be assisted in raising professional standards throughout \nthe financial sector including rural and microfinance. An output under subprogram 2 will be the \nstart of professional training for a wide range of financial institutions. NBTI will hold short-term \ntraining, first in Kathmandu and later in other regions, and eventually long-term diploma and \ndegree programs. Under the grant project, consultant experts will (i) develop training curricula, \n(ii) assess the training needs of financial institutions, (iii) conduct classroom and off-site training, \n(iv) design in-house training programs for RFIs, and (v) arrange financial literacy training for \nrural communities. The project will also support the marketing, information dissemination, staff \ntraining, and other initial operating costs of NBTI. \n \n20.  Enabling infrastructure for rural finance. Subprogram 2 will fund the development of \nthe CIB\u2019s credit information services to class D institutions (micro-credit development banks, \nmicrofinance  NGOs  and  savings  and  credit  cooperatives).  CIB  will  begin  providing  credit \ninformation services to class D institutions and expand its client database from the present \n40,000 to 2 million, including small borrowers. An MIS will be developed at CIB under the grant \nproject to meet its larger data needs. The DRT, on the other hand, will undergo capacity \ndevelopment to speed up debt recovery and make it less costly. DRT staff will improve their \nskills in legal and financial management and office automation. DRT will also be given specialist \nassistance in legal, financial, and MIS aspects to strengthen its operating capacity. \n \n21.  Project management support. Project management and coordination assistance will \ncome from a rural finance specialist at the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The grant project will \nfinance the services of a consultant rural finance specialist for program implementation and the \ncapacity development needs of the program management unit of MOF.  \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing  \n \n22.  The overall adjustment cost of the ADBL restructuring is estimated at $145 million, \ncovered  as  follows:  (i)   $65 million  from  the  government\u2019s  loan  to  ADBL  converted  into \npreference shares, (ii) further $65 million in performance-linked equity in the form of preference \nshares  from  the  government  to  ADBL,  and  (iii) $15 million  equivalent  in  ADBL  staff  size \nreduction  through  voluntary  retirement.  The  government  injected  preference  shares  to \nrecapitalize ADBL and improve its capital adequacy ratio to the statutory level set by NRB. The \nRFSDCP cluster at the time of subprogram 1 approval amounted to $91 million comprising a \n$56 million loan for subprogram 1 and a $35 million loan for subprogram 2. The government \nused  the  entire  loan  proceeds  under  subprogram  1  to  recapitalize  ADBL  through  cash \nsubscriptions of additional preference shares equivalent to NRs3.9 billion. \n \n23.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR39,290,000 ($60.4 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \n                                                 \n18 Summary Strategies for Expanding Microfinance Services in Hills and Mountains (Appendix 2). \n19 GBBs started by replicating the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. There are now five GBBs, one each for the Eastern, \nFar-Western, Central, Mid-Western, and Western regions. \n   ", "6   \nthe adjustment cost of subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program \nagreement. The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $30 million will be \nreleased at loan effectiveness and the second tranche of $30.4 million will be released 24 \nmonths after the release of the first tranche. The release of the first tranche is subject to the \ncompliance of 16 conditions as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). Of 16 conditions, 14 \nwere fully complied. The two conditions: (i) the approval of the ADBL Capital Restructuring Plan, \nand (ii) endorsement of the SFDB Restructuring Plan by the Ministry of Finance and ADBL are \nin the process of being complied with. \n \n24.  The total amount for the RFSDCP cluster has been increased by $25.4 million to $116.4 \nmillion, reflecting the increase in local cost requirements, particularly for the establishment of the \nlegal and regulatory framework for RFI supervision, the further divestment of ADBL, and the \nstrengthening of rural finance outreach. More resources are needed for the expansion of rural \nfinance outreach in the post-conflict period. The counterpart funds will finance the structural \nadjustment costs of the government and the program implementing agencies relating to the \nimplementation of reforms under subprogram 2. \n \n25.  Grant project financing plan. The grant project will cost about $14.2 million (Table 1). \nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $12.1 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources to help finance the project. The financing plan is in Table 2. The grant proceeds will \nfinance  equipment,  international  and  national  consulting  services,  training,  a  credit  line, \nmanagement  support,  and  taxes  and  duties.  Although  some  implementing  agencies  are \noperating on a commercial basis, grant financing will be provided under the project for the \nexpansion of rural finance outreach because existing institutions will not normally undertake \nsuch financial inclusion activities nor attempt rural financial deepening for lack of economic \nincentives.20 For example, many rural areas of Nepal are remote and hence tend to be by-\npassed by financial institutions.

The experts will assist key government officials and ADBL management and staff in \nimplementing the second phase of the ADBL restructuring, and the ADBL capital restructuring.23 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic \n \n28.  The assessment of Nepal\u2019s performance in public finance management suggests the \nexistence of a system that is well designed but unevenly implemented. There has nonetheless \nbeen progress toward the transparent and accountable management of public finances.24 All the \nformal financial institutions in Nepal are supervised by NRB and undergo rigorous inspection \nwith various financial reporting requirements. NRB\u2019s supervisory capacity has improved over the \nyears  under  the  government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Reform  Program.  In  addition,  under \nsubprogram 2,  risks  in  public  fiscal  management  will  be  controlled  through  records  and \naccounts maintained by the government and the program implementing agencies in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.   In recent years, the government has taken a number of initiatives to address corruption, \nincluding the Promoting Market Competition Act (2006); Right to Information Act (2007); Special \nCourt Act (2002; amended in 2007); and Anti-Money Laundering Act (2008). The government \nhas also passed the Public Procurement Act (2007) and the Public Procurement Regulations \n(2007), both generally acceptable to ADB and encompassing best international procurement \npractices. The government has also established a \u201cprocurement watchdog\u201d in the form of the \nPublic Procurement Monitoring Office under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of \nMinisters.  Furthermore,  it  has  established  the  National  Vigilance  Centre  under  the  direct \nsupervision and control of the Prime Minister to control corruptions through preventive and \npromotional measures. RFSDCP is designed to reduce vulnerability to corruption by ensuring \nthat (i) the boards of financial institutions can monitor corruption and mismanagement in their \nown  institutions,  and  take  action  against  these  problems;  (ii)  all  relevant  institutions  take \nadequate  steps  to  improve  corporate  governance;  (iii)  all  relevant  institutions  and  the \ngovernment give assurances that they will abide by the transparency and disclosure stipulations \nof the NRB; and (iv) rigorous monitoring mechanisms are put in place to ensure continuous, \nproper accountabilities of mandated actions and full funds flow management. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty  \n \n30.  The institutional restructuring and reform of RFIs will strongly emphasize inclusiveness \nwhile improving operational and financial efficiency. Further, the support for SFDB will include \nextending access to financial services to the most remote areas. The financial and performance \nmonitoring of the institutional restructuring and reforms will cover outreach to marginalized groups \nand women.25  \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n31.  Adverse  impact  from  policy  and  institutional  reform  actions  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlements, and indigenous peoples is unlikely. The safeguard classification is C. \nThe  environmental  implication  of  the  SFDB  restructuring  for  financial  intermediation  was \n                                                 \n23 Agricultural Development Bank Limited Capital Restructuring Plan (Appendix 2). \n24 Government of Nepal. 2008.

Because of the micro scale of the investment activities of sub-borrowers, adverse \nenvironmental impact is unlikely.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  With the appropriate mitigation measures in place, the overall risk of subprogram 2 is \nlow.
