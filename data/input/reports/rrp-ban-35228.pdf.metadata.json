An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nand the summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  seek  to  (i)  improve  community  capabilities  to \ndevelop  and  manage  income-generating  activities  through  a \ntechnical  and  social  development  training  program;  (ii)  provide \nmicrofinance  and  technical  supporting  services  for  livestock \nenterprise  development,  including  assistance  to  the  ultrapoor \nthrough  a  pilot  program  of  asset  development  and  training;  (iii) \nbuild the capacity of the Department of Livestock Services (DLS); \nand  (iv)  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing  and  management \nagencies.  The  total  project  area  will  cover  157  subdistricts  in  20 \ndistricts; 68 of these subdistricts and 3 districts will be areas that \nhave  not  received  assistance  under  the  previous  Participatory \nLivestock Development Project.  \n \nThe  continued  development  of  viable  small  farmer  and  small \nbusiness  livestock  enterprises  is  an  essential  prerequisite  to \npoverty  reduction  in  the  rural  areas.  In  recent  years  innovative \ndevelopments in the livestock subsector have played an important \nrole  in  increasing  cash  incomes,  improving  food  quality  and \nquantity,  and  creating  employment  for  the  rural  poor.  Livestock \nenterprise  development  programs  have  been  particularly \nsuccessful \nreaching  poor  and  destitute  women.  The \naccompanying  microfinance  and  supporting  technical  services \ndelivered through groups have provided poor households with the \nknowledge  and  confidence \ntheir \ndevelopment enterprises. \n \nThe goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty in 20 districts of \nnorthwest  Bangladesh.  To  achieve  the  goal,  the  Project  will \nincrease \nfrom \nlivestock-related  enterprises \nthe  rural  poor,  particularly \nfor \nlandless  households  and  households  headed  by  women.  The \nProject  will  build  the  individual  and  community  capability  to \nmanage  production  enterprises;  it  will  provide  microfinance  for  a \nrange  of \nlivestock \nenterprises, small businesses, and marketing initiatives; and it will \nsupport  the  development  of  livestock  input  supply  services  and \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  private  sector.  The  Project  will \nspecifically target the ultrapoor to support their asset development \nand  social  mobilization.  DLS  capacity  building  will  also  be \nsupported. \n \n\nincome-generating  activities  and  employment \n\nincome-generating  activities \n\nto  expand  and  diversify \n\nincluding \n\nin \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.8  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $5.0 million, and local currency of \ninvestments \n$50.8  million  equivalent.

The loan will \nhave a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith  an  interest  charge  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter.  \n \nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \nThe Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) for components 1a, \npart  of  2a,  2b,  and  4  of  the  Project;  and  the  Department  of \nLivestock Services  for components 1b, part of 2a, 2c, and 3.  \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\nv\n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject  Benefits \nBeneficiaries \n\nand \n\nA project steering committee will be established to oversee project \nimplementation. PKSF, as Executing Agency for components 1a, \npart of 2a, 2b, and 4 will coordinate the project activities through \nthe projects division in its Dhaka office. It will establish a field-level \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  based  in  Rangpur,  staffed  by \nindependently recruited subject matter specialists and headed by \na project director to supervise all project activities. A working level \nimplementation  coordination  committee  will  be  established  to \nguide  the  PMU  on  a  more  regular  basis.  A  group  of  established \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  with  operational  networks \nin  the  project  area  will  implement  the  community  development \ncomponent  and  the  microfinanced  activities  in  the  livestock \nenterprise  development  component.  DLS  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  for  specialist  technical  training  and  provision  of  technical \nservices  as  required,  in  addition  to  DLS  capacity  building. \nConstruction  of \nlocal  markets  and  slaughter  slabs  will  be \nimplemented through the Local Government Engineering Department. \n \nAll procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Items  such  as  equipment  and  vehicles  will  be \nprocured through direct purchase. Civil works will comprise many \nsmall contract packages for improving infrastructure and facilities \nscattered  over  a  large  area.  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  from \nprequalified  local  contractors  through  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nA  team  of  consultants  will  support  project  implementation  and \nassist  PKSF  in  executing  the  Project.  A  committee  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  ADB,  PKSF,  and  DLS  will  select  the  PMU \nimplementation  consultants.  DLS  will  select  the  institutional \nchange consultants. The PMU implementation consultants will be \nselected  as  individuals  while  the  institutional  change  consultants \nwill  be  selected  from  firms.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  Quality  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be \nused in recruiting the consultants. ADB approved advance action \nfor Government recruitment of consultants. \n \nThe  main  project  benefits  will  be  the  incremental  production  of \neggs, young chickens, hens, fattened calves and goats, milk, and \nmilk  products.  The  incremental  output  will  be  consumed  by  the \nbeneficiaries, or sold in local and regional markets, with expected \naverage increases of at least 20% in the annual incomes of poor \nfamilies.  Intermediate  outputs  such  as  improved  day  old  chicks, \nfeed  ingredients,  and  hides  and  skins  will  also  be  sold  to  local \nproducers.  Livestock  services  such  as  extension  and  poultry \nvaccinations  will  also  rise,  particularly  as  the  private  sector \nincreasingly  provides  livestock  inputs.  The  Project  will  also  have \nenvironmental  benefits\u2014manure  produced  by  cattle  and  poultry \nwill be used as fertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nimproving \n\ntowards  poverty  reduction  by  (i) \n\nthe  nutritional  status  of  households \n\nThere  are  2.9  million  households  in  the  project  area.  It  is \nestimated  that  the  members  of  about  72%  of  these  households \n(2.1  million)  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The  Project  will  assist \n660,000 households (31% of the poor households), concentrating \nthe  activities  on  the  landless  and  households  headed  by  women \nthat  are  among  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  Of  the  660,000 \nhouseholds  to  receive  training  through  the  Project,  it  is  expected \nthat  at  least  250,000  households,  comprising  over  900,000 \npersons  in  the  very  poor,  poor,  or  marginal  categories  will  take \nloans. Another 50,000 beneficiaries are expected to adopt a range \nof  more  capital-intensive  enterprises.  Access  to  a  regular  and \nusable  flow  of  financial  and  social  resources  through  the  Project \nincreasing \nwill  contribute \nbeneficiaries\u2019  levels  of  empowerment,  particularly  with  regard  to \naccessing services; (ii) increasing the number of organized farmer \n(female  and  male)  groups;  (iii)  increasing  the  demand  for  labor \nbecause of the availability of resources for economic activities; (iv) \nincreasing  household  incomes  through  employment  generation; \n(v) \nthrough \nconsumption  of  livestock  and  dairy  products;  (vi)  increasing \nwomen\u2019s  employment;  and  (vii)  encouraging  the  growth  of \nenvironment-friendly economic enterprises.  \n \nThe Project has been designed to manage and mitigate risks. The \nProject\u2019s participatory planning approach will give the participating \nbeneficiaries flexibility in selecting enterprises and will ensure that \nthe  individual  makes  the  best  possible  choice.  Past  project \nexperience  indicates  that  the  risk  of  adverse  producer  prices  is \nminimal,  since  most  of  the  products  are  consumed  or  marketed \nlocally, with little outside competition at lower prices. Also, the low \n(but  growing)  consumption \nin \nBangladesh  also  indicate  that  household  consumption  and  local \nmarket  demand  will  readily  dispose  of  the  Project\u2019s  incremental \noutput  without  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  producer  prices. \nThe Government will take all necessary measures to mitigate the \nrisk of the outbreak of livestock diseases, including the increased \nuse  of  vaccines  supplied  by  the  private  sector,  availability  of \ncommunity extension workers to vaccinate animals, and improved \nDLS disease diagnostic services.  The risk of ADB loan funds not \nbeing used in the Project has been mitigated because recycling of \ncredit and the use of PKSF and NGOs\u2019 own resources were taken \ninto account in designing the Project. \n \n\nlivestock  products \n\nlevels  of \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\nvii\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Participatory  Livestock  Development \nProject.1 \n \n\nII.        RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\nA. \n \n2. \nLivestock and related enterprises and services play a prominent role in the economy of \nBangladesh  and  involve  large  numbers  of  rural  households.  The  livestock  subsector  is  labor \nintensive and its activities are evenly spread throughout the country, with an estimated 85% of \nall rural households owning some animals or poultry. The subsector contributes about 3% to the \ngross  domestic  product  and  provides  full-time  employment  for  about  20%  of  the  rural \npopulation. Over the last decade, changes in the livestock population have reflected the decline \nin  grazing  land  area  because  of  urban  expansion,  and  the  increased  market  opportunities  in \nurban  areas  for  higher  quality  and  more  diverse  foods.  The  total  number  of  beef  and  buffalo \nnumbers  (23  million)  has  only  increased  marginally,  while  the  number  of  dairy  cows  has \nincreased by about 50% as the demand for fresh milk has risen. Overall, from 1995 to 2000 the \nannual average growth in production was 2.7% for milk and milk products, 4.3% for meat, and \n7.7% for eggs, indicating an increasing demand for livestock products as a result of economic \ngrowth,  higher  incomes,  and  urbanization.  Goat  and  sheep  (14  million)  have  increased  only \nmarginally,  but  poultry  numbers  have  risen  by  72%  with  a  significant  growth  in  commercial \noperations around urban areas. \n \n3. \nThe livestock subsector is the primary source of animal power for land cultivation, which \nhas  historically  been  its  most  important  contribution.  In  recent  years,  however,  the  subsector \nhas  provided  an  increasing  volume  of  eggs,  broiler  meat,  and  milk  to  the  domestic  market. \nAlthough the per capita consumption of animal and poultry products remains low, the demand \nfor  milk,  meat,  and  eggs  will  be  proportionally  stronger  as  household  incomes  increase.  The \nsubsector  has  also  been  an  important  foreign  exchange  earner  through  the  export  of  hides, \nskins, and leather products. From 1995 to 2000, exports of these products earned about $190 \nmillion  per  year  accounting  for  up  to  5%  of  foreign  export  earnings  and  made  them  the  fourth \nlargest foreign exchange earner after garments, jute, and shrimp.   \n \nB. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  review  of  the  Bangladesh  livestock  sector2 \n4. \nconcluded that, although the subsector makes meaningful contributions to the economy and to \nemployment,  it  has  the  potential  to  expand  its  production  base  and  significantly  improve  rural \nlivelihoods  and  incomes,  especially  among  the  poor.  Most  livestock  are  still  managed \ntraditionally.  Feeding  is  inadequate  and  vulnerability  to  diseases  is  prevalent.  Production \ncoefficients  are  among  the  lowest  in  Asia,  and  all  types  of  livestock  record  high  mortalities. \nIndigenous  breeds  of  animals  and  poultry  predominate,  but  they  lack  the  genetic  potential  to \nrealize  the  benefits  of  better  management  and  disease  control.  The  technology  and  inputs \nrequired  to  improve  livestock  coefficients  and  overall  production  are  simple  and  proven,  but \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n1  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  provided.  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Second Participatory Livestock Development Project. Manila. \n\n2  ADB. 2001. Bangladesh Livestock Sector Review. Manila. \n\n\f 2\n\ntransfer  of  this  knowledge  has  not  been  sufficiently  extensive.  The  Department  of  Livestock \nServices  (DLS)  has  primary  responsibility  for  livestock  improvement.  While  DLS  has  a \nnationwide  network  of  staff  and  systems,  it  has  not  been  able  to  make  significant  changes  in \ntraditional  management  practices.  This  inability  to  change  prevailing  conditions  can  be  partly \nattributed to the technical culture of the DLS that principally views livestock improvement as a \nveterinary and animal husbandry challenge rather than an economic farming systems activity. \n \n5. \nThe ADB livestock sector review noted that nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have \ndeveloped  alternative  approaches  to  livestock  improvement  that  have  been  successful  in \nintroducing  better  management  systems  and  improved  breeds.  The  NGO  concept  treats \nlivestock  production  as  a  distinct  farming  enterprise  within  the  farming  system.  Small  farmers \nhave been offered a technical and microfinance package with the relevant supporting services. \nParticipating households have dramatically outperformed traditional management systems and \nsignificantly increased their overall income. A particular focus has been on landless households \nwith the development of inexpensive improved  poultry and other livestock enterprises. Income \nfrom  these  activities  has  made  a  major  contribution  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  target  areas. \nThese  households  have  not  been  able  to  access  microfinance  through  the  formal  banking \nsystem  to  invest  in  livestock  enterprises.  The  provision  of  microfinance  and  technical  support \nthrough NGOs addresses this need. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  planning  and  poverty  reduction  strategies  recognize  the  success  of \n6. \nthis new approach to livestock development and its effectiveness in raising incomes among the \npoorest  rural  households.  The  national  strategy  for  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial development3 places special emphasis on the role of the private sector and of NGOs in \nlivestock  development.  The  strategy  recommends  that  NGO  activities  concentrate  on  target \ngroup formation, training, extension, microfinance disbursement, supervision and recovery, and \nconducting  socioeconomic  studies.  The  strategy  also  stresses  that  public  sector  projects  with \nsimilar  components  should  be  implemented  by  NGOs.  The  strategy  emphasizes  the  need  for \nthe livestock sector to create additional income in rural areas through both service delivery and \nproduction. A plan for the future development of the livestock subsector is in Appendix 1. \n \nIn  its  country  operations  strategy4  and  its  partnership  agreement  on  poverty  reduction5 \n7. \nwith  the  Government,  ADB  has  recognized  the  important  role  that  the  livestock  subsector  can \nplay in poverty reduction by providing food, cash income, and employment opportunities for the \nrural  poor.  The  country  strategy  recommends  that  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  the  livestock \nsubsector should be to provide microfinance and policy support prioritizing the (i) development \nof  the  capabilities  of  NGOs  and  local  communities  to  plan,  research,  and  manage  livestock \ndevelopment;  (ii)  provision  of  additional  microfinance  to  the  poor  through  NGOs  and  other \nagencies;  (iii)  development  of  mechanisms  for  the  sustainability  of  NGO  operations  in  the \nsubsector; and (iv) support to DLS in reorienting its policies and service delivery.  \n \nADB\u2019s previous involvement in livestock development has been through three projects.6 \n8. \nThe first two were designed for and implemented by DLS. They focused on providing DLS with \n\n                                                 \n3 Government of Bangladesh. Ministry of Finance. 2003.

Report  and \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n3\n\ninfrastructure,  equipment,  and  training  for  a  range  of  livestock  industry  activities.  In  the  most \nrecent project, the Participatory Livestock Development Project  (PLDP), the emphasis shifted to \ndeveloping  small  farmer  enterprises  where  loan  funds  were  delivered  through  a  financial \nwholesaler,  the  Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF),  to  a  group  of  10  NGOs  for \nmicrofinanced  livestock  development  packages  for  poor  rural  farmers  with  DLS  technical \nsupport (para. 5). The PLDP benefited about 400,000 households, over 70% of them headed by \nwomen. An initial project impact evaluation in 2002 estimated that incomes rose by more than \n50% in the surveyed households. In addition, monthly household expenditures for food, clothing, \nand school expenses; and household savings7 showed significant (25\u201375%) increases. \n \n9. \nThe  PLDP  demonstrated  that  it  is  possible  to  successfully  deliver  a  large  number  of \ntechnically  supported,  microfinanced  livestock  improvement  packages  through  PKSF  and  its \npartner NGOs with DLS technical support. Impacts were positive on the income and standard of \nliving of poor households. However, a key lesson learned is that the PLDP\u2019s prescriptive design \nand targets did not provide the NGOs with sufficient flexibility to engage a wide range of poor \nhouseholds, particularly the ultrapoor. Similarly, the project design limited beneficiaries in their \nchoice  of  investment  enterprise,  and  opportunities  to  exploit  local  marketing  and  resource \nadvantages were lost. The proposed Project will offer a more extensive menu of enterprises to \nmaximize  livestock  development  opportunities,  and  enterprise  selection  will  be  demand  driven \nto allow local skills and production advantages to be fully used. \n \n10. \nOther external assistance to the livestock subsector has similarly supported small farmer \ndevelopment  initiatives  (Appendix  2).  The  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development \n(IFAD)  and  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  (Danida)  have  funded  smallholder \nlivestock  development  projects.  DLS  executed  these  projects  in  collaboration  with  several \nnational NGOs. Consistent with the Government\u2019s policy directives, the more recent externally \nfunded projects (PLDP, the Community Livestock and Dairy Development Project of the United \nNations Development Programme, and a recently approved IFAD microfinance project), used or \nwill  use  PKSF  and  participating  NGOs  as  executing  agencies,  with  DLS  providing  technical \nsupport.   \n \n11. \nA  reorientation  of  the  role  of  DLS  in  the  subsector  will  encourage  increased  private \nsector  investment  and  provision  of  services.  The  continued  presence  of  DLS  in  providing \nselected subsidized input supplies acts as a disincentive to private companies.8 There is need to \ndirect  DLS\u2019s  resources  into  those  areas  where  it  has  a  comparative  advantage  and  national \nresponsibility. ADB\u2019s livestock sector review has highlighted the need for a new policy direction \nfor  DLS.  Danida  is  supporting  a  Policy  and  Planning  Support  Unit  (PPSU)  in  the  Ministry  of \nFisheries and Livestock (MFL) that is providing technical assistance to support this process. The \ncontinued  expansion  of  the  role  of  NGOs  and  private  companies  in  livestock  production \ninitiatives and provision of services will allow DLS to concentrate on the core tasks of disease \ncontrol at the borders, disease diagnostic services, and quarantine management.  \n \n12. \nBuilding on the achievements of the PLDP and past projects, there are opportunities to \nfurther expand the scope of livestock development to include a wider range of production and \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Participatory Livestock Development Project. Manila. \n\n7 The PLDP  was closed on 10 July 2003. Achievement  of its development objectives  and implementation progress \n\nwere highly satisfactory. The project completion report will  be prepared in 2004. \n\n8  DLS has been working toward compliance with the action plan prepared in the PLDP to commercialize its poultry \nproduction  farms  and  the  veterinary  vaccine  production  laboratory.  The  revised  action  plan  specifies  that  full \nproduction costs at the laboratory will be recovered by 30 June 2005. \n\n\f \n\n 4\n\ninput supply enterprises. Up to 30 June 2003 in the PLDP, 265,000 beneficiaries had borrowed \nabout  $36  million,  with  almost  a  100%  repayment  rate,  to  finance  livestock  production \nenterprises.  Some  beneficiaries  borrowed  multiple  times,  indicating  willingness  of  the  poor  to \nborrow  funds  to  invest  in  livestock  production.  As  NGOs  become  more  experienced,  they  can \noffer a more diversified investment program under the proposed Project that would include beef, \ndairy,  and  goat  enterprises;  small-scale  product  processing  units;  and  input  supply  services. \nProspective  project  beneficiaries  have  shown  interest  in  investing  in  such  enterprises.  NGOs \nhave the capacity to provide complementary training to satisfy the growing demand from farmer \ncommunities  for  skills  in  product  marketing  and  providing  their  own  disease  control  and  feed \nsupply  services.  The  proposed  Project  will  support  these  new  and  diversified  opportunities \nthrough a demand-driven training and investment program. \n \n13.  While small-scale livestock development projects have been successful in improving the \nlivelihoods of  large  numbers  of  poor  households,  existing programs  such  as  the  PLDP  still  do \nnot reach many families. These families are in the ultrapoor category at the lowest level of the \npoverty  strata,  surviving  on  day  labor  or  begging  and  with  no  confidence  or  prospects  of \nimproving  their  situation.  Several  NGOs  have  developed  programs  that  provide  training  and \nasset  development  for  ultrapoor  households  as  a  preliminary  stage  to  graduating  into \nmicrofinanced  livestock  enterprise  investments.  The  proposed  Project  would  finance  a  pilot \nprogram to support ultrapoor households in those subdistricts where families are vulnerable to \nflood damage and lose land through river erosion.    \n\n14. \nThe  existing  market  system  for  livestock  appears  to  function  relatively  effectively  and \nefficiently. The well-developed supply chains and marketing competition have steadily expanded \nsales. There still remain opportunities for farmers to increase their returns through improved and \nbetter-informed  marketing  practices.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  increasing  the \nnumber  of  rural  marketing  facilities  is  a  means  of  improving  sale  prices  in  remote  rural  areas. \nThe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is implementing an established market \ngrowth  center  program.  In  addition  to  market  development,  improved  management  of  the \nhygiene  of  slaughter  facilities  and  slabs  is  needed.  Consumer  awareness  programs  on  meat \nquality,  combined  with  training  programs  in  meat  handling  and  hygiene  for  local  butchers  and \nmeat sellers, are required to improve the situation. \n \n15. \nThe  poverty  reduction  strategies  of  both  the  Government  and  ADB  recognize  that  the \ncontinued  development  of  viable  small  farmer  and  agribusiness  enterprises  is  essential  to \npoverty reduction in the rural areas. Opportunities to engage large numbers of poor households \nin  rural  enterprises  are  limited,  but  innovative  small  farmer  developments  in  the  livestock \nsubsector have increased cash incomes, improved food quality and quantity, and created more \nemployment  for  the  rural  poor.  The  proposed  Project  will  further  develop  these  opportunities \nthrough  an  integrated  program  of  training  and  enterprise  investment  that  will  increase  the \ncapabilities of the target communities and broaden poverty reduction impacts. \n \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\n16. \nThe Project aims to reduce rural poverty in 20 districts of northwest Bangladesh (Map, p. \nvii)  by  increasing  income-generating  activities  and  employment  in  livestock-related  enterprises \nfor  the  rural  poor,  particularly  landless  households  and  households  headed  by  women.  The \nProject  will  (i)  build  individual  and  community  capability  to  identify  and  manage  production \nenterprises;  (ii)  provide  microfinance  for  a  range  of  income-generating  activities  including \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n5\n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nlivestock  enterprises,  small  businesses,  and  marketing  initiatives;  and  (iii)  support  the \ndevelopment  of  livestock  input  supply  services  and  employment  opportunities  in  the  private \nsector. The Project will specifically target the ultrapoor and support them in asset development \nand social mobilization. DLS capacity building will also be supported. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  seek  to  improve  community  capabilities  to  develop  and  manage \nincome-generating  activities,  through  a  technical  and  social  development  training  program;  (ii) \nprovide  microfinance  and  technical  supporting  services  for  livestock  enterprise  development, \nincluding assistance to the ultrapoor through a pilot program of asset development and training; \n(iii) build DLS capacity; and (iv) support the Project\u2019s implementing and management agencies. \nThe  total  project  area  will  cover  157  subdistricts  in  20  districts;  68  of  these  subdistricts  and  3 \ndistricts will be areas that have not received assistance under the PLDP. The project framework \nis in Appendix 3. \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Development  \n\n \n\na. \n\nCommunity Mobilization \n\nTo  reduce  their  vulnerabilities  and  expand  opportunities  for  them,  the  poor  must  be \n18. \nassisted  to  achieve  certain  social  assets,  such  as  supportive  ties  with  other  members  of  their \ncommunities;  mutual  support  within  their  own  organizations;  and  access  to  government \nadministrative and service agencies, and resources. The Project intends to reach approximately \n660,000  poorer  farming  families  (32%  of  poverty-affected  households  in  the  project  area), \nprimarily  households  not  covered  under  the  PLDP.  For  the  poverty  reduction  investment,  the \nProject  will  target  poor  people\u2014particularly  women\u2014who  are  categorized  as  landless,  small \nmarginal farmers, and farmers of the riverbed flood areas and riverbank areas.  \n \n19. \nThrough  training  programs  delivered  by  participating  NGOs,  this  component  will  help \ncommunities  mobilize  into  groups,  develop  an  awareness  of  marketing  and  enterprise \nopportunities,  and  improve  farmers\u2019  capabilities  to  use  microfinance  and  other  input  services \neffectively.  With  NGO  support,  groups  will  be  encouraged  to  form  associations  that  take  a \nbroader  view  of  community  issues  and  interests,  as  the  basis  for  empowering  communities  to \naddress  and  make  community  issues  known  at  higher  government  levels  (subdistrict  and \ndistrict), and thus enable the poor to demand accountability for public resources spent locally. \nGiven  the  target  population,  the  number  of  groups  to  be  formed  and  strengthened  under  the \nProject will be approximately 26,000.  \n \n20. \nIn the PLDP, the NGO delivery system focused on basic farmer technical training and on \nmicrofinance  delivery  and  recovery.  Experience  indicates  that  a  more  balanced  and  multi-\nfaceted approach to delivery of farmer services is needed. Besides livestock technology, social \ndevelopment  and  microfinance/agribusiness  management  services  need  to  be  made  available \nto  farmers.  Under  the  Project,  the  NGO  staffing  ratio  to  farming  families  will  be  reduced  from \n1:500  to  1:300.  Participating  NGOs  will  deploy  field  staff  to  primary  groups  on  the  basis  of \napproximately 1 field worker for 14 groups (300 members). This will enable the field worker to \nattend  weekly  group  meetings,  provide  on-site  training  and  facilitate  technical  support,  and \nmonitor project implementation.  \n \n21. \nThe project management unit (PMU) will recruit NGOs and specialized service providers \nto handle training in milk chilling center operation, in developing a cadre of milk entrepreneurs, \n\n\f 6\n\nmilk  treatment,  and  marketing.  Similarly,  training  and  capability  development  are  proposed  for \nlive  animal  market  management  committees,  butchers,  and  meat  shop  owners.  Farmer  group \nleaders  and  members  will  be  trained  in  the  technical  and  business  aspects  of  enterprise \nmanagement.  Groups  and  individuals  will  be  trained  to  manage  local  processing,  marketing, \nand  input  supply  activities.  Existing  traders,  including  those  involved  in  livestock  selling,  milk \nvending, and animal health drug supply will be included in this training subcomponent. \n \n\nb. \n\nCommunity Extension Workers \n\n22. \nCommunities will also be assisted to develop the capacity to service their own livestock \nimprovement needs through training of local community extension workers (CEWs) selected by \nNGOs based on agreed upon criteria. The CEWs will earn income with the community paying \nfor their services in cash or in kind. CEWs will provide on-demand service in livestock extension, \nanimal  vaccination,  drug  supply,  forage  inputs,  group  strengthening,  and  a  link  between \nindividual  farmers  and  their  organizations  and  DLS  or  NGOs.  To  facilitate  this  process,  the \nProject will support basic animal health, disease diagnosis and control, and production services \ndelivery  from  livestock  service  centers  operating  at  union  council  level  from  the  union  council \ncomplexes, or NGO area offices. The CEWs will be key actors in the centers, supported by the \nNGOs  and  subdistrict  DLS  staff  as  required.  To  improve  the  delivery  and  impact  of  livestock \ntechnical training in the target communities, DLS will train the CEWs as trainers. These training \nskills  will  allow  the  CEWs  to  improve  the  skills  of  farmer  groups  and  entrepreneurs  of  small \nlivestock input supplies.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLivestock Enterprise Development  \n\na. \n\nLivestock Enterprises \n\n23. \nThis subcomponent will provide about 300,000 households with microfinance (including \na  savings  program)  for  livestock  enterprises.  Participating  households  will  be  identified  and \nselected through the regular participatory methods used by PKSF and its partner NGOs.  About \n20 poultry, ruminant, and supporting input supply enterprises have been identified as financially \nprofitable and sustainable. With NGO and DLS assistance, qualified households will select the \nmost  appropriate  enterprise  to  match  their  capability,  physical  resources,  and  local  market \ndemands. Microfinance will cover livestock, equipment, and infrastructure.  \n \n24. \nNGOs  will  implement  all  facets  of  this  component  with  full  beneficiary  participation,  in \ncooperation  with  DLS.  PKSF  will  select  the  NGOs  on  the  basis  of  their  existing  microfinance \nmanagement  performance,  their  operational  strength  in  the  project  area,  and  the  quality  and \ndepth  of  their  supporting  technical  and  community  development  staff  resources.  To  take \nadvantage  of  the  existing  skills  base  and  implementing  experience  and  knowledge  of  farmer \ngroups  and  area  networks,  preference  will  be  given  to  NGOs  that  participated  in  the  PLDP. \nHowever, PKSF will use NGO selection criteria that will require the NGOs to have and maintain \nfor the project period suitably qualified technical, social mobilization, training, and microfinance \nmanagement  staff.  NGOs  will  derive  their  individual  annual  investment  programs  from \nparticipatory planning exercises with beneficiaries, and the plans will be finalized in consultation \nwith the PMU.  \n \n25. \nAs  the  scale  and  composition  of  the  actual  beneficiary  investments  will  be  developed \nthrough  participatory  planning,  the  phasing  and  costing  of  the  component\u2019s  activities  will  be \nindicative. However, it is expected that about 250,000 microfinance packages will be provided to \nfirst-time  borrowers  in  the  new  project  area  of  subdistricts.  These  loans  are  likely  to  be  for \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n7\n\npoultry,  small  ruminant,  and  input  supply  enterprises.  About  50,000  credit  packages  for  more \nsophisticated  enterprises  will  be  provided  to  borrowers  that  have  successfully  undertaken \nprevious  livestock  projects  in  the  area  and  are  ready  to  expand  their  income-generating \nactivities. \n \n26. \nDLS  will  also  provide  technical  support  to  the  participating  NGOs  as  required.  Such \nsupport  will  include  technical  training  to  NGO  trainers,  and  backup  disease  diagnostic  work. \nDLS  will  recruit  and  assign  one  DLS  subdistrict  livestock  officer  to  each  participating  NGO  to \ncoordinate  such  services  and  ensure  that  the  support  services  are  delivered  effectively.  The \nPMU will also use contract service providers for specialized services. \n \n27. \nA pilot program will be implemented to support social and enterprise development, and \nthe establishment of an initial asset base for ultrapoor households. The underlying objective will \nbe to capture those very poor households that have either not participated in income-generating \nenterprise  programs,  or  previously  participated  but  dropped  out.  PKSF  will  implement  the \nprogram.  The  criteria  for  identifying  qualified  beneficiaries  will  include  households  that  (i) \ndepend  on  income  from  female  day  work  or  begging;  (ii)  own  less  than  0.04  hectare  of  land \nincluding the homestead; (iii) have no adult active male member; (iv) if children are present, are \nunable  to  pay  for  schooling;  and  (v)  do  not  receive  current  assistance  from  any  other \ngovernment  or  NGO  supporting  program.  In  addition,  the  household  should  have  at  least  one \nactive adult woman that can be involved in an income-generating activity. The beneficiaries will \nbe  identified  through  a  combination  of  surveys,  focus  group  discussions,  and  community-level \nmeetings.  Locally  based  staff  will  use  participatory  assessment  tools  to  select  the  most \nvulnerable households.  \n \n28. \nAfter households have been selected, program staff will initially train each household on \nasset  transfer,  health  management,  and  social  responsibilities.  Awareness  raising  training  will \nbe provided. Participants will choose income-generating activities from a variety of poultry, goat, \nbeef and dairy cattle, vegetable, and nursery and small trading enterprises provided in kind as a \ngrant,  together  with  the  appropriate  technical  training.  A  disaster  management  fund  will  be \ninitiated  as  a  safety  net  against  loan  default  caused  by  natural  disasters.  A  flexible  savings \nprogram  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  program,  and  participants  will  be  encouraged  to  save \nmoderate sums to refinance their future enterprise activities. Underpinning the program will be \nweekly  intensive  follow-up  and  supervision  that  will  guide  and  support  the  participants.  The \nprogram will be implemented in 2004 and 2005 and will involve 5,000 households. \n \n \n \n29. \nNGOs  with  cash-flow-based  lending  experience  will  provide  credit  for  small-scale  peri-\nurban milk processing and retailing entrepreneurs, traders in other livestock products, and larger \ninput supply enterprises under this subcomponent. It has been estimated that there could be a \ndemand during the project period for additional milk collection and small-scale milk chilling units, \nand for batch pasteurizing and packaging units that would produce small milk packs for the local \nurban markets. The Project will support the development of markets and slaughter slabs as part \nof the Government\u2019s market growth center program for the rural areas. About 150 new livestock \nmarkets in existing market growth centers will be built, about 50 existing livestock markets will \nbe  improved,  and  about  50  slaughter  slabs  will  be  supplied  in  market  livestock  corners  to \nspecific  livestock-owning  communities  where  these  investments  would add  significant  value  to \nfarmer returns. LGED will build new livestock markets only on land that is already owned by the \nGovernment.  No  resettlement  of  people,  including  squatters,  will  be  involved.  In  addition,  the \n\nMarketing and Small Business Development  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\nPMU will provide funds for marketing promotions, and a consumer awareness program on meat \nhygiene. \n \n\nc. \n\nInnovation and Applied Research \n\n30. \nThis  subcomponent  will  be  executed  by  DLS  to  provide  applied  research  and  initial \ncapital for innovations that would directly assist small livestock farmers to increase their income \nearning  and  marketing  opportunities.  It  will  explore  development  opportunities  for  new  poultry \nbreeds  that  could  raise  productivity  levels  in  the  village  environment,  and  new  management \nsystems  that  could  better  use  feed  and  labor  resources.  It  will  investigate  the  improvement  of \nthe black Bengal goat breed, and systems for improved feed storage and nutrient enhancement. \nTo  raise  the  performance  of  beef  and  dairy  cattle  at  the  village  level,  emphasis  will  be  on  the \ncultivation and use of higher-value forage in existing farming systems. DLS, in cooperation with \nthe  PMU,  will  prepare  annually  a  schedule  of  research  subprojects  that  will  be  circulated  to \nresearch  organizations,  individual  researchers,  university  departments,  and  other  suitably \nstaffed  organizations  for  tendering.  Successful  applicants  will  be  contracted  by  the  PMU.  The \nDLS technical specialists attached to the PMU will evaluate the performance of the subprojects. \nIn  addition,  there  will  be  opportunities  for  stakeholders  to  develop  their  own  applied  research \nproposals for project funding.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building for the Department of Livestock Services \n\nthinking,  and  capacity  building; \n\n31. \nA  comprehensive  institutional  analysis  and  future  development  plan  for  DLS  was \nprepared in 2003 with Danida and PPSU support. MFL is in the process of approving the 3-year \nand  10-year  action  plans,  to  be  supported  by  Danida,  to  transform  DLS  into  a  facilitator  and \nregulator  of  sector  development,  a  promoter  of  private  sector  development,  with  the  goal  of \ncontributing to poverty reduction. The Project, in cooperation with the Danida-funded PPSU, will \nsupport the change process as DLS and its staff begin to redefine their functions and orientation \nto become facilitators of change, rather than continue as technical extension agents. To assist \nin reorienting the staff members who will become department managers in the next decade, a \npostgraduate  diploma  program  in  leadership  and  management  dealing  with  development  and \nsocial  change;  systems,  strategic \nfinancial  resource \nmanagement; interorganizational relations networks, and partnerships and coalitions; and policy \ndevelopment and advocacy will be made available to DLS district and subdistrict staff, including \nwomen,  primarily  located  within  the  project  area.  This  training,  to  be  provided  by  local  and \nforeign universities, is highly relevant to the future needs of the DLS. It will provide a cadre of \nofficers that are equipped to plan and make the changes in DLS\u2019s future role and policies. The \nProject  will  also  support  the  creation  of  a  DLS  headquarters  institutional  change  team,  and \nsupport DLS staff skills development in essential areas, as specified in the action plan for DLS\u2019s \nfuture  development.  The  DLS  monitoring  and  evaluation  cell  will  also  be  strengthened.  Funds \nwill  be  provided  for  construction  of  some  DLS  facilities,  such  as  27  subdistrict  livestock \ndevelopment  centers,  and  disease  monitoring  will  be  strengthened.  DLS  will  implement  this \ncomponent, and the PPSU will monitor and support effective implementation.  \n \n32.  MFL  and  DLS  have  prepared  a  revised  action  plan  to  (i)  phase  out  the  remaining \nsubsidies  on  livestock  products  produced  by  DLS;  (ii)  continue  commercialization  of  the \nveterinary vaccine production laboratory, with the objective of having the private sector become \nthe major supplier of vaccines in the country by 30 June 2005 at the latest; and (iii) continue the \ncommercialization of Government-owned poultry production farms in the project area, with the \nobjective of making the private sector the major producer of day-old chicks in the country by 30 \nJune 2005 at the latest. The Project will assist DLS in implementing the action plan by providing \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n9\n\nspecialist  assistance  as  required  (Assurances,  [xi]).  The  existing  policy  environment  and \ncommercializing these functions will not be an impediment to the project\u2019s implementation, given \nthat  NGOs  and  the  private  sector  already  supply  about  75%  of  the  market  for  many  livestock \ninputs.     \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Services  \n\na. \n\nProject Management \n\n33. \nThe  Project  will  provide  PKSF  with  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  support  the \neffective  management  and  coordination  of  project  activities.  PKSF  will  appoint  a  project \nmanager  and  staff  for  a  small  liaison  office  in  Dhaka.  PKSF  and  DLS  will  also  appoint  project \ndeputy  directors  to  the  PMU.  The  Project  will  provide  funding  for  an  independently  recruited, \nprofessional  PMU  that  will  be  located  in  Rangpur  in  the  project  area,  and  will  be  staffed  by  a \nteam  of  domestically  recruited  specialists,  including  (i)  a  rural  development  specialist  (project \ndirector);9  (ii)  training  and  livestock  improvement  specialist;  (iii)  monitoring,  evaluation  and \nmanagement  information  specialist;  and  (iv)  accountant.  DLS  will  also  assist  the  PMU  by \nassigning specialist staff to it as required. \n \n\nb. \n\nImplementation \n\n34. \nNGOs selected by the PMU will be allocated operational areas, and will be responsible \nfor delivering microfinance and training services to the participating beneficiaries. The NGOs will \nuse existing area offices or establish new ones as their operational base. To assist the NGOs in \nestablishing  their  outreach  capability  in  the  new  project  area,  the  Project  will  provide  limited \nsupport  for  small  motorcycles  and  bicycles,  equipment,  and  furniture  in  new  subdistrict  area \noffices,  and  for  new  participating  NGOs.  While  the  project  microfinance  and  training  activities \nare initially being developed, the salaries and operating costs of these offices will be funded by \nthe Project for 2 years until the new NGOs have generated sufficient savings from their lending \nmargins  to  finance  the  overhead  costs.  After  this  period,  the  NGO  area  offices  will  be  self-\nfinancing using their lending margins.  \n \nSpecial Features \nC. \n \n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  provide  training  and  microfinance  to  individuals  and  communities  to \nassist  them  in  developing  a  range  of  sustainable  rural  enterprises  that  will  raise  incomes  and \nincrease employment in the project area. The Project will use a participatory planning process \nthat will recognize the different needs of beneficiaries, and it will respond with specific options \nand  solutions.  Unlike  its  predecessors,  the  Project  is  not  prescriptive  and  is  not  target  driven. \nExpected project outputs are indicative, but are firmly focused on raising rural incomes across \nthe full spectrum of poor households, and particularly of poor women, with the expectation that \npoverty in the project area will be significantly reduced. \n \n36. \nThe Project will be implemented by NGOs with full beneficiary participation. The project \nplanning and delivery services require that project management and the implementing agencies \nhave a broad understanding of rural development issues, and extensive experience in working \nwith  rural  communities.  An  independently  recruited  group  of  specialists  will  staff  the  PMU. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n9  A  rural  development  specialist,  preferably  with  livestock  experience,  is  considered  appropriate  because  of  the \nProject\u2019s  emphasis  on  community  development,  participatory  processes,  and  delivery  of  microfinance  to  the \nbeneficiaries. \n\n\fProject implementation will be carried out by qualified NGOs\u2014each of which has an operational \nnetwork in the project area\u2014and DLS.  \n \n37. \n A key output will be an enhanced capacity to sustain and expand commercial enterprise \nand  community  development  after  the  Project  has  concluded.  Farmer  groups  that  have \nestablished  their  own  self-employed  extension  workers  (for  vaccinations,  forage  development, \nand  animal  breeding  services),  and  that  have  worked  together  in  larger  associations  will  be \nbetter  positioned \ntheir  production  and  marketing  operations.  Also, \nparticipating NGOs, especially those with small local outreach areas, will be better equipped to \ncontinue and diversify their activities beyond the project period.   \n\nfurther  develop \n\nto \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nD. \n \n38. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $55.8  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  service  charges  during  construction.  The \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $5.0  million,  or  about  9%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $50.8 million equivalent, or about 91% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency costs include an estimated $1.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by \nthe  Government,  PKSF,  and  the  beneficiaries.

The  loan  will  finance  $4.7  million  of  the \nforeign exchange cost (94% of the total foreign exchange cost) and $15.3 million equivalent of \nthe  local  currency  cost  (30%  of  the  total  local  currency  cost).  Danida  will  provide  $0.5  million \nparallel and tied grant financing, or 1% of the project cost, for DLS capacity building. PKSF has \nbeen requested to provide $16.5 million equivalent, or 29% of the project cost. The participating \nNGOs  will  contribute  $11.1  million  equivalent,  or  20%  of  the  project  cost.  The  beneficiary \nhouseholds that receive microfinance packages will contribute $2.1 million or 4% of the project \ncost  through  their  labor  and  cash  inputs  in  establishing  the  livestock  and  small  business \nenterprises. Local cost financing is justified, given the poverty-oriented nature of the Project and \nthe tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n40. \nThe Borrower will be the Government of Bangladesh. The ADB loan will have a maturity \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% \nduring  the  grace  period  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.5%  per  annum  during  the  amortization \nperiod. The Government will relend to PKSF the portion of the ADB loan required for carrying \nout the microfinance and credit lending activities in parts of components 2a and b of the Project, \nin accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary loan and grant agreement. The Government \nwill provide the funds for components 1a, parts of 2a and 2b, and 4 to PKSF as a grant. Funds \nfor components 1b, part of 2a, 2c, and 3 will be provided to DLS. The subsidiary loan and grant \nagreement  will  contain  procedures,  terms  and  conditions,  and  implementation  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. PKSF will in turn onlend to participating NGOs under subloan agreements, \nand  NGOs  will  use  these  funds  as  microfinance  for  farmers  and  entrepreneurs.  The  subloan \nagreements  will  specify  procedures,  terms  and  conditions,  and  implementation  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.

DLS will be the EA for components 1b, part of 2a, 2c, and 3. DLS will appoint a project \ndeputy director to be based in Rangpur in the PMU and to supervise DLS project activities. DLS \nand PKSF performed well in the PLDP. PKSF has managed three projects for the World Bank, \nthe IFAD Employment Generation Project, and participated in the PLDP, and has demonstrated \nthe  ability  to  coordinate  effectively  and  manage  microfinance  and  related  services  with \nparticipating NGOs. PKSF has the necessary organizational structure and staff skills to manage \nsuccessfully a large and diverse development project. It has also shown a readiness to recruit, \nfor project execution, additional staff with required technical and social development skills. DLS \neffectively  managed  the  PLDP.  Participating  NGOs  will  be  required  to  meet  rigorous  selection \nand performance criteria. Most NGOs that participated in the PLDP demonstrated their capacity \nto provide community development and technical training, and microfinance to beneficiaries on \na  sustainable  basis,  even  to  the  extent  of  using  their  own  financial  resources  to  lend  to \nbeneficiaries. \n \nA project steering committee10 will be established to oversee the implementation of the \n42. \nProject.    The  committee  will  meet  as  necessary,  but  not  less  than  once  a  year,  to  review \nprogress.  PKSF  will  appoint  a  project  manager  to  coordinate  its  project  activities  through  the \nProjects  Division  in  its  Dhaka  office.  An  implementation  coordination  committee  will  be \nestablished to guide the PMU on a regular basis.11 PKSF, in cooperation with DLS, will establish \na  field-level  PMU  based  in  Rangpur  staffed  by  independently  recruited  subject  matter \nspecialists,  and  headed  by  a  project  director.  The  project  organization  chart  is  in  Appendix  5. \nThe  PPSU  will  support  the  DLS  capacity  building  component  and  effective  coordination  of \nproject activities. \n \n43. \nThe PMU will act as a facilitating agency. It will (i) prepare annual work plans, and the \nrelevant project reports in consultation with the implementing NGOs and other service providers; \n(ii) supervise all project activities and the performance of the implementing agencies and service \nproviders;  and  (iii)  carry  out  field-level  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  activities,  project \noutputs,  and  expected  impacts.  Unlike  in  the  PLDP,  the  PMU  will  be  adequately  staffed  with \nqualified and independently recruited specialists to ensure implementation effectiveness. PKSF \nand DLS have also appointed deputy project directors to the PMU, and LGED has designated a \nproject  coordinator.  A  committee  composed  of  representatives  of  ADB,  PKSF,  and  DLS  will \nselect  the  PMU  staff,  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PMU  will  be  accountable  to \nPKSF, and PKSF will be accountable to the Government for the Project, with the exception of \nthe components implemented by DLS.   \n                                                 \n10 The secretaries of the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and MFL will cochair the committee; the \ncore  members  will  include  representatives  of  the  Economics  Relations  Division  (ERD)  of  the  MOF,  the  Planning \nCommission  and  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  and \nthe Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development; and the managing director of PKSF. Other members will \ninclude  representatives  of  DLS  (director  general),  PKSF,  LGED,  and  participating  NGOs.  The  committee  will  not \nmake any decisions that infringe on the policies and procedures of PKSF. \n\n11A  deputy  managing  director  of  PKSF  or  other  representative  of  PKSF  will  chair  the  committee,  and  the  core \nmembers will include representatives of the ERD and the Finance Division of MOF, the Planning Commission, and \nthe IMED of the Ministry of Planning, DLS, LGED, and the MFL; the PKSF and DLS deputy project directors, and \nthe  LGED  project  coordinator;  and  the  PMU  project  director.  Other  members  or  observers  may  include \nrepresentatives of participating NGOs and the PPSU. \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n13\n\n \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent Implementation \n\n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nA  group  of  established  NGOs  with  operational  networks  in  the  project  area  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies for the training programs under the community development component \nand  the  microfinance  activities  in  the  livestock  enterprise  development  component  to  ensure \nsustainable  development  in  the  subsector.  As  needed,  they  will  utilize  other  agencies  for \nspecialized  training.  Qualified  NGOs  will  deliver  and  manage  the  credit  activities  in  the \nmarketing  and  small  business  development  subcomponent.  PKSF  and  the  NGOs  will  sign \nagreements regarding NGO responsibilities for project implementation activities, accountability, \nand repayment of loans to PKSF. DLS and other service providers will support the delivery of \ntechnical services (including the innovation subcomponent) and technical training to NGOs, and \nwill  act  as  facilitator  for  livestock  improvement  in  the  project  area.  PKSF  will  provide  funds  to \nLGED  to  implement  and  execute  construction of  local  markets  and  slaughter  slabs.  PKSF  will \nimplement the subcomponent for the ultrapoor.  \n  \n \n\n3. \n \n45. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, beginning in the second quarter of \n2004.  Initial  activities  will  be  recruiting  consultants  for  the  PMU;  establishing  a  project \nperformance management system (PPMS) in PKSF to monitor microfinance delivery and project \nefficiency and effectiveness; carrying out benchmark surveys, participatory rapid appraisals and \ncommunity  discussions;  and  procuring  of  essential  equipment  and  vehicles.  Enterprise \ndevelopment and microfinance disbursements in new project areas will be delivered starting in \nthe  second  quarter  of  2005,  while  in  the  PLDP  areas,  these  activities  will  continue  without \ninterruption. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n \n\n4. \n \n46. \nSupervised  microfinance  and  social  intermediation  activities  have  a  high  cost.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  part  of  the  concessionality  of  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  loan  will  be \nused  to  provide  an  adequate  interest  spread  to  cover  all  costs,  provision  for  bad and  doubtful \ndebts,  and  an  adequate  profit  margin.  The  Government  will  relend  $7.5  million  equivalent  to \nPKSF at a service charge of 1.25% a year for 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The \nBorrower  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for  the  ADB  loan.  PKSF  now  has  a  policy  of \nonlending to participating NGOs at an interest rate of not more than 4.5\u20137%, depending on the \nNGO\u2019s size, with a repayment period of up to 3 years. This low onlending margin is designed to \npermit  participating  NGOs  to  use  their  interest  spread  to  fund  training  and  capacity-building \nactivities. The PKSF lending spread of 3.25\u20135.75% will be used to cover the cost of evaluating \nand  selecting  NGOs,  monitoring  their  performance,  and  training  NGO  staff  in  financial \nmanagement;  other  operating  costs;  credit  risks;  and  profit.12  Participating  NGOs  will  pass  on \nthe proceeds of the PKSF subloan to poultry, beef-fattening, and goat-rearing (and other small \nanimals) smallholders; and to entrepreneurs investing in processing enterprises at the prevailing \nmarket rate, currently around 20% declining balance, keeping a margin of about 15% to cover \nsocial  mobilization,  group  formation  and  social  awareness  training,  skills  training,  monitoring \nloan collection and extension activities, other operating costs, and allowance for bad debts.  \n \n \n\nLending Terms and Conditions \n\n                                                 \n12 This margin is sufficient to cover PKSF\u2019s credit risk since, as of June 2003, the NGO repayment rate to PKSF was \n\n98.4%. \n\n\f 14\n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n5. \n \n47. \nGoods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Since  any  civil  works  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed, \nforeign  contractors  are  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding.  Consequently,  all  civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nPrequalification,  selection,  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  the  approval  of \nADB. The concerned LGED district executive engineer, under the guidance of the LGED project \ncoordinator, will award contracts for livestock market improvements. LGED will award contracts \nfor  infrastructure  construction  and  improvement  that  prioritize  the  involvement  of  poor  people. \nThere  may  not  be  supply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or \nmore;  but  should  a  contract  be  required  it  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive bidding, and any contract costing less than the equivalent of $500,000 (other than \nminor items) will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. Direct purchase procedures \nwill be used for small or off-the-shelf items costing less than $100,000, including equipment and \nvehicles procured by the PMU. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 7.  \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n6. \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  supplied  by  (i)  the  PMU  implementation  consultants \n48. \n(approximately  400  domestic  person-months),  and  (ii)  institutional  change  consultants  (about \n145  person-months,  43  international  and  102  domestic)  recruited  by  DLS  to  support \nimplementation  of  its  action  for  institutional  change.13  A  committee  comprising  representatives \nof ADB, PKSF, and DLS will select the PMU implementation consultants, whose contracts will \nbe  administered  by  PKSF.  DLS  will  select  the  institutional  change  consultants.  The  PMU \nimplementation  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  while  the  institutional  change \nconsultants will be selected as firms. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Quality-and cost-based selection procedures will be used in recruiting the \nconsultants.  The  Government  will  undertake  advance  action  in  recruiting  the  implementation \nconsultants to facilitate the start-up of implementation. The Government has been advised that \napproval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  Project  or  to  finance  the \nrecruitment  costs.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  implementation  and  institutional \nconsultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursements \n\n49. \nTo  ensure  effective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government \nwill  establish  two  imprest  accounts  for  PKSF  and  DLS  in  the  name  of  the  Project  at  the \nBangladesh  Bank  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nand detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest \naccounts  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Payments for eligible items will be made through \nthe  accounts.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  is  applicable  for  reimbursing \neligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  under  the  imprest  accounts  for  any  individual \npayment  below  $50,000  equivalent.  All  project  expenditures  incurred  by  project  agencies \n(PKSF, DLS, LGED, and NGOs) will be submitted by PKSF and DLS to ADB for reimbursement. \n\n                                                 \n13 Danida will provide about $500,000 in addition to ADB\u2019s support for the institutional change consultants. \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n15\n\n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe PMU will submit to DLS, PKSF, and ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on \nproject  implementation.  The  PMU  will  particularly  address  progress  in  meeting  the  project \ntargets. The progress reports will have information on the physical progress of the project, the \nstatus  of  the  community  and  capacity  development  component,  the  enterprise  development \ncomponent,  the  ultrapoor  subcomponent,  and  other  project  components.  Within  3  months  of \nsubstantial physical completion of the Project, the PMU will submit to DLS, PKSF, and ADB a \nproject  completion  report  that  will  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,  cost,  project \nperformance management activities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \nPKSF  and  DLS  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate \n51. \nidentification  of  income  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  be  assigned \nsufficient  and  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  an  accountant.  An  independent  auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  annually  all  the  accounts,  SOEs,  and  revenues  related  to  the \nProject.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  SOE \nprocedure and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. \nAudited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be \nsubmitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nTo  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, a participatory project performance monitoring program is \nincluded  in ADB\u2019s  PPMS  framework,  unlike  in  the  PLDP.  PKSF  already  has  a  comprehensive \nmanagement information system that can be adapted to the project\u2019s information requirements. \nPPMS activities will be conducted periodically to assess whether the project inputs and activities \nhave  delivered  the  expected  outputs  and  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries,  and  at  a \nsustainable  cost.  The  PPMS  also  seeks  to  detect  at  an  early  stage  any  discrepancy  between \nthe plan and the execution of the Project. The PMU will ensure that initial district-level baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys are conducted, and will submit a detailed implementation \nplan for monitoring performance and for preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and \nconcurrence  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  the  PMU  will  submit  annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will be \nconducted  to  review  the  progress  of  the  Project  before  the  ADB  midterm  review.  Consultants \nwill  complete  an  impact  evaluation  study  before  the  PMU  prepares  the  project  completion \nreport,  including  an  assessment  of  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  has  strengthened  or \nweakened the participating NGOs as lending institutions. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review, to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will include a review of \nthe  performance  of  PKSF,  PMU,  DLS,  NGOs,  and  any  other  project  implementing  agencies; \nimplementation  of  the  loan  covenants;  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan;  physical \nprogress  of  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  proposed  midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate adjustments to the project design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\n\f 16\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nThe Project is justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. There is an undersupply of \n54. \ncommunity development and microfinance services in the target areas. These deficiencies will \nbe addressed by providing training and microfinance services to local communities to improve \ntheir participation in development planning and management of their enterprises. The enhanced \nhuman and social capital of the beneficiaries will be a significant outcome. Equity issues will be \naddressed  by  ensuring  that  locally  identified  community  needs  are  incorporated  in  the \ndevelopment  plans.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  through  its  expected  positive  impact  on \nhousehold incomes. As the outputs from project-financed activities will be largely determined by \na  community  demand-driven  process,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  actual  mix  and  scale  of  the \noutputs. Furthermore, it  is not possible to quantify the long-term benefits of the human capital \ndevelopment  activities  in  the  community  and  capacity  development  components.  Therefore,  a \nfull  benefit-cost  analysis  for  the  overall  project  was  considered  impractical.  The  summary \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n55. \nThe  main  project  benefits  will  be  the  incremental  production  of  eggs,  young  chickens, \nhens,  fattened  calves  and  goats,  milk,  and  milk  products.  The  incremental  output  will  be \nconsumed by the beneficiaries, or sold in local and regional markets. Average increases of at \nleast  20%  are  expected  in  the  annual  incomes  of  poor  families.  Intermediate  outputs  such  as \nimproved  day-old  chicks,  feed  ingredients,  and  hides  and  skins  will  also  be  sold  to  local \nproducers.  Livestock  services  such  as  extension  and  poultry  vaccinations  will  be  in  demand, \nparticularly  as  livestock  inputs  are  increasingly  provided  by  the  private  sector.  There  will  be  a \nsignificant increase in beneficiary nutritional levels that has not been quantified. The Project will \nalso provide environmental benefits\u2014manure produced by cattle and poultry is used as fertilizer \nand domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n56. \nInvestments to develop the livestock subsector have a direct impact on the income and \nnonincome dimensions of poverty across all income groups. This is particularly relevant to the \nsegment of the population living in absolute poverty that is categorized as hard core poor. The \ninability of the poor to access resources, both financial (microfinance, employment) and social \n(education, health, skill development, training, and capacity building), is a significant obstacle in \nthe development of their human capital, which is a key factor for sustainable poverty reduction. \nThere are 2.9 million households in the project area, and it is estimated that about 72% of them \n(2.1 million) are below the poverty line. The Project will assist 660,000 households (31% of the \npoor  households),  concentrating  its  activities  on  the  landless  and  households  with  women \nheads that are among the poorest of the poor. \n \n57. \nAccess to a regular and usable flow of financial and social resources through the Project \nwill  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  raising  the  beneficiaries\u2019  levels  of  empowerment, \nparticularly  with  regard  to  accessing  services;  (ii)  increasing  the  number  of  organized  farmer \n(female  and  male)  groups;  (iii)  increasing  the  demand  for  labor  because  of  the  availability  of \nresources  for  economic  activities;  (iv)  raising  household  incomes  through  employment \ngeneration;  (v)  enhancing  the  nutritional  status  of  households  through  the  consumption  of \nlivestock  and  dairy  products;  (vi)  increasing  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities;  and  (vii) \nencouraging  the  growth  of  environment-friendly  economic  enterprises.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n17\n\n \n58. \nDirect  and  quantifiable  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  both  primary  (poor  households, \nparticularly  those  headed  by  women)  and  secondary  (NGOs  and  other  service  providers) \nbeneficiaries. The estimated annual margin (or benefit) from a poultry key rearer enterprise, for \nexample,  is  Tk3,200  ($56).  Adoption  of  such  an  enterprise  will  have  a  significant  impact  on \nbeneficiary  incomes:  a  rise  of  20%  on  average  for  beneficiaries  in  the  very  poor,  poor,  or \nmarginal categories; and over 30% for beneficiaries in very poor households and those headed \nby  women.  In  total,  it  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  reach  at  least  250,000  households  who \nwould take loans. These households comprise over 900,000 persons in the very poor, poor, or \nmarginal categories, or about 10% of persons in farm households in the project area. Another \n50,000 beneficiaries are expected to adopt a range of more capital-intensive enterprises.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n59. \nThe Project will promote improved and easy access to skills development and capacity- \nbuilding  resources  and  services.  These  social  benefits  will  lead  to  employment  generation  for \nthe  poor,  especially  through  the  development  of  technical  skills  among  women  project \nparticipants.  Social  benefits  will  also  be  derived  through  increased  opportunities  for  education \nand health care, and improved nutritional status of families in general, and children and women \nin particular. Empowering the poor to demand and gain access to services and resources will be \na long-term benefit of the Project. The use of selection criteria that target poor areas for project \ninterventions will ensure that investments in the livestock subsector are directed to poorer areas \nof  the  northwestern  region  of  the  country.  If  during  implementation  it  becomes  apparent  that \nindigenous  people  are  a  major  potential  beneficiary  group  in  some  of  the  new  project \nsubdistricts, then need-based strategies will be developed together with a detailed plan of action \nto address their specific needs.  \n \nD. \n\nGender and Development Issues \n\n60.  Women  constitute  49.4%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area,  and  17.8%  of  the  2.9 \nmillion  households  are  headed  by  females.  The  preparatory  socioeconomic  surveys  indicate \nthat these households are often among the poorest in the project area. Over 70% of the female \npopulation is engaged in livestock rearing. Faced with the double impediments of a marginalized \nstatus in the family, community, and society, and lack of negotiating skills, women have had little \nor  no  real  participation  in  decision  making.  The  Project  will  provide  opportunities  to  address \nthese concerns by (i) creating an enabling environment for women\u2019s participation at all stages of \nproject  planning  and  implementation;  (ii)  ensuring  that  project  benefits  reach  100%  of  the \nidentified  households,  particularly  those  with  female  heads;  (iii)  generating  employment \nopportunities  for  women  by  involving  them  not  only  in  livestock  rearing  but  also  in  marketing \nproducts  and  supply  of  inputs  like  feed;  (iv)  facilitating  linkages  of  the  women  beneficiaries  to \ndifferent  support  resources  for  sustainability  of  their  livelihood;  and  (v)  facilitating  social  and \neconomic empowerment through formation of women farmer groups to gain increased access to \nresources  and  participation  in  project  activities.  Women  will  also  be  supported  to  develop \nentrepreneurship  skills  and  become  entrepreneurs  by  establishing  linkages  with  microfinance \ninstitutions,  government  agencies,  and  NGOs.  They  will  also  be  trained  to  manage  economic \nenterprises.  The  gender  specialists  in  the  NGOs  will  formulate  specific  strategies  to  address \ngender issues in the Project, including formation of small-scale joint ventures and mechanisms \nto  generate  home-based  income  activities  for  the  older  women  in  the  households.  A  gender \naction plan is in Appendix 11. \n  \n\n\f 18\n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nE. \n \n61. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  indicated  that  the  high  population \npressure  from  both  humans  and  livestock  leads  to  some  pollution  of  waterways  and  ponds.  It \nwas found that none of the surveyed households had any waste treatment system, nor had they \nany  precise  understanding  of  the  effects  of  a  degraded  environment.  The  Project  will  finance \nstall-feeding  or  tethered  systems  for  larger  animals  and  semiscavenging  systems  for  poultry. \nThe by-products from these enterprises will be recycled as crop fertilizer, or used as domestic \nfuel.  The  Project  will  promote  the  use  of  biogas  digesters  to  reduce  dependence  on  dung  for \nfuel.  The  Project  will  include  education  on  environmental  responsibilities  and  management  in \nthe NGO and farmer training programs to develop community consciousness of environmental \nissues  that  will  extend  beyond  the  life  of  the  Project.  The  design  of  markets,  slaughter  slabs, \nand  milk  treatment  stations  will  include  effective  and  environmentally  sound  waste  and  water \ndisposal systems. It is believed that the Project enterprise activities will have a minimal adverse \nimpact on the environment. The project training programs will significantly assist in developing \nbetter  environment  management  practices  in  rural  areas.  Staff  of  the  participating  NGOs  and \nthe  PMU  will  monitor  compliance  with  the  conditions  specified  in  the  project  environmental \nclearances,  with  the  periodic  assistance  of  an  environmental  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist. The summary IEE is in Appendix 12. \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\n62. \nCompared  with  the  PLDP,  the  Project\u2019s  participatory  planning  approach  will  give  the \nbeneficiaries  flexibility  in  selecting  enterprises  and  ensure  that  the  individual  makes  the  best \npossible  choice.  This  feature  will  also  allow  participants  to  move  away  from  investment  areas \nthat become unprofitable or distorted by externalities such as unfair trade practices. Favorable \nproduct  prices  are  needed  to  provide  farmers  with  the  expected  financial  benefits.  The  price \nassumptions used in the financial and economic analyses are conservative, and experience in \nthe PLDP indicates that the risk of adverse producer prices is minimal; most of the products are \nconsumed or marketed locally, with little outside competition at lower prices. Also, the growing \nconsumption  levels  of  livestock  products  in  Bangladesh  indicate  that  household  consumption \nand  local  market  demand  will  readily  dispose  of  the  Project\u2019s  incremental  output  without  a \nsignificant  adverse  impact  on  producer  prices.  The  Government  will  take  all  necessary \nmeasures to mitigate the risk of the outbreak of livestock diseases, including the increased use \nof  vaccines  supplied  by  the  private  sector,  the  presence  of  CEWs  to  vaccinate  animals,  and \nimproved DLS disease diagnostic services. In the PLDP, not all of the funds allocated for credit \nwere used, not because of a lack of demand for credit (para. 12), but because NGOs recycled \nloans  using  funds  originally  borrowed  from  PKSF,  and  beneficiaries  used  savings.  The  risk  of \nADB  loan  funds  not  being  used  in  the  Project  has  been  mitigated  because  recycling  of  credit \nand  the  use  of  PKSF  and  NGOs\u2019  own  resources  were  taken  into  account  in  designing  the \nProject, with only $7.5 million being provided through the ADB loan for credit (Table A4.2)    \n \n63. \nThe Project will promote increased private sector production and delivery of inputs in the \nlivestock  subsector.  Government  participation  in  such  activities  is  being  reduced  in  the  PLDP. \nTo  ensure  that  this  process  will  continue  and  input  subsidies  will  be  eliminated,  a  specific \nassurance has been provided in this regard (Assurances, [xi]). DLS is committed to institutional \nreform (para. 31). In addition, because private firms already supply the majority of such inputs, \nfailure to eliminate the subsidies would not pose a threat to the successful implementation of the \nProject. \n \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                          \n\n19\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n64. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nWithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, PKSF will establish a revolving fund, with \nterms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  microfinance  operations  related  to \nlivestock enterprises for poverty reduction under component 2 (a and b). \nPKSF will require each participating NGO to provide its office in the project area \nwith  (a)  adequate  staff,  including  an  area  manager  and  at  least  two  program \norganizers  (technical  and  microfinance);  and  (b)  adequate  logistic  support  to \nensure  that  the  area  office  is  able  to  support  the  participating  farmers  and \nentrepreneurs  in  their  project  investment  activities.  The  NGO  partners  will  be \nsupported to employ female extension workers, pursue gender-sensitive service \ndelivery mechanisms, and develop the capacity to address gender issues. \n(iii)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  project \nsteering  committee  jointly  chaired  by  the  secretaries  of  the  Finance  Division  of \nMOF  and  MFL;  core  members  will  include  representatives  of  the  Economics \nthe \nRelations  Division  (ERD)  of  MOF, \nImplementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  of  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning,  and  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development.  Other \nmembers  will  include  the  managing  director  of  PKSF,  the  director  general  of \nDLS, and representatives of LGED, and participating NGOs.  \n\nthe  Planning  Commission,  and \n\n(iv)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness  the  Government  will  establish  an \nimplementation coordination committee chaired by the deputy managing director \nof  PKSF  or  another  representative  of  PKSF;  core  members  will  include \nrepresentatives  of  the  ERD  and  Finance  Division  of  MOF,  the  Planning \nCommission,  and  IMED  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  DLS,  LGED,  and  MFL;  the \nLGED project coordinator; and the PMU project director. Indicative members will \ninclude representatives of participating NGOs and the PPSU. \n\n(v)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, PKSF will (a) select NGOs, satisfactory to \nADB, to deliver and  manage the microfinance activities and training activities in \nthe  enterprise  development  component;  and  (b)  with  the  NGOs  enter  into \nagreements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  document  the  flow,  accountability,  and \nrepayment  of  the  microfinance  activities,  and  implementation  of  the  training \nactivities in the enterprise development component. \nThe  Government,  through  PKSF  and  DLS,  will  ensure  that  the  requirements  of \nthe gender action plan in Appendix 11 are met during project implementation. \nPKSF  will  ensure  that  the  participating  NGOs  provide  social  development \ntraining, \nrights, \nincluding  awareness \ngovernance, health, and hygiene. \n\nraising,  group  management, \n\nlegal \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the approved  3-year and  10-year action plans \nto  transform  DLS  into  a  facilitator  and  regulator  of  sector  development,  and  a \npromoter of private sector development are implemented on schedule.   \nIf  involuntary  resettlement  and  land  or  asset  acquisition  are  required  for  market \nconstruction, a resettlement plan will be prepared. LGED will publicly disclose the \nresettlement plan that  will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nResettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  will  include  a  complete  census  and \ninventory of losses. LGED will not award any civil works contract for any livestock \n\n\f 20\n\nB. \n\n65. \n \n\n \n\nmarket  improvements  unless  a  resettlement  plan,  in  form  and  substance \nacceptable  to  ADB,  has  been  submitted  to  and  approved  by  LGED,  the  PMU, \nand  ADB.  Land  acquisition  work  including  compensation  payments  will  be \ncompleted  before  possession  of  land  and  other  assets,  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed-upon resettlement plan. \n\n(x)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMU  will  conduct  initial  baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation \nmonitoring plan to ADB for review and concurrence.

CONSULTING SERVICES \n\nA  team  of  independently  recruited  consultants  will  staff  the  project  management  unit \n1. \n(PMU) and assist the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) in implementing the Project. All \nconsultants must have extensive work experience in rural development projects in Bangladesh, \nand preferably also elsewhere. They must have previously worked in projects that have involved \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Also, the PMU consultants selected must have lived and \nworked at field level and been involved in project implementation. A team of institutional change \nconsultants  will  assist  the  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS)  to  transform  itself  into  a \nfacilitator  and  regulator  of  subsector  development.  The  consultants  will  have  worked  in  their \nrespective areas of specialization in Bangladesh, or similar areas. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Consultants \n\nThe  PMU \n\n(recruited  as \n\nimplementation  consultants \n\nindividuals)  will  provide \n2. \napproximately  400  domestic  person-months  of  consulting  services.  The  Project  will  fund  an \nindependently recruited, professional PMU that will be staffed by a team of domestic specialists, \nrecruited as individuals including (i) a rural development specialist (project director);1 (ii) training \nand  livestock  improvement  specialist;  (iii)  monitoring,  evaluation  and  management  information \nspecialist, and (iv) accountant. The PMU consultants will be selected by a committee composed \nof  representatives  of  ADB,  PKSF,  and  DLS,  and  will  have  experience  in  the  listed  disciplines, \nand be of international caliber. The PMU will be based in Rangpur in the project area at a site to \nbe  mutually  selected  by  PKSF  and  the  implementing  NGOs.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  to \nPKSF. The PMU\u2019s tasks will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe  relevant \nto \n\nEstablish  and  equip  a  project  management  office,  recruit \nadministrative  and  supporting  staff,  and  develop  operational  systems \neffectively support project implementation at field level. \nDevelop  an  implementing  coordination  mechanism  with  the  participating  NGOs \nthat will facilitate the execution of project activities and provide a forum to resolve \nimplementation constraints. \nPrepare a situation analysis format for the NGOs to record the essential baseline \ninformation in their individual operational areas. \nSupervise the performance of the NGOs and provide guidance and assistance to \nimprove their organizational structures and their project delivery systems. \nOversee the implementation of the gender action plan, environmental mitigation \nmeasures, and the participatory planning process. \nProvide, through the team\u2019s subject matter specialists, technical assistance to the \nNGOs  and  the  target  households  during  implementation  of  the  enterprise \ndevelopment component. \n\n(vii)  Develop  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  process  and  reporting \nsystem that will allow the PMU and the participating NGOs to carry out effectively \nproject  input  monitoring  and    benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  assist  the \nbeneficiaries with participatory monitoring and evaluation. \n\n                                                 \n1  A  rural  development  specialist  preferably  with  livestock  experience  is  considered  appropriate  because  of  the \nproject\u2019s  emphasis  on  community  development,  participatory  processes,  and  delivery  of  microfinance  to  the \nbeneficiaries. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  8 \n\n35 \n\n(viii)  Design  applied  research  projects  from  topics  that  have  been  identified  by  the \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nNGOs and the beneficiaries. \nSupervise and monitor the effective implementation of the Project\u2019s gender action \nplan at all levels. \nPrepare  annual  implementation  targets  and  activities  based  on  the  information \nderived  by  the  NGOs  through  their  participatory  planning  interaction  with  the \ntarget beneficiaries. \nPrepare  the  quarterly,  annual,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  midterm,  and  project \ncompletion  reports  that  will  allow  PKSF,  DLS,  and  ADB  to  accurately  assess \nproject\u2019s implementation progress, outputs, and any requirements for redesign or \nfurther development of the components. \n\n \nInstitutional Change Consultants \n\nC. \n\n3. \nIn  addition  to  the  PMU  consultants,  the  Danish  International  Development  Assistance \n(Danida) and Asian Development Bank will finance an institutional change team recruited from \nfirms to support DLS staff skills development in essential areas, as specified in the 3, 5, and 10-\nyear  action  plans  for  DLS\u2019s  future  development.  Approximately  145  person-months  will  be \nrequired:  43  international  and  102  domestic.  Indicative  specialists  will  include  international \nconsultants with expertise in (i) management of change processes, (ii) institutional development, \n(iii)  legal  issues,  (iv)  disease  monitoring  systems,  (v)  veterinary  public  health  monitoring  and \ncontrol  systems,  (vi)  livestock  sector  quality  assurance  systems,  and  (vii)  management \ninformation  systems.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  required  with  specialization \nin  (i) \nmanagement  of  change  processes  (full-time  team  leader),  (ii)  organization  development,  (iii) \nhuman  resources  development,  (iv)  livestock  information  systems,  (v)  disease  monitoring \nsystems,  (vi)  veterinary  public  health  monitoring  and  control  systems,  (vii)  livestock  sector \nquality assurance systems, and (viii) management information systems.  \n \nThe  consultants  will  assist  DLS  in  achieving  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  10-year \n4. \naction  plan  for  institutional  change.  First,  the  consultants  will  support  DLS  in  achieving  the \ndevelopment  objective  of  the  3-year  action  plan,  which  is  to  develop  a  cost-effective \norganization,  with  an  empowered  change  management  team;  a  new  organizational  structure; \ntrained, motivated, and competent staff; and all management and professional systems in place, \nwhich  can  implement  the  vision  and  mission  of  the  DLS  to  create,  promote,  and  regulate  an \nenabling  environment  for  the  subsector.  This  support  will  focus  on  achieving  the  following \noutputs in the 3-year action plan: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nan effective change management process that ensures that the proposed action \nplan  is  implemented  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  addresses  all  risks  and \nconstraints, and utilizes possible synergies and momentum created externally to \nthe subsector; \norganizational  development  leading  to  a  cost-effective  organization  that  can \nimplement the vision and mission of the DLS to create, promote, and regulate an \nenabling environment for the subsector; \nhuman  resources  development  resulting  in  a  human  resources  development \nsystem  that  enhances  the  continuous  development  of  adequately  skilled  and \nmotivated staff; \na  livestock  information  system  and  database  that  provides  easy  access  to \ninformation needed for cost-effective development of the livestock subsector for \nall stakeholders; \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\na disease monitoring system that in a cost-effective manner will reduce mortality \nand  morbidity,  and  make  livestock  development  less  risky  and  hence  more \nprofitable for rural households; \na  veterinary  public  health  monitoring  and  control  system  that  in  a  cost-effective \nmanner  reduces  diseases  transmitted  from  animals  to  humans,  and  makes \nconsumption of animal products and by-products safer for humans; \na livestock subsector quality assurance system that will ensure that private sector \ndevelopment  takes  place  in  a  regulated  manner  and  that  rural  households \nreceive quality services in an accountable and transparent manner characterized \nby competition and consumer choice; and \na  DLS  management  information  system  that  will  facilitate  the  transformation  of \nDLS into a learning institution that continuously improves its performance through \na trial-and-error institutional development process. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  9 \n\n37 \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nRationale \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Project is justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. The need for the Project \n1. \narises  from  the  undersupply  of  community  development  services  in  the  project  area  and \nunderinvestment in microfinance delivery services. These deficiencies will largely be addressed \nby providing training and support services to local people to improve their ability to access the \nresources\u2013both physical and financial\u2013required for income improvement. Enhancing the human \nand  social  capital  of  beneficiaries,  will  help  in  addressing  equity  issues  by  ensuring  that  the \nneeds  of  the  ultrapoor  are  explicitly  recognized  and  appropriate  development  alternatives \noffered to them. In addition, the Project will enhance the ability of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) to provide microfinance and support services to the beneficiaries. \n \n2. \nWhile  in  recent  years  Bangladesh  has  considerably  reduced  the  incidence  of  poverty, \nnot all poor groups, particularly those in isolated rural areas, have benefited equally. The Project \nwill go some way to addressing this deficiency.  \n \nB. \n \nWhile  the  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  poverty  reduction  in  the  broadest  sense, \n3. \nthe main measure of the success of its activities is changes in household incomes. Toward this \nend,  the  main  project  activities  proposed  are  (i)  development  of  the  capacity  of  community \nleaders,  beneficiaries,  and  providers  of  support  services;  (ii)  technical,  microfinance,  and \ninfrastructure support for both on- and off-farm activities; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of \nsupport  institutions  such  as  NGOs  and  the  Department  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS)  to  deliver \nservices. \n \nThe  analysis  that  follows  focuses  on  quantifiable  benefits  at  the  household  level  and \n4. \ndescribes nonquantifiable benefits in a qualitative manner. As the output from project-financed \nactivities will largely be determined by a demand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the likely \nmix  and  scale  of  outputs.  Furthermore,  it  has  not  been  possible  to  quantify  the  long-term \nbenefits of the human capital development activities to be undertaken as part of the community \nand capacity development components; neither has it been possible to quantify the outcome of \nthe  proposed  innovation  and  ultrapoor  activities.  Therefore,  a  full  benefit-cost  analysis  for  the \noverall project was considered impractical. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nCommunities to be targeted by the Project are in 20 districts in northwest Bangladesh, \nmainly  in  Rajshahi  division.1  The  districts  have  a  population  of  about  27  million,  including  6 \nmillion  nonurban  households.  The  target  is  approximately  660,000  families  out  the  2.9  million \nhouseholds in the rural subdistricts covered by the Project. The Project will reach about 31% of \nthe poverty-afflicted households in the subdistricts (poverty incidence is estimated at about 72% \nin  the  project  area).  The  indicative  figure  of  660,000  families  is  made  up  of  360,000  families \nfrom  districts  and  subdistricts  previously  covered  by  the  Participatory  Livestock  Development \nProject  (PLDP,  [17  districts  and  89  subdistricts])  and  300,000  families  from  new  areas  (46 \n\nBeneficiaries \n\n                                                 \n1 The districts are Bogra, Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Joypurhat, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Mymensingh, Naogaon, \nNatore,  Nawabganj,  Netrokona,  Nilphamari,  Pabna,  Panchagarh,  Rajshahi,  Rangpur,  Sherpur,  Sirajganj,  and \nThakuragaon.  \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nsubdistricts in 3 new districts, and 22 new subdistricts in the 17 PLDP districts). The families in \nthe PLDP area will mostly be families previously not included in the PLDP activities, those who \nwant to move from poultry production into other livestock enterprises, or those wanting to enter \ninto  processing  and  marketing  activities.  Therefore,  all  enterprises  will  be  new,  and  all  inputs \nand outputs will be incremental. These areas have been chosen because of their poverty and \npotential for livestock development. \n \n6. \nIn  total,  project  resources,  including  complementary  infrastructure  investments,  will \nenable between 300,000 and 320,000 households to participate, including an estimated 5,000 \nhouseholds in the ultrapoor category. Actual beneficiary numbers will be determined in part by \nthe  outcome  of  a  range  of  project-supported  activities  including  community  capacity  building, \ninfrastructure  construction,  land  and  other  asset  allocation,  and  marketing  initiatives.  A  6-year \nimplementation period is proposed. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial and Institutional Incentives for Stakeholder Participation \n\n1. \n\nLivestock Production Enterprises \n\n \n \n7. \nThe  Project  envisages  two  broad  categories  of  livestock  production  enterprises:  (i) \npoultry  including  ducks;  and  (ii)  other  livestock  including  calf  fattening,  goat  rearing,  and  milk \nproduction.  Participating  NGOs  will  offer  a  menu  of  enterprises  from  which  beneficiaries  can \nchoose. Beneficiary perceptions of the likely returns, and their ability to manage and finance the \nenterprise will be important factors in enterprise selection and in determining the eventual mix of \nenterprises. Based on the experience of the PLDP, it is likely that poultry production, following \nthe  established  key  rearer  model,  will  be  the  most  popular  enterprise.  For  most  beneficiaries, \nthis  will  be  a  new  household  enterprise,  which  will  utilize  food  scraps,  nearby  scavenging \nresources,  and  purchased  feeds.  Financial  models  were  prepared  for  eight  enterprises  to \ndetermine  the  likely  impact  of  the  eight  on  household  incomes  and  to  estimate  financing \nrequirements.  The  models  are  representative  of  the  main  livestock  production  and  support \nenterprises found in the project area. Key financial indicators for the enterprises in Table A9.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix  9 \n\n39 \n\nTable A9: Key Financial Indicators for Representative Enterprises \n\nEnterprise \n\nScale \n\nEnterprise Margina \n\nModel \n\n \n\nFinancial \n\nEconomic \n\n(Tk) \n\n(Tk) \n\n12 Layers \n\nPoultry Key Rearer \nPoultry Chick Rearer  400 Chicks/Batch \nHybrid Layer \nDuck Rearer \nBroiler Production \nPoultry Worker \nFeed Seller \nBeef Fattening \nGoat Production \nMilk Production \n\n36 Layers \n50 Ducks \n5,200 Growers/Batch \n1 Person \n1 Person \n2 Head \n2 Head \n1 Crossbred Cow \n\n3,296 \n6,952 \n7,504 \n11,132 \n19,811 \n6,375 \n18,483 \n4,027 \n1,885 \n10,009 \n\n2,256 \n3,379 \n4,691 \n6,697 \n14,433 \n4,468 \n16,348 \n2,840 \n397 \n3,922 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReturn to \nLaborb \n\nIndicative \nLoanc \n\n(Tk/person/ \nday) \n\n(Tk) \n\n90    \n58    \n82    \n61    \n155    \n80    \n103    \n134    \n26    \n77    \n\n \n\n \n\n1,838    \n13,672    \n7,572    \n1,680    \n15,491    \n2,200    \n9,297    \n7,998    \n3,103    \n20,520    \n\na  Sales  less  enterprise-specific  variable  costs;  annual  equivalent  at  full  development  of  the  enterprise, \nbefore  debt  service.

A typical poultry key rearer will start with about six chickens of an \nadapted local breed or crossbreed and six chickens of an improved breed, and will maintain this \nflock size through the purchase or rearing of replacement pullets. Beneficiaries adopting a more \nspecialized egg production model will run flocks of about 36 hybrid birds. Broiler production will \nbe based on about 5,200 broilers every 4 months. Chick rearers with about 400 chicks per batch \nwill  support  the  activities  of  the  main  poultry  production  enterprises.  Although  not  specifically \nmodeled,  there  will  be  scope  for  establishing  small  hatcheries  and  units  producing  eggs  for \nhatching.  Duck  rearers  will  handle  flocks  of  about  50  birds,  which  will  be  reared  as \nsemiscavengers.  \n \n9. \nOther Production Enterprises. Two head will be fattened in a typical beef enterprise. \nMost  beneficiaries  wishing  to  produce  goats  will  follow  a  model  in  which  does  are  kept  for  2 \nyears  before  being  sold  and  replacements  bought.  In  view  of  the  large  investment  required, \nmost  milk-producing  enterprises  are  likely  to  be  limited  to  one  crossbred  dairy  cow  although \nthere are likely to be other units that use local breeds in a more extensive model. \n \n10. \nSupport Enterprises. Support enterprises are likely to include poultry workers and feed \nsellers.  Estimated  margins  for  these  enterprises  are  also  shown  in  Table  A9.  Poultry  workers \nwill  provide  vaccination  services  and  limited  technical  advice  to  poultry  and  goat  producers. \nFeed  sellers  will  establish  village-based  businesses  to  supply  feed  to  producers.  These \nenterprises  have  been  successful  in  the  PLDP.  Egg  sellers,  who  will  collect  eggs  from  small \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n2. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\nproducers for wholesaling, will also be financed under the Project if there is a demand for this \nenterprise type. \n \n \n \n11. \nAnnual enterprise financial margins before debt service range from about Tk1,885 ($32) \nfor  goat  production  to  about  Tk19,810  ($339)  for  broiler  production  (Table  A9).  Assuming  an \naverage  household  size  of  3.65  persons,  annual  per  capita  increments  range  from  Tk516 \n($8.80)  to  Tk5,425  ($92.70).  With  the  exception  of  the  goat  production  enterprise,  returns  to \nlabor all exceed the current financial opportunity cost of labor in the project area, which ranges \nfrom  Tk40  to  Tk55  per  day  depending  on  season  and  class  of  labor.  Prices  and  conversion \nfactors used in the analysis are shown in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n12. \nEnterprise  margins  are  also  shown  in  Table  A9  in  economic  prices  using  the  domestic \nprice  numeraire,  and  with  the  value  of  household  labor  included  at  its  economic  opportunity \ncost.  All  margins  are  positive  under  these  assumptions.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) for the milk production enterprise was estimated at 8%. At this level of return, investment \nin milk production does not appear to be economically viable; however, the \u201cworld\u201d prices used \nin the analysis are exceptionally low because of highly subsidized producer prices in developed \ncountries.  For  this  reason,  countervailing  duties  and  taxes  are  imposed  on  milk  imports  to \nprotect  domestic  commercial  milk  producers.  The  EIRR  is  also  low  because  of  the  economic \ncost  of  labor,  which  is  not  valued  in  the  financial  analysis.  Milk  production  is,  however, \nfinancially attractive particularly to small-scale individual entrepreneurs, primarily because they \nare producing for highly localized markets that do not compete with imported milk (para. 21).  \n \n\n3. \n\nStakeholder Incentives to Participate \n\n13. \nThe Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) as Executing Agency has performed very \nwell  in  managing  projects  funded  by  other  development  partners,  and  in  the  PLDP.  It  has \ndemonstrated  a  high  degree  of  commitment  and  efficiency  in  achieving  project  development \nobjectives. In PLDP II, the project management unit (PMU) will be totally accountable to PKSF. \nIn essence, project implementation effectiveness will be the responsibility of PKSF, through the \nPMU, and participating NGOs. PKSF, DLS, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will select \nthe  PMU  staff  from  a  pool  of  competent,  independent  professionals  to  ensure  that  well-\nremunerated,  high  quality  individuals  with  proven  track  records  staff  the  PMU.  DLS  will  also \nprovide  specialist  technical  staff  to  the  PMU.  The  project  steering  committee,  and  the \nimplementation  coordination  committee,  which  will  be  chaired  by  PKSF,  will  ensure  effective \ncoordination among the stakeholders. DLS is committed to a 10-year action plan of institutional \nchange  to  transform  itself  into  a  facilitator  and  regulator  of  sector  development,  a  promoter  of \nprivate sector development, and a cost-effective provider of public goods services where market \nand  nonmarket  failures  exist.  The  Project  and  Danish  International  Development  Assistance \n(Danida)  will  support  DLS  in  implementing  the  initial  3-year  action  plan  for  change.  DLS \nparticipation in the Project is supported by a substantial capacity-building component, including \nconstruction of 27 subdistrict livestock development centers to assist DLS in supporting project \nactivities  at the  field  level.  The  Project  will  also  support  DLS  to  play  an  active  role  at  the  field \nlevel  in  supporting  community  extension  workers  to  deliver  services  for  basic  animal  health, \ndisease  diagnosis  and  control,  and  production  from  livestock  service  centers  operating  at  the \nunion council level. The community extension workers will be key actors in the livestock centers, \nsupported by the NGOs, and subdistrict DLS staff who will provide specialist disease diagnosis \nas required. Participating NGOs will receive microfinance from PKSF, with a sufficient margin to \ncover their administrative costs. For NGOs working in new subdistricts, the Project will provide \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  9 \n\n41 \n\nFinancing of Enterprise Development \n\ninitial  administrative  support  for  staff  salaries  and  equipment  and  vehicles.  Beneficiary \nincentives to participate in the Project are indicated in other sections of this appendix.  \n \nE. \n \n14.  Microfinance programs have substantially grown in recent years. However, coverage by \nmicrofinance NGOs in rural Bangladesh is still inadequate, reaching only 50% of the 10 million \nrural poor. NGO activities tend to be concentrated in more accessible areas close to subdistrict \nheadquarters and other urban centers. The PLDP attempted to extend microfinance coverage to \nthe poor who did not previously have access to microfinance services. The achievements of the \nPLDP  and  past  projects  demonstrate  opportunities  to  expand  further  livestock  development  to \ninclude a wider range of production and input supply enterprises. In the PLDP, by 30 June 2003, \n265,000  beneficiaries  had  borrowed  about  $36  million,  with  almost  a  100%  repayment,  to \nfinance livestock production enterprises. Some beneficiaries borrowed multiple times, indicating \nwillingness on the part of the poor to borrow funds to invest in livestock production. As NGOs \nunder  the  proposed  Project  become  more  experienced,  they  can  offer  a  more  diversified \ninvestment  program  that  would  include  beef,  dairy,  and  goat  enterprises;  small-scale  product \nprocessing  units;  and  input  supply  services.  Prospective  beneficiaries  have  shown  interest  in \ninvesting  in  such  enterprises.  The  project  design  has  taken  into  account  the  existing \nmicrofinance  resources  of  PKSF  and  participating  NGOs,  and  the  fact  that  the  PLDP \nmicrofinance  funds  will  continue  to  be  utilized  in  PLDP  II.  Accordingly,  ADB  will  provide  only \n$7.5  million  (21%)  of  the  Project\u2019s  total  estimated  microfinance  requirement  of  $35.8  million. \nPKSF will provide $15.3 million (43%) from its own resources; NGOs will provide $10.9 million \n(30%), and beneficiaries $2.1 million from their savings (6%). These financing arrangements are \nexpected to contribute to the long-term expansion of coverage and sustainability of microfinance \nactivities in the project area. \n \n15. \nEnterprise  development  will  be  financed  through  loans  to  be  provided  by  participating \nNGOs. While indicative loan amounts for each enterprise are shown in Table A9, NGOs will set \nindividual loan limits within their overall lending policies. Most loans will have a 1-year term. For \ngoat production, however, a 2-year term is envisaged with a 3-4 year term for milk production. \nInitial loans will finance fixed investments such as animal shelters and equipment, livestock, and \nsome  inputs.  Subsequent  loans  will  provide  seasonal  finance  for  livestock  and  inputs.  A  flat \ninterest rate of 15% has been assumed for the debt servicing estimates. \n \n16. \nEquity contributions of the beneficiaries will be determined by NGOs as part of their loan \nevaluation  procedures.  The  financing  plans  indicate  that  beneficiary  contributions  of  up  to \nTk1,000 may be required for some enterprises. Financing of the key rearer poultry model, which \nis  likely  to  be  the  most  widely  adopted,  should  be  feasible,  however,  with  minimal  beneficiary \nequity.  For  dairying,  the  financing  plan  indicates  that  household  equity  contributions  of  up  to \nTk15,000  may  be  required  in  total  over  the  first  3  years  of  the  enterprise.  Few  potential \nbeneficiaries are likely to be able to contribute this amount.  \n \nF. \n \n17. \nParticipatory rural appraisal data from 47 villages surveyed during the poverty and social \nanalysis study carried out as part of project preparation indicate that, in the project area, over \n80%  of  rural  households  fall  into  the  income  categories  of  very  poor,  poor  or  marginal.  These \nhouseholds  will  be  the  primary  targets  of  the  project.  Data  from  the  more  detailed  concurrent \nhousehold  survey  carried  out  during  the  study  show  that  annual  household  income  from  all \nsources reported by respondents in the three categories was Tk16,254 ($278) or about Tk4,450 \n\nImpact on Beneficiaries \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nMarkets for Project Outputs \n\n($76) per capita.1 More specifically, households in the very poor category reported incomes of \nonly  Tk10,636  ($182).  These  households,  together  with  households  headed  by  women  and \ngenerally categorized as being very poor, comprised over 25% of households surveyed during \nthe participatory rural appraisal. \n \n18. \nTable  A9  shows  the  estimated  annual  margin  for  a  poultry  key  rearer  enterprise,  for \nexample, to be Tk3,296 ($56). Adoption of such an enterprise would have a significant impact \non beneficiary incomes\u2013a rise of 20% on average for those in the very poor, poor, or marginal \ncategories  or,  more  specifically,  over  30%  for  those  in  very  poor  households  and  households \nheaded  by  women.  In  total,  the  Project  is  expected  to  reach  at  least  250,000  households, \ncomprising over 900,000 persons, in the very poor, poor, or marginal categories, or about 10% \nof persons in farm households in the project area. Up to 50,000 more beneficiaries are expected \nto adopt a range of more capital-intensive enterprises. Hybrid layers, broilers, and dairying fall \ninto this category. While these have the potential to make larger impacts on incomes, they may \nbe  beyond  the  immediate  reach  of  the  very  poor  and  poor  because  of  their  financing  and, \npossibly,  marketing  requirements.  They  are  more  likely  to  be  adopted  by  households  in  the \nupper end of the marginal/small category.  \n \nG. \n \nDuring  1995\u20132000,  consumption  of  dairy  products,  meat,  and  eggs  was  estimated  to \n19. \nhave grown at an annual average rate of 2.7%, 4.3%, and 7.7%, respectively. Nominal prices in \nretail markets all rose over a similar period. Increased consumption was largely driven by higher \ndisposable incomes, with per capita income growing by nearly 4% per year during the second \nhalf  of  the  1990s.  Income  changes  have  been  translated  into  increased  consumption  through \nhigh  income  elasticities  of  demand2  for  livestock  products.  In  addition,  an  increased  share  of \nhousehold budgets has been allocated to livestock and non-cereal products at the expense of \ncereals. If income growth can be sustained, there is no reason why consumption growth should \nnot continue at recent rates, especially given the existing low levels of per capita consumption. \nIn  addition,  localized  markets  for  livestock  products  exist  in  northwest  Bangladesh,  and  in  the \nPLDP,  surplus  production  generated  by  the  project  beneficiaries  was  readily  marketed.  The \nbeneficiaries  consumed  approximately  33%  of  the  incremental  production  to  improve  family \nnutrition levels. This trend is expected to continue in the proposed Project. \n \n20. \nOn  the  supply  side,  there  has  been  strong  growth  in  recent  years  in  large-scale \nproduction of eggs and broilers around the main urban centers. Small-scale producers, such as \nthose  to  be  financed  under  the  project,  have  so  far  been  able  to  compete  with  these  more \ncapital-intensive enterprises. Low labor costs and, in the view of many consumers, the attraction \nof  locally  produced  and  marketed  products  have  helped  in  this  regard.  As  the  scale  of \ncommercial production expands, however, and as internal transportation costs fall as roads are \nimproved, smaller producers are likely to come under increased price pressure. Furthermore, in \nsome parts of the project area, there will from time to time be competition from eggs crossing \nthe  border  from  India.  NGOs  involved  in  project  implementation  will  need  to  maintain  a \ncontinuing watch on price trends so that lending programs can be adjusted accordingly. \n \n21. \nThe national and local dairy industry should be monitored closely. Milk powder and other \ndairy product imports are currently highly protected, with duties and taxes adding about 90% to \nborder prices. Any reduction in this level of protection would depress local procurement prices. \n\n                                                 \n1 Average household size of those surveyed in the project area was 3.65 persons.  \n2 These have been estimated as 1.35 for milk, 1.23 for meat, and 2.00 for eggs. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  9 \n\n43 \n\nThe extent to which prices fall would depend, in part, however, on changes in world prices for \ndairy products that could result from broader trade liberalization. Lending for dairy development \nwill  need  to  reflect  the  reality  that  protection  levels  may  be  reduced  as  part  of  an  ongoing \nprogram  of  trade  policy  reform.  Nonetheless,  the  Bangladesh  Milk  Producer\u2019s  Cooperative \nUnion  (Milk  Vita)  is  active  in  the  proposed  project  area  and  provides  small  producers  with \nregular, guaranteed market access to a localized market not affected by commercial production \nand imports. The project interventions to promote milk chilling and processing will also expand \nthe available outlets demanding milk. Therefore, it is expected that smallholder farmers will be \nable  to  sell  their  surplus  milk  production  in  local  markets,  in  addition  to  increasing  family  milk \nconsumption. \n \nH. \n\nNonquantified Benefits \n\n22. \nThe Project will generate a range of nonquantified benefits. Community capacity-building \ninitiatives are expected to improve the overall development capacity of communities and assist \nwith  forming  groups  to  support  livestock  development.  The  increased  number  of  NGO \nmicrofinance offices to be financed under the Project will, in the long term, facilitate access to \nmicrofinance for a large number of people who would not otherwise be able to borrow. Training \nfor NGO and DLS staff will have a continuing benefit beyond the life of the Project. Initiatives to \nassist the ultrapoor are also likely to have long-term benefits through reduced health care costs, \nimproved  education  levels,  and  reduced  dependency.  A  significant  increase  in  beneficiary \nnutritional levels has not been quantified. The Project will also have environmental benefits such \nas manure from cattle and poultry, which is used as fertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nI. \n \n23. \nUnder the action plan to commercialize input supplies, DLS will phase out the remaining \nsubsidies  on  livestock  products  produced  by  DLS  to  achieve  deregulated  prices  by  30  June \n2005, and will provide advisory support to participating NGOs. Otherwise, the recurrent budget \nimplications of the Project for government are minimal. \n\nSubsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector  Identified  as  a  National  Priority  in  Country \nPoverty Analysis                             Yes \n\nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in  Country \nPoverty Partnership Agreement   Yes \n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n  \nAlthough gains in reducing poverty, have been achieved over the years close to half the population still live \nbelow  the  poverty  line.  In  2000,  49.8%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  was  below  the  upper  poverty  line, \ncompared  with  58.8%  in  1991/92.  In  2000,  the  head  count  rate  (upper  poverty  line)  for  the  urban  poor \ndeclined to 36.6%. Over the same period, rural poverty dropped to 53% from 61.2%. The differences in the \nnature of poverty between the various categories of poor (taking into account the needs of the ultrapoor) \nhave so far not received adequate attention in government programs. Blanket targeting of social policies for \nthe poor has been coupled with insufficient recognition of the need to develop all groups and categories of \nthe  poor  as  the  basis  for  sustainable  rural  development.  Furthermore,  the  country  is  regularly  subject  to \nflooding, which causes large-scale damage to crops, livestock, and infrastructure, with riverbank erosion as \na major factor contributing to rural poverty.  \n \nRecognition  by  the  government  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  of  small-scale  livestock \nproduction  as  a  vehicle  for  augmenting  cash  income  and  improving  household  welfare  in  poor  rural \ncommunities  has  gained  impetus  in  recent  years.  The  poor,  especially  women  (more  specifically  the \ndisadvantaged such as female\u2013heads of households, widows, and abandoned women), ethnic, and other \nminority  groups  can  be  readily  targeted  through  livestock-based  programs  to  increase  their  income  and \nimprove family nutrition. \n \nIdentifying the subsector as a national priority in the Asian Development Bank country poverty analysis and \nthe resulting partnership agreement on poverty reduction are the first steps toward the implementation of \nbetter  balanced  projects  specifically  focusing  on  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  Project  itself  will  be \ninstrumental in contributing significantly to poverty reduction in the selected districts and subdistricts. The \nProject  will  also  contribute  to  community  development,  improvements  in  the  delivery  systems  to \nparticipants, and environmental improvement. \n\n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                  Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n\nTo  prepare  a  detailed  and  multidimensional  project,  poverty  analysis  will  be  required.  The  household \nincome and expenditure survey of 2002 does not contain detailed district-level data. Hence, the Project will \ncollect  in-depth  socioeconomic  and  poverty-related  data  for  each  of  the  proposed  districts  and  present \nthem  in  a  baseline  report  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project.  The  data  will  include  income  and  expenditure, \ndemographic trends, gender issues, issues of ethnic and minority groups, nutritional status of the proposed \ntarget  population,  child  labor,  and  the  environment  in  each  district.  Detailed  analysis  of  the  dynamics  of \npoverty at economic (income) and noneconomic (non-income) levels will be conducted. At the same time \nthe  causes  (real  and  perceived),  manifestations,  and  outcomes  of  poverty  will  be  identified  and  will \ninfluence project implementation.  \n \nIdentifying  stakeholders  and  confirming  the  suitability  of  selected  project  areas  will  involve  rapid  rural \nappraisal  and  participatory  rapid  assessment  techniques  such  as  poverty  profiles,  combined  with \nparticipatory  planning  strategies  and  methodologies.  Detailed  poverty  and  social  analysis  will  identify \nconstraints  and  barriers  affecting  women  and  the  poor.  There  is  a  need  to  focus  on  the  development  of \nsustainable, cost-effective, and socially supported delivery systems with appropriate targeting and eligibility \ncriteria and a clear mandate for transparency and effective monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  use  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  baseline  surveys  in  analyzing  the  poverty \nimplications of work programs and will monitor progress through two other (midproject and end-of-project) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  10 \n\n45 \n\ndistrict-wide surveys. Participating NGOs will obtain baseline information on beneficiaries and monitor their \nprogress  in  terms  of  asset  creation,  family  incomes,  and  nutrition.  The  progress  of  farmer-level \norganizations  as  a  means  of  social  mobilization  and  interaction  with  the  lower  levels  of  government \nadministration will also be monitored. \n \nIdentifying  constraints  and  barriers  (both  internal  and  external)  and  possible  feasible  positive  actions  for \nmaximizing project objectives will be given significant consideration. \n \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nThe Project will use a highly participatory process. It will conduct initial field consultations using rapid rural \nappraisal and participatory rapid assessment techniques to conduct baseline surveys and gender analyses, \nidentify key beneficiary groups and stakeholders, and initiate social mobilization.   \n \nCommunity mobilization activities will use participatory approaches involving all relevant stakeholders. The \nparticipants  will  include  the  disadvantaged  (ethnic  and  minority  groups)  and  women  to  identify  the  most \nappropriate  project  services  and  make  them  available.  Project  activities  are  intended  to  be  needs  based \nand community supported. \n \nThe Project will identify the need for and special approaches required for the full participation of women and \nmarginalized people, including the ultrapoor, minority, and indigenous people. These groups will participate \nin assessing the degree of poverty among women and men; identifying ways to reduce their poverty; and \nexamining issues in the livestock subsector including the need for training, marketing, and other linkages \nand services. Macrolevel issues will also be identified through consultation with all categories and levels of \nstakeholders.  \n \nNGOs  will  participate  as  key  stakeholders  in  delivering  services  at  the  field  level  and  ensuring  a \nparticipatory  process  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project.  A  participatory  operational  mechanism  will  be \ndeveloped to involve all categories of stakeholders (project beneficiaries, participating NGOs, government \nline  agencies,  local  administrations,  and  development  partners)  in  implementing  and  monitoring,  and  to \nkeep them informed of project achievements, innovations, and issues.  \n \nBeneficiary  groups  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  group  activities  that,  as  they  consolidate  their \nactivities, would grow into associations that undertake a wider role of developing input-output linkages and \nresolve larger community-based issues. Their representation on community coordination committees will be \nsought as a means of obtaining feedback on project activities. Committees comprising participating NGOs \nand cooperating line agencies would meet regularly with project staff to identify and resolve implementation \nissues, and achievements and innovations that can be replicated periodically at the subdistrict level.  The \nimplementing  agency  will  carry  out  periodic  reviews  with  the  NGO  partners.  Special  working  groups  will \nwork  with  project  staff  on  key  issues.  Such  events  will  be  designed  to  ensure  a  sense  of  ownership  and \nsustainability  of  the  Project,  and  monitor  milestones  in  project  progress.  Through  information  sharing, \nconsultation, shared decision making, and shared responsibility and control of project implementation, the \nroles and functions of the stakeholders will be identified and strengthened.  \n\nD. \n\nGender Development \n\n \n\nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women: \n \nThe overall objective of the Project is poverty reduction, and it will specifically address the gender aspects \nof  poverty  among  the  rural  population.  It  will  seek  to  improve  the  living  standards  of  the  population, \nespecially of women and households headed by women with a view to significantly reduce gender disparity \nin in economic activities. \n\n \nTo maximize the impact on women, baseline studies will identify specific needs of women, strategies, and \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nmechanisms for addressing such needs in the operation of each project component and their monitoring. \nWomen  will  form  the  majority  of  the  beneficiaries  for  enterprise  development  and  will  be  supported  with \nmicrofinance, adequate training, and  marketing linkages. The NGO partners will ensure empowerment of \nwomen by organizing them in groups, creating opportunities for income generation and asset development, \ndeveloping  leadership  skills,  familiarizing  them  with  their  rights,  and  creating  awareness  of  their  social \nresponsibilities. Women from among the ultrapoor group will be supported to undertake asset development \nactivities.  Special  activities  will  be  initiated  to  develop  entrepreneurial  traits,  management  skills,  and \nlivestock-related simple technical knowledge among women.  \n \nThe  NGOs  will  recruit  women  as  agents  to  ensure  that  they  are  involved  and  participate  at  all  levels  of \nproject  implementation.  Women  will  also  be  developed  as  livestock  service  providers  at  the  community \nlevel. The services of a gender specialist will be sought to ensure that gender concerns are addressed in \nimplementing all the project components.    \n\n \n\nOutput Prepared:  \n                                                                                                                                  \nA  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  to  systematically  deliver  project  benefits  to  women  in  line  with  the \ncountry\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development  and  the  national  priority  of  poverty  reduction  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nIssues \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nUncertain/None \n\nResettlement \nAffordability \n\nNone \nNonsignificant  \n\nNone \nNone \n\nNot applicable \nRural people lack access to \nproductive resources, both \nfinancial and social.

These \nfactors, coupled with the \nincidence of cross border \nsmuggling of cattle and \neggs, could have \nsignificant impacts on the \nProject. \n\nCoordination among concerned \nagencies needs to be ensured \nto meet project deadlines. \n \nEfforts toward institutional \ncapacity building for \nadministratively weak units \nneed to be an inherent part of \nthe Project to reduce \npossibilities of failure. \n \nMonitoring and supervision \nneed to be stringent and \ncontinuous. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n\n1. \nThe proposed Project will implement a time-bound gender action plan and will address \ngender  concerns  in  all  four  project  components.  The  main  activities  will  relate  to  enhancing \nwomen\u2019s capacity to increase their involvement and incomes in the livestock sector so that the \nProject can contribute in achieving the Government\u2019s and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s goal of \npoverty reduction.  \n \n2. \n\nTo realize this long-term goal, the proposed Project will : \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\nensure  that  the  Project  addresses  the  gender  aspects  of  poverty  reduction \nthrough \nlivestock \nthe  project  components:  community  development, \nenterprise  development,  pilot  program  for  the  ultrapoor,  innovative  and \napplied research, institutional capacity building of the implementing agencies, \nand monitoring; \ncreate  an  enabling  environment  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  livestock \nsector  and  support  the  government  in  addressing  gender  concerns  of  the \nsector while working for poverty reduction; \ngive  women  access  to  resources  and  inputs  (microfinance,  information  and \ntraining,  livestock  support  services  such  as  veterinary  services  and  artificial \ninsemination  services),  and  enhance  their  income  and  capacity  to  utilize \nincreased resources effectively and efficiently; and \nenhance women\u2019s capability to access markets and available resources for a \nsustainable livelihood. \n\nThe Project will explicitly undertake the following measures to address gender issues. \n\n \n3. \n \nComponent \nCommunity \nDevelopment \n\nActivity and Target \n\nbe for women. \n\n(i)  660,000 poor landless families will be reached.  \n(ii)  Women will be formed into separate groups and at least 70% of groups will \n\n(iii)  Women  groups  will  be  targeted  for  leadership  development,  legal \nawareness, group solidarity, and identification and accessing of community \nresources. \n\n(iv)  Meetings and training sessions for the female groups will be arranged at a \n\n(v)    Female  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  staff  will  be  recruited  and \n\ntime and venue suitable for women. \n\ntrained to provide extension services.  \n\n(vi)  Gender awareness will be created amongst the target group population. \n(vii)  Women  will  be  assisted  to  participate  fully  and  benefit  equitably  in  the \n\ndevelopment processes. \n\n(viii) Community extension workers (70% women) will be trained to vaccinate \n\nanimals and provide livestock extension services. \n\n(ix)  Pro-poor and women-friendly extension methodologies will be developed \n\nand implemented. \n\n\f \n\nComponent \nLivestock \nEnterprise \nDevelopment \n\nActivity and Target \n(i) \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nDLS  Capacity \nBuilding \n\nProject Services \n\n(i) \n\n(viii)  Women will be oriented on asset creation, availability of social assets, and \n\nlivestock  and \n\nleast  50%  of \n\ntraining  participants  (in  enterprise, \n\nAt \nmanagement capacity, and skills development) will be women.    \nGender-sensitive  schedules  will  be  formulated  and  implemented  to \nfacilitate women\u2019s participation in training. \nWomen  will  receive  at  least  50%  of  the  300,000  microfinance  packages \nand at least 50% of the microfinance portfolio. \nWomen  will  be  trained  on  enterprise  management  and  technology \nassociated with operating the enterprise. \nMarketing  information  and  marketing  linkage  support  will  be  provided  to \nwomen entrepreneurs to cater to their specific needs. \nConsumer awareness program on meat hygiene will include women.  \nThe  5,000  beneficiaries  of  this  component  will  be  women  from  the \nultrapoor or households with female heads. \n\nhealth. \nWomen  will  be  provided  with  microfinance  and  related  training  for \noperating an income-generating activity. \nA flexible savings program for women will be introduced. \nA  disaster  management  fund  will  be  developed  as  a  social  safety  net  for \nultrapoor families. \nDepartment  of  Livestock  Services  (DLS)  staff  will  be  trained  to  become \nfacilitators  for  change.  The  training  will  include  their  role  as  facilitator  for \npromotion of gender equity in the livestock sector. DLS female staff will be \ntargeted for participation in the training.  \nThe  action plan  developed  by  DLS  for  its  institutional  change  will include \nattention to gender issues in the livestock subsector.  \nNGOs with activities for gender equity and gender equity in staffing will be \nselected. \nNGOs  will  be  supported  to  open  new  area  offices  with  staff  and  logistics \nand maintain a women-friendly environment.  \nThe NGO partners will be supported to employ female extension workers, \npursue  gender-sensitive  service  delivery  mechanism,  and  develop \ncapacity  for  addressing  gender.

Information  gathered  during  field  visits  and  stakeholder  consultations,  and \nfrom a review of reports pertinent to the Project formed the basis for the SIEE. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  carry  out  development  activities  in  20  districts  in  northwestern \nBangladesh.  It  will  (i)  improve  community  capabilities  to  develop  and  manage  income- \ngenerating  activities  through  a  technical  and  social  development  training  program,  (ii)  provide \nmicrofinance and technical supporting services for rural enterprise development, (iii) assist the \nultrapoor  through  a  pilot  program  of  asset  development  and  training,  (iv)  build  the  capacity  of \nthe  Department  of  Livestock  Services,  and    (v)  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing  and \nmanagement  agencies.  The  total  project  area  will  cover  157  subdistricts  in  20  districts;  68  of \nthese  subdistricts  and  3  districts  are  areas  that  have  not  received  assistance  under  the \nParticipatory Livestock Development Project.1 \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n3. \nWater  Resources.  Flowing  rivers  and  standing  water  bodies  constitute  the  surface \nwater  resources  of  the  project  area.  The  rivers  and  tributaries  cover  about  14%  of  the  project \narea. Water pollution problems are not apparent. \n\n4. \nEcological  and  Cultural  Resources.  The  project  area  had  rich  flora  in  the  past.  But \nwith  the  passage  of  time,  much  of  the  forest  has  disappeared  as  a  result  of  the  expansion  of \nagriculture  and  human  settlements.  The  project  districts  are  fairly  wooded  and  many  valuable \nforest trees are indigenous. The trees are used as timber and fuelwood. Clumps of bamboo are \nvery common and are found in every homestead forest. A large variety of medicinal plants are \nalso present.  \n \n5. \nLarge  mammals  like  tigers,  elephants,  gangetic  dolphins,  and  wild  boars  were  widely \ndistributed  in  the  past,  but  have  almost  completely  disappeared.  Other  mammals  like  jackals, \nfoxes, large Indian civets, otters, Bengal mongooses, and squirrels still occur, but their numbers \nare rapidly dwindling. Almost all varieties of birds found in Bangladesh are also common in the \nproject area.  \n \nThere are places of aesthetic, historical, religious, cultural, and archeological value in the \n6. \nproject  area.  Like  the  natural  forest  and  watersheds,  they  are  protected  under  the \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act.  There  are  no  environmentally  sensitive  areas  in  the  project \ndistricts.     \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1997.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environment Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n7. \nA  masterscreening  checklist  drawn  up  for  agricultural  projects  in  Bangladesh  identified \nsignificant  impacts  (both  positive  and  negative)  and  eliminated  insignificant  ones.  An  impact \nmatrix  was  constructed  using  the  checklist  and  is  included  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  A \nchecklist  identifying  significant  potential  project  impacts  was  produced.  Of  all  the  project \ncomponents,  only  the  enterprise  development  component  has  potential  impacts.  The  impacts \nare outlined in paras. 8\u201311, with the appropriate mitigation and enhancement measures. \n \n8. \nManagement  of  Polluting  Wastes.  Wastes  from  farm  activitities  using  veterinary \nvaccines and medicines, and chemical fertilizers are likely to create some pollution problem in \nthe  natural  environment,  including  water,  soil,  and  ambient  air  around  the  farms.  Residual \nchemicals  from  vaccines  and  medicines  can  possibly  accumulate  and  ultimately  affect  human \nas  well  as  animal  health  by  entering  into  the  food  chain.  Training  beneficiaries  on  careful \nhandling of polluting wastes can mitigate this potentially adverse impact.  \n\n \nTreatment of Organic Wastes. All solid and liquid wastes generated on farms , contain \n9. \norganic pollutants. These are likely to be converted into organic fertilizer products, or neutralized \nby  natural  processes.  The  effluents  either  may  create  dissolved  oxygen  deficiency  in  water \nbodies and affect aquatic lives particularly fish, or may contaminate the soil. The best option for \nmitigating organic pollution is to construct biogas plants and use both solid and liquid wastes as \nraw  material  for  producing  energy  in  the  form  of  biogas.  However,  this  option  is  economically \nfeasible  only  for  farms  with  more  than  250  chickens,  or  10  cattle.  Alternatively,  the  generated \nsolid  wastes  can  be  used  in  preparing  compost  for  use  as  organic  fertilizer,  and  the  effluents \ncan  be  neutralized  through  lagoon  treatment  in  earthen  ponds.  Farmers  generally  use  solid \nwastes  as  cooking  fuel;  however,  they  are  generally  less  familiar  with  composting techniques. \nImplementation  of  a  program  for  making  compost  will  require  some  technical  training  and \nassistance from either an experienced nongovernment organization (NGO) or the Department of \nAgriculture. \n \n10. \nBesides mitigating the impacts arising from organic waste disposal from existing farms, \nthe  marketing  and  small  business  development  subcomponent  of  the  Project  will  promote  the \nconstruction  of  chilling,  pasteurizing  and  packaging  units,  and  slaughter  slabs  in  livestock-\nowning  communities.  The  design  of  markets,  slaughter  slabs,  and  milk  treatment  stations  will \ninclude effective and environmentally sound waste and water disposal systems. Wastes (such \nas blood and intestinal contents) generated from slaughterhouses should produce no noticeable \nnegative  impact  on  the  environment,  or  health;  rather  the  impact  is  expected  to  be  positive. \nFishermen collect blood as fish feed, and the poor use intestinal contents as fuel and fertilizer.      \n\n \n\n11. \nIncreased  Forage  and  Fodder  Production  and  Soil  Conditioning.  Increased  forage \nproduction  and  establishment  of  leguminous  fodder  trees  in  farm  areas,  along  roadsides,  and \nfodder production pockets will help increase soil nitrogen and improve soil fertility and organic \nmatter. This impact is positive; hence no mitigation will be required. \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n12. \nNational  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  in  Bangladesh  are  outlined  in  the \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Act  of  1995  and  the  Environmental  Conservation  Rules  of  1997. \nNecessary  environmental  clearances  will  be  obtained  from  the  Department  of  Environment, \nwhich is the national environmental technical and regulatory agency. The conditions laid down \nin the clearances including compliance with national environmental quality standards will have \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nto  be  fulfilled.  Also,  coordination  with  the  department  will  be  maintained  during  project \nimplementation.  Staff  of  the  participating  NGOs  and  the  project  management  unit  will  monitor \ncompliance  with  the  conditions  specified  in  the  clearances,  with  the  periodic  assistance  of  an \nenvironmental monitoring and evaluation specialist. \n \n13. \nThe  field  survey  for  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  clearly  indicated  that \nfarmers (i) are not familiar with the country\u2019s environmental policy and legislation; (ii) have poor \nknowledge  regarding  the  safe  handling  and  health  effects  of  veterinary  medicines;  (iii)  do  not \nhave adequate knowledge of preparing cattle and poultry feeds using local raw materials; and \n(iv)  manage  farm-generated  solid  and  liquid  wastes  unproductively,  when  they  have  the \npotential  to  produce  energy  and  soil  nutrients.  To  assist  the  farmers  to  produce  and  sustain \nlivestock of high economic potential, farmer training is needed on these topics: (i) environmental \npolicy  and  legislation  in  Bangladesh,  (ii)  the  safe  handling  and  disposal  of  used  vaccines  and \nmedicines,  and  (iii)  preparing  poultry  and  cattle  feed.  Project  and  NGO  staff  will  be  given \ntraining-of-trainer  courses  on  environmental  awareness \nfarmer  awareness  of \nenvironmental  issues,  before  delivering  such  courses  to  the  farmers.  NGOs  will  also  offer \nspecific courses for project beneficiaries. \n \n14. \nThe  environmental  impact  analysis  shows  that  none  of  the  environmental  components \nhave a high negative impact caused by the project interventions. Since there are few adverse \nimpacts,  an  extensive  monitoring  program  is  not  required.  However,  the  project  management \nunit  with  the  assistance  of  an  impact  assessment  specialist  as  part  of  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental  monitoring  program  periodically  checks  and  monitor  water  quality  and  other \nimpact issues. \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nto  raise \n\n15. \nThe  important  environmental  impact  issues  arising  from  the  field  investigations  and \nstakeholder  consultations  include  the  following:  (i)  negative  impacts  due  to  unproductive \nmanagement of livestock-generated wastes were common on all farms; (ii) no farms had waste \ntreatment  facilities;  (iii) generated  solid  wastes are  deposited  in  earthen  ditches  and,  concrete \ncontainers,  or  heaped  in  the  open,  while  liquid  wastes  are  drained  into  closed  water  bodies, \nreleased  into  streams,  or  poured  on  the    ground;  (iv)  all  surveyed  farms  are  using  veterinary \nvaccines  and  medicines;  (v)  residues  from  these  farms  are  likely  to  produce  no  noticeable \nimpact on the environment; and (vi) none of the surveyed farmers have any knowledge about \nthe country\u2019s environmental  policies and legislation. \n \n16. \nIn  the  light  of  the  findings,  several  recommendations  can  be  made.  Farmers  need \ntraining  and  motivation  to  use  farm-generated  wastes  to  produce  biogas.  NGO  staff,  in \ncooperation  with  local  NGOs  and  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  must  train  farmers  on  the \nlagoon  treatment  for  generated  effluents,  and  compost  preparation  using  solid  and  semisolid \nwastes.  Farmers  require  awareness  training  to  comply  with  the  Department  of  Environment \nrules  and  regulations  on  farm  activities  and  waste  disposal.  Farmers  will  also  benefit  from \ntraining on the safe handling and health effects of veterinary vaccines and medicines, and the \nsafe  preparation  of  poultry  and  cattle  feed  and  preservation  techniques.  Training  the \nimplementing agency and NGO staff as trainers to regularly conduct community environmental \nawareness orientation will be useful. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53 \n\nG. \n\nConclusions  \n\n17. \nThe  IEE  did  not  find  any  irreversible  adverse  environmental  impact  caused  by \nimplementing  the  Project.  No  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  However,  the \nchilling, pasteurizing, and packaging units\u2014for which credit will be provided under the marketing \nand  small  business  development  subcomponent\u2014will  have  to  conform  to  the  environmental \nclearance  certificate  issued  to  the  Project.  The  Project  can  be  made  sustainable  by \nimplementing the specified resource management training and monitoring programs. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 19 November 2003) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nTk1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.0172 \nTk58.2 \n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, a rate of $1.00 to Tk58 has been used. \n  \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", "ADB \nCEW \nDanida \nDLS \nEIRR \nERD \nIEE \nIFAD \nIMED \nLGED \nMFL \nMOF \nNGO \nPKSF \nPLDP \nPMU \nPPMS \nPPSU \nSOE \n", "enterprise \n \n \n \n \nfarmer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncommunity extension worker \nDanish International Development Assistance  \nDepartment of Livestock Services \neconomic internal rate of return \nEconomic Relations Division \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division \nLocal Government Engineering Department \nMinistry of Fisheries and Livestock \nMinistry of Finance \nnongovernment organization \nPalli Karma-Sahayak Foundation  \nParticipatory Livestock Development Project \nproject management unit \nproject performance management system \nPolicy and Planning Support Unit \nstatement of expenditure \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n", "\u201centerprise\u201d  in  this  report  refers  to  any  activity  in  which  a \nbeneficiary  might \ninvest,  such  as  a  poultry  production \nenterprise, broiler production enterprise, dairy cattle enterprise, \nor milk processing enterprise. \n \nIn  this  report,  \u201cfarmer\u201d  includes  all  potential  beneficiaries  that \nwill  engage  in  livestock  production,  including  the  landless  and \nbeneficiaries with small landholdings. \n", "NOTES \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  30  June.
