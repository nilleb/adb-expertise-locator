An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nAssessment  and the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  seek  to  (i)  improve  community  capabilities  to \ndevelop  and  manage  income-generating  activities  through  a \ntechnical and social development training program; (ii) provide \nmicrofinance  and  technical  supporting  services  for  livestock \nenterprise  development,  including  assistance  to  the  ultrapoor \nthrough a pilot program of asset development and training; (iii) \nbuild the capacity of the Department of Livestock Services (DLS); \nand  (iv)  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing  and  management \nagencies. The total project area will cover 157 subdistricts in 20 \ndistricts; 68 of these subdistricts and 3 districts will be areas that \nhave  not  received  assistance  under  the  previous  Participatory \nLivestock Development Project.  \n   \nRationale  The  continued  development  of  viable  small  farmer  and  small \nbusiness  livestock  enterprises  is  an  essential  prerequisite  to \npoverty reduction in the rural areas. In recent years innovative \ndevelopments in the livestock subsector have played an important \nrole  in  increasing  cash  incomes,  improving  food  quality  and \nquantity, and creating employment for the rural poor. Livestock \nenterprise  development  programs  have  been  particularly \nsuccessful  in  reaching  poor  and  destitute  women.  The \naccompanying  microfinance  and  supporting  technical  services \ndelivered through groups have provided poor households with the \nknowledge  and  confidence  to  expand  and  diversify  their \ndevelopment enterprises. \n \nObjectives  The goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty in 20 districts of \nnorthwest  Bangladesh.  To  achieve  the  goal,  the  Project  will \nincrease  income-generating  activities  and  employment  from \nlivestock-related  enterprises  for  the  rural  poor,  particularly \nlandless  households  and  households  headed  by  women.  The \nProject  will  build  the  individual  and  community  capability  to \nmanage production enterprises; it will provide microfinance for a \nrange  of  income-generating  activities  including  livestock \nenterprises, small businesses, and marketing initiatives; and it will \nsupport the development of livestock input supply services and \nemployment opportunities in the private sector. The Project will \nspecifically target the ultrapoor to support their asset development \nand  social  mobilization.  DLS  capacity  building  will  also  be \nsupported. \n ", "iv   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.8  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $5.0 million, and local currency of \n$50.8  million  equivalent.

PKSF, as Executing Agency for components 1a, \npart of 2a, 2b, and 4 will coordinate the project activities through \nthe projects division in its Dhaka office. It will establish a field-level \nproject management unit (PMU) based in Rangpur, staffed by \nindependently recruited subject matter specialists and headed by \na project director to supervise all project activities. A working level \nimplementation  coordination  committee  will  be  established  to \nguide the PMU on a more regular basis. A group of established \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) with operational networks \nin the project area will implement the community development \ncomponent  and  the  microfinanced  activities  in  the  livestock \nenterprise development component. DLS will be the Executing \nAgency for specialist technical training and provision of technical \nservices  as  required,  in  addition  to  DLS  capacity  building. \nConstruction  of  local  markets  and  slaughter  slabs  will  be \nimplemented through the Local Government Engineering Department. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Items  such  as  equipment  and  vehicles  will  be \nprocured through direct purchase. Civil works will comprise many \nsmall contract packages for improving infrastructure and facilities \nscattered over a large area. All civil works will be procured from \nprequalified  local  contractors  through  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A  team  of  consultants  will  support  project  implementation  and \nassist PKSF in executing the Project. A committee comprising \nrepresentatives  of  ADB,  PKSF,  and  DLS  will  select  the  PMU \nimplementation  consultants.  DLS  will  select  the  institutional \nchange consultants. The PMU implementation consultants will be \nselected as individuals while the institutional change consultants \nwill be selected from firms. All consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. Quality and cost-based selection procedures will be \nused in recruiting the consultants. ADB approved advance action \nfor Government recruitment of consultants. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  The main project benefits will be the incremental production of \nBeneficiaries  eggs, young chickens, hens, fattened calves and goats, milk, and \nmilk products. The incremental output will be consumed by the \nbeneficiaries, or sold in local and regional markets, with expected \naverage increases of at least 20% in the annual incomes of poor \nfamilies. Intermediate outputs such as improved day old chicks, \nfeed ingredients, and hides and skins will also be sold to local \nproducers.  Livestock  services  such  as  extension  and  poultry \nvaccinations  will  also  rise,  particularly  as  the  private  sector \nincreasingly provides livestock inputs. The Project will also have \nenvironmental benefits\u2014manure produced by cattle and poultry \nwill be used as fertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. ", "vi   \n  There  are  2.9  million  households  in  the  project  area.  It  is \nestimated that the members of about 72% of these households \n(2.1 million) live below the poverty line. The Project will assist \n660,000 households (31% of the poor households), concentrating \nthe activities on the landless and households headed by women \nthat  are  among  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  Of  the  660,000 \nhouseholds to receive training through the Project, it is expected \nthat  at  least  250,000  households,  comprising  over  900,000 \npersons in the very poor, poor, or marginal categories will take \nloans. Another 50,000 beneficiaries are expected to adopt a range \nof  more  capital-intensive  enterprises.  Access  to  a  regular  and \nusable flow of financial and social resources through the Project \nwill  contribute  towards  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  increasing \nbeneficiaries\u2019 levels of empowerment, particularly with regard to \naccessing services; (ii) increasing the number of organized farmer \n(female and male) groups; (iii) increasing the demand for labor \nbecause of the availability of resources for economic activities; (iv) \nincreasing household incomes through employment generation; \n(v)  improving  the  nutritional  status  of  households  through \nconsumption  of  livestock  and  dairy  products;  (vi)  increasing \nwomen\u2019s  employment;  and  (vii)  encouraging  the  growth  of \nenvironment-friendly economic enterprises.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been designed to manage and mitigate risks. The \nProject\u2019s participatory planning approach will give the participating \nbeneficiaries flexibility in selecting enterprises and will ensure that \nthe  individual  makes  the  best  possible  choice.  Past  project \nexperience indicates that the risk of adverse producer prices is \nminimal, since most of the products are consumed or marketed \nlocally, with little outside competition at lower prices. Also, the low \n(but  growing)  consumption  levels  of  livestock  products  in \nBangladesh also indicate that household consumption and local \nmarket demand will readily dispose of the Project\u2019s incremental \noutput without a significant adverse impact on producer prices. \nThe Government will take all necessary measures to mitigate the \nrisk of the outbreak of livestock diseases, including the increased \nuse  of  vaccines  supplied  by  the  private  sector,  availability  of \ncommunity extension workers to vaccinate animals, and improved \nDLS disease diagnostic services.  The risk of ADB loan funds not \nbeing used in the Project has been mitigated because recycling of \ncredit and the use of PKSF and NGOs\u2019 own resources were taken \ninto account in designing the Project. \n ", "                                                                                         v  i i                              ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Participatory Livestock Development \nProject.1 \n \nII.        RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n \n2.  Livestock and related enterprises and services play a prominent role in the economy of \nBangladesh and involve large numbers of rural households. The livestock subsector is labor \nintensive and its activities are evenly spread throughout the country, with an estimated 85% of \nall rural households owning some animals or poultry. The subsector contributes about 3% to the \ngross  domestic  product  and  provides  full-time  employment  for  about  20%  of  the  rural \npopulation. Over the last decade, changes in the livestock population have reflected the decline \nin grazing land area because of urban expansion, and the increased market opportunities in \nurban areas for higher quality and more diverse foods. The total number of beef and buffalo \nnumbers  (23  million)  has  only  increased  marginally,  while  the  number  of  dairy  cows  has \nincreased by about 50% as the demand for fresh milk has risen. Overall, from 1995 to 2000 the \nannual average growth in production was 2.7% for milk and milk products, 4.3% for meat, and \n7.7% for eggs, indicating an increasing demand for livestock products as a result of economic \ngrowth, higher incomes, and urbanization. Goat and sheep (14 million) have increased only \nmarginally, but poultry numbers have risen by 72% with a significant growth in commercial \noperations around urban areas. \n \n3.  The livestock subsector is the primary source of animal power for land cultivation, which \nhas historically been its most important contribution. In recent years, however, the subsector \nhas provided an increasing volume of eggs, broiler meat, and milk to the domestic market. \nAlthough the per capita consumption of animal and poultry products remains low, the demand \nfor milk, meat, and eggs will be proportionally stronger as household incomes increase. The \nsubsector has also been an important foreign exchange earner through the export of hides, \nskins, and leather products. From 1995 to 2000, exports of these products earned about $190 \nmillion per year accounting for up to 5% of foreign export earnings and made them the fourth \nlargest foreign exchange earner after garments, jute, and shrimp.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  review  of  the  Bangladesh  livestock  sector2 \nconcluded that, although the subsector makes meaningful contributions to the economy and to \nemployment, it has the potential to expand its production base and significantly improve rural \nlivelihoods  and  incomes,  especially  among  the  poor.  Most  livestock  are  still  managed \ntraditionally.  Feeding  is  inadequate  and  vulnerability  to  diseases  is  prevalent.  Production \ncoefficients are among the lowest in Asia, and all types of livestock record high mortalities. \nIndigenous breeds of animals and poultry predominate, but they lack the genetic potential to \nrealize the benefits of better management and disease control. The technology and inputs \nrequired to improve livestock coefficients and overall production are simple and proven, but \n                                                 \n1 Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided.

Bangladesh Livestock Sector Review. Manila. ", "2  \ntransfer of this knowledge has not been sufficiently extensive. The Department of Livestock \nServices  (DLS)  has  primary  responsibility  for  livestock  improvement.  While  DLS  has  a \nnationwide network of staff and systems, it has not been able to make significant changes in \ntraditional management practices. This inability to change prevailing conditions can be partly \nattributed to the technical culture of the DLS that principally views livestock improvement as a \nveterinary and animal husbandry challenge rather than an economic farming systems activity. \n \n5.  The ADB livestock sector review noted that nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have \ndeveloped  alternative  approaches  to  livestock  improvement  that  have  been  successful  in \nintroducing  better  management  systems  and  improved  breeds.  The  NGO  concept  treats \nlivestock production as a distinct farming enterprise within the farming system. Small farmers \nhave been offered a technical and microfinance package with the relevant supporting services. \nParticipating households have dramatically outperformed traditional management systems and \nsignificantly increased their overall income. A particular focus has been on landless households \nwith the development of inexpensive improved poultry and other livestock enterprises. Income \nfrom these activities has made a major contribution to poverty reduction in the target areas. \nThese households have not been able to access microfinance through the formal banking \nsystem to invest in livestock enterprises. The provision of microfinance and technical support \nthrough NGOs addresses this need. \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s planning and poverty reduction strategies recognize the success of \nthis new approach to livestock development and its effectiveness in raising incomes among the \npoorest rural households. The national strategy for economic growth, poverty reduction and \nsocial development3 places special emphasis on the role of the private sector and of NGOs in \nlivestock development. The strategy recommends that NGO activities concentrate on target \ngroup formation, training, extension, microfinance disbursement, supervision and recovery, and \nconducting socioeconomic studies. The strategy also stresses that public sector projects with \nsimilar components should be implemented by NGOs. The strategy emphasizes the need for \nthe livestock sector to create additional income in rural areas through both service delivery and \nproduction. A plan for the future development of the livestock subsector is in Appendix 1. \n \n7.  In its country operations strategy4 and its partnership agreement on poverty reduction5 \nwith the Government, ADB has recognized the important role that the livestock subsector can \nplay in poverty reduction by providing food, cash income, and employment opportunities for the \nrural poor. The country strategy recommends that ADB\u2019s future involvement in the livestock \nsubsector should be to provide microfinance and policy support prioritizing the (i) development \nof the capabilities of NGOs and local communities to plan, research, and manage livestock \ndevelopment; (ii) provision of additional microfinance to the poor through NGOs and other \nagencies; (iii) development of mechanisms for the sustainability of NGO operations in the \nsubsector; and (iv) support to DLS in reorienting its policies and service delivery.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s previous involvement in livestock development has been through three projects.6 \nThe first two were designed for and implemented by DLS. They focused on providing DLS with \n                                                 \n3 Government of Bangladesh. Ministry of Finance. 2003.

In the most \nrecent project, the Participatory Livestock Development Project  (PLDP), the emphasis shifted to \ndeveloping  small  farmer  enterprises  where  loan  funds  were  delivered  through  a  financial \nwholesaler,  the  Palli  Karma-Sahayak  Foundation  (PKSF),  to  a  group  of  10  NGOs  for \nmicrofinanced  livestock  development  packages  for  poor  rural  farmers  with  DLS  technical \nsupport (para. 5). The PLDP benefited about 400,000 households, over 70% of them headed by \nwomen. An initial project impact evaluation in 2002 estimated that incomes rose by more than \n50% in the surveyed households. In addition, monthly household expenditures for food, clothing, \nand school expenses; and household savings7 showed significant (25\u201375%) increases. \n \n9.  The PLDP demonstrated that it is possible to successfully deliver a large number of \ntechnically supported, microfinanced livestock improvement packages through PKSF and its \npartner NGOs with DLS technical support. Impacts were positive on the income and standard of \nliving of poor households. However, a key lesson learned is that the PLDP\u2019s prescriptive design \nand targets did not provide the NGOs with sufficient flexibility to engage a wide range of poor \nhouseholds, particularly the ultrapoor. Similarly, the project design limited beneficiaries in their \nchoice  of  investment  enterprise,  and  opportunities  to  exploit  local  marketing  and  resource \nadvantages were lost. The proposed Project will offer a more extensive menu of enterprises to \nmaximize livestock development opportunities, and enterprise selection will be demand driven \nto allow local skills and production advantages to be fully used. \n \n10.  Other external assistance to the livestock subsector has similarly supported small farmer \ndevelopment  initiatives  (Appendix  2).  The  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development \n(IFAD) and Danish International Development Assistance (Danida) have funded smallholder \nlivestock  development  projects.  DLS  executed  these  projects  in  collaboration  with  several \nnational NGOs. Consistent with the Government\u2019s policy directives, the more recent externally \nfunded projects (PLDP, the Community Livestock and Dairy Development Project of the United \nNations Development Programme, and a recently approved IFAD microfinance project), used or \nwill use PKSF and participating NGOs as executing agencies, with DLS providing technical \nsupport.   \n \n11.  A reorientation of the role of DLS in the subsector will encourage increased private \nsector  investment  and  provision  of  services.  The  continued  presence  of  DLS  in  providing \nselected subsidized input supplies acts as a disincentive to private companies.8 There is need to \ndirect DLS\u2019s resources into those areas where it has a comparative advantage and national \nresponsibility. ADB\u2019s livestock sector review has highlighted the need for a new policy direction \nfor DLS. Danida is supporting a Policy and Planning Support Unit (PPSU) in the Ministry of \nFisheries and Livestock (MFL) that is providing technical assistance to support this process. The \ncontinued  expansion  of  the  role  of  NGOs  and  private  companies  in  livestock  production \ninitiatives and provision of services will allow DLS to concentrate on the core tasks of disease \ncontrol at the borders, disease diagnostic services, and quarantine management.  \n \n12.  Building on the achievements of the PLDP and past projects, there are opportunities to \nfurther expand the scope of livestock development to include a wider range of production and \n                                                                                                                                                          \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for the Participatory Livestock Development Project. Manila. \n7 The PLDP was closed on 10 July 2003. Achievement of its development objectives and implementation progress \nwere highly satisfactory. The project completion report will  be prepared in 2004. \n8  DLS has been working toward compliance with the action plan prepared in the PLDP to commercialize its poultry \nproduction farms and the veterinary vaccine production laboratory. The revised action plan specifies that full \nproduction costs at the laboratory will be recovered by 30 June 2005. ", "4  \ninput supply enterprises. Up to 30 June 2003 in the PLDP, 265,000 beneficiaries had borrowed \nabout  $36  million,  with  almost  a  100%  repayment  rate,  to  finance  livestock  production \nenterprises. Some beneficiaries borrowed multiple times, indicating willingness of the poor to \nborrow funds to invest in livestock production. As NGOs become more experienced, they can \noffer a more diversified investment program under the proposed Project that would include beef, \ndairy, and goat enterprises; small-scale product processing units; and input supply services. \nProspective project beneficiaries have shown interest in investing in such enterprises. NGOs \nhave the capacity to provide complementary training to satisfy the growing demand from farmer \ncommunities for skills in product marketing and providing their own disease control and feed \nsupply services. The proposed Project will support these new and diversified opportunities \nthrough a demand-driven training and investment program. \n \n13.  While small-scale livestock development projects have been successful in improving the \nlivelihoods of large numbers of poor households, existing programs such as the PLDP still do \nnot reach many families. These families are in the ultrapoor category at the lowest level of the \npoverty  strata,  surviving  on  day  labor  or  begging  and with  no  confidence  or  prospects of \nimproving their situation. Several NGOs have developed programs that provide training and \nasset  development  for  ultrapoor  households  as  a  preliminary  stage  to  graduating  into \nmicrofinanced livestock enterprise investments. The proposed Project would finance a pilot \nprogram to support ultrapoor households in those subdistricts where families are vulnerable to \nflood damage and lose land through river erosion.    \n \n14.  The existing market system for livestock appears to function relatively effectively and \nefficiently. The well-developed supply chains and marketing competition have steadily expanded \nsales. There still remain opportunities for farmers to increase their returns through improved and \nbetter-informed  marketing  practices.  The  Government  has  recognized  that  increasing  the \nnumber of rural marketing facilities is a means of improving sale prices in remote rural areas. \nThe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is implementing an established market \ngrowth  center  program.  In  addition  to  market  development,  improved  management  of  the \nhygiene of slaughter facilities and slabs is needed. Consumer awareness programs on meat \nquality, combined with training programs in meat handling and hygiene for local butchers and \nmeat sellers, are required to improve the situation. \n \n15.  The poverty reduction strategies of both the Government and ADB recognize that the \ncontinued  development  of  viable  small  farmer  and  agribusiness  enterprises  is essential  to \npoverty reduction in the rural areas. Opportunities to engage large numbers of poor households \nin  rural  enterprises  are  limited,  but  innovative  small  farmer  developments  in  the  livestock \nsubsector have increased cash incomes, improved food quality and quantity, and created more \nemployment for the rural poor. The proposed Project will further develop these opportunities \nthrough  an  integrated program  of  training  and  enterprise  investment  that  will  increase  the \ncapabilities of the target communities and broaden poverty reduction impacts. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n16.  The Project aims to reduce rural poverty in 20 districts of northwest Bangladesh (Map, p. \nvii) by increasing income-generating activities and employment in livestock-related enterprises \nfor the rural poor, particularly landless households and households headed by women. The \nProject will (i) build individual and community capability to identify and manage production \nenterprises;  (ii)  provide  microfinance  for  a  range  of  income-generating  activities  including ", "                                                                                           5                               \nlivestock  enterprises,  small  businesses,  and  marketing  initiatives;  and  (iii)  support  the \ndevelopment of livestock input supply services and employment opportunities in the private \nsector. The Project will specifically target the ultrapoor and support them in asset development \nand social mobilization. DLS capacity building will also be supported. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n17.  The Project will (i) seek to improve community capabilities to develop and manage \nincome-generating activities, through a technical and social development training program; (ii) \nprovide microfinance and technical supporting services for livestock enterprise development, \nincluding assistance to the ultrapoor through a pilot program of asset development and training; \n(iii) build DLS capacity; and (iv) support the Project\u2019s implementing and management agencies. \nThe total project area will cover 157 subdistricts in 20 districts; 68 of these subdistricts and 3 \ndistricts will be areas that have not received assistance under the PLDP. The project framework \nis in Appendix 3. \n \n1.  Community Development  \n \na.  Community Mobilization \n18.  To reduce their vulnerabilities and expand opportunities for them, the poor must be \nassisted to achieve certain social assets, such as supportive ties with other members of their \ncommunities;  mutual  support  within  their  own  organizations;  and  access  to  government \nadministrative and service agencies, and resources. The Project intends to reach approximately \n660,000  poorer  farming  families  (32%  of  poverty-affected  households  in  the  project  area), \nprimarily households not covered under the PLDP. For the poverty reduction investment, the \nProject will target poor people\u2014particularly women\u2014who are categorized as landless, small \nmarginal farmers, and farmers of the riverbed flood areas and riverbank areas.  \n \n19.  Through training programs delivered by participating NGOs, this component will help \ncommunities  mobilize  into  groups,  develop  an  awareness  of  marketing  and  enterprise \nopportunities, and improve farmers\u2019 capabilities to use microfinance and other input services \neffectively. With NGO support, groups will be encouraged to form associations that take a \nbroader view of community issues and interests, as the basis for empowering communities to \naddress  and  make  community  issues  known  at  higher  government  levels  (subdistrict  and \ndistrict), and thus enable the poor to demand accountability for public resources spent locally. \nGiven the target population, the number of groups to be formed and strengthened under the \nProject will be approximately 26,000.  \n \n20.  In the PLDP, the NGO delivery system focused on basic farmer technical training and on \nmicrofinance delivery  and recovery. Experience indicates that a  more balanced and multi-\nfaceted approach to delivery of farmer services is needed. Besides livestock technology, social \ndevelopment and microfinance/agribusiness management services need to be made available \nto farmers. Under the Project, the NGO staffing ratio to farming families will be reduced from \n1:500 to 1:300. Participating NGOs will deploy field staff to primary groups on the basis of \napproximately 1 field worker for 14 groups (300 members). This will enable the field worker to \nattend weekly group meetings, provide on-site training and facilitate technical support, and \nmonitor project implementation.  \n \n21.  The project management unit (PMU) will recruit NGOs and specialized service providers \nto handle training in milk chilling center operation, in developing a cadre of milk entrepreneurs, ", "6  \nmilk treatment, and marketing. Similarly, training and capability development are proposed for \nlive animal market management committees, butchers, and meat shop owners. Farmer group \nleaders  and  members  will  be  trained  in  the  technical  and  business  aspects  of  enterprise \nmanagement. Groups and individuals will be trained to manage local processing, marketing, \nand input supply activities. Existing traders, including those involved in livestock selling, milk \nvending, and animal health drug supply will be included in this training subcomponent. \n \nb.  Community Extension Workers \n22.  Communities will also be assisted to develop the capacity to service their own livestock \nimprovement needs through training of local community extension workers (CEWs) selected by \nNGOs based on agreed upon criteria. The CEWs will earn income with the community paying \nfor their services in cash or in kind. CEWs will provide on-demand service in livestock extension, \nanimal  vaccination,  drug  supply,  forage  inputs,  group  strengthening,  and  a  link  between \nindividual farmers and their organizations and DLS or NGOs. To facilitate this process, the \nProject will support basic animal health, disease diagnosis and control, and production services \ndelivery from livestock service centers operating at union council level from the union council \ncomplexes, or NGO area offices. The CEWs will be key actors in the centers, supported by the \nNGOs and subdistrict DLS staff as required. To improve the delivery and impact of livestock \ntechnical training in the target communities, DLS will train the CEWs as trainers. These training \nskills will allow the CEWs to improve the skills of farmer groups and entrepreneurs of small \nlivestock input supplies.  \n \n2.  Livestock Enterprise Development  \na.  Livestock Enterprises \n23.  This subcomponent will provide about 300,000 households with microfinance (including \na savings program) for livestock enterprises. Participating households will be identified and \nselected through the regular participatory methods used by PKSF and its partner NGOs.  About \n20 poultry, ruminant, and supporting input supply enterprises have been identified as financially \nprofitable and sustainable. With NGO and DLS assistance, qualified households will select the \nmost appropriate enterprise to match their capability, physical resources, and local market \ndemands. Microfinance will cover livestock, equipment, and infrastructure.  \n \n24.  NGOs will implement all facets of this component with full beneficiary participation, in \ncooperation with DLS. PKSF will select the NGOs on the basis of their existing microfinance \nmanagement performance, their operational strength in the project area, and the quality and \ndepth  of  their  supporting  technical  and  community  development  staff  resources.  To  take \nadvantage of the existing skills base and implementing experience and knowledge of farmer \ngroups and area networks, preference will be given to NGOs that participated in the PLDP. \nHowever, PKSF will use NGO selection criteria that will require the NGOs to have and maintain \nfor the project period suitably qualified technical, social mobilization, training, and microfinance \nmanagement  staff.  NGOs  will  derive  their  individual  annual  investment  programs  from \nparticipatory planning exercises with beneficiaries, and the plans will be finalized in consultation \nwith the PMU.  \n \n25.  As the scale and composition of the actual beneficiary investments will be developed \nthrough participatory planning, the phasing and costing of the component\u2019s activities will be \nindicative. However, it is expected that about 250,000 microfinance packages will be provided to \nfirst-time borrowers in the new project area of subdistricts. These loans are likely to be for ", "                                                                                           7                               \npoultry, small ruminant, and input supply enterprises. About 50,000 credit packages for more \nsophisticated  enterprises  will  be  provided  to  borrowers  that  have  successfully  undertaken \nprevious  livestock  projects  in  the  area  and  are  ready  to  expand  their  income-generating \nactivities. \n \n26.  DLS will also provide technical support to the participating NGOs as required. Such \nsupport will include technical training to NGO trainers, and backup disease diagnostic work. \nDLS will recruit and assign one DLS subdistrict livestock officer to each participating NGO to \ncoordinate such services and ensure that the support services are delivered effectively. The \nPMU will also use contract service providers for specialized services. \n \n27.  A pilot program will be implemented to support social and enterprise development, and \nthe establishment of an initial asset base for ultrapoor households. The underlying objective will \nbe to capture those very poor households that have either not participated in income-generating \nenterprise  programs,  or  previously  participated  but  dropped  out.  PKSF  will  implement  the \nprogram.  The  criteria  for  identifying  qualified  beneficiaries  will  include  households  that  (i) \ndepend on income from female day work or begging; (ii) own less than 0.04 hectare of land \nincluding the homestead; (iii) have no adult active male member; (iv) if children are present, are \nunable  to  pay  for  schooling;  and  (v)  do  not  receive  current  assistance  from  any  other \ngovernment or NGO supporting program. In addition, the household should have at least one \nactive adult woman that can be involved in an income-generating activity. The beneficiaries will \nbe identified through a combination of surveys, focus group discussions, and community-level \nmeetings.  Locally  based  staff  will  use  participatory  assessment  tools  to  select  the  most \nvulnerable households.  \n \n28.  After households have been selected, program staff will initially train each household on \nasset transfer, health management, and social responsibilities. Awareness raising training will \nbe provided. Participants will choose income-generating activities from a variety of poultry, goat, \nbeef and dairy cattle, vegetable, and nursery and small trading enterprises provided in kind as a \ngrant, together with the appropriate technical training. A disaster management fund will be \ninitiated as a safety net against loan default caused by natural disasters. A flexible savings \nprogram will be an integral part of the program, and participants will be encouraged to save \nmoderate sums to refinance their future enterprise activities. Underpinning the program will be \nweekly intensive follow-up and supervision that will guide and support the participants. The \nprogram will be implemented in 2004 and 2005 and will involve 5,000 households. \n \n    b.  Marketing and Small Business Development  \n \n29.  NGOs with cash-flow-based lending experience will provide credit for small-scale peri-\nurban milk processing and retailing entrepreneurs, traders in other livestock products, and larger \ninput supply enterprises under this subcomponent. It has been estimated that there could be a \ndemand during the project period for additional milk collection and small-scale milk chilling units, \nand for batch pasteurizing and packaging units that would produce small milk packs for the local \nurban markets. The Project will support the development of markets and slaughter slabs as part \nof the Government\u2019s market growth center program for the rural areas. About 150 new livestock \nmarkets in existing market growth centers will be built, about 50 existing livestock markets will \nbe improved, and about 50 slaughter slabs will be supplied in market livestock corners to \nspecific livestock-owning communities where these investments would add significant value to \nfarmer returns. LGED will build new livestock markets only on land that is already owned by the \nGovernment. No resettlement of people, including squatters, will be involved. In addition, the ", "8  \nPMU will provide funds for marketing promotions, and a consumer awareness program on meat \nhygiene. \n \nc.  Innovation and Applied Research \n30.  This subcomponent will be executed by DLS to provide applied research and initial \ncapital for innovations that would directly assist small livestock farmers to increase their income \nearning and marketing opportunities. It will explore development opportunities for new poultry \nbreeds that could raise productivity levels in the village environment, and new management \nsystems that could better use feed and labor resources. It will investigate the improvement of \nthe black Bengal goat breed, and systems for improved feed storage and nutrient enhancement. \nTo raise the performance of beef and dairy cattle at the village level, emphasis will be on the \ncultivation and use of higher-value forage in existing farming systems. DLS, in cooperation with \nthe PMU, will prepare annually a schedule of research subprojects that will be circulated to \nresearch  organizations,  individual  researchers,  university  departments,  and  other  suitably \nstaffed organizations for tendering. Successful applicants will be contracted by the PMU. The \nDLS technical specialists attached to the PMU will evaluate the performance of the subprojects. \nIn addition, there will be opportunities for stakeholders to develop their own applied research \nproposals for project funding.  \n \n3.  Capacity Building for the Department of Livestock Services \n31.  A  comprehensive  institutional  analysis  and  future  development  plan  for  DLS  was \nprepared in 2003 with Danida and PPSU support. MFL is in the process of approving the 3-year \nand 10-year action plans, to be supported by Danida, to transform DLS into a facilitator and \nregulator of sector development, a promoter of private sector development, with the goal of \ncontributing to poverty reduction. The Project, in cooperation with the Danida-funded PPSU, will \nsupport the change process as DLS and its staff begin to redefine their functions and orientation \nto become facilitators of change, rather than continue as technical extension agents. To assist \nin reorienting the staff members who will become department managers in the next decade, a \npostgraduate diploma program in leadership and management dealing with development and \nsocial  change;  systems,  strategic  thinking,  and  capacity  building;  financial  resource \nmanagement; interorganizational relations networks, and partnerships and coalitions; and policy \ndevelopment and advocacy will be made available to DLS district and subdistrict staff, including \nwomen, primarily located within the project area. This training, to be provided by local and \nforeign universities, is highly relevant to the future needs of the DLS. It will provide a cadre of \nofficers that are equipped to plan and make the changes in DLS\u2019s future role and policies. The \nProject will also support the creation of a DLS headquarters institutional change team, and \nsupport DLS staff skills development in essential areas, as specified in the action plan for DLS\u2019s \nfuture development. The DLS monitoring and evaluation cell will also be strengthened. Funds \nwill  be  provided  for  construction  of  some  DLS  facilities,  such  as  27  subdistrict  livestock \ndevelopment centers, and disease monitoring will be strengthened. DLS will implement this \ncomponent, and the PPSU will monitor and support effective implementation.  \n \n32.  MFL and DLS have prepared a revised action plan to (i) phase out the remaining \nsubsidies  on  livestock  products  produced  by  DLS;  (ii)  continue  commercialization  of  the \nveterinary vaccine production laboratory, with the objective of having the private sector become \nthe major supplier of vaccines in the country by 30 June 2005 at the latest; and (iii) continue the \ncommercialization of Government-owned poultry production farms in the project area, with the \nobjective of making the private sector the major producer of day-old chicks in the country by 30 \nJune 2005 at the latest. The Project will assist DLS in implementing the action plan by providing ", "                                                                                           9                               \nspecialist  assistance  as  required  (Assurances,  [xi]).  The  existing  policy  environment  and \ncommercializing these functions will not be an impediment to the project\u2019s implementation, given \nthat NGOs and the private sector already supply about 75% of the market for many livestock \ninputs.     \n \n4.  Project Services  \na.  Project Management \n33.  The Project will provide PKSF with the financial resources necessary to support the \neffective  management  and  coordination  of  project  activities.  PKSF  will  appoint  a  project \nmanager and staff for a small liaison office in Dhaka. PKSF and DLS will also appoint project \ndeputy directors to the PMU. The Project will provide funding for an independently recruited, \nprofessional PMU that will be located in Rangpur in the project area, and will be staffed by a \nteam of domestically recruited specialists, including (i) a rural development specialist (project \ndirector);9  (ii)  training  and  livestock  improvement  specialist;  (iii)  monitoring,  evaluation  and \nmanagement  information  specialist;  and  (iv)  accountant.  DLS  will  also  assist  the  PMU  by \nassigning specialist staff to it as required. \n \nb.  Implementation \n34.  NGOs selected by the PMU will be allocated operational areas, and will be responsible \nfor delivering microfinance and training services to the participating beneficiaries. The NGOs will \nuse existing area offices or establish new ones as their operational base. To assist the NGOs in \nestablishing their outreach capability in the new project area, the Project will provide limited \nsupport for small motorcycles and bicycles, equipment, and furniture in new subdistrict area \noffices, and for new participating NGOs. While the project microfinance and training activities \nare initially being developed, the salaries and operating costs of these offices will be funded by \nthe Project for 2 years until the new NGOs have generated sufficient savings from their lending \nmargins to finance the overhead costs. After this period, the NGO area offices will be self-\nfinancing using their lending margins.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n     \n35.  The Project will provide training and microfinance to individuals and communities to \nassist them in developing a range of sustainable rural enterprises that will raise incomes and \nincrease employment in the project area. The Project will use a participatory planning process \nthat will recognize the different needs of beneficiaries, and it will respond with specific options \nand solutions. Unlike its predecessors, the Project is not prescriptive and is not target driven. \nExpected project outputs are indicative, but are firmly focused on raising rural incomes across \nthe full spectrum of poor households, and particularly of poor women, with the expectation that \npoverty in the project area will be significantly reduced. \n \n36.  The Project will be implemented by NGOs with full beneficiary participation. The project \nplanning and delivery services require that project management and the implementing agencies \nhave a broad understanding of rural development issues, and extensive experience in working \nwith rural communities. An independently recruited group of specialists will staff the PMU. \n                                                 \n9 A rural development specialist, preferably with livestock experience, is considered appropriate because of the \nProject\u2019s emphasis on community development, participatory processes, and delivery of microfinance to the \nbeneficiaries. ", "10  \nProject implementation will be carried out by qualified NGOs\u2014each of which has an operational \nnetwork in the project area\u2014and DLS.  \n \n37.   A key output will be an enhanced capacity to sustain and expand commercial enterprise \nand  community  development  after  the  Project  has  concluded.  Farmer  groups  that  have \nestablished their own self-employed extension workers (for vaccinations, forage development, \nand animal breeding services), and that have worked together in larger associations will be \nbetter  positioned  to  further  develop  their  production  and  marketing  operations.  Also, \nparticipating NGOs, especially those with small local outreach areas, will be better equipped to \ncontinue and diversify their activities beyond the project period.   \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n38.  The estimated project cost is $55.8 million equivalent, inclusive of physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $5.0 million, or about 9% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency cost is estimated at $50.8 million equivalent, or about 91% of the total cost. The local \ncurrency costs include an estimated $1.6 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by \nthe Government, PKSF, and the beneficiaries. The cost estimates summarized in Table 1 \nshould be regarded as indicative only.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  The Government has requested a loan of $20.0 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources to help finance 36% of the project cost. The loan will finance $4.7 million of the \nforeign exchange cost (94% of the total foreign exchange cost) and $15.3 million equivalent of \nthe local currency cost (30% of the total local currency cost). Danida will provide $0.5 million \nparallel and tied grant financing, or 1% of the project cost, for DLS capacity building. PKSF has \nbeen requested to provide $16.5 million equivalent, or 29% of the project cost. The participating \nNGOs will contribute $11.1 million equivalent, or 20% of the project cost. The beneficiary \nhouseholds that receive microfinance packages will contribute $2.1 million or 4% of the project \ncost  through  their  labor  and  cash  inputs  in  establishing  the  livestock  and  small  business \nenterprises. Local cost financing is justified, given the poverty-oriented nature of the Project and \nthe tight fiscal situation in the country.  \n \n40.  The Borrower will be the Government of Bangladesh. The ADB loan will have a maturity \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and an interest charge of 1.5% per annum during the amortization \nperiod. The Government will relend to PKSF the portion of the ADB loan required for carrying \nout the microfinance and credit lending activities in parts of components 2a and b of the Project, \nin accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary loan and grant agreement. The Government \nwill provide the funds for components 1a, parts of 2a and 2b, and 4 to PKSF as a grant. Funds \nfor components 1b, part of 2a, 2c, and 3 will be provided to DLS. The subsidiary loan and grant \nagreement will contain procedures, terms and conditions, and implementation arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. PKSF will in turn onlend to participating NGOs under subloan agreements, \nand NGOs will use these funds as microfinance for farmers and entrepreneurs. The subloan \nagreements will specify procedures, terms and conditions, and implementation arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.

The Project will require close coordination between PKSF, DLS, and participating NGOs. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) for components 1a, part of 2a, 2b, and 4 of the Project will be \nPKSF. DLS will be the EA for components 1b, part of 2a, 2c, and 3. DLS will appoint a project \ndeputy director to be based in Rangpur in the PMU and to supervise DLS project activities. DLS \nand PKSF performed well in the PLDP. PKSF has managed three projects for the World Bank, \nthe IFAD Employment Generation Project, and participated in the PLDP, and has demonstrated \nthe  ability  to  coordinate  effectively  and  manage  microfinance  and  related  services  with \nparticipating NGOs. PKSF has the necessary organizational structure and staff skills to manage \nsuccessfully a large and diverse development project. It has also shown a readiness to recruit, \nfor project execution, additional staff with required technical and social development skills. DLS \neffectively managed the PLDP. Participating NGOs will be required to meet rigorous selection \nand performance criteria. Most NGOs that participated in the PLDP demonstrated their capacity \nto provide community development and technical training, and microfinance to beneficiaries on \na  sustainable  basis,  even  to  the  extent  of  using  their  own  financial  resources  to  lend  to \nbeneficiaries. \n \n42.  A project steering committee10 will be established to oversee the implementation of the \nProject.  The committee will meet as necessary, but not less than once a year, to review \nprogress. PKSF will appoint a project manager to coordinate its project activities through the \nProjects  Division  in  its  Dhaka  office.  An  implementation  coordination  committee  will  be \nestablished to guide the PMU on a regular basis.11 PKSF, in cooperation with DLS, will establish \na  field-level  PMU  based  in  Rangpur  staffed  by  independently  recruited  subject  matter \nspecialists, and headed by a project director. The project organization chart is in Appendix 5. \nThe PPSU will support the DLS capacity building component and effective coordination of \nproject activities. \n \n43.  The PMU will act as a facilitating agency. It will (i) prepare annual work plans, and the \nrelevant project reports in consultation with the implementing NGOs and other service providers; \n(ii) supervise all project activities and the performance of the implementing agencies and service \nproviders; and (iii) carry out field-level monitoring and evaluation of project activities, project \noutputs, and expected impacts. Unlike in the PLDP, the PMU will be adequately staffed with \nqualified and independently recruited specialists to ensure implementation effectiveness. PKSF \nand DLS have also appointed deputy project directors to the PMU, and LGED has designated a \nproject coordinator. A committee composed of representatives of ADB, PKSF, and DLS will \nselect the PMU staff, within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The PMU will be accountable to \nPKSF, and PKSF will be accountable to the Government for the Project, with the exception of \nthe components implemented by DLS.   \n                                                 \n10 The secretaries of the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and MFL will cochair the committee; the \ncore members will include representatives of the Economics Relations Division (ERD) of the MOF, the Planning \nCommission and the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Ministry of Planning, and \nthe Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development; and the managing director of PKSF. Other members will \ninclude representatives of DLS (director general), PKSF, LGED, and participating NGOs. The committee will not \nmake any decisions that infringe on the policies and procedures of PKSF. \n11A deputy managing director of PKSF or other representative of PKSF will chair the committee, and the core \nmembers will include representatives of the ERD and the Finance Division of MOF, the Planning Commission, and \nthe IMED of the Ministry of Planning, DLS, LGED, and the MFL; the PKSF and DLS deputy project directors, and \nthe  LGED  project  coordinator;  and  the  PMU  project  director.  Other  members  or  observers  may  include \nrepresentatives of participating NGOs and the PPSU. ", "                                                                                        1   3                               \n \n  2.  Component Implementation \n \n44.  A group of established NGOs with operational networks in the project area will be the \nimplementing agencies for the training programs under the community development component \nand the microfinance activities in the livestock enterprise development component to ensure \nsustainable  development  in  the  subsector.  As  needed,  they  will  utilize  other  agencies  for \nspecialized  training.  Qualified  NGOs  will  deliver  and  manage  the  credit  activities  in  the \nmarketing and small business development subcomponent. PKSF and the NGOs will sign \nagreements regarding NGO responsibilities for project implementation activities, accountability, \nand repayment of loans to PKSF. DLS and other service providers will support the delivery of \ntechnical services (including the innovation subcomponent) and technical training to NGOs, and \nwill act as facilitator for livestock improvement in the project area. PKSF will provide funds to \nLGED to implement and execute construction of local markets and slaughter slabs. PKSF will \nimplement the subcomponent for the ultrapoor.  \n  \n  3.  Implementation Period \n \n45.  The Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, beginning in the second quarter of \n2004.  Initial  activities  will  be  recruiting  consultants  for  the  PMU;  establishing  a  project \nperformance management system (PPMS) in PKSF to monitor microfinance delivery and project \nefficiency and effectiveness; carrying out benchmark surveys, participatory rapid appraisals and \ncommunity  discussions;  and  procuring  of  essential  equipment  and  vehicles.  Enterprise \ndevelopment and microfinance disbursements in new project areas will be delivered starting in \nthe second quarter of 2005, while in the PLDP areas, these activities will continue without \ninterruption. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n  4.  Lending Terms and Conditions \n \n46.  Supervised  microfinance  and  social  intermediation  activities  have  a  high  cost.  The \nGovernment has agreed that part of the concessionality of ADB\u2019s Special Funds loan will be \nused to provide an adequate interest spread to cover all costs, provision for bad and doubtful \ndebts, and an adequate profit margin. The Government will relend $7.5 million equivalent to \nPKSF at a service charge of 1.25% a year for 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The \nBorrower will bear the foreign exchange risk for the ADB loan. PKSF now has a policy of \nonlending to participating NGOs at an interest rate of not more than 4.5\u20137%, depending on the \nNGO\u2019s size, with a repayment period of up to 3 years. This low onlending margin is designed to \npermit participating NGOs to use their interest spread to fund training and capacity-building \nactivities. The PKSF lending spread of 3.25\u20135.75% will be used to cover the cost of evaluating \nand  selecting  NGOs,  monitoring  their  performance,  and  training  NGO  staff  in  financial \nmanagement; other operating costs; credit risks; and profit.12 Participating NGOs will pass on \nthe proceeds of the PKSF subloan to poultry, beef-fattening, and goat-rearing (and other small \nanimals) smallholders; and to entrepreneurs investing in processing enterprises at the prevailing \nmarket rate, currently around 20% declining balance, keeping a margin of about 15% to cover \nsocial mobilization, group formation and social awareness training, skills training, monitoring \nloan collection and extension activities, other operating costs, and allowance for bad debts.  \n \n \n                                                 \n12 This margin is sufficient to cover PKSF\u2019s credit risk since, as of June 2003, the NGO repayment rate to PKSF was \n98.4%. ", "14  \n  5.  Procurement \n \n47.  Goods, related services, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since any civil works will be small and widely dispersed, \nforeign  contractors  are  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding.  Consequently,  all  civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified \ncontractors in accordance with the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nPrequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to the approval of \nADB. The concerned LGED district executive engineer, under the guidance of the LGED project \ncoordinator, will award contracts for livestock market improvements. LGED will award contracts \nfor infrastructure construction and improvement that prioritize the involvement of poor people. \nThere may not be supply contracts for equipment or materials estimated to cost $500,000 or \nmore;  but  should  a  contract  be  required  it  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive bidding, and any contract costing less than the equivalent of $500,000 (other than \nminor items) will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. Direct purchase procedures \nwill be used for small or off-the-shelf items costing less than $100,000, including equipment and \nvehicles procured by the PMU. Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 7.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n48.  Consulting  services  will  be  supplied  by  (i)  the  PMU  implementation  consultants \n(approximately 400 domestic person-months), and (ii) institutional change consultants (about \n145  person-months,  43  international  and  102  domestic)  recruited  by  DLS  to  support \nimplementation of its action for institutional change.13 A committee comprising representatives \nof ADB, PKSF, and DLS will select the PMU implementation consultants, whose contracts will \nbe  administered  by  PKSF.  DLS  will  select  the  institutional  change  consultants.  The  PMU \nimplementation  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  while  the  institutional  change \nconsultants will be selected as firms. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Quality-and cost-based selection procedures will be used in recruiting the \nconsultants. The Government will undertake advance action in recruiting the implementation \nconsultants to facilitate the start-up of implementation. The Government has been advised that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to approve the Project or to finance the \nrecruitment  costs.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  implementation  and  institutional \nconsultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n7.  Disbursements \n49.  To ensure effective project implementation and timely disbursement, the Government \nwill establish two imprest accounts for PKSF and DLS in the name of the Project at the \nBangladesh  Bank  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nand detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest \naccounts will not exceed the estimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 months, or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Payments for eligible items will be made through \nthe accounts. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure is applicable for reimbursing \neligible expenditures and liquidating advances under the imprest accounts for any individual \npayment  below  $50,000  equivalent.  All  project  expenditures  incurred  by  project  agencies \n(PKSF, DLS, LGED, and NGOs) will be submitted by PKSF and DLS to ADB for reimbursement. \n                                                 \n13 Danida will provide about $500,000 in addition to ADB\u2019s support for the institutional change consultants. ", "                                                                                        1   5                               \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The PMU will submit to DLS, PKSF, and ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on \nproject  implementation.  The  PMU  will  particularly  address  progress  in  meeting  the  project \ntargets. The progress reports will have information on the physical progress of the project, the \nstatus of the community and capacity development component, the enterprise development \ncomponent, the ultrapoor subcomponent, and other project components. Within 3 months of \nsubstantial physical completion of the Project, the PMU will submit to DLS, PKSF, and ADB a \nproject completion report that will cover the details of project implementation, cost, project \nperformance management activities, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n51.  PKSF  and  DLS  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to  facilitate \nidentification of income and expenditures related to the Project. The PMU will be assigned \nsufficient  and  qualified  accounting  staff,  including  an  accountant.  An  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB will audit annually all the accounts, SOEs, and revenues related to the \nProject.  The  annual  audit  report  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  accounts  and  SOE \nprocedure and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. \nAudited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be \nsubmitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  To ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, a participatory project performance monitoring program is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s PPMS framework, unlike in the PLDP. PKSF already has a comprehensive \nmanagement information system that can be adapted to the project\u2019s information requirements. \nPPMS activities will be conducted periodically to assess whether the project inputs and activities \nhave  delivered  the  expected  outputs  and  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries,  and  at  a \nsustainable cost. The PPMS also seeks to detect at an early stage any discrepancy between \nthe plan and the execution of the Project. The PMU will ensure that initial district-level baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic surveys are conducted, and will submit a detailed implementation \nplan for monitoring performance and for preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PMU will submit annual \nbenefit monitoring reports to ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will be \nconducted to review the progress of the Project before the ADB midterm review. Consultants \nwill complete an impact evaluation study before the PMU prepares the project completion \nreport,  including  an  assessment  of  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  has  strengthened  or \nweakened the participating NGOs as lending institutions. \n \n10.  Project Review \n53.  ADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review, to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB. The regular project reviews will include a review of \nthe performance of PKSF, PMU, DLS, NGOs, and any other project implementing agencies; \nimplementation  of  the  loan  covenants;  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan;  physical \nprogress  of  project  implementation;  and  capacity-building  activities.  The  proposed  midterm \nreview  will  allow  the  Government  and  ADB  to  monitor  the  project  closely  and  to  make \nappropriate adjustments to the project design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n ", "16  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n54.  The Project is justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. There is an undersupply of \ncommunity development and microfinance services in the target areas. These deficiencies will \nbe addressed by providing training and microfinance services to local communities to improve \ntheir participation in development planning and management of their enterprises. The enhanced \nhuman and social capital of the beneficiaries will be a significant outcome. Equity issues will be \naddressed  by  ensuring  that  locally  identified  community  needs  are  incorporated  in  the \ndevelopment plans. The Project will reduce poverty through its expected positive impact on \nhousehold incomes. As the outputs from project-financed activities will be largely determined by \na community demand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the actual mix and scale of the \noutputs. Furthermore, it is not possible to quantify the long-term benefits of the human capital \ndevelopment activities in the community and capacity development components. Therefore, a \nfull  benefit-cost  analysis  for  the  overall  project  was  considered  impractical.  The  summary \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n55.  The main project benefits will be the incremental production of eggs, young chickens, \nhens,  fattened  calves  and  goats,  milk,  and  milk  products.  The  incremental  output  will  be \nconsumed by the beneficiaries, or sold in local and regional markets. Average increases of at \nleast 20% are expected in the annual incomes of poor families. Intermediate outputs such as \nimproved  day-old  chicks,  feed  ingredients,  and  hides  and  skins  will  also  be  sold  to  local \nproducers. Livestock services such as extension and poultry vaccinations will be in demand, \nparticularly as livestock inputs are increasingly provided by the private sector. There will be a \nsignificant increase in beneficiary nutritional levels that has not been quantified. The Project will \nalso provide environmental benefits\u2014manure produced by cattle and poultry is used as fertilizer \nand domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n56.  Investments to develop the livestock subsector have a direct impact on the income and \nnonincome dimensions of poverty across all income groups. This is particularly relevant to the \nsegment of the population living in absolute poverty that is categorized as hard core poor. The \ninability of the poor to access resources, both financial (microfinance, employment) and social \n(education, health, skill development, training, and capacity building), is a significant obstacle in \nthe development of their human capital, which is a key factor for sustainable poverty reduction. \nThere are 2.9 million households in the project area, and it is estimated that about 72% of them \n(2.1 million) are below the poverty line. The Project will assist 660,000 households (31% of the \npoor households), concentrating its activities on the landless and households with women \nheads that are among the poorest of the poor. \n \n57.  Access to a regular and usable flow of financial and social resources through the Project \nwill contribute to poverty reduction by (i) raising the beneficiaries\u2019 levels of empowerment, \nparticularly with regard to accessing services; (ii) increasing the number of organized farmer \n(female and male) groups; (iii) increasing the demand for labor because of the availability of \nresources  for  economic  activities;  (iv)  raising  household  incomes  through  employment \ngeneration;  (v)  enhancing  the  nutritional  status  of  households  through  the  consumption  of \nlivestock  and  dairy  products;  (vi)  increasing  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities;  and  (vii) \nencouraging  the  growth  of  environment-friendly  economic  enterprises.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10.  ", "                                                                                        1   7                               \n \n58.  Direct and quantifiable project benefits will accrue to both primary (poor households, \nparticularly  those  headed  by  women)  and  secondary  (NGOs  and  other  service  providers) \nbeneficiaries. The estimated annual margin (or benefit) from a poultry key rearer enterprise, for \nexample, is Tk3,200 ($56). Adoption of such an enterprise will have a significant impact on \nbeneficiary incomes: a rise of 20% on average for beneficiaries in the very poor, poor, or \nmarginal categories; and over 30% for beneficiaries in very poor households and those headed \nby women. In total, it is expected that the Project will reach at least 250,000 households who \nwould take loans. These households comprise over 900,000 persons in the very poor, poor, or \nmarginal categories, or about 10% of persons in farm households in the project area. Another \n50,000 beneficiaries are expected to adopt a range of more capital-intensive enterprises.  \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n59.  The Project will promote improved and easy access to skills development and capacity- \nbuilding resources and services. These social benefits will lead to employment generation for \nthe  poor,  especially  through  the  development  of  technical  skills  among  women  project \nparticipants. Social benefits will also be derived through increased opportunities for education \nand health care, and improved nutritional status of families in general, and children and women \nin particular. Empowering the poor to demand and gain access to services and resources will be \na long-term benefit of the Project. The use of selection criteria that target poor areas for project \ninterventions will ensure that investments in the livestock subsector are directed to poorer areas \nof the northwestern region of the country. If during implementation it becomes apparent that \nindigenous  people  are  a  major  potential  beneficiary  group  in  some  of  the  new  project \nsubdistricts, then need-based strategies will be developed together with a detailed plan of action \nto address their specific needs.  \n \nD.  Gender and Development Issues \n60.  Women constitute 49.4% of the population in the project area, and 17.8% of the 2.9 \nmillion households are headed by females. The preparatory socioeconomic surveys indicate \nthat these households are often among the poorest in the project area. Over 70% of the female \npopulation is engaged in livestock rearing. Faced with the double impediments of a marginalized \nstatus in the family, community, and society, and lack of negotiating skills, women have had little \nor no real participation in decision making. The Project will provide opportunities to address \nthese concerns by (i) creating an enabling environment for women\u2019s participation at all stages of \nproject  planning  and  implementation;  (ii)  ensuring  that  project  benefits  reach  100%  of  the \nidentified  households,  particularly  those  with  female  heads;  (iii)  generating  employment \nopportunities for women by involving them not only in livestock rearing but also in marketing \nproducts and supply of inputs like feed; (iv) facilitating linkages of the women beneficiaries to \ndifferent support resources for sustainability of their livelihood; and (v) facilitating social and \neconomic empowerment through formation of women farmer groups to gain increased access to \nresources  and  participation  in  project  activities.  Women  will  also  be  supported  to  develop \nentrepreneurship skills and become entrepreneurs by establishing linkages with microfinance \ninstitutions, government agencies, and NGOs. They will also be trained to manage economic \nenterprises. The gender specialists in the NGOs will formulate specific strategies to address \ngender issues in the Project, including formation of small-scale joint ventures and mechanisms \nto generate home-based income activities for the older women in the households. A gender \naction plan is in Appendix 11. \n  ", "18  \nE.  Environmental Impacts \n \n61.  The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  indicated  that  the  high  population \npressure from both humans and livestock leads to some pollution of waterways and ponds. It \nwas found that none of the surveyed households had any waste treatment system, nor had they \nany precise understanding of the effects of a degraded environment. The Project will finance \nstall-feeding or tethered systems for larger animals and semiscavenging systems for poultry. \nThe by-products from these enterprises will be recycled as crop fertilizer, or used as domestic \nfuel. The Project will promote the use of biogas digesters to reduce dependence on dung for \nfuel. The Project will include education on environmental responsibilities and management in \nthe NGO and farmer training programs to develop community consciousness of environmental \nissues that will extend beyond the life of the Project. The design of markets, slaughter slabs, \nand milk treatment stations will include effective and environmentally sound waste and water \ndisposal systems. It is believed that the Project enterprise activities will have a minimal adverse \nimpact on the environment. The project training programs will significantly assist in developing \nbetter environment management practices in rural areas. Staff of the participating NGOs and \nthe PMU will monitor compliance with the conditions specified in the project environmental \nclearances,  with  the  periodic  assistance  of  an  environmental  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist. The summary IEE is in Appendix 12. \n \nF.  Risks \n62.  Compared with the PLDP, the Project\u2019s participatory planning approach will give the \nbeneficiaries flexibility in selecting enterprises and ensure that the individual makes the best \npossible choice. This feature will also allow participants to move away from investment areas \nthat become unprofitable or distorted by externalities such as unfair trade practices. Favorable \nproduct prices are needed to provide farmers with the expected financial benefits. The price \nassumptions used in the financial and economic analyses are conservative, and experience in \nthe PLDP indicates that the risk of adverse producer prices is minimal; most of the products are \nconsumed or marketed locally, with little outside competition at lower prices. Also, the growing \nconsumption levels of livestock products in Bangladesh indicate that household consumption \nand local market demand will readily dispose of the Project\u2019s incremental output without a \nsignificant  adverse  impact  on  producer  prices.  The  Government  will  take  all  necessary \nmeasures to mitigate the risk of the outbreak of livestock diseases, including the increased use \nof vaccines supplied by the private sector, the presence of CEWs to vaccinate animals, and \nimproved DLS disease diagnostic services. In the PLDP, not all of the funds allocated for credit \nwere used, not because of a lack of demand for credit (para. 12), but because NGOs recycled \nloans using funds originally borrowed from PKSF, and beneficiaries used savings. The risk of \nADB loan funds not being used in the Project has been mitigated because recycling of credit \nand the use of PKSF and NGOs\u2019 own resources were taken into account in designing the \nProject, with only $7.5 million being provided through the ADB loan for credit (Table A4.2)    \n \n63.  The Project will promote increased private sector production and delivery of inputs in the \nlivestock subsector. Government participation in such activities is being reduced in the PLDP. \nTo ensure that this process will continue and input subsidies will be eliminated, a specific \nassurance has been provided in this regard (Assurances, [xi]). DLS is committed to institutional \nreform (para. 31). In addition, because private firms already supply the majority of such inputs, \nfailure to eliminate the subsidies would not pose a threat to the successful implementation of the \nProject. \n \n ", "                                                                                        1   9                               \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, PKSF will establish a revolving fund, with \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB, for microfinance operations related to \nlivestock enterprises for poverty reduction under component 2 (a and b). \n(ii)  PKSF will require each participating NGO to provide its office in the project area \nwith (a) adequate staff, including an area manager and at least two program \norganizers (technical and microfinance); and (b) adequate logistic support to \nensure  that  the  area  office  is  able  to  support  the  participating  farmers  and \nentrepreneurs in their project investment activities. The NGO partners will be \nsupported to employ female extension workers, pursue gender-sensitive service \ndelivery mechanisms, and develop the capacity to address gender issues. \n(iii)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a project \nsteering committee jointly chaired by the secretaries of the Finance Division of \nMOF and MFL; core members will include representatives of the Economics \nRelations  Division  (ERD)  of  MOF,  the  Planning  Commission,  and  the \nImplementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  of  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning, and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. Other \nmembers will include the managing director of PKSF, the director general of \nDLS, and representatives of LGED, and participating NGOs.  \n(iv)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness  the  Government  will  establish  an \nimplementation coordination committee chaired by the deputy managing director \nof  PKSF  or  another  representative  of  PKSF;  core  members  will  include \nrepresentatives  of  the  ERD  and  Finance  Division  of  MOF,  the  Planning \nCommission, and IMED of the Ministry of Planning, DLS, LGED, and MFL; the \nLGED project coordinator; and the PMU project director. Indicative members will \ninclude representatives of participating NGOs and the PPSU. \n(v)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, PKSF will (a) select NGOs, satisfactory to \nADB, to deliver and manage the microfinance activities and training activities in \nthe  enterprise  development  component;  and  (b)  with  the  NGOs  enter  into \nagreements  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  document  the  flow,  accountability,  and \nrepayment  of  the  microfinance  activities,  and  implementation  of  the  training \nactivities in the enterprise development component. \n(vi)  The Government, through PKSF and DLS, will ensure that the requirements of \nthe gender action plan in Appendix 11 are met during project implementation. \n(vii)  PKSF  will  ensure  that  the  participating  NGOs  provide  social  development \ntraining,  including  awareness  raising,  group  management,  legal  rights, \ngovernance, health, and hygiene. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the approved 3-year and 10-year action plans \nto transform DLS into a facilitator and regulator of sector development, and a \npromoter of private sector development are implemented on schedule.   \n(ix)  If involuntary resettlement and land or asset acquisition are required for market \nconstruction, a resettlement plan will be prepared. LGED will publicly disclose the \nresettlement plan that  will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nResettlement.  The  resettlement  plan  will  include  a  complete  census  and \ninventory of losses.

Introduction \n1.  A team of independently recruited consultants will staff the project management unit \n(PMU) and assist the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) in implementing the Project. All \nconsultants must have extensive work experience in rural development projects in Bangladesh, \nand preferably also elsewhere. They must have previously worked in projects that have involved \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). Also, the PMU consultants selected must have lived and \nworked at field level and been involved in project implementation. A team of institutional change \nconsultants will assist the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) to transform itself into a \nfacilitator and regulator of subsector development. The consultants will have worked in their \nrespective areas of specialization in Bangladesh, or similar areas. \n \nB.  Implementation Consultants \n2.  The  PMU  implementation  consultants  (recruited  as  individuals)  will  provide \napproximately 400 domestic person-months of consulting services. The Project will fund an \nindependently recruited, professional PMU that will be staffed by a team of domestic specialists, \nrecruited as individuals including (i) a rural development specialist (project director);1 (ii) training \nand livestock improvement specialist; (iii) monitoring, evaluation and management information \nspecialist, and (iv) accountant. The PMU consultants will be selected by a committee composed \nof representatives of ADB, PKSF, and DLS, and will have experience in the listed disciplines, \nand be of international caliber. The PMU will be based in Rangpur in the project area at a site to \nbe mutually selected by PKSF and the implementing NGOs. The PMU will be responsible to \nPKSF. The PMU\u2019s tasks will include the following: \n \n(i)  Establish  and  equip  a  project  management  office,  recruit  the  relevant \nadministrative  and  supporting  staff,  and  develop  operational  systems  to \neffectively support project implementation at field level. \n(ii)  Develop an implementing coordination mechanism with the participating NGOs \nthat will facilitate the execution of project activities and provide a forum to resolve \nimplementation constraints. \n(iii)  Prepare a situation analysis format for the NGOs to record the essential baseline \ninformation in their individual operational areas. \n(iv)  Supervise the performance of the NGOs and provide guidance and assistance to \nimprove their organizational structures and their project delivery systems. \n(v)  Oversee the implementation of the gender action plan, environmental mitigation \nmeasures, and the participatory planning process. \n(vi)  Provide, through the team\u2019s subject matter specialists, technical assistance to the \nNGOs  and  the  target  households  during  implementation  of  the  enterprise \ndevelopment component. \n(vii)  Develop  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  process  and  reporting \nsystem that will allow the PMU and the participating NGOs to carry out effectively \nproject input monitoring and  benefit monitoring and evaluation, and assist the \nbeneficiaries with participatory monitoring and evaluation. \n                                                 \n1 A rural development specialist preferably with livestock experience is considered appropriate because of the \nproject\u2019s emphasis on community development, participatory processes, and delivery of microfinance to the \nbeneficiaries. ", "  Appendix  8  35 \n(viii)  Design applied research projects from topics that have been identified by the \nNGOs and the beneficiaries. \n(ix)  Supervise and monitor the effective implementation of the Project\u2019s gender action \nplan at all levels. \n(x)  Prepare annual implementation targets and activities based on the information \nderived by the NGOs through their participatory planning interaction with the \ntarget beneficiaries. \n(xi)  Prepare the quarterly, annual, monitoring and evaluation, midterm, and project \ncompletion reports that will allow PKSF, DLS, and ADB to accurately assess \nproject\u2019s implementation progress, outputs, and any requirements for redesign or \nfurther development of the components. \n \nC.  Institutional Change Consultants \n3.  In addition to the PMU consultants, the Danish International Development Assistance \n(Danida) and Asian Development Bank will finance an institutional change team recruited from \nfirms to support DLS staff skills development in essential areas, as specified in the 3, 5, and 10-\nyear action plans for DLS\u2019s future development. Approximately 145 person-months will be \nrequired:  43  international  and  102  domestic.  Indicative  specialists  will  include  international \nconsultants with expertise in (i) management of change processes, (ii) institutional development, \n(iii) legal issues, (iv) disease monitoring systems, (v) veterinary public health monitoring and \ncontrol  systems,  (vi)  livestock  sector  quality  assurance  systems,  and  (vii)  management \ninformation  systems.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  required  with  specialization  in  (i) \nmanagement of change processes (full-time team leader), (ii) organization development, (iii) \nhuman  resources  development,  (iv)  livestock  information  systems,  (v)  disease  monitoring \nsystems,  (vi)  veterinary  public  health  monitoring  and  control  systems,  (vii)  livestock sector \nquality assurance systems, and (viii) management information systems.  \n \n4.  The consultants will assist DLS in achieving the long-term objectives of the 10-year \naction plan for institutional change. First, the consultants will support DLS in achieving the \ndevelopment  objective  of  the  3-year  action  plan,  which  is  to  develop  a  cost-effective \norganization, with an empowered change management team; a new organizational structure; \ntrained, motivated, and competent staff; and all management and professional systems in place, \nwhich can implement the vision and mission of the DLS to create, promote, and regulate an \nenabling environment for the subsector. This support will focus on achieving the following \noutputs in the 3-year action plan: \n \n(i)  an effective change management process that ensures that the proposed action \nplan  is  implemented  in  a  cost-effective  manner,  addresses  all  risks  and \nconstraints, and utilizes possible synergies and momentum created externally to \nthe subsector; \n(ii)  organizational  development  leading  to  a  cost-effective  organization  that  can \nimplement the vision and mission of the DLS to create, promote, and regulate an \nenabling environment for the subsector; \n(iii)  human  resources  development  resulting  in  a  human  resources  development \nsystem that enhances the continuous development of adequately skilled and \nmotivated staff; \n(iv)  a  livestock  information  system  and  database  that  provides  easy  access  to \ninformation needed for cost-effective development of the livestock subsector for \nall stakeholders; ", "36  Appendix 8 \n(v)  a disease monitoring system that in a cost-effective manner will reduce mortality \nand  morbidity,  and  make  livestock  development  less  risky  and  hence  more \nprofitable for rural households; \n(vi)  a veterinary public health monitoring and control system that in a cost-effective \nmanner  reduces  diseases  transmitted  from  animals  to  humans,  and  makes \nconsumption of animal products and by-products safer for humans; \n(vii)  a livestock subsector quality assurance system that will ensure that private sector \ndevelopment  takes  place  in  a  regulated  manner  and  that  rural  households \nreceive quality services in an accountable and transparent manner characterized \nby competition and consumer choice; and \n(viii)  a DLS management information system that will facilitate the transformation of \nDLS into a learning institution that continuously improves its performance through \na trial-and-error institutional development process. \n \n   \n ", "  Appendix  9  37 \nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Project is justified on both efficiency and equity grounds. The need for the Project \narises  from  the  undersupply  of  community  development  services  in  the  project  area  and \nunderinvestment in microfinance delivery services. These deficiencies will largely be addressed \nby providing training and support services to local people to improve their ability to access the \nresources\u2013both physical and financial\u2013required for income improvement. Enhancing the human \nand social capital of beneficiaries, will help in addressing equity issues by ensuring that the \nneeds  of  the  ultrapoor  are  explicitly  recognized  and  appropriate  development  alternatives \noffered to them. In addition, the Project will enhance the ability of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) to provide microfinance and support services to the beneficiaries. \n \n2.  While in recent years Bangladesh has considerably reduced the incidence of poverty, \nnot all poor groups, particularly those in isolated rural areas, have benefited equally. The Project \nwill go some way to addressing this deficiency.  \n \nB.  Rationale \n \n3.  While the principal objective of the Project is poverty reduction in the broadest sense, \nthe main measure of the success of its activities is changes in household incomes. Toward this \nend, the main project activities proposed are (i) development of the capacity of community \nleaders,  beneficiaries,  and  providers  of  support  services;  (ii)  technical,  microfinance,  and \ninfrastructure support for both on- and off-farm activities; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of \nsupport institutions such as NGOs and the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) to deliver \nservices. \n \n4.  The analysis that follows focuses on quantifiable benefits at the household level and \ndescribes nonquantifiable benefits in a qualitative manner. As the output from project-financed \nactivities will largely be determined by a demand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the likely \nmix and scale of outputs. Furthermore, it has not been possible to quantify the long-term \nbenefits of the human capital development activities to be undertaken as part of the community \nand capacity development components; neither has it been possible to quantify the outcome of \nthe proposed innovation and ultrapoor activities. Therefore, a full benefit-cost analysis for the \noverall project was considered impractical. \n \nC.  Beneficiaries \n \n5.  Communities to be targeted by the Project are in 20 districts in northwest Bangladesh, \nmainly in Rajshahi division.1 The districts have a population of about 27 million, including 6 \nmillion nonurban households. The target is approximately 660,000 families out the 2.9 million \nhouseholds in the rural subdistricts covered by the Project. The Project will reach about 31% of \nthe poverty-afflicted households in the subdistricts (poverty incidence is estimated at about 72% \nin the project area). The indicative figure of 660,000 families is made up of 360,000 families \nfrom districts and subdistricts previously covered by the Participatory Livestock Development \nProject (PLDP, [17 districts and 89 subdistricts]) and 300,000 families from new areas (46 \n                                                 \n1 The districts are Bogra, Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Joypurhat, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Mymensingh, Naogaon, \nNatore, Nawabganj, Netrokona, Nilphamari, Pabna, Panchagarh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sherpur, Sirajganj, and \nThakuragaon.  ", "38  Appendix 9 \nsubdistricts in 3 new districts, and 22 new subdistricts in the 17 PLDP districts). The families in \nthe PLDP area will mostly be families previously not included in the PLDP activities, those who \nwant to move from poultry production into other livestock enterprises, or those wanting to enter \ninto processing and marketing activities. Therefore, all enterprises will be new, and all inputs \nand outputs will be incremental. These areas have been chosen because of their poverty and \npotential for livestock development. \n \n6.  In  total,  project  resources,  including  complementary  infrastructure  investments,  will \nenable between 300,000 and 320,000 households to participate, including an estimated 5,000 \nhouseholds in the ultrapoor category. Actual beneficiary numbers will be determined in part by \nthe outcome of a range of project-supported activities including community capacity building, \ninfrastructure construction, land and other asset allocation, and marketing initiatives. A 6-year \nimplementation period is proposed. \n \nD.  Financial and Institutional Incentives for Stakeholder Participation \n  1.  Livestock Production Enterprises \n \n7.  The  Project  envisages  two  broad  categories  of  livestock  production  enterprises:  (i) \npoultry including ducks; and (ii) other livestock including calf fattening, goat rearing, and milk \nproduction. Participating NGOs will offer a menu of enterprises from which beneficiaries can \nchoose. Beneficiary perceptions of the likely returns, and their ability to manage and finance the \nenterprise will be important factors in enterprise selection and in determining the eventual mix of \nenterprises. Based on the experience of the PLDP, it is likely that poultry production, following \nthe established key rearer model, will be the most popular enterprise. For most beneficiaries, \nthis will be a new household enterprise, which will utilize food scraps, nearby scavenging \nresources,  and  purchased  feeds.  Financial  models  were  prepared  for  eight  enterprises  to \ndetermine  the  likely  impact  of  the  eight  on  household  incomes  and  to  estimate  financing \nrequirements. The models are representative of the main livestock production and support \nenterprises found in the project area. Key financial indicators for the enterprises in Table A9.

A typical poultry key rearer will start with about six chickens of an \nadapted local breed or crossbreed and six chickens of an improved breed, and will maintain this \nflock size through the purchase or rearing of replacement pullets. Beneficiaries adopting a more \nspecialized egg production model will run flocks of about 36 hybrid birds. Broiler production will \nbe based on about 5,200 broilers every 4 months. Chick rearers with about 400 chicks per batch \nwill support the activities of the main poultry production enterprises. Although not specifically \nmodeled, there will be scope for establishing small hatcheries and units producing eggs for \nhatching.  Duck  rearers  will  handle  flocks  of  about  50  birds,  which  will  be  reared  as \nsemiscavengers.  \n \n9.  Other Production Enterprises. Two head will be fattened in a typical beef enterprise. \nMost beneficiaries wishing to produce goats will follow a model in which does are kept for 2 \nyears before being sold and replacements bought. In view of the large investment required, \nmost milk-producing enterprises are likely to be limited to one crossbred dairy cow although \nthere are likely to be other units that use local breeds in a more extensive model. \n \n10.  Support Enterprises. Support enterprises are likely to include poultry workers and feed \nsellers. Estimated margins for these enterprises are also shown in Table A9. Poultry workers \nwill provide vaccination services and limited technical advice to poultry and goat producers. \nFeed  sellers  will  establish  village-based  businesses  to  supply  feed  to  producers.  These \nenterprises have been successful in the PLDP. Egg sellers, who will collect eggs from small ", "40  Appendix 9 \nproducers for wholesaling, will also be financed under the Project if there is a demand for this \nenterprise type. \n \n  2.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n \n11.  Annual enterprise financial margins before debt service range from about Tk1,885 ($32) \nfor goat production to about Tk19,810 ($339) for broiler production (Table A9). Assuming an \naverage household size of 3.65 persons, annual per capita increments range from Tk516 \n($8.80) to Tk5,425 ($92.70). With the exception of the goat production enterprise, returns to \nlabor all exceed the current financial opportunity cost of labor in the project area, which ranges \nfrom Tk40 to Tk55 per day depending on season and class of labor. Prices and conversion \nfactors used in the analysis are shown in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n12.  Enterprise margins are also shown in Table A9 in economic prices using the domestic \nprice numeraire, and with the value of household labor included at its economic opportunity \ncost. All margins are positive under these assumptions. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for the milk production enterprise was estimated at 8%. At this level of return, investment \nin milk production does not appear to be economically viable; however, the \u201cworld\u201d prices used \nin the analysis are exceptionally low because of highly subsidized producer prices in developed \ncountries. For this reason, countervailing duties and taxes are imposed on milk imports to \nprotect domestic commercial milk producers. The EIRR is also low because of the economic \ncost  of  labor,  which  is  not  valued  in  the  financial  analysis.  Milk  production  is,  however, \nfinancially attractive particularly to small-scale individual entrepreneurs, primarily because they \nare producing for highly localized markets that do not compete with imported milk (para. 21).  \n \n3.  Stakeholder Incentives to Participate \n13.  The Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) as Executing Agency has performed very \nwell in managing projects funded by other development partners, and in the PLDP. It has \ndemonstrated a high degree of commitment and efficiency in achieving project development \nobjectives. In PLDP II, the project management unit (PMU) will be totally accountable to PKSF. \nIn essence, project implementation effectiveness will be the responsibility of PKSF, through the \nPMU, and participating NGOs. PKSF, DLS, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will select \nthe  PMU  staff  from  a  pool  of  competent,  independent  professionals  to  ensure  that  well-\nremunerated, high quality individuals with proven track records staff the PMU. DLS will also \nprovide  specialist  technical  staff  to  the  PMU.  The  project  steering  committee,  and  the \nimplementation coordination committee, which will be chaired by PKSF, will ensure effective \ncoordination among the stakeholders. DLS is committed to a 10-year action plan of institutional \nchange to transform itself into a facilitator and regulator of sector development, a promoter of \nprivate sector development, and a cost-effective provider of public goods services where market \nand nonmarket failures exist. The Project and Danish International Development Assistance \n(Danida)  will  support  DLS  in  implementing  the  initial  3-year  action  plan  for  change.  DLS \nparticipation in the Project is supported by a substantial capacity-building component, including \nconstruction of 27 subdistrict livestock development centers to assist DLS in supporting project \nactivities at the field level. The Project will also support DLS to play an active role at the field \nlevel in supporting community extension workers to deliver services for basic animal health, \ndisease diagnosis and control, and production from livestock service centers operating at the \nunion council level. The community extension workers will be key actors in the livestock centers, \nsupported by the NGOs, and subdistrict DLS staff who will provide specialist disease diagnosis \nas required. Participating NGOs will receive microfinance from PKSF, with a sufficient margin to \ncover their administrative costs. For NGOs working in new subdistricts, the Project will provide ", "  Appendix  9  41 \ninitial  administrative  support  for  staff  salaries  and  equipment  and  vehicles.  Beneficiary \nincentives to participate in the Project are indicated in other sections of this appendix.  \n \nE.  Financing of Enterprise Development \n \n14.  Microfinance programs have substantially grown in recent years. However, coverage by \nmicrofinance NGOs in rural Bangladesh is still inadequate, reaching only 50% of the 10 million \nrural poor. NGO activities tend to be concentrated in more accessible areas close to subdistrict \nheadquarters and other urban centers. The PLDP attempted to extend microfinance coverage to \nthe poor who did not previously have access to microfinance services. The achievements of the \nPLDP and past projects demonstrate opportunities to expand further livestock development to \ninclude a wider range of production and input supply enterprises. In the PLDP, by 30 June 2003, \n265,000 beneficiaries had borrowed about $36 million, with almost a 100% repayment, to \nfinance livestock production enterprises. Some beneficiaries borrowed multiple times, indicating \nwillingness on the part of the poor to borrow funds to invest in livestock production. As NGOs \nunder  the  proposed  Project  become  more  experienced,  they  can  offer  a  more  diversified \ninvestment program that would include beef, dairy, and goat enterprises; small-scale product \nprocessing units; and input supply services. Prospective beneficiaries have shown interest in \ninvesting  in  such  enterprises.  The  project  design  has  taken  into  account  the  existing \nmicrofinance  resources  of  PKSF  and  participating  NGOs,  and  the  fact  that  the  PLDP \nmicrofinance funds will continue to be utilized in PLDP II. Accordingly, ADB will provide only \n$7.5 million (21%) of the Project\u2019s total estimated microfinance requirement of $35.8 million. \nPKSF will provide $15.3 million (43%) from its own resources; NGOs will provide $10.9 million \n(30%), and beneficiaries $2.1 million from their savings (6%). These financing arrangements are \nexpected to contribute to the long-term expansion of coverage and sustainability of microfinance \nactivities in the project area. \n \n15.  Enterprise development will be financed through loans to be provided by participating \nNGOs. While indicative loan amounts for each enterprise are shown in Table A9, NGOs will set \nindividual loan limits within their overall lending policies. Most loans will have a 1-year term. For \ngoat production, however, a 2-year term is envisaged with a 3-4 year term for milk production. \nInitial loans will finance fixed investments such as animal shelters and equipment, livestock, and \nsome inputs. Subsequent loans will provide seasonal finance for livestock and inputs. A flat \ninterest rate of 15% has been assumed for the debt servicing estimates. \n \n16.  Equity contributions of the beneficiaries will be determined by NGOs as part of their loan \nevaluation  procedures.  The  financing  plans  indicate  that  beneficiary  contributions  of  up  to \nTk1,000 may be required for some enterprises. Financing of the key rearer poultry model, which \nis likely to be the most widely adopted, should be feasible, however, with minimal beneficiary \nequity. For dairying, the financing plan indicates that household equity contributions of up to \nTk15,000  may  be  required  in  total  over  the  first  3  years  of  the  enterprise.  Few  potential \nbeneficiaries are likely to be able to contribute this amount.  \n \nF.  Impact on Beneficiaries \n \n17.  Participatory rural appraisal data from 47 villages surveyed during the poverty and social \nanalysis study carried out as part of project preparation indicate that, in the project area, over \n80% of rural households fall into the income categories of very poor, poor or marginal. These \nhouseholds will be the primary targets of the project. Data from the more detailed concurrent \nhousehold survey carried out during the study show that annual household income from all \nsources reported by respondents in the three categories was Tk16,254 ($278) or about Tk4,450 ", "42  Appendix 9 \n($76) per capita.1 More specifically, households in the very poor category reported incomes of \nonly Tk10,636 ($182). These households, together with households headed by women and \ngenerally categorized as being very poor, comprised over 25% of households surveyed during \nthe participatory rural appraisal. \n \n18.  Table A9 shows the estimated annual margin for a poultry key rearer enterprise, for \nexample, to be Tk3,296 ($56). Adoption of such an enterprise would have a significant impact \non beneficiary incomes\u2013a rise of 20% on average for those in the very poor, poor, or marginal \ncategories or, more specifically, over 30% for those in very poor households and households \nheaded by women. In total, the Project is expected to reach at least 250,000 households, \ncomprising over 900,000 persons, in the very poor, poor, or marginal categories, or about 10% \nof persons in farm households in the project area. Up to 50,000 more beneficiaries are expected \nto adopt a range of more capital-intensive enterprises. Hybrid layers, broilers, and dairying fall \ninto this category. While these have the potential to make larger impacts on incomes, they may \nbe beyond the immediate reach of the very poor and poor because of their financing and, \npossibly, marketing requirements. They are more likely to be adopted by households in the \nupper end of the marginal/small category.  \n \nG.  Markets for Project Outputs \n \n19.  During 1995\u20132000, consumption of dairy products, meat, and eggs was estimated to \nhave grown at an annual average rate of 2.7%, 4.3%, and 7.7%, respectively. Nominal prices in \nretail markets all rose over a similar period. Increased consumption was largely driven by higher \ndisposable incomes, with per capita income growing by nearly 4% per year during the second \nhalf of the 1990s. Income changes have been translated into increased consumption through \nhigh income elasticities of demand2 for livestock products. In addition, an increased share of \nhousehold budgets has been allocated to livestock and non-cereal products at the expense of \ncereals. If income growth can be sustained, there is no reason why consumption growth should \nnot continue at recent rates, especially given the existing low levels of per capita consumption. \nIn addition, localized markets for livestock products exist in northwest Bangladesh, and in the \nPLDP, surplus production generated by the project beneficiaries was readily marketed. The \nbeneficiaries consumed approximately 33% of the incremental production to improve family \nnutrition levels. This trend is expected to continue in the proposed Project. \n \n20.  On  the  supply  side,  there  has  been  strong  growth  in  recent  years  in  large-scale \nproduction of eggs and broilers around the main urban centers. Small-scale producers, such as \nthose to be financed under the project, have so far been able to compete with these more \ncapital-intensive enterprises. Low labor costs and, in the view of many consumers, the attraction \nof  locally  produced  and  marketed  products  have  helped  in  this  regard.  As  the  scale  of \ncommercial production expands, however, and as internal transportation costs fall as roads are \nimproved, smaller producers are likely to come under increased price pressure. Furthermore, in \nsome parts of the project area, there will from time to time be competition from eggs crossing \nthe  border  from  India.  NGOs  involved  in  project  implementation  will  need  to  maintain  a \ncontinuing watch on price trends so that lending programs can be adjusted accordingly. \n \n21.  The national and local dairy industry should be monitored closely. Milk powder and other \ndairy product imports are currently highly protected, with duties and taxes adding about 90% to \nborder prices. Any reduction in this level of protection would depress local procurement prices. \n                                                 \n1 Average household size of those surveyed in the project area was 3.65 persons.  \n2 These have been estimated as 1.35 for milk, 1.23 for meat, and 2.00 for eggs. ", "  Appendix  9  43 \nThe extent to which prices fall would depend, in part, however, on changes in world prices for \ndairy products that could result from broader trade liberalization. Lending for dairy development \nwill need to reflect the reality that protection levels may be reduced as part of an ongoing \nprogram  of  trade  policy  reform.  Nonetheless,  the  Bangladesh  Milk  Producer\u2019s  Cooperative \nUnion (Milk Vita) is active in the proposed project area and provides small producers with \nregular, guaranteed market access to a localized market not affected by commercial production \nand imports. The project interventions to promote milk chilling and processing will also expand \nthe available outlets demanding milk. Therefore, it is expected that smallholder farmers will be \nable to sell their surplus milk production in local markets, in addition to increasing family milk \nconsumption. \n \nH.  Nonquantified Benefits \n22.  The Project will generate a range of nonquantified benefits. Community capacity-building \ninitiatives are expected to improve the overall development capacity of communities and assist \nwith  forming  groups  to  support  livestock  development.  The  increased  number  of  NGO \nmicrofinance offices to be financed under the Project will, in the long term, facilitate access to \nmicrofinance for a large number of people who would not otherwise be able to borrow. Training \nfor NGO and DLS staff will have a continuing benefit beyond the life of the Project. Initiatives to \nassist the ultrapoor are also likely to have long-term benefits through reduced health care costs, \nimproved  education  levels,  and  reduced  dependency.  A  significant  increase  in  beneficiary \nnutritional levels has not been quantified. The Project will also have environmental benefits such \nas manure from cattle and poultry, which is used as fertilizer and domestic fuel in rural areas. \n \nI.  Subsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project \n \n23.  Under the action plan to commercialize input supplies, DLS will phase out the remaining \nsubsidies on livestock products produced by DLS to achieve deregulated prices by 30 June \n2005, and will provide advisory support to participating NGOs. Otherwise, the recurrent budget \nimplications of the Project for government are minimal. ", "44  Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector Identified as a National Priority in Country  Sector identified as a National Priority in Country \nPoverty Analysis                             Yes  Poverty Partnership Agreement   Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n  \nAlthough gains in reducing poverty, have been achieved over the years close to half the population still live \nbelow the poverty line. In 2000, 49.8% of the country\u2019s population was below the upper poverty line, \ncompared with 58.8% in 1991/92. In 2000, the head count rate (upper poverty line) for the urban poor \ndeclined to 36.6%. Over the same period, rural poverty dropped to 53% from 61.2%. The differences in the \nnature of poverty between the various categories of poor (taking into account the needs of the ultrapoor) \nhave so far not received adequate attention in government programs. Blanket targeting of social policies for \nthe poor has been coupled with insufficient recognition of the need to develop all groups and categories of \nthe poor as the basis for sustainable rural development. Furthermore, the country is regularly subject to \nflooding, which causes large-scale damage to crops, livestock, and infrastructure, with riverbank erosion as \na major factor contributing to rural poverty.  \n \nRecognition  by  the  government  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  of  small-scale  livestock \nproduction as a vehicle for augmenting cash income and improving household welfare in poor rural \ncommunities has gained impetus in recent years. The poor, especially women (more specifically the \ndisadvantaged such as female\u2013heads of households, widows, and abandoned women), ethnic, and other \nminority groups can be readily targeted through livestock-based programs to increase their income and \nimprove family nutrition. \n \nIdentifying the subsector as a national priority in the Asian Development Bank country poverty analysis and \nthe resulting partnership agreement on poverty reduction are the first steps toward the implementation of \nbetter  balanced  projects  specifically  focusing  on  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  Project  itself  will  be \ninstrumental in contributing significantly to poverty reduction in the selected districts and subdistricts. The \nProject  will  also  contribute  to  community  development,  improvements  in  the  delivery  systems  to \nparticipants, and environmental improvement. \n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                  Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \nTo prepare a detailed and multidimensional project, poverty analysis will be required. The household \nincome and expenditure survey of 2002 does not contain detailed district-level data. Hence, the Project will \ncollect in-depth socioeconomic and poverty-related data for each of the proposed districts and present \nthem in a baseline report at the beginning of the Project. The data will include income and expenditure, \ndemographic trends, gender issues, issues of ethnic and minority groups, nutritional status of the proposed \ntarget population, child labor, and the environment in each district. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of \npoverty at economic (income) and noneconomic (non-income) levels will be conducted. At the same time \nthe causes (real and perceived), manifestations, and outcomes of poverty will be identified and will \ninfluence project implementation.  \n \nIdentifying stakeholders and confirming the suitability of selected project areas will involve rapid rural \nappraisal  and  participatory  rapid  assessment  techniques  such  as  poverty  profiles,  combined  with \nparticipatory planning strategies and methodologies. Detailed poverty and social analysis will identify \nconstraints and barriers affecting women and the poor. There is a need to focus on the development of \nsustainable, cost-effective, and socially supported delivery systems with appropriate targeting and eligibility \ncriteria and a clear mandate for transparency and effective monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  use  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  baseline  surveys  in  analyzing  the  poverty \nimplications of work programs and will monitor progress through two other (midproject and end-of-project) ", "  Appendix  10  45 \ndistrict-wide surveys. Participating NGOs will obtain baseline information on beneficiaries and monitor their \nprogress  in  terms  of  asset  creation,  family  incomes,  and  nutrition.  The  progress  of  farmer-level \norganizations as a means of social mobilization and interaction with the lower levels of government \nadministration will also be monitored. \n \nIdentifying constraints and barriers (both internal and external) and possible feasible positive actions for \nmaximizing project objectives will be given significant consideration. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nThe Project will use a highly participatory process. It will conduct initial field consultations using rapid rural \nappraisal and participatory rapid assessment techniques to conduct baseline surveys and gender analyses, \nidentify key beneficiary groups and stakeholders, and initiate social mobilization.   \n \nCommunity mobilization activities will use participatory approaches involving all relevant stakeholders. The \nparticipants will include the disadvantaged (ethnic and minority groups) and women to identify the most \nappropriate project services and make them available. Project activities are intended to be needs based \nand community supported. \n \nThe Project will identify the need for and special approaches required for the full participation of women and \nmarginalized people, including the ultrapoor, minority, and indigenous people. These groups will participate \nin assessing the degree of poverty among women and men; identifying ways to reduce their poverty; and \nexamining issues in the livestock subsector including the need for training, marketing, and other linkages \nand services. Macrolevel issues will also be identified through consultation with all categories and levels of \nstakeholders.  \n \nNGOs  will  participate  as  key  stakeholders  in  delivering  services  at  the  field  level  and  ensuring  a \nparticipatory process throughout the life of the Project. A participatory operational mechanism will be \ndeveloped to involve all categories of stakeholders (project beneficiaries, participating NGOs, government \nline agencies, local administrations, and development partners) in implementing and monitoring, and to \nkeep them informed of project achievements, innovations, and issues.  \n \nBeneficiary groups will be encouraged to participate in group activities that, as they consolidate their \nactivities, would grow into associations that undertake a wider role of developing input-output linkages and \nresolve larger community-based issues. Their representation on community coordination committees will be \nsought as a means of obtaining feedback on project activities. Committees comprising participating NGOs \nand cooperating line agencies would meet regularly with project staff to identify and resolve implementation \nissues, and achievements and innovations that can be replicated periodically at the subdistrict level.  The \nimplementing agency will carry out periodic reviews with the NGO partners. Special working groups will \nwork with project staff on key issues. Such events will be designed to ensure a sense of ownership and \nsustainability of the Project, and monitor milestones in project progress. Through information sharing, \nconsultation, shared decision making, and shared responsibility and control of project implementation, the \nroles and functions of the stakeholders will be identified and strengthened.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women: \n \nThe overall objective of the Project is poverty reduction, and it will specifically address the gender aspects \nof poverty among the rural population. It will seek to improve the living standards of the population, \nespecially of women and households headed by women with a view to significantly reduce gender disparity \nin in economic activities. \n \nTo maximize the impact on women, baseline studies will identify specific needs of women, strategies, and ", "46  Appendix 10 \nmechanisms for addressing such needs in the operation of each project component and their monitoring. \nWomen will form the majority of the beneficiaries for enterprise development and will be supported with \nmicrofinance, adequate training, and marketing linkages. The NGO partners will ensure empowerment of \nwomen by organizing them in groups, creating opportunities for income generation and asset development, \ndeveloping leadership skills, familiarizing them with their rights, and creating awareness of their social \nresponsibilities. Women from among the ultrapoor group will be supported to undertake asset development \nactivities. Special activities will  be initiated to develop entrepreneurial traits, management skills, and \nlivestock-related simple technical knowledge among women.  \n \nThe NGOs will recruit women as agents to ensure that they are involved and participate at all levels of \nproject implementation. Women will also be developed as livestock service providers at the community \nlevel. The services of a gender specialist will be sought to ensure that gender concerns are addressed in \nimplementing all the project components.    \n \nOutput Prepared:  \n                                                                                                                                  \nA gender action plan was prepared to systematically deliver project benefits to women in line with the \ncountry\u2019s policy on gender and development and the national priority of poverty reduction and women\u2019s \nempowerment. \n \nE.

The proposed Project will implement a time-bound gender action plan and will address \ngender concerns in all four project components. The main activities will relate to enhancing \nwomen\u2019s capacity to increase their involvement and incomes in the livestock sector so that the \nProject can contribute in achieving the Government\u2019s and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s goal of \npoverty reduction.  \n \n2.  To realize this long-term goal, the proposed Project will : \n(i)  ensure that the Project addresses the gender aspects of poverty reduction \nthrough  the  project  components:  community  development,  livestock \nenterprise  development,  pilot  program  for  the  ultrapoor,  innovative  and \napplied research, institutional capacity building of the implementing agencies, \nand monitoring; \n(ii)  create an enabling environment for women\u2019s participation in the livestock \nsector and support the government in addressing gender concerns of the \nsector while working for poverty reduction; \n(iii)  give women access to resources and inputs (microfinance, information and \ntraining, livestock support services such as veterinary services and artificial \ninsemination  services),  and  enhance  their  income  and  capacity  to  utilize \nincreased resources effectively and efficiently; and \n(i)  enhance women\u2019s capability to access markets and available resources for a \nsustainable livelihood. \n \n3.

This Summary Initial Environmental Examination (SIEE) records the major findings of an \nexamination of the environmental impacts that may result from intervention activities proposed \nunder the Project. Information gathered during field visits and stakeholder consultations, and \nfrom a review of reports pertinent to the Project formed the basis for the SIEE. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The  Project  will  carry  out  development  activities  in  20  districts  in  northwestern \nBangladesh.  It  will  (i)  improve  community  capabilities  to  develop  and  manage  income- \ngenerating activities through a technical and social development training program, (ii) provide \nmicrofinance and technical supporting services for rural enterprise development, (iii) assist the \nultrapoor through a pilot program of asset development and training, (iv) build the capacity of \nthe  Department  of  Livestock  Services,  and    (v)  support  the  Project\u2019s  implementing  and \nmanagement agencies. The total project area will cover 157 subdistricts in 20 districts; 68 of \nthese  subdistricts  and  3  districts  are  areas  that  have  not  received  assistance  under  the \nParticipatory Livestock Development Project.1 \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  Water Resources. Flowing rivers and standing water bodies constitute the surface \nwater resources of the project area. The rivers and tributaries cover about 14% of the project \narea. Water pollution problems are not apparent. \n \n4.  Ecological and Cultural Resources. The project area had rich flora in the past. But \nwith the passage of time, much of the forest has disappeared as a result of the expansion of \nagriculture and human settlements. The project districts are fairly wooded and many valuable \nforest trees are indigenous. The trees are used as timber and fuelwood. Clumps of bamboo are \nvery common and are found in every homestead forest. A large variety of medicinal plants are \nalso present.  \n \n5.  Large mammals like tigers, elephants, gangetic dolphins, and wild boars were widely \ndistributed in the past, but have almost completely disappeared. Other mammals like jackals, \nfoxes, large Indian civets, otters, Bengal mongooses, and squirrels still occur, but their numbers \nare rapidly dwindling. Almost all varieties of birds found in Bangladesh are also common in the \nproject area.  \n \n6.  There are places of aesthetic, historical, religious, cultural, and archeological value in the \nproject  area.  Like  the  natural  forest  and  watersheds,  they  are  protected  under  the \nEnvironmental Conservation Act. There are no environmentally sensitive areas in the project \ndistricts.     \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Participatory Livestock Development Project. Manila. ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environment Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n7.  A masterscreening checklist drawn up for agricultural projects in Bangladesh identified \nsignificant impacts (both positive and negative) and eliminated insignificant ones. An impact \nmatrix was constructed using the checklist and is included in Supplementary Appendix I. A \nchecklist  identifying  significant  potential  project  impacts  was  produced.  Of  all  the  project \ncomponents, only the enterprise development component has potential impacts. The impacts \nare outlined in paras. 8\u201311, with the appropriate mitigation and enhancement measures. \n \n8.  Management  of  Polluting  Wastes.  Wastes  from  farm  activitities  using  veterinary \nvaccines and medicines, and chemical fertilizers are likely to create some pollution problem in \nthe natural environment, including water, soil, and ambient air around the farms. Residual \nchemicals from vaccines and medicines can possibly accumulate and ultimately affect human \nas well as animal health by entering into the food chain. Training beneficiaries on careful \nhandling of polluting wastes can mitigate this potentially adverse impact.  \n \n9.  Treatment of Organic Wastes. All solid and liquid wastes generated on farms , contain \norganic pollutants. These are likely to be converted into organic fertilizer products, or neutralized \nby natural processes. The effluents either may create dissolved oxygen deficiency in water \nbodies and affect aquatic lives particularly fish, or may contaminate the soil. The best option for \nmitigating organic pollution is to construct biogas plants and use both solid and liquid wastes as \nraw material for producing energy in the form of biogas. However, this option is economically \nfeasible only for farms with more than 250 chickens, or 10 cattle. Alternatively, the generated \nsolid wastes can be used in preparing compost for use as organic fertilizer, and the effluents \ncan be neutralized through lagoon treatment in earthen ponds. Farmers generally use solid \nwastes as cooking fuel; however, they are generally less familiar with composting techniques. \nImplementation  of  a  program  for  making  compost  will  require  some  technical  training  and \nassistance from either an experienced nongovernment organization (NGO) or the Department of \nAgriculture. \n \n10.  Besides mitigating the impacts arising from organic waste disposal from existing farms, \nthe marketing and small business development subcomponent of the Project will promote the \nconstruction of chilling, pasteurizing and packaging units, and slaughter slabs in livestock-\nowning communities. The design of markets, slaughter slabs, and milk treatment stations will \ninclude effective and environmentally sound waste and water disposal systems. Wastes (such \nas blood and intestinal contents) generated from slaughterhouses should produce no noticeable \nnegative impact on the environment, or health; rather the impact is expected to be positive. \nFishermen collect blood as fish feed, and the poor use intestinal contents as fuel and fertilizer.      \n \n11.  Increased Forage and Fodder Production and Soil Conditioning. Increased forage \nproduction and establishment of leguminous fodder trees in farm areas, along roadsides, and \nfodder production pockets will help increase soil nitrogen and improve soil fertility and organic \nmatter. This impact is positive; hence no mitigation will be required. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n12.  National procedures for environmental assessment in Bangladesh are outlined in the \nEnvironmental Conservation Act of 1995 and the Environmental Conservation Rules of 1997. \nNecessary environmental clearances will be obtained from the Department of Environment, \nwhich is the national environmental technical and regulatory agency. The conditions laid down \nin the clearances including compliance with national environmental quality standards will have ", "52  Appendix 12 \nto  be  fulfilled.  Also,  coordination  with  the  department  will  be  maintained  during  project \nimplementation. Staff of the participating NGOs and the project management unit will monitor \ncompliance with the conditions specified in the clearances, with the periodic assistance of an \nenvironmental monitoring and evaluation specialist. \n \n13.  The field survey for the initial environmental examination (IEE) clearly indicated that \nfarmers (i) are not familiar with the country\u2019s environmental policy and legislation; (ii) have poor \nknowledge regarding the safe handling and health effects of veterinary medicines; (iii) do not \nhave adequate knowledge of preparing cattle and poultry feeds using local raw materials; and \n(iv)  manage  farm-generated  solid  and  liquid  wastes  unproductively,  when  they  have  the \npotential to produce energy and soil nutrients. To assist the farmers to produce and sustain \nlivestock of high economic potential, farmer training is needed on these topics: (i) environmental \npolicy and legislation in Bangladesh, (ii) the safe handling and disposal of used vaccines and \nmedicines, and (iii) preparing poultry and cattle feed. Project and NGO staff will be given \ntraining-of-trainer  courses  on  environmental  awareness  to  raise  farmer  awareness  of \nenvironmental issues, before delivering such courses to the farmers. NGOs will also offer \nspecific courses for project beneficiaries. \n \n14.  The environmental impact analysis shows that none of the environmental components \nhave a high negative impact caused by the project interventions. Since there are few adverse \nimpacts, an extensive monitoring program is not required. However, the project management \nunit  with  the  assistance  of  an  impact  assessment  specialist  as  part  of  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental monitoring program  periodically checks and monitor water quality and other \nimpact issues. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n15.  The important environmental impact issues arising from the field investigations and \nstakeholder  consultations  include  the  following:  (i)  negative  impacts  due  to  unproductive \nmanagement of livestock-generated wastes were common on all farms; (ii) no farms had waste \ntreatment facilities; (iii) generated solid wastes are deposited in earthen ditches and, concrete \ncontainers, or heaped in the open, while liquid wastes are drained into closed water bodies, \nreleased into streams, or poured on the  ground; (iv) all surveyed farms are using veterinary \nvaccines and medicines; (v) residues from these farms are likely to produce no noticeable \nimpact on the environment; and (vi) none of the surveyed farmers have any knowledge about \nthe country\u2019s environmental  policies and legislation. \n \n16.  In  the  light  of  the  findings,  several  recommendations  can  be  made.  Farmers  need \ntraining  and  motivation  to  use  farm-generated  wastes  to  produce  biogas.  NGO  staff,  in \ncooperation with local NGOs and the Department of Agriculture, must train farmers on the \nlagoon treatment for generated effluents, and compost preparation using solid and semisolid \nwastes. Farmers require awareness training to comply with the Department of Environment \nrules and regulations on farm activities and waste disposal. Farmers will also benefit from \ntraining on the safe handling and health effects of veterinary vaccines and medicines, and the \nsafe  preparation  of  poultry  and  cattle  feed  and  preservation  techniques.  Training  the \nimplementing agency and NGO staff as trainers to regularly conduct community environmental \nawareness orientation will be useful. \n ", "  Appendix 12  53 \nG.  Conclusions  \n17.  The  IEE  did  not  find  any  irreversible  adverse  environmental  impact  caused  by \nimplementing  the  Project.  No  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  However,  the \nchilling, pasteurizing, and packaging units\u2014for which credit will be provided under the marketing \nand small business development subcomponent\u2014will have to conform to the environmental \nclearance  certificate  issued  to  the  Project.  The  Project  can  be  made  sustainable  by \nimplementing the specified resource management training and monitoring programs. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R275-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031129162519Z", "Title": "Second Participatory Livestock Development Project - Bangladesh", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040305100232+08'00'"}}
