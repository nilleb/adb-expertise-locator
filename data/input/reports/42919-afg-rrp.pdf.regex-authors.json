I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand  political  risk  guarantee  (PRG)  for  the  phase  III  expansion  of  Roshan\u2019s  mobile \ncommunications network (the Project). \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n\"Asia\u2019s infrastructure demand\u2014estimated at more than $300 billion a year\u2014needs to be met to \nensure inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Roads, energy, water, telecommunications\u2014\nthese  are  the  lifelines  connecting  families  and  communities  to  a  brighter  future\"  \u2013  ADB \nPresident, Haruhiko Kuroda1 \n \n2.  Phased Asian Development Bank Assistance\u2014Phases I and II. Roshan is the clear \nleader in Afghanistan\u2019s mobile telecommunications market. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas assisted Roshan\u2019s growth in a phased manner. In November 2004, ADB approved a loan of \n$35 million to finance the phase I expansion of Roshan\u2019s mobile cellular telephony network and \nrestructuring of its capital base very shortly after it started operations.2 To cater for tremendous \nconsumer demand for mobile telecom services, ADB provided a further loan of $50 million (of \nwhich  $15  million  was  funded  by  commercial  banks  under  a  B-loan),  and  a  political  risk \nguarantee of $10 million to finance phase II expansion toward the goal of countrywide coverage \nin June 2007.3 The loans are fully drawn, repayments have started on schedule, and Roshan is \nin compliance (subject to waivers granted by ADB) with all loan covenants, including reporting \nrequirements. Roshan has exceeded its growth targets since its launch on 27 July 2003 and has \nweathered a degree of recent market dislocation caused by vigorous competition (itself a key \nsignal of the success of this sector of the Afghan economy), a situation that is now normalizing.    \n \n3.  Phase  III\u2014Substantial  Unmet  Demand.  Roshan  has  consistently  maintained  its \nposition as the largest mobile telecom company in Afghanistan, with over 40% of the market \nshare (about 12% more than its nearest competitor). The proposed phase III expansion aims at \nensuring that mobile telecom services reach almost all semi-urban and major rural areas\u2014\nachieving significant levels of population coverage, adding and upgrading network capacity, and \nenhancing economies of scale for more affordable mobile telecom services in the face of strong \ncompetition.  Currently,  Roshan\u2019s  network  covers4 17  million  Afghans,  about  54%  of  the \npopulation.5  Financing will also support the deployment of new services such as the innovative \nmobile banking, M-Paisa6, and the use of green technology in the form of solar panels in place \nof diesel generators. \n \n4.  Roshan\u2019s Request for Financing. To finance this phase III expansion, Roshan had \ninitially requested an additional aggregate debt funding of about $105 million from ADB and \nother current and prospective senior lenders, together with additional funding from shareholders. \nThe concept of this Project was cleared on 16 May 2008, and due diligence was carried out in \n                                                 \n1  Opening speech to the ADB 2008 Annual Meeting in Madrid. \n2  ADB. 2004.

Additional meetings were held in Dubai, London, \nand Manila to coordinate the financing.   \n \n5.  Proven Development Impact. Roshan\u2019s phase I expansion in 2004 was the first private \nsector intervention of its kind in recent Afghan history. The nation had not seen any significant \nprivate  sector  investment  in  almost  30  years  because  of  its  difficult  political  and  security \nsituation. Notwithstanding the challenges, over the past 4 years Roshan has become the largest \nsingle taxpayer in Afghanistan, accounting for about 6%\u20137% of domestically generated, non-\ndonor, government revenue. It is considered one of the soundest private sector companies in \nAfghanistan, with the highest standards of corporate governance and the most profound impact \non the lives of Afghans throughout the country and throughout society. As a result of its success, \nthe telecom market in Afghanistan has become one of the most openly competitive sectors of \nthe economy, receiving far more foreign direct investment than any other. The telecoms market \nis  touted  as  one  of  the  great  successes  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  economic  liberalization  and \nrenaissance, and an example for the rest of the economy.  \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE,  \nISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Telecommunications Services Sector in Afghanistan \n6.  Leapfrogging  into  Mobile  Telephony. After more than two and a half decades of \nconflict, Afghanistan had no basic transport and communication infrastructure. However, the \nAfghanistan telecom market has grown at an unprecedented pace since Roshan\u2019s entry. In the \ntelecoms market, 1 Afghan year is considered equivalent to as many as 10 years in other \ncountries, since the rate of adoption has been so explosive and transformational. The less \ncapital-intensive nature of mobile telephony, and the lower rollout complexity, has allowed the \nAfghanistan  telecom  market  to  leapfrog  the  conventional  development  stages  of  fixed  line \ntelephone systems.  \n \n7.  A Vital Element of Life. Mobile telephony is regarded as the only viable means of \nproviding reliable, nationwide communication capacity in Afghanistan. This is evidenced by \nalmost  universal  dependence\u2014including  the  foreign  security  and  donor  communities,  the \nGovernment, and business\u2014on the cellular network for the most basic operations. Recent \nservice  interruptions  caused  by  Taliban  insurgents,  and  the  strong  reaction  to  these \ninterruptions by the affected communities, demonstrate how vital mobile telecommunications \nhave become in the everyday lives of the Afghan people.  \n \n8.  Essential  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  Development. In a war torn country with 45% of the \npopulation under 15 years old, the need to gain knowledge, exchange ideas, and connect with \nothers is vital for the nation\u2019s development. ADB-commissioned studies show that the economic \nbenefits of telecommunications (particularly in rural areas) are broader, and benefit-cost ratios are \nhigher, than indicated by usual project economic analyses.7  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Telecommunications Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1995. Technical \nAssistance to Thailand for a Socioeconomic Impact Study of Rural Telecommunications. Manila (TA 2381-THA). \nThese studies conclude that the economic benefits of telecommunications are at least twice what subscribers pay for \nthe service, and much higher for some user groups. Additional benefits are derived in education, employment, \nagriculture, environment, health, and safety. ", "3 \n      \n9.  Mobile  Telephony  and  its  Development  Impact.  The  widely  cited  example  of \nBangladesh\u2019s GrameenPhone expansion financing8 is worth repeating, as it has a similar profile \nand rationale to the Roshan phase III expansion with its focus on semi-urban and rural areas. \nThe  identified  development  impacts  for  the  GrameenPhone  financing  were:  (i)  continued \nexpansion of the telecommunication sector, which had large unmet demand and un-serviced \ngeographical  regions;  (ii)  the  expanded  role  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME) \nservice providers, which are subcontractors of GrameenPhone; (iii) expansion of village pay \ntelephones  to  un-serviced  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  support  for  GrameenPhone\u2019s  unique \ncontributions to good governance in the Bangladesh telecommunications sector.  \n \nB.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n10.  Low Penetration. Coverage has grown remarkably in the last 4 years, but it is still far \nfrom nationwide. Significant additional investment is required, particularly to reach the more \ndispersed and underserved segments of society. Afghanistan\u2019s penetration rate9 is only a little \nover 12%. Compared to similar size markets (Table 1), Afghanistan has significant growth \npotential (e.g., the penetration rate in Kenya is 32%). Kenya\u2019s relatively high penetration rate, \nnotwithstanding relatively low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, has been boosted by \nan innovative mobile payment system called M-Pesa which was launched in March 2007 by \nSafaricom, Kenya\u2019s largest mobile operator and an affiliate of Vodafone. Vodafone is teaming \nup with Roshan introducing a similar product called M-Paisa in Afghanistan.  \n \nTable 1: Penetration Rate of Similar Markets \n \n< Age 15  GDP Per \nPopulation  Years   Capita  Subscribers  Penetration \nEconomy  (million)  (%)  ($)  (million)  Operators  (%) \nAfghanistan  31.9    48  1,000  4.0  4  12.4 \nYemen  22.4  45  1,010  4.1  3  18.2 \nKenya  37.5  43  1,344  11.5  3  31.9 \nTanzania  40.5  44  837  8.4  6  21.7 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Roshan and Asian Development Bank estimates (2007 data). \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Dynamic Market Environment \n11.  Investment in the Afghan Mobile Telecom Market\u2014Largest Revenue Generator. To \ndate,  around  $1  billion  has  been  invested  in  developing  Afghanistan\u2019s  mobile \ntelecommunications network (Roshan has invested over $320 million since its inception 4 years \nago).  As  described  in  the  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy, 10  private  sector \ndevelopment plays a key role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The rapid development of the \ntelecommunications sector has acted as a prime example of how a relatively effective enabling \nenvironment can spur private sector development in Afghanistan. The sector has generated \nabout  15%\u201320%  of  the  Government\u2019s  domestically  generated  revenues  (not  including  the \n$90 million generated in license fees). \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2003.

Fast Growing Market\u2014Still with Substantial Unmet Demand. The Afghan mobile \ntelecom market saw 55% growth in 2007 alone, reaching 4 million subscribers by the end of the \nyear. However, about 45% of the population is yet to be covered, especially outside the main \npopulation areas. Of the 366 districts in Afghanistan, Roshan currently has the highest levels of \ncoverage, reaching 211. All the urban districts are covered. The 155 remaining districts are \nmainly  rural  and  require  significant  additional  investment,  particularly  to  reach  the  more \ndispersed and underserved segments of Afghan society. Moreover, there is significant potential \nfor growth in the youth and female segments, which are being strongly targeted by Roshan.11  \n(Appendix 2 provides a summary of the telecom market.) \n \n13.  Significant Investment Requirements. The Government forecasts that penetration will \nreach 35% by 2015.12 The current penetration rate of 12.4% was achieved by investment of \naround  $1  billion  in  mobile  networks.  Based  on  these  statistics,  Roshan  estimates  that \ncontinued growth will require incremental investments in Afghanistan of about $200 million per \nyear as all operators continue to grow and expand into more costly rural areas.  \n \n14.  Competitive Landscape. Given the demand for mobile telephones and the success of \nRoshan, the Government tendered two new licenses, and two new private cellular network \noperators  (Areeba/Investcom  and  Etisalat)  have  entered  the  market.  This  has  dramatically \nchanged the competitive landscape to the benefit of consumers. Currently, the market is served \nby four global system for mobile communications (GSM) network operators (Table 2). After \nAfghan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC) (November 2002) and Roshan (January \n2003), Areeba/Investcom (subsequently taken over by the South Africa-based MTN Group) \nobtained the third GSM license in September 2005 and launched operations in July 2006. \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)-based and state-owned Etisalat13 obtained its license in May 2006 \nand launched in August 2007. Prepaid subscriptions, which constitute over 99% of the mobile \nphones in the Afghan market today, ensure low entry barriers although high rollout costs provide \na relatively strong first-mover advantage.  \n \nTable 2: Comparison \n \nItem  Roshan  AWCC  MTN/Areeba  Etisalat \nLicense   January 2003  November 2001  September 2005  May 2006 \nLicense Fee  $5 million  $3.5 million  $40 million  $40 million \nCommercial Launch  July 2003  April 2002  July 2006  August 2007 \nCovered Population  54%  46%  42%  16% \nPenetration  6%  3.2%  3.5%  0.1% \nPresence  33 provinces  33 provinces  25 provinces  11 provinces \nAWCC = Afghan Wireless Communications Company  \nSource: Roshan. MTN quarterly report (August 2007); company websites (2007 data). \n \n15.  Market Share. Due to its better coverage, better quality of calls, price competitiveness, \nand capacity to deliver a wide range of services, Roshan leads the market with over 40% \nmarket share, equaling over 1.8 million subscribers (end of 2007).  Roshan commands a 12% \n                                                 \n11 Roshan plans to introduce two new products, \u201cyouth and students package\u201d and \u201cwomen and family package\u201d. The \nformer provides SMS and internet on a handset with lower rates, and the latter is intended to promote freedom and \nindependence but will be provided under a family bundle preprogrammed to make calls within the family as a start. \n12 Ministry of Communications. 2007. Annual Report. Kabul.  \n13 The Ministry of Communications conducted a competitive bidding process for two national GSM licenses in 2005. \nInvestcom and Watan Telecom, an Afghan telecommunications service provider, were awarded the licenses but \nWatan Telecom was unable to raise the license fee. Etisalat subsequently negotiated the acquisition of the fourth \nnational GSM license in May 2006. There was considerable industry speculation that Etisalat had expressed an \nintention to purchase a stake in Afghan Telecom, the government-owned fixed-line and fixed-wireless operator.  ", "5 \n      \nmarket share lead over its nearest competitor, which is significant considering the following: (i) it \nis easier for newer entrants to set up communication towers as Roshan had paved the way; and \n(ii) Roshan has positioned itself as the quality telecommunications provider, not the cheapest \nproduct provider. Roshan\u2019s focus on the development and reconstruction of Afghanistan makes \nit the best positioned operator to continue to extend coverage beyond the major cities into rural \nareas with less population density and with less profit potential. \n \n16.  Market  Evolution.  Market  growth  in  2007  was  driven  by  high  demand,  increased \ncompetition, and dramatic declines in both tariffs and SIM prices. The two new entrants came \ninto the market with very aggressive strategies for market penetration that brought intense \ncompetition and eroded earnings for all operators. Subsequently, Etisalat announced in May \nthat it will double its price. Such signs of market corrections are encouraging and the operators\u2019 \nability to quickly respond to market dynamics are becoming increasingly important. Because of \nfierce  competition,  and  operators  aiming  to  achieve  economies  of  scale,  the  price  of  the \nsubscriber identity module (SIM) card has fallen since early 2003 from $129 per SIM to as low \nas $2 per SIM in early 2008. Further, the introduction of per second billing by MTN/Areeba and \nsubsequently Roshan, has made users more price-sensitive and less loyal. More than a quarter \nof  users  have  multiple  SIMs,14 making  market  share  less  relevant  in  gauging  profitability \nbetween operators. Moreover, the rate of multiple SIM users in the market has increased \nsignificantly, shifting the battle to wallet share rather than merely market share. Roshan\u2019s share \nof revenue is about 5 percentage points higher than its market share at about 46%, indicating \nan even wider lead over its competitors. Moreover, with the comparative advantage of better \nmarket knowledge, Roshan is focused on maintaining market leadership. Value-added \u201ckiller \napplications\u201d such as M-Paisa, which aims to capture more wallet share, are being launched to \ncontinue to drive market growth and ensure Roshan\u2019s leadership position.  \n \n2.  Regulatory Environment  \n17.  Liberalization and Privatization Efforts by the Government. Since late 2002, the \nMinistry  of  Communications  (MOC)  has  largely  succeeded  in  the  implementation  of  an \naggressive  program  of  sector  liberalization,  reform,  and  legal  and  regulatory  framework \ndevelopment. After AWCC15 and Roshan, two GSM licenses were awarded in a short span of \ntime  (October  2005  and  May  2006).  The  Arreba/Investcom  and  Etisalat  licenses  raised \n$40 million each for the Government.  \n \n18.  Privatization of Afghan Telecom. In a further move of liberalization, MOC recently \ncommenced the process to dispose of an 80% shareholding in Afghan Telecom.16 As the holder \nof a unified license, Afghan Telecom is permitted to offer its customers any range of services \n(voice, data, and 3G).17 Fierce market competition has taken place since the entry of the last \ntwo participants.  \n \n19.   Implementation  of  the  Telecom  Law.  In  December  2005,  the  Telecom  Services \nRegulation Act of Afghanistan (Telecom Law) was enacted. It provided for the formal regulation \n                                                 \n14 Largely because of SIM price drops (75% in 2007), network, and coverage-related issues. Roshan offers three \ntypes of SIMs (business user, average user, and low-income grade user) while others only offer one type of SIM.  \n15  Some 20% is owned by MOC. \n16 Afghan Telecom operates (i) a legacy fixed and digital fixed line network, which is estimated to have no more than \n50,000\u201380,000 phone lines across the country; and (ii) a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, which \nmay be operated on a mobile basis. It will own a fiber optic cable ring that will eventually link the main cities in \nAfghanistan. The completion of the ring, which is being built by Zhong Xing Telecommunication Equipment \nCompany Limited on a turnkey basis, is delayed but is nonetheless expected to be completed in 2010\u20142011.  \n17 Third generation mobile communication, which is capable of providing higher data transfer rates and services such \nas high-resolution video and multimedia services through spectral efficiency. ", "6      \nof  the  sector  and  codified  the  role  and  authority  of  ATRA,  the  quasi-independent  sector \nregulator.18 The Telecom Law, together with the Private Investment Law, 2005, and the Income \nTax Law, 2005, offered a higher level of predictability.  \n \n20.  Telephony Operators Association. In an effort to address sector-wide issues from an \nindustry  standpoint,  Roshan  spearheaded  the  creation  of  the  Telephony  Operators \nAssociation19  among the operators earlier this year. Parliament is currently reviewing the law. \nLicensees have jointly submitted proposed amendments to the law and have held several \nmeetings with the parliamentary subcommittees responsible for telecommunications to lobby for \nthe amendments. Roshan has worked hard to develop a close working relationship with the \nparliamentary  telecommunications  subcommittees.  Strategically,  the  subcommittees  are  an \neffective check on potentially arbitrary decision making and actions within ATRA and MOC\u2014this \nis particularly important given the lack of an effective ability to appeal ATRA decisions, although \nsome developments are made by creating a forum within DAB to address dispute resolutions. \nADB is assisting through dialogue with the Government on many of these sector-wide issues \nand will continue to press for fair and independent regulation and tax treatment. Generally, \nissues are being resolved and progress is being made, but guidance needs to be provided \nconsistently.  \n \nD.  ADB Operations in the Country and Sector \n1.  In Afghanistan  \n \n21.  ADB Support. Since the resumption of its activities in Afghanistan in 2002 through to \nthe end of 2007, ADB had approved nearly $1.3 billion in loans, grants, technical assistance, \nand private sector investments to support Afghanistan\u2019s development; and is administering a \nfurther $133.4 million in funding agency-financed or cost-shared activities, including assistance \nthrough the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. Appendix 3 provides further detail.  \n \n22.  ADB Activities. ADB funds have helped rebuild important road and power infrastructure \nand irrigation systems in northern Afghanistan, and have promoted agricultural growth and \npoverty reduction by contributing to the development of a sound policy framework and efficient \nsector institutions. At the 2006 London Conference on Afghanistan, ADB pledged to consider \nassistance of about $1 billion over 2006\u20132010. ADB\u2019s projects are on track, although contract \nawards and disbursements are lagging because of weak government capacity and poor security. \nAt the 2008 Paris International Conference in Support of Afghanistan, ADB pledged up to $1.3 \nbillion assistance over the 2008\u20132012 ADF X period, subject to overall availability of ADF X \nfunding and country performance. This assistance would include loan and equity investments of \nup to $100 million in partnership with local and foreign investors, and guarantees of about $100 \nmillion to catalyze private investments. \n \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n23.  Sector  Strategy.  While  more  modest  than  that  of  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \ninstitutions, ADB\u2019s role in the information and communication sector is to (i) support the private \nsector,  which  is  expected  to  lead  in  developing  information  technology  (IT)  networks; \n(ii) encourage governments to create a predictable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory policy \nand regulatory environment; and (iii) ensure that IT-related rules and practices are responsive to \n                                                 \n18 Prior to enactment of the law, an ad hoc body\u2014the telecommunications regulatory board\u2014had been established \nby presidential decree to regulate the sector.  \n19 The association is being registered with the Ministry of Justice prior to a formal press announcement.  ", "7 \n      \nthe emerging revolutionary changes in the way people conduct business using IT.20 To date, \nADB  has  made  private  sector  loans  to  telecommunications  companies  in  Afghanistan, \nBangladesh, India and the Philippines. Appendix 4 provides further details.  \n \nE.  Corporate Overview of Roshan \n1.  Corporate History  \n \n24.  Remarkable Track Record. Roshan has had significant commercial success as market \nleader. It easily overtook the first entrant and has climbed to and remained the leader by \ncapitalizing on its comparative advantages of highly qualified staff and in-depth understanding of \nthe market, a reputation for quality of service, greater national coverage, innovative marketing, \nand being a first mover in new business and services. Roshan is expected to continue to be the \nfrontrunner in the Afghan telecom market, with one of the most recognized brand names in the \ncountry. It has outperformed its own expansion plans consistently, reaching subscriber targets \nmuch faster than anticipated.

MTI, indirectly controlled by Cable & \nWireless PLC, holds 36.75%, and TeliaSonera UTA owns the remaining 12.25%, which was \nacquired  in  July  2007  from  MCT  Corporation  (MCT),  a  US-based  provider  of  mobile \ntelecommunications to Central Asia and the Russian Federation. Both these shareholders have \nextensive telecommunications expertise that they are extending to Roshan and this essentially \nrepresents a further strengthening in the sponsor profile since phases I and II. Appendix 5 \ncontains more details on the shareholders. \n \n27.  Core  Management  Team.  The  core  management  team  has  been  in  place  since \ncommencement of operations. ADB has worked closely with Roshan\u2019s management over the \nlast 4 years and regards it as a highly competent and value-adding partner. Roshan focused \nheavily on strengthening the senior management in 2007, adding a new chief technology officer \nand chief customer officer in Q4 of 2007 and a new chief marketing officer in early 2008, all of \nwhom have extensive experience in growing GSM operations from the 1 million subscriber to \n5 million subscriber level, which is the growth Roshan is preparing for. Appendix 6 gives brief \nbiographies of Roshan\u2019s management team.  \n \n3.  Strategy Implementation  \n \n28.  Principles for Comparative Advantage. Roshan\u2019s strategy implementation builds on a \nnumber of principles through which Roshan derives significant competitive advantage. The key \nthrusts  are  (i)  rapid  network  rollout  and  extensive  coverage,  (ii)  premium  quality  provider, \n(iii) innovative marketing approach, (iv) strong shareholder support, and (v) social development. \nAppendix 6 also describes Roshan\u2019s strategies.    \n \n4.  Comparative Advantage \n \n29.  Competitor Profiles. Afghanistan has four mobile telecom service providers: Roshan, \nAWCC, MTN (previously Areeba), and Etisalat are the GSM operators. Separately, Afghan \nTelecom is a fixed line and code division multiple access (CDMA) player. Three local fixed \nservice provider licenses have been issued for regional players in rural areas. Only one of \nthese\u2014Wasel  Telecom\u2014which  operates  in  rural  Balkh,  a  northern  province  bordering \nUzbekistan, is currently active and has had limited success to date.  \n \n30.  Competition.  The  Afghan  market  has  become  extremely  competitive  in  the  last         \n18\u201324 months with the entrance of the third and fourth GSM operators. Virtually no other market \nin the world today has had four operators when market penetration was only around 10%. As a \nresult of the increased competition, which has caused significant multiple-SIM usage (now at \nabout 30%), Roshan has shifted its strategy to focus on revenue share and share of wallet in \naddition to simply measuring market share.   \n \n31.  Roshan\u2019s  Comparative  Advantage.  Roshan\u2019s  strengths  will  enable  it  to  counter \ncompetitive threats. It has the following competitive advantages: \n \n(i)  high-quality network installed, \n(ii)  widest coverage, \n(iii)  strong market position, \n(iv)  established distribution network, \n(v)  regional presence,  \n(vi)  seasoned management and staff with Afghan operations experience, and ", "9 \n      \n(vii)  an established name with by far the strongest brand awareness in Afghanistan.  \n \n \n32.  Quality and Coverage. Roshan is focused on its reputation for having a high level of \nservice, and will continue to focus on overall network quality and geographic coverage and \nimprove its international call quality via direct interconnections and international fiber-optic links. \nRoshan\u2019s technology upgrades will enable it to continue to provide premium quality service to its \nsubscribers. Roshan\u2019s social program is also seen as a key brand image differentiator.  \n \n5.  Social Impact and Program  \n \n33.  Largest Social Impact. Since its commercial launch in July 2003, Roshan has built a \nnational  mobile  telephony  network  used  by  about  1.9  million  Afghan  subscribers  across \n211 districts  in  33  provinces  throughout  Afghanistan.  It  indirectly  employs  close  to \n25,000 Afghans  through  its  network  of  contractors,  distributors,  and  resellers  and  support \nbusinesses. It is also the largest private employer, with some 940 staff members, and its total \ninvestments in Afghanistan exceed $330 million. As part of its core commercial operations, \nRoshan  provides  English-language,  IT,  and  GSM  technology  courses,  as  well  as  general \nleadership and management courses to its staff and dealers.  \n \n34.  Largest Single Taxpayer. Roshan has paid some $107 million in taxes and government \nfees  since  its  start  in  2003,  and  is  projecting  payment  of  some  $45  million  in  2008.  It \ncontributions make up some 6% of Afghanistan\u2019s total government budget, making it by far the \ncountry\u2019s largest taxpayer.22 \n \n35.  Largest Community Impact. In addition to its core commercial operations, which bring \ninherent social benefits, Roshan has a strong market reputation and brand recognition thanks to \nits social development efforts. Roshan (based on its AKFED roots) has contributed significantly \nto the development of Afghanistan through a wide array of social programs. Roshan devotes \nsome 1% of its revenue to funding such activities. In 2006, Roshan\u2019s board approved the formal \ncreation  of  the  social  programs  function.  Social  activities  are  focused  in  the  areas  of \nempowerment  (a  telemedicine  program  that  provides  medical  services  utilizing  telephony; \nestablishment of women\u2019s public call offices (PCOs); school construction; and distribution of \neducational toys and the $100 laptop computer\u2014Roshan is the official distributor of the \u201cone \nlaptop per child\u201d initiative for Afghanistan) and philanthropy (soup kitchens providing 33,000 \nmeals per month; water wells catering up to 3,000 families; educational sponsorship supporting \n146 children;  and  welfare  funds  supporting  20  heart  surgeries  are  examples).  Moreover, \nRoshan involves its partners in its Social development activities, increasing the scope and reach \nof its projects.  Further description of Roshan\u2019s social programs is in Appendix 7. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n36.  Key Features. The main purpose of the phase III financing is to expand Roshan\u2019s \nnetwork, both through new coveragIV.e in semi-urban and economically underserved rural areas, \nproviding high-quality network coverage and telecommunications capacity to these areas, and \nby extending the network and adding density23 to existing areas. The expanded network will \n                                                 \n22 A percentage of Roshan\u2019s revenues is reinvested by AKFED into social and economic development projects \nimplemented by AKDN in Afghanistan. \n23 Density refers to connectivity within a specific region.  ", "10     \nenable Roshan to continue with the rollout of PCOs as well as to extend its new mobile money \ntransfer product, M-Paisa, nationwide. Moreover, technology upgrades and replacements that \nallow for a higher quality, more cost-efficient network will enable Roshan to drive down prices \nand provide additional functionality to Afghan subscribers.  \n \n77.  Semi-Urban and Rural Expansion. Market penetration is projected to reach 20% by \nthe end of 2008. However, current penetration is concentrated mainly in urban areas, and \npenetration in semi-urban and rural areas remains quite low. The phase III expansion Project \naims to expand the network, deploying a synchronous digital hierarchy fiber-optic microwave \nring,  implementing  alternative  power  solutions  such  as  solar  power,  increasing  capacity  in \nexisting cities, and enhancing network redundancy.  \n \n37.  Backbone.  Roshan  started  to  build  out  a  synchronous  digital  hierarchy  fiber-optic \nmicrowave backbone in 2005 to reduce the dependency on very small aperture satellite terminal \n(VSAT). The move from VSAT enables increased capacity to handle the high subscriber volume \nprojected for the plan, reduces operating expenses by reducing dependency on expensive \nVSAT technology, and simplifies network maintenance\u2014enabling Roshan to drive down prices \nfor  Afghan  subscribers,  while  allowing  significant  improvements  in  quality  and  decreased \nlatency.24   \n \n38.  Regional Integration. Currently, Roshan is connected with Pakistan, Tajikistan, and \nUAE  via  microwave  links  for  interconnecting  traffic  between  Roshan  subscribers  and \ninternational operators.  \n \n39.  M-Paisa\u2014Key  Features.  Another  key  feature  of  Roshan\u2019s  reengineering  is  its  full \nlaunch of M-Paisa. This is a powerful product in a country where more people own mobile \nphones than have bank accounts\u2014about 97% of the Afghan population does not have access \nto traditional banking infrastructure. M-Paisa will permit individuals to send money to another \nmobile user (including non-Roshan customers), receive money from another Roshan mobile \ncustomer, receive and repay loans from microfinance institutions, purchase Roshan airtime, \nreceive and disburse salaries, and pay for goods and services. Currently, there are no other \ncompetitive mobile money transfer products in the Afghan market. The M-Paisa product will \nbring  the  following  benefits  to  Roshan:  (i)  increase  customer  loyalty  through  a  new  and \ninnovative product; (ii) contribute to the prime SIM effect in a multiple-SIM environment\u2014a \nproduct such as M-Paisa can incentivize users to keep their Roshan SIM in their phones; \n(iii) increase SMS usage; and (iv) decrease churn25\u2014experience from M-Pesa in Kenya (para. \n10) shows that it was a strong contributor to churn reduction.  \n \n \nB.  Outcome  \n40.  Expected Results. Expanded network coverage is the main expected outcome. The \nfollowing key targets are anticipated by 2010:  \n \n(i)  Network subscriber base.  \n(ii)  Full Coverage in Provincial capitalsNumber of districts.  \n(iii)  Base transceiver station Growth \n(iv)  Public call offices. Increase in telecommunications access for those who cannot \nafford mobiles by increasing the number of PCOs.  \n(v)  Cross-border interconnections.  \n                                                 \n24 Latency refers to delay or lag time in sending data and/or voice from one mobile phone to another. \n25 Churn occurs when subscribers are deactivated from the telecommunication network equipment.

The  Project  aims  to  promote  inclusive  and  pro-poor \neconomic growth and development through improved and widespread telephone connectivity, \nespecially in semi-urban and rural areas. The Project will cover over 25 million people with \n5.5 million subscribers, 40% of which will be in semi-urban and rural areas. It will contribute in \nachieving the national objective of an overall penetration level of 35% by 2015 from the current \nlevel of 12.4%. \n \n42.  Impact,  Outcome,  and  Output.  The  development  impact  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \ntelecommunications industry is widely recognized. Roshan is considered one of the soundest \nprivate sector companies in Afghanistan, contributing substantially to the Government\u2019s tax \nrevenue income. Roshan\u2019s phase III expansion will further the development impacts witnessed \nin the earlier phases, with expanded economic growth in semi-urban and rural areas. The \nProject will cover 60 new districts, double the number of BTSs to 1,490 with 50% of these in \nnew districts, and increase telecommunications access for those who cannot afford mobiles by \ntripling the number of PCOs to 6,850. Mobile telecommunications will improve the delivery of \nservices such as health care, education, and security throughout the country. As was the case \nfor past expansions, the third phase will provide direct training, jobs, and business opportunities \nin underdeveloped areas to staff, dealers, and subcontractors. Further, the M-Paisa initiative will \nadd a new facet to the development impact by providing mobile money transfers and means for \nextending microcredit in a country where 97% of the population does not have access to \nbanking. The M-Paisa service is expected to target 750,000 Afghans. Regional integration will \nimprove through new interconnectivity initiatives with the neighboring countries. The success of \nthis Project is important in further encouraging a nascent private sector and hesitant foreign \ndirect investment to Afghanistan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD.  Development Effectiveness \n43.  Private Sector Development. The development effectiveness of the Project will be \nassessed  in  terms  of  private  sector  development,  business  success,  and  economic \nsustainability in accordance with the guidelines for implementing the good practice standards for \nevaluation of private sector investment operations prepared by the evaluation cooperation group \nof  multilateral  development  banks.26 Implementation  of  the  Project  will  increase  Roshan\u2019s \ncapacity to implement and operate large-scale projects and to be a market leader in providing \ngood quality, competitively priced telecommunication services. In the telecommunications sector, \nit  will  set  high  benchmarks  and  standards,  promote  competition,  and  contribute  to  further \ndeveloping the regulatory capacity. At a broader level, success of the Project will have a strong \ndemonstration  effect  and  establish  the  viable  operation  of  private  sector  operations  in \nAfghanistan. This, in turn, will increase foreign direct investment in other sectors in the economy. \nThe Project is financially and economically sustainable and will have environmental benefits by \nreducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting the application of renewable energy options. \nThe Project\u2019s development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n26 Multilateral Development Banks, Evaluation Cooperation Group, Working Group on Private Sector Evaluation \n(WGPSE). 2006.

The principal agreement underpinning Roshan\u2019s operations is the \noperating  license,  purchased  in  January  2003  for  $5  million.  The  license  gives  Roshan \nnonexclusive right to provide GSM mobile telephone services throughout Afghanistan as well as \nan international gateway. The main terms of the license agreement are (i) validity through \nJanuary 2018, renewable for an additional 10 years; (ii) specific radio frequency assignment \ngranted; (iii) approval granted to import equipment; (iv) ability to set and adjust tariffs with prior \npublic notice (with the exception of those deemed to have significant market power, which would \nhave to get tariffs approved by the regulator); and (v) provision for interconnection with other \noperators covering both domestic and international traffic.  \n \n45.  Other Arrangements. Roshan has signed agreements with Afghan Telecom, AWCC, \nMTN/Areeba, and Etisalat that are based on international market practices for interconnection. \nThe M-Paisa product will be operated out of Roshan\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, which will enter \ninto a managed service management agreement with Vodafone. Each party will allocate internal \noperating costs to the M-Paisa subsidiary and share equally in the net profit generated.  \n  \nF.  Project Financing Plan \n46.  Debt Financing Plan. Roshan aims to raise the $85 million in new debt, reduced from \nthe initially contemplated $105 million as a result of the increase in non-external financings of \n$90 million from $70 million. An appropriate gearing ratio will be maintained for the company. \nWhile still under discussion, financing participants are expected to be similar to the phase II \nfinancing  (subject  to  market  appetite  and  recognizing  the  very  limited  market  interest  in \ncorporate financing in Afghanistan). The French development company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Promotion et \nde Participation pour la Coop\u00e9ration Economique (PROPARCO) is expected to participate. The \nGerman Investment and Development Company (DEG) is likely to participate.  \n \nG.  Economic Analysis \n47.  The  positive  correlation  between  teledensity27 and  economic  growth  has  been  well \ndocumented for a considerable period through a number of empirical studies. In a typical \ndeveloping country, an increase in mobile penetration of 10% boosts GDP growth by around 1 \npercentage point.28 In Afghanistan, this impact on growth would be larger given the absence of \nother means of communications and the nonexistent teledensity outside larger urban areas. \nSignificant opportunities exist for accelerating economic growth through additional investments \nin the telecommunication sector. \n \n48.  The Project involves setting up BTSs and PCOs in semi-urban and rural areas, with a \nview to increasing coverage of mobile services in areas that are currently experiencing low or no \nconnectivity. The Project will further facilitate extension of microcredit services to people through \nthe cellular network in these remote areas, including non-Roshan subscribers. This will result in \nimproved information flow, broadened markets for goods and services, enhanced economic \nactivities of SMEs, substitute for physical travel and transport, and reduced transaction costs.  \n \n49.  The Project also reduces the costs of mobile services, improves the quality of services, \nand increases regional connectivity. Lower costs and better quality will translate to lower tariffs, \nan increase in affordability, and more usage of mobile services. This and the related microcredit \n                                                 \n27 Teledensity is defined as the number of telephones per 100 people.  \n28 The Economist. 2008. Mobile Telecoms Halfway There. 31 May.  ", "13 \n      \nservices to be provided by the Project will have a multiplier effect on the economic benefits from \nthe Project. In the project design, the energy requirements of 15% of its operations will be based \non  solar  energy\u2014thereby  reducing  consumption  of  diesel  and  the  resultant  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gases. The scale of operations will generate employment for 6,500 people directly \nand indirectly. The Project will therefore yield multiple economic and environmental benefits to \nthe  country,  although  such  benefits  may  not  be  precisely  measurable  through  quantitative \neconomic analysis.  \n \nH.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  Roshan\u2019s annual accounts are audited by KPMG Afghanistan. As a private company, \nRoshan is not obliged to disclose its financial statements to the public. Roshan follows standard \nADB reporting requirements for its existing loan, and will continue to do so for this loan. \n \nI.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  As required under the existing loan, Roshan will continue to provide quarterly expansion \nreports, detailing the growth in subscribers, BTSs, and network coverage rollout.29 ADB will \nmonitor the expansion vis-\u00e0-vis the business plan. Evaluation of the Project will be based on \nthree levels: (i) the success of the Project itself, (ii) development of the telecommunications \nsector in general, and (iii) private sector development. Appendix 1 contains the development \nimpact and performance monitoring framework, including relevant performance indicators. \n \nJ.  Project Review \n52.  The  Project  will  be  reviewed  regularly  in  accordance  with  standard  ADB  portfolio \nmanagement and project evaluation practice, in conjunction with two previous phase financings.  \n \nK.  Environmental and Other Safeguard Policy Aspects  \n53.  The environment category for Roshan phase III expansion project is C, following the two \nearlier project phases that were assigned the same classification. The expansion program will \ninvolve construction of over 700 additional BTSs, built both on buildings and ground-based sites \nwith an area of about 144 square meters. About 5,000 PCOs will be established in existing \nshops and facilities. Because of the limited construction activities associated with the Project, \nthere will be no negative environmental impact.  \n \n54.  The  two  previous  phases  did  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous \npeople impacts. The phase III expansion project is category C, as there are no requirements for \ninvoluntary resettlement and no specific impacts on indigenous peoples. All sites will be leased, \nas Roshan does not purchase land. Roshan\u2019s site selection criteria are defined well\u2014BTSs are \non leased unused lands in urban areas and sparsely populated unproductive desert lands in \nrural areas. No sites will be selected that (i) are adjacent to or within any environmentally \nsensitive areas and sites of cultural and historical importance, (ii) require relocation of housing, \nand (iii) displace non-titled informal settlers or economic users of the land. Generally, Roshan \nprefers to lease vacant government-owned land. If private property is leased, the site selection \nwill depend on the property owners\u2019 willingness to lease the land and accept a negotiated rental \nprice at prevailing market rates.  \n \n                                                 \n29 Linklaters. 2005.

The environmental and social due diligence assessments has confirmed that procedures \non  site  selection,  BTS  construction,  and  waste  management  have  been  satisfactorily \nimplemented  by  Roshan  in  the  earlier  project  phases.  The  company  has  also  designated \nspecific  offices  departments  (e.g.,  facilities,  deployment,  security  and  human  resource \ndepartments) responsible for the workplace and employees\u2019 health and safety. Roshan has a \ncorporate social responsibility program, with about 1% of its revenue allocated to funding social \nactivities focused on three key areas\u2014philanthropy, social business development opportunities, \nand empowerment initiatives. Its social program interventions include provision of opportunities \nfor development of SMEs, educational sponsorships, welfare funds, telemedicine programs, \nwater  wells,  soup  kitchens,  women\u2019s  PCOs,  e-learning  centers,  schools  and  children\u2019s \nplaygrounds, among others.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n56.  Development Impact\u2014Track Record. ADB was first approached by AKFED, Roshan\u2019s \nmajority shareholder, and Roshan in early 2004 for financing of Roshan\u2019s phase I network \nexpansion.  The  project  proved  successful  and  was  followed  with  the  phase  II  expansion, \napproved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in June 2007. The justifications for assisting the phase III \nProject continue to be manifold. The developmental impact of mobile telephony, the technical \nand financial sustainability of the business model, the economic and social benefits of the \nProject including environmental sustainability, with the unmet need for medium-term finance \nfrom the commercial market, its role in advancing regulatory reform, and its full compatibility \nwith ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update ,30 are all compelling.  \n \n57.  Rationale  for  Supporting  the  Phase  III\u2014Rural  Development.  Roshan  requires \n$85 million in debt, reduced from its original $105 million, for its business plan to be fully funded. \nIn  the  dynamic  Afghan  telecom  market,  and  with  the  importance  of  quickly  spurring \nreconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, the proposed additional financing has very significant \ndevelopment impacts. It will help address unmet demand, especially in semi-urban and rural \nareas where reconstruction efforts have been most limited. Without the phase III funding, not \nonly Roshan\u2019s pace of expansion but also the country\u2019s pace of reconstruction will be impacted. \nThere are no commercial sources of financing that can substitute ADB funding. \n \nB.  Nature and Amount \n58.  ADB\u2019s proposed financial assistance is expected to be a term loan of up to $60 million \nwithout government guarantee.  \n \nC.  Main Terms and Conditions \n59.  The loan terms will be largely similar to the phase II financing, with subordination of \nrelated party transactions as needed. The phase III financing will take into account (to the extent \nreasonable and not compromising the position of the senior lenders) Roshan\u2019s debt service \ntrack record to date, its evolution as a leading corporation in Afghanistan, and dynamic market \nconditions  of  the  still  nascent  telecom  market.  After  the  expansion  financing,  Roshan  will \ncontinue to have a conservative gearing ratio. ADB\u2019s fees and premium for this political risk \ncover will be market-driven and as determined by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement \nCommittee. \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Afghanistan. Manila. ", "15 \n      \n \nD.  Value-Added by ADB \n60.  ADB will add value through the following measures: \n \n(i)  Catalyzing investment. Without secure, medium-term financing, mobile network \nexpansion in Afghanistan will be constrained. This will hinder the development of \na  thriving  sector  that  is  the  main  driver  of  private  sector  development  in \nAfghanistan. There is no functioning local debt market, and offshore commercial \nand export credit debt sources are largely not interested in extending uncovered \nfinancing to businesses in Afghanistan. However, ADB\u2019s involvement can act as \na catalyst, as it did in the previous expansion financings, to encourage other \nlenders to participate in the phase III financing. \n \n(ii)  Promote  private  sector  development.  The  demonstration  effect  of  the \ncontinued support to a well-capitalized private sector-led, Afghan reconstruction \neffort success story (of which there are not many) will encourage entrepreneurs \nand financial investors to consider investments in key sectors in Afghanistan. It \nalso assists the Government in identifying the regulatory and legislative areas \nthat need improvement in promoting much-needed private sector development. \nThe  benefits  of  well-regulated  market  competition  also  provide  important \nexamples for other areas of the economy.  \n \n \n(iii)  Dialogue  with  the  Government.  ADB  adds  value  in  engaging  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  stakeholders,  and  raising  issues  perceived  as \nimpediments to growth of the sector and the economy.  \n \n(iv)  Cooperation. Strengthening the cooperation with Roshan and its shareholders\u2014\nAKFED  (noting  the  recently  signed  memorandum  of  understanding  with \nAKDN/AKFED),  MCT,  and  TeliaSonera\u2014enables  further  cooperation  in  the \ntelecom sphere in other parts of Central Asia where these partners are also \nactive. \n \nE.  Link to Country Strategy and Program \n61.  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 and \nthe  Government\u2019s  strategic  intentions.  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  reconstruction  of  Afghanistan  is \n(i) building  capacity,  (ii)  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  and \n(iii) rehabilitating  essential  infrastructure.  The  Project,  which  aims  to  expand  the  mobile \ncommunications network nationwide, is anchored in the third point. The telecommunication \nsector has led private sector development of Afghanistan and is helping build capacity and \nestablish policy and institutional frameworks to promote further economic growth.  \n \n62.  The phase III Project\u2019s focus on expanding into semi-urban and rural areas further \nsupports inclusive economic growth, \u201creducing rising inequalities in incomes in different regions \nas  well  as  gaps  between  urban  and  rural  areas\u201d.  Regional  integration  via  interconnection \nagreements with operators in neighboring countries is also in line with the thrust of the country \nstrategy and program update. Further, the update states explicitly that no change is anticipated \nin ADB\u2019s engagement in the telecommunications sector (via the existing loan to Roshan, and \nalso  through  ADB\u2019s  membership  in  the  consultative  group  for  energy,  mining,  and \ntelecommunications) as \u201cADB\u2019s\u2026private sector support to the\u2026telecommunications sectors\u2026\u201d \nis \u201chighly appreciated\u201d by the Government.  \n ", "16     \n63.  No Negative Impact. Roshan\u2019s construction works have virtually no negative impact on \nthe environment. The environmental category of the phase I and II projects was C, and will \nremain C for phase III. There will be minimal cable construction and masts will be located on \nexisting buildings or in open fields. Neither the original construction nor the expansion will result \nin any resettlement, and the Project will be classified resettlement category C. The Project is not \nforeseen to have any negative impact on indigenous peoples, and is consequently classified \ncategory C. All categorizations remain unchanged from phases I and II. \n \nF.  Investment Limits \n64.  The  proposed  investment,  ADB\u2019s  seventh  nonsovereign  investment  in  Afghanistan, \nwould,  if  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  1.1%  of  ADB\u2019s  total  expected  nonsovereign \nexposure,31 and increase ADB\u2019s nonsovereign exposure (i) in Afghanistan from 1.6% to 2.7% \ntotal exposure, and (ii) in the telecommunications and communications sector from 4.3% to \n5.4% total exposure. ADB\u2019s exposure to Roshan would increase from $63.8 million to (up to) \n$123.8 million. Outstanding loans of $63.8 million represents 24.6% of Roshan\u2019s total assets as \nat 2007. Based on Roshan\u2019s financing plan, ADB\u2019s exposure may exceed 25% of total assets \nboth before and at the time the ADB loan has been fully disbursed should operational cashflows \nbe  lower  than  anticipated,  or  loans  from  other  lenders are  disbursed  later  than  expected. \nManagement will therefore seek a waiver from the Board with respect to the single exposure \nlimit under ADB\u2019s policy on prudential limits,32 ADB\u2019s Risk Management Unit (RMU) has noted \nthat no new shareholder equity has been committed by Roshan\u2019s owners, and accordingly, that \nADB\u2019s exposure may exceed 25% of total capitalization if losses continue. RMU supports the \nrequest for a waiver based on Roshan\u2019s strong franchise and market position, a well-established \nrelation with the majority owner and a reasonable business plan. The proposed investment is \nwithin  approved  aggregate,  country,  and  industry  exposure  limits  for  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign \noperations. \n \nG.  Anticorruption Policy  \n65.  Roshan has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB\u2019s  current \ninvestment documentation with Roshan requires Roshan to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation \nbetween  ADB  and  Roshan  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential \nviolation of these undertakings. M-Paisa is regulated under DAB as a money service provider \nand its anti-money-laundering procedures have been approved by DAB. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n66.  No-Objection Letter. Consistent with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Charter, ADB will obtain a \nno-objection letter from the Government with respect to the proposed loan before any funding \nunder the loan is disbursed. \n \n                                                 \n31 Expected  nonsovereign  exposure  is  defined  as  Board-approved  and  effective  transactions  (outstanding  + \nundisbursed commitments) plus Board-approved but not yet effective transactions. An amount is considered \ncommitted when there are signed legal agreements. Total exposures are as of 2 June 2008. \n32 ADB. 2007. Doc. R54-2007.

Introduction \n1.  In  November  2002,  1  year  following  the  fall  of  the  Taliban,  mobile  penetration  in \nAfghanistan was estimated at roughly 0.01%, one of the lowest in the world. The Ministry of \nCommunications (MOC) reported only 33,000 lines in service in the country\u2019s major cities, while \nlines in provincial and rural areas had not been considered as so few were working. As a result \nof a complete lack of investment in fixed-line telephony since the Soviet occupation in 1979, \nAfghanistan\u2019s existing infrastructure was either neglected through lack of funding or damaged in \nthe armed conflict that spanned nearly 26 years. The capital, Kabul, was estimated to have just \n20,150 fixed lines in the late 1990s, serving over 2 million people, with most calls dialed being \neither dropped or never connected. \n \n2.  In  an  investment  climate  survey  in  2005,34most  of  the  surveyed  firms  mentioned \ntelecommunications as a major or severe problem. Afghanistan\u2019s mobile penetration35 in 2007 is \ncurrently estimated to be about 12%.   \n \nB.  Sector Policy and Regulatory Environment \n3.  The  Law  for  Regulation  of  Telecommunication  Services  (the  Telecom  Law)  was \npromulgated in December 2005 and a regulatory board, the Afghanistan Telecommunications \nRegulatory Authority (ATRA), was set up.   \n \n4.  There remains an access agenda for rural areas, a need to improve the quality and \nrange of services considerably, and to reduce prices further. Nonetheless, progress to date has \nbeen remarkable. The Telecom Development Fund was meant to play a role in this area, but \nlimited progress has been seen to date. \n \n5.  Over the past 7 years, as the telecommunications sector has continued to develop, \ntelecommunications revenues have grown to become a significant portion of the Government\u2019s \nbudget.36  \n \n6.  Today, the main objective of government policy for communications is to modernize and \nrapidly expand telecommunications networks and services, and to achieve universal access to \ntelephony  across  the  country.  The  Government  is  also  focusing  on  information  and \ncommunication technologies, seeking to create opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and \ninvesting in developing such opportunities. The Government recognizes the significance of \ncreating the right conditions for open competition and private sector investment by ensuring a \nstable and transparent policy, legal, and regulatory environment.  \n \n                                                 \n33 This  section  is  largely  based  on  World  Bank.  2005.

The Investment Climate in Afghanistan\u2014Exploiting Opportunities in an Uncertain Environment. \nWashington, DC (December). \n35 Telephones per 1,000 people. \n36  Roshan has been responsible for about 65% of the Government\u2019s entire telecoms revenues since its first year of \noperation, and is the single largest contributor to the state budget through a variety of taxes, having contributed \n10% of the state budget in 2005. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n7.  MOC\u2019s vision for the future focuses on the following scope of achievements: \n \n(i)  wide coverage of services in all cities, towns, and 5,000 villages; \n(ii)  improved quality, lower tariffs;  \n(iii)  competitive environment with four global system for mobile communications  \n                  (GSM) operators;  \n(iv)  penetrating 35% of the population in the next 5\u20137 years; \n(v)  50,000 jobs created in the next few years; \n(vi)  cumulative investments in telecom over 1.5 billion in next 4 years; and \n(vii)  more importantly, government revenues from telecom in next 10 years should be \n$2 billion. \n \nC.  Fixed-Line Telephony Market \n8.  In  the  absence  of  any  national  telecommunications  operators,  MOC  took  over  the \noperation of the country\u2019s limited fixed-line infrastructure in 2001. It inherited two separate fixed-\nline networks, an outdated analog system dating back to Soviet rule, and a newer fiber-optic \nnetwork used by the Taliban. Neither network extended beyond the country\u2019s borders nor did \nthey offer reliable interconnectivity. Hence, Afghanistan relied heavily on satellite connectivity for \ninternational calls and limited data transmission, as well as for most domestic long-distance \nservices.  \n \n9.  Although no second fixed-line operator is licensed in Afghanistan, the regulator has set \naside within its numbering plan the possibility of two further licensees. There are currently no \nplans to award additional fixed-line licenses in Afghanistan. \n \nD.  Mobile Telephony Market \n10.  Driven by a competitive market and several hundred million dollars in private investment, \nthe mobile footprint covers about half of the population. Table A2 describes the Afghan mobile \nmarket, based on estimates. \nTable A2: Afghan Mobile Market  \n(\u2018000) \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nAfghan population \n(million)  23  24  25  25  32 \nMobile penetration (%)  0.7 3.0  4.6  6.8  12.4 \nRoshan subscribers  49  390  716  1,069  1,800 \nSources: TeleGeography,Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n11.  Following  the  first commercial  launch  in  Kabul  in  April  2002,  mobile  services  have \ndeveloped rapidly, reaching about 4 million subscribers by December 2007.  \n \n12.  Given the low penetration rate of 12% at the end of 2007, and the fact that 50% of the \npopulation are 15 years of age or younger, the prospects for market growth are significant. The \nyouth  and  female  segments  are  significantly  underpenetrated,  with  considerable  room  for \ncontinued growth. \n ", "Appendix 2  35 \n13.  Confidence in the sector has resulted in significant private sector investments, most \nrecently evidenced in 2006 by the $40.1 million paid by Investcom and Etisalat for Afghanistan\u2019s \nthird and fourth mobile licenses.   \n \nE.  Market Structure \n14.  The  cellular  market  is  currently  served  by  four  private  cellular  network  operators\u2014\nRoshan, Afghan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC), MTN/Areeba, and Etisalat\u2014and \nthe state-run fixed-line operator Afghan Telecom.  \n \n15.  All GSM-providing companies offer national and international mobile calling, voice mail, \nnational and international SMS, and data services, on prepaid pricing plans. They also offer a \npostpaid pricing plan to corporations. The unreliability of the postal service and lack of retail \nbanking infrastructure remain a barrier to further development of this product.  \n \nF.  Internet Communication \n16.  The internet has become one of the most efficient ways for firms to communicate and \nconduct business with distant clients. However, in Afghanistan, business use of the internet is \nnearly nonexistent outside of a few of the largest cities. On average, 15% of the surveyed firms \nregularly use e-mail in interactions with their clients and suppliers, and 9% use web pages. \nThere is a distinct regional difference in the use of the internet. Almost a quarter of enterprises \nin Kabul, Herat, and Mazar-e-Sharif reported using the internet.

", "Appendix 5  43 \nB.  Descriptions of the Shareholders \n1.  Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development  \n3.  The Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) is the economic development \narm of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), a group of development agencies seeking \nto  improve  opportunities  and  living  conditions  in  specific  regions  of  the  developing  world, \nespecially Africa and Asia. AKDN, which has been supporting humanitarian assistance and \nrehabilitation in Afghanistan since 1996, works for the common good of all citizens, regardless \nof their gender, origin, or religion. Its underlying impulse is the ethic of compassion for the \nvulnerable in society. Its programs in Afghanistan come under a comprehensive development \nagreement signed by the Aga Khan and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.  \n \n4.  For more than 50 years, AKFED has made investments and operated companies in the \ndeveloping nations of Africa, South Asia, and Central Asia. AKFED seeks to create profitable, \nsustainable enterprises through long-term investments that result in strong equity positions. This \nin turn allows AKFED to take a \u201chands-on\u201d approach by providing managerial and technical \nexpertise.  Profits  generated  by  the  fund  are  reinvested  in  other  economic  development \ninitiatives under the AKFED umbrella. \n \n5.  AKFED often works in collaboration with local and international development partners to \ncreate  and  operate  companies  that  provide  goods  and  services  essential  to  economic \ndevelopment.  These  range  from  banking  to  electric  power,  agricultural  processing,  hotels, \nairlines, and telecommunications. AKFED also works with governments to help promote the \ncreation of enabling legal and fiscal structures that encourage the growth of the private sector.  \n \n6.  At the invitation of several governments, AKFED has helped critical sectors make the \ntransition to market economies through privatization. These include banking, power generation, \ntourism,  manufacturing,  and  agriculture  in  countries  as  varied  as  Afghanistan,  Pakistan, \nTajikistan,  and  Uganda.  AKFED\u2019s  approach  emphasizes  the  development  of  local  human \nresources  over  time,  including  managerial,  technical,  marketing,  and  financial  skills.  Other \ncharacteristics of this approach include providing essential seed capital to launch projects in \nthose sectors and countries where attracting investment is difficult. AKFED takes a long-term \nview  to  build  viable,  self-sustaining,  and  profitable  companies.  It  also  participates  in  the \nmanagement of companies in which it invests, with the aim of preparing companies for broader \nownership by local interests. \n \na.  Financial Services  \n7.  To encourage the creation of strong and efficient capital markets, AKFED provides an \ninstitutional  umbrella  for  banks,  insurance  groups,  and  property-owning  and  management \ncompanies in eastern Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.  \n \n8.  AKFED\u2019s investments include a controlling interest in Habib Bank Limited, Pakistan\u2019s \nlargest private bank (acquired through a government privatization program in 2004) and the \nDevelopment Credit Bank Limited in India. AKFED is also the founder and lead shareholder in \nthe Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank  which focuses on the corporate sector and on medium- \nand long-term finance that will contribute to the growth of the banking industry and stimulate \nentrepreneurial activity. In Bangladesh, AKFED is the majority owner of a leading provider of \ncorporate finance and lending services to major businesses and projects.  \n \n ", "44  Appendix 5 \n9.  Its holdings in East Africa include the Diamond Trust Bank, which was founded in the \n1930s in Kenya to help recycle local savings into loans for home building and small businesses. \nIt  now  offers  a  range  of  retail  banking  products.  The  Jubilee  Insurance  Group  provides \ninsurance across the region. In Pakistan, New Jubilee Insurance and New Jubilee Life offer a \nrange of products.  \n \nb.  Tourism Development  \n10.  AKFED\u2019s Tourism Promotion Services seeks to develop tourism potential in selected \nareas in the developing world, particularly in underserved regions. It builds, rehabilitates, and \nmanages hotels and lodges that contribute to economic growth and the overall investment \nclimate in an environmentally and culturally sensitive manner.  \n \n11.  AKFED owns and manages properties in Afghanistan, Kenya, Mozambique, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, operating under the brand name Serena. Serena hotels and \nlodges contribute to the local economy by training skilled labor, reinvigoration of artisans and \ncraft  industries,  and  sensitive  conservation  or  development  of  the  surrounding  area.  This \nincludes prioritizing hiring and training of local residents for employment at all levels of the \norganization.  \n \n12.  Tourism Promotion Services often seeks to develop properties in less-traveled areas \nthat require accommodation of an international standard\u2014accommodation that supports tourism \nand business development\u2014but which often are ignored by commercial hotel chains.  \n \n13.  At each hotel, the policy is to minimize the impact on the local environment while \nseeking to maximize socioeconomic benefits to the local economy. In Tanzania, for example, \nbefore the creation of new facilities in the country\u2019s national parks, four environmental impact \nstudies were carried out. The Serena Hotel in Mombasa maintains a sanctuary for indigenous \nbutterflies and works with local residents on a program to protect sea turtle nesting sites. These \nmeasures have earned the Serena hotels numerous environmental awards.  \n \nc.  Industry  \n14.  AKFED has invested in and manages over 50 industrial project companies in Africa and \nAsia. In the early 1960s, a group of companies was set up under the corporate name Industrial \nPromotion Services (IPS). Each company was created to provide venture capital, technical \nassistance, and management support to encourage and expand private enterprise in countries \nof sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Growth, privatization, and a reorientation away from \nimport substitution and toward export promotion resulted in adjustments to IPS\u2019s approach. \nExpansion into areas such as agribusiness, packaging, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa \nwas accompanied by the need for new investments in the emerging economies of Central Asia \nin the 1990s and the current decade, in particular, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Today, IPS \ncompanies play a vital role in local and regional economies.  \n \nd.  Food and Agroprocessing  \n15.  One of IPS\u2019s core operational sectors, agroprocessing, includes companies that supply \ngoods for local and export markets. They also play a significant role in supporting the rural \neconomy.  In  Kenya,  for  example,  Frigoken  provides  agricultural  extension  services  to \n25,000 Kenyan bean farmers. The beans are processed and exported to European markets. ", "Appendix 5  45 \nLoans are provided to the farmers by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance to assist \nthem with financial needs that arise before receiving harvest revenues.  \n \n16.  In  West  Africa,  AKFED  supplies  agricultural  extension  services  to  more  than \n45,000 cotton  farmers,  operates  cotton  ginneries,  and  exports  finished  products.  Its  social \nprograms offer microfinance, education, health, and sanitation to the farmers.  \n \n17.  In addition to promoting the employment of women, these companies have become \nnational role models in matters of employee welfare, including the provision of child care and \nhealth care.  \n \ne.  Infrastructure  \n18.  AKFED  works  with  governments,  international  corporations,  international  financial \ninstitutions, and funding agencies to create solutions to pressing infrastructure needs, including \npower generation, telecommunications, and water supply services. AKFED\u2019s first investment in \nthe power sector, the $225 million Azito energy project in the Ivory Coast, was the largest \nprivate sector power plant in sub-Saharan Africa. It was followed by the Tsavo power plant in \nMombasa,  Kenya\u2019s  first  privately  financed  \u201copen-bid\u201d  project  and  the  first  such  plant \nsuccessfully constructed under an updated and more stringent environmental law.  \n \n19.  AKFED  is  also  working  with  partners  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  a  Soviet-era \nhydroelectric  power  plant  that  will  boost  the  eastern  province  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  inadequate \nelectricity supply, reduce deforestation, and contribute to the region\u2019s economic recovery. In \nUganda, AKFED is leading the $500 million, 220-megawatt Bujagali Hydro Power Project to \nproduce critically needed electricity for the country, and for neighboring Kenya.  \n \n20.  AKFED\u2019s initial involvement in building telecommunications infrastructure was in Indigo, \na  global  system  for  mobile  communications  (GSM)  mobile  phone  operation  in  Tajikistan. \nSubsequently, AKFED was awarded Afghanistan\u2019s second GSM license and created Roshan, \nwhich is today one of the largest employers in the country. AKFED is also a key partner in the \ndevelopment of Seacom, a submarine cable that will connect countries located in the Eastern \npart of Africa to Europe. \n \nf.  Media Services  \n21.  The Nation Media Group, founded by the Aga Khan in 1960, has its origins in Kenya\u2019s \nTaifa and Nation newspapers, which were set up to provide independent voices during the \nyears just before the country\u2019s independence. Majority-owned and run by Kenyans, the Nation \nMedia  Group\u2019s  operations  include  a  growing  number  of  English  and  Kiswahili  national \nnewspapers, a regional weekly, and radio and television stations. In recent years, the group has \nexpanded its operations into Uganda and Tanzania.  \n \ng.  Aviation Services  \n22.  The aim of the aviation division is to maintain the critical aviation infrastructure in support \nof economic development. The division provides investment, management, and operational \nexpertise  and  training.  AKFED  has  taken  a  majority  stake  in  Air  Burkina,  as  part  of  a \ngovernment privatization plan designed to ensure the long-term viability of the airline. AKFED \nalso launched airlines in Mali (2005) and in Uganda (2007) to increase capacity in West and \nEast Africa. \n ", "46  Appendix 5 \n  \n2.  Monaco Telecom International \n23.  Monaco Telecom Group holds 36.75% of Roshan through its wholly owned subsidiary \nMonaco Telecom International (MTI).  \n \n24.  Monaco Telecom Group was created in 1997 and is the incumbent operator for the \nPrincipality of Monaco.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project will address remaining unmet demand for affordable telecom services in semi-urban and rural areas. Increasing \nthe telephone density in a war-torn country such as Afghanistan is vital to the national reconstruction efforts. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nEstablishment of additional base transceiver stations (BTSs) will ensure that mobile telephone service reach almost all semi-\nurban and major areas to reach significant levels of population coverage, in order to offer more affordable mobile telephone \nservices. Additional public call offices will also be installed for those who cannot afford mobile phones. \n \n2. Design Features. The Project will provide indirect benefits to the communities in general, and provide income-earning \nopportunities to the rural communities where the BTSs are located.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected.   Not applicable \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them.  Not applicable \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. Not applicable \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nCommunities in the vicinity of the project areas will benefit from the availability of income-earning opportunities, e.g., income \nfrom leased land for 5\u201315 years and employment opportunities during construction of the BTSs. Improving communication \nfacilities in the area will provide access to public service delivery, education, health, and security. Roshan will also provide \ndirect training, employment, and business opportunities in underdeveloped areas, to staff, dealers, and subcontractors, \nincluding through the MicroReach program, targeted at women.  \n \nAbout 700 BTSs in 60 districts will be installed either on rooftops or on the ground on leased lands in urban areas and \nsparsely populated desert lands in rural areas. A typical BTS requires 144 square meters of land space. Sites will be leased \non a willing lessor-willing lessee basis. \n \nAlthough there are a number of ethnic groups in Afghanistan (e.g., the Kuchi, Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbek, Aimaks, \nTurkmen, Baloch, Brahui, Hindkowans, etc.), none of these ethnic groups will be affected as BTSs will be installed mostly on \nleased lands in urban areas and sparsely populated desert lands in rural areas.
