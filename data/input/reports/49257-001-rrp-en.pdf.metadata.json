The  project  will  include  a  capacity  development \nprogram to develop an effective road safety program and enhance the government\u2019s capacity in \nroad  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  EWH  corridor,  which  will  include  several  major \nbridges and tunnels after completion, requiring a new O&M approach.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCountry\u2019s  strategic  location.  Located  at  the  crossroads  of  Central  West  Asia  and \nEastern Europe and bounded to the west by the Black Sea, Georgia has historically been a trade \ncenter. It played a key role in the movement of peoples and goods from the Russian Federation \nin the north to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey and onwards to Iran in the south, and from Europe \nin the west to Asia in the east. After Georgia\u2019s admission to CAREC in 2016, the EWH has been \nan integral part of one of the six key CAREC corridors providing the shortest transit link connecting \nCentral  Asia  with  Europe  and  East  Asia.  Since  the  mid-2000s,  Georgia  has  significantly \ndeveloped  its  transport system,  infrastructure,  and  service  delivery  through  the  construction  of \nroads,  railways,  port  terminals,  and  airports.  Following  its  Georgia  2020  socioeconomic \ndevelopment strategy, the government is committed to develop the country as a regional transport \nand logistics hub for trade1 between Europe and Central Asia and even East Asia. The project fits \nwith the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 It is consistent \nwith the strategic objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u20132018 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Georgia, 2018\u20132020.3 \n \nRegional transport corridor and road network. The road network in Georgia extends \n4. \nto approximately 22,000 km with 6,835 km of international and secondary roads managed by the \nRoads Department under the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) and \nabout 15,000 km of local roads managed by district administrations. The main highway network \ncomprises the East\u2013West and the North\u2013South corridors. The EWH, stretching over 410 km from \nSarpi on the Black Sea, at the border with Turkey, through the center of the country to the capital \nTbilisi  and  on  to  the  border  with  Azerbaijan,  is  a  top  priority  of  the  Government\u2019s  transport \ninfrastructure development. The EWH represents about 2% of Georgia's road network length, one \nfourth  of  its  international  road  network  and  carries  over  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  foreign  trade. \nThe EWH serves 13,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on average, with a traffic growth rate of over 10% \nper  annum  since  2005.  The  EWH  is  not  only  crucial  for  the  connectivity  of  international  trade \nbetween  the  Caspian  Sea  and  the  Black  Sea,  but  also  essential  for  Georgia\u2019s  global  market \naccess and socioeconomic development. Developing the EWH is also of great significance to the \nlandlocked countries of Central Asia and will have an important regional impact. \n                                                \n1  Government of Georgia. 2014.

In  2009,  ADB  approved  a  $500  million  multitranche  financing  facility \n5. \n(MFF) for the Road Corridor Investment Program to assist the government in upgrading two key \nsections of the EWH.4 The tranche 1 project ($118.8 million, approved in 2009) was to construct \na new 28 km two-lane bypass road skirting Kobuleti. The tranche 2 project ($150 million, approved \nin 2010) was to construct a new 14 km two-lane bypass road skirting Batumi. An updated cost \nestimate, prepared in 2011 as part of the detailed design, exceeded the original cost estimate, \nwhich had been based on the preliminary design. In November 2011, the government requested \nadditional financing of $140 million through a tranche 3 project to make up for the shortage of \nfinancing5 the Kobuleti bypass (tranche 1) and simultaneously canceled tranche 2. The Kobuleti \nbypass is now complete and the road opened to traffic in June 2018. In 2017, ADB approved a \n$114 million loan, with another $114 million of cofinancing provided by the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment  Bank, to  construct the  Batumi  bypass.6 The civil  works  are  ongoing.  In  2017,  ADB \napproved an $80 million loan to construct the Dzirula\u2013Kharagauli\u2013Moliti road in Central Georgia \nto  a  two-lane  all-weather  standard,  which  improves  connectivity  to  remote  poor  areas. 7 This \nsecondary road runs parallel to the EWH and connects Kharagauli to the EWH. The civil works \ncontract for the first section has been awarded and procurement for the second section is ongoing. \nThe reconstruction of the Kvesheti\u2013Kobi section of the North\u2013South corridor is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan and project preparation is ongoing. This project, together with \nother projects in the pipeline (Tbilisi bypass, and Batumi\u2013Sarpi), will support the government\u2019s \nobjective to complete the main road network.  \n \n6. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will provide a study to ensure that a proper \nand effective maintenance strategy adapted to a high-level service highway corridor with multiple \ncomplex structures is implemented. Further, a climate risk vulnerability assessment was carried \nout under ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) for 9211-GEO. The design recommendations arising \nfrom the climate risk vulnerability assessment were mostly incorporated into the detailed design. \nBoth measures, which intend to increase the sustainability of the investment, would not have been \nincorporated without ADB support.  \n \n7. \nDevelopment  coordination. Georgia  has  been successful  in mobilizing financing from \nother development partners including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. Major development partners \nhave  committed  to  financing  the  remaining  last  section  of  the  EWH.  The  five  subsections  are \ndefined as F0, F1, F2, F3, and F4 in the project\u2019s feasibility study. The World Bank and EIB are \nfinancing subsections F0 and F1. ADB has financed the detailed design for subsections F2, F3, \nand  F4  through  an  MFF  (footnote  4),  while  financing  for  implementing  subsection  F2  is  being \nprovided by ADB, subsection F3 by the EIB, and subsection F4 by JICA. Although each partner \nwill be responsible for the respective sections in parallel, they will coordinate to the extent possible \nand as required to ensure smooth implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\n5  The  updated  cost  estimate  increased  substantially  due  to  (i)  alignment  changes  made  to  avoid  significant \nresettlement impacts, which resulted in additional tunnels and bridges; and (ii) increased global commodity prices, \nwhich led to considerable increases in the cost of construction materials.  \n\n6  ADB.  2017.

At the end of 2017, 40% of the EWH had already been completed: \n8. \nabout 170 km had been upgraded and 110 km were under construction. One important missing \nlink is the 53 km section (covering subsections from F1 to F4) between Chumateleti and Argveta. \nImprovements are either completed or underway on each side of this section. Because of difficult \nand  unstable  terrain,  the  project  road  (subsection  F2  \u2013  Khevi\u2013Ubisa  Section)  remained \nuntouched. The existing two-lane road is a mountainous winding road prone to landslides. Cars, \nbuses, and trucks need to reduce their speed by 20%\u201325% when traveling on this stretch of the \nroad.  The  heavy  transit  traffic  also  poses  environmental  and  safety  problems  for  the  local \npopulation and tourists using the road. Preliminary impact studies on completed sections of the \nEWH found that the vehicle operating costs of cars were reduced by 15% and of trucks by 6.6%, \nand transit time was reduced by 32%. Fatalities from road crashes were 43% less. Given that \n75% of the project road length will be located either on a bridge or in a tunnel because of the \nchallenging terrain, pedestrians are not expected to use the road and there is no space for small-\nscale businesses on the roadside, which will improve road safety significantly. To minimize the \noverall  cost  of  transport  and  logistics,  all  bottlenecks  constraining  traffic  capacity  on  the  EWH \nneed to be mitigated. The completed EWH will be an essential link both at national and regional \nlevels.  Moreover,  a  World  Bank  study8 shows  other  impacts  as  well,  including  a  reduction  in \ntransportation  costs  after  corridor  improvements,  which  will  be  more  beneficial  for  the  rural \npopulation who are more reliant on transportation and sensitive to price changes. However, the \nfinancial viability is not strong enough to attract private sector funds for financing and operation \nof the road, given the high investment costs of the project. So far, the government has constructed \nand operated the highway network through public sector funding without tolling. \n \n9. \nRoad safety. Institutional development of the transport sector is essential to a competitive \ncorridor  development.  Some  positive  developments  in  road  safety  have  occurred  in  the  past \ndecade,  with  road  fatalities  rate  declining  from  20  fatalities  per  100,000  persons  in  2008  to \n13 fatalities  in  2015. This remains four  times  higher than  the  best  performers  in  the  European \nUnion.9 Road crashes cost Georgia about 1%\u20132% of its gross domestic product (GDP), and about \n20% of all road crashes happen on the EWH. The government approved a new National Road \nSafety Strategy in July 2016, prepared through World Bank financing. Following this approval, an \ninteragency road safety commission was established. ADB assistance will support initiatives of \nthe  strategy  during  next  few  years  by  helping  Georgia  address  road  safety  issues  during  the \nextensive  period  of  construction  activities  on  the  EWH,  including  rehabilitation  of  the  parallel \nsecondary road. \n \n10. \nPreservation  of  road  assets.  Since  2005,  the  government  has  revised  rules  and \nregulations  to  respond  to  transport  needs.  This  has  helped  attract  private  capital  to  aviation, \nmaritime services, pipelines, and railways. The road sector remains owned and operated by the \npublic sector. The government\u2019s public expenditure has increased by 13% annually to meet the \nneeds of EWH improvement. Yet the budget allocations for road maintenance received only 6% \nincrease annually. Nevertheless, the Roads Department has made good progress in resolving its \ncurrent maintenance backlog in the last five years and has prepared a 5-year plan (2018\u20132022) \nto  address  most  of  the  network  needs.  Establishing  a  reliable  funding  mechanism  is  a  key \nchallenge, to allow timely and regular road maintenance, and to ensure road asset sustainability. \nComponents targeting this concern were included in each on-going ADB assistance such as the \nimplementation  of  performance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contracts  aimed  at  improving  the \nefficiency of the maintenance budget. The PBM component is building on a successful WB pilot \n\n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2015.

The Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, Geneva. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fprogram currently under implementation, comprising 5 years contracts. The project will address \nthis challenge by supporting the Roads Department to develop an O&M system of the highways \nin  Georgia,  including  the  EWH  corridor.  Dialogue  with  the  government,  in  liaison  with  other \nfinanciers of the corridor, will be pursued to provide broad support to the government. \n \n11. \nProject management. The Roads Department\u2019s technical and managerial capacity is key \nto  ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  the  project  considering  the  project\u2019s  technical \ncomplexity,  and  the  growing  road  investment  program.  The  Roads  Department\u2019s  capacity  is \nalready stretched and it needs to be further strengthened to conduct day-to-day management of \nthe project from a technical point of view. In particular, the level of relevant technical experience \nneeds to be improved in project management, bridge, tunnel, and geotechnical engineering. \n \nLessons. The capacity for managing land acquisition and resettlement has seen major \n12. \nimprovements,  demonstrated  in  the  implementation  of  the  Batumi  bypass  and  the  Secondary \nRoad Improvement projects (footnotes 6 and 7). However, a small number of affected people may \ndecline  relocation,  which  may  result  in  lengthy  disputes  outside  of  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism,  and  thereby  disrupt  construction  works.  This  has  been  addressed  during  project \npreparation by consultations with nongovernment organizations and local residents to explain the \nlegal framework allowing involuntary land acquisition and expropriation for public purposes; this \nwill continue during project implementation. The Roads Department will also closely coordinate \nwith law enforcement agencies to avoid indefinite grievance cases that affect construction works. \nExecuting  agencies  in  the  region,  including  the  Roads  Department  in  Georgia,  have  recently \nexperienced  several  cases  where  the  lowest  bid  prices  for  civil  works  were  abnormally  low \ncompared to cost estimates. This raises concerns in respect of the bidder\u2019s ability to perform the \ncontract successfully. To mitigate this risk, the new ADB Procurement Policy \u2013 Goods, Works, \nNonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  \u2013  Goods,  Works,  Nonconsulting  and  Consulting \nServices (2017 as amended from time to time) will apply for the project. New regulations provide \na mechanism to exclude an abnormally low bid or make it subject to certain conditions. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project is aligned with the following impact: Georgia is a regional and logistics hub \n13. \nand  more  attractive  for  businesses  (footnote  1).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nefficiency and safety of road transport along the EWH improved. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutput 2: Road safety awareness increased.

It is currently the \nexecuting agency for the ongoing MFF (footnote 4) and two stand-alone loans (footnotes 6 and \n7) and has a sound understanding of ADB policies and procedures. The Roads Department, an \nagency  under  the  MRDI,  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  Eurasian  Transport  Corridor \nInvestment  Center  (ETCIC)  of  the  MRDI  will  be  assisting  the  Roads  Department  with  project \nfinancial management activities. \n\n23. \nThe procurement of the works and the selection of consultant services will follow the new \nprocurement framework as set out in ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy for the procurement of goods, \nworks,  consulting  services  and  non-consulting  services  (2017)  as  well  as  the  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017).14 Advance contracting and retroactive financing will be \nsought to ensure the readiness of the project. The government has been advised that advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  do  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.  The  project  is \ncategorized as a procurement- and design-ready project.

The  median  width  varies \ndepending on the terrain. The design speed is 100 km per hour, with some segments reduced to \n80 km per hour in mountainous sections to improve road safety. The road design was carried out \nin accordance with the Standard on Geometrical and Structural Requirements for the Public Motor \nRoads of Georgia with reference to relevant clauses of the Trans-European Motorway standards. \nBecause of mountainous terrain and the design standard adopted, only short sections will follow \nthe existing alignment. Frontage roads, two interchanges and access roads to these interchanges \nwill maintain the existing local traffic along the project highway. The mountainous terrain requires \nconstruction of 35 bridges with a total length of 8.3 km and 20 tunnels with a total length of 9.4 \nkm (for both directions cumulatively), making the project technically highly complex. Tunnels are \ndesigned in accordance with the European Parliament and Council directives. \n \n25. \nThe  detailed  design  of  the  project,  including  bill  of  quantities  (BOQ),  draft  bidding \ndocuments, an environmental impact assessment, and a land acquisition and resettlement plan \nis being carried out under ADB\u2019s ongoing Loan 2843-GEO.15 The consultants recruited through \nADB\u2019s  TA  for  9211-GEO  (i)  carried  out  an  independent  proof  check  of  the  detailed  design  to \nensure  quality  of  the  major  items  such  as  tunnels,  bridges,  deep  cuttings,  climate  change \nadaptation,  and  draft  bidding  documents;  (ii)  ensured  the  overall  consistency  between  design \ndrawings and the BOQ; and (iii) prepared the road safety audit of the design, sector assessment \nand the project\u2019s economic and financial management assessment. Based on the due diligence \nconducted,  the  detailed  design  is  consistent  with  the  design  standards,  and  the  BOQ  is \nreasonably accurate, with sufficient contingencies to mitigate project risks. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nEconomic.  The  project  will  expand  Georgia\u2019s  transit  capacity  and  provide  enhanced \nsafety  features.  It  will  reduce  transport  costs  and  provide  much-needed  additional  capacity. \n\n                                                \n15 ADB.  (2009).  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \n\nFinancing Facility to Georgia for the Road Corridor Investment Program. Manila \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGeorgia  plans  to  capture  transport  cost  savings  and  use  them  to  generate  wider  economic \nbenefits, for example by establishing logistics centers along the EWH. The economic evaluation \nof the project followed ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and made use of \nthe Highway Development and Management Model version 4 (HDM-4).16 Base year (2017) traffic \nwas estimated at 14,462 vpd, of which 8% were truck-trailers. During 2007\u20132016 traffic grew at \n9% per year, approximately double the growth rate of GDP over the same period. Acknowledging \nthe various influences on traffic growth, including diversion of some passenger traffic to rail, the \nweighted  average  traffic  growth  rate  from  2018  to  2041  was  estimated  at  3.9%,  implying  an \nincome elasticity of 1.0 with respect to forecast GDP growth over the same period. The new port \nat Anaklia, currently in its first phase of development, is expected to add an additional 150 vpd in \n2022. The economic costs are (i) capital, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes; \nand (ii) O&M. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) journey time \nsavings, (iii) reduced vehicle emissions, and (iv) reduced crash costs. The results of the economic \nanalysis showed that the project is just economically viable with an estimated economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  9.2%. 17  Sensitivity  tests  confirmed  that  the  project  would  remain \neconomically viable should the envisaged project costs increase by less than 3%, or benefits be \nreduced to 98% or less. However, the EIRR does not capture larger regional beneficial impacts \nwhich are difficult to quantify. \n \n27. \nFinancial. The MRDI is a general government sector unit and the project is nonrevenue \ngenerating.  The  project  road  will  be  maintained  under  the  government\u2019s  normal  routine \nmaintenance  program.  The  yearly  allocation  for  rehabilitation  and  routine  maintenance  for \ninternational and secondary roads of $5,000 per km per year will be adequate to maintain project \nroad function without undue damage. There remains a risk that the road maintenance budget will \nnot follow the growing needs of the maintenance because of the significant highway construction \nprogram of  the government.  However,  the government recognizes  this  issue  and  is  examining \nvarious  measures  to  address  it  (e.g.  through  increasing  funding  sources  and/or  increasing \nefficiency). In addition to providing support to the Roads Department to strengthen the existing \nO&M system of the highways, all development partners have been committed to provide support \nfor  the  government  to  further  strengthen  the  existing  road  asset  management  system  and  to \nreduce the maintenance backlog. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nThe procurement risk is rated medium based on a procurement risk assessment prepared \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Assessing  Procurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project \nProcurement Classification.18 The Roads Department is almost fully staffed (one position remains \nunfilled), functional and is currently implementing projects financed by ADB, the EIB, JICA, and \nthe  World  Bank.  The  Roads  Department  has  a  proven  track  record  in  adhering  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and bidding procedures in procurement of works contracts and ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  in  recruiting  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB. \nThe Roads Department has adequate capacity to ensure the successful procurement and efficient \nimplementation  of  the  project.  The  financial  management  assessment  prepared  under  the \nongoing TA activity concluded that the technical capacity of ETCIC meets ADB requirements for \nfinancial  management,  and  the  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  MRDI,  the  Roads \nDepartment,  and  ETCIC  have  up-to-date  and  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement policies and implementation procedures, acquired in part through extensive ADB \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2017.

The MRDI has sufficient capacity in financial management, \nwithin  the  government\u2019s  budgetary  procedures,  for  the  recurrent  expenditures  required  for \nmaintaining  and  operating  the  project  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Overall,  there  are  only  limited \nfiduciary risks and such risks will be mitigated by implementing capacity building support to the \nRoads Department. \n\n29. \nGeorgia\u2019s  anticorruption  regulatory  framework  is  outlined  in  the  Law  of  Georgia  on  the \nConflict  of  Interests  and  Corruption  in  Public  Service,  2009.  The  Investigative  Division  of  the \nProsecution  Service  is  the  key  anticorruption  body.  The  Anti-Corruption  Interagency  Council \nunder the Ministry of Justice of Georgia is tasked with coordinating anticorruption efforts. Georgia \nadopted  its  inaugural  National  Anti-Corruption  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  in  2005.  Georgia  is  a \nleader  in  anticorruption  among  non-Baltic,  former  Soviet  Union  countries.  While  Georgia  has \nexperienced some important legal improvements to further strengthen this development during \nrecent  years,  limited  enforcement  of  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  hinders  further \nprogress. 19  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  MRDI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nThere are three communities with a total of 17 villages in the project area, consisting of \n30. \n1,266 households with 4,498 residents, who are mainly poor. Many of the men work in Tbilisi, \nusually with incomes of GEL20\u2013GEL25 per day. Most of the women are self-employed: selling \nfruits, vegetables and other agriculture products, either on the side of the current roads or in the \nweekly market in Khashuri. Walking is the main form of transportation, and a few privately run \nminibuses offer alternative transportation. Many residents, including students attending schools \nin adjoining communities, hitch rides with private cars. The project is expected to provide benefits \nto surrounding communities by improving their mobility and better ensuring their access to basic \neducational and health services, as well as employment opportunities. Women\u2019s direct benefits \nfrom the project will derive from specific targeted actions such as: (i) providing access to livelihood \nopportunities, through allocation of commercial spaces for women entrepreneurs; (ii) conducting \nlivelihood  trainings  for  surrounding  communities;  (iii)  ensuring  women\u2019s  equal  and  meaningful \nparticipation in all consultation meetings; (iv) improving safe accessibility of pedestrians, most of \nwhom  are  women  and  children,  with  well-lit  sheds,  zebra  crossings,  and  ample  safety  signs; \n(v)  ensuring  women\u2019s  meaningful  participation \nroad  safety  campaign  programs; \n(vi)  engendering  of  the  road  maintenance  sustainability  strategy,  and  the  national  road  safety \naction plan, and (vii) providing technical training of women in project management, among others. \n \n31. \nThe gender categorization of the project is effective gender mainstreaming. The Roads \nDepartment will engage a gender specialist to ensure the quality and timely implementation of the \nproject gender action plan. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nin \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\n32. \nsafeguard categories are as follows. 20 \n \n\n                                                \n19 Transparency International. 2018.

The  project  will  have  significant  adverse  impacts  that  are \n33. \nirreversible and diverse. The alignment will be partially new and will require significant amounts \nof  tunneling  and  bridge  building  activities. Works  will  require  construction  in  the  Dzirula  River, \nresulting in the loss of natural habitat with significant community impacts from resettlement and \nland conversion. Tunneling will require disposal of spoil during construction in the region of 1.9 \nmillion cubic m. Impacts on noise, vibration, air quality, traffic and surface water will occur during \nconstruction. The short-term nature of impacts mean that impacts will generally not be significant \nif mitigation is implemented correctly. During operation, the road will improve local road safety by \ntaking through traffic off the local roads. However, noise impacts from the new alignment will be \nsignificant,  requiring  targeted  mitigation  and  potential  resettlement  to  ensure  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  As  part  of  environmental  impact  assessment,21 a  detailed \nanalysis of noise impacts has been conducted and mitigation measures in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement have been proposed. The Roads Department has the expertise to \nadequately  manage  the  contractors\u2019  environmental  performance.  However,  given  the  size  and \nscope of existing and upcoming projects, it is recommended that the Roads Department further \nstrengthen  its  capacity  by  hiring  additional  specialists  to  provide  oversight  of  environmental, \nhealth, and safety issues of the highway projects. \n \n34. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Approximately  160  households,  comprising \nmore  than  200  people  will  be  severely  affected  either  through  physical  displacement \n(39 households) or through the loss of 10% or more of productive assets. A resettlement plan has \nbeen disclosed on the ADB website. Some people will lose direct access to the highway after the \nproject completion. All affected people and affected households are identified in the resettlement \nplan and appropriate compensation included therein. The Roads Department has experience with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for road projects under similar conditions and in similar terrain. \nThe  Roads  Department  resettlement  division  is  well  staffed  and  experienced  in  preparing  and \nimplementing resettlement plans in large and complex projects, both in rural and urban settings. \n \n35. \narea, as defined by the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
