THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nGeorgia for the East\u2013West Highway (Khevi\u2013Ubisa Section) Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The project will construct 12 kilometers (km) of new access-controlled dual two-lane \ncarriageway road or a four-lane divided highway, partly on a new alignment, on the East\u2013West \nHighway (EWH) between Khevi and Ubisa, which is part of Corridor 2 of the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program. The project will include a capacity development \nprogram to develop an effective road safety program and enhance the government\u2019s capacity in \nroad operation and maintenance (O&M) of the EWH corridor, which will include several major \nbridges and tunnels after completion, requiring a new O&M approach.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Country\u2019s strategic location. Located at the crossroads of Central West Asia and \nEastern Europe and bounded to the west by the Black Sea, Georgia has historically been a trade \ncenter. It played a key role in the movement of peoples and goods from the Russian Federation \nin the north to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey and onwards to Iran in the south, and from Europe \nin the west to Asia in the east. After Georgia\u2019s admission to CAREC in 2016, the EWH has been \nan integral part of one of the six key CAREC corridors providing the shortest transit link connecting \nCentral  Asia  with  Europe  and  East  Asia.  Since  the  mid-2000s,  Georgia  has  significantly \ndeveloped its transport system, infrastructure, and service delivery through the construction of \nroads,  railways,  port  terminals,  and  airports.  Following  its  Georgia  2020  socioeconomic \ndevelopment strategy, the government is committed to develop the country as a regional transport \nand logistics hub for trade1 between Europe and Central Asia and even East Asia. The project fits \nwith the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 It is consistent \nwith the strategic objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u20132018 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Georgia, 2018\u20132020.3 \n \n4.  Regional transport corridor and road network. The road network in Georgia extends \nto approximately 22,000 km with 6,835 km of international and secondary roads managed by the \nRoads Department under the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) and \nabout 15,000 km of local roads managed by district administrations. The main highway network \ncomprises the East\u2013West and the North\u2013South corridors. The EWH, stretching over 410 km from \nSarpi on the Black Sea, at the border with Turkey, through the center of the country to the capital \nTbilisi and on to the border with Azerbaijan, is a top priority of the Government\u2019s transport \ninfrastructure development. The EWH represents about 2% of Georgia's road network length, one \nfourth of its international road network and carries over 60% of the country\u2019s foreign trade. \nThe EWH serves 13,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on average, with a traffic growth rate of over 10% \nper annum since 2005. The EWH is not only crucial for the connectivity of international trade \nbetween the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, but also essential for Georgia\u2019s global market \naccess and socioeconomic development. Developing the EWH is also of great significance to the \nlandlocked countries of Central Asia and will have an important regional impact. \n                                                \n1  Government of Georgia. 2014.

ADB assistance. In 2009, ADB approved a $500 million multitranche financing facility \n(MFF) for the Road Corridor Investment Program to assist the government in upgrading two key \nsections of the EWH.4 The tranche 1 project ($118.8 million, approved in 2009) was to construct \na new 28 km two-lane bypass road skirting Kobuleti. The tranche 2 project ($150 million, approved \nin 2010) was to construct a new 14 km two-lane bypass road skirting Batumi. An updated cost \nestimate, prepared in 2011 as part of the detailed design, exceeded the original cost estimate, \nwhich had been based on the preliminary design. In November 2011, the government requested \nadditional financing of $140 million through a tranche 3 project to make up for the shortage of \nfinancing5 the Kobuleti bypass (tranche 1) and simultaneously canceled tranche 2. The Kobuleti \nbypass is now complete and the road opened to traffic in June 2018. In 2017, ADB approved a \n$114 million loan, with another $114 million of cofinancing provided by the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, to construct the Batumi bypass.6 The civil works are ongoing. In 2017, ADB \napproved an $80 million loan to construct the Dzirula\u2013Kharagauli\u2013Moliti road in Central Georgia \nto a two-lane all-weather standard, which improves connectivity to remote poor areas.7 This \nsecondary road runs parallel to the EWH and connects Kharagauli to the EWH. The civil works \ncontract for the first section has been awarded and procurement for the second section is ongoing. \nThe reconstruction of the Kvesheti\u2013Kobi section of the North\u2013South corridor is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan and project preparation is ongoing. This project, together with \nother projects in the pipeline (Tbilisi bypass, and Batumi\u2013Sarpi), will support the government\u2019s \nobjective to complete the main road network.  \n \n6.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will provide a study to ensure that a proper \nand effective maintenance strategy adapted to a high-level service highway corridor with multiple \ncomplex structures is implemented. Further, a climate risk vulnerability assessment was carried \nout under ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) for 9211-GEO. The design recommendations arising \nfrom the climate risk vulnerability assessment were mostly incorporated into the detailed design. \nBoth measures, which intend to increase the sustainability of the investment, would not have been \nincorporated without ADB support.  \n \n7.  Development coordination. Georgia has been successful in mobilizing financing from \nother development partners including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. Major development partners \nhave committed to financing the remaining last section of the EWH. The five subsections are \ndefined as F0, F1, F2, F3, and F4 in the project\u2019s feasibility study. The World Bank and EIB are \nfinancing subsections F0 and F1. ADB has financed the detailed design for subsections F2, F3, \nand F4 through an MFF (footnote 4), while financing for implementing subsection F2 is being \nprovided by ADB, subsection F3 by the EIB, and subsection F4 by JICA. Although each partner \nwill be responsible for the respective sections in parallel, they will coordinate to the extent possible \nand as required to ensure smooth implementation. \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n5  The  updated  cost  estimate  increased  substantially  due  to  (i)  alignment  changes  made  to  avoid significant \nresettlement impacts, which resulted in additional tunnels and bridges; and (ii) increased global commodity prices, \nwhich led to considerable increases in the cost of construction materials.  \n6  ADB. 2017.

At the end of 2017, 40% of the EWH had already been completed: \nabout 170 km had been upgraded and 110 km were under construction. One important missing \nlink is the 53 km section (covering subsections from F1 to F4) between Chumateleti and Argveta. \nImprovements are either completed or underway on each side of this section. Because of difficult \nand  unstable  terrain,  the  project  road  (subsection  F2  \u2013  Khevi\u2013Ubisa  Section)  remained \nuntouched. The existing two-lane road is a mountainous winding road prone to landslides. Cars, \nbuses, and trucks need to reduce their speed by 20%\u201325% when traveling on this stretch of the \nroad. The heavy transit traffic also poses environmental and safety problems for the local \npopulation and tourists using the road. Preliminary impact studies on completed sections of the \nEWH found that the vehicle operating costs of cars were reduced by 15% and of trucks by 6.6%, \nand transit time was reduced by 32%. Fatalities from road crashes were 43% less. Given that \n75% of the project road length will be located either on a bridge or in a tunnel because of the \nchallenging terrain, pedestrians are not expected to use the road and there is no space for small-\nscale businesses on the roadside, which will improve road safety significantly. To minimize the \noverall cost of transport and logistics, all bottlenecks constraining traffic capacity on the EWH \nneed to be mitigated. The completed EWH will be an essential link both at national and regional \nlevels. Moreover, a World Bank study8 shows other impacts as well, including a reduction in \ntransportation costs after corridor improvements, which will be more beneficial for the rural \npopulation who are more reliant on transportation and sensitive to price changes. However, the \nfinancial viability is not strong enough to attract private sector funds for financing and operation \nof the road, given the high investment costs of the project. So far, the government has constructed \nand operated the highway network through public sector funding without tolling. \n \n9.  Road safety. Institutional development of the transport sector is essential to a competitive \ncorridor development. Some positive developments in road safety have occurred in the past \ndecade, with road fatalities rate declining from 20 fatalities per 100,000 persons in 2008 to \n13 fatalities in 2015. This remains four times higher than the best performers in the European \nUnion.9 Road crashes cost Georgia about 1%\u20132% of its gross domestic product (GDP), and about \n20% of all road crashes happen on the EWH. The government approved a new National Road \nSafety Strategy in July 2016, prepared through World Bank financing. Following this approval, an \ninteragency road safety commission was established. ADB assistance will support initiatives of \nthe strategy during next few years by helping Georgia address road safety issues during the \nextensive period of construction activities on the EWH, including rehabilitation of the parallel \nsecondary road. \n \n10.  Preservation  of  road  assets.  Since  2005,  the  government  has  revised  rules  and \nregulations to respond to transport needs. This has helped attract private capital to aviation, \nmaritime services, pipelines, and railways. The road sector remains owned and operated by the \npublic sector. The government\u2019s public expenditure has increased by 13% annually to meet the \nneeds of EWH improvement. Yet the budget allocations for road maintenance received only 6% \nincrease annually. Nevertheless, the Roads Department has made good progress in resolving its \ncurrent maintenance backlog in the last five years and has prepared a 5-year plan (2018\u20132022) \nto address most of the network needs. Establishing a reliable funding mechanism is a key \nchallenge, to allow timely and regular road maintenance, and to ensure road asset sustainability. \nComponents targeting this concern were included in each on-going ADB assistance such as the \nimplementation of performance-based maintenance (PBM) contracts aimed at improving the \nefficiency of the maintenance budget. The PBM component is building on a successful WB pilot \n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2015.

The Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, Geneva. \n ", "4 \nprogram currently under implementation, comprising 5 years contracts. The project will address \nthis challenge by supporting the Roads Department to develop an O&M system of the highways \nin Georgia, including the EWH corridor. Dialogue with the government, in liaison with other \nfinanciers of the corridor, will be pursued to provide broad support to the government. \n \n11.  Project management. The Roads Department\u2019s technical and managerial capacity is key \nto  ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  the  project  considering  the  project\u2019s  technical \ncomplexity, and the growing road investment program. The Roads Department\u2019s capacity is \nalready stretched and it needs to be further strengthened to conduct day-to-day management of \nthe project from a technical point of view. In particular, the level of relevant technical experience \nneeds to be improved in project management, bridge, tunnel, and geotechnical engineering. \n \n12.  Lessons. The capacity for managing land acquisition and resettlement has seen major \nimprovements, demonstrated in the implementation of the Batumi bypass and the Secondary \nRoad Improvement projects (footnotes 6 and 7). However, a small number of affected people may \ndecline  relocation,  which  may  result  in  lengthy  disputes  outside  of  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism, and thereby disrupt construction works. This has been addressed during project \npreparation by consultations with nongovernment organizations and local residents to explain the \nlegal framework allowing involuntary land acquisition and expropriation for public purposes; this \nwill continue during project implementation. The Roads Department will also closely coordinate \nwith law enforcement agencies to avoid indefinite grievance cases that affect construction works. \nExecuting agencies in the region, including the Roads Department in Georgia, have recently \nexperienced several cases where the lowest bid prices for civil works were abnormally low \ncompared to cost estimates. This raises concerns in respect of the bidder\u2019s ability to perform the \ncontract successfully. To mitigate this risk, the new ADB Procurement Policy \u2013 Goods, Works, \nNonconsulting  and  Consulting  Services  (2017  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \u2013 Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting \nServices (2017 as amended from time to time) will apply for the project. New regulations provide \na mechanism to exclude an abnormally low bid or make it subject to certain conditions. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: Georgia is a regional and logistics hub \nand more attractive for businesses (footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: \nefficiency and safety of road transport along the EWH improved. \nC.  Outputs \n14.  Output 1: 12-kilometer section of East\u2013West Highway between Khevi and Ubisa \nconstructed. The highway section will be access controlled dual carriageway or a four-lane \ndivided highway, partly on a new alignment. \n \n15.  Output 2: Road safety awareness increased. A road safety program for highways, with \ngender-inclusive provisions, will be developed and implemented. \n \n16.  Output 3: Capacity of Roads Department for operation and maintenance and project \nmanagement  improved.  Under  a  capacity  strengthening  program  developed  by  teams  of \nconsultants, (i) the existing O&M system of highways will be reviewed and strengthened, and \n(ii) training on project management for the Roads Department staff will be provided, including \nmainstreaming gender into these activities. \n ", "5 \nD.

The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac255,297,000 ($300.0 million)11 from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 11 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nregular lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges \nduring construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 18.75 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The government will \ncontribute $129.5 million to cover taxes, land acquisition, and resettlement costs.12 ADB will not \nfinance taxes. \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2.

The main adaptation measures are (i) reinforcement of bridge structures, \n(ii) additional slope stabilization, (iii) enhancement of drainage capacity, and (iv) additional \ntree/shrub planting.13 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The project\u2019s executing agency will be the MRDI, which is responsible for planning, \ndesigning, and maintaining all international and secondary roads in the country. It is currently the \nexecuting agency for the ongoing MFF (footnote 4) and two stand-alone loans (footnotes 6 and \n7) and has a sound understanding of ADB policies and procedures. The Roads Department, an \nagency under the MRDI, will be the implementing agency. The Eurasian Transport Corridor \nInvestment Center (ETCIC) of the MRDI will be assisting the Roads Department with project \nfinancial management activities. \n23.  The procurement of the works and the selection of consultant services will follow the new \nprocurement framework as set out in ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy for the procurement of goods, \nworks, consulting services and non-consulting services (2017) as well as the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017).14 Advance contracting and retroactive financing will be \nsought to ensure the readiness of the project. The government has been advised that advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance the project. The project is \ncategorized as a procurement- and design-ready project. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 10). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance, Deputy Minister (Chair) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure \n(iii)  Implementation agency  Roads Department \nProcurement  Civil works (OCB)  1 contract  $348.10 million \nConsulting services  Construction supervision  249 international person-months  $11.00 million \n(QCBS, 80:20)  and 476 national person-months \n  Road safety program  20 national person-months  $0.10 million \n(CQS) \n  Road maintenance  15 international person-months  $1.00 million \nsustainability strategy  and 30 national person-months \n(QCBS, 90:10) \n  Project management training  8 international person-months  $0.25 million \nprogram (CQS) \n                                                \n13 Details in Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/procurement-regulations-adb-borrowers. \n ", "7 \nAspects   Arrangements \n  Project management  42 national person-months  $0.12 million \nconsultant  \n  Safeguards monitoring  2 contracts (40 national person- $0.20 million \n  months) \n  Financial audit (LCS)  Lump-sum contract  $0.07 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount will be allowed for civil works \nadvance contracting  and consulting services expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness but not \nearlier than 12 months before loan signing.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The project road is an access-controlled dual carriageway four-lane international road with \na total width of 27.6 meters (m), including traffic lanes (four lanes of 3.75 m each), paved \nshoulders (8 m), median (3 m), and unpaved shoulders (1.6 m). The median width varies \ndepending on the terrain. The design speed is 100 km per hour, with some segments reduced to \n80 km per hour in mountainous sections to improve road safety. The road design was carried out \nin accordance with the Standard on Geometrical and Structural Requirements for the Public Motor \nRoads of Georgia with reference to relevant clauses of the Trans-European Motorway standards. \nBecause of mountainous terrain and the design standard adopted, only short sections will follow \nthe existing alignment. Frontage roads, two interchanges and access roads to these interchanges \nwill maintain the existing local traffic along the project highway. The mountainous terrain requires \nconstruction of 35 bridges with a total length of 8.3 km and 20 tunnels with a total length of 9.4 \nkm (for both directions cumulatively), making the project technically highly complex. Tunnels are \ndesigned in accordance with the European Parliament and Council directives. \n \n25.  The  detailed  design  of  the  project,  including  bill  of  quantities  (BOQ),  draft  bidding \ndocuments, an environmental impact assessment, and a land acquisition and resettlement plan \nis being carried out under ADB\u2019s ongoing Loan 2843-GEO.15 The consultants recruited through \nADB\u2019s TA for 9211-GEO (i) carried out an independent proof check of the detailed design to \nensure quality of the major items such as tunnels, bridges, deep cuttings, climate change \nadaptation, and draft bidding documents; (ii) ensured the overall consistency between design \ndrawings and the BOQ; and (iii) prepared the road safety audit of the design, sector assessment \nand the project\u2019s economic and financial management assessment. Based on the due diligence \nconducted,  the  detailed  design  is  consistent  with  the  design  standards,  and  the  BOQ  is \nreasonably accurate, with sufficient contingencies to mitigate project risks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic. The project will expand Georgia\u2019s transit capacity and provide enhanced \nsafety features. It will reduce transport costs and provide much-needed additional capacity. \n                                                \n15 ADB. (2009). Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to Georgia for the Road Corridor Investment Program. Manila \n ", "8 \nGeorgia plans to capture transport cost savings and use them to generate wider economic \nbenefits, for example by establishing logistics centers along the EWH. The economic evaluation \nof the project followed ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and made use of \nthe Highway Development and Management Model version 4 (HDM-4).16 Base year (2017) traffic \nwas estimated at 14,462 vpd, of which 8% were truck-trailers. During 2007\u20132016 traffic grew at \n9% per year, approximately double the growth rate of GDP over the same period. Acknowledging \nthe various influences on traffic growth, including diversion of some passenger traffic to rail, the \nweighted average traffic growth rate from 2018 to 2041 was estimated at 3.9%, implying an \nincome elasticity of 1.0 with respect to forecast GDP growth over the same period. The new port \nat Anaklia, currently in its first phase of development, is expected to add an additional 150 vpd in \n2022. The economic costs are (i) capital, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes; \nand (ii) O&M. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) journey time \nsavings, (iii) reduced vehicle emissions, and (iv) reduced crash costs. The results of the economic \nanalysis showed that the project is just economically viable with an estimated economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  9.2%.17 Sensitivity  tests  confirmed  that  the  project  would  remain \neconomically viable should the envisaged project costs increase by less than 3%, or benefits be \nreduced to 98% or less. However, the EIRR does not capture larger regional beneficial impacts \nwhich are difficult to quantify. \n \n27.  Financial. The MRDI is a general government sector unit and the project is nonrevenue \ngenerating.  The  project  road  will  be  maintained  under  the  government\u2019s  normal  routine \nmaintenance  program.  The  yearly  allocation  for  rehabilitation  and  routine  maintenance  for \ninternational and secondary roads of $5,000 per km per year will be adequate to maintain project \nroad function without undue damage. There remains a risk that the road maintenance budget will \nnot follow the growing needs of the maintenance because of the significant highway construction \nprogram of the government. However, the government recognizes this issue and is examining \nvarious measures to address it (e.g. through increasing funding sources and/or increasing \nefficiency). In addition to providing support to the Roads Department to strengthen the existing \nO&M system of the highways, all development partners have been committed to provide support \nfor the government to further strengthen the existing road asset management system and to \nreduce the maintenance backlog. \nC.  Governance \n28.  The procurement risk is rated medium based on a procurement risk assessment prepared \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guide on Assessing Procurement Risks and Determining Project \nProcurement Classification.18 The Roads Department is almost fully staffed (one position remains \nunfilled), functional and is currently implementing projects financed by ADB, the EIB, JICA, and \nthe World  Bank. The Roads  Department  has  a  proven  track  record  in  adhering  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and bidding procedures in procurement of works contracts and ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  in  recruiting  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB. \nThe Roads Department has adequate capacity to ensure the successful procurement and efficient \nimplementation  of  the  project.  The  financial  management  assessment  prepared  under  the \nongoing TA activity concluded that the technical capacity of ETCIC meets ADB requirements for \nfinancial management, and the financial management risk is moderate. The MRDI, the Roads \nDepartment,  and  ETCIC  have  up-to-date  and  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  financial \nmanagement policies and implementation procedures, acquired in part through extensive ADB \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2017.

The MRDI has sufficient capacity in financial management, \nwithin  the  government\u2019s  budgetary  procedures,  for  the  recurrent  expenditures  required  for \nmaintaining and operating the project in a sustainable manner. Overall, there are only limited \nfiduciary risks and such risks will be mitigated by implementing capacity building support to the \nRoads Department. \n29.  Georgia\u2019s anticorruption regulatory framework is outlined in the Law of Georgia on the \nConflict of Interests and Corruption in Public Service, 2009. The Investigative Division of the \nProsecution Service is the key anticorruption body. The Anti-Corruption Interagency Council \nunder the Ministry of Justice of Georgia is tasked with coordinating anticorruption efforts. Georgia \nadopted its inaugural National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan in 2005. Georgia is a \nleader in anticorruption among non-Baltic, former Soviet Union countries. While Georgia has \nexperienced some important legal improvements to further strengthen this development during \nrecent  years,  limited  enforcement  of  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  hinders  further \nprogress.19 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  MRDI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n30.  There are three communities with a total of 17 villages in the project area, consisting of \n1,266 households with 4,498 residents, who are mainly poor. Many of the men work in Tbilisi, \nusually with incomes of GEL20\u2013GEL25 per day. Most of the women are self-employed: selling \nfruits, vegetables and other agriculture products, either on the side of the current roads or in the \nweekly market in Khashuri. Walking is the main form of transportation, and a few privately run \nminibuses offer alternative transportation. Many residents, including students attending schools \nin adjoining communities, hitch rides with private cars. The project is expected to provide benefits \nto surrounding communities by improving their mobility and better ensuring their access to basic \neducational and health services, as well as employment opportunities. Women\u2019s direct benefits \nfrom the project will derive from specific targeted actions such as: (i) providing access to livelihood \nopportunities, through allocation of commercial spaces for women entrepreneurs; (ii) conducting \nlivelihood trainings for surrounding communities; (iii) ensuring women\u2019s equal and meaningful \nparticipation in all consultation meetings; (iv) improving safe accessibility of pedestrians, most of \nwhom are women and children, with well-lit sheds, zebra crossings, and ample safety signs; \n(v)  ensuring  women\u2019s  meaningful  participation  in  road  safety  campaign  programs; \n(vi) engendering of the road maintenance sustainability strategy, and the national road safety \naction plan, and (vii) providing technical training of women in project management, among others. \n \n31.  The gender categorization of the project is effective gender mainstreaming. The Roads \nDepartment will engage a gender specialist to ensure the quality and timely implementation of the \nproject gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.20 \n \n                                                \n19 Transparency International. 2018.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "10 \n33.  Environment (category A). The project will have significant adverse impacts that are \nirreversible and diverse. The alignment will be partially new and will require significant amounts \nof tunneling and bridge building activities. Works will require construction in the Dzirula River, \nresulting in the loss of natural habitat with significant community impacts from resettlement and \nland conversion. Tunneling will require disposal of spoil during construction in the region of 1.9 \nmillion cubic m. Impacts on noise, vibration, air quality, traffic and surface water will occur during \nconstruction. The short-term nature of impacts mean that impacts will generally not be significant \nif mitigation is implemented correctly. During operation, the road will improve local road safety by \ntaking through traffic off the local roads. However, noise impacts from the new alignment will be \nsignificant, requiring targeted mitigation and potential resettlement to ensure compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. As part of environmental impact assessment,21 a detailed \nanalysis of noise impacts has been conducted and mitigation measures in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement have been proposed. The Roads Department has the expertise to \nadequately manage the contractors\u2019 environmental performance. However, given the size and \nscope of existing and upcoming projects, it is recommended that the Roads Department further \nstrengthen its capacity by hiring additional specialists to provide oversight of environmental, \nhealth, and safety issues of the highway projects. \n \n34.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  Approximately  160  households,  comprising \nmore  than  200  people  will  be  severely  affected  either  through  physical  displacement \n(39 households) or through the loss of 10% or more of productive assets. A resettlement plan has \nbeen disclosed on the ADB website. Some people will lose direct access to the highway after the \nproject completion. All affected people and affected households are identified in the resettlement \nplan and appropriate compensation included therein. The Roads Department has experience with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for road projects under similar conditions and in similar terrain. \nThe Roads Department resettlement division is well staffed and experienced in preparing and \nimplementing resettlement plans in large and complex projects, both in rural and urban settings. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the project \narea, as defined by the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n36.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan presented in the PAM (footnote 10). \nThe risks are assessed as manageable by adopting mitigating measures, and the integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation.22 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe government lacks adequate  The Asian Development Bank has engaged 11 international specialists \ncapacity to facilitate and coordinate  to support the design review, and procurement of the project.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The  government,  MRDI,  and  the  Roads  Department  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, MRDI, \nand the Roads Department have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.
