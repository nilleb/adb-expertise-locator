Poverty \n\nloan  of  $50,000,000 \n\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka  \n \nThe  proposed  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program \n(RFSDP)  comprises  three  loans.  Two  loans  are  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  (OCR): \nto  support  policy  and \n(i) a  program \ninstitutional  reforms  in  the  rural  finance  sector;  and  (ii) a project \nloan  of  $10,000,000 for  rural  enterprise  development.  The  third \nloan  (also  a  project  loan)  of  Special  Drawing  Rights7,005,000 \ninstitutional \nis \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nstrengthening of rural finance institutions (RFIs).  \n \nPoverty Intervention \nThematic: Good governance, gender and development  \n \nCategory B. An initial environmental  examination was undertaken \nand the summary is a supplementary appendix.  \n \nNotwithstanding  average  economic  growth  of  nearly  5%  over  the \npast  two  decades,  almost  40%  of  the  population  is  poor  or \nvulnerable \nis  overwhelmingly  a  rural \nphenomenon,  as  roughly  88%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas. \nEmployment,  either  on-farm or nonfarm, is mainly in subsistence \nactivities  typical  of  poor  and  low-income  households.  Poverty \nreduction,  therefore,  is  the  central  objective  of  the  economic \nreform program of the Government of Sri Lanka.  \n \nA vibrant rural economy requires a robust rural finance sector that \ncan  efficiently  mobilize  and  allocate  resources  and  facilitate \nexchange  of  goods  and  services.  However,  the  rural  finance \nsector in Sri Lanka is highly fragmented and the RFIs suffer from \nweak governance, poor repayment rates, high transaction costs, \nweak supervision, and recurring losses. Instead of mainstreaming \ngood  governance  and  sustainability  as  core  values,  successive \ngovernments have adopted ad hoc and short-term measures that \nexacerbated the weaknesses. As a result, the demand and supply \ngap for rural credit amounts to Sri Lanka rupees (SLRs) 10 billion \n($103 million), of which half relates to rural poor households. \n \nThe  contribution  of  rural \nthrough \nfinance \ninvestments in agriculture and rural enterprises remains unfulfilled. \nto  weak  rural \nProduction  and  marketing  bottlenecks,  due \ninfrastructure  and  low  skill  levels,  reduce  the  profitability  of  the \nrural  sector,  which  remains  trapped  in  low-risk  and  low-return \ninvestments.  This  will  widen  income  gaps  within  rural  areas  and \nbetween  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  will  have  long-term negative \neffects on consumption and asset buildup, especially for rural poor \nhouseholds. \n\nto  rural  growth \n\n\fiv \n\nThe Program Loan  \nObjectives  \n\nComponents and \nOutputs  \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n(CRBs), \n\nregulatory \n\nrural  banks \n\n(ii) supportive \n\n \nRFSDP is designed to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  The  goal  is  to  enhance  outreach  of  sustainable  rural \nfinance  services.  The  objective  is  to establish a sustainable rural \nfinance  system  through  policy  adjustments  and  improve  the \noperations of RFIs. Institutionalizing policies that emphasize good \ngovernance will yield considerable benefits in terms of fostering a \nlong-term  sector-wide  perspective  for  sustainability.  Efficient \ndelivery of rural finance services will reduce transaction costs and \nhelp  ensure  viability  of  RFIs  as  well  as  that  of  rural  enterprises, \nthus  contributing  to  employment  generation,  income  expansion, \nand poverty reduction.  \n \nMajor  issues  in  the  rural  finance  sector  that  require  policy \ninterventions  are  covered  by  the  program  loan.  Support  for \ninstitutional strengthening and outreach are covered by the project \nloans.  The  program  loan  includes  five  components:  (i) conducive \npolicies, \nframework, \nlegal  and \n(iii) institutional  reforms  for  sustainability,  (iv) strengthening  the \ndemand  side,  and  (v) expansion  of  rural  finance  in  conflict-\naffected  areas.  The  reforms  introduce  fundamental  changes  in \nRFIs,  namely  cooperative \nregional \ndevelopment  banks  (RDBs),  the  National  Development  Trust \nFund  (NDTF),  and  Samurdhi  Banking  Societies  (SBS).  The  legal \nand regulatory framework introduces effective supervision of RFIs \nand  creates  legal  provision  for  enhancing  the  participation  of \nmicrofinance-nongovernment organizations (MF-NGOs) and other \nprivate  sector  initiatives  in  rural  finance.  In  addition,  the  reforms \nwill  redefine  the  Rural  Economy  Resuscitation  Fund  (RERF)  for \nextending  skills,  technical,  and  marketing  support  to  enable  the \nrural poor to efficiently utilize rural finance services.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $50,000,000  from  its  OCR,  with  a  15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffer rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  of  the  loan \namount,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the \nProgram Loan Agreement.  \n \nThe  program  loan  will  be  released  over  a  4-year  period  in  four \ntranches  to  meet  the  expected  occurrence  of  associated  costs. \nThe  first  tranche  of  $15,000,000  will  be  released  on  loan \neffectiveness,  the  second  tranche  of  $20,000,000 within  12 \nmonths of the first tranche, the third tranche of $10,000,000 within \n18  months  of  the  second  tranche,  and  the  fourth  tranche  of \n$5,000,000 within  18  months  of  the  third  tranche,  subject  to \ncompliance with release conditions.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation \n(MPDI) will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Ministry  of  Rural \nEconomy will be the implementing agency (IA) for RERF, RDBs, \n\n\fArrangements  \n\nProcurement  \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nThe Project Loans  \nObjective  \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n  v\n\nEconomy will be the implementing agency (IA) for RERF, RDBs, \nand  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Agency;  the  Ministry \nof Co-operatives for CRBs; the Ministry of Samurdhi for SBS; and \nNDTF for NDTF restructuring.  \n \nLoan proceeds will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange \ncost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding ineligible items.  \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  program  loan  will  be  used \nto meet the costs associated with the reform agenda.  \n \n \nThere are two project loans. The OCR project loan supports rural \nenterprise  development  through  a  credit  line.  The  project  loan \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  support  building  sector \ncapacity, developing financial infrastructure, RFI restructuring, and \nproject implementation.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $10,000,000  from  its  OCR,  with  a  25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-\nend  fee  of  0.5%  of  the  loan  amount;  and  such  other  terms and \nconditions as set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \nADB will provide a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights7,005,000 from its Special Funds resources, with a \n32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  with  an \ninterest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \nMPDI  will  oversee  and  coordinate  project  implementation.  The \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will be the IA for building sector \ncapacity. Other IAs, indicated for the program loan, will deal with \naspects relating to their respective institutions.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Expenditure  procedures  will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  A  total  of  58  person-months of \ninternational  and  628  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs  will  be  required  for  implementation. Where firms are to be \nengaged,  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be \nutilized  for  the  selection  of  consultants.  Where  possible  and \nappropriate, simplified technical procedures will be applied.  \n \n\n\fvi \n\nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries  \n\nSocial and  \nEnvironmental Issues \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nRFSDP  represents  a  shift  to  a  financial  system  development \napproach  where  sustainable  RFIs  will  meet  income  expansion, \nemployment generation, and poverty reduction objectives through \nenhanced outreach and product diversity resulting in more clients \nserved  and  their  diverse  needs  met  over  time.  Diminishing \ndependence of RFIs on subsidies will decrease politicization.  \n \nLegal  and  regulatory  framework  and  institutional  reforms  have \nbeen  anchored  on  good  governance,  transparency,  and  rigorous \nfinancial  discipline.  Cost-effective  supervision  ensures  the  safety \nof  the  savings  of millions  of  rural  households.  While  RFSDP  will \ndirectly  support  about  10,000  small  and  micro  rural  enterprises \nand  850  community  subprojects,  the  real  benefit  will  accrue  with \nthe  outreach  expansion  of  RFIs  using  their  own  resources, \nestimated at 200,000 new clients during RFSDP duration.  \n \nRural poverty would be reduced more rapidly by sustainable RFIs \nthan  welfare-oriented  arrangements  with  no  prospects \nfor \nsustainability.  The  strengthening  of  RFIs  will  ensure  that  the \npoverty  reduction  impact  is  felt  beyond  the  life  of  RFSDP.  RFIs \nhave  sound  prospects  to  expand  their  services  and  meet  the \ngrowing  demand  and  supply  gaps.  Appropriately  designed  and \npriced  services  that  take  into  consideration  the  asset  and \nconsumption  buildup  of  households  are  expected  to  enhance \nhousehold  income  above  the  poverty  threshold  after  four  or  five \nmicro loan cycles. For dealing with core poverty issues in conflict-\naffected  areas,  RFSDP  provides  a \nfor \nreactivating, strengthening, and establishing new RFIs.  \n \nlack  of  sustained  Government \nThe  major  risk  relates \ncommitment \nfinance  sector.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms \nrisk.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder \nmitigates \ncoordination, and capacity building are safeguards against the risk \nfor  delay  in  reforms.  Public  awareness  to  convey  the  benefit  of \nreforms  will  further  mitigate  this  risk.  Realization  of  RFSDP \nobjectives in the conflict-affected areas is related to improvement \nin operating conditions. In the meanwhile, RFSDP will facilitate the \nactivities of enterprising RFIs in the area and invest in institutional \nstrengthening for rapid expansion as the situation improves.  \n \nResistance  to  RFI  restructuring  has  been  mitigated  through \nupfront  agreement  with  respective  institutions  on  governance \nframework,  support \ninstitutional \nstrengthening. Safeguarding against delinquency risk is premised \non  tightening  credit  standards,  more  attention  to  credit  risk,  and \nrigorous  credit  appraisal. \nthe  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  not  to  interfere  in  lending  and  loan  collections  will \nimprove the repayment culture.  \n\nto \nto  a  market-driven  rural \n\nrecapitalization,  and \n\nflexible  approach \n\nIn  addition, \n\nthis \n\nfor \n\n\f  \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  three  proposed \nloans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Program (RFSDP).  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\nSri  Lanka\u2019s  human  development  index  rank  (89  out  of  173)1  and  per  capita  gross \n2.  \ndomestic product ($870)2 are by far the highest in South Asia. Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth rate \nof  nearly  5%  over  the  past  two  decades  is  above  the  world  average,  suggesting  resilience \ndespite the civil conflict. Nevertheless, growth has been unevenly distributed and has not been \nfast enough to reduce poverty incidence. Poverty continues to be widespread, with estimates of \n25% to 39%3 of the population in poverty, depending on the level of the underlying poverty line.4 \nThe sizable difference between the estimates indicates that while the former may be classified \nas chronically poor, the latter are vulnerable to chronic poverty or to periods of chronic poverty \ncaused by factors such as unemployment and poor harvests. Even those marginally above the \npoverty line are vulnerable, while the position in the conflict-affected areas5 of the north and the \neast  is  presumed  to  be  worse.6  Even  though  there  are  wide  regional  disparities  in  poverty \nincidence, poverty is overwhelmingly a rural issue.  \n \nAccordingly,  the  economic  reform  program7  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  aims  to \n3.  \nreduce  poverty  by  building  a  supportive  macroeconomic  environment  and  by  helping  to \nestablish  lasting  peace  by  relief,  rehabilitation,  and  reconstruction  to  reduce  conflict-related \npoverty. Creating opportunities for the poor to participate in economic growth, empowering the \npoor,  and  strengthening  governance  are  other  strategic  foundations  of  the  reforms.  Broad-\nbased  rural  development  is  the  key  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  including  employment  and \nincome generation, and access to financial and business services. \n \n4.  \nHigh  Poverty Concentration in the Rural Sector.  The rural sector consists of about \n15 million people, or nearly 80% of the total population of 18.7 million. Using the consumption-\nbased  upper  poverty  line,  88%  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas,  constituting  41%  of  the  rural \npopulation.  Income  inequality  between  rural  and  urban  areas  is  significant.  Rural  poverty  is \nmostly associated with underemployment, as income from both farm and nonfarm sectors, that \n\n                                                 \n1   United Nations Development Programme.

For  the  interim,  the  Government \nestimates  that  poverty  in  conflict-affected  areas  will  be  comparable  to  Uva  province,  the  poorest  province  in  the \ncountry. This represents 42% of the 1.9 million people estimated to be in the conflict-affected areas in 2001. Final \nresults of the most recent official poverty head count undertaken in 2002 will provide definitive data.  \n\n7   Regaining  Sri  Lanka,  released  in  December  2002,  outlines  the  vision  and  strategy  of  the  Government  for \naccelerated  development.  Regaining  Sri  Lanka  includes  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund approved 3-year arrangements (2003\u20132006) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility and Extended Fund Facility amounting to $567 million for Sri Lanka, on 18 April 2003.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nprovide  75%  of  the  rural  employment,  remains  below  consumption  poverty levels. Most of the \npoor are farmers cultivating low-value crops on small plots of land; workers in the fisheries and \nlivestock  sectors;  workers  and  the  self-employed  in  remote  areas  lacking  basic  amenities; \nlandless  workers  and  craftspeople  in  low-wage, irregular operations; and squatter settlers and \ndisplaced persons. Slow growth in agricultural productivity and value addition, lack of integration \nwith the mainstream economy, unclear land tenure, social exclusion, and limited access to basic \nsocial  services,  education,  and  infrastructure  are  some  of  the  causes  of  poverty,  along  with \ninadequate economic growth and income distribution.8 Only 40% of the rural areas have access \nto electricity, roads, and piped water. The Government owns roughly 80% of the land, two thirds \nof which is used by farmers under various tenure arrangements.  \n \nGender  and  Poverty.9  Despite  favorable  gender  indicators  compared  to  the  rest  of \n5.  \nSouth Asia, female-headed households and women in conflict-affected areas have emerged as \nthe  new  vulnerable  groups.  The  most  disadvantaged  are  the  women  who  live  in  isolated \ncommunities without access to roads, electricity, services, and markets. Female unemployment \nrates  are  at  least  double  those  of  men  and  the  majority  of  women  workers are trapped in low \nskill,  low-income  jobs,  and  with  poor  working  conditions.  Women  are  primarily  unpaid  family \nworkers  in  agriculture.  Self-employment  and  microcredit  without  access  to  skills,  technology, \nand markets have perpetuated their poverty.  \n \nStratified  Rural  Finance  Markets.  Rural  finance  (RF)  includes  savings,  credit, \n6.  \ninsurance,  and  payment  services.  RF  is  broadly  segregated  into  financial  services  provided  to \nrural  farm  and  nonfarm  households,  a  large  number  of  which  are  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds. Microfinance, as a subset of RF, targets the poor. Considering the demographics of \nSri  Lanka,  microfinance  is  primarily  rural.  On  an  aggregate  level,  rural  loans  for  nonpoor \nhouseholds  average  SLRs250,000  ($2,577).  Loans  below  SLRs100,000  ($1,030)  to  poor  and \nlow-income  households  are  generally  considered  as  micro  loans,  the  average  being \nSLRs19,500  ($200).  Based  on  the  consumption  yardstick10 of poverty, the RF market may be \nclassified into three broad categories.  \n\nLower  Rural  Poor  or  Lower  Segment.  About  25%  of  the  rural  population \ncomprising landless, subsistence farmers with an uneconomic holding size; poor \nfishing  communities;  coastal  fisheries  workers;  farm  and  nonfarm  laborers; \nplantation laborers; and those affected by conflict.  \n\nHigher  Rural  Poor  or  Middle  Segment.  About  25%  of  the  rural  population, \nmainly comprising petty traders and small and tenant farmers affected by limited \nmarketing  avenues,  inadequate  land  tenure  arrangements,  and  infrastructure \nconstraints including road, electricity, and irrigation.  \n\nUpper  Segment.  Includes  commercial  farming,  large  plantations,  medium-to-\nlarge rural enterprises, and agriculture produce wholesalers. \n\n \n7.  \nDiverse Demand Pattern. Corresponding to the stratified markets (para. 6), the demand \nfor rural credit is diverse both in terms of activities for which credit is sought as well as the type \n                                                 \n8   Regaining Sri Lanka, Annex 2, pp.123-129. \n9   ADB. 2003.

The middle segment \nincludes households marginally above the poverty line that are vulnerable to chronic or transient poverty.  Poverty \nReduction  in  Sri  Lanka:  Issues,  Findings,  and  Approaches  (ADB  2001),  p.4,  concludes  that  nearly  half  the \npopulation is vulnerable to the risk of consumption poverty. \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n \n\n\f3\n\nand  duration  of  credit.

The  middle  segment \nrequires  working  capital,  cash  credit,  loans  against  pledge  of  produce,  and  medium-  to  long-\nterm  loans  for  crop  cultivation,  rural  transport,  and  land  development.  The  lower  market \nsegment  requires  credit  for  consumption,  micro  enterprises,  crops,  livestock,  and  minor \nirrigation.  The  rural  poor  demand  relatively  larger  loans,  compared  to  the  average  micro  loan \nsize of SLRs19,500, to diversify or increase the scale and scope of their activities.  \n\nThe aggregate demand for rural credit is estimated at SLRs60 billion ($618 million). 11 Of \n8.  \nthis,  the  micro  loan  component  is  SLRs23 billion  ($237 million)  relating  to  2.3 million \nborrowers.12 In addition, the largely undocumented demand for rural credit by an estimated 20% \nfemale-headed households,13 women in conflict-affected areas, poor women including returning \nmigrant  workers,  and  plantation  workers  could  be  significant.  The  major  credit  demand \nemanates  from  small  rural  enterprises,14  agriculture  and  allied  sectors  including  agriculture \nproduction  and  marketing,  farm  mechanization,  land  development,  irrigation,  livestock,  and \nforestry. Sector distribution of rural credit demand15 indicates 50% for the small rural enterprise \nsector, 30% for agriculture and allied sectors, and 20% for the rest. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n9.  \nAs  in  the  case  of  credit,  the  demand  for  savings  is  diverse  with  the  lower  segment \nprimarily seeking rural finance institutions (RFIs) that provide security for their savings. Savings \npotential  is  immense,  given  the  domestic  savings  to  gross  domestic  product  ratio  of  16%.  In \naddition,  the  need  for  risk  mitigation  is  widely  felt.  With  Sri  Lanka  receiving  $1.1 billion  in \nremittances during 2001, there is a significant opportunity for RFIs to tap into this market.  \n\nHeterogeneous  and  Proliferating  Supply  Sources.  RF  in  Sri  Lanka,  while  largely \n10. \ngovernment-owned,  has  one  of  the  most  diversified  supply  sides  in  the  region.  A  range  of \nlegislation  governs  the  diverse  range  of  RFIs 16  established  for  meeting  the  rural development \nand poverty reduction priorities through credit expansion. The Government\u2019s dominance in RF is \nexercised through ownership and control over pricing of services. The supply sources comprise: \n \n\nFormal,  i.e.,  those supervised by the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)\u2014632 \nrural branches of commercial banks, 56 rural branches of National Savings Bank, \n6  regional  development  banks  (RDBs)  with  191  branches,  and  SANASA \nDevelopment Bank (SDB) with 8 branches.  \n\nSemiformal,17 those established or registered under secondary rules of various \nlegislation  but  not  supervised  by  CBSL:  National  Development  Trust  Fund \n(NDTF); 311 cooperative rural banks (CRBs) with 1,196 outlets; 8,500 thrift and \n\n                                                 \n11 Aggregate demand estimates exclude the conflict-affected areas and informal arrangements. \n12 ADB. 2002. Commercialization of Microfinance in Sri Lanka. Manila.  \n13  ADB.1999. County Briefing Paper. Women in Sri Lanka. Manila. \n14 Agriculture-related  enterprises  include  small-scale  processing  of  agriculture  produce  and  byproducts  into \nsemifinished  and  finished  goods,  and  production  and  supply  of  agricultural  inputs.  Nonfarm  enterprises  include \nbasic transport, handicraft, and weaving.  \n\n15  Published  aggregate  RF  statistics  are  unavailable.  This  classification  is  based  on  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka \n\nstatistics and the disbursement pattern of ADB-funded and other external agency-funded projects.  \n\n16  The  wide  range  of  RF  providers  have  been  given  a  broad  classification  for  clarity.  In  this  document,  unless \notherwise specified, RFIs collectively denote RDBs, SDB, and the entire range of semiformal RFIs including MF-\nNGOs.  The  term  \u201cRF\u201d  or  \u201cRFI\u201d  is  thus  inclusive  of  \u201cmicrofinance\u201d  or  \u201cmicrofinance  institution\u201d,  respectively.  The \nterm \u201cmicrofinance\u201d or \u201cmicrofinance institution\u201d is used only for specific microfinance-related reference. Likewise, \nwherever relevant, commercial banks are specifically mentioned.  \n\n17  In addition, there are other small-scale financing organizations such as the Tea Shakti Foundation and savings and \n\ncredit societies organized under farmer organizations. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\ncredit  cooperative  societies  (TCCSs);  970  Samurdhi  banking  societies  (SBSs); \napproximately  200  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations  (MF-NGOs); \nnumerous government rural credit programs; pawnshops; and 4,042 post offices \nthat collect savings, often in collaboration with National Savings Bank. \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nInformal  or  Noninstitutional, such as  rotating  savings  and  credit  associations, \ninput suppliers, traders, moneylenders, landlords, friends, and relatives. \n\n \nCommercial banks primarily serve the upper segment of the RF market and partially the \n11. \nmiddle  segment.  Commercial  bank  participation  in  the  middle  and  lower  segments  of  the  RF \nmarket are generally through government programs. Semiformal RFIs focus on the middle and \nlower  segments  and  the  MF-NGOs  target  the  most  vulnerable  sections  within  the  lower \nsegment.  While  the  most  numerous,  the  intermittent  nature  of  credit  from  informal  sources \nmainly  caters  to  immediate  consumption  and  contingencies.  Interest  charges  in  the  informal \nsources are too high to leave any households surplus. Poor women are confined to subsistence \nactivities  with  access  only  to  informal  sources  of  credit.  Their  weak  bargaining  power \nsignificantly raises the cost of credit to them. \n \n12. \nLinked  in  a  complex  of  relationships,  the  formal  and  semiformal  sources  meet  nearly \nthree fourths of the rural credit demand and provide saving facilities in most, if not all, parts of \nthe  country.  Total  rural  loans  outstanding  with  RFIs  and  commercial  banks  at  end-2001 were \nSLRs50 billion.  The  total  number  of  active  micro  loans,  including  those  with  MF-NGOs,  is \n1.65 million,  with  an  outstanding  amount  of  SLRs18.23 billion.  In  addition  to  micro  loans, \nworking capital, trade finance, investment credit, crop loans, and savings facilities are the most \ncommon services provided. Lending interest rates are in the range of 14\u201316% for state-owned \ncommercial  banks,  20\u201322%  for  private  commercial  banks,  and  18\u201328%  for  others.  Supply  of \nrisk  mitigation  and  remittance  services  is  affected  by  lack  of  explicit  legal  basis  for  extending \nsuch services by RFIs. (A sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 1.) \n \nB. \n \n13. \nA  vibrant  rural  economy  requires  robust  RF  markets  that  can  efficiently  allocate \nresources  and  facilitate  exchange  of  goods  and  services.  Efficient  RF  markets  contribute  to \npoverty reduction through enabling rural households to respond to economic and technological \nopportunities that generate employment in farm and rural enterprises and establish forward and \nbackward  linkages  in  the  rural  economy.  However,  politicization  has  weakened  both  the \ncommercial  banks  and  RFIs.  Bank  of  Ceylon  and  the  People\u2019s  Bank,  the  two  largest  state-\nowned commercial banks with half the banking sector assets and branches, have gone through \nsuccessive  institutional-strengthening  processes  for  restoring  capital  adequacy,  enhancing \nefficiency,  and  reducing  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  While  Bank  of  Ceylon  has  shown \nimprovements, the People\u2019s Bank has a capital adequacy of 11%. Its provision for loan losses \ncovers  only  60%  of  the  NPLs  and  the  repayment  rate  for  rural  credit  is  approximately  75%.18 \nBoth these banks are being restructured with World Bank and ADB19 assistance. Some private \ndomestic banks also reflect weak governance and financial status. \n \n14. \nRFIs  also  have  pervasive  weaknesses  and  suffer  from  weak  governance,  high \ntransaction  costs,  and  recurring  losses  that  add  to  the  fiscal  burden.  Very  few  RFIs  are \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n                                                 \n18  Repayment rate in this document refers to collection as a percentage of loans due. \n19 ADB. 2000.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on two Proposed Loans to the \n\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Private Sector Development Program. Manila  \n\n \n \n\n\f5\n\nfinancially self-sufficient and repayment rates go as low as 60%. RFIs are not even subject to \nbasic  prudential  standards,  and  regulatory  mechanisms  for  semiformal  RFIs  are  inadequate, \ndespite  their  mobilization  of billions  of  SLRs  as  savings  from  millions of small depositors. The \nlonger these problems remain neglected the more intractable they will become, as evident from \nthe decade-long reforms of the commercial banks. Immediate and concerted efforts are required \nto address systemic issues in the RF sector. \n\n \n1. \n\nPolicies and Sector Plan \n\n2. \n\n Supervisory and Regulatory Framework  \n\n \n15. \nIn the absence of a  dedicated policy, the RF sector is heavily fragmented with RFIs that \nreflect weak governance and grossly inadequate institutional capacity. In particular, a history of \nad hoc public sector interventions at the national and, increasingly, provincial levels has resulted \nin  an  uncontrolled  proliferation  of  fundamentally  weak  RFIs.  As  a  result,  tolerance  for  loan \ndefaults,  waivers,  and  postponements  has  gradually  increased.20  Consequently,  repayment \nrates  remain  low  and  sustainability  of  RFIs  has  suffered.  Populist  government  programs \npromote  financing  of  activities  that  generate  insufficient  as  well  as  temporary  economic  and \nsocial benefits. Major issues in RF, such as regulation for deposit protection, receive inadequate \nattention  and  there  is  no  institutionalized  mechanism  to  coordinate  RF  interventions  with  rural \nand  agriculture  sector  policies.  In  this  environment,  private  sector  investments  in  RF  have \nremained marginal. A policy framework is required for redefining the Government\u2019s role in RF to \nfacilitate  the  functioning  of  RF  markets  and  to  create  the  right  incentives  for  greater  private \nsector participation in RF.  \n \n \n \nThe  absence  of  a  policy  and  supervisory  framework  has  allowed  the  proliferation  of \n16. \nfundamentally  unsustainable  RFIs  under  various \nlaws,  which  (i) enables  government \ninterventions in product and pricing decisions, weakens governance, and diminishes institutional \nautonomy;  (ii) exacerbates  the  lack  of  enforcement  of  financial  prudence;  (iii) strengthens the \ntendency  to  operate  on  regulatory  arbitrage;  (iv) does  not  provide  for  transformation  of  MF-\nNGOs  into  depository  institutions  or  regularize  their  savings  activities;  and  (v) inhibits \ndiversification of services that require a distinct legal mandate, such as remittances. \n \n17. \ninformation \ntechnology  (IT)  platforms  are  rudimentary.  As  a  result,  institutional  information  is  both \ninadequate and unreliable. Most semiformal RFIs are inadequately supervised, if at all, putting \nthe savings of millions of rural households at risk. The proliferation of semiformal RFIs makes it \ndifficult  to  institute  an  effective  supervisory  mechanism.  Considering  the  banking  sector \nweaknesses (para. 13), CBSL is rightly focusing on banks, which hold the bulk of banking sector \nassets.  In  addition,  CBSL  supervision  for  semiformal  RFIs  is  not  a  cost-effective  option.  An \neffective  response  is  to  stem  the  proliferation  of  RFIs  through  a  stricter  entry  threshold  and \noperating standards, preferably through a cost-effective second-tier agency.  \n \n \n \n18. \n  While  RFIs  have  proliferated,  there  is  a  lack  of  affordable  high-quality  training  for \nmainstreaming  RF  best  practices.  CBSL\u2019s  Center  for  Banking  Studies  (CBS)  and  International \n\nTraining Arrangements for Rural Finance \n\nAccounting  standards,  management \n\ninformation  system  (MIS),  and \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n20  Sustainability  refers  to  the  ability  to  provide  high-quality  financial  services  to  existing  and  potential  clients  on  a \npermanent  basis  without  the  need  for  government  or  donor  support.  This  also  implies  a  for-profit orientation in \nadministration and operations to attract equity investments and mobilize savings and commercial borrowings.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nInstitutional Sustainability  \n\nCentre  for  Training  of  Rural  Leaders  offer  limited  training  on  RF.  Sarvaodaya  Economic \nEnterprise  Development  Services  Management  Training  Institute  and  SANASA  Training \nInstitute  are  dedicated  facilities.  The  Rural  Development  Training  Institute  provides  some \ntraining  on  delivery  of  RF  and  social  services.  Universities  do  not  offer  courses  specifically  on \nRF or microfinance. None of these institutions currently offers a comprehensive curriculum that \nis consistent with RF best practices, which is a requirement of the majority of RFIs and even of \ncommercial  banks.  Further,  semiformal  RFIs  are  unaware  of  their  need  for  such  training. \nAddressing the training needs of the RF sector, including those of policy makers and regulators, \nwill have to be prioritized for effective institutional reform.  \n \n \n \nIrrespective  of  the  type  of  RFI,  the  financial  and  operational  results  of  the  majority  of \n19. \nRFIs  fail  to  conform  to  internationally  accepted  standards  for  sustainability  and  the  financial \nviability  of  RFIs  in  general  is  deteriorating.  Supporting  unviable  entities  is  an  increasing  but \navoidable strain on government resources. Outreach of RFIs has come at the cost of portfolio \nquality and continuity of RF services is not yet assured for many rural households.  \n \n20. \nRegional Development Banks. Established under the Regional Development Bank Act \nof 1985, RDBs are owned by the Government, CBSL, commercial banks, and CBSL Employee \nProvident Fund. The RDBs primarily focus on the middle and lower segments of the RF markets \nwith  nearly  80%  of  their  loans  below  SLRs100,000  (Appendix 2).  Aggregate  deposits  and \noutstanding  loans  at  end-2001  were  SLRs4.7 billion  and  SLRs5.5 billion,  respectively.  By \nvolume, the RDBs provide approximately 18% of all micro loans. The orientation of RDB staff is \ninappropriate for banking with the poor. Overall portfolio quality remains weak. NPLs among the \nsix  RDBs  range  from  16%  to  33%.  Continued  weaknesses  in  RDBs  could  affect  the  safety  of \ndeposits, and consequently diminish RDBs\u2019 image and business prospects. Nevertheless, RDBs \nrepresent a significant formal financial sector presence in rural areas and there is considerable \npotential for them to enhance their role in the RF sector. A holistic restructuring is required  for \nimproving governance, credit policies and products, and human resource management. \n \n21. \nCooperative  Rural  Banks.  CRBs  are  member-based  institutions  (Appendix 3). Of the \n311 CRBs, 306 are departments of multipurpose cooperative societies and five CRBs are stand-\nalone  institutions.  There  are  1,196  CRB  outlets.  In  addition,  14  apex  district  CRB  unions  pool \nCRB  surpluses  for  investments.  CRBs  collectively  mobilized  SLRs16.6 billion  at  end-2001  in \n5.8 million  savings  accounts.  Their  loans  outstanding  at  end-2001  were  SLRs5.9 billion  at  an \naverage loan size of SLRs8,500. CRBs provide nearly one third of the total micro loans. While \nmultipurpose cooperative societies come under the purview of the Cooperative Societies Act of \n1972,  the  CRBs,  as  departments  in  these  societies,  are  neither  subject  to  any  effective \nindependent  supervision  nor  do  they  file  separate  accounts.  Governance  is  a  key  issue,  as \nCRBs suffer from political capture by local interests.  While between half and two thirds of the \nCRBs  are  reportedly  viable,  their  performance  varies.21  The  aggregate  repayment  rate  is  only \n65%.  The  performance  of  the  stand-alone  CRBs  is  somewhat  better.  Because  of  the \nwidespread nature of problems, any failure of CRBs will put the savings, of which two thirds are \nfrom nonmembers, at risk. About SLRs7 billion ($72 million) of CRB resources are considered at  \nrisk due to bad investments and poor portfolio quality. \n \n22. \nThe 8,500 registered TCCSs, with an estimated membership of 905,106, are federated \ninto  a  nationwide  network  involving  33  district  unions  and  a  national  federation  of  TCCSs \n                                                 \n21 In the absence of independent accounts, it is difficult to precisely indicate the financial status.  \n\n \n \n\n\f7\n\n(Appendix 3). In total, 252,682 loans amounting to SLRs2.8 billion were outstanding as of end-\n2000.  Women  accounted  for  55%  of  clients,  with  an  average  loan  size  of  SLRs12,000. The \nTCCS federation has no central management and does not act as a regulator or supervisor, or \neven  as  an  effective  coordinator.  The  TCCSs  suffer  from  weak  accounting  and  MIS,  and  their \nsystems and procedures are often incompatible across the primary, district, and national levels. \nThe majority of TCCSs are considered to be dormant.  \n \n23. \nCommercial Banks. Beyond government programs, commercial banks also provide RF \nservices in the normal course of business. In terms of volume, commercial banks constitute two \nthirds  of  aggregate  rural  credit  and  are  the  main  providers  of  term  credit  for  rural  enterprises. \nWhile private commercial banks aggressively look for profitable RF business niches, they tend \nto concentrate on large loans. The state-owned commercial banks, on the other hand, will have \nto, on a priority basis, rationalize their RF operations to alter their target-driven approach, and \nshed accumulated overheads and inefficiencies. Expansion of RF operations is in the long-term \ninterest of commercial banks, as urban banking centers are becoming overcrowded. \n \nThe  restructuring  of  the  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  greater  participation  of \n24. \nprivate  commercial  banks  in  rural  areas  are  essential  to  enhance  the  supply  of  rural  credit  for \nrapid  income  expansion  through  rural  enterprise  financing.  Systemic  linkages  with  MF-NGOs \ncould cost-effectively drive commercial bank expansion in microfinance. Currently, microfinance \nexposure  of  commercial  banks  is  limited  to  government  programs.  Com mercial  bank \nparticipation in government sponsored subsidized credit programs crowds out the private sector \nbanks.  Despite  this,  some  private  commercial  banks,  especially  Hatton  National  Bank,  Seylan \nBank,  and  Sampath  Bank  have  made  genuine  attempts  through  innovative  pilot  schemes  to \nenlarge  their  microfinance  portfolio.  People\u2019s  Bank  is  also  implementing  a  rural  innovation \nproject  funded  by  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ);  this  project \nneeds  to  be  mainstreamed  and  replicated  by  other  commercial  banks.  Improvements  in  staff \norientation, as well as skills for credit appraisal, delivery, and monitoring will serve to enlarge the \nscope of commercial bank participation in RF on a commercial basis.  \n \n25. \nApex Agencies.  In  addition  to  savings  and  participation  in  government  and  external \nagency-funded  programs,  RFIs  access  refinance  assistance  for  onlending.  NDTF  was \nestablished  in  1992  under  the  Poverty  Alleviation  Program 22  as  an  apex  agency  for  providing \ntechnical  and  refinance  assistance  for  microfinance  (Appendix 4).  Most  of  NDTF\u2019s  operations \nwere  wound  up  in  1998,  though  it  continued  its  microfinance  refinancing  activities.  It  is  the \nprimary \nits  resources \nlending \n(SLRs1.07 billion)  and  potential  demand.  At  end-June  2002,  NDTF  had  160  partner  RFIs,  of \nwhich  81  were  actively  borrowing,  and  an  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  SLRs597.1 million \n($6.2 million). NDTF\u2019s on-time loan repayment rate is about 88%. NDTF performance has been \nlow  due  to  (i)  weaknesses  in  selection  of  target  institutions,  credit  assessment,  and  portfolio \nmanagement;  (ii) difficulties  in  promoting  viable  micro  enterprises  in  an  environment  of  low \neconomic  growth,  segmented  markets,  and  serious  infrastructure  bottlenecks;  (iii) institutional \ninadequacies  of  client  RFIs  and  commercial  banks;  and  (iv) weak  capacity  for  RF  institution \nbuilding. Fundamental reforms are required to enhance NDTF\u2019s capacity, including changes in \nits incorporation, governance, client selection, and pricing practices. Only after this will NDTF be \nable to act as a focal point for development of the MF-NGOs.  \n \n26. \nAs  a  specialized  bank  owned  by  the  TCCSs,  SDB  (Appendix 3)  mobilizes  deposits \nthrough 10 branches for lending primarily through selected TCCSs (para. 22). As a result, SDB \n                                                 \n22 Funded by World Bank ($20 million), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau ($10 million), and the Government ($5 million). \n\nis  small  compared  with \n\nto  MF-NGOs,  but \n\nlender \n\nits \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nis  filling  the  gap  created  by  the  weak  TCCS  federation.  As  of  end-June 2001, SDB had 6,270 \nmicro loans with a value of SLRs127.5 million ($1.3 million). SDB potential is largely dependent \non  the  absorptive  capacity  of  TCCSs,  which  is  rapidly  decreasing.  SDB  has  to  simultaneously \ngear for enhancing direct lending activities and concentrate only on viable TCCSs. At present, \nSDB\u2019s institutional capacities are similar to RDBs\u2019.  \n\n \n5. \n\nGovernment Interventions  \n\n \nGovernment  interventions  include  micro  loans  through  commercial  banks  and  several \n27. \ngovernment-sponsored, often external agency-funded, rural credit programs especially for rural \npoor.  CBSL  and  Samurdhi  Authority  are  the  executing  agencies  of  nearly  30 such programs. \nCBSL  supervises  some  external  agency-funded  and  government  rural  credit  programs  that \ninclude interest subsidy schemes. While a developmental role of CBSL is justified to a degree, \nthe  nature  of  its  current  involvement  perpetuate  outmoded  RF  paradigm  inconsistent  with \nsustainable RF and is also a conflict of interest with its supervisory function. While government \nprograms have averted severe poverty, political interference and weak design have encouraged \ndependence on below-cost credit and induced poor repayment behavior.23  \n\n28. \nThe Samurdhi Program governed by the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka Act No. 30 of \n1995 is the main poverty reduction program, and has two main components (Appendix 5). The \nfirst  set  comprises  welfare  programs  and  subsidized  lending  programs  through  state-owned \ncommercial  banks.  The  second,  SBS  program  that  began  in  1997,  has  970  SBSs.  With \n1.7 million  families  as  members,  the  SBS  program  reaches  about  50%  of  all  households. \nWomen  hold  two  thirds  of  the  share  in  SBSs.  Member  and  nonmember  capital  and  savings \namount  to  SLRs6.7  billion,  and  the  total  outstanding  loans  at  end-  2001  were  SLRs2.3 billion \nwith 429,231 active loans. A credit guarantee scheme and two insurance schemes complement \nSBS.  However,  weak  management  and  lack  of  effective  supervision  have  weakened  the \nsystem.  Despite  a  repayment  rate  of  93.4%  and  a  3%  per  month  interest  rate  on  loans,  three \nfourths of SBSs are nonviable due to administrative overheads that require recurring budgetary \nsupport. Governance and transparency are major and immediate concerns.  \n  \n\n6. \n\nLegal  Status  and  Institutional  Capacity  of  Microfinance-Nongovernment \nOrganizations \n\n \n29. \nThe  poorest  groups  are  reached  only  by  way  of  group-guaranteed  loans,  which  are \nmainly  provided  by  MF-NGOs  (Appendix 6).  A  high  proportion  of  microfinance  in  conflict-\naffected  areas  is  provided  by  MF-NGOs. However, the  majority  of  MF-NGOs, which number \naround 200, are operationally and financially weak. Fewer than five have profitable operations.24 \nThe  largest  MF-NGO,  Sarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Services,  commonly \nknown as SEEDS, provides loans in the range $100\u2013550, and at end-March 2001 had 177,974 \nactive  loan  clients  with  an  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  SLRs667 million. Janashakthi  has 67 \nsocieties  comprising  28,168  women  in  464  village  societies  that  pool  individual  and  group \nsavings  to  extend  small  loans.  Savings  and  loans  outstanding  amount  to  SLRs29 million and \nSLRs91 million, respectively. The Social Mobilization Fund, Arthachariya Foundation, and Agro \nmart are middle-sized MF-NGOs with 3,000\u201310,000 clients. The rest are small MF-NGOs with \nportfolio in the range of $10,000\u201340,000.  MF-NGOs require substantial improvements in credit \nappraisal, supervision and monitoring, and loan-delinquency management.  \n                                                 \n23  S.

Most  of  the  small  MF-NGOs  are  focused  on  broader  social  objectives,  and  give \ninadequate  priority  to  improving  their  financial  intermediation  skills,  especially  in  the  areas  of \nfinancial  analysis,  strategic  planning,  and governance. Substantial support under government \nand  external  agency-funded  programs  perpetuate  this  orientation  leading  to  a  widespread \nculture of dependence, a high-cost structure, and abrupt discontinuation after program closure. \nDespite  not  being  legally  permitted,25  most  MF-NGOs  mobilize  savings  and  would  collapse  if \nthey did not do this. Therefore, there is a need to create an appropriate legal structure (para. 17) \nwith  adaptations  to  recognize  and  accommodate  their  distinctive  operations.  The  MF-NGOs \nshould be allowed opportunities for accessing loan funds and institutional strengthening support, \nprovided that they demonstrate significant interest in sustainable microfinance.  \n \n \n \n31.  While  there  is  a wide RFI network, the estimated gap between demand and supply for \nrural  credit  is  around  SLRs10 billion  ($103 million)  at  the  current  lending  interest  rates \n(para. 12). The credit supply could be higher by an estimated SLRs3 billion ($31 million), if the \nconstraints imposed by limited access to medium- to long-term credit were removed. Within the \noverall gap, an estimated SLRs4.7 billion in 0.65 million accounts is for micro loans for the rural \npoor, at an average of SLRs20,000. However, this segment is restricted to borrowing amounts \nlower  than  that  required  for  generating  household  surpluses  to  cross  the  subsistence  and \npoverty thresholds. It is also difficult for this segment to obtain larger and longer-term loans in \nthe range of SLRs50,000\u2013100,000 for investing in fixed assets for expansion and diversification \nof  their  sources  of  income.  Supply  gaps  are  also  marked  for  (i) loans  of  approximately \nSLRs200,000\u20131 million,  but  particularly  in  the  range  of  SLRs250,000\u2013300,000, the \u201cmissing \nmiddle\u201d,26  that  is  neither  a  microfinance  clientele  nor  adequately  served  by  the  commercial \nbanks,  and  (ii) term  loans  of  2\u20135  years.  The  demand  could  be  still  higher  with  lower  interest \nrates, which could be possible with decreased government presence in the debt market.  \n \n\n8. \n\nRural Finance in Conflict-Affected Areas  \n\n \n32. \nAccess  to  RF  services  is  inadequate  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  To  a  great  extent, \nformal sources of RF dried up during the conflict. The advent of the peace process provides an \nopportunity  for  customized  response  that  incorporates  best  practices,  innovations  in  RF \ndelivery,  and  local  adaptations  to  cater  to  the  unique  social  and  cultural  conditions.  The \nchallenge  is  to  support  both  the  establishment  of  an  institutional  structure  that  will  be  able  to \nprovide  quality  financial  services  on  a  permanent  basis  as  well  as  meeting  the  immediate \nfinancing  needs  of  rural  households.  While  the  financing  of  household  income-generating \nactivities is important, it is equally important to support rural entrepreneurs who could generate \nlocal employment. Considering that institutions and infrastructure have been destroyed or badly \nneglected  due  to  two  decades  of  conflict,  the  need  for  simultaneous  investments  in  the  real \nsector  and  for  capacity  building  of  communities  is  critical  for  a  sustainable  RF  sector. \nSequencing the delivery of RF services with the ongoing and planned reconstruction efforts is \nimportant for maximizing the development impact.  \n\n                                                 \n25  Under  the  Banking  Act  No.  30  of  1988  and  the  Finance  Companies  Act  no.  78  of  1988,  an  institution  must  be \n\nlicensed as a bank or a finance company to collect deposits from either members or nonmembers. \n\n26 ADB. 2000.  Rural  Financial  Markets  in  Asia:  Policies,  Paradigms  and  Performance.  Manila.  This  is  volume  3  of \nStudy of Rural Asia, ADB, 2000, published by Oxford University Press. The \u201cmissing middle\u201d in the context of Sri \nLanka broadly relates to activities such as repair shops, foundries, rural transport,  trade, manufacture of small farm \nequipment, supply of high-yielding seeds and fertilizers, and irrigation facilities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\n \n\n9. \n\nDemand-Side Development \n \n\n \n33. \nProduction  and  marketing  bottlenecks  due  to  weak  rural  infrastructure  accentuate  the \nrisks in RF and reduce the profitability of the rural enterprises as well as RFIs. Low prices and \npoor  productivity  make  it  difficult  for  the  rural  sector  to  compete  for  investment  capital  against \nurban  and  industrial  projects.  In  addition,  the  absence  of  forward  and  backward  linkages  to \nsupport  value  addition  to  rural  produce  impedes  diversification  of  income  sources.  Low  skill \nlevels among clients in the lower segment of the RF market and the absence of risk mitigation \nmechanisms  not  only  create  risk  aversion  but  also  impair  the  ability  of  the  rural  poor  to \neffectively  utilize  the  availability  of  RF,  equitably  participate  in  the  local  economy,  and  reduce \nvulnerability  to  economic  downturns  and  natural  calamities.  The  impact  of  these  has  kept  a \nlarge part of the rural economy at subsistence levels, resulting in a high poverty incidence. \n \n34. \nAddressing  these  demand-side  issues  is  costly,  and  its  \u201cpublic  good\u201d  nature  makes  it \ndifficult to attract private sector investments. The microfinance-plus27 approach adopted by MF-\nNGOs and RFIs for addressing demand-side issues by factoring associated costs in the lending \ninterest  rate  has  the  unintended  impact  of  leaving  little,  if  any,  household  surplus  for the rural \npoor.  The  microfinance-plus  approach  through  limited  external  agency-funding has also led to \nambiguous social and financial intermediation goals, with little sustainable impact. Recognizing \nthese,  the  Government  recently  set  up  a  Rural  Economy  Resuscitation  Fund  (RERF)  in  the \nMinistry of Rural Economy (MRE) for supporting demand-side development with investments in \nsmall community-based infrastructure, skills, and marketing. Fiscal squeeze has, however, not \nallowed allocation of adequate resources, which impairs the potential benefits to the RF sector.  \n \nLessons Learned. The weak sector performance confirms the lessons learned that (i) a \n35. \nsupportive  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  is  required  for  an  orderly  and  systematic \nsector  development;  (ii) below-cost  lending  interest  rates  result  in  misallocation  of  resources \nand production inefficiencies; (iii) prolonged subsidy dependence undermines sustainability and \nintegration with financial markets; and (iv) inadequate rural infrastructure and a low skills base \ndepress  rural  incomes,  which  in  turn  adversely  affect  RF  markets.  Like  other  countries  in  the \nregion, credit expansion is not accompanied by quality services, and inadequate availability of \nmedium-  to  long-term  rural  credit  persists.  Where  state-owned  RFIs  have  failed,  the  private \nsector has not stepped in to fill the institutional and resource gaps.  \n \n36. \nClient perspectives in Sri Lanka suggest that (i) the lending interest rate is secondary to \navailability  and  accessibility;28  (ii) the  amount  and  term  of  credit  available  can  only  sustain \npresent  income  levels,  not  enable  the  rural  poor  to  cross  successive  income  thresholds;  and \n(iii) physical  collateral  requirements  impede  the  ability  to  upscale  rural  enterprises.  There is a \ngrowing consensus that rural poverty could be reduced rapidly by replacing welfare-orientation \nwith market-based systems. The Government is also committed to the ongoing economic reform \nprogram that emphasizes private sector-led growth and structural reforms in the financial sector. \nRF reforms will be better accomplished as part of a broader economic reform agenda.  \n\n                                                 \n27 Core financial intermediation functions relate to delivery of RF services. Rural including micro loans are delivered \neither through individuals or groups, the latter being formed with the intention to reduce delivery cost and build peer \npressure. The microfinance-plus approach, on the other hand, covers skills and literacy training, enterprise training, \nleadership and empowerment training, provision of community infrastructure, procurement and marketing support, \nand risk mitigation. Extremely important and relevant as these are for social capital formation, they remain much \nbeyond the capacity of MF-NGOs or RFIs to deliver and administer in a meaningful, sustainable, and cost-effective \nmanner. In the process, neither social nor financial objectives are sustainably realized. \n\n28  For those used to below cost credit, the obvious expectation is a continuation of the current situation. \n\n \n \n\n\f11\n\nOverall Rationale. The rural sector supports the bulk of the population\u2014the majority of \n37. \nthe  poor\u2014and  thus  is  the  largest  market  for  financial  services  in  terms  of  number  of  clients. \nImpressive  as  the  RF  outreach  is,  it  contrasts  sharply  with  the  deteriorating  operational  and \nfinancial  status  of  RFIs.  The  demand  and  supply  gap,  still  greater  potential  demand,  and \nregional  disparities  in  RF  service  delivery  are  largely  unattended.  Instead  of  mainstreaming \ngovernance  and  sustainability  as  core  values,  successive  governments  have  adopted  ad  hoc \nmeasures that exacerbated the weaknesses. The contribution of RF in diversification into new \nfarm and nonfarm opportunities and value addition in the rural sector remains unfulfilled. As a \nresult, the rural sector is trapped in low-risk and low-return investments. This will widen income \ngaps  both  within  rural  areas  and  relative  to  urban  areas,  and  will  have  long-term  negative \neffects on consumption and asset buildup, especially among rural poor households.  \n \n38.   A  sustainable  RF  system  is  a  critical  element  of  successful  rural  economies.  The \ncreation  of  an  effective  and  efficient  RF  system  is  conditional  on  the  removal  of  systemic \nconstraints  and  promotion  of  market-driven  responses  for  providing  appropriate  products  and \nservices.  This  will  only  be  possible  if  pursued  with  sustained  commitment  to  establishing  a \nfacilitating policy, legal, and institutional framework. The financial drain in supporting weak RFIs \nand likely contingent liabilities has prompted the Government to seek viable RFIs. The ongoing \nreforms  supported  by  the  World  Bank  and  ADB,  which  are  aimed  at  restructuring  commercial \nbanks and introducing stricter prudential norms, provide a positive context for reforms in the RF \nsector. Success will still, though, depend on  improvements in the macroeconomic climate and \nsimultaneously addressing  real sector issues.  Access  to  RF  at lower transaction cost is also \nimportant \nin  an \nenvironment in which World Trade Organization regulations are applied. \n \n\nleveraging  employment  and  enterprise  opportunities \n\nfor  successfully \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n39. \nThe Government\u2019s aim is to reduce poverty incidence to from 25% to 20% and attain an \neconomic  growth  rate  of  nearly  7%  by  2005.  The  Government\u2019s  economic  reform  program \nhighlights  the  role  of  RF  in  empowering  the  poor,  especially  women,  and  emphasizes \nsustainability  of  RFIs,  their  integration  with  the  financial  sector,  and  the  development  of  an \nintegrated  policy  and  legal  framework  for  MF-NGOs.  The  poverty  partnership  agreement \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  emphasizes  on  employment  generation,  pro-poor asset \ncreation, promotion of RF intermediation, and a larger role of the private sector for sustainable \ngrowth.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  underlines  the  need  for  a  suitable  regulatory \nframework for RFIs and greater access to RF through RFIs, including MF-NGOs.  \n \n40. \nA  systemic  response  to  address  the  issues  in  RF  is  essential  for  reviving  the  rural \neconomy through investments in agriculture and rural enterprises for promoting private sector-\nled  economic  growth  to  generate  employment  opportunities  and  reduce  poverty.  The \nGovernment  is  committed  to  introducing  progressive  policies  for  the  development  of  the  RF \nsector  and  protecting  it  from  being  used  for  short-term political gains. To accomplish this, an \nintegrated  package  of  policy,  institutional  development,  and  outreach  expansion  is  needed \nalong  with  strong  commitment  to  pursue  reforms.  The  sector  development  program  modality \nhas  thus  been  chosen  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  sector  reforms  to  ensure  that  an  adequate \npolicy and legal framework is in place to optimize investments in institutional strengthening and \noutreach.  RFSDP  formulation  was  closely  coordinated  with  various  stakeholders,  including \nCBSL, and representatives of the private sector, NGOs, and development partners. RFSDP is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s projects for strengthening nonbank financial services, small and medium \nenterprises, and the private sector. RFSDP develops synergies with ongoing ADB-funded social \nand  agriculture  sector  interventions  (Appendix 7).  The  agreements  on  RFSDP  are  reflected in \n\n \n\n\f12 \n \n\n \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix 8).  The  program \nframework is in Appendix 9 and a RF sector roadmap is in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n41. \nRFSDP is designed to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.  The goal is \nto enhance outreach of sustainable RF services. The objective is to establish a sustainable RF \nsystem through policy adjustments to eliminate structural constraints to growth of the RF sector \nand  to  improve  the  operations  of  RFIs.  Institutionalizing  policies  that  emphasize  good \ngovernance  will  yield  considerable  benefits  in  terms  of  fostering  a  long-term  sector-wide \nperspective for sustainability. The investments in RF will be able to generate adequate returns \nin terms of rural growth and value addition. Further, efficient delivery of RF services adapted  to \nthe nature of demand will ensure the viability of RFIs as well as of the rural enterprises that they \nserve. A positive RF environment will encourage private  sector involvement in RF, which could \nsupplement and facilitate RF outreach in conflict-affected areas.  \n \nRFSDP  consists  of  a  program  loan  and  two  project  loans.  The  policy  reforms  will \n42. \nestablish  an  institutional  framework  for  RF,  with  good  governance  and  sustainability  as  core \nvalues.  The  project  loans  will  assist  in  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  enhancing \noutreach.  The  scope  of  the  RF  reforms  will  include  policy,  governance,  institutions,  and \noutreach.  The  range  of  interventions  required  in  the  RF  sector  is  much  beyond  what  could \nreasonably  be  covered  within  the  span  of  RFSDP.  Therefore,  the  scope  of  interventions  has \nbeen  determined  based  on  RFI  commitment  to  reforms,  cost-effectiveness,  significance  of \ncontribution to RF sector development, and replicability.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Program Loan  \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n43.  Major policy issues in the RF sector are covered by the program loan. The program loan \ngoals are to ensure enhanced access by the rural households to RF services; good governance \nof RFIs; reduction in the role of the public sector; and increase in the role of the private sector, \nincluding  MF-NGOs,  in  RF.  The  specific  objective  is  to  develop  a  sustainable  RF  system  for \nproviding efficient services, primarily to the middle and lower segments of the RF markets, for \nsignificant income expansion and poverty reduction impact.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n2. \n \n44. \nThe  program  loan  has  five  components:  (i) conducive  policies,  (ii) supportive legal and \nregulatory  framework,  (iii) institutional  reforms  for  sustainability,  (iv) strengthening the demand \nside, and (v) expansion of RF in conflict-affected areas.  \n\n \na. \n\nConducive Policies  \n\n \n45. \n(Appendix 8) includes the following: \n\nParallel  to  ongoing  commercial  bank  reforms,  the  policy  for  the  promotion  of  RF \n\nestablishing a high-level body for coordinating RF sector policies;  \n \nimproving RF sector supervision and regulation;  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n \n \n\n\f13\n\n(iii) \n\nexpediting the recovery of dues;  \n\n(iv) \n\nphasing out CBSL\u2019s role in RF that raises conflict of interest; \n\ninstituting fundamental RFI reforms in CRBs, RDBs, NDTF, and SBSs; \n\ncurtailing government actions to pardon and discourage debt recovery; \n\nensuring that RFIs have autonomy to price their services; \n \nenhancing investments for demand-side development; and \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n \n(vi) \n \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(ix) \n\npromoting linkages between RFIs, NGOs, and community-based organizations. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSupportive Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\n \nAs  part  of  RFSDP,  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development Act (the RFSD Act) will be \n46. \npassed  to  consolidate  the  fragmented,  ineffective,  and  dormant  supervisory  and  regulatory \nmechanisms (paras. 16 and 17). The RFSD Act will be applicable to those RFIs, including MF-\nNGOs, which are not covered by the Banking Act of 1988 and are not under CBSL purview. The \nRFSD Act will: (i) provide for the establishment of a Rural Finance Sector Development Agency \n(RFSDA) for the supervision and regulation of RFIs not supervised by CBSL; (ii) prescribe the \nfunctions  of  and  prohibitions  on  the  various  categories  of  RFIs;  (iii) lay  down  licensing \nprocedures  and  requirements;  (iv) set  out  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  standards  and \nsystems;  (v) list  the  prudential  requirements,  including  disclosure  and  reporting  requirements; \nand (vi) outline the process of establishing and winding up RFIs.  \n \n47. \nRFSDA will also serve as the nodal  RF policy body for taking a holistic approach to RF \nsector issues, periodically reviewing sector developments, coordinating and guiding appropriate \ngovernment  interventions  in  RF,  and  maintaining  a  national  database  on  RF.  The  RFSD Act \nprogressively allows eligible RFIs, based on their institutional and financial capacity, to provide a \nwide  range  of  services,  including  risk  mitigation,  remittances,  and  pledges.  The  RFSD  Act \nmakes  RFIs  liable  for  the  security  of  deposits.  Summary  features,  text  of  the  RFSD  Act,  and \nimplementation  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix 2)  were  developed  with  extensive  consultation \nwith stakeholders, including the Government, CBSL, RFIs, and MF-NGOs.  \n \nThe RFSD Act allows RFSDA to have only 10 staff. On-site and off-site supervision will \n48. \nbe undertaken primarily through approved private sector auditors and audit firms29 engaged at a \nfee  to  be  paid  by  RFIs  in  a  phased  manner.  This  will  eliminate  the  need  for  a  large  staff \ncomplement and ensure appropriate  cost-effective supervision that allows operating flexibility to \nRFIs.  Considering  the  disarray  of  the  RF  sector,  due  diligence  of  RFIs  will  precede  the \napplication  of  RFSDA  provisions.  Adequate  transition  time  will  be  given  to  RFIs  for  full \ncompliance. Considering the large number of eligible RFIs, RFSDA will initially set a threshold in \nterms  of  savings  and  loan  size  to  limit  its  coverage  to  larger  RFIs.  Supervisory  reach  will \ngradually  grow.  While  RFSDA  will  initially  focus  on  CRBs,  the  immediate  benefit  will  be  the \nopportunity  for  eligible  MF-NGOs  to  operate  within  a  framework  that  recognizes  the  distinct \nnature of their operations, particularly savings mobilization and noncollateralized assets.  \n\n                                                 \n29 Those qualified and registered as auditors, including those registered with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. \n\nRFI appraisal skills of auditors will be developed using the Project Loan proceeds (para. 79).  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n \n\n \n\n49.  Mechanisms for recovery of defaults will be strengthened through an in-depth review of \nthe  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  recovery  of  debts  from  RFI  defaulters  and  developing \nand implementing an action plan to facilitate expeditious recovery of debts from such defaulters, \nconsistent  with  the  principles  of  due  process. This will encourage RFIs to expand their credit \nportfolio, thereby benefiting the rural economy. \n \n\nc. \n\nInstitutional Reforms for Sustainability  \n\n \nRFSDP  will  support  reforms  for  CRB,  RDBs,  NDTF,  and  SBSs,  whose  combined \n50. \noutreach for micro loans is nearly 65% of the market. In view of the challenging responsibility, \ninstitutional  reforms  have  been  phased,  among  others,  to  correspond  to  RFSDP-supported \ncapacity  for  managing  the  change  process.  To  ensure  effective  utilization  of  resources, the \noverriding  principles  for  RFSDP  assistance  for  institutional  reforms  are:  (i) demonstrated \ncommitment  of  RFIs  to  sustainability  and  good  governance;  (ii) timely  completion  by  the \ninstitutions  of  agreed  actions;  and  (iii) adherence  to  restructuring/institutional  strengthening \nbenchmarks  by  the  institutions.  The  intention  is  not  to  abruptly  close  or  disrupt  RFIs,  but  to \nassist their transformation into sustainable entities and provide adequate deposit protection.  \n \n51. \nCooperative Rural  Bank Reforms.  The  Ministry  of  Co-operatives  (MOC),  as  part  of \nRFSDP, has adopted a  CRB  Restructuring  Policy  including  a  model  CRB  Restructuring  Plan \nand  CRB  Fund  Rules  (Supplementary  Appendix 3).  The  first  stage  of  CRB  reforms  will \ncommence with the preparation of the restructuring plan for participating CRBs covering (i) due \ndiligence  process  for  demarcating  assets  and  liabilities  between  the  parent  multipurpose \ncooperative  society  and  the  participating  CRB,  (ii) constitution  of  the  CRB  board  of  directors, \nand (iii) assessment of the amount required for capital adequacy of the CRB. Individual CRBs \nwill  then  finalize  and  adopt  the  plan  and  enter  into  a  formal  agreement  with  MOC  (CRB \nRestructuring Committee) for implementation. Capitalization support will then be provided from \nthe CRB Fund. At the end of the first stage, a participating CRB will become a  distinct financial \nentity  with  separate  statement  of  accounts  under  the  Cooperative  Societies  Act  of  1972. \nMeeting  the  performance  benchmarks  in  the  CRB  restructuring  plans  will  be  required  for \ncontinued RFSDP assistance. The second stage comprises implementation of the restructuring \nplan with support for institutional strengthening from the project loan (para. 79).  \n \n52. \nRegional Development Bank Reforms. RFSDP will support reforms of RDBs where up \nto  80%  of  the  CBSL  stake  has  been  divested  and  financial  restructuring  for  ensuring  capital \nadequacy  undertaken.  As  part  of  RFSDP,  the  CBSL  stake  has  been  transferred  to  the \nGovernment  for  initiating  divestment through the Public Enterprise Reform Commission. MRE, \nin  consultation  with  CBSL,  has  prepared  draft  information  memorandums  for  divestment \nincluding diagnostic studies and portfolio audits. Subsequent to divestment, MRE in consultation \nwith CBSL and the concerned RDBs, will prepare RDB restructuring plans (phase one) covering \n(i) good  governance,  (ii) human  resources,  (iii) business  processes,  (iv) MIS,  (v) auditing  and \naccounting, and (vi) performance benchmarks. The plans will be implemented with support from \nthe project loan (para. 79).  \n \nNational  Development  Trust  Fund  Reforms.  As  part  of  RFSDP,  NDTF  has  been \n53. \nincorporated  as  a  company  limited  by  guarantee  for  enhanced  governance  and  operational \nflexibility, and for establishing a distinct borrower and lender relationship with participating RFIs. \nIn  consultation  with  ADB,  NDTF  will  develop  and  adopt  an  NDTF  Corporate  Plan  covering \n(i) strategy,  (ii) organization  and  human  resources  development,  (iii) operational  policies  and \nguidelines  for  finance  activities,  (iv) policies  and  procedures  for  nonfinance  activities,  and \n(v) partnership arrangements with RFIs. The plan will include performance benchmarks and will \n\n \n \n\n\f15\n\nbe implemented with support from the project loan (para. 79). The aim is to transform NDTF into \nan  effective  microfinance  apex  agency  for  enhancing  the  capacity  and  outreach  of  MF-NGOs, \nespecially in conflict-affected areas.  \n \nSamurdhi  Banking  Society  Reforms.  As  part  of  RFSDP,  SBSs  has  completed  a \n54. \ndiagnostic study and portfolio audit as a basis for determining institutional strengthening options \nin consultation with ADB. Based on the agreed option, the Ministry of Samurdhi will prepare an \nSBS  Institutional  Strengthening  Plan  covering  (i) governance,  (ii) organization  and  human \nresources,  (iii) operational  policies  and  guidelines,  (iv) MIS,  (v) accounting  and  auditing, \n(vi) business  and  viability  projections,  and  (vii) implementation  schedule.  The  objective  of  the \nplan is to ensure good governance and sustainability of SBSs, which is critical for a significant \npoverty  reduction  impact  with  a  gender  emphasis.  The  plan  will  include  performance \nbenchmarks and will be implemented with support from the project loan (para. 79).  \n\n \nd. \n\nStrengthening the Demand Side  \n\n \nRFIs mirror the conditions of the activities they finance, and the quality of their portfolios \n55. \ndepends  on  the  condition  of  the  enterprises  to  which  they  lend.  In  order  to  address  the  real \nsector issues for enhancing rural productivity, as part of RFSDP the Government  has redrawn \nthe scope of the RERF for investments in skills development; marketing networks; infrastructure \nfor  enhancing  better  price  realization  of  rural  produce;  community  infrastructure  such  as \nstorage, small-scale irrigation; and farmer information centers (Appendix 10). RERF will support \nsuch activities mainly through community-led development initiatives in collaboration with NGOs \nand with full beneficiary participation, including cost sharing and control of investments.30 RERF \nactivities  will  be  coordinated  with  ongoing  and  planned  ADB-funded  projects.  Guidelines on \nsanction, usage, and monitoring of RERF formulated in consultation with ADB, NGOs, women\u2019s \ngroups,  and  RFIs  have  been  adopted  by  MRE  (Supplementary  Appendix 4). The  location  of \nRERF  in  MRE ensures coordination with RFIs, as MRE is also the nodal ministry for RFSDA \nand RDBs.  \n \n56. \nThe involvement of rural communities in identifying, planning, executing, and monitoring \nsubprojects  will  help  expand  the  RF  market  and  maintain  peer  pressure  as  a  substitute  for \nphysical collateral, which the poor do not possess.  RERF will help realize the  inherent synergy \nbetween  the  social  and  financial  intermediation  provided  by  specialized  agencies.  An  added \nadvantage is the elimination of duplication of investments in social intermediation by a multitude \nof agencies, often done inefficiently. In the process, the RFIs, especially MF-NGOs, will be able \nto concentrate on acquiring much needed financial skills.31 \n\n \ne. \n\nExpansion of Rural Finance in Conflict-Affected Areas  \n\n \nAs  part  of  RFSDP,  measures  for  the  expansion  of  RF  services  in  the  conflict-affected \n57. \nareas  (para. 32)  will  be  continually  assessed  and  identified  in  consultation  with  ADB  to  help \nensure a systematic institutionalized response including (i) supporting institutional strengthening \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2000.  Finance For the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. This identifies social intermediation \nas a core strategic element. ADB-funded PAK: Microfinance Sector Development Program created an arrangement \nsimilar  to  RERF  for  demand-side  development  that  has  led  to  positive  externalities  for the microfinance sector. \nADB-funded  MON:  Rural  Finance  Project  also  supports  the  establishment  of  Information  Resource  Centers  for \nenhancing  the  capacity  of  rural  borrowers  through  a  participatory  process  involving  NGOs  and  community \norganizations for effectively utilizing access to RF services.  \n\n31 To be provided under the Project Loan component for Building Sector Capacity (para. 77).  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n \n\n \n\nof  new  RFIs,32  (ii) prioritizing  reform  of  CRBs  in  the  region,  (iii) activating  and  concentrating \nRERF  interventions  in  the  region,  and  (iv) ensuring  coordination  with  other  initiatives.33  The \nGovernment, as part of RFSDP, has allocated  10% each of the RERF and the rural enterprise \ndevelopment credit (para. 80) for the expansion of RF in the  conflict-affected areas. In addition, \nRFSDP will provide institutional strengthening support to MF-NGOs and commercial banks that \nseek to expand their operations in the conflict-affected areas.  \n\n \n3.  Important Features  \n\n \n58. \nRFSDP  integrates  the  key  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  strategies  for  poverty  reduction,  the \nprivate sector, and microfinance development, as well as ADB\u2019s RF market analysis.34 RFSDP \nprovides  a  lead  role  for  ADB  in  RF,  which  is  critically  linked  to  a  range  of  rural  sector \ninterventions.  Further,  RFSDP  design  directly  contributes  to  the  goals  of  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic reform program (para. 3). \n \n59. \nLinkages. RFSDP is anchored with the reforms in the banking sector and is consistent \nwith  ADB-funded  projects  and  sector  development  programs  relating  to  small  and  medium \nenterprises,  rural  development,  and  plantation  development  (Appendix 7).  RFSDP  will  also \nbenefit  from  ADB-funded  infrastructure  projects  that  will  facilitate  greater  exchange  of  goods \nand services and linkages between rural and urban sectors. In addition, the ongoing  structural \nadjustment process (para. 3) creates better conditions for a market-based RF sector.  \n \n60. \nRealistic Agenda.  The  scope  of  reforms  and  corresponding  agencies  are  based  on \ncommitment  to  reforms  and  significance  of  impact.  RFSDP  has  been  developed  by  absorbing \nsuccessful  international  and  local  practices  and  RFSDP-supported  reforms are sequenced for \ngenerating increasing acceptance among stakeholders during implementation. Besides potential \nsustainability,  an  important  criterion  for  the  selection  of  RFIs 35  for  reform  is  their  presence  in \nconflict-affected areas for enabling an effective response with the onset of peace. \n \n61. \nGood  Governance.  RFSDP  emphasizes  a  comprehensive  range  of  restructuring \nmeasures,  as  incremental  changes  are  insufficient  for  good  governance.  Accordingly,  RFSDP \nfundamentally  alters  the  norms  for  governance  of  selected  RFIs,  particularly  the  CRBs. \nExtensive use of IT and MIS upgrading will facilitate transparency.  \n \n62. \nStrengthening the Private Sector and Civil Society. RFSDP supports RFIs that either \nhave private sector interest or are in the process of increasing their private sector stake. CRBs \nand SBS are member-based entities, while CBSL\u2019s stake in RDBs is to be divested. In addition, \nthe  RFSD  Act  provides  legal  status  for  MF-NGOs,  which  are  mostly  private,  for  mobilizing \nsavings.  Assured  funding  from  RERF  for  social  intermediation  through  NGOs  and  community-\nbased organizations will contribute to gender equality.  \n\n                                                 \n32 Budgeted under the Project Loan (para.79).  \n33 ADB. 2003.

Rural Financial Markets in Asia: Policies, Paradigms and Performance. Manila. This \nis part (volume 3) of ADB. 2000. Study of Rural Asia, published by Oxford University Press.  \n\n35  SBS,  CRBs,  and  NDTF  (through  participating  RFIs)  have  presence  in  conflict-affected areas. The Government \n\nintends to revisit its plans to establish RDBs in conflict-affected areas when the security situation improves.  \n\n \n \n\n\f17\n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n63. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $50 million from its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) for RFSDP, with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offer rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%36  of  the  loan \namount; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n \nThe  use  of  ADB  funds  is  in  support  of  policy  reforms  that  address  politically  sensitive \n64. \nlong-standing issues and socially significant measures to enhance outreach to the rural sector. \nThe  fundamental  shift  in  the  RF  paradigm  is  reflected  in  (i) emphasis  on  depoliticization, \nautonomy,  good  governance,  and  sustainability;  (ii) encouraging  private  sector  participation  in \nRF  for  enhancing  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities  for  the  poor;  and \n(iii) recognizing and supporting the role of MF-NGOs.  \n \n65. \nThe reforms ensure support for social sectors where continued and direct government \ninvolvement  is  warranted.  Phasing  out  misdirected  and  nontargeted  subsidies  through \ninstitutional reforms will enhance the fiscal space of the Government. This will enable release of \nfunds,  among  others,  for  social  sectors  as  well  as  for  relief  and  reconstruction  in  conflict-\naffected  areas.  RFSDP  reforms  also  significantly  reduce  the  risks  to  the  savings  of  the  poor \nhouseholds  held  with  weak  RFIs,  thus  enabling  the  Government  to  avoid  the  increased  social \nand financial costs of delayed reforms. Most significantly, the enhanced access to a range of RF \nservices  will  enable  rural  households  to  take  advantage  of  economic  opportunities  that  new \ntechnology in manufacturing and agriculture provides. \n \nThe  estimated  direct  cost  of  implementing  RFSDP  reforms  at  $70 million37  include: \n66. \n(i) operationalizing RFSDA ($10 million), comprising office and administrative costs ($5 million) \nand  cost  of  due  diligence  of  RFIs  ($5 million);38  (ii) CRB  reforms  ($35 million),  comprising \ncapitalization costs, at approximately SLRs5 million per CRB ($15 million)39 and erosion of value \nin  loans  and  investments  ($20 million);40  (iii) RDB  restructuring,  $5 million;41  (iv) RERF, \n$10 million;42 (v) NDTF reforms, $5 million; and (vi) SBS reforms, $5 million.43 RFSDP has been \ndesigned  in  view  of  the  prevailing  fiscal  stress  on  the  Government.  Accordingly,  the  RFSDP \nprogram  loan  meets  70%  of  the  estimated  costs.  With  improving  sustainability,  the  RFIs  are \nexpected  to  generate  surpluses,  thus  potentially  obviating  the  need  for  further  government \ninvestment in the RF sector.  \n\n \n5. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\na. \n\nProgram Management  \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and  Implementation  (MPDI)  will  be  the  Executing \n67. \nAgency (EA) and will coordinate with CBSL, MOC, MRE, Ministry of Samurdhi, and Ministry of \n                                                 \n36 The 0.5% front-end fee is only for loans approved during 2003. \n37 These estimates exclude institutional strengthening costs covered by the project loan.  \n38 Starting in year 4, the licensing fee paid by RFIs will meet part of RFSDA expenses. \n39 CRBs in their existing form do not have equity.  \n40 This  is  at  best  conservative,  as  CRB  loans  to  multipurpose  cooperative  societies  are  inadequately  recorded  and \nmany multipurpose cooperative societies are insolvent. Experience from commercial bank reforms indicate that the \nerosion in assets turns out to be more than estimates. \n\n41 The valuation of CBSL stake in RDBs is expected to be lower than the paid up amount.  \n42 This refers to social intermediation in coordination with RFIs.  \n43 The audits indicate unrealized losses in NDTF and SBS.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n \n\n \n\nFinance on policy reforms. MPDI will establish a program management unit (PMU), headed by a \nprogram director, who will be the Additional Secretary of MPDI, for monitoring implementation. \nThe  program  director  will  be  assisted  by  two  directors  and  four  full-time  staff, recruited with \nRFSDP support, with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. MRE (for RERF, RDBs, \nand RFSDA), MOC (for CRBs), NDTF (for NDTF), and the Ministry of Samurdhi (for SBSs) will \nbe implementing agencies (IAs) and will set up program implementation units (PIUs). Each PIU \nwill have a program director supported by one specialist staff with qualifications and experience \nacceptable  to  ADB.  MPDI  will  constitute  a  program  steering  committee,  for  interagency \ncoordination, comprising the heads of the PIUs and a representative each from the  Ministry of \nFinance and MPDI. The steering committee will select a chairperson from amongst its members \nand meet every quarter. A program organization chart is in Appendix 11. \n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n68. \n\nThe 4-year implementation period will be completed by December 2007 (Appendix 12).  \n\n \nc. \n\n \nd. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n69. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix 13).  The \nGovernment  will  certify  that  (i) if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,  the \nvalue  of  eligible  imports  in  the  period  concerned  will  exceed  the  amount  of  the  requested \nwithdrawal  or  (ii) if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible \nimports in the immediately preceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount \nof the requested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the period.  \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nAn  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  undertaken  if  requested  by  ADB  and \n70. \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen a deposit account at CBSL to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be established, \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to  ADB. The PMU will \nsend quarterly progress reports to ADB on policy and institutional reforms. \n \n\ne.     Counterpart Funds  \n\n \n71. \nAs  part  of  RFSDP,  the  Government  will  contribute  the  counterpart  funds  for  RFSDA \n($10 million),  CRB  ($10 million),  and  RERF  ($10 million)  from  the  first  and  second  tranches \n(para. 72).  Balance  counterpart  funds  from  first  and  second  tranches  as  well  as  counterpart \nfunds  from  subsequent  tranches  will  be  allocated  in  consultation  with  ADB.  Precise  and \nmonitorable  dedication  of  counterpart  funds  through  explicit  commitments  directly  supports \nRFSDP reforms and contributes to the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s poverty reduction goals. \n\n \nf. \n\nTranching and Monitoring \n\n \n72. \nThe  program  loan  will  be  released  over  a  4-year  period  after  loan effectiveness in four \ntranches to meet the expected occurrence of associated costs. The first tranche of $15 million \nwill be released on loan effectiveness, the second tranche of $20 million within 12 months of the \nfirst  tranche,  the  third  tranche  of  $10 million  within  18  months  of  the  second  tranche,  and  the \n\n \n \n\n\f19\n\nfourth tranche of $5 million within 18 months of the third tranche, subject to compliance with the \nconditions for their release. \n \n73.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix  attached  to  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 8). Both the Government and ADB will regularly and closely \nmonitor RFSDP implementation. Special audits and reviews will be conducted periodically.  \n \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\n \n74. \nThe PMU will establish and maintain a program performance management system that \nwill include a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix. This will be linked with the project performance management system (para. 99).  \n\n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n75. \nThe Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear  2  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  reform  measures  and  their  impact  on  the  RF  sector.  In \naddition,  ADB  will  also  monitor implementation through periodic reviews and progress reports. \nADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews  throughout  the  implementation  period.  These  will  help  in \nidentifying further actions for the continued development of the RF markets. \n \nC. \n\nThe Project Loans  \n\n1. \n\nObjectives  \n\n \n76. \nThe project loans\u2019 objective is to strengthen key sector institutions for providing training \nin RF, efficient service delivery, sector supervision, and outreach expansion. Strengthening key \nsector institutions will increase the access of rural households to RF services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n77. \nBuilding Sector Capacity.  RFSDP  will  support  the  CBS  as  a  center  for  excellence  in \nRF.  CBS  capacity  (para. 18)  will  be  enhanced  to  (i) create  awareness  of  the  possibilities, \nprospects,  and  risks  in  RF;  (ii) improve  governance  of  RF  operations;  (iii) undertake demand \nassessment  for  developing  products  and  services  in  line  with  nature  of  demand  with  due \nrecognition  of  gender  dimensions;  (iv) institute  enhanced  portfolio  management  capability; \n(v) design systems and procedures for reducing the cost of delivery of RF services; (vi) enhance \nenvironmental  awareness  and  social  safeguard  screening  steps \nin  credit  appraisal; \n(vii) disseminate  RF  best  practices;  and  (viii) strengthen linkages between commercial banks, \nRFIs,  and  MF-NGOs.  Using  its  facilities,  CBS  will  provide  extensive  training  for  RFI  staff \nincluding training for trainers. Support, through CBS, will be provided to the Rural Development \nTraining  Institute  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  social  intermediation  with  an  emphasis  on \ngender  aspects  that  could  be  mainstreamed  through  RERF  interventions.  RFSDP  will \ncoordinate  with  funding  agencies  that  have  RF  interventions.44  RFSDP  will  support  capacity \nbuilding  of  commercial  banks,  through  the  CBS,  to  upgrade  their  RF  operations  as  well  as \nstrengthen  their  RF  operations  in  conflict-affected  areas.  All  materials  and  reports  developed \nwith RFSDP support will be placed on the CBS web site. After the midterm review, RFSDP will \n(i) support the consolidation of the outputs into a distance learning diploma course through the \n\n                                                 \n44  Work undertaken by GTZ of Germany with the People\u2019s Bank will be considered for replication.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n \n\n \n\nOpen University45 and (ii) consider the transfer of the facilities and skills developed at CBS with \nRFSDP support to the proposed new RF training center that CBSL is envisaging. \n \n78. \nDeveloping  Financial  Infrastructure.  Institutional  development  support  for  RFSDA \n(paras.  46\u201349)  will  include  (i) organizational  design;  (ii) operating  procedures  including  off-site \nand on-site supervision; (iii) prudential standards for RFIs including reporting, audit, accounting, \nand  MIS;  and  (iv) MIS  and  IT  design  and  equipment  for  RFSDA.  Assistance  will  also  cover \ntraining and skills development of RFSDA staff. In addition, RFSDP will, through RFSDA or any \nappropriate agency, support private sector audit and credit-rating firms for developing their RFI \nappraisal skills with emphasis on governance, accounts, and MIS.  \n \n79. \nRural  Finance  Institution  Restructuring.  Following  the  adoption  of  policy  reforms \n(paras. 50\u201354), the second stage of institutional reforms will constitute the implementation of the \nCRB Restructuring Plan, RDB Restructuring Plan, NDTF Corporate Plan, and SBS Institutional \nStrengthening Plan. The scope will cover governance, organization, human resources, business \nprocesses,  and  products  and  services.  The  reorienting,  redesigning,  and  repackaging  of \nproducts  and  services  as  well  as  of  systems  and  procedures  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure \nminimal transaction cost. IT and MIS  architecture will be upgraded in line with international best \npractices in business processes.  In addition, institutional strengthening of those MF-NGOs that \nmeet the RFSDA licensing criteria will be available through NDTF, especially for expanding their \noperations in the conflict-affected areas.  \n  \n80. \nRural  Enterprise  Development.  RFSDP  will  provide  onlending  support  to  RFIs  that \nmeet predetermined eligibility criteria. The onlending support ($10 million equivalent) will be only \nfor  subloans  not  exceeding  SLRs100,000  targeted  at  micro  enterprises  and  small  rural \nenterprises. To start with, 10% of the credit line will be for conflict-affected areas. Three fourths \nof  the  credit  line  by  amount  will  be  for  women  entrepreneurs  (paras.  8  and  11).  As  regards \nmitigating demand and supply gaps for rural credit for larger loans (para. 31), RFSDP, through \nprioritizing institutional reforms, provides the basis for RFIs to enhance outreach by mobilizing \nas well as prudently deploying client savings. This approach will provide much greater prospects \nfor sustained outreach than a finite credit line.  \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features  \n\nProject  Implementation  Support.  RFSDP will support the establishment and capacity \n81. \nbuilding  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs  for  the  following:  (i) MPDI  for  overall  coordination;  (ii) MRE  for \nRERF  and  RFSDA  implementation,  and  RDB  reform  coordination;  (iii) MOC  for  coordinating \nCRB reforms and effective use of the CRB Fund; and (iv) NDTF and SBS for effective project \nimplementation. RFSDP will provide partial operating support cost to the EA and IAs.  \n \n \n \nSector  capacity  building  and  application  of  IT  provides  the  basis  for  upgrading, \n82. \nmanaging, and sustaining RF sector improvements. Capacity building will enhance the ability of \nRFIs to develop new client-centered products and the credit line will facilitate immediate delivery \nof  credit  products  including  in  resource  poor  and  conflict-affected  areas.  Further,  institutional \nstrengthening  is  expected  to  produce  a  stream  of  benefits  that  includes  efficiency  and  greater \noutreach within a transparent supervisory environment. Commercially viable orientation of RFIs \nwill facilitate their linkages with the financial sector. \n \n\n                                                 \n45 The Open University is the IA for Loan No. 1999-SRI (SF): Distance Education Modernizing Project, for $45 million.  \n\n \n \n\n\f21\n\n83.  Women who own very few assets and little land will especially benefit, as they are often \ndisadvantaged  due  to  collateral  constraints.  In  addition  to  the  allocation  of  75%  of  the  rural \nenterprise development credit, RFSDP design mainstreams gender concerns through (i) gender \nawareness  training  to  promote  gender  balanced  client  outreach  and  (ii) encouraging  RFIs  to \nformulate  business  plans,  which  include  quantifiable  targets  for  gender  outreach,  especially  in \nconflict-affected  areas.  Further,  the  community  investment  planning  process  under  RERF  will \ninclude needs assessment of female community members.  \n \n\n \n4. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n84. \nThe estimated cost of $27.79 million equivalent (Table 1), comprises $3.64 million (13%) \nin  foreign  exchange  and  $24.15 million  equivalent  (87%)  in  local  currency  costs  (Appendix 14, \nand Supplementary Appendix 5).

The  Borrower  will  be  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.  The \nOCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \n86. \nA  loan  of  $10  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  support \nbuilding  sector  capacity,  RFI  restructuring,  developing  financial  infrastructure,  and  project \nimplementation. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The loan \nwill have 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years;  and with an interest rate charge of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the Project Loan Agreement. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n \n\n \n\nThe provision of local currency costs is considered warranted for ensuring that sufficient \n87. \nand  timely  funding  is  available  for  outreach  expansion  and  institutional  strengthening,  thereby \nminimizing the risk of implementation delay. Country considerations justify higher local currency \nfinancing,  especially  when  the  Government has shown willingness to borrow OCR funds for a \ncore  poverty  intervention.  The  Government  has  made  concerted  efforts  to  maintain domestic \ninvestment levels to sustain growth, but the country faces persistent budget pressures, arising \nfrom, among others, the civil conflict.

PIUs will \nsubmit information and analysis to the PMU and coordinate the fielding and work of consultants. \nThe  PMU  will  ensure  submission  of  periodic  reports.  Sound  accounting  and  internal  control \nsystems will be adopted by the PMU.  \n \n89. \n \n\nFlow of Funds. The following terms and conditions will apply for disbursements: \n\nBuilding sector capacity: grant from the Government to CBSL. \n\nDeveloping financial infrastructure: grant from the Government to RFSDA. \n\nRFI  restructuring:  grants  for  RFIs  except  for  RDBs.  For  the  divested  RDBs, \nsupport will be available as soft loans through NDTF under terms and conditions \nlaid down in a separate subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB.  \n\nRural  enterprise  development:  Ministry  of  Finance  will  relend  to  NDTF  at \naverage  weighted  deposit  rates  under  the  terms  and  conditions  laid  down  in  a \nseparate  subsidiary  loan  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB  (Supplementary \nAppendix 6). A service charge will be admissible to NDTF. \n\n(v) \n\nProject implementation support: grant from the Government to EAs and IAs. \n\n \n90.  Management  of  Cooperative  Rural  Bank  Fund  and  Rural  Economy  Resuscitation \nFund.  Each  fund  is  governed  by  specific  rules,  to  ensure  that  the  specified  objectives  are \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f23\n\nachieved.  Independent  auditors  will  annually  audit  both  funds  and  their  usage  and  the  reports \nwill be made public.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nThe  CRB  Restructuring  Committee  at  MOC  will  manage  the  CRB  Fund.  CRB \ninclude  (i) fund  description  and \nFund  Rules  (Supplementary  Appendix 3) \ndefinitions,  (ii) objectives  and  purposes,  (iii) contributions  and  investments, \ngovernance  and  administration,  (iv) annual  reports  and  audits,  and  (v) eligible \ninstitutions.  To  be  eligible,  CRBs  will  adopt  and  abide  by  the  restructuring  plan \nperformance benchmarks. Capitalization support from the CRB Fund will be long-\nterm loans at a cost to be determined by MOC. These loans will be converted to \nsubordinated  debt  (Tier  II  capital)  after  3  years  at  mutually  agreed  terms, \nincluding dividends, provided that the CRBs demonstrate positive performance.  \n\nfor  RERF \n\nInvestment  and  Operations \n\nRERF will be invested in long-term treasury bills and the revenue generated will \nbe  transferred  quarterly  to  a  designated  bank  account  of  MRE  for  ensuring a \nrealistic disbursement schedule.46 An RERF Secretariat, established in terms of \n(Supplementary \nthe  Guidelines \nAppendix 4), will undertake administration of the RERF, select service providers, \nenter  into  partnership  agreements,  appraise  proposals,  and  make  payments \nbased  on  invoices  to  the  account  of  service  providers  after  documentary \nevidence.  While  RERF  investments  will  be  grants  for  rural  poor  communities, \nRERF may seek capital repayments in the event that any investment generates a \ncash flow. All such cash inflows, however, will have to be reinvested in RERF.  \n \nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\n \n91. \n\nThe 4-year implementation period will be completed by December 2007 (Appendix 12).  \n\n \nc. \n \n\nProcurement  \n\n92. \nProcurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of ADB's Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Vehicles  and  office  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  packages  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through \ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  packages  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  equivalent. \nFor  packages  below  $100,000  equivalent  direct  purchase  may  be  used.  Indicative  contract \npackages and mode of procurement are in Appendix 15.  \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n93. \nA  total  of  58  person-months  of  international  and  628  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  financed  by  the  project  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(Supplementary  Appendix 7).  Consulting  services  will  support  building  sector  capacity  (82 \nperson-months); RFI restructuring (307 person-months); developing financial infrastructure (120 \nperson-months);  and  project  implementation  support  (177  person-months).  The  consulting \ninputs  reflect  the  need  to  ensure  that  adequate  technical  skills  are  continuously  available \nthroughout RFSDP in view of sector capacity constraints, the range of RFIs being reformed, and \nthe strengthening of the PMU and PIUs. Consulting inputs mitigate the risk of frequent changes \n\n                                                 \n46 This mechanism provides a  long-term assured source of funding and ensures adequate controls for selection of \nsubprojects  that  provide  greater  social  and  economic  returns.  An  assured  funding  source  will  encourage  NGO \nservice providers to specialize and work toward improving their efficiency in social service delivery. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n \n\n \n\n(para. 115) of personnel associated with RFSDP implementation. They also ensure appropriate \ntechnical inputs that would otherwise not be possible in view of the budget constraints facing the \nEA  and  IAs.  The  consultants  will  be  placed  in  the  IAs,  and  within  the  IAs  to  respective \nspecialized agencies, such as for RFSDA and RERF within MRE. \n \n94. \nAll  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. Where firms are to be engaged, the \nquality  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  simplified procedures  will be used for consultant \nselection.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  by  MPDI  on  behalf  of  all  IAs.  To  facilitate consultant \nrecruitment, position-based terms of reference and indicative consulting packages are provided \nin Supplementary Appendix 7. \n \ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n95.  MPDI,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will  open  at  CBSL,  within  1  month  of  loan \neffectiveness,  an  imprest  account  denominated  in  US  dollars.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \nLoan  Disbursements  dated  January  2001  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement \nOperations\u2014LIBOR-Based  Loan  Products  dated  July  2002.  ADB  will  advance  6  months  of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the total whichever is lower into the imprest account for each \nof the OCR and Special Funds resource loans. Foreign exchange payments or letters of credit, \nas  well  as  local  currency  expenditures,  may  be  paid  out  of  the  imprest  account.  The  ADB \nstatement of expenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account \nfor individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n \n96. \nThe EA and IAs will maintain separate records and accounts, adequate to identify goods \nand  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  disclose  the  use  of  such  goods  and \nservices  following  sound  accounting  principles.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  such \nrecords  and  accounts  annually.  Within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  certified \ncopies of the audit report together with the auditor\u2019s opinion will be submitted to the Government \nand  ADB.  The  audit  reports  will  include  a  separate opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand statement of expenditure procedures.  \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports  \n\n \nThe  PMU  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  project \n97. \nadministration,  and  financial  management.  The  reports  will  include  (i) quarterly  and  annual \nproject implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and (iii) a project completion report \nto  be  submitted  not  later  than  6  months  after  project  completion.  The  reports,  consolidating \ninputs from IAs, will cover (i) expenditures, (ii) activities financed, (iii) highlights of audit reports, \n(iv) training  activities  and  their  impact,  (v) institutional  strengthening,  (vi) rural  enterprise \ndevelopment, and (vii) progress on RF expansion in conflict-affected areas. These aspects will \nbe discussed in greater detail in the annual reports.  \n \n98. \nThe Government will  maintain separate records and accounts for the imprest account \nand  project  expenditure  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  will  have  such \naccounts  and  records  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The Government will \nensure  that  the  submission  of  project  reports,  audited  accounts,  and  financial  statements  is  in \ncompliance with ADB's guidelines. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB, will audit RFSDA, \nRERF, participating RDBs, and consolidated accounts for NDTF and SBS. The audit reports will \n\n \n \n\n\f25\n\nbe submitted to ADB within 9 months of the reporting period. MOC will provide the key findings \nof CRB reforms and summarize audit findings of participating CRBs. The auditors will also carry \nout inspection of physical activities.  \n  \n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n99.  MPDI,  drawing  on  data  from  IAs,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance \nmanagement system that will generate semiannual and annual reports. The information system \nwill comprise (i) financial and efficiency indicators of RFIs;47 (ii) number of borrowers by gender \nand  poverty  classification,  type  of  services,  and  the  size  of  transactions;  and  (iii) social \nintermediation  outreach.  The  IAs  will  periodically  monitor  the  socioeconomic  indicators  of \nborrowers such as income, asset holding, and employment status to measure poverty outreach \nand  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  RFSDP.  RFI  restructuring  and  institutional  strengthening  will \nprovide financial benchmarks  \n \n\nh. \n\nProject Reviews  \n\n \n100.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  periodically  review  project  implementation.  The  reviews \nwill include evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with IAs \nand  participating  RFIs,  implementation  of  RFI  restructuring,  progress  with  the  policy  reform \nagenda, and capacity-building measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including a \nmidterm  review  mission,  and  project  com pletion  review  missions.  A  comprehensive  midterm \nreview at the end of year 2 will be undertaken to evaluate actual physical and financial progress. \nBased on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n \n1. \n\nPolicy \n\n \n101.  RFSDP  represents  a  shift  toward  a  financial  system  development  approach  where \nsustainable RFIs, over a time, are expected to attain greater outreach, including to the poor, and \nproduct diversity, resulting in more clients served and their diverse needs met. Sustainability will \ndiminish  political  interference  by  reducing  the  dependence  on  government  resources  and \nsubsidies,  which  in  turn  will  enable  the  Government  to  increase  development  investment. \nIncreased access to RF services will facilitate growth and diversification of private sector rural \nenterprises,  for  both  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors,  which  will  generate  local  employment \nopportunities  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nreforms  are  anchored  on  good  governance,  transparency,  and  rigorous  financial  discipline. \nRFSDP supported reforms will strengthen the sector through the following: \n \n(i) \n\nRFIs  can  better  respond  to  growth  opportunities  when  they  operate  in  a  conducive \npolicy  environment  and  are  appropriately  governed.  RFSDP  provides  the  framework \nand incentives for sustainable RF markets to develop.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n47 RFI  restructuring  and  institutional  strengthening  plans  will  provide  financial  benchmarks.  The  model  CRB \nRestructuring Plan includes key performance benchmarks to serve as monitoring indicators. Similar performance \nbenchmarks will be developed for effective monitoring in consultation with other RFIs.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nRFSDP  encourages  private  sector  entry  in  RF  by  demonstrating  the  profit  potential  of \nthe RF sector. The Government\u2019s gradual exit as an RF provider will enable competition \nto emerge, which will improve quality and efficiency.  \n\n \n\nThe  development  of  a  supervisory  and  regulatory  framework  will  contribute  to  financial \nsoundness,  good  governance,  transparency,  and  encourage  integration  of  the  hitherto \nsegmented RF markets with the mainstream financial sector.  \n\nChecks  on  the  proliferation  of  unsustainable  and  ineffectively  supervised  RFIs  will \nreduce regulatory arbitrage and forbearance, and enhance the security of rural savings. \n\nRFSDP will eventually force all RFIs to reform or risk being marginalized. The need for \nbudgetary  support  to  unviable  RFIs  will  diminish  when  the  reformed  RFIs  are  able  to \nsustainably fill outreach gaps.  \n\nSector analysis undertaken in consultation with ADB will make certain that the needs of \nthe  conflict-affected  areas  are  being  appropriately  addressed.  This  will  strengthen \nADB\u2019s lead role in RF sector development. \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional \n\n \n\n102.  RFSDA  will  provide  cost-effective  supervision  appropriate  for  small  RFIs  that  need \nflexibility  and  improvisations.  While  ensuring  prudent  lending  and  investment  decisions,48 \nRFSDA  will  also  facilitate  coordination  of  RF  policies  to  maximize  the  impact  of  rural  sector \ninvestments. In the process, commercial  banks will overcome their apprehension of increasing \ntheir  RF  portfolio.  Prior  RFI  commitment  to  reforms  will  facilitate  and  expedite  the  institutional \ntransformation.  The  resulting  efficiency  and  cost  savings  will  enable  early  recovery  of  RFI \nrestructuring costs. The RFIs can turn themselves around within  3\u20135 years with recapitalization \nand  reduction  in  NPLs,  cost  reductions  due  to  rationalization  of  systems  and  procedures,  and \nMIS  and  IT  upgrading.  In  addition,  improved  repayment  rates  due  to  depoliticization  of  debt \nrecovery will improve portfolio quality.  \n \n\n3.  \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \n103.  Outreach  expansion  will  have  a  significant  employment  generation  and  income \nenhancement  impact.  Direct  employment  will  be  generated  by  the  high  labor  content  of  the \nsmall  rural  and  micro  enterprise  subprojects,  whether  financed  by  the  rural  enterprise \ndevelopment credit (para. 80) or by own funds of RFIs. The estimated 10,000 micro enterprises \nto be financed by the rural enterprise development credit are expected to generate about 10,000 \nfull-time  jobs,  primarily  for  rural  women.  In  addition,  the  RERF  could  support  850  subprojects \neach  requiring  some  200  person-days  equivalent  of  community  labor  with  significant  social \ndevelopment  content,  especially  gender  empowerment.  Such  benefits  include  improved  rural \nhousehold incomes that will result from an increase in the cropping intensity and cultivated area \nwith  better  irrigation,  regular  availability  of  inputs,  application  of  improved  technology,  lower \ntransaction  and  financial  costs,  and  timely  access  to  markets.  Resource  flows  in  conflict-\naffected areas will be assured through specific allocations under RERF and the rural enterprise \ndevelopment credit line.  \n \n\n                                                 \n48  The  RFSD  Act  restricts \n\ninvestments,  sets  capital-adequacy \nrequirements for obtaining and maintaining a license, and requires RFIs to create provisions for deposit protection.  \n\nto  only  government-approved \n\ninvestments \n\n26 \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f27\n\n104.  Enhanced  financial  and  institutional  capacity  of  RFIs  with  RFSDP  support  will  enable \nRFIs  to  deploy  their  funds  (savings  and  borrowings)  in  credit,  thus  reversing  the  flow  of \nresources  from  rural  areas.  Conservatively,  a  one  percentage  point  increase  in  the  credit-to-\ndeposit  ratio  translates  into  nearly  20,000  new  borrowers  at  the  average  micro  loan  size  of \nSLRs20,500.  It  is  expected  that  the  aggregate  credit-to-deposit  ratio  of  RFIs  will  increase  by \n10 percentage  points,  translating  into  200,000  additional  borrowers  during  RFSDP  duration. \nMore  significantly,  RFI  reforms  and  deposit  protection  measures  through  the  RFSD  Act  will \nsignificantly enhance the security of the savings of rural households. Considering that there are \nabout  7 million  savings  accounts  with  RFIs,  their  protection  and  proper  deployment  in  rural \nareas constitutes the most significant benefit of RFSDP.  \n\n \n4. \n\n \n5. \n\nEnvironmental \n\n \n105.  A summary initial environmental examination of farm and nonfarm activities was made \nand  the  results  were  grouped  into  two  broad  classes,  representing  loans  for  small  rural \nenterprises  and  for  micro  enterprises  to  determine  their  impact  on  the  environment.  As \nconcluded in the initial environmental examination, none of the representative farm and nonfarm \nenterprises  is  likely  to  result  in  a  significant  environmental  impact.  There  are  no  negative \nenvironmental impacts that cannot be mitigated. Subborrowers will be required to follow relevant \nenvironmental standards and regulations. As part of building sector capacity, CBS will enhance \nthe environmental management system (para. 77) of the participating RFIs. The summary initial \nenvironment examination is in Supplementary Appendix 8.  \n\nSocial and Poverty  \n\n \n106.  Reducing poverty is best served by reducing the incidence and impact of the causes of \npoverty  for  the  largest  number  of  people.  To  achieve  this,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprogram,49  RFSDP  aims  to  support  pro-poor  RFIs;  capacity  building  of  RFIs  and  their  clients; \naccess  of  the  poor  to  social  services  and  infrastructure  through  RERF;  rural  livelihoods; and \ninvestments in conflict-affected areas. With the participation of major RFIs, the poverty reduction \nimpact  of  RFSDP  reforms  will  be  widespread.  Enhanced  legal  provisions  for  improved \ngovernance  and  sustainability  of  RFIs  increase  the  prospects  to expand RF outreach to meet \nthe growing demand and supply gaps even beyond the life of RFSDP. Increased supply of RF \nwill help rural households intensify and  expand their operations through application of improved \ntechnology. Linkages within the rural economy and between the rural and urban economies will \nalso be stimulated through increased financial intermediation. \n \n107. \nIncreased  and  preferential  support  for  rural  women  entrepreneurs  explicitly  supports \ngender  equity.  In  addition,  RERF  will  ensure  that  rural  women  have  access  to  supporting \nmechanisms  for  access  to  skills,  technology,  and  markets  (paras.  55-56)  along  with  credit. \nCommunity-based projects will also be developed with poor women as a target group. Specific \nallocations  for  conflict-affected  areas  for  RERF  and  rural  enterprise  development  credit  will \nsupport  programs,  such  as  access  to  basic  services  and  livelihood  opportunities  for  women \naffected  by  armed  conflict,  including  war  widows.  For  ensuring  these,  gender  awareness \ntraining and collation of gender-disaggregated data have been integrated into RFSDP design.  \n \n108.  RFSDP  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  and,  thus,  will  not \ntrigger  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement. \n\n                                                 \n49 Government of Sri Lanka. 2002. Regaining Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\n \n\nHowever,  a  social-safeguard  screening  step  has  been  added  to  ensure  that  there  will  be  no \nadverse impacts. A Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \nB.  \n\nRisks   \n\n109.  The RFSDP design is based on lessons learned from successful practices. Success and \nimpact will, though, depend on a number of assumptions that are subject to varying degrees of \nrisk. Mitigating measures have been put in place as appropriate and possible.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Loan  \n\n \n110.  Commitment  to  Reform.  The  lack  of  sustained  government  commitment  to  a  market-\ndriven RF sector is a major risk.  The Government has already committed to reform measures \nrelating  to  good  governance,  effective  supervision,  and  sustainability.  It  is  also  expected  that \nimproved  economic  performance  as  a  result  of  the  ongoing  structural  reforms  will  reduce  the \npressure  on  the  Government  to  intervene  in  the  RF  markets,  especially  for  lowering  lending \ninterest  rates.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  commercial  bank  reforms,  despite  strong \nopposition from staff unions, suggests that RF reforms will also be similarly pursued. \n \n111.  Delay  in  Policy  Reforms.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and \ncapacity-building  support  are  safeguards  for  smooth  implementation  of  policy  reforms.  Public \nawareness  to  convey  the  real  benefits  of  the  reforms  will  further  mitigate  the  possible  risks  of \ndelay  in  policy  reforms.  For  expediting  reforms,  RFSDP  supports  recapitalization  and \ninstitutional strengthening, including technological upgrading for the reforming RFIs.  \n \n112.  Coverage  of  Conflict-affected Areas.  The  realization  of  RFSDP  objectives  depends \nupon  the  ability  of  RFIs  to  operate  effectively  in  the  conflict-affected areas. Some enterprising \nMF-NGOs,  CRBs,  SBSs,  and  commercial  banks  have  already  started  small  RF  operations  in \nthese  areas.  RFSDP  will  encourage  and  facilitate  this  process,  and  simultaneously  invest  in \ninstitutional strengthening for rapid expansion as the situation improves.  \n\n \n2. \n\nProject Loans  \n\n \n113. \nInstitutional Reforms. Decades of politicization have created norms and values in RFIs \nthat are not easily amenable to change. Such norms could affect restructuring, erode autonomy, \nand prevent the expected improvements in repayments from materializing. Factors that diminish \nthe  risks  include  financial  support  for  restructuring  and  upfront  agreement  on  governance \nframework  and  autonomy.  RFSDP  support  is  contingent  on  performance.  Restructuring  plans \nwith  performance  benchmarks  will  be  introduced  to  track  institutional  performance.  RFIs \nappreciate  that  better  performance  will  enable  them  to  expand  their  operations  and  provide  a \ngreater range of services.50 \n \n114.  High Delinquency. RFIs are most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions \nin loan revenues. The following constitute an effective safeguard against delinquency: (i) stricter \napplication  of  legal  measures  for  minimizing  willful  defaults;  (ii) tightening of credit standards, \nmore attention to credit risk, and rigorous credit appraisal through application of IT for improving \nportfolio  quality;  (iii) significant  investment  in  capacity  building  for  adoption  of  successful  RF \npractices; and (iv) in the case of microfinance, peer pressure, to ensure repayments. In addition, \ngovernment commitment not to interfere in lending and loan collections will improve repayment \n\n                                                 \n50 The RFSD Act links the scale and range of operations to financial performance.  \n\n \n \n\n\f29\n\nrates. RFIs will also be adequately capitalized to meet transient risks. Tighter prudential norms \ncould drive up costs in the short term and could even require higher provisioning. However, in \nthe medium to long run these will strengthen viability.  \n \nImplementation  Delays.  Capacity  constraints  and  frequent  changes  in  personnel \n115. \n(para. 93)  at  the  EA  and  the  IAs  might  delay  implementation.

Many  RFIs  have  been  created  by  funding  agencies,  ministries,  and  departments  to \nchannel  rural  credit  under  numerous  government-sponsored  programs  to  special  interest \ngroups.  Practices  that  sharply  deviate  from  prudent  financial  intermediation,  including \nsubsidized interest rates, politicization of benefits, and debt cancellation, have resulted in weak \ncredit discipline and crowding out of the private sector. \n \n2. \nRural  Economy.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  population  was  18.7  million  in  2001.  Its  per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  of  $870  is  the  highest  in  South  Asia.  Sri  Lanka  has  had  relatively  healthy \neconomic  growth,  with  an  average  growth  rate  of  nearly  5%  per  annum  during  the  last  two \ndecades. In terms of human development indicators, Sri Lanka has achieved a level consistent \nwith  those  of  high-income  countries.  However,  economic  growth  has  been  skewed  in  favor  of \nthe  urban  sector.  Concentration  of  industry  close  to  the  main  ports  has  led  to  an  uneven \nregional  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  economic  growth.  Poverty  continues  to  be  widespread, \nwith estimates ranging from 25% to 39% of the population.2 \n \nSri Lanka is primarily a rural economy with almost 80% of the population living in rural \n3. \nareas.  Poverty  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon  with  rural  poverty  incidence  in  some \nregions  being  as  high  as  50%.  Rural  economy  is  adversely  affected  by  stagnant  agriculture \ngrowth, poorly targeted agriculture subsidies, and a weak land tenure and registration system. \nAs  in  the  rest  of  the  region,  production  and  marketing  bottlenecks  due  to  weak  rural \ninfrastructure  and  the  resulting  low  profitability  and  productivity  make  it  difficult  for  the  rural \nsector  in  Sri  Lanka  to  compete  for  investment  capital.  On  the  other  hand,  policies  relating  to \nagriculture repress farm income potential. Absence of forward and backward linkages to support \nvalue addition to rural produce impedes diversification of income sources. \n \n4. \nAs  a  result,  predominantly  agricultural  areas  such  as  the  North-Western  and  Uva \nprovinces  remain  less  developed,  and  the  Southern  province  is  the  poorest  in  terms  of  per \ncapita income and has the highest unemployment rate, outside the conflict-affected areas. Rural \nlabor  cannot  be  absorbed  by  the  nonfarm  sector  due  to  difficulties  in  promoting  viable  rural \nenterprises  including  micro  enterprises  in  an  environment  of  sluggish  macroeconomic  growth, \nsegmented  markets,  and  infrastructure  bottlenecks.  The  rural  economy  is  largely  subsistence \nbased, offering very few opportunities for upward mobility. Low skill levels among the rural poor \nalso inhibit their participation in the local economy. \n \nRF Structure. The RF sector in Sri Lanka consists of (i) the formal sector:3 state-owned \n5. \nand  private  commercial  banks,  National  Savings  Bank  (NSB),  regional  development  banks \n(RDBs)  and  SANASA  Development  Bank  (SDB);  (ii) the  semiformal  sector:  cooperative rural \nbanks  (CRBs),  thrift  and  credit  cooperative  societies  (TCCSs),  Samurdhi  Banking  Societies \n(SBSs),  National  Development  Trust  Fund  (NDTF),  about  200  microfinance-nongovernment \n\n                                                 \n1   In this appendix, the term \u2018RF\u2019 or \u2018RFI\u2019 (RF institution) is inclusive of \u2018MF\u2019 (microfinance) or \u2018MFI\u2019 (MF institution)\u2019, \n\nrespectively. The term \u2019MF\u2019 or \u2018MFI\u2019 is used only for specific MF related reference. \n\n2   Depending  on  the  underlying  poverty  line.  The  official  consumption-based  poverty  line  for  the  chronically poor is \nSLRs860 per adult per month, excluding the north and the east (Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.  Framework for \nPoverty Reduction. Colombo.). \n\n3  Formal sector RFIs include those supervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and semiformal RFIs are \n\nthose established or registered under secondary rules of various laws but not supervised by CBSL. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\norganizations  (MF-NGOs),  private  sector  pawnshops,  and  numerous  programs  of  the \nGovernment  of  Sri  Lanka  with  rural  credit  components;  and  (iii) informal  sources  including \nrotating  savings  and  credit  associations,  input  suppliers,  traders,  moneylenders,  landlords, \nfriends, and relatives.  \n \n6. \nNSB and its predecessors have been mobilizing savings since 1832. Savings and credit \ncooperatives  have  functioned  for  nearly  a  century  and  now  have  five  million  members.  Many \nMF-NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  started  rural  savings  and  group-based lending \nprograms in the 1980s for poverty reduction and social development. Subsequent government \npolicies of providing RF as a tool for poverty reduction required state-owned commercial banks \nto  provide  financial  services  to  the  rural  poor.  In  1986,  the  Government  established  regional \nrural  development  banks  to  provide  normal  and  subsidized  rural  credit,  which  were  later \nconverted into six RDBs. The government-operated SBS program, started in 1997, has grown \nrapidly  in  terms  of  number  of  societies  and  total  loan  portfolio.  As  a  result,  RF  outreach  in  Sri \nLanka is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.  \n \nRFIs  in  Sri  Lanka  have  traditionally  emphasized  savings  (Table  A1.1).  NSB  has \n7. \nSLRs134  billion  in  13.5  million  deposit  accounts,  many  held  by  rural  savers  who  access \naccounts  through  4,042  postal  agencies.  RDBs  also  collect  significant  amounts  of  savings. \nSavings by semiformal RFIs totaled almost SLRs24 billion in 2000. Cooperatives are the largest \nsemiformal mobilizers of savings, accepting almost SLRs20 billion through the CRB and TCCS \nnetworks.  SBSs  also  collect  a  significant  amount  of  savings.  MF-NGOs,  though  not  legally \nallowed,  accept  deposits  either  as  compulsory,  voluntary,  or  equity  contributions.  Commercial \nbanks do not classify their accounts as urban or rural, and are, therefore, not included in Table \nA1.1, but also mobilize savings from rural areas. \n \nTable A1.1: Deposits at Major Rural Financial Institutionsa  \n(SLRs million) \n \n\nSpecial Savings  Fixed Deposits \n\nRural Finance Institutions \nCRBs  \nTCCSs \nSANASA Development Bank \nSBSs \nRDBs  \nSEEDS (MF-NGO) \nJanashakthi (MF-NGO) \nTotal \n\nSavings \n10,870 \n1,757 \n194 \n2,033 \n2,731 \n488 \n21 \n18,094 \n\n\u2014 \n902 \n12 \n\u2014 \n305 \n138 \n7 \n1,364 \n\n3,937 \n739 \n810 \n\u2014 \n899 \n\u2014 \n1 \n6,386 \n\nShares \n\u2014 \n841 \n161 \n983 \n1,060 \n\u2014 \n17 \n3,062 \n\nTotal \n14,807 \n4,239 \n1,177 \n3,016 \n4,995 \n626 \n46 \n28,906 \n\nCRBs  =  cooperative  rural  banks,  TCCSs  =  thrift  and  credit  cooperative  societies,  SBSs  =  Samurdhi  Banking \nSocieties,  RDBs  =  regional  development  banks,  SEEDS  =  Sarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Services, \nMF-NGO = microfinance-nongovernment organization. \na As of December 2000. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

At the prevailing lending interest rate,4 the demand for rural credit is estimated at \nSLRs60  billion.  The  present  supply  of  SLRs50  billion  leaves  a  gap  of  SLRs10  billion.

In the absence of a conducive RF policy, government participation \nand control of RF were perpetuated on the understanding that (i) access to cheap institutional \ncredit could induce investment; (ii) government intervention in the sector was required to ensure \nsufficient  flow  of  rural  credit;  and  (iii) banks,  both  commercial  and  specialized,  had  a  social \nresponsibility  to  serve  the  rural  clientele  even  if  it  meant  incurring  losses.  The  Government \npursued  this  approach  through  directed  credit, state-owned RFIs, concessional refinance, and \nloans at below-cost interest rates. In this repressive environment RFIs and CBs had little, if any, \nincentive  to  adopt  sound  practices  and  enhance  portfolio  quality  through  strict  credit  appraisal \nand delinquency management. As a result, RF suffers from weak governance, poor repayment \nrates,5  high  transaction  costs,  weak  supervision,  and  recurring  losses  that  add  to  the  fiscal \nburden. Despite some success in credit expansion, availability of medium- to long-term credit in \nrural areas has remained limited.  \n \n11. \nThe absence of RF policy has led to proliferation of legislation that allows establishment \nof  fundamentally  unsustainable  RFIs.  More  significantly,  in  the  majority  of  RFIs accountancy \nstandards,  transparency,  management  information  systems,  and  information  technology \nplatforms  are  rudimentary.  In  most  cases  the  real  financial  status  of  RFIs  is  hidden.  CRBs  do \nnot  have  independent  accounting  and  reporting  from  their  parent  multipurpose cooperatives. \nThe  government-sponsored  programs  such  as  SBSs  do  not  include  in  their  accounts \nadministrative costs borne by the Government. Many RFIs are unsupervised or operate without \nproper prudential regulations. Conflicts prevail in terms of ownership and regulation, as CBSL is \n                                                 \n5   Repayment rate refers to collection as a percentage of loans due. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nboth  part  owner  and  regulator  of  RDBs.  Weak  supervisory  infrastructure  in  the  cooperative \nsector  results  in  inadequate  supervision  of  CRBs,  despite  the  fact  that  they  hold  substantial \ndeposits  from  nearly  5  million  members  and  nonmembers.  The  legal  status  of  MF-NGOs \nremains ambiguous in terms of their right to mobilize deposits.  \n \n12. \nThe  performance  of  the  majority  of  RFIs  do  not  conform  to  sustainability  norms  when \nassessed against internationally accepted industry standards. Many RFIs are heavily dependent \non  government  subsidies  and  external  agency  funds  and  the  majority  of  RFIs  are  far  from \nfinancial  self-sufficiency  (Table  A1.3).  Low  sustainability  of  RFIs  stems  from  absence  of \nperformance  management  systems  based  on  tangible  financial  indicators;  lack  of  sufficient \nmanagerial  expertise;  and  deviation  from  best  practice  standards.  In  a  situation  of  recurring \nlosses,  investment  in  institutional  capacity  is  neither  a  priority  nor  are  there sufficient training \ninstitutions and arrangements for meeting capacity-building needs of the RF sector.  \n\n \nTable A1.3: Viability Ratios of Major Rural Financial Institutionsa (%) \n \n\nFinancial Self-Sufficiencyc \n\nOperational Self-Sufficiencyb \n\nprovisions). \n\n83 \n43 \n117 \n72 \n130 \n\n83 \n38 \n103g \n55 \n82 \n\nsubsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \n\nRural Finance Institutions \nCRBs d \nSBSs e \nRDBs f \nSEEDS (MF-NGO) \nJanashakthi (MF-NGO) \nCRBs = cooperative rural banks, SBSs = Samurdhi Banking Societies, RDBs = regional development banks, SEEDS \n= Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Developm ent Services, MF-NGO = microfinance-nongovernment organization. \na  As of December 2001. \nb  Operational  self-sufficiency  =  total  operational  income/(total  operational  costs  +  financing  costs  +  loan  loss \nc  Financial self-sufficiency = total financial revenue/total operational cost - less donations and all subsidies including \nd  Average of five sample well performing and poorly performing CRBs. \ne  Average of three sample average performing SBSs. \nf  Average of six RDBs. \ng  Data for indirect subsidies for RDBs are not available, thus the figure excludes adjustment for subsidies. \nSource:  Annual  reports  of  RFIs;  and  ADB.  2001.

The  weak  credit \ndiscipline that accompanies such interventions is reflected, for instance, in nonperforming loans \nof about 20\u201330% among RFIs and the RF portfolio of commercial banks. Only about two thirds \nof  CRBs  are  reported  to  be  financially  viable.  However,  due  to  lack  of  transparency,  it  is  not \nclear how many are actually profitable after adjustments for loan loss provisions, write-offs, and \nsubsidies. SBSs and other government programs also entail large recurrent costs. While a few \nlarge MF-NGOs are moving toward self-sustainability, the vast majority of smaller and less well-\nestablished  MF-NGOs are not operating on a very sound basis. The lack of transparency and \nstandardized financial reporting impedes a detailed assessment of their financial condition.  \n \n14. \nBesides a general deficiency in service quality, there is growing gap between supply and \ndemand  for  rural  credit  from  formal  and  semiformal  sectors.  The  lowest  end  of  the  market \ncomprising the poor, marginal, and subsistence farmers is restricted to borrowing amounts that \nare much below these people\u2019s needs. For example, most RFIs require collateral such as land \nor  personal  guarantors  for  loans  above  SLRs50,000.  Due  to  this,  rural  small  and  micro \nenterprises  have  great  difficulty  in  borrowing  the  amounts  necessary  for  upscaling  and \ndiversifying, which are also hindered by the low levels of skills in rural areas. Private commercial \nbanks,  while  keen  to  expand  their  rural  outreach,  are  better  equipped  to  provide  larger  loans. \nSystemic linkages between MF-NGOs and commercial banks have yet to emerge.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1  \n\n35\n\nLessons  Learned.  The  evolution  of  RF  markets  in  Sri  Lanka  has  been  considerably \n15. \ndistorted,  resulting  in  fragmented  markets  that  vary  in  development  and  density  by  region. \nHighly  inefficient  supply-driven  application  of  capital  and  weak  nonmarket-driven management \nare generally regarded as the basic reasons for failure. Specific causes of failure revolve around \nhigh operating costs, losses, and decapitalization. The cumulative effect of financial repression \nand dependence on government has affected institutional norms that remain averse to change \nand  accountability.  The  RF  sector  as  a  whole  requires  a  complete  reorientation  before  it  can \nmove  forward  on  a  continuum  toward  self-sufficiency.  A  systemic  response  to  address  the \nissues in RF is essential for reviving the rural economy through investments in agriculture and in \nrural enterprises.  \n \n16. \nStrengthening RF Markets. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic reform program aims \nto  reduce  poverty  and  help  establish  lasting  peace  through  relief,  rehabilitation,  and \nreconstruction  to  reduce  conflict-related  poverty.  Broad-based  rural  development  is  the  key \nstrategy for poverty reduction including employment, income generation, and access to financial \nand business services.  \n \n17. \nThe  most  critical  element  in  the  RF  reform  process  is  a  policy  paradigm  to  shape  the \nnorms  and  incentives  in  which  RFIs  operate  and  enable  sustainable  RF  markets  to  develop. \nThe  paradigm  will  emphasize  a  financial  system  development  approach  where  RF  market \ndevelopment  is  placed  in  the  broader  perspective  of  financial  sector  development.  Direct \ninterventions  by  the  Government  will  be  limited  to  situations  where  identifiable  market  failures \nexist  and  cost-effective,  transparent  means  to  address  them  are  available.  A  supervisory  and \nregulatory framework to stem proliferation of RFIs through a stricter entry threshold and financial \nand operating standards will follow the policy framework. Considering the large number of small \nRFIs, a second tier agency would provide flexible supervisory options compared to CBSL. The \npolicy and regulatory framework will provide the basis for institutional reforms anchored on good \ngovernance,  transparency,  and  rigorous  financial  discipline.  The  private  sector  stake  must  be \ngradually  enhanced  in  the  reformed  RFIs  to  level  the  playing  field  for  competition  and \ncommercialization. Sector capacity constraints must also be simultaneously addressed.  \n \n18. \nConsidering the infrastructure and skills deficit  context in which most RFIs operate, it is \nimportant  that  RF  reforms  are  accompanied  by  significant  investments  in  demand-side \ndevelopment that enable the rural poor, for instance through better skills and access to markets, \nto effectively utilize RF services. For dealing with core poverty issues in conflict-affected areas, \na  flexible  approach  for  reactivating,  strengthening,  or  establishing  new  institutions  is  required. \nWhile  reforms  will  eventually  enable  an  adequate  response  to  demand  and  supply  gaps, \ninvestments  directed  for  specific  underserved  market  niches  will  be  required  in  the  short  to \nmedium term.  \n \nThe  strategic  components  represent  a  shift  to  a  demand-driven  approach  where \n19. \nsustainable RFIs, over a period of time, are expected to achieve greater outreach, including the \npoor, and product diversity resulting in more clients served and their diverse needs better met. \nThis will diminish political interference and willful defaults. The resulting sustainable system will \nbe  able  to  support  income  expansion  and  poverty  reduction  and  reduce  fiscal  pressure, \nenabling increased investment in development. This reform agenda will significantly contribute \nto the Government\u2019s aim to reduce poverty to 20% and increase economic growth to 7% a year \nby 2005. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS \n\nLegal Framework and Ownership  \n\n \nA. \n \nDistrict-based  regional  rural  development  banks  (RRDBs)  established  in  1986  were \n1. \nconsolidated  into  six  regional  development  banks  (RDBs)  in  1997.  This  process  involved \nfinancial consolidation, a broader ownership base, and shareholder-appointed board members. \nThe  paid  up  capital  of  each  RDB  is  SLRs150  million.  As  of  September  2002,  the  majority \nshareholder  was  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  with  participation  of  Bank  of  Ceylon, \nPeople's Bank, National Savings Bank, and CBSL Employee Provident Fund (Table A2.1). Due \nto  its  shareholding  structure,  RDBs  are  categorized  as  quasi-government financial institutions \nand are considered susceptible to political influence. RDBs are under CBSL supervision. There \nis  a  proposal  to  establish  three  RDBs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  of  the  north  and  the  east. \nHowever, no time frame has yet been announced.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Ownership Structure and Network of Regional Development Banksa \n\nRDB \n\nWayamba \n\nKandurata \n\nRuhuna  Rajarata \n\nUva \n\nSabara- \ngamuwa \n\nOwnership (% share) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n\n68 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n\n68 \n  8 \n  8 \n  8 \n  8 \n\n52 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n12 \n\n          34 \n           316 \n\n68 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n \n37 \n347 \n\n        68 \n 8 \n 8 \n 8 \n 8 \n\n  Central Bank of Sri Lanka  \n  Bank of Ceylon  \n  National Savings Bank  \n  People\u2019s Bank  \n  CBSL Employee Provident Fund  \n \n Number of branches  \n Number of staff \na As of September 2002.   \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nRDBs provide normal and subsidized credit to individuals and businesses in rural areas. \nThe  deposit  and  loan  outstanding  amounts  at  end-2001  were  SLRs4.7  billion  and  SLRs5.5 \nbillion,  respectively.  About  80%  of  loans  are  microcredit  loans  under  SLRs100,000.  Personal \nguarantees from customers or immovable property are used as collateral. Lending interest rates \nvary between 12% and 27%. The lending portfolio is diversified (Table A2.2), with pawnbroking \nconstituting nearly half of the portfolio.

In some cases, they have \nshown a tendency to move away from their traditional client base of rural poor and low-income \nhouseholds and provide larger loans. While the average loan size of RDBs is small, this does \nnot necessarily indicate that they are effectively satisfying the credit needs of the rural poor.  \n \nC. \n \nRDBs  inherited  many  portfolio  problems  from  the  RRDBs.  Portfolio  quality  remains \n4. \nproblematic for all six RDBs. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of the total portfolio range \nfrom 16% to 33% (Table A2.3). Each RDB has established a special debt recovery program to \nreduce nonperforming loans. Kandurata, Sabaragamuwa, and Wayamba RDBs show low levels \nof  nonperforming  loans  compared  to  the  other  three  RDBs.  Sabaragamuwa  in  particular  has \nimproved its portfolio quality. Ruhuna, Rajarata, and Uva RDBs have comparatively high levels \nof nonperforming loans, with Rajarata\u2019s loan portfolio having deteriorated over the past 3 years. \nThe aggregate repayment rate (as percentage of amount due) for the RDBs was 88% at end-\n2001. Loans are classified as nonperforming after 90 days and are subject to aging analysis. \n \n\nTable A2. 3: Financial Performance of Regional Development Banksa \n\nSabara- \ngamuwa \n\nPerformance Indicator \n\nWayamba  Kandurata \n\nRuhuna  Rajarata \n\nUva \n\n0.84 \n33 \n824 \n546 \n578 \n100 \n121 \n7 \n7 \n\n-1.48 \n25 \n675 \n441 \n436 \n100 \n126 \n-10 \n-10 \n\n1.44 \n16 \n1,036 \n596 \n728 \n150 \n176 \n24 \n15 \n\n1.44 \n17 \n1,742 \n929 \n1,365 \n150 \n250 \n53 \n25 \n\n0.96 \n16 \n1,558 \n1,073 \n1,091 \n150 \n185 \n15 \n15 \n\n1.24 \n21 \n2,031 \n1,160 \n1,320 \n150 \n316 \n48 \n25 \n\nReturn on Average Assets (%) \nNonperforming portfolio (%) \nTotal assets (SLRs million) \nTotal deposits (SLRs million) \nLoans and advances (SLRs million) \nPaid-up capital (SLRs million) \nTotal shareholder funds (SLRs million) \nProfit Before Tax (SLRs million) \nProfit After Tax (SLRs million) \na As of December 2001. \nSource: Regional Development Banks. \n \nWhile five out of the six RDBs have shown nominal profits, it is not clear whether these \n5. \nprofits  were  adjusted  for  indirect  subsidies.  CBSL  is  of  the  opinion  that  these  reflect  a  true \npicture  and  that  the  profitability  of  RDBs  is  improving  despite  the  high  level  of  nonperforming \nloans. CBSL-prescribed prudential guidelines apply to RDBs.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nRDBs  have  fared  better  than  their  predecessors,  the  RRDBs.  However,  there  is \nsignificant room for improvement in governance, transparency, human resources, and systems \nand procedures. There is no private sector representation on the board of directors to provide \ncommercial expertise or orientation. RDBs need to urgently focus on enhancing portfolio quality \nby reducing the nonperforming loans and acquiring modern technology for credit appraisal and \ndelinquency  management.  Without  reducing  subsidy  dependence  RDBs  will  neither  become \nautonomous  nor  sustainable.  RDBs  have  to  realize  that  the  lower  end  of  the  rural  finance \nmarket provides sufficient avenues for profitable operations and should refrain from diversifying \ninto  market  segments  and  products  for  which  they  are  ill  equipped.  The  Government  has \ndecided  to  divest  80%  of  the  CBSL  stake  in  RDBs  and  facilitate  their  restructuring  under  the \nRural Finance Sector Development Program.  \n\nIssues \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCOOPERATIVE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \n\n \n1. \nSri  Lanka  has  one  of  the  oldest  cooperative  movements  in  the  world,  dating  back  to \n1906. Cooperative societies are governed by the Cooperative Societies Act of 1972. The 10,518 \nprimary cooperatives have a membership of about 5 million and represent a significant political \nconstituency.  Over  8,000  cooperatives  are  engaged  in  savings  and  credit  activities.  Their \nnationwide network provides half of the total annual number of micro loans.1 Cooperative rural \nbanks  (CRBs)  and  thrift  and  credit  cooperative  societies  (TCCSs)2  are  the  two  major \ncooperative systems providing financial services.  \n \nA. \n\nCooperative Rural Banks \n\nOrganization and Governance. The CRBs are the most prominent member-owned and \n2. \nmanaged financial cooperatives, covering urban as well as rural areas. At the end of 2001, 311 \nCRBs had 1,196 branches and 3.9 million members. CRBs demonstrate many  strong features, \nincluding  low-cost  operations,  community  orientation,  rural  culture,  low-risk  loan  products, \nsavings-led financial services, and rural bank-characterized business operations. CRBs are not \nsupervised  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL).  Originally,  the  People's  Bank,  a  state-\nowned commercial  bank,  exercised supervision, provided liquidity support, and managed the \nsurplus (savings over loans) of the CRBs. After the discontinuation of this arrangement in 1992, \nthe CRBs were placed under the management and supervision of the Ministry of Co-operatives, \nwhich does not have adequate capacity to supervise financial institutions. \n \n3. \nMost  CRBs  are  not  independent  legal  entities  but  are  departments  of  multipurpose \ncooperative societies (MPCSs). Such \u201ccaptive\u201d CRBs therefore have no capital of their own and \ncome  under  the  complete  control  of  their  MPCS.  Separate financial accounts to reflect a true \nand fair picture of financial status are not prepared for captive CRBs. Poor accounting and lack \nof  separate  CRB  balance  sheets  increase  depositors'  risk.  In  addition  to  captive  CRBs,  there \nare  five  \u201cfree-standing\u201d  CRBs  (CRBs  that  are  not  departments  of  MPCSs). There are also 14 \ndistrict CRB unions, formed to provide the services formerly provided by the People\u2019s Bank, that \npool  CRB  surpluses  and  invest  them  in  a  variety  of  vehicles  including  loans  to  larger \nnonmember  entities  and  MPCSs.3  The  withdrawal  of  CRB  surpluses  from  the  People\u2019s  Bank \nhas accelerated in recent years due to the weak financial position of the People\u2019s Bank. There \nhave been reports of district CRB unions lending to MPCSs, using the CRB deposit funds. \n \n4. \nIn  addition  to  savings  and  credit  through  the  captive  CRBs,  MPCSs  engage  in  a  wide \nvariety of commercial activities including consumer stores, supermarkets, transport, petrol filling \nstations,  bakeries,  and  rice  mills.  Many  MPCSs  have  experienced  recurring  losses in these \ncommercial  activities,  which  have  eroded  the  value  of  their  equity.  The  surpluses  of  captive \nCRBs, which in some cases are the sole profitable activity of MPCSs, are incorporated into the \ntotal  MPCS  surplus,  leaving  the  CRB  with  inadequate  capital adequacy. Captive CRBs come \nunder  the  control  of  their  MPCS  Board  of  Directors,  and  the  General  Manager  of  the  MPCS \nserves  as  the  chief  executive  officer  of  the  CRB.  Generally,  neither  the  MPCS  Board  nor  the \nMPCS  General  Manager  has  adequate  experience  and  skills  to  operate  a  financial  institution. \nThis  arrangement  compromises  good  governance  and  may  influence  the  lending  decisions  of \nthe  captive  CRBs,  which  are  often  the  primary  financier  of  clients  of  the  commercial  units  of \nMPCSs.  \n                                                 \n1 Loans below SLRs100,000. The aggregate microloan supply in Sri Lanka is estimated at SLRs18.23 billion in 1.65 \n\nmillion accounts. \n\n2 Savings and credit societies organized under farmer organizations are also in the nature of cooperatives.  \n3 Over and above what the attached CRB can provide. \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\nOperations. CRBs can mobilize savings from members and nonmembers, and savings \n5. \nfrom  nonmembers  now  constitute  about  70%  of  total  CRB  deposits  (Table  A3.1).  At  end-\nDecember 2001, CRBs deposits amounted to SLRs16.6 billion in 5.8 million savings accounts, \nmainly  from  rural  areas.  The  average  savings  size  was  SLRs2,860  per  account.  Savings \ncontinue to grow, by 15% during 2001. CRBs can lend only to members. CRB loans are mainly \nfor  housing  and  productive  activities  but  pawning  is  an  increasingly  important  activity.  CRBs \nalso  provide  services  such  as  collection  of  utility  bills  and  payment  of  pensions  to  farmers. \nCollectively, the CRBs disbursed SLRs2.3 billion during 2000. The aggregate outstanding loan \nat end-2001 was SLRs5.9 billion with an average loan size of about SLRs8,500. Loan funds are \nprovided entirely from deposits.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Cooperative Rural Bank Portfolio Performance  \n(SLRs millions) \n \n1997 \n\n1999 \n\n1998 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\nYear \n\n12,914 \n7,232 \n10,996 \n18,228 \n\n9,871 \n5,166 \n9,553 \n14,719 \n\n11,234 \n5,555 \n10,494 \n16,049 \n\nTotal deposits mobilized \nTotal loans and pawning \nTotal investments  \nTotal loans and investments  \nSource: Department of Cooperative Development.  \n \n \nPortfolio  Quality  and  Profitability.  The  Department  of  Cooperative  Development \n6. \n(DCD) reports that 1,174 of the total of 1,507 CRB outlets are profitable. However, this is highly \nunlikely when the overall repayment rate is only 65%. Provisioning that is not based on portfolio \nquality and failure to charge CRB-related MPCS overheads to CRB profitability have inflated the \n\u201cprofits\u201d of CRBs.  In the absence of separate financial statements, CRB profitability is not clear. \nStudy of a sample of captive and free-standing CRBs shows that operational and financial self-\nsufficiency  vary  depending  on  their  status  (Table  A3.2).  The  two  free-standing CRBs achieve \nover 100% financial self-sufficiency and have adequate yield on the loan portfolio. \n\n14,807 \n6,951 \n9,461 \n15,648 \n\n16,576 \n5,906 \n10,520 \n16,426 \n\n \nTable A3. 2: Summary Financial Performance of Sample Cooperative Rural Banks, 2001a \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFree-Standing CRBs  \n\nCaptive CRBs  \n\nSample Cooperative Rural Bank \n\nPolgahawela  Menikhinna \n\nRambewa \n\nAnuradapura \n\nTotal financial revenue (SLRs '000) \n\n25,275 \n\n20,624 \n\nAdjusted administrative costs (SLRs '000) \nLoan-loss provision (SLRs '000) \n\nAdjusted cost of funds (SLRs '000) \n\nNet financial income (SLRs '000) \n\nOperational self-sufficiency (%) \n\nFinancial self-sufficiency (%) \n\n7,734 \n69 \n\n14,434 \n\n3,038 \n\n114 \n\n113 \n\n5,784 \n199 \n\n10,804 \n\n3,837 \n\n123 \n\n111 \n\n560 \n\n477 \n1,198 \n\n330 \n\n28 \n\n27 \n\n922 \n\n826 \n89 \n\n598 \n\n61 \n\n67 \n\n(1,445) \n\n(591) \n\n(120) \n\n15.62 \n\nActual average gross loan portfolio yield \nCRBs = cooperative rural banks. \na As of December. \nSource: Department of Cooperative Development. \n \nIt is estimated that a CRB with a poorly performing loan portfolio may lose as much as \n7. \nSLRs13 for every SLRs100 it lends.

CRBs maintain that their unique system for collecting overdues justifies this. \nLoans without any principal or interest repayments are treated as past due 6 months from the \nfirst  default,  during  which  time  five  repayment  notices  are  issued.  The  Commissioner,  Co-\noperative Development, then refers the loan for arbitration. Failure to settle at this stage gives \nthe  CRB  the  right  to  refer  the  matter  to  the  magistrates  court,  which  is  required  to  act  on  the \naward made at arbitration stage and order it to be collected as a fine due to the state. This gives \nthe order to pay great weight: failure to comply can lead to imprisonment but even this does not \nextinguish the CRB claim. The system appears to work but the administrative machinery is very \nslow, sometimes taking years, and subject to corruption.  \n \n \nIssues. CRBs are probably the only unsubsidized RF network in Sri Lanka. CRBs have \n8. \nbeen  in  existence  for  a  long  time  and  have  survived  without  external  support,  in  some  cases \nsustaining  the  parent  MPCSs,  for  at  least  a  decade.  The  CRB  model  has  several  strong \ncharacteristics that are essential to becoming a viable and sustainable rural finance institution. \nUnfortunately, these strengths are almost nullified by a poor regulatory system, political capture, \npoor administration, very poor accounting standards, and a poor auditing system. Surpluses of \ncaptive  CRBs  have  been  inappropriately  deployed  by  parent  MPCSs.  Significant  amounts  of \nsmall  depositors\u2019  funds  are  at  risk.  CRBs  need  to  operate  as  distinct  financial  entities  with \nautonomy  to  pursue  viable  business  operations.  This  is  only  possible  through  fundamental \nchanges in legal, governance, supervisory, financial, and institutional arrangements.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe primary thrift and credit cooperative societies (TCCSs) were the first cooperatives to \nbe  established  after  the  enactment  of  the  Cooperative  Act  of  1911.  By  1965,  there  were \nreportedly some 4,500 TCCSs. At end-December 2000, the numbers had grown to some 8,500 \nTCCSs with a membership of 905,106, although many are reported to be dormant. TCCSs are \nwidely  spread  throughout  the  country  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  TCCSs  specialize  in \nmicrofinance, providing about 15% of total micro loans. District unions were formed to support \nthe TCCSs and an apex organization, the Federation of Thrift and Credit Cooperatives (FTCC) \nof Sri Lanka was established. However, the FTCC is just a loose network of TCCSs. It has no \ncentral  management  and  does  not  act  either  as  a  supervisor  or  an  effective  coordinator.  As  a \nresult,  the  TCCSs  suffer  from  weak  accounting  and  information  management,  low  efficiency, \nand nonviability. In addition, the systems and procedures are not compatible among  TCCSs at \nthe primary and district levels.  \n \n10. \nSANASA  Development  Bank  (SDB)  was  established  as  a  licensed  specialized  bank  in \n1997  and  is  owned  by  the  TCCSs,  district  unions,  and  the  FTCC.  SDB's  role  is  \u201cto  mobilize \ndeposits  at  competitive  rates  of  interest  and  invest  such  deposits  in  community-based lending \nprograms with particular focus on TCCS, their members, and micro enterprises.\u201d4 SDB is taking \nover  some  of  the  lending  to  TCCS  from  the  FTCC.  As  of  June  2001,  SDB  had  total  loans \noutstanding of SLRs127.5 million. While SDB mainly lends to the district and primary societies, \nit  also  lends  to  microfinance-nongovernment  organizations,  community-based  organizations, \nself-help groups, and individuals who are not society members. \n\nThrift and Credit Cooperative Societies \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Southern  Province  Rural  Economic  Advancement  Project. \nManila. \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41 \n\n \nNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  TRUST FUND \n\nBackground \n\nNational Development Trust Fund Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n118.  The  National  Development  Trust  Fund  (NDTF)  was  established  in  1992  to  manage  a \nPoverty Alleviation Project, including a credit fund for lending to partner rural finance institutions \n(RFIs) to onlend to the poor, a human resources development fund, a rural works fund, and a \nnutrition fund. The Poverty Alleviation Project was funded by the World Bank, Kreditanstalt f?r \nWiederaufbau,  and  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka.  While  NDTF's  noncredit  operations were \nwound up in 1998, it continues as a wholesale lender to RFIs. At end-2001, NDTF had a loan \nportfolio  of  SLRs373.9  million  net  of  provisions  of  SLRs135.8  million.  In  addition,  SLRs700.8 \nmillion  are  invested  in  government  securities  and  fixed  deposits.  NDTF  is  governed  by  a  15-\nmember Board of Trustees, selected by the Government and comprising nine public sector and \nsix private sector representatives.  \n \nB. \n \n119.  NDTF's performance, outreach, and impact on  the microfinance (MF) sector have been \nlimited  compared  with  its  resources  and  market  potential.  Concerns  center  on  its  scale  of \noperations,  loan  portfolio  management,  selection  and  support  of  partner  RFIs,  and  weak \ninstitutional  capacity.  NDTF  disbursed  SLRs337.6  million  in  loans  in  2001  to  partner  RFIs \nincluding microfinance nongovernment organizations (MF-NGOs), cooperative rural banks, thrift \nand  credit  cooperative  societies,  regional  development  banks,  and  other  banks.  As  of  June \n2002,  NDTF  had  160  partner  RFIs,  of  which  81  were  active  borrowers  with  outstanding  loans \ntotaling SLRs597.1 million. Of this, SLRs127.9 million (21.4%) was considered doubtful, mostly \nmade up of long-standing overdues with thrift and credit cooperative societies, cooperative rural \nbanks,  and  MF-NGOs.  Most  of  these  are  probably  unrecoverable.  The  financial  viability  of \nNDTF is weak. Partner RFIs often repay loans from new NDTF borrowings because of the low \ncost  of  NDTF  funds.  The  interest  spread  is  estimated  to  cover  only  30%  of NDTF\u2019s operating \ncosts excluding overhead charges.  \n \n120.  The  present  legal  status  of  NDTF  as  a  trust  does  not  permit  a  legally  binding  lender-\nborrower relationship with its partner RFIs. While NDTF remains the main wholesale lender to \nMF-NGOs, providing loans to 60 of them in 2001, lending to MF-NGOs constituted only 26% of \ntotal  lending  in  that  year.  Partner  RFIs  include  commercial  banks  that  have  access  to  other \nsources  of  funds.  Further,  NDTF  has  not  provided  any  significant  capacity-building  support to \nMF-NGOs or encouraged their adoption of best practices, either through direct assistance or by \nusing  its  position  as  a  lender  to  exert  influence.  NDTF  does  not  have  sufficient  staff  with \ntechnical and managerial skills for effectively implementing its program.  \n \nC. \n \n121.  As  part  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program,  NDTF  has  been \nincorporated under the Companies Act No.17 of 1982 to provide it with a proper legal basis to \nact  as  a  lending  institution.  Institutional  strengthening  support  will  be  provided  to  transform \nNDTF into a viable MF apex organization capable of acting as a focal point for development of \nthe  MF  sector  with  the  goal  of  rapidly  expanding  outreach,  particularly  in  the  conflict-affected \nareas, and guiding MF-NGOs towards financial sustainability. \n\nInstitutional Reform \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nSAMURDHI PROGRAM AND SAMURDHI BANKING SOCIETIES \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Samurdhi  Program,  the  main  poverty  reduction  scheme  of  the  Government  of  Sri \n1. \nLanka  has  operated  since  1995.  The  program  includes  income  transfer  (welfare  grant)  and \ncommunity-based rural infrastructure development components. The Samurdhi Banking Society \n(SBS)  Program  was  introduced  in  March  1997  as  part  of  the  Samurdhi  Program  to  promote \nsavings and investment in rural areas. The SBS Program is operated by the Samurdhi Authority \nof Sri Lanka under the purview of the Ministry of Samurdhi, Agriculture and Livestock.  \n\n2. \nThe SBS Program is based on the concept of group collateral and collective savings of \nfive-member  groups,  the  great  majority of whom receive Samurdhi welfare grants. Successful \ngroups join together to form autonomous village-level societies\u2014SBSs\u2014which are managed by \nSamurdhi  managers  and  supervised  by  divisional  secretaries  of  the  Government.  Each  SBS \nmember purchases SLRs500 worth of shares to become eligible to borrow. With over 1.7 million \nmembers  in  2002,  the  SBS  Program  is  the  largest  microfinance  institution  (MFI) in Sri Lanka \nand one of the largest in the world. Over 60% of shareholders are female. \n\nSamurdhi Banking Society Performance \n\nB. \n \n3. \nThe  SBS  Program  has  achieved  tremendous  growth  in  terms  of  membership,  savings \nmobilization, and credit disbursement, with high repayment rates. As of June 2002, there were \n989  SBSs  operating  in  286  divisional  secretariats  and  a  further  8  SBSs  will  be  opened  soon. \nThere  were  3.5  million  savings  accounts,  including  compulsory  deposits  of  Samurdhi \nbeneficiaries. Total deposits at mid-year 2002 amounted to SLRs6.7 billion, an increase of over \n300%  since  2000.  The  value  of  paid-up capital  amounted  to  SLRs1.5  billion,  an  increase  of \nSLRs120 million relative to the previous year. The total value of loans issued from inception by \nSBSs totals SLRs5.5 billion and of this, half was issued in 2001 alone, making the SBS Program \nthe fastest growing loan program in Sri Lanka. Outstanding loans of SBS at end-2001 amounted \nto  SLRs2.3  billion  with  429,231  active  loans.  The  on-time  loan  recovery  rate  as  of  June  2002 \nwas  reported  as  93.4%,  which  is  the  best  recovery  ratio  among  MFIs  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  high \nrepayment rate is mainly due to the large number of Samurdhi development officers employed \nin the field as well as the system that pays welfare grants through SBSs, putting SBS managers \nin a good position to ensure repayment. \n \nHowever, the SBS operation is very expensive. The operational cost,1 excluding the cost \n4. \nof  funds,  of  an  average  performing  SBS  in  2001  was  approximately  73%  of  its  average  gross \nloans  outstanding,  significantly  higher  than  typical  successful  MFIs  in  the  region.2  No  SBS \nattained  100%  financial  self-sufficiency. 3  The  financial  self-sufficiency  of  the  best  performing \nSBS  was  estimated  at  78.7%,  while  that  of  the  average  performing  SBSs  was  38.5%  (Table \nA5). As the majority of SBS costs are borne by the Government, and with the current  staff and \noperational  cost  level,  most  SBSs  are  expected  to  be  unsustainable  over  the  long  run.  It  is \n                                                 \n1   Including allocation of 75% of the salary and allowances of government staff assigned to the SBS. The Samurdhi \nAuthority of Sri Lanka argues that the government staff working for SBSs also contribute to other components of \nthe Samurdhi Program (welfare grants, insurance, community infrastructure) and therefore only a small part of the \ncost  of  such  personnel  should  be  allocated  to  SBSs.  However,  even  after  allocation  of  a  lower  proportion  of \ngovernment staff costs, the SBSs remain very high cost MFIs. \n\n2  The ratio in other MFIs of similar size in Bangladesh is 5% for the Association for Social Advancement, 8% for the \n\nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and 9% for the Grameen Bank. \n\n3   According to the definition by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest, financial self-sufficiency = total financial \nrevenue/total operational cost - donations and all subsidies including subsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nestimated  that  SBSs  as  a  whole  have  at  least  60%  excess  staff  and  about  99%  of  SBSs  are \ncurrently unprofitable. Restructuring measures such as further cost reductions, expanded loan \nand  saving  activities,  and  efficiency  and  productivity  improvements  are  necessary  for  the \nmajority of SBSs to achieve financial sustainability. \n \n\nTable A5: Summary Operational Efficiency Performance of a Selected Representative \nSample of Samurdhi Banking Societiesa \n\n \nItem \n\nBest \nPerforming \nRakwana \n20.48 \n37.29 \n0.78 \n9.35 \n(26.94) \n94.56 \n78.73 \n\nTop 20% \n\nAverage \nPerforming \nPolgahawela \n\nPoorly \nPerforming \nWariyapola \n\n24.96 \n81.09 \n7.56 \n9.35 \n(73.04) \n32.93 \n30.69 \n\n26.21 \n72.88 \n0.77 \n9.35 \n(56.79) \n42.70 \n38.45 \n\nDambulla \n24.26 \n57.72 \n6.13 \n9.35 \n(48.94) \n73.37 \n65.59 \n\nSamurdhi Banking Society \nFinancial Revenue from Loan Portfolio (SLRs) \nAdjusted Administrative Costs (SLRs) \nLoan Loss (provision) (SLRs) \nEstimated Cost of Funds (SLRs) \nNet Financial Income (SLRs) \nOperational Self-sufficiency (%) \nFinancial Self-sufficiency (%) \na Per 100 units of gross loan portfolio outstanding. \nSources: ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Preparing Rural Finance Sector Development Project. \nManila. \n \n122.  The Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka does not produce separate audited accounts for its \nbanking  and  financial  activities  and  the  SBS  accounts  are  not  consolidated.  SBSs  depend  on \nthe Divisional Secretary Office to prepare their final accounts and conduct the annual audit. A \nlarge number of SBS accounts are not audited. The allocation of government-subsidized costs \nis not included in individual SBS accounts. SBS operating surpluses appear to be appropriated \nfor various cost centers within the Government, which would impair the ability of an SBS to build \na sound equity base for its independent operation. Further, SBSs are not under the supervision \nof any independent supervisor. \n \nC. \n\nProposed Institutional Reform \n\n123.  Broad-based  institutional  reforms  are  needed to transform SBSs into autonomous and \nviable financial institutions to play a significant role in rural poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. SBSs \nneed to move toward operational self-sufficiency by fundamentally restructuring their operations. \nWithin  the  scope  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program,  portfolio  analysis  and \ndiagnostic  reviews  were  undertaken  with  the  objective  of  developing  an  SBS  Institutional \nStrengthening  Plan  to  strengthen  SBSs'  institutional  capabilities  as  viable  rural  finance \ninstitutions  and  poverty  reduction  instruments  to  achieve  greater  cost-effectiveness  and \noperational  sufficiency.  The  portfolio  analysis  covers  the  performance  analysis  of  loan,  equity, \nand  liquid  asset  portfolios  of  selected  SBSs  and  the  impact  of  portfolio  quality  on  overall \nfinancial  condition  and  performance.  The  diagnostic  review  analyzes  SBSs\u2019  organization, \nmanagement,  operations,  credit  policies,  and  related  processes.  The  SBS  Institutional \nStrengthening  Plan  incorporating  the  outputs  of  portfolio  analysis  and  diagnostic  reviews  will \ncover  improvement  of  governance,  operational  standards  including  accounting  and  auditing, \nfinancial viability, and outreach.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n44\n\nAppendix 6 \n\nMICROFINANCE-NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS \n\n \n1. \nThere  are  about  200  microfinance-nongovernment  organizations  (MF-NGOs)  in  Sri \nLanka, of which four are large entities and the rest are small multisector NGOs. Many of the MF-\nNGOs  apply  an  \u201cMF-plus\u201d  approach  whereby  borrowers  are  supported  by  other  services, \nprimarily training and business development services. As a result, MF-NGOs are not focused on \nsustainable  provision  of  financial  services  and  their  financial  intermediation  skills  are  weak, \nespecially in accounting and loan analysis. A brief description of the large MF-NGOs follows. \n \n2. \nSarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Service  (SEEDS).  SEEDS  is  a \nregistered  company  limited  by  guarantee,  established  in  1986  by  Sarvodaya  Shramadana \nSangamaya  Movement  (Sarvodaya),  an  NGO  started  in  1958  to  empower  villages  through \nstrengthening their capacity to develop enterprises. Through its head office in Colombo and 11 \ndistrict  offices,  SEEDS  serves  as  a  wholesale  lender  to  Sarvodaya  village  societies  and \nSarvodaya  village  banks  that  onlend  to  their  members.  As  part  of  its  \u201cMF-plus\u201d  approach, \nSEEDS also provides training, monitoring, supervision, and enterprise development support to \nSarvodaya  societies  and  banks.  As  of  March  2001,  the  SEEDS  network  had  177,974  loan \nclients  with  an  outstanding  portfolio  of  SLRs667  million,  and  SLRs358  million  in  savings  in \n662,272 savings accounts. Women constitute 60% of clients.  \n \nThe operational and financial self-sufficiency1 of SEEDS at end-2001 was 72% and 55%, \n3. \nrespectively.  While  the  repayment  rate  is  94%,  18.5%  of  loans  to  Sarvodaya  societies  and \nbanks are delinquent, of which about 76% are over 12 months in arrears. The overall portfolio \nquality  of  the  network  could  be  weaker  still,  as  Sarvodaya  societies  and  banks  have  weak \nfinancial management, supervision, and control systems. Their financial viability is also in doubt. \nThe  SEEDS  network  requires  substantial  improvements  in  supervision,  credit  appraisal,  and \ndelinquency management.  \n \nJanashakthi.  As  an  offshoot  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  poverty  reduction \n4. \nprogram,  Janashakthi  began  operations  as  a  member-based  MF-NGO  in  1989.  Janashakthi \nsocieties  organized  themselves  into  Janashakthi  bank  societies  (JBSs)  to  pool  individual  and \ngroup  savings  and  extend  small  loans.  There  are  67  JBSs  with  a  total  membership  of  28,168 \nwith  about  5,300  groups  of  five  women  each.  The  target  market  is  families  earning  less  than \nSLRs1,500  per  month.  At  village  level,  the  groups  meet  weekly  with  individuals  contributing \nSLRs25 each time. In addition, each group member must subscribe SLRs500 in the capital of \nJBS. Savings and loans outstanding at end-December 2001 were SLRs29 million and SLRs91 \nmillion,  respectively.  Loan  repayment  rates  average  around  97%.  The  consolidated  surplus  of \nall  JBSs  was  SLRs0.8  million  at  end-December  2001  or  an  average  of  SLRs11,370  per  JBS. \nWhile  most  JBSs  are  profitable,  expansion  is  affected  by  lack  of  funds  for  supporting  its \nmultidimensional  approach  to  poverty  reduction  covering  health,  nutrition,  environment,  and \nbanking. \n \n5. \nSocial  Mobilization  Foundation  is  the  banking  arm  of  the  Government\u2019s  Integrated \nRural Development Project. It has around 10,000 clients with a revolving fund of SLRs20 million.  \n \n6. \nArthachariya Foundation. Founded in 1992, the Arthachariya Foundation has a strong \npoverty  focus,  working  only  with  the  poorest  in  the  villages.  It  has  a  revolving  fund  of \napproximately SLRs20 million and a client base of around 3,000.  \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poorest  defines  financial  self-sufficiency  as  total  financial  revenue/total \n\noperational cost - donations and all subsidies including subsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nRural Development \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nInfrastructure, community development, \nsocial capital, and some rural finance \n(RF).  \n\u2022  Southern Province Rural Economic \nAdvancement Project ($25 million) \n\u2022  North East Community Restoration \n\nand Development Project \n($25 million) \n\n\u2022  North Central Province Rural \n\nDevelopment Project ($20 million) \n\n\u2022  Southern Province Rural \n\nDevelopment Project ($38 million) \n\n \nWorld Bank  \n\nImprovement, better operation, and \nmaintenance of irrigation facilities. \n\u2022  Mahaweli Restructuring and \nRehabilitation Project \n\nEXTERNAL AGENCY COORDINATION MATRIXa   \nAgriculture  \n\nMicrofinance \n\nFinancial Sector \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nInvestments in tea, rubber, \ncoconuts and other perennial \ncrops, factory consolidation, \nmarketing, research support, and \nintegrated farming system. \n\n\u2022  Second Agriculture Program \n\n($60 million) \n\n\u2022  Plantation Development \n\n\u2022  Plantation Reform Program \n\n($20 million) \n\n($60 million) \n\n\u2022  Second Perennial Crops \n\nDevelopment Project ($20 \nmillion) \n\n\u2022  Tea Development Project \n\n($35 million) \n\n \nWorld Bank  \n\u2022 \n\nOthers  \nMicrofinance services for \nsmall farmers and \nlandless poor, and review \nof existing financial \ninstitutions. \n\u2022  Rural Banking \n\nInnovations Project \n(Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische \nZusammenarbeit \n(GTZ)) \n\n\u2022  Small Farmers and \nLandless Credit \nProject (IFAD) \n\u2022  Poverty Alleviation \n\nMicrofinance Project \n(JBIC) \n\n\u2022 \n\nAsian Development Bank \nDeveloping financial \ninstitutions  \n\u2022 \n\nFourth Development \nFinance Project ($75 \nmillion) \n\nWorld Bank \nInstitutional Strengthening of \nthe Central Bank of Sri \nLanka, fiscal stabilization, \nimprovement of the state-\nowned financial institutions, \nand diversifying savings \ninstruments. \n\u2022  Central Bank of Sri \n\nLanka Strengthening \nProject \nFinancial Sector \nReforms Program  \n\nSmall and Medium \nEnterprises  \nAsian Development Bank \nRegulatory reform and \nstrengthening of small and \nmedium enterprise \ncapacities. \n\u2022  Small and Medium \nEnterprise Sector \nDevelopm ent \nProgram ($26 million) \n\n \n\n \n\nIFAD, JBIC, and UNDP \n\n\u2022  Others \n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  North-East Irrigated \nAgriculture Project \n\nImproved agricultural \nproduction in conflict-affected \nareas . \n\n \nOthers  \nInternational Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD);

The objective of the RFSDP \nis to establish a sustainable RF system through policy adjustments to eliminate structural constraints to growth of the RF sector and to improve the operations of RF \ninstitutions (RFIs). Institutionalizing policies that emphasize good governance will yield considerable benefits in terms of fostering a long-term sector wide \nperspective for sustainability. The investments in RF sector will generate adequate returns in terms of rural growth and value addition in the rural sector. To achieve \nthis, the Government of Sri Lanka will initiate actions relating to: (i) conducive policies, (ii) supportive legal and regulatory framework, (iii) institutional reforms for \nsustainability, (iv) strengthening the demand side, and (v) expansion of RF in conflict-affected areas. \n\nConducive Policies  \n\n(i)  \nAdopt a conducive \npolicy framework \nfor RF sector \ndevelopment.  \n\nCritical policy issues have \nto be addressed to \ndevelop a sustainable RF \nsector.

To utilize financial \n1. \nservices  effectively,  productive  activities  must  allow  microentrepreneurs  to  generate  sufficient \nreturns to remain viable in the medium to long term. This requires an environment that permits \nand  encourages  microentrepreneurs  to  take  benefit  from  market  opportunities, and facilitates \ntheir continuous access to critical support services. Microenterprises in rural areas face serious \nconstraints,  including  inadequate  physical  infrastructure  such  as  electricity  and  roads,  lack  of \nbusiness support including research  and  development  and  business  advisory  services,  and  a \nlow  skill  base.  Private  sector  microenterprise  development  can  be  better  realized  by  removing \nthese constraints while providing effective linkages to rural finance (RF) services.  \n \nB. \n \nThe Government\u2019s Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF), established to address \n2. \nrural  social  and  economic  constraints  through  small  community-based  investments,  cannot \nrealize  its  potential  due  to  inadequate  resources.  The  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development \nProgram  (RFSDP)  will  support  refocusing  and  enhancement  of  RERF  for  financing  rural \ncommunity-based  investment  projects  with  linkages  to  RF  services.  Strategic  investments  in \nskills  development,  marketing  networks,  infrastructure  for  improved  distribution,  and marketing \nof rural products to achieve better prices and community infrastructure such as storage facilities, \nsmall-scale  irrigation,  and  farmer  information  centers  will  catalyze  social  preparation  and \nentrepreneurial  activity.  Links  to  RF  services  will  enhance  the  ability  of  rural  communities  to \nbenefit from market opportunities.  \n \n3. \nThe  RERF  aims  to  support  demand  side  development  for  the  growth  of  the  RF  sector. \nThe objective of the RERF is, by providing support for community development, to develop the \ncapability of the poor to make efficient use of RF services for their income generating activities. \nRERF  projects  will  be  initiated,  identified,  designed,  and  implemented  by  rural  communities  in \ncollaboration with service providers including nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  RERF  will  be  administered  by  the  RERF  Trust.  The  RERF  Trust  is  chaired  by  the \nDirector  General  of  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Economy  (MRE)  and  administered  by  the  trustees, \nconsisting  of  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  private  sector  including \nNGOs.  The  trustees  are  appointed  by  the  Minister  of  Rural  Economy.  The  trustees  are \nresponsible,  among  others,  for  ensuring  that  the  RERF  is  utilized  for  the  purpose  of  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  enhancement  of  rural  communities,  and  approving  investment  and \noperational decisions arranged or recommended by the RERF Secretariat (the Secretariat).  \n \n5. \nThe administration and management of the RERF will be supported by the Secretariat, \nwhich  consists  of  a  chief  executive  officer,  an  engineer  as  a  rural  community  infrastructure \nspecialist,  and  a  gender  and  social  development  specialist.  The  Secretariat,  with  delegated \nauthority  of  the  trustees,  will  process  rural  community  investment  proposals for RERF funding \nand  other  investment  tasks  for  the  approval  by  the  trustees.  The  overall  functions  of  the \nSecretariat  will  be  (i) managing  the  RERF  capital  and  facilitating  its  appropriate  investment, \n(ii) processing  the  RERF  for  community  investment  projects,  and  (iii) providing  administrative \nsupport  for  the  trustees  and  other  stakeholders  for  smooth  operation  of  the  RERF.  All  the \n\nManagement and Finance  \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nOperations  \n\nSecretariat staff will be recruited in the open market for a fixed term that can be extended for a \nfurther  fixed  term.  The  total  annual  expenditure  for  management  and  administration  of  the \nRERF will not exceed 5% of the amounts credited to the RERF account.  \n \nThe  capital  of  the  RERF  will  be  provided  by  the  Government.  The  Government  will \n6. \ncontribute proceeds of the RFSDP program loan equivalent to $10 million to enhance the RERF \ncapital.  RFSDP  contribution  to  RERF  will  be  invested  by  the  Government  in  approved \ngovernment  securities  to  avoid  any  speculative  investments  and  to  ensure  due  and  careful \nconsideration  of  project  applications.  The  interest  revenue  generated  will  be  transferred  into  a \ndesignated  income  account  with  the  Trust  to  be  expensed  out  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the \nRERF.  The  Secretariat  will  manage  the  income  accounts.  All  payments  will  be  based  on \ninvoices and  credited  to  the  account  of  service  providers  after  documentary  evidence  that  the \ninvestment  has  been  completed  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  community.  RERF  investments  for \ncommunities  will  be  grants  for  community  development  and  social  intermediation.  However, \nrecipient  communities  are  required  to  contribute  at  least  10%  of  the  total  investment  amount, \nprimarily  in  kind  such  as  material  or  labor  contribution,  or  in  cash  whenever  appropriate, \nespecially when projects require relatively high capital inputs. \n \nD. \n \nGiven the need for investment in rural communities and the relatively limited resources \n7. \navailable,  investments  funded  by  the  RERF  must  be  carefully  selected  to  ensure  they  have \ngreater potential to benefit a large proportion of the households in the community. The proposed \ncommunity investment projects should meet the objectives of (i) increasing the access of poor \ncommunities  of  disadvantaged  areas  to  basic  infrastructure  facilities;  (ii) enhancing efficiency \nand  productivity  of  the  local  resource  pool;  (iii) creating  income-earning  opportunities  for  the \npoor households; and (iv) empowering the poor, especially women.  \n \nRERF grant funding for rural community investment projects using RFSDP resources will \n8. \nbe limited to $3,000 equivalent, to  ensure that resources are channeled to small and medium-\nscale  projects  for  meeting  the  immediate  needs  of  the  rural  poor.  Requests  for  funding \nexceeding $3,000 can be approved by the trustees on review of justification up to a maximum of \n$5,000  per  project.  For  projects  above  this  ceiling,  resources  from  other  sources  can \nsupplement RERF funding and community contribution. \n \n9. \nFor  investments  funded  by  RERF,  communities  will  be  the  primary  entities  to  identify \ntheir  needs,  priorities,  and  required  interventions. Communities will develop their projects with \nassistance  from  service  providers  and  enter  into  partnership  agreement  with  the  RERF  Trust \nspecifying detailed project design, budget, financing plan including community contribution, and \noperation  and  maintenance  arrangements.  RERF  funding  will  be  based  on  project  proposals \nprepared  by  communities  including  a  feasibility  report,  village  profile,  and  initial  environmental \nassessment.  Upon  review  and  approval  by  the  trustees,  the  communities  will  open  a  bank \naccount to be operated by the community representatives including one woman, to receive the \nRERF grant installments and to expense out the project-related expenses.  \n \n10. \nIt is expected that RERF resources will fund 850 community projects by end-2007, and \nthereafter 275 per year. The investment arrangements of RERF enable it to finance community \ninvestment projects amounting to SLR800 million by 2015. The funding projection with indicative \nprojects is attached (Table A10). \n\n  \n\n\f6\n1\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n\ni\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nA10.1.

YES \n \nAsian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  medium -term \ndevelopment  goals  for  Sri  Lanka  stipulate  that  a  high \npriority  is  accorded  to  broad-based  rural  development \nthrough  increasing  productivity  of  the  poor,  developing \ninfrastructure  especially  in  rural  and  remote  areas, \nincreasing access to financial and business services, and \nproviding  a  stable  and  sustainable  macroeconomic \nenvironment.  Further,  the  medium -term  goals  address \nconflict-related  poverty  by  providing  rehabilitation  and \nrecons truction  assistance  to  the  conflict-affected areas \ntargeting employment generation. \n\nSector identified as a national priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis? YES \n \nIn its Framework for Poverty Reduction, the Government \nof Sri Lanka (Government) addressed its policy to reduce \ninfrastructure \npoverty \ndevelopment and developing a sustainable financial and \nancillary  service  environment  for  the  private  sector  to \nexpand  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  participate  in \neconomic \npro-poor \ntransformation  in  agriculture  by  using  intensified  policy \ndialogue  to  advocate  adoption  of  more  market-oriented \npolicies. \n \nContribution of the sector/sub sector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nIn Sri Lanka, almost 40% of the population is estimated to be either poor or vulnerable to poverty, and roughly 88% of \nthe poor live in rural areas. Farmers with few nonfarm sources of income, cultivating small plots of land, and casual \nworkers  account  for  a  large  share  of  the  poor.  Rural  poverty  is  also  due  to  inequitable  access  to  economic \ninfrastructure,  poorly  targeted  agriculture  subsidies,  weak  land  tenure  and  registration  system,  and  inadequate \nsupport for rural enterprise development. The development of a sustainable rural finance (RF) sector and efficient RF \ninstitutions (RFIs) will help promote  rural  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  through  (i) increased productivity \nand  profitability  of  rural  economic  activities  through  high  value  crops  and  improved  manufacturing  technology; \n(ii) higher employment generation; and (iii) private sector development, especially micro and small enterprises. \n \nB. \n\nImproved Governance/Gender & Development  \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nDespite a nationwide network of a wide range of RFIs, the supply gap in rural credit is estimated at SLRs10 billion. \nHalf  of  this  relates  to  rural  poor.  The  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  (RFSDP)  will  aim  to  effectively \nmeet  the  demand  for  RF  services  emanating  from  the  rural  poor  and  the  vulnerable.  Thus,  the  key  focus  of  the \npoverty  analysis  is  (i) poverty assessment and mapping of the poor and vulnerable who are unable to access RF \nservices, (ii) stocktaking of tangible and intangible productive assets of the poor and vulnerable for making effective \nuse of access to RF for income generating activities, and (iii) identifying constraints to enhancing RF outreach. \n \nPoverty  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  benefits  of  the  economic  growth  of  about  5%  over  the  past  2  decades  are  not  evenly \ndistributed. While the level of consumption poverty in all the provinces exceeds 20%, it is 40% and above in all but \nthe Western Province. In the north and the east, economic activity has been disrupted due to the civil conflict, causing \na decline in the contribution of this region to national gross domestic product from 15% in the 1980s to 4% in 1997. \n \nPoverty  and  the  Civil  Conflict.  The  civil  conflict  that  has  lasted  for  over  a  decade  has  resulted  in  at  least  60,000 \ndeaths,  injured,  and  internally  displaced  people.  Physical  assets,  including  homes,  schools,  shops,  vehicles,  and \nmachinery have been abandoned and public infrastructure has virtually collapsed. Social services function with great \ndifficulty,  and  there  is  limited  access  to  shelter,  health,  education,  water,  and  sanitation.  The  conflict  caused \nwidespread prevalence of underweight among children, as high as 50%; and physical injury and psychological stress. \nIt is estimated that the conflict has reduced Sri Lanka's economic growth by about 2\u20133% a year.1 \n \nPoverty  and  the  Agriculture  Sector. The stagnant agriculture sector and  low  productivity  per  capita  also  lead  to \npersistence rural poverty. Agriculture accounts for roughly 40% of the workforce and produces only 18% of GDP. The \nsingle  most  important  impediment  to  agricultural  prosperity  is  a  policy  regime  that  substitutes  cons ultation and \nparticipation in decision making with administrative control. State ownership of some 80% of the land, restriction on \nland  allocation,  pervasive  input  and  credit  subsidies,  and  frequent  changes  in  agricultural  trade  policies  result  in \ninefficient use of resources and restrict access to improved agro-technology, especially seeds and planting materials. \nPaddy farmers and landless laborers employed in the paddy sector comprise a large share of the rural poor. There is \n                                                 \n1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 1999. Annual Report. Colombo. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n69\n\nParticipation Process \n\nPaddy farmers and landless laborers employed in the paddy sector comprise a large share of the rural poor. There is \nconsiderable  evidence  to  show  that  returns  to  labor,  land,  and  management  in  paddy  cultivation  have  been \ndecreasing  in  real  terms  since  the  mid-1980s.  Parallel  development  of  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  is  necessary  for \nabsorbing the surplus labor from agriculture, thereby relieving pressure on agricultural holdings. \n \nRural Poverty and the Policy. The Government initiated various welfare programs such as the Samurdhi Program, \nwhich combines income transfers, small-scale capital projects, and development of savings and credit societies. The \ngovernment  welfare  programs,  however,  ineffectively  targeted  relief  payments  and  various  kinds  of  subsidies,  and \nallowed the farmers only a limited title to the government land. The current welfare programs of the Government are \nunsustainable, subject to political interference, and encourage dependence. Poor payment records among most RFIs \nare  the  result  of  ill-conceived development programs and political interventions. There is a growing consensus that \nrural  poverty  would  be  reduced  more  rapidly  by  replacing  welfare-oriented  policies  with  policies  conducive  to \nstructural changes and the encouragement of market forces. \n \nRural  Poverty  and  the  Nonfarm  Subsector.  Many  rural  households  among  the  lower  poor  are  unable  to  benefit \nfrom RF because they cannot bear the risk of failure of their micro enterprises. People at this income level will derive \nthe  greatest  benefit  from  the  rural  sector  growth  that  increases  farm  and  nonfarm  employment  opportunities.  In  Sri \nLanka rural people with land do not have secure title, and most landholdings are nontradable. This places the poor at \na disadvantage in accessing rural credit for expansion and diversification of their livelihoods. There is a clear need for \nan  accelerated  land  reform,  and  for  alternatives  to  collateral-based  lending.  Commercial  banks  are  seen  as \ninaccessible or unresponsive to the needs of small and micro rural enterprises, especially for small agriculture-based \nenterprises,  when  compared  to  RFIs,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  government-sponsored  rural credit \nprograms, or community-based organizations or informal sources such as moneylenders and pawnbrokers. \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis prepared                   YES \nStakeholder Analysis. RFSDP will involve participation of stakeholders at different levels and from different sectors. \nBeing the direct focus, marginal and subsistence farmers, women and the rural poor will be active participants. Rural \nfarm and nonfarm households currently being served by RFIs will continue to have access to RF services and hence \nremain  active  participants.  The  restructuring  of  RFIs  (Cooperative  Rural  Banks,  Regional  Development  Banks, \nSamurdhi  Banking  Societies,  and  National  Development  Trust  Fund)  will  further  extend  their  outreach  covering \nadditional  rural  poor  in  remote  areas  as  well  as  the  poorest  who  have  been  unable  to  access  RF  from  commercial \nbanks and other institutional sources. The proposed Rural Finance Sector Development Act for regulation of RFIs will \nens ure  secured  financial  services  and  deposit  protection.  At  the  Government  level,  Ministry  of  Policy  Development \nand Implementation, Ministry of Rural Economy, Ministry of Co-operatives, Ministry of Samurdhi and the Central Bank \nof  Sri  Lanka  will  be  involved  in  RFSDP  implementation.  In  addition,  the  proposed  policy  and  investment  options \ninclude a special support package for extension of RF services in the north and the east, hence requiring participation \nby various Ministries, funding-agencies, NGOs, and civil society. Through RFI restructuring and outreach expansion \nthrough  rural  enterprise  development,  significant  private  sector  participation  and  development  are  expected.  Also, \nextension of the formal credit services to rural areas will curb usury practices . NGOs and civil society will be active \nparticipants in planning and implementation of the Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF). Social intermediation \nthrough RERF will enhance the capacity of the poor to effectively utilize the increased access to RF services.   \n \nParticipation  Strategy.  During  implementation,  the  proposed  policy  and  investment  interventions  will  follow  an \nintegrated  participatory  approach.  Involvement  of  stakeholders  from  various  levels  and  sectors  will  ensure  that  the \napproach is adhered to through methods such as participatory stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions, and \nrapid appraisal. The social assessment will emphasize participatory process of direct beneficiaries and lower-end RF \nservice  providers  to  assess  their  needs  and  formulate  effective  outreach  mechanisms  and  identify  monitoring  and \nevaluation  indicators.  The  assessments  will  also  involve  consultations  with  (i) women  groups  to  identify  gender \nrelated issues, (ii) the poorest and vulnerable such as female-headed households to assess their special needs, and \n(iii) households in geographically remote areas where rural poverty is most acute. Monitoring and evaluation will be \ncarried out in a participatory manner with a set of indicators measurable by beneficiaries and stakeholders. \n \nD. \n \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  social  analysis  includes  gender  analysis  to  identify  issues  and \nconstraints for women to take and utilize RF services. A strategy of social intermediation will be prepared to assess \ntraining and skill development needs for women. \n \n\nGender and Development \n\nParticipation Strategy            YES \n\n \n\n\fGender plan prepared?

There  will  be  positive  impacts  on \nresettlement due to improved productivity in agricultural sector \nas  well  as  greater  employment  and  more  diversified \nemployment opportunities in the rural economy.  \nThere  will  be  no  affordability-related  issues.  In  contrast, \nreduced  dependence  on  very  expensive  informal  sources  of \ncredit  will  not  only  reduce  the  price  of  inputs,  cost  of \nproduction, but will also ensure that rural households are able \nto  get  better  price  for  their  produce.  The  reduced  cost  of \nproduction along with productivity improvements will result in a \ncompetitive  rural  sector  that  will  not  be  dependent  on \nGovernment subsidies and welfare programs. \nEnhanced  outreach  as  a  result  of  RFI  restructuring  will \nincrease \nto  greater \nemployment opportunities. Community support and expansion \nof RF services in the conflict-affected areas will rebuild social \nand  economic  infrastructure,  revive  economic  sectors,  and \ngenerate  significant  employment  opportunities.  Further,  the \nrural enterprise development credit line support for rural small \nand micro enterprises will increase employment opportunities \nin both agriculture and agriculture-related sectors. \nNo  adverse  issues  related  to  the  indigenous  people  are \nanticipated. \nNo other adverse issues are anticipated. \n\nrural  economic  activities \n\nleading \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy \n\nStrategy and Target \n\n\u2022  Gender awareness training for promoting gender balanced client outreach. \n\u2022  Encourage RFIs to formulate business plans with quantifiable gender outreach targets.  \n\u2022  Community  investment  planning  process  will  include  need  assessment  of  female \n\n\u2022 \n\ncommunity members. \nFemale  community  members  will  participate  in  design  and  construction  planning  of \ncommunity-based infrastructure. \n\n\u2022  Gender awareness training for RFIs to expand outreach to female clients. \n\u2022  Encourage RFIs to formulate business plans with quantifiable gender outreach targets.  \n\u2022  Encourage microfinance-NGOs to hire female staff.  \n\u2022  RERF will provide social intermediation, specifically aimed at potential female clients. \n\u2022 \n\n75% of the credit line for rural enterprise development is targeted at female clients of RFIs.  \n\n\u2022 \n\nThe baseline survey to be undertaken at the start of RFSDP, repeated at midterm and at \nproject completion will be gender-disaggregated and include gender impact indicators.  \n\u2022  Staff  at  the  project  management  unit  and  project  implementation  units  will  be  provided \n\ngender awareness training for project monitoring and evaluation. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["For the purpose of calculations in this report, the rate of $1.00 = SLRs97 has been used. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \nSLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs)  \n$0.0106 \nSLRs94.50 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCenter for Banking Studies  \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka  \ncooperative rural bank  \nExecuting Agency \nimplementing agency \ninformation technology  \nLondon interbank offer rate  \nmicrofinance-nongovernment organization \nmanagement information system  \nMinistry of Co-operatives  \nMinistry of Policy Development and Implementation  \nMinistry of Rural Economy  \nNational Development Trust Fund  \nnongovernment organization  \nnonperforming loan \nordinary capital resources  \nProgram/project implementation unit \nProgram/project management unit  \nregional development bank  \nRural Economy Res uscitation Fund  \nrural finance \nrural finance institution \nRural Finance Sector Development Act  \nRural Finance Sector Development Agency \nRural Finance Sector Development Program \nSamurdhi banking society  \nSANASA Development Bank  \ntechnical assistance \nthrift and credit cooperative society \n", " \nNOTES \n", "ADB \nCBS \nCBSL \nCRB \nEA \nIA \nIT \nLIBOR  \nMF-NGO \nMIS \nMOC  \nMPDI \nMRE \nNDTF  \nNGO \nNPL \nOCR \nPIU \nPMU \nRDB  \nRERF \nRF \nRFI \nRFSD Act  \nRFSDA  \nRFSDP \nSBS \nSDB \nTA \nTCCS \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by A.
