THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Urban Environmental \nManagement in the Tonle Sap Basin Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  urban  environmental  infrastructure  in  Battambang,  Serei \nSaophoan, and Stueng Saen\u2014three provincial cities around the Tonle Sap lake.1 It will also \nimprove the institutional effectiveness of stakeholders to provide sustainable services and support \nan improved policy and planning environment for urban drainage, wastewater, and solid waste \nmanagement. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. In 2016, Cambodia had an estimated population of 15.2 million \nin 25 provinces, 26 cities, and numerous district cities. It is mainly a rural country, but rapid \nurbanization is expected to bring the urban population to 30% by 2030. Garments, construction, \nand tourism have driven Cambodia\u2019s robust 7% economic growth from 2013-2017.2 With an \nincreasingly  urban  economy,  urban  services  contribute  to  environmentally  sustainable  and \ninclusive growth by laying basic infrastructure for businesses and households, creating jobs, \nsafeguarding the surrounding environment, and reducing exposure to flooding and other extreme \nweather events. They also contribute to the health, welfare, and protection of Cambodia\u2019s people. \nStrong urban\u2013rural linkages mean that developments in Cambodia\u2019s growing provincial cities\u2014\nincluding Battambang (Battambang Province), Serei Saophoan (Banteay Meanchey Province), \nand Stueng Saen (Kampong Thom Province)\u2014spread to rural areas where poverty is more acute. \n \n4.  Tonle Sap basin. The Tonle Sap basin is home to about a third of Cambodia\u2019s population, \nand nearly half of its population depends on the lake\u2019s resources, particularly its fish, for livelihood. \nThe basin hosts one of the most productive inland fisheries in the world, contributing about 60% \nof the country\u2019s total production. Between 1998 and 2013, Cambodia\u2019s urban population growth \nrate of about 4% (one of the highest in Southeast Asia), combined with unprecedented rural\u2013\nurban migration, has led to significant growth in the basin\u2019s cities.3 The three project cities in the \nlargely  rural region\u2014together  with  Kampong Chhnang,  Pursat,  and Siemreap\u2014are key for \neconomic growth in the basin and their development is linked to the surrounding environment. \n \n5.  Urbanization and environmental impact. Rapid urbanization has resulted in significant \nenvironmental impact, including pollution, on the basin, which is designated a United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biosphere reserve. While flooding is \nimportant for maintaining the basin\u2019s ecosystem services, severe flooding can cause damage to \nlife and infrastructure and exacerbate pollution, as receding floodwaters leave accumulated solid \n                                                \n1  The project builds on the ongoing Integrated Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project, \nwhich supports flood protection, wastewater management, and solid waste management in two other provincial cities \nlocated around the lake, Kampong Chhnang and Pursat (Asian Development Bank [ADB]. Cambodia: Integrated \nUrban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project. https://www.adb.org/projects/42285-013/main). \n2  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook 2018: How Technology Affects Jobs. Manila. \n3  Government of Cambodia. 2014. Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey 2014. Phnom Penh. \n \n ", "2 \nand liquid waste. The basin\u2019s urban areas are located next to rivers and are sensitive to climate \nchange, with most experiencing flooding during the wet season.4 \n \n6.  Access to services. Except in Phnom Penh, the urban population\u2019s access to improved \nwater supply during the dry season was 69.7% in 2014, while access to piped water supply was \n42.2%. Wastewater and solid waste services are inadequate. While about 80.2% of the urban \npopulation had access to improved sanitation in 2014, 69.3% had individual systems (septic \ntanks) and only 10.7% had access to sewerage and wastewater treatment.5 More than 75% of \nhouseholds in urban areas, excluding Phnom Penh, do not have access to solid waste services. \nRapid urbanization will worsen these challenges. The main reasons for these service delivery \ngaps are (i) inadequate coverage and delivery of urban environmental infrastructure and services; \n(ii) inadequate management of public investments; and (iii) poor urban planning that did not \nconsider environmental management, disaster risk, and climate change events. \n \n7.  Policy  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2014\u20132018 \nidentifies key priorities for the urban sector, which include developing a national strategy for cities \nand master plans for urban infrastructure; ensuring environmental sustainability; installing solid \nand liquid waste management systems; and developing laws related to land management, \nurbanization, and construction.6 However, the actions for sanitation and solid waste are not well \ndefined. Regarding sanitation, the National Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation (2003) calls \nfor greater private sector participation, improved cost recovery, cross subsidies where needed, \nautonomy of public utilities, and the establishment of a regulatory body.7 \n \n8.  Institutional  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT) \nhandles asset creation for urban sanitation, and the provincial Departments of Public Works and \nTransport (DPWT) handle operation and maintenance (O&M). Solid waste management is the \ncity\u2019s responsibility. Because of limited technical capacity in provinces and municipalities, MPWT \ncontinues to be involved in the construction of large-scale infrastructure such as sewerage \nnetworks, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and controlled landfills. \n \n9.  Role of the private sector. Private sector investment in these urban services is limited, \ngiven the public nature of the assets, limited revenue potential, and limited capacity of the private \nsector. The exception is solid waste collection, where services are outsourced to the private sector \nin many cities, including the three project cities. \n \n10.  Project-specific constraints. The project cities experience the following constraints: \n(i)  In Battambang, 56% of the population of about 160,000 has access to piped water \nsupply, but only 5% has access to sewerage because of the limited coverage of \nthe existing sewer network (west of the river). Ongoing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) projects will expand water supply and address sewage collection and \ntreatment west of the river, but not to the east. Solid waste collection covers less \nthan 25% of the city\u2019s population. \n                                                \n4  The Tonle Sap river, which connects the Tonle Sap lake to the Mekong river, reverses its flow seasonally. During the \nwet season when the basin is flooded, the lake\u2019s surface area is four to six times larger than during the dry season \n(Mekong River Commission. 2010. Assessment of Basin-Wide Development Scenarios: Technical Note 10\u2014Impacts \non the Tonle Sap Ecosystem. Phnom Penh). \n5  Footnote 3. Improved sanitation includes flush and/or pour flush to sewers, septic tanks, and pit latrines with slab. \n6  Government of Cambodia. 2014. National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. \n7  Of the three project cities, only Battambang has an existing wastewater system, for which tariffs are collected through \nthe water supply bill with a 90% collection efficiency. Private companies collect solid waste fees and cover 15%\u2013\n25% of the cities\u2019 populations. \n \n ", "3 \n(ii)  About 46% of Serei Saophoan\u2019s population of about 61,000 and 35% of Stueng \nSaen\u2019s population of about 96,000 have access to piped water supply. They have \nno sewerage networks or WWTPs. About 20% of the population in Serei Saophan \nand less than 20% in Stueng Saen have regular solid waste collection, with waste \ndisposed in open dump sites.8 \n \n11.  Financial  management.  The  income  of  DPWTs  and  city  governments  is  highly \ndependent on national government transfers. DPWT revenue sources include transfers from the \nMPWT (more than 90% of revenue) and income from the sale and rental of properties, fines, and \npenalties. Major recurrent costs are salaries and administrative costs and O&M of facilities (mainly \nroads). On average, local revenues can only cover 10%\u201315% of recurrent expenditures. However, \nsurplus funds available for capital expenditures averaged $0.6 million\u2013$2.4 million in 2015\u20132017 \nfor the three DPWTs. For cities, local revenues covered only 14%\u201339% on average of recurrent \nexpenditures in 2016, with the remaining expenditure supported through national government \nallocations, including for solid waste collection and cleaning of public areas. \n \n12.  Support for urban environmental services in the Tonle Sap basin. ADB\u2019s Tonle Sap \nBasin Strategy highlighted the importance of the basin from an ecological, environmental, and \npoverty perspective, while the Urban Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map highlighted \nurban development in Tonle Sap as one of three priority areas.9 The Tonle Sap Urban Areas \nDevelopment Framework (TSUADF), 2014\u20132030 identified and prioritized urban infrastructure \nneeds for the six largest cities and provincial centers in the basin.10 \n \n13.  Ongoing support in the basin. The ongoing first phase project focuses on infrastructure \ninvestments and services (drainage, flood protection, solid waste management, and a natural \nwastewater treatment pond) in the two cities of Kampong Chhnang and Pursat. It also focuses on \nsmall-scale environmental improvements, coordination, and training.11 This project will continue \nthe programmatic implementation of the TSUADF by supporting the preparation of risk-sensitive \nurban master plans; providing urban environmental services that factor disaster and climate risk \nconsiderations; and strengthening institutional effectiveness in the next three priority cities of \nBattambang, Serei Saophoan, and Stueng Saen.12 \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  Cambodia\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment has focused on cities in the Tonle Sap basin, along the Greater Mekong Subregion \neconomic corridors, and in other provincial capitals, with investments in water supply, wastewater \nmanagement, flood protection, solid waste management, urban roads and markets. This project \nincorporates lessons learned, namely that (i) lack of financing for household connections and on-\nsite plumbing is detrimental to operational and financial sustainability of wastewater systems; (ii) \n                                                \n8  Open dump sites have little or no solid waste planning, management, record-keeping, compaction, or covering. \n9  ADB. 2005.

ADB approved the first phase in November 2015 and declared it \neffective in March 2016. Detailed engineering design and bidding documents for the first batch of subprojects is \nexpected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. Implementation delays are largely because of land \nacquisition and resettlement challenges and the need to procure four separate consulting services packages, some \nof which were not large enough to attract good consulting firms. These lessons have informed the design of the \nproposed second phase of the project. \n12 Other government, ADB, and development partner initiatives cover the urgent investment needs of the remaining \ncity in the TSUADF, Siemreap. \n \n ", "4 \ndelays in consultant recruitment and detailed designs result in unacceptably long project start-up \nperiods; and (iii) the approach to land acquisition must be comprehensive and practical and \naligned with the agreed resettlement framework.13 \n \n15.  Development coordination. ADB is a lead partner in Cambodia\u2019s urban sector. Project \npreparation involved coordination with other active development partners in the urban and water \nsector, including Japan International Cooperation Agency, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, \nand the World Bank. Support from these partners has mostly focused on larger cities such as \nPhnom Penh and Siemreap, with some engagements in cities such as Kampot, Kep, and Preah \nSihanouk. Besides ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency is the most active partner in \nthe sector, with a strong focus on Phnom Penh and strategic investments.  \n \n16.  Strategic context. The project aligns with Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Development \nPlan and the MPWT\u2019s requirements for improved and effective urban sanitation and solid waste. \nIt is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia and the Urban \nOperational Plan, 2012\u20132020, which encourages the economic competitiveness of cities, green \ndevelopment, and inclusive growth.14 \n \n17.  Value added by ADB assistance. By 2019, ADB will have ongoing urban and water \nsector projects in more than 15 of Cambodia\u2019s 26 provincial cities. ADB\u2019s growing program \nprovides sufficient scale to engage with the government on (i) strategic and policy issues, \nincluding master planning (ii) developing road maps for financial sustainability of urban services \nwhich include differentiated approaches based on affordability and (iii) exploring innovative \nnature-based solutions, such as use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment.15  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable, inclusive, equitable, and \nresilient growth achieved (footnote 6). The project will have the following outcome: urban services \nimproved in participating cities.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output 1: Urban environmental infrastructure improved. The project will finance (i) a \nnew 4,800 cubic meters (m3)/day capacity WWTP, 87 kilometers (km) of new sewers and a \n350,000 m3 landfill in Battambang; (ii) a new 2,300 m3/day capacity WWTP, 39 km of new sewers, \n17 km drainage network and a 48,000 m3 landfill in Stueng Saen; and (iii) a new 2,500 m3/day \ncapacity WWTP, 78 km of new sewers, 8.5 km drainage network and 130,000 m3 landfill in Serei \nSaophoan.17 It will also finance free house latrines for 760 poor households. The design of the \nWWTP, access roads, and drainage network will factor disaster and climate risk considerations. \n                                                \n13 ADB used a technical assistance grant for the preparation of feasibility studies, detailed designs, and bidding \ndocuments from the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund (financed by the Nordic Development Fund and \nadministered by ADB), in conjunction with resources from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), to \nensure higher project readiness. It prepared pre-feasibility studies and a medium-term investment program with \nsupport from the Cities Development Initiative for Asia.  \n14 ADB. 2014.

The project will finance free household connections to the sewer system (i.e., the line from the \nsewer to the boundary of the property). It also allocates financing for on-site plumbing (i.e., plumbing needed within \n \n ", "5 \n \n20.  Output 2: Institutional effectiveness improved. The project will strengthen institutional \neffectiveness by (i) improving staff capacity in critical areas, such as urban service delivery, urban \nfacilities O&M, and public\u2013private partnerships; and (ii) establishing urban service units.18 \n \n21.  Output 3: Policy and planning environment improved. The project will develop urban \ndevelopment strategies and risk-sensitive master plans for all three cities. It will develop a road \nmap for financial sustainability for wastewater and solid  waste, including a road map and \narrangement for  tariffs and  a  mechanism for ensuring  household  connections. It  will  build \ncommunity awareness on the benefits of proper hygiene and sanitation, sewerage systems, and \nsafe disposal of solid waste. \n \nD.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 18). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2019\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2023  \nEstimated loan and grant closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  MPWT secretary of state (chair); Ministry of Land Management, Urban \nPlanning and Construction; Ministry of Economy and Finance; Ministry of \nInterior; Ministry of Environment; and Tonle Sap Authority (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MPWT \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Provincial Departments of Public Works and Transport \n(iv)  Implementation unit  General Department of Public Works in MPWT, 8 staff  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  6 contracts  $77,120,000 \nConsulting services  Quality and cost-based selection  501 person-months  $5,650,000 \nAdvance contracting  MPWT has requested advance action for consulting services.  \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \n \n27.  One project management consultant (PMC) will provide consulting services for the project \nand the proposed Fourth Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns Development Project (which \nhas the same implementation period) under a single contract. The MPWT requested expressions \nof interest for PMC recruitment on 11 June 2018.21 The Project Readiness Improvement Fund \n                                                \n21 Both projects have a similar scope of work and implementation schedule and are managed by the same project \nmanagement unit (PMU) in MPWT. Combining their consulting service packages will attract a stronger firm, improve \neconomies of scale, and ensure a strong field presence of key international experts across both projects. \n ", "7 \nhelped improve project readiness (footnote 13). By project effectiveness, the detailed engineering \ndesign  and  bidding  documents  for  wastewater  treatment  and  management  in  two  cities, \nrepresenting 40% of the project financing, will be completed. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  Technical due diligence confirmed the project is technically viable. Wastewater and \ndrainage design is based on projected storm water runoff and wastewater generation, and the \nrequired treated effluent quality for receiving waters.22 Following an alternatives analysis that \nconsidered lagoon-based treatment systems and constructed wetlands, the MPWT selected the \nformer as a lowest life-cycle cost solution that are easy to maintain. In Serei Saophoan, the MPWT \nwill explore, during detailed design, the option to integrate a constructed wetland (nature-based \napproach) in the final stage of treatment. For solid waste, following an alternatives analysis that \nconsidered three options (controlled dump site, controlled landfill and a fully engineered sanitary \nlandfill). the MPWT selected controlled landfills for all cities, with sufficient capacity to house waste \nuntil 2040. It selected reinjection and recirculation as a practical option for leachate treatment, \nconsistent with ADB guidelines.23 The project will prepare closure plans for existing dump sites \nand finance the rehabilitation and closure of two dump sites on public land. The project is \nclassified medium risk from future climate change impacts. The project design includes climate \nadaptation and disaster risk reduction measures for the WWTPs in Battambang and Serei \nSaophoan (including raising the WWTPs and access roads) and drainage networks where pipes \nare designed to cater to 10-year flood return periods plus a safety factor for climate change.24 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable. The economic analysis followed \nADB\u2019s guidelines and covered 25 years from the start of implementation in 2019 to 2043. The \ndisability-adjusted-life-year approach was used to measure the health and environmental benefits \nof better wastewater management and the public health benefits from reduced inhalation of toxic \nfumes associated with burning waste as a result of the solid waste management components. \nAvoidance of flood damage and losses from disrupted economic activity during floods quantified \nthe benefits of better drainage. The overall project economic internal rate of return for the three \ncities is 16.9% for the base case scenario and 14.5%\u201316.8% for the sensitivity tests, above the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. \n \n30.  Financial analysis. Financial due diligence for each subproject evaluated the financial \nsustainability  of  operating  the  infrastructure,  including O&M  and  any required subsidies.  A \nfinancial evaluation of the revenue-generating wastewater system and solid waste management \nin the three cities indicated that the government will be unable to achieve full cost recovery through \nits projected tariff collection. The financial sustainability risk rating is substantial and a subsidy or \nviability gap financing was estimated. For the wastewater and drainage subprojects, the MPWT \nsupported the Battambang DPWT to enter an agreement with the provincial waterworks to collect \na wastewater fee on the water bill and will support the other two DPWTs in establishing a similar \n                                                \n22 The population density in the service areas (50\u2013150 people per hectare) is sufficient to justify centralized treatment. \nFor context, the average population density in Phnom Penh is 55 people per hectare. WWTPs will meet standards \nfor discharge into public water areas and sewers, i.e., 80 milligrams per liter of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand \nand 100 milligrams per liter of chemical oxygen demand (Sub-Decree No. 27 ANRK.BK on Water Pollution Control). \n23 ADB. 2017. Integrated Solid Waste Management for Local Governments: A Practical Guide. Manila. \n24 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \narrangement. For solid waste, each city will develop a financial sustainability road map to increase \nservice coverage to 80% of the urban population and link compensation to the private operator\u2019s \nperformance. The government will ensure that MPWT and/or DPWT will cover any O&M shortfall.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  ADB developed a risk assessment and risk management plan jointly with the government. \nThe MPWT has experience in ADB-financed projects, and procurement capacity assessments \nhave concluded that the MPWT has strong capacity to conduct procurement in accordance with \nADB requirements. The financial management risk is moderate due to constrained resources for \nasset and financial management. A time-bound action plan will mitigate risks through (i) loan \ncovenants on the appropriation of counterpart funds and anticorruption measures, (ii) periodic \npublic financial management training, and (iii) additional mitigation measures described in the risk \nmanagement plan.25 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  MPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  The project will directly benefit about 41,800 households, including 6,850 poor households \nand 7,940 households headed by women. It is classified general intervention. Through improved \nurban services, project area residents will benefit from reduced loss of productivity, medical \nexpenditures, and indebtedness. Pro-poor design features include (i) free sewerage connections \nfor all households, (ii) sanitation grants to identified poor households requiring replumbing to \nconnect to the sewerage system, and (iii) free toilets for poor households. \n \n33.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment identified \n(i)  limited  access  to  reliable,  safe,  and  affordable  urban  services;  and  (ii)  low  women\u2019s \nparticipation in sector representation as key gender issues. Women\u2019s priority concerns include \nimproved access to toilets, improved urban services, and affordable urban services. The gender \naction plan (i) has targets to increase women\u2019s representation in PMU and project implementation \nunit, (ii) includes gender-responsive measures in urban development strategy and urban master \nplans to ensure equitable access to urban facilities and services, and (iii) has targets for training. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as below.26 For facility sites to be acquired by the government after loan approval, \nMPWT assessed alternate sites at the feasibility stage and final sites will be confirmed during \nimplementation based on topographic surveys, soil investigations, and detailed designs. \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  The  initial  environmental  examination  report  and  three \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) covering all subprojects are based on the preliminary \ndesign.27 The MPWT disclosed the initial environmental examination report and the EMPs on the \nADB website on 9 May 2018. It will obtain approval from the Ministry of Environment after the \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB.

The MPWT carried out public consultations to inform the project \ndesign  and  will  continue  to  do so  during  implementation. The  EMPs  detail  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  for  identified  impacts,  institutional  arrangements,  and  implementation \nbudget.  MPWT  will  oversee  EMP  implementation  with  the  PMC\u2019s  support  and  a  full-time \nenvironment PMU environmental safeguard officer.28 \n \n36.  During project preparation, the MPWT confirmed sites for the two wastewater subprojects \nin Battambang and Stueng Saen. For the WWTP in Serei Saophoan and three landfills in three \ncities, the EMPs include a preliminary assessment of environmental impacts across several \nalternate sites, which will be confirmed after approval. The MPWT selected these sites to avoid \nor minimize impacts. The project will have net positive environmental and health benefits through \nreduced pollution and floods. Construction will have short-term, localized impacts such as surface \nwater quality deterioration, noise, dust, traffic, and waste generation. During facility operation, \neffluent discharges and landfill leachate will need to be carefully managed. These impacts can be \nprevented or minimized through EMP implementation, effective O&M, and capacity building.  \n \n37.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  will  involve  the  acquisition  of \nprivately owned lands, resulting in temporary and limited permanent impact on incomes from loss \nof access to farming lands. No physical relocation is expected. During project preparation, the \nMPWT confirmed sites for two subprojects and prepared draft resettlement plans following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and Cambodian laws and regulations. None of the 44 displaced \nhouseholds in Battambang will experience major impacts, but 12 of 20 displaced households in \nStueng Saen will experience major impacts. The MPWT has prepared a resettlement framework \nto screen subproject sites and guide the preparation of resettlement plans after the completion of \ndetailed engineering design for the four sites that will be confirmed after approval.29 The MPWT \nwill submit resettlement plans to ADB for review and approval before awarding any contracts and \nwill implement them before construction starts. Sites with category A impacts will not be financed. \nThe MPWT disclosed the resettlement framework and plans on the ADB website on 23 May 2018.  \n \n38.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance's General Department of Resettlement (GDR) has \nthe experience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement impact. The GDR will: (i) conduct \ntraining on ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement to build the capacity of relevant stakeholders; (ii) \nensure that any physically or economically affected persons are compensated at full replacement \ncost before civil works begin; and (iii) establish an effective, gender-inclusive grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of communities' concerns over project \nimpacts, with attention to vulnerable people. The PMU will have dedicated full-time staff to support \ncompliance with ADB safeguard requirements. The GDR will update the draft resettlement plans \nbased on detailed design and in accordance with the resettlement framework and will implement \nthem before civil works begin. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The poverty and social assessment confirmed that \nCham, Vietnamese, and Chinese ethnic minorities (considered indigenous peoples by ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement) reside in the larger project service areas. The two subprojects with \nconfirmed sites will not adversely affect any indigenous peoples. For any unanticipated impacts, \nthe MPWT prepared and disclosed an indigenous peoples planning framework on 9 May 2018.30 \n                                                \n28 The MPWT has implemented several ADB projects and understands ADB requirements, but the PMU does not have \nspecialist safeguards resources to date, which is why full-time staff will be appointed. \n29 Resettlement Framework; Resettlement Plan: Stueng Saen; and Resettlement Plan: Battambang (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.
