The Project covers the northern part of Viet Nam, \nwhich  is  relatively  poor.  The  Project  will  enable  power  to  be \nsupplied to the planned industrial zones in the region, thereby \nfacilitating  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities. \nThus, it will benefit the poor and ethnic minorities living in the \nproject area. The Project will also create the potential for power \ninterconnection between Viet Nam and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. \n    \nRationale  Economic growth has been averaging about 7% per year over the \npast  decade.  This,  in  turn,  has  fueled  growth  in  demand  for \nelectricity by about 15% per year. This rapid economic expansion \nhas helped Viet Nam reduce the share of the population living in \npoverty from 58% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The Government\u2019s aim \nis to maintain this economic growth until 2010, and to reduce \npoverty incidence to 19%. Due to the strong economic growth, \nViet Nam\u2019s electricity supply deficit is growing, especially during \nthe dry season, due to its heavy dependence on hydropower. To \nmeet the load growth, the Government plans to more than double \nthe current installed capacity to 22,600 megawatts (MW) by 2010. \nIf not addressed quickly and effectively, this deficit will constrain \nthe quality and reliability of electricity supply to rural, industrial, \ncommercial,  and  residential  consumers  in  northern  Viet  Nam. \nLoad shedding and significant voltage fluctuations are prevalent, \nundermining the operating cost structures of businesses across \nindustry, services, and trade. \n \nWith increased generation capacity, transmission bottlenecks will \nworsen, increasing transmission losses, unless the transmission \nsystem  in  the  north  is  strengthened  and  developed.  EVN \nenvisages an investment requirement of $17.5 billion up to 2010, \nwhich will not materialize without long-term finance. While local \nfinance is available, the terms are comparatively short. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  through  its  intervention,  can  be  a \n ", "ii   \ncatalyst for additional finance for EVN\u2019s investment program. A \nrobust  and  reliable  transmission  network  with  an  enabling \nenvironment will attract increased private sector participation in \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Policy  dialogue  on \nsafeguard  issues,  and  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  reviewing  and \nproviding  comments  to  refine  EVN\u2019s  environmental  and  social \npolicy and procedures, will contribute to EVN\u2019s adoption of best \npractices in safeguard policies and implementation of safeguard \nmeasures.  \n \nThrough its loan covenants, the proposed Project will further the \nongoing power sector reforms to restructure EVN and create a \nviable electricity supply industry in Viet Nam, as well as to improve \nconfidence of private sector investors in the nascent regulatory \nframework.  \n   \nImpacts and Outcome  The Project will strengthen the northern transmission network to \nimprove  system  reliability,  remove  transmission  bottlenecks, \nreduce transmission losses, and facilitate efficient utilization of \nexisting  and  planned  power  plants.  ADB\u2019s  programmed \ninterventions  in  the  sector  for  2006\u20132010  will  support  power \nsector  reforms  aimed  at  establishing  a  \u201csingle-buyer\u201d  power \nmarket structure and transparent regulation of the sector by 2009. \n   \nCost Estimates  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance subprojects \nunder EVN\u2019s transmission expansion program. The subprojects \nare estimated to cost $452.7 million, including physical and price \ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. \nThis comprises a foreign exchange cost of $226.2 million and a \nlocal currency cost of $226.5 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nFinancing Source  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency \nADB  226.2  133.8  360.0  79.5 \nEVN   0  92.7  92.7  20.5 \n  Total Project Cost  226.2  226.5  452.7  100.0 \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, EVN = Electricity of Viet Nam. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $360 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Viet Nam will act as the Borrower for the ADB \nTerms  loan. The loan proceeds will be onlent to EVN, as the Executing \nAgency, on terms acceptable to ADB, and at ADB\u2019s interest rate ", "  iii\napplicable to ordinary capital resources loans, plus an onlending \nfee, set at 0.2% per year. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented using a sector loan approach. \nArrangements  The subprojects that have not been appraised will be submitted \nfor  ADB\u2019s  approval  during  implementation.  EVN  will  be \nresponsible  for  planning,  designing,  contracting,  testing,  and \ncommissioning the subprojects. For each subproject that has not \nbeen appraised, EVN will submit an appraisal report with an initial \nenvironmental examination report and a resettlement plan (RP) to \nADB  for  approval.  EVN  will  also  provide  ADB  with  half-yearly \nprogress reports for project monitoring. \n \nThe  Project  will  use  the  Northern  Power  Project  Management \nBoard  (NPPMB)  and  the  Central  Power  Project  Management \nBoard (CPPMB) as the implementing agencies. NPPMB will be \nresponsible for the upgrading and construction of the 500 kV and \n220 kV substations and transmission lines, while CPPMB will be \nresponsible for the 500 kV/220 kV Soc Son station. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Electricity of Viet Nam \n   \nProcurement  Equipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The following consultants services are required: (i) international \nresettlement  consultants  to  assist  NPPMB  in  preparing  and \nimplementing the RPs, (ii) international environmental consultant \nto assist NPPMB in implementing the environment management \nplan  (EMP),  (iii)  domestic  environmental  consultants  for \nmonitoring and implementing the EMP, and (iv) domestic gender \nspecialist to implement the gender strategy. The international and \ndomestic consultants will be recruited individually in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The \nGovernment  requested  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants  to  minimize  front-end  delays  in  project \nimplementation. ADB approved early recruitment, and informed \nthe Government that this would not commit ADB to finance the \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By  strengthening  and  developing  the  northern  transmission \nBeneficiaries  network, the Project is expected to enable efficient and reliable \ndelivery  of  electricity  to  consumers,  particularly  benefiting \nindustrial, commercial, and residential customers in the country. \nBy supporting industrial and commercial activity, the Project will \ncreate jobs, as well as improve the productivity and quality of \noutputs in the manufacturing sectors. This will enhance production \n ", "iv   \nand economic growth in the north, increasing employment and \nincome-earning opportunities for the poor. The Project will remove \ntransmission  bottlenecks  and  reduce  transmission  losses, \nensuring availability of more electricity for rural electrification.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The financial and economic viability of the Project depends on the \nimplementation  of  the  other  components  (ongoing  projects)  of \npower system expansion in northern Viet Nam. These include \nsignificant investments in new power generation capacity, as well \nas  transmission  capacity  outside  the  scope  of  the  proposed \nProject.  Mobilization  of  these  investments  requires  concerted \nefforts by EVN and other public sector investors, as well as private \nsector  financing.  EVN  and  the  Government  are  creating  the \nenabling environment by removing entry barriers for private sector \nparticipation  (domestic  and  foreign)  through  proposed  power \nsector  reforms,  as  required  by  the  2004  Electricity  Law.  To \nsupport the reforms, the Government established the Electricity \nRegulatory Authority in October 2005. \n \nA  potential  concern  is  the  failure  of  the  economy  to  continue \nachieving its assumed economic growth rate of 7.5%. A slower \neconomic expansion would lower the growth in electricity demand. \nHowever, the analysis of risks shows that the economic viability of \nthe investment program can withstand extreme adverse changes \nin anticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and \nassumptions. \n   \nImplementation  delays  and  resettlement  could  create  risks  of \ndelays in the commissioning of power projects under construction \nin northern Viet Nam. These delays would constrain the economic \ngrowth of the northern region. ADB has engaged the Government \nin  policy  dialogue  on  the  environment  and  social  safeguard \nrequirements  for  two  ongoing  hydropower  projects\u2014the  2,400 \nMW  Son  La  Hydropower  Project  (SLHPP)  and  560  MW  Huoi \nQuang Hydropower Project (HQHPP). About 95,000 people will \nbe  displaced  by  these  two  projects.  Stand-alone  technical \nassistance  is  being  formulated  that  would  address  (i) \nstrengthening and improving the implementation of an EMP for \nSLHPP  and  HQHPP,  including  building  the  capacity  of  the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and \nEVN  to  implement  the  EMP  for  SLHPP;  (ii)  capacity  building \nneeds of MONRE and EVN for undertaking broader cumulative \nand strategic environmental assessments to address safeguard \nissues  across  the  sector;  and  (iii)  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity of local stakeholders for implementing SLHPP livelihood \nand RPs. \n \nNo  technological  risk  exists.  EVN  has  been  using  extra  high \nvoltage  transmission  technology,  and  has  sufficient  in-house \ntechnical  capability  for  project  design  management  and \nimplementation, and operation and maintenance.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, for the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector \nProject.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Viet  Nam  continued  to  be  one  of  the  world\u2019s  fastest  growing  economies  in  2004. \nSupported by buoyant consumption and investments, economic growth reached 7.5% in 2004. \nThe Government\u2019s next 5-year socioeconomic development plan (SEDP, draft)1 targets 7.5%\u2013\n8.0% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2006\u20132010, creating 8 million jobs, \neliminating hunger, and reducing poverty to 15%\u201318% by 2010.2 The Government and its \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  recognize  that  the \neconomic expansion was critical in reducing poverty in Viet Nam. To sustain economic growth \nand  continue  reducing  poverty,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  modernize  and  develop  its  physical \ninfrastructure by maintaining an investment level of at least 35% of GDP.  \n \n3.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS),3  which  the \nPrime  Minister  approved  in  November  2003,  acknowledges  the  importance  of  large-scale \ninfrastructure in achieving poverty reduction through growth. It also recognizes the financing \ngap, and the need for alternative resources, such as the use of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR), for selective revenue-earning investment projects in the power and transport sectors. \n \n4.  Developing an efficient and stable power sector is essential to achieving the 7.5% \naverage annual growth target up to 2010. Electricity demand is forecast to increase by 15%\u2013\n16% per year between 2004 and 2010, and 12% per year thereafter, fueled by robust economic \ngrowth. In 2004, electricity demand was 8,283 megawatt (MW), while electricity consumption \nwas 39.9 terawatt-hours (TWh). During 1995\u20132004, electricity consumption increased more \nthan threefold (11.2 TWh to 39.9 TWh), and system losses fell from 21.7% to 13.5%. The \nrevised Fifth Power Development Master Plan (PDMP) for 2001\u201320104 forecasts electricity \ngeneration to reach 100\u2013112.7 TWh, with peak demand reaching 17,570\u201319,550 MW, in 2010. \n \n5.  Despite such growth in electricity demand, end-use consumption totaled about 500 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) per capita for 2004, compared with an average of about 1,300 kWh per \ncapita  per  year  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  Industrial  and  residential  sectors \naccounted for about 45% of electricity consumption in 2004. Even though the service sector has \nplayed  a  role  in  the  demand  growth,  industry  and  residential  consumption  primarily  are \nresponsible for the growth in electricity demand. Rapid growth in the manufacturing sector drove \nthe increase in industrial electricity usage. Industry\u2019s share of GDP increased from 22.6% in \n1995 to 30.8% in 2004. Industrial electricity demand growth rose by 18.5% during 2001\u20132004, \nand is expected to continue driving demand. \n                                                 \n1  This draft will be approved by the Prime Minister in April 2006. All development partners including ADB, will then \nalign their country strategies and program assistance with the approved SEDP. \n2  Household living standard surveys found that the poverty rate was around 58% in 1993, 37% in 1998, 29% in \n2002, and is estimated to be 25% in 2005. \n3  Government of Viet Nam. November 2003. Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. Viet Nam.  \n4  Ministry of Industry, Government of Viet Nam, 2003. The Sixth Power Development Master Plan is being prepared, \nand the Government is expected to approve it in December 2005. \n ", "2     \n6.  An increase in household access and the addition of loads other than basic lighting \npushed up residential electricity demand. Between 1995 and 2004, about 30 million new people \nwere  connected,  representing  37%  of  the  population.  Viet  Nam  started  from  a  very  low \nresidential  consumption  level,  which  helped  explain  the  high  growth  rates.  As  disposable \nincomes rose since the mid-1990s, electrical household appliances have increased. The current \naverage consumption of about 20 kWh/month per person among residential electricity users is \nlow, and is likely to increase. \n \n7.  To meet the electricity demand growth, Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) expects to increase \nits installed generating capacity from 10,871 MW in 2004 to 22,600 MW by 2010. This means \nadding about 2,000 MW per year between 2005 and 2010. This is more than a threefold \nincrease over the average capacity increase each year during the 1990s. In addition, high-\nvoltage  and  medium-voltage  transmission  and  distribution  systems  need  to  be  improved \ncommensurately to address transmission bottlenecks and reduce system losses. The sector \nanalysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n8.  The key challenges facing the power sector are maintaining adequate investments in \nnew generating capacity, and expanding transmission networks to meet the rapid growth in \nelectricity  demand.  These  are  critical  to  maintaining  the  growth,  competitiveness,  and \nindustrialization of Viet Nam\u2019s economy. The Fifth PDMP, revised in March 2003, states that the \npower sector will require $17.5 billion in investment for 2004\u20132010, comprising $13.0 billion for \ngeneration and $4.5 billion for transmission and distribution. EVN\u2019s internal cash generation can \nprovide only half of the funding requirement. Therefore, official development assistance, private \nsector investment, and domestic commercial banks will have to fill the financing gap. The \noperational and financial performance of EVN has improved consistently over the past 5 years. \nAlthough the average tariff at around $0.052/kWh is below the long-run marginal cost, the self-\nfinancing ratio and debt service coverage ratio have been maintained. EVN\u2019s financial accounts \nare strictly separate from the Government budget, and EVN receives no Government budget \nsubsidy support for investment with the exception of funds for resettlement. The increased \nborrowing of the sector to finance the large capital investment program will require improvement \nin the sector\u2019s internal cash generation.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Policies \n \n9.  The Government recognizes the need to continue sector reforms to meet the challenges \nfacing the power sector, especially the financing challenge. In recent years, EVN has developed \na much greater commercial orientation, and has signed power purchase agreements with the \nprivate sector for two power generation projects5 with a combined capacity of 1,435 MW under \nthe build, operate, and transfer scheme. The Government\u2019s power sector policy, as stated in the \nnew Electricity Law,6 is to (i) develop a power market on the principles of transparency and \ncompetition to achieve economic efficiency, (ii) attract investments from state and non\u2013state \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Mekong Energy Company Limited (Phu My 2.2 Power Project). Manila (Loan \n1856-VIE, for $50 million [loan] and $25 million [partial risk guarantee], approved on 2 July 2002); and ADB. 2003. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Phu My 3 Power Company. Manila (Loan 1923-VIE, for $40 million [loan] and $35 \nmillion [partial risk guarantee], approved on 18 October 2003). \n6  The new Electricity Law was approved on 3 December 2004 and became effective on 1 July 2005. ", "    3 \nsectors, (iii) encourage foreign private sector investments, and (iv) ensure the rights of the \nconsumers and the investors in the sector. To achieve these objectives, the Ministry of Industry \n(MOI) is responsible for establishing a competitive power market for Viet Nam.    \n \n10.  MOI prepared the road map for Electricity Market Establishment and Development in \nViet Nam, which envisages corporate restructuring of EVN to establish the first stage of the \npower market. The first stage (2005\u20132008) of the power market is to establish an internal pilot \nmarket for EVN-owned power plants and plants in which EVN holds a dominant share. The \nexisting independent power producers (IPP), and the three strategic multipurpose hydropower \nplants, will not take part in the internal power market. The IPPs will dispatch power according to \ntheir power purchase agreements. During the first stage, the following will be developed and \npiloted: (i) market rules; (ii) regulatory, technical, and commercial institutions; and (iii) capacity \nrequired for operating the second phase (2008\u20132010) of the proposed power market (i.e., single \nbuyer-based competitive generation market with the participation of non-EVN power plants).  \n \n11.  The Government policy is also to encourage the development of independent power \ngeneration outside of EVN systems. The IPPs\u2019 generating capacity has increased from 620 MW \nin 2002 to over 2,400 MW in 2004, accounting for almost 22% of the installed generating \ncapacity.  Vinacoal  and  PetroVietnam  are  developing  IPPs,  both  wholly  owned  or  as  joint \nventures with EVN. Small hydropower plants are also being development by local firms, for \nconnection to the grid through power purchase agreements with EVN. \n \n12.  EVN will complete its corporate restructuring program by 2008. EVN\u2019s internal power \nmarket is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2006, with the competitive generation market \nbeginning in 2009. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) for the power sector will be \nestablished  within  the  MOI  as  a  separate  institution  by  the  end  of  2005  (para.  20).  The \nGovernment is aware of the concern over the degree of independence of the single buyer and \nthe system operator if EVN continues to own and control a significant stake in the equitized7 \npower plants. To mitigate these concerns, transparent rules for market operation, dispatching of \npower plants, settlement of payments and appropriate regulatory oversight will be required. If \nthese conditions cannot be guaranteed, the single buyer and the system operator will have to be \nseparated from EVN. To address these concerns, the Government asked ADB to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for designing appropriate market rules and regulatory instruments to \nmake the emerging power market attractive to potential investors.  \n \n13.  As  an  active  member  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Power  Sector \nCooperation Program, Viet Nam is financing a 220 kV transmission line linking with Cambodia \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Further, Viet Nam is planning power transmission \ninterconnections  with  other  GMS  countries.  Viet  Nam  has  ratified  the  Inter-Governmental \nAgreement on GMS Power trading, and is a signatory to the memorandum of understanding on \nInitiating Power Trading among GMS countries, which was signed at the Second GMS Summit \nin July 2005. \n \n2.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n14.  ADB has approved $306.3 million in loans to the power sector of Viet Nam. The loans \nwere primarily for the extension and rehabilitation of high-voltage transmission networks and \nsubstations, medium- and low-voltage substations, and distribution networks in the northern, \n                                                 \n7  Equitized means partial privatization with less than 50% divestization of assets. \n ", "4     \ncentral, and southern regions of the country. In addition, ADB has provided $9.78 million in TA, \ncomprising six project preparatory TAs and 11 advisory TAs (Appendix 2). The recent advisory \nTA on the road map8 for power sector reform has contributed significantly to the recently \nenacted Electricity Law, and established the framework for a wholesale electricity market. ADB \nalso has supported private sector investment in power generation through its private sector \noperations.  \n \n15.  The other major funding agencies are Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  World  Bank,  and  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency (Sida). AFD has cofinanced Loan 2128-VIE9 with ADB for \n\u20ac40 million, and will cofinance the proposed Project. JBIC, the biggest lender to the power \nsector in Viet Nam, has committed since 1993 approximately $3 billion, or 33.7% of its official \ndevelopment aid (ODA) budget, to Viet Nam. These funds were mainly for gas- and coal-fired \nthermal power plants, hydropower plants, and 500 kV transmission lines. The World Bank has \ncommitted $1.35 billion in loans to the sector for generation, transmission, distribution, and rural \nelectrification.  In  addition,  it  has  provided  TA  in  (i)  power  sector  policy  and  strategy,  (ii) \ninstitutional strengthening, (iii) private sector participation in infrastructure, (iv) gas master plan, \n(v) petroleum product pricing, (vi) development of the Electricity Law, and (vii) promotion of \nrenewable and rural electrification. \n \n16.  Sida, which began supporting the power sector in the 1980s, has committed $103 million \nin ODA funds (loans and TAs). Its assistance includes the recently equitized (partially privatized) \nSong Hinh (70 MW) multipurpose hydropower project. Sida is financing the rehabilitation of rural \ndistribution  systems  in  selected  provinces.  With  the  Norwegian  Development  Cooperation \nAgency, Sida also is supporting Viet Nam\u2019s preparation of a hydroelectric power development \nplan. Other bilateral sources of assistance to the sector include Canada, France, Germany, and \nUnited Kingdom. ADB coordinates closely with AFD, JBIC, World Bank, and bilateral donors to \nensure that actions are complementary and policy advice on the sector is consistent.  \n \n  3.  Asian Development Bank Strategy for the Power Sector \n \n17.  In line with the CPRGS, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector is to develop infrastructure \nneeded for economic growth and poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s assistance for the  sector has six \nmain  priorities:  (i) supporting  sector  reform,  including  market  restructuring,  and  sector  and \ncorporate governance; (ii) providing institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by \nthe 2004 Electricity Law; (iii) creating an enabling environment for private sector participation in \na  competitive  power  market;  (iv) expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (v) encouraging power interconnections in the GMS by helping Viet Nam to improve its \nhigh-voltage  power  transmission  network;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation,  and \nensuring environmental and social sustainability. The Private Sector Operations Department, in \ncoordination  with  Mekong  Department  and  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations,  is  promoting \npublic-private  partnership  projects  for  mobilizing  private  sector  investments  to  complement \nADB\u2019s investments transparently.  \n \n18.  Given the high electrification ratio of about 88%, as well as the availability of financing \nfrom  the  World  Bank  for  rural  electrification,  the  financing  gap  in  the  power  distribution \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

", "    5 \nsubsector is small. Further, the financial return of remaining rural electrification investments \ndoes not justify financing through OCR. Hence, future ADB investments in the power sector will \nfocus on power generation and transmission.10 ADB has a comparative advantage in expanding \nthe scope of engagement to financing environmentally sustainable power generation projects, \nand high-voltage transmission lines linking Viet Nam with other GMS countries. The institutional \ncapacity building program under the GMS Regional Power Trading Coordination Committee \nprovides further opportunities for Viet Nam to participate in the GMS Power Grid. \n \n19.  The investment loans to be financed with OCR will be coupled with policy dialogue to \nimprove technical, financial, and economic viability, as well as the social and environmental \nsustainability, of Viet Nam\u2019s power generation expansion programs. TAs will be targeted to \nsector entities, and national and provincial enforcement agencies, to improve their capacity to \ndeal with adverse impacts of some of these power generation projects.  \n \n  4.  Policy Dialogue \n \n20.  Since 1995, ADB has engaged the Government and EVN in policy dialogue on power \nsector reform under its previous loans and TAs. The sector reform covenants have included \n(i) promulgating  the  Electricity  Law,  (ii) preparing  secondary  laws  or  decrees  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  Electricity  Law,  (iii) establishing  an  independent  regulator,  and \n(iv) ensuring  that  EVN  and  its  power  companies11  undertake  steps  to  commercialize  their \noperations in line with the recommendations of TA 2345-VIE.12 However, due to high-profile \nfailures of restructured and competitive power markets worldwide, the Government proceeded \ncautiously. It spent time examining the most appropriate structure and strategy for power sector \nreform. As a result, the Electricity Law was approved in November 2004 and became effective \non 1 July 2005. The Prime Minister on 19 October 2005 approved MOI\u2019s decision on the \nestablishment of an Electricity Regulatory Authority within MOI. The Government has directed \nEVN to continue corporatizing13 and equitizing (i.e., partially privatizing) some of its operating \nunits.  \n \n21.  Despite  the  ambitious  plans  to  divest  a  large  portion  of  EVN-owned  power  plants \nthrough an equitization program, EVN will continue to own fully or partly a large proportion of the \ngeneration capacity during the first and second stages of the power market development. The \ndominant market share of EVN would create apprehensions among new investors. To make the \nemerging  power  market  attractive  to  potential  investors,  these  fears  would  have  to  be \naddressed through appropriately designed market rules and regulatory instruments. The power \nmarket  reform  program  in Viet  Nam  during  2006\u20132010  comprises  (i) setting  up the  power \nmarket and developing the market rules for a single buyer market, (ii) establishing the regulatory \nagency for the sector, (iii) cooperate restructuring of EVN to meet the requirement of a single \nbuyer market, and (iv) procuring new generation capacity consistent with the least-cost power \ndevelopment  plan.  A  proposed  ADB  TA  on  Power  Market  Design  would  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  road  map.  Policy  dialogue  aimed  at  establishing  a  transparent  and \ncompetitive power market in Viet Nam is closely coordinated with AFD, JBIC, and World Bank to \nguide MOI in implementing the road map. AFD is financing a resident advisor to assist MOI in \n                                                 \n10  A power sector road map will be prepared in early 2006 based on the updated Sixth PDMP. \n11  Power Company 1, Power Company 2, Power Company 3, Power Company Hanoi, Power Company Ho Chi Minh, \nPower Company Haiphong, and Power Company Dong Nai. \n12 ADB.  1995.

The proposed Project will \naugment and enhance previous sector reform through appropriate loan covenants.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government on social and environmental safeguard \nrequirements has resulted in the Government issuing improved legislation on compensation and \nresettlement. Decree 197/2004/ND-CP on Compensation Assistance and Resettlement when \nthe State Recovers Land was issued on 3 December 2004.14 In addition, EVN has taken \nconcrete measures to strengthen its appraisal capacity and construct management departments \nwith full-time staff to handle resettlement issues. The Government has prepared a Master Plan \nfor Hydropower Development with assistance from Sida and Norway. Given the need to ensure \nsuch hydropower development is sustainable, environmentally sound, and sensitive to impacts \nand risks, the Government requested ADB assistance to build the capacity of Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) and EVN to undertake cumulative impact assessment \nand strategic environment assessment. The Government also requested assistance to address \nsector-wide  environmental  and  social  issues,  and  to  take  an  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement approach for hydropower projects.  \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n \n23.  Loans 135815 and 158516 were closed in 2002 and 2005, respectively. These two loans \nhad to be extended due to delays in procurement, resettlement, and compensation. However, \nthe overall implementation was satisfactory in terms of outputs, and most of the financial and \nsafeguard-related covenants were complied with. The key lessons learned from these loans \nwere  the  need  to  ensure  that  (i)  technical  designs  are  completed  before  procurement  of \nequipment and material to match design requirements; (ii) delegation of procurement approval \nto the project management board is obtained; (iii) the process for bid document approval and \ncontract award applicable to ADB-financed contracts under the loan is clarified at the outset; (iv) \na satisfactory resettlement plan and framework is in place before loan approval; and (v) specific \nenvironmental requirements (including documentation and reporting) for testing and disposal of \ntransformers are included in loan covenant and bidding documents.   \n \n24.  The loan covenants on tariff reforms and sector reforms were not complied with fully. \nTariff covenants were set at a level above the financial cost recovery tariff, and the Government \ncould not justify increasing tariffs as EVN was meeting the financial ratio covenants. As a result, \nADB and the World Bank have agreed that financial ratios would be used to set the average \ntariff. These ratios would be based on audited financial statements, which focus on internal cash \ngeneration, such as debt service coverage and self-financing ratios that also indirectly capture \nprofitability. These ratios also would capture the financing requirement of the large capital \nexpenditure program, and the increased returns expected by private investors in the sector. The \nfinancial performance and projections of EVN are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

", "    7 \n25.  The TAs attached to loans 1358 (footnote 15) and 1585 (footnote 16) concentrated on \nproviding (i) capacity building to the sector on financial management of EVN\u2019s distribution units, \n(ii) cost-based electricity tariff setting, (iii) commercialization of distribution companies, and (iv) \nsetting up a power sector regulatory framework. As a result, the corporate governance of the \nsector has improved. The more recent TA on the road map for power sector reform contributed \nsignificantly to the new Electricity Law, and laid the foundation for the proposed sector reforms \naimed at establishing a wholesale electricity market. ADB is processing an advisory TA to guide \nthe Government in making strategic decisions regarding the (i) market structure; (ii) role of EVN \nand its subsidiaries, and the relationship among these entities; (iii) nature of the regulatory \nregime and key regulatory mechanisms; and (iv) the terms of power purchase arrangements for \nnew and equitized power plants. \n \n26.  The Government\u2019s approval process, particularly for project procurement, remains time \nconsuming, which has led to project implementation delays. To compensate, the Project has \nundertaken advance procurement action. Moreover, project management responsibilities have \nbeen delegated to the Northern Power Project Management Board (NPPMB) and Central Power \nManagement  Board  (CPPMB)  to  ensure  smooth  implementation.  As  these  agencies  are \ndependent units of EVN, EVN\u2014as the Executing Agency for the Project\u2014will monitor and \noversee  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  follow  the  sector  loan  approach,  and  the \nGovernment  has  delegated  the  approval  for  project  procurement  to  EVN  to  expedite \nimplementation. These measures are expected to reduce procurement time greatly and avoid \nthe delays experienced in the previous two projects. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The Project is to (i) strengthen the northern transmission network to improve system \nreliability  and  quality  of  supply,  (ii)  facilitate  power  transfers  by  removing  transmission \nbottlenecks, (iii) reduce transmission losses, and (iv) facilitate efficient utilization of existing and \nplanned power plants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The Project has two major components. Part A focuses on the construction, expansion \nand upgrading of the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, enabling the transfer of additional \npower to improve system reliability and enhance the efficient utilization of existing and new \npower plants in the north. Part B entails the construction, upgrading, and expansion of 500 kV \nand 220 kV substations. The construction of a new 500 kV/220 kV substation at Soc Son \nprovides a strategic link between generation plants in eastern (thermal) and western (hydro) \nparts of northern Viet Nam and industrial load centers in Hanoi and Haiphong. It also offers the \npotential for subsequent interconnection with the PRC. This will simplify load dispatch, and \nimprove system performance and system reliability. The candidate subprojects are described \nbriefly in Appendix 5. \n \n29.  Technical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection. The Institute of Energy \n(IOE)  carried  out  least-cost  generation  expansion  and  long-term  planning  studies  for  the \ncountry, using the integrated resource planning approach to ensure optimum use of the Viet \nNam\u2019s resources. Based on these studies, EVN and IOE formulated the power transmission \nexpansion network through exhaustive engineering design calculation. EVN and IOE employed \nstate-of-the\u2013art, commercially available power system simulation software packages to perform \n ", "8     \ndetailed  power  flow  studies,  short-circuit  calculations,  and  dynamic  and  transient  stability \nanalyses.  The  aim  was  to  ensure  a  robust,  yet  optimal,  transmission  network  based  on \ninternationally proven extra-high voltage alternating current transmission technology. \n \n30.  Subproject Selection. To be eligible for selection, a subproject should (i) be technically \nfeasible, (ii) be part of EVN's revised Fifth PDMP (or subsequent revision thereof), (iii) not be \nclassified  as  category  A,17  and  (iv)  not  include  transmission  lines  emanating  from  power \ngeneration stations. Based on available data and the eligibility criteria, ADB and EVN jointly \nappraised the three core subprojects in northern Viet Nam: (i) 269 kilometers (km) of double \ncircuit 500 kV transmission lines covering Son La\u2013Hoa Binh\u2013Nho Quan, (ii) 152 km of double \ncircuit 220 kV transmission lines covering Thanh Hoa\u2013Nghi Son\u2013Vinh, and (iii) expansion of the \nVan Tri 220 kV substation.  \n \n31.  Selection of addition subprojects after loan approval should satisfy the eligibility criteria \n(para. 30). Further, EVN will follow procedures that include (i) a technical feasibility study for \neach subproject, (ii) a resettlement plan (RP) that meets the requirements of the resettlement \nframework  (RF),  and  (iii)  an  environmental  assessment  that  follows  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedures specified in the initial environmental examination (IEE). The \ntechnical feasibility study will include a detailed engineering design of the subproject, including \nan  indication  that  this  is  the  least-cost  solution  among  the  alternatives,  cost  estimates, \nprocurement packaging, and an implementation schedule. For each subproject to be appraised, \nEVN will submit an appraisal report to ADB for approval. Appendix 6 provides the format for the \nsubproject appraisal report.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Subregional  Context.  Although  not  a  GMS  initiative,  the  Project  will  promote \ncooperation in the subregion. The 220 kV transmission line from Tuyen Quang to Yen Bai, \nscheduled for completion in 2009, would link with the Soc Son 500 kV/220 kV substation, \nplanned  for  completion  by  2009.  This  would  create  the  potential  for  robust  power \ninterconnection between Viet Nam and PRC in the future.  \n \n33.  Capacity Building. Based on policy dialogue with the Government (para. 22), EVN will \nstrengthen the environmental unit to work on resettlement issues. In addition, ADB has engaged \nthe Government in policy dialogue on the environment and social safeguard requirements of the \n2,600 MW Son La Hydropower Project (SLHPP) and 560 MW Huoi Quang Hydropower Project \n(HQHPP), which the Government and EVN are financing.18 The Government welcomed ADB\u2019s \nassistance in  strengthening  the capacity  of  MONRE  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and Rural \nDevelopment  (MARD)  to  address  environmental  and  resettlement  matters  under  the  two \nprojects, as well as sector-wide issues. In this context, three stand-alone advisory TAs are being \nformulated.  The  first  is  to  assist  EVN  in  strengthening  and  improving  the  Environmental \nManagement Plan (EMP) of the proposed SLHPP and HQHPP, and to build EVN\u2019s capacity for \nenvironmental management and watershed management through the implementation of EMPs \ninvolving multiple stakeholders. The second TA, with broader capacity building input, focuses on \nstrengthening  MONRE's  capability  in  cumulative  impact  assessment  and  strategic \n                                                 \n17  Category A are projects  with potential significant adverse environmental impacts. An environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) is required to address significant impacts. \n18  These two hydropower projects are estimated to cost $3 billion. The first unit (600 MW) of SLHPP will be \ncommissioned in late 2010, second unit in 2011, third and fourth units in 2012. HQHPP will be commissioned in \n2011. ", "    9 \nenvironmental assessment, mainly for the hydropower subsector. The third TA is to strengthen \nthe institutional capacity for formulating and implementing a comprehensive resettlement plan \nand livelihood programs for SLHPP. The capacity building will target (i) MARD; (ii) the provinces \nof Son La, Lai Chau, and Dien Bien; (iii) SLHPP; and (iv) local stakeholders. The enhanced \ncapacity will help the Government implement resettlement plans and livelihood programs for \nother power projects.  \n \n34.  Sector Loan. EVN\u2019s successful implementation of three World Bank projects and two \nADB projects, which supported Power Company 1, Power Company 2, and Power Company 3, \ndemonstrated its competence as an executing agency. A sector loan, therefore, is considered \nappropriate to finance a portion of EVN\u2019s investments over the next 5 years. With the sector \nloan approach, ADB can support EVN\u2019s initiatives to improve power system performance and \nfacilitate  further  sector  reform.  A  sector  loan  approach  will  internalize  the  selection  of \nsubprojects  that  meet  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  criteria \nappropriate to modernizing the power sector. The sector loan approach also will provide EVN \nwith sufficient flexibility to utilize ADB financing optimally. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n35.  The Project consists of two main components: Part A, with investments in 500 kV and \n220 kV transmission lines; and Part B, with investments in 220 kV and 500 kV substations. The \ncost estimates of the three core subprojects and additional subprojects to be implemented \nduring 2006\u20132010 are summarized in Table 1.

The Government has requested a loan of $360 million from ADB's OCR to help finance \nthe Project. The loan will have (i) a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; (ii) an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; (iii) a commitment charge of 0.75% per year; and (iv) such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement and Project Agreement. EVN has provided \nADB with the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility based \non  these  terms  and  conditions.  Further,  EVN  demonstrated  that  it  made  its  decision \nindependently, without relying on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n37.  ADB will finance 79.5% of the estimated project cost, including 100% of the foreign \nexchange  cost  (Table  2).  EVN  will  provide  $92.7 million  equivalent  in  local  currency  as \ncounterpart financing, which accounts for 20.5% of total costs. This will finance civil works, \nresettlement, consultancy, and taxes and duties.  \n \n38.  Although  commercial  cofinancing  is  not  envisioned,  cofinancing  from  commercial \nsources might be mobilized in the future to complement ADB financing for this sector. Such \ncofinancing  could  benefit  from  ADB  credit  enhancements,  including  ADB\u2019s  guarantee \ninstruments. These would be presented separately for Board consideration as they arise. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nFinancing Source  Exchange  Currency \nADB  226.2 133.8 360.0  79.5 \nEVN Counterpart Funding  0.0 92.7 92.7  20.5 \nTotal  226.2 226.5 452.7  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EVN = Electricity of Viet Nam. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n39.  EVN will be the executing agency responsible for overall implementation of the Project. \nThe Project will be implemented as a sector loan, and additional subprojects will be introduced \nduring implementation. The Government has agreed to delegate the authority for approving \nsubprojects to EVN. Once approved, these subprojects will be submitted to ADB for financing \nunder the Project. NPPMB and CPPMB, as the implementing agencies, will be responsible for \nthe day-to-day implementation of the 500 kV and 220 kV project substations and transmission \nlines. Adequately staffed project offices have been established in the Hanoi headquarters of \nNPPMB and CPPMB to supervise the Project. International consultants, working with qualified \ndomestic consultants, will assist NPPMB and CPPMB with environment management planning \nand implementation of resettlement plans.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  Project  implementation  will  start  in  2006  with  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  Bid \ndocuments for international competitive bidding (ICB) packages will be prepared concurrently ", "    11 \nwith technical designs to allow bid documents to be approved quickly. Delivery of equipment will \nbe  phased  to  suit  NPPMB\u2019s  and  CPPMB\u2019s  storage  capacities  and  capability  of  erection \ncontractors.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2010.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n41.  Equipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated at more \nthan $1 million, while international shopping will be used for contracts below $1 million. Civil \nworks will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) for contract values of up to $3 \nmillion; ICB will be used for contract values more than $3 million (Appendix 9). ADB will review \nand approve all subprojects, including those that have not been appraised yet. The relevant \nsections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all ADB-financed contracts during \nbidding. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  EVN will engage and finance about 300 person-months of domestic consultants for (i) \ndetailed technical design; (ii) bid preparation and procurement; (iii) construction supervision; (iv) \nimplementing the EMPs; (v) preparing and implementing the RPs; and (vii) socioeconomic \nimpact assessment, and project performance monitoring. \n \n43.  The ADB loan will finance two international consultants for a total of 10 person-months. \nThe  international  consultants  will  (i)  prepare  subproject  RPs;  (ii)  guide  and  supervise \nresettlement committees (RC); (iii) train staff of NPPMB, CPPMB, and RCs; and (iv) assist \nNPPMB in the preparation of IEE and environmental management. In addition, ADB will finance \n14  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  (i) periodically  monitor  compliance  with  the \napproved RPs by meeting with project-affected people, RCs, NPPMB, and other agencies as \nappropriate, including independent domestic resettlement monitoring consultants; (ii) monitor \ncompliance with approved EMP for the subprojects; and (iii) implement the gender strategy. \nNPPMB will recruit the international and domestic consultants as individuals in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 10. The Government requested advance action for recruitment of consultants to \nminimize  front-end  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  approved  early  recruitment,  and \ninformed the Government that this would not commit ADB to financing the consultants. \n \n5.  Advance Action \n44.  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  for  civil  works  on  18  August  2005  up  to  the \napproval of contract award, which covers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid \nevaluation for the civil works contract packages. It does not include awarding of contracts, \nhowever. The Government has been advised that approval of advance procurement does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001)  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guideline  for  Disbursement \nOperations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products (July 2002), both as amended from time to time. \n ", "12    \nSince most of the payments will be made for large contracts, direct payment and commitment \nprocedures will be used to withdraw the loan funds.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  EVN will prepare regular progress reports for the Project and submit them to ADB \nquarterly. The reports will include a description of physical progress, difficulties encountered, \nand a summary of financial accounts for the Project (i.e., project expenditures during the period, \nyear to date, and total to date). EVN will submit the progress reports to ADB within 1 month of \nthe end of the semiannual period. EVN will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within 6 \nmonths of the close of the financial year, EVN will submit annual audited project accounts and \nannual  audited  financial  statements  of  EVN.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be \nconsolidated for all of EVN\u2019s operations. The financial management systems and procedures of \nEVN were assessed and found to meet ADB\u2019s requirements (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n47.  EVN  will  continue  to  engage  independent  auditors  to  audit  its  annual  financial \nstatements and annual project accounts, with the memorandum on issues identified during the \naudit process. These will be submitted with the respective reports. As part of the harmonization \nof  procedures  of  external  funding  agencies,  the  standards  to  be  followed  in  auditing  and \nfinancial statements have been agreed upon with the World Bank. For future contracts and \nrevisions,  the  auditors\u2019  terms  of  reference  will  be  provided  to  ADB.  The  accounts  will  be \nprepared using International Accounting Standards, and the audit will be carried out using \nInternational Standards of Auditing. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on EVN\u2019s \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants,  and  indicate  the  details  of  the  calculation  for \nfinancial ratios in the covenants, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan and \nProject Agreements. \n \n8.  Anticorruption  \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the Government and \nEVN. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, ADB-financed contracts for the Project shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nEVN and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject. To prevent corruption, EVN will establish a supervisory body to prevent interference in \nthe bidding processes. EVN also will hold regular briefings between NPPMB and CPPMB \nmanagement and the local prosecutor\u2019s office, where warnings about, or information on, corrupt \npractices can be assembled and discussed, and appropriate actions taken. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  EVN will prepare progress reports and submit them to ADB semiannually. The reports \nwill provide a narrative of progress made during the period, changes in the implementation \nschedule, problems encountered, performance of the project implementation consultants, and \nthe work to be carried out in the next period. EVN will handle the performance monitoring, which \nwill  be  based  on  performance  indicators/targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. \n ", "    13 \n10.  Project Review \n50.  ADB  will  field  a  project  inception  mission  soon  after  loan  approval  to  initiate \nimplementation. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on the \nquarterly reports, and will meet with EVN, NPPMB, CPPMB, and the Government semiannually \nto  discuss  project  progress.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2\u20133  years  after  loan \neffectiveness. Representatives of ADB and EVN will take part in the review, allowing for any \nnecessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful project implementation and achievement \nof objectives. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of project \ncompletion. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n51.  The proposed Project comprises individual subprojects, including 500 kV and 220 kV \ntransmission  lines  and  a  series  of  220  kV/500  kV  substations. These  are  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector investment program to meet growing electricity demand in northern \nViet Nam. As these subprojects are not stand-alone investments, the economic and financial \nanalyses  were  based  on  the  least  cost  investment  program  in  power  generation  and \ntransmission for the northern region during 2007\u20132015. The economic and financial analyses \nare in Appendix 11. \n \n52.  The financial and economic viability was examined by comparing the costs and benefits \nof meeting demand growth from 2007 to 2030 under the \u201cwith\u201d investment program scenario \nand the \u201cwithout\u201d investment program scenario. The \u201cwithout\u201d investment program scenario \nassumes no investments in the north beyond 2007, but accounts for the possibility of meeting \ndemand until 2010 using the spare capacity of the system in 2007. The investment program for \nthe central and southern regions is assumed to continue. The point at which the demand would \nbe curtailed on the north\u2013south 500 kV line is reached when the incremental demand in the \nnorth is met by power flows from the south in the absence of additional investments in the north \nunder the \u201cwithout case\u201d. \n \n53.  The \u201cwith\u201d case assumes the planned investments will be made during the time-slice \n(2007\u20132015). It also assumes that any incremental sales at the end of the time slice would \nrequire additional investments. Hence, financial and economic benefits due to incremental sales \nafter 2015 are considered in the analysis. The economic and financial benefits, derived from \ncomparing the performance of the power sector under the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d investment \nscenarios, are mainly due to (i) higher sales; (ii) lower transmission losses; and (iii) lower fuel \ncost per unit as the generation and transmission system will be based on the least-cost planning \ncriteria under the \u201cwith\u201d scenario, creating an optimal plant mix. Incremental costs of the \u201cwith\u201d \ncase were evaluated in terms of capital expenditures in generation, load dispatch, transmission, \ndistribution to consumers, and the cost of energy purchased from IPPs. \n \nA.  Financial Analysis \n54.  The analysis was conducted for 2005\u20132030, when power plants built during 2004\u20132010 \nwould end their useful economic life. The financial evaluation of the investment program was \nundertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2004  prices.  The  cost  estimates  and  financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof foreign and domestic inflation, as well as for currency fluctuations. Incremental costs and \nbenefits attributable to the investment program during 2007\u20132015 were derived by comparing \nEVN under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \n ", "14    \nthe investment program, computed on an after-tax basis, is 14.1%. This compares favorably \nwith EVN\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for this period, which is 6.9% computed on \nan after-tax basis. When discounted at WACC, the proposed investment program has a net \npresent value (NPV) of D52.5 trillion. The investment program is considered financially viable \nand sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for each component and \nthe investment program overall are robust with (i) reduced sales growth of 12%\u20136%, (ii) 20% \nincrease in capital costs, (iii) 20% reduction in willingness to pay, (iv) no tariff increase in 2007, \nand (v) 20% increase in operational and maintenance cost.   \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n55.  The economic viability of the investment program was analyzed based on incremental \ncosts and benefits, as compared with the \u201cwithout\u201d investment scenario. The economic benefits \nof meeting incremental electricity demands were valued based on willingness to pay and tariffs \nfor each consumer category. A domestic price numeraire was used in the economic analysis, \nand a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 was applied to all costs and benefits valued at border \nprices. This shows that the investment program yields an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of more than 23.1%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with respect to key risks and \nassumptions. The result showed that the investment program is economically worthwhile even \nunder combined extreme adverse conditions. The risk analysis showed that the risk of project \nfailure  is  negligible  (Appendix  11).  In  addition,  a  distribution  analysis  was  carried  out  by \nallocating  the  difference  between  economic  and  financial  benefits  and  costs  to  different \nstakeholders to identify the economic impacts or distortions in the sector. The tariffs for different \nconsumer categories were compared with the relevant long-run marginal cost of supplying these \nconsumers to identify further the cross-subsidies and other distortions in the sector.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n56.  The poverty analysis for the Project identified issues and assessed impacts at the sector \nlevel, since identifying specific consumers was difficult. The share of households connected to \nthe grid was 88%, and the majority of the poor are connected. Connection rates in the project \nareas  ranged  from  75%  to  95%.  These  high  connection  rates  imply  that  investments  in \ntransmission will benefit poor consumers directly across the economy by improving quality of \nsupply and electricity services. Improved quality of services will reduce the cost of repair and \nrepurchase of appliances, as well as improve the quality of lighting. Higher quality of supply \nimplies  substantial  welfare  impacts  for  poor  households.  From  the  household  perspective, \nhowever, a reduction in electricity expenditure and increased value of leisure are significant. \nLower electricity expenditure releases household funds for food, health, and education. Most \nnew residential consumers are expected to be poor. The majority of benefits to the poor are \nexpected  to  come  from  increasing  demand  for  labor,  resulting  from  improved  services  to \nindustrial and commercial sectors in urban and semi-urban areas. The analysis indicates that \nthese sectors will grow substantially in the medium term. Remittances from migrant labor will \nincrease welfare and reduce vulnerability of rural households.  \n \nD.  Impacts \n \n57.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The two RPs prepared for the core subprojects \nwere based on a preliminary technical design. The transmission routes were realigned to avoid \ndensely populated areas and minimize resettlement impacts. The 40-meter wide transmission \nline corridor will require relocation of about 254 households, of which 43 do not have sufficient \nresidential land to rebuild their houses. Therefore, these households  will be provided  with ", "    15 \nanother plot of residential land within the commune. For the tower foundations, the number of \naffected households and level of impacts are not known, as the locations of the towers will not \nbe determined until the detailed design stage. The Summary Resettlement Framework and Plan \nis in Appendix 12. The full resettlement framework and resettlement plans are in Supplementary \nAppendixes B and C, respectively. \n \n58.  Satisfactory resettlement planning and implementation will mitigate adverse impacts. \nThis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, as well as \nthe RPs and the RF adopted for the Project. The objective is to improve, or at least restore, \nliving standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels of affected people. Special \nassistance will be provided to the severely affected and vulnerable people to help them improve \ntheir socioeconomic status. A gender analysis for the affected household is included in the \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 13. \n \n59.  Environment.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  sensitive.19  A  summary  IEE  was \nprepared, circulated to the Board, and uploaded to the ADB Web site on 10 August 2005. The \nIEE includes a section on the candidate subproject environmental assessment and review \nframework, with the environmental selection criteria. The sample substations and transmission \nline will not be in or traverse any environmentally sensitive areas. Land acquisition will create \nsome unavoidable impacts along the route of the two transmission lines, though anticipated \nimpacts are considered manageable with adequate mitigation measures. The IEE provides an \nEMP to reflect best practices, which will ensure that the contractors adequately monitor and \nmitigate the impacts. The contractors, under the supervision of EVN during construction, will \nimplement the EMP, which will be developed during the detailed design phase. Institutional \narrangements for conducting and monitoring the EMP also are provided in detail in the IEE. \nPublic consultations on project-related environmental issues have been carried out in each \nprovince, and will continue into the implementation phase of the Project. The Project will not \nconsider category A subprojects.  \n \n60.  Social and Gender. The Project will address capacity building at the grassroots level to \nincrease the role of the community in resettlement monitoring and implementation. The social \nand gender strategy in the Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix  13) \nincludes capacity building for commune and villages leaders (men and women), leaders of mass \norganizations, and members of affected households. The increased community participation will \nfacilitate  implementation  of  Government  decrees,20  which  aim  to  increase  the  role  of  the \ncommunity in supervising and monitoring investments made in the interest of the community. \nIncreased  capacity  at  the  community  level  will  ensure  its  role  in  commune  investment \nsupervisory  groups  and  grassroots  democracy  board.  Decree  80  specially  provides  the \ncommunity with opportunities to monitor the implementation and evaluate the results of the \ninvestment  decision,  including  environmental  impacts,  and  resettlement  activities.  The \nincreased  capacity  of  the  commune  leaders  and  mass  organizations  will  enable  effective \nimplementation of the RP\u2019s socioeconomic support program. The sexually transmitted disease \n                                                 \n19  Projects judged to have some advance environmental impacts, but of lesser degree of significance than those for \ncategory A projects. An initial environmental examination (IEE) is required to determine whether or not significant \nenvironmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the final \nenvironmental assessment report. \n20  Decree No. 79/2003/ND\u2013CP, issued on 7 July 2003, relates to Promulgating the Regulation on the Exercise of \nDemocracy in Communes. Decree No. 80/2005/ND-CP, issued on 22 June 2005, relates to Assignment, Sale, \nBusiness Contracting and Lease of State Companies. \n ", "16    \n(STD)/HIV/AIDS21  and  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  be  included  in  the  civil  works \ncontracts.  \n \n61.  Ethnic Minority. Ethnic minorities make up between 26% and 66% of the population in \nthe subproject areas. The majority lives in the area of the Son La\u2013Nho Quan transmission line. \nThe largest ethnic groups in the project area are the Muong and Thai, with smaller populations \nof H\u2019mong, Dao, Kho Mu, and Sinh Mun. The ethnic minorities live in mixed villages with Kinh \nhouseholds. Like the Kinh, they work in wetland agriculture. Social analysis shows that these \nethnic minorities are not any more vulnerable to the risks associated with resettlement and the \nspread of HIV/AIDS than Kinh households. Resettlement impacts will be mitigated through \nspecific measures in the RF, RP, and gender strategy prepared for the Project. The STD/HIV/ \nAIDS prevention and awareness programs in the civil works contracts will mitigate the health \nrisks. \n \nE.  Risks \n62.  Compensation, resettlement, and income restoration measures might not be delivered \nas agreed, thereby impoverishing affected people and delaying the start of civil works. NPPMB \nand CPPMB will have specialists to assist in implementing the RPs, and they will engage an \nindependent monitoring organization. \n \n63.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed  Project  depends  on  the \nimplementation of the other components of the power system\u2019s expansion in northern Viet Nam. \nThese include significant investments in new power generation capacity, as well as transmission \ncapacity outside the scope of the proposed Project. EVN and other public sector investors, as \nwell as the private sector, must make concerted efforts to mobilize financing and successfully \nimplement  these  projects.  EVN  and  the  Government  are  expected  to  create  the  enabling \nenvironment through proposed power sector reforms that remove entry barriers for third parties. \n \n64.  The  financial  projections  for  EVN  have  been  prepared  on  the  assumption  that \noperational efficiency gains, proceeds from equitization, and tariff increases will be implemented \nin a timely manner to ensure EVN\u2019s compliance with financial covenants. If the underlying \nassumptions on fuel cost, cost of power purchased from IPPs, and shift in the consumer mix \ndeteriorate from the assumed values, the required tariff increases would need to be adjusted. \nThe sensitivity of financial ratios used as financial covenants to the adverse movements of \nthese  assumptions  was  assessed.  This  is  especially  important  in  the  context  of  proposed \nreforms that would introduce limited competition in power generation under a single-buyer \nmarket structure. Establishing a regulatory body under the proposed Electricity Law with powers \nto set tariffs transparently on sound economic and financial grounds will mitigate this risk \nsignificantly. \n \n65.  Significant private investments in new projects, as well as in acquiring EVN-owned \npower plants (i.e., equitization), has been assumed. The financial proceeds from selling equity \nstakes also will make a significant contribution to EVN\u2019s cash flows. The assumption that the \neconomy will continue to grow at 7.5% is a potential concern. Slower economic growth would \nreduce the rate of growth in electricity demand. However, the analysis of risks shows that the \neconomic viability of the investment program would withstand extreme adverse changes in \nanticipated economic growth, and in other key risk factors and assumptions. \n                                                 \n21  HIV/AIDS means human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "    17 \n66.  The  risks  to  ADB  are  that  the  environment  and  social mitigation measures  for  the \nSLHPP and HQHPP will not be implemented effectively. Environmental and social due diligence \nfor the SLHPP and HQHPP was conducted. Its direct and cumulative impacts have been \nexamined to understand more fully the risks associated with the proposed Project. Summaries \nof the findings are in Appendix 14 and Appendix 15, while the full due diligence reports are in \nSupplementary Appendixes D and E.  \n  \n67.  The EMP for the SLHPP needs to be strengthened. ADB will provide assistance to EVN \nto improve and implement the EMP. EVN is committed to completing the environment impact \nassessments (EIA) process of the SLHPP and implementing its EMP, with monitoring reports \nregularly submitted to ADB for review. TA will be provided to EVN and MONRE to build their \ncapacity for cumulative and strategic environmental assessments to address sector-wide issues \nin the longer term. In addition, the resettlement planning and implementation of livelihood \nprograms for 95,000 people to be displaced by the Project is weak. A capacity building TA will \nhelp MARD and provincial RCs improve the planning and implementation of the sustainable \nlivelihood program for resettlers. \n \n68.  Health Risks. The Project will increase the potential for the spread of HIV/AIDs and \nother STDs due to the influx of workers during construction. This potential will be mitigated or \nminimized through a program to increase awareness and provide preventive measures for the \nlocal communities and the workforce. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Sector restructuring. The Government ensure that all EVN generation units \nexcept for the multipurpose power plants have been corporatized such that each \ngeneration  unit  (a) has  become  an  independent  unit,  including  independent \naccounting;  or  (b) has  become  a  single-member  limited  liability  company;  or \n(c) has been equitized such that ownership is held by EVN and one or more \nother investors.  \n \n(ii)  Financial  ratios  and  reporting.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  EVN  will \nachieve at all times a self-financing ratio of at least 25%, a debt service coverage \nratio of at least 1.5 times, and a long-term debt-equity ratio of at least 70:30 to \nensure operating efficiency and financial sustainability. EVN will (a) maintain an \ninternal audit function to undertake timely audit of project accounts in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles; and (b) submit to ADB its audited \naccounts and financial statements within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n(iii)  Anticorruption.

EVN will ensure that (a) funds needed for land \nacquisition and resettlement are allocated and disbursed in a timely manner; (b) \nthe RP is updated and submitted to ADB within 3 months of completing the \ndetailed  measurement  surveys;  and  (c)  ADB  is  promptly  advised  of  any \nsubstantial changes in the resettlement impacts and, if necessary, a revised RP \nis submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n \n(v)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  SLHPP  and  HQHPP.  For  these \nhydropower  projects,  the  Government  will  cause  MARD  and  the  provincial \nresettlement committees to carry  out the resettlement plans and sustainable \nlivelihood programs in compliance with Special Decision 459/2004 of the Prime \nMinister.  \n \n(vi)  Social unit. EVN will strengthen its Appraisal and Construction Management \nDepartment with additional staff to handle resettlement matters on a full-time \nbasis within 3 months of the date of project approval. The unit will be responsible \nfor  social  and  environmental  issues,  particularly  resettlement  planning  and \nmanagement,  ethnic  minority  development  planning  and  management, \nSTD/HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  and,  poverty  and  social  impact \nassessments.  \n \n(vii)  Environment.  EVN  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  subprojects  are  designed, \nconstructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the environmental \nlaws and regulations of the Government and the Environmental Policy of ADB; \n(b)  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  applied  for  each \nfuture candidate subproject prepared for submission to ADB for approval prior to \nsubproject approval; (c) the EMP and the mitigation measures included therein, \nas specified in the IEE prepared for the Project, are implemented properly; (d) for \na \u201cB\u201d sensitive subproject, a summary IEE will be prepared and made available \nto the general public at least 120 days before the subproject is approved; (e) no \ncategory \u201cA\u201d subprojects will be included in the Project for consideration; (f) any \nenvironmental permits, licenses, and clearances are obtained in a timely manner; \n(g) any adverse impact on the environment that may arise from the project \nimplementation activities is mitigated promptly or minimized in accordance with \nthe EMP; and (h) implementation of the EMP, including any safety breaches, ", "    19 \nviolation of environmental standards, and corrective measures taken thereto, is \nreported semiannually to ADB. \n \n(viii)  EMP for SLHPP and HQHPP. EVN will ensure that these hydropower projects \nare constructed and commissioned in compliance with laws and regulations of \nthe  Government.  EVN  will  implement  the  EMPs  for  SLHPP  and  HQHPP, \nincluding the downstream impacts management programs.    \n \n(ix)  Poverty reduction. EVN, through NPPMB, will ensure that civil works contracts \nwith  contractors  will  have  provision  to  maximize  employment  of  local  poor \npersons who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the \ntransmission lines and substations. Such workers will be provided adequate on-\nthe-job training.  \n \n(x)  Other  social  issues.

I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of  \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $360,000,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Expansion  Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n                      Haruhiko Kuroda \n                            President \n \n29 November 2005 \n \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Sector Overview \n1.  Viet Nam is well endowed with energy resources, comprising hydropower, natural gas, \npetroleum, coal, and biomass. The hydropower potential of the country is estimated to be \nbetween 50,000 and 70,000 megawatt (MW), though only 4,198 MW has been developed. An \nadditional 8,000 MW of hydropower is expected to be developed during 2005\u20132012. Viet Nam is \na net exporter of petroleum products, amounting to 150,000 barrels per day (bbl/day). Viet Nam \nalso  has  415  billion  cubic  meters  (cm3)  of  proven  reserves  of  natural  gas,  with  current \nproduction of 5 billion\u20137 billion cm3 per year. Proven coal reserves total 3.8 billion tons, with \ncurrent output of about 27 million tons per annum.  Power generation uses more than 90% of \nViet Nam\u2019s natural gas production and 4 million tons of coal per annum.  \n \n2.  Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN), formed in 1995, is a vertically integrated state-owned \ncorporation responsible for Viet Nam\u2019s power sector. EVN is organized as a strategic business \nunit  with  generation  units  (i.e.,  plants  with  a  capacity  of  more  than  60  MW)  and  power \ntransmission  (i.e.,  the  transmission  facilities  of  at  least  110  kilovolt  (kV))  as  dependent \naccounting units (i.e., cost centers), and power distribution as independent accounting units \n(i.e., profit centers). Three power companies (PC1, PC2, and PC3) are responsible for power \ndistribution in northern, southern, and central parts of the country. Four power distribution \ncompanies operate in four major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, and Dong Nai. The \nBoard of Management of EVN is responsible for overall business management, and has the \nauthority to approve the business plan of EVN, approve new investments, and procure items \nbelow limits set by the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Industry (MOI) is responsible for policy \nand oversight of the power sector. A separate regulatory body for the sector does not exist.  \n \n3.  The power generation mix in Viet Nam is summarized in the Table A1.1.  \n \nTable A1.1: Power Generation Mix in Viet Nam \nType of Plant  Available Capacity  Of which IPP  \n(MW)  (MW) \nHydro           4,228  0     \nCoal           1,255  100   Vina Coal \nNatural Gas            4,460  1,435   Phu My 2.2 and Phu My3 \nFurnace Oil                682  497   Hiep Phuoc and Nomura \nDiesel              246  0   \n  Total         10,871  2,032   \n        IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt. \n     Source: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n  \n4.  EVN\u2019s transmission network consists of a 500 kilovolt (kV) single circuit backbone line \nfrom north to south, and 220 kV and 110 kV network connecting the load centers and most of \nthe power plants. The larger power complexes are directly connected to the 500 kV network. \nThe north\u2013south 500 kV transmission link is being converted to double circuit, while two 500 kV \nrings are planned in the north and south to connect the proposed large power plants to the load \ncenters. The ongoing transmission augmentation aims mainly to complete the 500 kV and 220 \nkV ring, and upgrade the 220 kV/500 kV substations around Hanoi, Hai Phong, and Ho Chi \nMinh City to meet the rising demand.   \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \n5.  The power companies purchase bulk power from EVN at administratively fixed bulk \npower tariffs at the 110 kV level or at medium voltage (i.e., 35 kV and 22 kV). EVN sets the bulk \nprice tariffs to enable each power company to achieve a reasonable profit irrespective of its cost \nstructure. The power companies directly supply electricity to industrial, commercial, and other \nconsumers  and  the  residential  consumers  in  urban  areas.  By  the  end  of  2004,  95%  of \ncommunes and 88% of households had access to electricity, compared with 62% of communes \nand 50% of households in 1995. Under Viet Nam\u2019s unique approach to rural electrification, EVN \nprovides a medium-voltage connection to the commune center, and the local community and \nthe households mobilize funds to install and operate the low-voltage grid. The low-voltage grids \nare designed poorly and have high distribution losses (up to 20%\u201330%), which the national \nsystem loss figures do not capture. The end-user tariffs in rural areas, which are not regulated \nnationally, range from D700 to D900 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (i.e., $0.044\u2500$0.056/kWh)\u2014two to \nthree times the urban residential tariffs.  \n \n6.  Electricity generation in Viet Nam has grown at annual compounded rate of 13.7% \nduring  1995\u20132004.  Since  2000,  the  annual  growth  rate  has  exceeded  14.9%.  Electricity \ngeneration doubled from 23.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1999 to 46.2 TWh in 2004. With gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  forecasted  to  grow  faster  than  7.5%  a  year  for  2005\u20132010,  and \nindustrial  output\u2019s  share  of  GDP  increasing,  the  rise  in  electricity  demand  is  expected  to \ncontinue. Electricity use in Viet Nam is growing from a very low base for a country of its size. In \n1995, power sales of 11,185 gigawatt-hour (GWH) amounted to only 156 kWh per person per \nyear. Even after electricity use grew more than threefold during 1996\u20132004, total end-use \nconsumption amounted to only about 500 kWh per capita per year.   \n \n7.  The operational and financial performance of EVN has improved consistently over the \npast  5  years.  The  transmission  and  distribution  losses  were  reduced  to  12.2%  in  2005, \ncompared with more than 21% in 1995, and the receivables are maintained at around 20 days. \nThe average tariff at around $0.052/kWh is below the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), which is \nestimated to be around 7.5 cents/kWh. Still, the self-financing ratio and debt service coverage \nratio have been maintained within the prudential limits without explicit fiscal subsidies. The \nincreased borrowing requirement of the sector to finance the large capital investment program \nwill require further improvements in internal cash generation of the sector. The average tariff will \nhave to be increased to $0.06/kWh by 2010. The Government also intends to mobilize a \nsignificant portion of the resources required for new investments by divesting (i.e., equitization) \npower assets. The proposed power market is expected to provide investors in divested power \nplants, as well as in greenfield power plants, adequate comfort without resorting to explicit \nGovernment guarantees.  \n \nB.  Sector Reforms  \n8.  The power sector policy, as enunciated in the new Electricity Law, is to develop a power \nmarket on the principles of transparency and competition to (i) achieve economic efficiency, (ii) \nattract state and nonstate investors to the sector, and (iii) ensure the legitimate rights of the \nconsumers and investors in the sector. Further, the new law states that the Government\u2019s \nmonopoly in the sector would be limited to power transmission, national load dispatch, and \nstrategically important large power plants. Power distribution and nonstrategic power generation \nwill be open to private investors. The law specifically encourages foreign private investments, \nand joint ventures between foreign investors and domestic enterprises in the power sector. To \nachieve these objectives, MOI is responsible for establishing a competitive power market for \nViet Nam.    \n \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n9.  The  Road  Map  for  Electricity  Market  Establishment  and  Development,  which  MOI \nprepared, envisages the corporate restructuring of EVN to establish the necessary conditions \nfor initiating the first stage of the power market. The first stage entails establishing an internal \npilot market for EVN-owned power plants and the power plants in which EVN holds a dominant \nshare. The independent power producers (IPPs) and three strategic multipurpose hydropower \nplants will not take part in the internal market. The IPPs will be dispatched according to the \npower purchase agreements (PPA). During the first stage, the following will be developed and \npiloted: (i) market rules; (ii) regulatory, technical, and commercial institutions; and (iii) capacity \nrequired for operating the second phase (2008\u20132010) of the proposed power market (i.e., single \nbuyer-based competitive generation market with the participation of non-EVN power plants). \nThe EVN internal power market is expected to start in late 2005, with competitive generation \nmarket beginning in 2009.  \n \n10.  EVN-owned power plants would be converted into independent accounting units (i.e., \nprofit centers), and some would be equitized (i.e., partially privatized). However, the three large \nmultipurpose hydropower projects with a combined capacity of 3,000 MW (30% of installed \ncapacity) would be retained as dependent units of EVN. As the first step in the equitization \nprogram, a 135 MW hydropower plant and a provincial distribution utility were equitized (i.e., \npartially privatized with more than 51% equity stake retained by EVN). Two other power plants, \nincluding the 1,000 MW Pha Lai coal power plant, are expected to be equitized by the end of \n2005. The equitization of five more power plants and 15 provincial distribution utilities has been \nproposed for 2006, and EVN\u2019s ownership in the equitized entities would be reduced to 51%\u2013\n60%.  \n \n11.  The four transmission units, which are structured as dependent units of EVN, would be \nmerged to form a wholly owned EVN subsidiary to own and operate the transmission network. \nEVN\u2019s stakes in the equitized provincial distribution utilities would be held through the seven \nregional  power  companies.  These  regional  power  companies  would  be  converted  from \nindependent accounting units to wholly owned subsidiaries of EVN. The provincial distribution \nutilities will be equitized, with the regional power companies holding EVN\u2019s equity stake in the \nutilities.  A  market-based  transfer  pricing  mechanism  will  replace  the  administratively  fixed \ntransfer  pricing  between  EVN\u2019s  transmission  unit  and  the  regional  power  companies.  The \nprovincial power utilities supplying rural and mountainous provinces will be provided with an \nexplicit and transparent subsidy funded through a universal service charge. EVN\u2019s corporate \nrestructuring program is expected to be completed by 2008. \n \n12.  The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) for the power sector would be established as \na separate institution within the MOI. The key functions of ERA during the first and second \nstages include (i) issuing and enforcing licenses to sector entities; (ii) advising the minister on \nmarket structure and industry restructuring policy; (iii) establishing the principals for setting \ntariffs, including transfer pricing between sector entities; (iv) developing tariffs for regulated \nactivities; (v) approving power purchase agreements of the single buyer; (vi) ensuring the \nprocurement  of  adequate  new  generation  and  transmission  capacity;  (vii)  monitoring  the \nprogress of implementation of new generation and transmission projects; and (viii) monitoring \nthe functioning of power market. The law does not clearly define the enforcement mechanism of \nregulatory  actions,  though  the  official  decision  establishing  the  regulator  would  clarify  the \nenforcement powers of ERA. \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nC.  Sector Focus  \n \n13.  Socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth is a pillar of Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB\u2019s)  country  strategy  for  Viet  Nam.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  success  is \nreducing poverty and improving the living conditions of its population was based on rapid and \nequitable economic growth, underpinned by a transition to a market-based economy with strong \nlinks to global markets. The competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy, especially the industrial \nsector,  depends  on  the  availability  of  cheap  and  reliable  electricity.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment has indicated its desire to borrow from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) for \nrevenue-earning investment projects. The first OCR-funded project was approved in 2004. \nSimilarly, future ADB investments in the power sector would be financed by OCR. Viet Nam has \nnot indicated interest in obtaining public sector ADB financing or technical assistance (TA) for \nnon-power  energy  subsectors,  such  as  coal,  natural  gas,  and  oil.  However,  the  proposed \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Energy Sector Strategy would provide an opening for ADB to \nengage the Government on policy dialogue aimed at shared development and regional trading \nof Viet Nam\u2019s fossil fuel resources.   \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s involvement in the power sector has been limited to financing power transmission \nand distribution projects, and providing TA for power reforms and commercialization of power \nentities. Given the high electrification rate of Viet Nam and the availability of $450 million in \nfinancing from World Bank\u2019s Rural Energy I and II Projects, the financing gap in the power \ndistribution sector is small. Further, the financial return from the remaining rural electrification \ninvestments does not justify financing through OCR. Hence, future ADB investments in the \npower sector will be focused on power generation and transmission. ADB has a comparative \nadvantage in expanding the scope of engagement to financing environmentally sustainable \npower  generation,  and  high-voltage  transmission  lines  linking  Viet  Nam  with  other  GMS \ncountries. The institutional capacity building program envisaged under the GMS Regional Power \nTrading  Coordination  Committee  would  offer  additional  opportunities  to  assist  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  GMS  power  grid.  As  ADB  has  committed  substantial  resources  to  the \nexpansion of the 500 kV transmission network in Viet Nam through Loan 2128-VIE1 and the \nproposed Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project, future ADB investments in \nthe transmission will concentrate on establishing the critical transmission links in the proposed \nGMS power network. This includes the proposed Viet Nam\u2013Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2013\nThailand 500 kV transmission line, and the Viet Nam\u2013People\u2019s Republic of China 500 kV \ntransmission  line.  TA  for  the  former  is  being  implemented,  while  the  latter  is  being \nconceptualized.  \n \n15.  ADB financing for the national projects in Viet Nam\u2019s power sector during 2007\u20132010 \nprobably will be focused on power generation, which requires large investments. The first would \nbe the 155 MW Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project, which is being prepared. The Government\u2019s \nstrategy in power generation is to undertake large hydropower projects with storage (i.e., more \nthan 100 MW) as public sector projects. Small hydropower projects are offered to domestic \ninvestors to be implemented as IPPs. The medium-size thermal power projects (i.e., less than \n300 MW) are implemented as IPPs by domestic investors, mainly state-owned enterprises such \nas Vina Coal or joint ventures between EVN and other domestic enterprises. The Government is \nalso keen to develop large thermal complexes with installed capacity of more than 1,500 MW as \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The investment loans to be financed with OCR must be coupled with policy dialogue to \nimprove the social and environmental sustainability of Viet Nam\u2019s power generation expansion \nprogram. These will be addressed through targeted TAs to sector entities, as well as to national \nand provincial enforcement agencies, to improve the capacity to deal with adverse impacts of \nsome of these power generation projects.

Introduction \n \n1.  Since being established in 1995 as a vertically integrated entity responsible for the \nelectricity sector in Viet Nam, Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) has been profitable. EVN has \nfinanced  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Viet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  sector  without  significant  fiscal \nsubsidies. The key financial performance indicators, such as debt service cover ratio, self- \nfinancing ratio, and receivables, have been maintained at prudential limits. Meanwhile, the \naverage end-user tariff has been maintained at around D794/kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.051/kWh). \nAlthough the average tariff level is less than the estimated long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of \nD1,142/kWh ($0.071/kWh), the prevailing tariffs are adequate to maintain the financial viability \nof the sector. However, to satisfy future demand resulting from rapid economic growth, EVN will \nneed to make considerable investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. As a \nsubstantial portion of these investments will be debt financed, sustained tariff increases are \nrequired to maintain adequate levels of debt service and self-financing of new investments.       \n \nB.  Historical Performance  \n \n2.  EVN's electricity sales (Table A3.1) doubled between 1999 and 2004, representing an \nannual growth rate of 15.2%. Although the average tariffs, net of sales taxes, increased only \nmarginally from D660/kWh ($0.0475/kWh) in 1999 to D794/kWh ($0.051/kWh) by 2004, the \ncash flow from operating activities rose from D5,882 billion ($427 million) to D13,454 billion \n($857 million) in that same period. Further, EVN\u2019s net profit reached D3,576 billion ($227 \nmillion) in 2004, compared with D1,088 billion ($79 million) in 1999.

During 1999\u20132004, EVN\u2019s cumulative capital investments totaled D74.1 trillion ($4.9 \nbillion), and its debt service was D17.1 trillion ($1.1 billion). These investments were financed \nthrough cash flows from operations, totaling D49.9 trillion ($3.3 billion); borrowings of D42.2 \ntrillion ($2.8 billion); and capital injections of D1.3 trillion ($90 million). The heavier borrowing ", "  Appendix 3  27 \nincreased EVN\u2019s debt-equity ratio from 41:59 in 1999 to 55:45 in 2004, and reduced the debt \nservice cover ratio from 4.8 to 3.1. Still, with its strong growth in future cash flows and low initial \ngearing, EVN retains the capacity to absorb further borrowings to finance its investments.       \n \nC.  Historical Covenant Compliance \n \n4.  In the two recent ADB loans to EVN (Loans 1358-VIE and 1585-VIE),1 EVN committed \nthat three of its power distribution companies (PC1, PC2, and PC3) would maintain certain \nfinancial ratios to ensure the sustainability of ADB's investments. These included a minimum \nself-financing ratio (SFR) of 30%, a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5, and a rate of \nreturn (ROR) on net fixed assets of 12%. In addition, EVN committed to ADB to (i) increase its \naverage retail tariffs in phases, reaching the equivalent of $0.07/kWh by 1999; (ii) maintain the \nratio of the average residential tariff to the average retail tariff; and (iii) maintain the bulk tariffs \nthat EVN charges the PCs, and not allow them to decline as a percentage of retail tariffs. While \nthe PCs generally complied with the SFR and DSCR ratios, they regularly fell short on the ROR \ncovenant.  As  the  PCs  were  generally  profitable,  although  below  the  12%  threshold,  this \ncovenant was not enforced strictly.     \n \n5.  EVN generally complied with the covenants on the average level of residential tariffs and \nbulk tariffs compared with average retail tariffs. However, EVN was unable to get Government \napproval to raise its average retail tariffs to $0.07/kWh level, as EVN had been complying with \nthe financial ratio covenants. In 2001, the World Bank, ADB, and the Government met and \nagreed on a new schedule of tariff increases to raise retail tariffs to $0.07/kWh by July 2005.  \nWhile the first step of the tariff increases was implemented in October 2002 to improve the \naverage tariff to D789/kWh ($0.051/kWh), the schedule was not maintained after that.    \n \n6.  For  these  reasons,  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  the  Government  have  agreed  to  move \nforward in implementing the new financial covenants based on EVN\u2019s consolidated results (not \nwith the PCs); and EVN's overall financial viability and performance, rather than arbitrarily \nsetting tariff levels in foreign currency. The covenants included in the recently approved Loan \nVIE - 21282 are (i) self-financing ratio of 25%, (ii) debt service ratio of 1.5, and (iii) debt-equity \nratio of 70:30. EVN has complied with these ratios for 2004, as shown in Table A3.1. \n \nD.  Financial Projections (2004\u20132010)  \n \n  1.  Sales Growth \n \n7.  Although EVN\u2019s corporate structure is envisaged to change under the proposed power \nreforms, EVN is likely to remain a holding company with significant ownership of the operating \nsubsidiaries.  Electricity  sales  are  assumed  to  reach  88\u201399  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  in  2010, \ncompared with 39.2 TWh in 2004. That represents an annual growth rate of 15%\u201316% during \n2005\u20132010. The energy losses are expected to be maintained around the current levels of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

EVN also is expected to purchase 35 TWh from third parties (i.e., private power \nproducers and joint venture companies) out of the total generation of 100\u2013112 TWh in 2010.  \n \n8.  The aggregate financial projections of EVN and key financial ratios for 2005\u20132010 are \nshown in Table A3.2. These projections do not capture the cost of power shortages (i.e., loss of \nsales and use of expensive emergency measures to meet the demand) from May to July 2005 \nin northern Viet Nam. As a result, the actual financial performance of EVN in 2005 might turn \nout to be worse than the projected figures. The shortages are expected to continue in 2006 and \n2007 due to higher-than-expected growth in demand, as well as delays in commissioning power \nplants now under construction.  \n \nTable A3.2:  Financial Performance of EVN 2005\u20132010 \n(D billion) \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nTotal Revenue  40,913  46,524  58,290  66,189  75,058  85,103 \nRevenue From Electricity Sales  37,243  42,346  53,106  60,294  68,361  77,493 \nElectricity Sales GWh  45,944  51,568  57,864  64,831  72,564  81,201 \nAverage Tariff D/kWh  811  821  918  930  942  954 \nProfit Before Interest and Tax  4,582  6,939  10,719  12,071  14,534  9,465 \nNet Profit  1,956  3,441  5,547  6,028  6,538  2,458 \n             \nCash flow From Operations  14,193  17,991  22,335  26,840  31,784  31,363 \nNew Borrowings   17,680  21,840  31,313  36,676  39,016  42,053 \nCapital Injections  831  1,072  1,427  1,317  960  1,026 \nInvestments   30,455  37,258  45,010  44,587  45,291  49,662 \nDebt Service  5,263  6,923  9,914  12,772  18,036  22,084 \nEquitization  Proceeds    2,297  1,629  2,369  2,426   \n             \nSelf-Financing Ratio  32.0%  32.2%  34.5%  32.8%  33.3%  36.4% \nDebt Service Cover Ratio  2.9  2.8  2.5  2.1  1.8  1.6 \nDebt-Equity Ratio  60:40  63:37  66:34  69:31  70:30  73:27 \nEVN = Electricity of Viet Nam, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Electricity of Viet Nam. \n \n  2.  Tariffs \n \n9.  The financial projections assume that EVN\u2019s average tariff would increase to ensure \ncompliance with the financial covenants (para. 6). This would be 1.3% per year due to the \nchange in the consumer mix (i.e., increase in the share of consumption by commercial and \nindustrial consumers at the expense of residential consumers). This assumption is based on the \ndemand forecast for different consumer categories, and higher industrial and commercial tariffs \nrelative to residential tariffs. The Government also is assumed to approve an average tariff \nincrease of 10.5% (i.e., in addition to the increase in average tariff due to shift in the consumer \nmix) in 2006 to meet minimum debt service coverage and self-financing ratios.3 This would \nresult  in  an  average  tariff  of  D918/kWh  ($0.056/kWh)  by  2007,  compared  with  D794/kWh \n($0.051/kWh) in 2004. Given the rapid demand growth, and the investment required to maintain \nthe growth momentum of the economy, the Government has indicated that reasonable tariff \nincreases will be allowed during 2005\u20132010. \n \n                                                 \n3  In light of the power shortages in early 2005, the Government has asked EVN to submit a tariff increase schedule \nin early 2006 for consideration. ", "  Appendix 3  29 \n10.  EVN does not receive any explicit financial fiscal subsidies from the Government. The \ncoal prices are administratively fixed by the government, and the financial projections were \nmade based on coal prices staying at about $22 per ton during 2005\u20132010. Although these \nprices are below international coal prices, EVN\u2019s uses poor quality coal that is not directly \ncomparable with the international prices. The absence of data on the production cost of different \ntypes of coal, and the lack of transparency in Viet Nam\u2019s coal market, makes identifying any \nimplicit subsidy to EVN through coal prices difficult.  \n \n  3.  Capital Expenditures \n \n11.  EVN is to make cumulative capital investments totaling to D252 trillion ($16 billion) \nduring  2005\u20132010  period,  compared  with  D74  trillion  ($4.9  billion)  during  1999\u20132004\u2014a \nthreefold increase in capital investment. The debt service commitment during 2005\u20132010 will \nalso increased to D75 trillion ($4.5 billion), compared with D17 trillion ($1.1 billion) in the \nprevious 6-year period. In addition to the direct investments, EVN also is planning to form joint \nventure companies to implement some of the power generation projects in 2005\u201320010, and \nplans to invest D7.6 trillion ($465.0 million) in these companies. These joint ventures also would \nmobilize debt financing of approximately D31,000 billion ($2.0 billion). Investments mainly in \npower generation by non-EVN entities, including the private sector, would complement EVN\u2019s \ndirect investments and investments through the joint ventures. \n  \n12.     Although  EVN\u2019s  internal  cash  generation  is  projected  to  reach  D144.5  trillion  ($8.6 \nbillion) during 2005\u20132010, D188.6 trillion ($11.2 billion) in borrowings would finance the bulk of \nthe investments. This indicates significantly heavier borrowing compared with 1999\u20132004, when \nEVN borrowed D42.2 trillion ($2.8 billion). Without significant equity injections, this investment \nplan would substantially increase EVN\u2019s debt and its debt service requirements. The debt-equity \nratio would increase to 73:27 in 2010 from 55:45 in 2004, while the debt service requirements \nwould rise to D22.1 trillion ($1.4 billion) in 2010 from D4,503 trillion ($285 million) in 2004. As a \nresult, the DSCR would drop to 1.6 by 2010 from 3.1 in 2004. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s \ntransition from a lightly geared utility, due to its lack of access to debt financing before 1995, to \na more typical utility in a fast-growing economy.       \n \n13.  The Government has approved the plan for EVN to equitize (i.e., partially privatize) \nminority stakes in some power generation plants. The proceeds from these sales are not \nincluded in the cash flow projections, and are not used in the computation of the SFR and \nDSCR ratios. As of June 2005, the 130 megawatt (MW) Vinh Son\u2013Song Hinh hydropower plant, \na provincial power distribution utility, and 15 noncore businesses had been equitized. By the \nend of 2006, seven power plants and 15 power distribution utilities are expected to be equitized. \nThe liabilities of the equitized entities are transferred to the equitized entity, and the par value is \ncomputed net of the liabilities. The cash proceeds from the equitization will improve the cash \nflow-based financial ratio. However, the debt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not \nbe affected as EVN intends to hold a majority stake in the equitized entities. The liabilities of \nnew power plants to be developed as joint ventures between EVN and other parties are not \nconsolidated in the financial projections (Table A3.2), as the ownership structures of these joint \nventures have not been finalized.    \n \n4.  Proposed Covenants \n \n14.  Given the increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-term debt-equity ratio of 70:30 and \na minimum DSCR of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to ensure EVN\u2019s debt level and its \ndebt  service  capacity  remains  within  prudential  limits.  Although  the  debt-equity  position  is \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nsteadily increasing and DCSR is decreasing, they will remain within these limits during the \nforecast period, except in 2010 when debt-equity ratio will exceed 70:30. A minimum SFR of \n25% also must be included to ensure that EVN is generating adequate cash flows to finance a \nreasonable portion of the capital investments to keep the company's leverage within prudential \nlimits.  These  covenants  were  included  in  Loan  2128-VIE,  approved  in  2004,  and  EVN \ncomfortably complied with them in 2004. However, in the absence of the 10% increase in \naverage tariffs in 2006, EVN is unlikely to meet the covenant on a minimum SFR of 25%.   \n \n  5.   Conclusion \n \n15.  Despite its ambitious capital expansion program and relatively low tariffs, EVN appears \ncapable of maintaining its financial viability in the medium term with a modest tariff increase in \n2006. The financial projections assume EVN will continue to purchase coal at $22\u2013$25 per \nmetric ton, and that natural gas prices will increase at 2% per year. Any moves to link natural \ngas prices to crude oil prices would affect the financial viability of the sector significantly. \nFinancial performance covenants have been set on this basis to ensure financial viability, while \nalso providing EVN with enough financial flexibility to adjust in the short term as necessary. As \nshown in Table A3.2, compliance with the financial covenants is projected over the forecast \nperiod. However, if revenue stops growing in line with these assumptions, or the subsidies on \nfuel prices are removed, further increases in retail tariffs will be required to maintain compliance \nwith the covenants. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  31 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n

Macroeconomic and Sector Context \n1.  Viet Nam has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies during the past 5 \nyears.  Supported by buoyant consumption and investment, economic growth remained rapid \nrate in 2004, reaching 7.5%. Industry and services accounted for nearly 80% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), and were the main sources of growth. These two sectors grew 10.2% and 7.4%, \nrespectively, while agricultural expanded by 2.8%. The average inflation for 2004 was 7.7%, up \nfrom 3.2% in 2003. Broad-based economic growth has increased broad money supply and \ncredit by 28% and 36%, respectively. The fiscal deficit was maintained at 3.8%, below the \nGovernment\u2019s target of 5%. The fiscal position is expected to continue to expand, though within \nmanageable limits, to cover the investments in infrastructure and adjustment costs of structural \nreforms. The average economic growth for 2005\u20132007 is expected to be 7.5%\u20138.0%. The key \ndevelopment challenges for Viet Nam are to sustain the economic growth and reduce inequality \nthrough targeted poverty reduction. To increase the competitiveness and maintain GDP growth \nof at least 7.5%, Viet Nam needs to maintain an investment level of 35% of GDP, mainly to \ndevelop the physical infrastructure. \n \n2.  The key challenge facing Viet Nam\u2019s power sector is maintaining adequate investments \nto meet the rapid growth in demand for electricity. The Fifth Master Plan, revised in March 2003, \nstates that the total investment requirement of the power sector needs an estimated $17.5 \nbillion for 2004\u20132010, consisting of $13.0 billion for generation and $4.5 billion for transmission \nand distribution. The internal cash generation of the sector will provide half of the funding \nrequirement with borrowings (i.e., overseas development assistance, as well as export credit), \nwith  investments  from  non-sector  entities,  including  private  sector,  filling  the  balance.  The \noperational and financial performance of EVN has improved consistently during the past 5 \nyears. The average tariff at around $0.052/kilowatt-hour (kWh) is below the long-run marginal \ncost (LRMC), which is estimated at around $0.075/kWh). However, the self-financing ratio and \ndebt service coverage ratio have been maintained within the prudential limits without explicit \nfiscal subsidies. The heavier borrowing required by the sector to finance the large capital \ninvestment program will require improvement in the internal cash generation of the sector.  \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s demand for electricity has grown 14.2% per annum during 1990\u20132003. The \ngrowth rate increased to 15.2% during 1999\u20132004, with electricity sales rising to 39.7 terawatt-\nhour (TWh) in 2004 from 19.5 TWh in 1999. The demand growth was driven by (i) rapid broad-\nbased growth in industrial and commercial sectors, (ii) increase in electrification from less than \n40% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2004, (iii) urbanization, and (iv) higher living standards with \ndomestic demand growing at 19%. The demand has grown in all three regions of the country at \nroughly similar rates. However, Viet Nam\u2019s per capita consumption, at around 500 kWh, is \nrelatively low compared with neighboring countries, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  and  Thailand.  The  electricity  demand  elasticity  to  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be \nmaintained at 1.9 due to the energy-intensive nature of Viet Nam\u2019s industry-led economic \ngrowth. Given forecasted economic growth of 7% for 2005\u20132015, this translates into electricity \ndemand growth of 13%, which is lower than the growth rate in recent times. The electricity \ndemand and the peak demand are expected to rise from 39.7 TWh and 8,400 megawatt (MW), \nrespectively, in 2004 to 84.5 TWh and 17,000 MW in 2010, and 139.2 TWh and 26,900 MW in \n2015. The system losses would be reduced from 14.7% in 2004 to 13.8% in 2010 and 12.3 % in \n ", "44  Appendix 11 \n2015, while the load factor will improve from 65.7% in 2004 to 68.4% in 2010 and 69.1% in \n2015.    \n \nC.  Economic Rationale \n \n4.  The Government is committed to establishing a wholesale electricity market in Viet Nam \nwith competition in power generation. Except for the few multipurpose power plants, all the other \npublic sector power plants will be equitized (i.e., partially privatized) and will take part in the \nproposed power market. However, power transmission will remain within the public sector due \nto its monopolistic nature, the strategic importance of maintaining the security of the power \nsupply, and the necessity to ensure comparable conditions for competing power plants. The \ntransmission business of Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) will be consolidated as a separate \nbusiness unit, which will be regulated economically under the proposed electricity regulator. The \ncontinued public sector investments in power transmission is justified based on the importance \nof power transmission to meet the power demand and its high economic return, though the \nfinancial return is moderate due to the difficulties of pricing network services.  \n \nD.  Least Cost Analysis \n5.  The locations of new power plants and the high growth load centers drive the expansion \nof the power transmission system. The power generation expansion program for Viet Nam was \ndeveloped using a least-cost expansion planning algorithm (WASP III) under the Fifth Master \nPlan in 2000, which was updated in 2003 to account for the increase in projected demand \ngrowth. The algorithm minimizes the discounted sum of capital and operating cost by selecting \nthe optimum generation plant mix. The underlying assumptions in the optimization program for \nfuel cost and capital cost of candidate power plants, and types of candidate power plants \nconsidered, are reviewed and found to be reasonable. The transmission planning aims to \nconnect the selected power plants in the least-cost generation expansion plan with the load \ncenters at the least cost (taking into account transmission losses and capital cost) subject to \npower system security and stability constraints. The operating voltage and the capacity of \ntransmission  lines  are  selected  using  least-cost  planning  criteria,  while  the  locations  and \ncapacities of substations are selected to deliver the power to load centers at the least cost. The \nanalysis has shown that 500 kilovolt (kV) is the least-cost voltage for transmitting power from \nproposed large hydropower projects in northern Viet Nam to the load centers in Hanoi.  \n \nE.  Economic Benefit- Cost Analysis \n6.  The  proposed  sector  loan  comprises  individual  subprojects,  including  a  500 kV \ntransmission  line  and  a  series  of  substations,  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector \ninvestment  program,  to  meet  growing  electricity  demand  in  the  northern  region.  As  these \nindividual subprojects are not stand-alone investments, the economic and financial analyses \nwere conducted using a macro time-slice approach for the northern region investment program. \nThe investment program, which analyzed the period from 2007 to 2015, is based on the least-\ncost expansion plan for generation and transmission.     \n \n7.  The financial and economic viability was examined by comparing the costs and benefits \nof meeting demand growth from 2007 to 2030 under the \u201cwith\u201d investment program scenario \nand  a  \u201cwithout\u201d  investment  program  scenario.  The  \u201cwithout\u201d  scenario  assumes  that  no \ninvestments will be made in the north beyond 2007, though it accounts for the possibility of \nmeeting demand until 2010 utilizing the spare capacity of the system in 2007. This will be at a \nlower  reliability  due  to  the  probable  increased  loss  of  load  and  transmission  losses.  The ", "Appendix 11  45 \n \ninvestment program for the central and southern regions is assumed to continue. The point at \nwhich the demand would be curtailed was determined by undertaking power system studies \nuntil the transmission capacity on the north\u2013south 500 kV line is exceeded. The incremental \ndemand in the north would be met by power flows from the south in the absence of additional \ninvestments  in  the  north  under  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case.  This  was  found  to  be  the  point  when \nmaximum demand in northern power system reaches 5,447 MW in 2010.  \n \n8.  The \u201cwith\u201d case assumes that the planned investments will be made during the time slice \n(i.e., 2007\u20132015). Further, it assumes that at the end of the time slice, any incremental sales \nwould require further investments. Hence, financial and economic benefits due to incremental \nsales after 2015 (i.e., at this point the maximum demand in the northern power system would \nhave reached 8,540 MW) would not be considered in the analysis. \n \n \n    Figure A11.1: Time Slice Analysis \n \n \n \nDemand \n  MW  Load Forecast \n \n \n8,540 \n  With Investment Case \n \n \n  5,447 \n  No Investment Case \nLosses  Due  to \n  Capacity  Constraints \n3,631 and sales lost due to \n  Lack of Generation \n \n \n2007  2010  2015\n \n \n \nMW = megawatt. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n \n9.  The economic and financial benefits are derived from comparing the performance of the \npower sector in Viet Nam under the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d investment scenarios during 2007\u2013\n2030. These are due to (i) higher sales; (ii) lower transmission losses; and (iii) lower fuel cost \nper unit due to optimal plant mix, as the generation and transmission system will be based on \nthe least-cost planning criteria under the \u201cwith\u201d case. This is illustrated in Tables A11.1 and \nTable A11.2. The total generation is maintained at the same level as the \u201cwith\u201d case until 2010 \nusing the surplus generation available in the south. This increases transmission losses and fuel \ncost, and lowers sales due to increased losses. After 2010, the total generation under \u201cwithout\u201d \ncase falls below the total generation under the \u201cwith\u201d case, as transmission constraints become \nbinding. As a result, transmission losses as a percentage drop below the levels reached in \n2010. The share of thermal power and the fuel cost per unit of thermal energy generated also is \nhigher in the \u201cwithout\u201d case than in the \u201cwith\u201d case due to non\u2013optimum dispatch of power plants \nin the \u201cwithout\u201d case. The long-term equilibrium fuel cost forecasts are used in the economic \nanalysis (i.e., coal at $27.6/ton, furnace oil at $157.5/ton, natural gas at $93.8/ton, and diesel at \n$310/ton).  \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.1: Comparison of Losses \u201cWith\u201d and \u201cWithout\u201d Program \nYear  \u201cWith\u201d Case  \u201cWithout\u201d case \n  Generation  Sales   Losses  Generation  Sales   Losses \n(GWh)  (GWh)  (%)  (GWh)  (GWh)  (%) \n2008   77,738   66,972  14.1   77,074   65,027  15.6 \n2009   87,448   75,275  13.9   87,536   71,350  18.5 \n2010   97,964   84,454  13.8   95,530   76,821  19.6 \n2011  109,162   94,512  13.4  102,493   84,149  17.9 \n2012  120,862  105,089  13.1  108,763   89,717  17.5 \n2013  132,905  116,053  12.7  114,791   94,327  17.8 \n2014  145.455  127,288  12.5  123,096  100,819  18.1 \n2015  158,687  139,169  12.3  126,869  104,275  17.8 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A11.2: Comparison of Plant Mix and Thermal Power Fuel Cost \n\u201cWith\u201d and \u201cWithout\u201d Program \nYear  \u201cWith\u201d Case  \u201dWithout\u201d Case \n  Hydro  Thermal  IPP  Fuel Cost  Hydro  Thermal  IPP  Fuel Cost \n(GWh)  (GWh)  (GWh)  (D/kWh)  (GWh)  (GWh)  (GWh)  (D/kWh) \n2008  27,353  37,049  12,636  429  27,064  37,202  12,808  429 \n2009  32,272  38,652  16,391  400  31,222  39,407  16,907  409 \n2010  39,196  36,686  23,223  384  37,985  35,459  22,086  409 \n2011  47,300  39,665  24,654  367  40,472  37,343  24,678  411 \n2012  53,696  44,416  25,781  340  40,724  40,329  27,710  412 \n2013  60,799  48,496  26,161  340  41,426  44,770  28,595  416 \n2014  63,795  51,588  32,522  343  41,694  46,869  34,533  417 \n2015  64,472  55,209  35,378  349  42,368  48,641  35,860  419 \nD/kWh = Dong per kilowatt-hour, GWh \u2013 gigawatt-hour, IPP = independent power producer. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Valuation of Economic Benefits due to Additional Sales \n10.  The economic benefits due to incremental sales under the \u201cwith\u201d case compared with the \n\u201cwithout\u201d case have been quantified separately for residential and nonresidential consumers. \nThe residential consumers can be divided further into existing and additional consumers (i.e., \ncompared with the \u201cwithout\u201d case) for the purpose of economic benefit calculation.

Benefits for Nonresidential Consumers \n \n16.  Nondomestic consumers are assumed to use self-generation to meet their energy needs \nwhen electricity supply is curtailed. Hence, the additional electricity sales in the \u201cwith\u201d case \ncompared  with  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case  to  the  nonresidential  consumers  is  considered  as \nnonincremental consumption, and is valued at the resource cost saving (i.e., cost of meeting the \ndemand  using  self-generation).

Valuation of Cost of Investment Program \n \n17.  The least-cost investment program has been costed at the economic prices to derive the \ninvestment  cost  under  the  \u201cwith\u201d  case  scenario.  To  derive  the  \u201cwithout\u201d  case  investment \nprogram, the investments in the power plants committed but scheduled for commissioning \nduring 2007\u20132015 in northern Viet Nam and the uncommitted investments in transmission in \nnorthern Viet Nam during 2007\u20132015 are excluded from the \u201cwith\u201d case scenario. The difference \nbetween the two scenarios (i.e., incremental capital investment) is used in the benefit-cost \nanalysis. The operation and maintenance cost of the two scenarios is estimated separately for \nthe two scenarios as a percentage (i.e., 3%) of the capital investment in different plants types \nunder the two scenarios. The economic analysis uses the domestic price numeraire by adjusting \nfor  capital  and  operational  costs  valued  at  border  prices,  and  multiplying  by  the  shadow \nexchange rate factor (SERF). \n \n18.  SERF is estimated to be 1.1 for Viet Nam. The fuel cost and the power purchase cost \nfrom independent power producers (IPP) is higher in the \u201cwith\u201d case than in the \u201cwithout\u201d case \ndue to the higher electricity sales in the \u201cwith\u201d case. The analysis shows that economic benefits \nexceed the costs when discounted at a rate of 12%. Further, the investment program has a \npositive net present value of D72,829 trillion and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n23.1% based on the net benefits shown in Table A11.7, which exceeds the hurdle rate of 12%.   \n \nTable A11.7: Economic Benefit-Cost Analysis \n(D billion) \nYear  Economic  Capex  O &M  Fuel Cost  IPP Cost  Economic  Net \nBenefits  Cost  Benefits \n2007  0    5,002  0  0  0   5,002  (5,002) \n2008  2,012  15,384    137   (37)  (108)  15,377  (13,365) \n2009  4,539  27,066    465  (283)  (319)  26,930  (22,391) \n2010  8,737  34,045  1,463   (63)   648  36,092  (27,355) \n2011  12,010  21,484  3,083   (77)     (71)  24,419  (12,409) \n2012  17,820    9,812  3,531  (243)  (1,241)  11,860    5,960 \n2013  25,256    2,670  3,743  (338)  (1,543)   4,533  20,724 \n2014  30,986      771  4,005  (182)  (1,306)   3,288  27,699 \n2015\u20132030  41,028    4,190    62     (376)   3,876  37,152 \nIPP = independent power producer, O & M = operations and manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) (Table A11.9) is calculated for EVN\u2019s \ninvestments in northern Viet Nam during 2004\u20132010. The financing sources are assumed to \nconsist of EVN\u2019s equity contribution, financed through retained earnings, and a combination of \nforeign  and  local  currency  loans.  The  foreign  and  local  currency  loans  earmarked  for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution are assumed to carry different nominal interest rates \nbased on the expectations and experience of EVN.  \n \nTable A11.9: WACC Computation  \nItem  Financing  Nominal  Weigh  Tax Adj.

The cost of EVN\u2019s equity is estimated using a capital asset pricing model. The risk-free \nrate is taken as 8.5% based on the prevailing rate of Government bonds denominated in local \ncurrency. The market risk premium for Viet Nam is taken as 11% based on the average return \non listed companies in Viet Nam. The equity beta for EVN is estimated to be 0.85 based on the \nlisted power utilities in other developing countries. The result is a risk premium of 9.4% (i.e., \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \n11% multiplied by 0.85) and a nominal equity cost of 17.7% (i.e., 8.5% plus 9.4%). The other \nassumptions are a domestic inflation rate of 3%, international interest rate of 1%, tax rate of \n32%, and a minimum interest rate of 2.5% in view of the prevailing low interest rates.  As shown \nin Table A11.9, the WACC for the investment program in northern Viet Nam during 2004\u20132010 \nis 6.86%. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 14.1%, and the financial net present \nvalue (NPV) calculated at WACC (i.e., 6.86%) is D52,538 billion.   \n \nH.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n22.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  (Table  A11.10)  to  several  adverse  movements  in  key \nvariables was analyzed. As the economic analysis was carried out in the incremental basis by \ncomparing the \u201cwith\u201d case and \u201cwithout\u201d case, (i) decrease in the  electricity sales, (ii) reduced \nwillingness  to  pay,  (iii)  increased  capital  expenditure,  (iv)  increased  operation  and  manual \n(O&M) expenses, and (v) reduced fuel cost.  The sensitivity of FIRR also was computed for the \nadverse movements in the same variables, except the change in willingness to pay, which was \nreplaced by reduced electricity tariffs.  \n \n23.  The reduction in fuel cost and IPP cost tends to reduce the EIRR and FIRR, as it lowers \nthe economic benefits attributable to the investment program by lowering the savings in fuel \ncost due to investment program. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that the economic and \nfinancial rate of return of the investment program is sufficiently robust to withstand adverse \nmovements in key variables. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table \nA11.10. \n \nTable A11.10: Sensitivity Analysis \nScenario  Economic Analysis   Financial Analysis \nNPV  EIRR (%)  NPV  FIRR (%) \n20% increase in capital expenses   24,240    15.4   28,237  10.9 \n20% reduction in benefits/revenues   57,567    19.6   41,842  11.8 \n20% increase in capex   68,842    22.5   49,612  13.7 \n20% decrease in fuel costs   72,731    23.1   52,425  14.0 \n20% decrease in IPP cost   72,528    23.0   52,162  14.0 \n20%  increase in capex and O&M   53,580    19.1   38,315  11.4 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, IPP = independent power producer, NPV = net present value, O&M = \noperation and manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.

Introduction \n \n1.  A resettlement framework (RF) was prepared to guide in the resettlement planning and \nimplementation for all subprojects to be processed under the Northern Power Expansion Sector \nProject (the Project). It was built upon the laws of the Government of Viet Nam, principally the \nrevised 2003 Land Law, and Decrees 197 and 188; as well as Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  Provisions and principles adopted in this \nRF, and the resettlement plans (RP) that were prepared subsequently, will supersede the \nprovisions of relevant decrees in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists, as per Decree 17.   \n2.  For the three core subprojects, two RPs for the 240 kilometer (km) 500 kilovolt (kV) Son \nLa\u2013Nho Quan transmission line and the 151.9 km 220 kV Thanh Hoa\u2013Vinh transmission line \nwere prepared based on the objectives, policies, screening, and planning procedures adopted in \nthe RF. An RP is not required for the 220 kV Van Tri substation, because it will not require any \nland acquisition and will not have any resettlement impacts as the transformer will be installed \nwithin the existing substation area.   \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n3.  The  two  core  subproject  RPs  were  prepared  based  on  a  preliminary  design.  The \ntransmission routes were realigned to avoid densely populated areas to minimize resettlement \nimpacts. For the 500 kV Son La\u2013Nho Quan transmission line, no houses and structures are \npermitted along the transmission line corridor. Of the 172 people who will be have to relocate \noutside the transmission line corridor, 153 have residual land to rebuild their houses. The \nremaining 19 people who do not have sufficient land will be provided with another plot of \nresidential land within the commune. The subproject will require the acquisition of 1.95 hectare \n(ha) of residential land, and 29.3 ha of residential land will be affected due to a change in land \nuse (i.e., residential land will be converted into other purposes), for which an easement fee will \nbe paid. For the tower foundations,1 14.5 ha of land will be acquired, while 189.65 ha of land will \nbe affected temporarily. Secondary structures (sheds, toilets), crops (28.6 ha), and 5,965 trees \nalso will be affected. Most of the people affected by the Son La\u2013Nho Quan transmission line are \nethnic minorities (Muong and Thai). Social analysis shows that ethnic minorities are not any \nmore vulnerable than Kinh households to the risks associated with resettlement, since they live \nmostly in mixed communities with Kinh households.   \n4.  For the 220 kV Thanh Hoa\u2013Vinh transmission line, houses and structures not taller than \n5 meters are permitted along the transmission line corridor. However, if more than 70% of the \nresidential land will be traversed by the transmission line corridor, the entire residential area will \nbe acquired. Of the 82 affected persons (AP) identified along the transmission line corridor, 24 \nwill lose more than 70% of their residential land (14.5 ha) and will have to relocate to another \nplot of residential land within the commune. The affected trees (3,519) identified along the \ntransmission line corridor will be cut or trimmed due to height restrictions, and about 3.67 ha of \ncrops also will be affected. For the tower foundations, 6.8 ha of land will be acquired, while 60.7 \nha of land will be affected temporarily.   \n                                                 \n1  For the tower foundations (applicable to the two subprojects), most of the land identified is forest or agricultural. \nThe locations of the towers will be known once the detailed design has been completed. Therefore, the names and \nnumber of APs and level of impact are not known.  ", "Appendix 12  55 \n \nC.  Project Principles and Entitlements Policy \n5.  The following resettlement principles adopted for the Project are as follows:  \n(i)  Involuntary  resettlement  and  loss  of  land,  structures  and  other  assets  and \nincomes will be avoided or minimized by exploring all viable options.  \n(ii)  APs are entitled to compensation for all lost and affected assets, incomes, and \nbusinesses  at  replacement  cost,  and  provided  with  rehabilitation  measures \nsufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain their pre-project living \nstandards, incomes, and productive capacity.  \n(iii)  Lack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected will not bar APs from \nentitlement to such compensation and rehabilitation measures. Those without \nlegal title to land and/or structures occupied or used by them (e.g., non-titled \nAPs) will be entitled to various kinds of resettlement assistance, provided they \ncultivated and occupied the land before the eligibility cutoff date. Resettlement \nassistance  to  non-titled  APs  will  include  compensation  for  lost  assets  and \nrestoration of income and living standards.    \n(iv)  Compensation for affected assets will be provided at replacement cost. Where \nrelocation or displacement is required, efforts will be made to maintain the social \nand cultural institutions of the people being resettled and host community to the \nextent possible.  \n(v)  Preparation of RPs (as part of subproject preparation) and their implementation \nis to be carried out with participation and consultation of affected people.  \n(vi)  Implementation  schedule  and  budget  for  resettlement  planning  (including \nsocioeconomic survey and census) and implementation will be incorporated into \neach subproject and the overall project. \n(vii)  Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) will ensure that civil works contractors are not \nissued a notice of possession of site for any section of construction works unless \nNorthern  Power  Project  Management  Board  (NPPMB)  has  (a)  satisfactorily \ncompleted, in accordance with the approved relevant RP for that subproject, \ncompensation payment and relocation to new sites, and (b) ensured that the \nrehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is free of \nall encumbrances.  \n(viii)  Compensation  for  vulnerable  households  (female-headed  households  with \ndependents,  disabled  household  heads,  poor  households,  landless  elderly \nhouseholds with no means of support, households without security of tenure, and \nethnic minorities living in remote, isolated areas or in communes with special \ndifficulties as classified under Government Programme 135) will be carried out \nwith respect for their cultural values and specific needs. Assistance will include \nmeasures to help them improve their socioeconomic status. \n \n6.  The  project  entitlements  (Table  A12.1)  are  designed  to  cover  compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation for lost assets; and to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all \nAPs.

Consultation, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure \n7.  Consultation began in 2004 through a series of meetings with provinces, districts, and \ncommunes, as well as APs. In early 2005, NPPMB and project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) consultants consulted further with commune leaders and APs to discuss the resettlement \nimpacts, availability of replacement land, and the required measures and assistance to ensure \nthat APs can restore, if not improve, their livelihoods. Further consultation will be carried out ", "Appendix 12  57 \n \nbefore the design is finalized, and will continue throughout the Project. A four-step procedure \nhas been established to deal with any resettlement-related issues, concerns, or grievances \nraised during project implementation. APs will be exempted from administrative and legal fees \nassociated with resolving the grievance. \n \n8.  Before ADB\u2019s Management Review Meeting (MRM), the RF and RPs will be translated \ninto  the  Vietnamese  language.  Copies  of  the  RF  and  RPs,  in  English  and  Vietnamese \nlanguages,  will  be  distributed  to  the  respective  provinces.  The  public  information  booklets \nprepared  for  the  two  subprojects  will  be  translated  into  Vietnamese  language  (and  ethnic \nminority language, as required), and will be distributed to all APs. Copies of the RPs will be \nplaced in the respective district and commune offices. In accordance with ADB\u2019s new Public \nCommunications Policy, the RF and RPs submitted to ADB for review and approval will be \nimmediately uploaded on ADB\u2019s resettlement Web site. The final versions of these documents \nwill be uploaded upon Board approval.   \n \nE.  Gender, Ethnicity, and Poverty Issues \n \n9.  Women, ethnic minorities who live in remote and isolated areas, and poor households \nare among the most vulnerable groups affected by resettlement. In many of the core project \nareas, the number and proportion of poor households is significantly higher than the national \naverage in Viet Nam. In accordance with the RF, RP preparation and implementation will pay \nspecial attention to (i) the role of women\u2019s economic activities in restoring living standards; (ii) \naccess to existing credit and agricultural extension for women, ethnic minorities, and poor \nhouseholds; (iii) joint registration of land use rights in the names of husband and wife where \nhouseholds are allocated alternative agricultural and/or residential land; (iv) participation and \nconsultation strategies that encourage the involvement of women, ethnic minorities, and poor \nhouseholds in resettlement planning and implementation; (v) complaints and grievances lodged \nby women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; and (vi) disaggregated data collection on \ngender and ethnic minorities to support resettlement planning and monitoring. A project-specific \ngender strategy has been developed and is included in Section D (Gender and Development) of \nthe Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 13). \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements and Schedule \n \n10.  EVN, as the Executing Agency, will appoint a full-time resettlement staff to effectively \nliaise and coordinate closely with the involved ministries and other agencies, as well as with the \ncompensation  and  resettlement  boards  (CARB)  and  NPPMB.  Its  project  management  unit \n(PMU), NPPMB, has been established in Hanoi. In coordination with relevant agencies, the \nPMU will manage and supervise the Project. NPPMB will create a social and environment unit \n(SEU), and will assign full-time and qualified resettlement staff responsible for social issues, \nparticularly  (i)  resettlement  planning  and  management,  (ii)  ethnic  minority  development \nplanning, (iii) HIV/AIDS awareness program, (iv) poverty and social impact assessments, and \n(v) labor practices.   \n \n11.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  starting  in  2006.  Implementation  of \nresettlement and related activities will take place after the mobilization of the project supervision \nconsultant,  who  will  work  closely  with,  and  assist,  the  NPPMB  in  all  resettlement-related \nactivities. Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession of site for any section \nof  construction  works unless  NPPMB  has  (i)  completed,  in  accordance  with  the  approved \nrelevant RP for that subproject, compensation payment and relocation to new sites; and (ii) \nensured that the rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the area required for civil works is free \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nof encumbrances. The implementation schedule, with the envisaged sequence of activities, is \nshown in Table A12.2.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  The implementing agencies (NPPMB and CARBs) and ADB will conduct regular internal \nmonitoring of the RP implementation. NPPMB will submit quarterly monitoring reports to ADB.  \nNPPMB will engage an independent monitoring agency to conduct external monitoring and \nevaluation, focusing on the social impacts of the Project and whether APs are able to improve or \nat least restore their pre-project living standards, incomes, and productive capacity.     \n \nH.  Resettlement Budget and Flow of Funds \n \n13.  The  Project  has  budgeted  $15.0  million  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  This \nincludes  compensation  payments  and  allowances  to  APs,  operational  and  administration \nexpenses, internal and external monitoring, and contingencies. \n \n14.

NPPMB and CARB will be responsible for paying APs directly for \nland, crops, trees, houses, other structures, and any allowances.   \n ", "Appendix 13  59 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to poverty reduction in Viet Nam: \nViet Nam has made remarkable progress in providing electricity services to the population. This is a key objective in \nthe Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The share of households with access to electricity \nincreased from 49% in 1992 to 86% in 2002. Demand for electricity has increased substantially in the past decade as \nincomes have increased and poverty has declined. This has increased household affordability of appliances and \nelectricity services. However, annual per capita consumption remains among the lowest in Asia at about 500 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh). Utilization of rural households is even lower, about 180 kWh per year or 15 kWh per month. \n \nA reliable and good quality electricity supply is important for economic growth and poverty reduction. Electricity \nsupply promotes alternative sources of income that reduce the vulnerability of households to falling into poverty. \nAccess to electricity has expenditure-reducing effects, which is particularly important for poor households. Reduced \nexpenditure on electricity allows households to use more expenditure for food, education, and health services. \nAccess to electricity also reduces the workload of women in food processing and collecting water. Irrigation using \nelectricity reduces input cost for farmers and increases agricultural productivity.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe 2002 Viet Nam Living Standard survey shows that the national incidence of poverty has fallen from 37% in 1998 \nto 29% in 2002. Even though the economic growth and pro-poor development approach has progressed substantially \nover the decade, the benefit of poverty reduction and rate of decline and incidence of poverty varies greatly across \nthe country. Some regions and some population groups have gained more than the others. The northern region is \nthe poorest among the nine regions in Viet Nam. The project provinces are in the northern region. Son La province \nwas the third poorest provinces in the northern region with a poverty head count of 71.4%. The decline in poverty in \nurban areas has been greater, declining at nearly twice the rate of rural areas. The Government is now preparing a \nnew cycle of targeted poverty reduction programs. The Government also has increased budget allocations to \ntargeted programs associated with poverty reduction in the poorest provinces. \n \nThe high share of households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting suggests that poor households \nare connected. The share of poor households reported to use electricity as a main source of lighting in the project \nareas ranges from 75% to 95%. The cost of connection is a barrier for many poor households to use electricity. The \nratio of rural to urban beneficiaries is about 1:4. This means that the majority of project benefits will accrue to urban \nareas, where poverty incidences are generally lower. However, with strong rural-urban links, increasing urban \nmigration (particularly of females who make up an increasing proportion of migrants), and remittances, indirect \nimpacts in terms of employment and income of the project are expected to benefit some households in rural areas.    \n \nThe level of electricity consumption is normally strongly correlated with income. This is mainly because as household \nincomes rise, affordability of appliances increases. Poor households, thus, consume smaller amounts than nonpoor. \nThe very poor often are limited to using one or two light bulbs, and sometimes an electric fan. Among the poorest \nhouseholds in Viet Nam with access to electricity, electricity accounts for less than 2% of their total spending. This is \nlow compared with other countries in the region. Consumption levels range from 2 kWh per month for the very poor \nto around 20\u201330 kWh for the poor just below and above the poverty line. The near-poor and poor just below the \npoverty line have some affordability of appliances, and might even have a TV. Of the poorest income quintile, 17% \nreported having a color TV. However, these appliances, while cheap in terms of capital costs, are secondhand and \ninefficient in electricity usage, and thus are more expensive to run. Despite these low consumption levels, electricity \nis a priority for poor households. This is reflected in the fact that they are willing to sell an animal, depleting their \nsavings, to pay for up front connection charges. Thus, the value of just a few kWh of electricity consumption in terms \nof enhancing the quality of life is large from the household perspective. Most households use electricity for domestic \nactivities such as lighting, water pump, TV, and radio. Very few of the poor use electricity for own-business activities. \nAccess to the grid also has large expenditure-reducing effects for poor households, and allows them to become more \nenergy efficient, using fewer kWh. \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \n \nHowever, in rural areas electricity services are not always reliable and of good quality. This is due to the rapid \nexpansion of the electricity network, poor local network management, and poor and long wiring from the pole to the \nhouse in rural areas. High losses and inadequate power supply remain a burden for many of the connected rural \nconsumers. Unreliable services and voltage fluctuations reduce some of the benefits of electricity. First, electricity \nusage for income-earning activities in agriculture and small-scale commercial activities are adversely affected with a \nconsequent loss in income. Second, voltage fluctuations reduce the lifespan of appliances and increase the cost of \nusing electricity. This will deter consumers from purchasing appliances and using electricity optimally.  \n \nIn urban areas, the requirement of formal registration cards is a key barrier for poor informal migrants, often from \nrural areas, to connect directly to Electricity of Viet Nam\u2019s (EVN\u2019s) services. This has created a market for \u201cmiddle-\nmen\u201d, or meter landlords, who buy electricity from EVN and onsell to end-consumers at higher prices. This depletes \nthe intention of the substantial subsidies on the lowest tariff category. Subsidies in the sector are better able to reach \nthe poor in Viet Nam than in most other countries in the region. This is because of the high connection rates. In \nurban areas, the poor do not receive the full benefit of subsidies due to the existence of meter landlords. The design \nof the tariff structure and the overall subsidy level is not particularly pro-poor. Reducing subsidies in the sector and \ntargeting the subsidy to the poor would be important. Affordability of up front charges and monthly charges among \nthe ethnic minorities living in the project area remains an issue. The poverty analysis has been summarized in a \nPoverty Impact Matrix (Table A13.1). \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? Yes. Consultations regarding land acquisition and resettlement issues were \nundertaken  with  key  government  officials  and  the  affected  people,  and  will  continue  during  preparation  of \nsubprojects. During project implementation, stakeholders and the affected people will participate extensively.      \n \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes. The Government\u2019s Decree 80 (Regulation for Participatory Investment \nSupervision) and Decree 79 (Grassroots Democracy) encourage community empowerment to undertake supervision \nand monitoring of investment made in the interest of the community. The gender strategy will facilitate effective \nimplementation of the decrees at the commune level to monitor resettlement activities, HIV/AIDS and trafficking \nawareness campaign, and condition of labor camp under construction contract.  \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe gender analysis includes households affected by land acquisition. In Viet Nam, while the Land Law provides for \nequal land use and ownership, in reality a number of social and cultural traditions influence access to land by making \na distinction between social recognition and legal rights. For the Project, all data collected during the inventory of loss \nand socioeconomic survey for resettlement planning were gender disaggregated. The socioeconomic survey for the \nproject indicates that male and female households are engaged equally in Government services. However, a higher \npercentage of women is engaged in trade and sales. More men are engaged in daily labor than women. However, \nalong the Thanh Hoa\u2013Vinh transmission line, a relatively higher portion of women are engaged in construction work. \nThe socioeconomic survey of the project shows that high proportions of poor and vulnerable groups, including \nfemale-headed households, live within the subproject areas. In Viet Nam, female-headed households account for \n26% of all households. In rural areas, women-headed households constitute 17% of all households, and the female-\nheaded households are vulnerable to shocks. In Son La\u2013Nho Quan and Son La-Soc Son 500 kV transmission line \nproject areas, 16% and 13% of the households are headed by females, respectively. The resettlement plan (RP) \nindicates that the only permanent land acquisition associated with clearance of the right-of-way is the area of \nresidential and garden land associated with the house or structure to be removed, or if the entire plot is affected \nbecause the remaining area is not sufficient to rebuild the house or structure. The inventory of loss (IOL) has \nidentified these effects on an individual household level. The locations of the tower foundations will not be known \nuntil the detailed design is complete. Therefore, only the approximate area of agricultural and forest land likely to be \nneeded temporarily, and that to be acquired permanently, is known at this stage. The IOL has aggregated district-\nlevel data, and identifies these effects at a provincial level in terms of the amount of agricultural, forest, rural \nresidential, and other land to be affected temporarily or permanently. During the updating of the plan, and once the \neffects on productive land are known, the measures to support and restore the livelihoods of all severely affected  \nhouseholds can be identified in consultation with them. Field observation on the RP on Son LA Hydropower suggests \nthat women often were not consulted on preparation and implementation of the RP. Leaders of the Women Union \nparticipated  little  in  the  District  Resettlement  Compensation  Management  Committee  (DRCMC).  A  separate \ngrievance process on resettlement issues in the commune and district level does not exist. Risks associated with \ntrafficking and HIV/AIDS among the migrant workers in the project areas are identifiable. To ensure participation of \nwomen in project activities during implementation of the RP and social support program, the following measures are ", "Appendix 13  61 \n \nincluded in the gender strategy. Budget required to implement the gender strategy is included in the project costs.  \n \nGender Strategy: \n \n\u2022  At the inception of the Project, a capacity building training program will be designed for the women \ncommune leaders from the affected commune, with priority given to the women from ethnic minority \nhouseholds. The training also will include male commune leaders and representatives of the mass \norganizations. The training will include information and awareness on the resettlement activities of the \nProject. The awareness and leadership skill training will enhance women\u2019s participation at the commune \nlevel in resettlement-related discussions and commune investment supervisory groups under Decree 80 \n(Regulation on the assignment of sale, business contracting, and lease of state companies) and Decree 79 \n(Regulation on the exercise of democracy in communes). Capacity building training also will be provided to \nthe leaders of the Women\u2019s Union to increase their participation in DRCMC; \n\u2022  The DRCMC will include women representatives from the District Women\u2019s Union to represent the interest \nof women and women-headed households from the affected households. At the commune level, specific \nresettlement committees will be formed to discuss the RP of the Project. Specific strategies will be \ndeveloped to encourage women, ethnic minorities, and poor households to participate in resettlement \nplanning and implementation;  \n\u2022  During the IOL, men and women from the households will participate in the discussion of IOL. At the  \nvillage, hamlet, and commune-level discussion for preparation and implementation of the RP, separate \nmeetings will be held with the women from the affected households and female-headed households to \ndetermine (i) the impacts on the productive land, (ii) problems related to relocation and temporary \nrelocation of house, and (iii) the additional measures or specific assistance that are required to address the \nneeds of the women-headed households and women from the affected households;  \n\u2022  DRCMC and commune leaders will consult separately with the women-headed households and women \nfrom the households losing more than 10% of their productive land to identify the assistance required in \nterms of selection of sites for productive land, extension services, training, and capital support required to \nrestore their livelihood;  \n\u2022  The RP of the Project includes a socioeconomic support program with a focus on women, specifically \nwomen-headed households, women and men from poor households, and vulnerable groups.  Specific \nattention will be paid to (i) restoring economic activities of the women from garden land; (ii) providing \nwomen in the new settlement area access to existing agriculture extension and microcredit and financial \nservices; and (iii) establishing links with a marketing facility and relevant technical assistance, as required;  \n\u2022  RP will include joint registration of land use rights in the names of husband and wife in instances where \nhouseholds are allocated alternative agriculture and/or residential land;  \n\u2022  Attention to complaints and grievances made by women, ethnic minorities, and poor households; \n\u2022  The  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness campaign  will  involve  women\u2019s  union,  youth union, health \nworkers, and women community leaders; \n\u2022  Women as well as men from severely affected poor households will be prioritized for employment-related \ncivil works for the transmission lines; \n\u2022  As per the Labor Code (as amended in 2002), all employment for the subproject will respect Government \ncommitments to gender equity including (i) employment targets for women, as relevant to ethnic minorities; \n(ii) ensure that no child labor will be used; (iii) no discrimination against the employment of qualified \nwomen; and (iv) no differential wages paid to men and women for work of equal value; \n\u2022  Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic groups will be developed for management \ninformation system; \n\u2022  Gender sensitization training for relevant staff from EVN and Northern Power Project Management Board \n(NPPMB), members of the Provincial Resettlement Steering Committee, DRCMC, and commune leaders.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?  \nYes, a gender strategy has been prepared (see above). \nA national consultant on gender and development will be included in the consulting services for turning the gender \nissues into an implementation plan.

Environmental Due Diligence Objectives and Projects Overview  \n \n1.  Environmental Due Diligence Objectives \n \n1.  In 2002, the Prime Minister approved the Hydropower Development Master Plan on the \nDa River as part of the Fifth Power Development Master Plan for development of several \nhydropower cascades, including the (i) 1,950-megawatt (MW) Hoa Binh Hydropower Project, \nwhich was completed in 1994; (ii) 2,400 MW Son La Hydropower Project (SLHPP) on the Da \nRiver; and (iii) 560 MW Huoi Quang Hydropower Projects (HQHPP) on the Nam Mu tributary. \nEnvironmental due diligence was undertaken to determine what gaps exist\u2014and, if so, how \nsignificant they are\u2014between the environment impact assessments (EIA) and environment \nmanagement plans (EMP) prepared for implementation under the SLHPP and HQHPP and the \nGovernment\u2019s and international best practices for EIAs and EMPs. \n \n2.  Overview of Son La and Huoi Quang Hydropower Projects   \n2.  Due to the large hydropower potential on the Da River in the northwestern region, and its \nbenefits  to  the  Red  River  delta  region,  the  SLHPP  was  approved  by  the  Ninth  National \nAssembly\u2019s resolution as a national priority project to (i) supply electricity for industrialization \nand modernization of Viet Nam; (ii) contribute to flood control during the rainy season, and \nsupply water for irrigation during the dry season in the Red River Delta; and (iii) support the \nsocioeconomic development of the northwestern region. The construction began in 2004 with \naccess  roads,  diversion  channels,  and  coffer  dams.  The  Prime  Minister  granted  special \napproval to start the works, even though the refinements to the feasibility study (FS) and the \nfinal EIA are not done. The EIA is to be completed and submitted to the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) by the end of 2005. \n \n3.  The HQHPP is on one of the two cascades on the Nam Mu River, a first level tributary \non the right bank of the Da River. It has been studied as part of the Master Plan for Da River \nHydropower Cascades, and was approved by the Prime Minister in 2002. HQHPP\u2019s FS-phase \nEIA was submitted to MONRE\u2019s in February 2005. It was granted conditional approval subject to \na list of revisions to be made before construction. Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) is making these \nrevisions.  \n \nB.  Environmental Management Plan of SLHPP  \n \n4.  Several versions of the EIA prepared for SLHPP did not include an EMP as defined by \nthe Government\u2019s EIA guidelines for hydropower projects. Six technical annexes have been \nprepared  for  individual  environmental  factors,  such  as  water  resources,  soil  environment, \ngeology  and  topography,  biodiversity,  and  socioeconomic  environment.  These  annexes \ndescribe  baseline  conditions,  predict  impacts,  and  recommend  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures. Although the measures in these individual studies cover most of the relevant topics \nfor hydropower projects, they lack information on institutional arrangements and cost estimates. \nBefore completing that main EIA report, the mitigation and monitoring measures recommended \nin  the  individual  technical  annexes  need  to  be  consolidated  into  a  single  set  of  discrete \nmeasures for the Project to avoid, or minimize, the significant environmental impacts in the most \ncost-effective way. Ideally, these measures will be incorporated into a formal EMP with specific \nschedule, budget, and institutional arrangements.   \n ", "  Appendix 14  65\n5.  In the absence of a formal EMP, as the final EIA report of SLHPP is still being prepared, \nan  agreement  was  reached  that  EVN  will  begin  preparing  an  EMP  for  immediate \nimplementation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  reviewed  the  EMP,  and  made \nrecommendations to improve as well as suggestions on the institutional arrangements for its \nimplementation. EVN has allocated staff and a budget of $200,000 for the implementation of the \nEMP in the first year. EVN also requested ADB assistance in building its capacity to prepare, \nmonitor, implement, and update the EMP regularly as construction progresses. The capacity \nbuilding also will include upstream and downstream impact mitigation measures. ADB technical \nassistance (TA) for $800,000 is being formulated to assist EVN in these matters. \n \nC.  Environmental Management Plan of HQHPP \n \n6.  Chapter VI of the FS EIA focuses on EMP, presenting budget information on mitigation \nand monitoring measures for (i) reservoir cleanup, (ii) demining operations, (iii) restoration of \nland use, (iv) climate and hydrology monitoring, (v) air monitoring, and (vi) fish and aquatic \norganism monitoring. A budget of $725,500 has been allocated for these items. In general, the \nmitigation measures proposed in the EIA for HQHPP cover the relevant topics, although they \nare relatively vague and would need to be more site-specific. The institutional arrangements and \nresponsible agencies for the implementation of mitigation measures also need to be spelled out \nclearly.  Although  this  does  not  meet  the  ADB\u2019s  requirement,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  guidelines  on \nhydropower EIA do not specifically require such information.   \n \n7.  The  monitoring  activities  given  in  the  EIA  are  considered  adequate,  detailed,  and \nspecific in terms of the parameters required, number of monitoring points, frequency, and cost \nestimates, as well as the institutional arrangement for implementation. This section could be \nimproved by providing maps that show the monitoring points for each parameter. Suggestions \nhave been given to EVN for incorporation when finalizing the EIA. The monitoring program can \nbe considered adequate in meeting ADB\u2019s and Viet Nam\u2019s requirements.  \n \nD.  Field  Observations  of  Environmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  and  Monitoring \nMeasures for SLHPP and HQHPP \n8.  The SLHPP dam construction has not started. The dam will be 135 meters (m) high, \ntopping out at 228 m above mean sea level. The construction has begun on the diversion \nchannel, which will be 90 m wide, 857 m long, and 12 m below current (dry season) river \nsurface level. The main channel is excavated mostly to design depth, with construction focusing \non leveling the rocky bottom to accommodate a concrete base and excavating a deeper channel \nto take dry season flow. Dikes are being built across the river at the site of the future power \nstation. The diversion channel and dikes will be finished by the end of 2005, and the power \nstation will be completed in 2008. \n \n9.  Several roads have been constructed, traversing very steep mountainsides. As such, the \nconstruction involves removing large volumes of earth and rock to make way for the road, as \nwell as to create stable embankment faces in the hillsides above the roads. It was possible to \ntraverse only a sampling of the site and vicinity roads. In general, the roads appear to be well \ndesigned in terms of grade and slope of cut faces, though they could be improved through basic \nforms of drainage, erosion control during and after construction, and revegetation. A two-lane \nbridge has been built across the river below the dam. Two more bridges are planned within 2\u20133 \nkilometer (km) downstream of the dam. \n \n  ", "66   Appendix 14 \n \n10.  The Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE) in Son La Province \nstated that construction of a biological wastewater treatment plant for domestic sewage, and a \nlandfill for domestic solid waste disposal, started recently at the campsite that houses 5,000 \nworkers. In the interim, pit latrines have been built for the construction workers.  \n \n11.  About 4 million cubic meters (m3) of material has been excavated, including 1 million m3 \nfor the diversion channel. As expected for so much earth removal in the river channel, siltation \nwas apparent in the river. However, in the absence of baseline data or documents in English, \ncomparing the sediment load of the Da River downstream of the dam with upstream sections, or \nwith  the  river  before  the  construction  began,  is  difficult.  Road  construction  and  especially \nswidden  agriculture  (slash  and  burn  on  steep  slopes),  which  are  prevalent  in  the  region, \ncontribute significantly to runoff, erosion, and sedimentation of the rivers. \n \n12.  Construction has not started for the proposed HQHPP site, although it is envisaged to \nbegin in 2006. Similar to the Son La construction site, the reservoir area can be described as a \nsteep-walled valley with limestone pinnacles protruding from earthen hills. The natural mountain \nhas subtropical vegetation, and has been removed or impacted significantly throughout the area \nby slash-and-burn agriculture on the steep upper slopes, and rice paddies on the lower slopes \nand in the valley bottoms. A few small Thai villages are along the road. As in Son La and \nelsewhere in the region, road construction in and near the towns appears almost continuous, \nwith extensive disturbed area left unpaved and unvegetated. Streams appear to be carrying a \nhigh sediment load, though samples were not taken. Very little, if any, wild animal life was \nobserved,  though  domesticated  animals  were  omnipresent.  Nonetheless,  the  valley  is \naesthetically very appealing. \n \nE.  Recommendations  \n13.  EIAs of the hydropower plants should be consolidated with environmental assessments \nfor associated actions, including roads, and resettlement actions to provide comprehensive \nresults to the Government for better policy decisions.    \n \n14.  A cumulative EIA should be performed. SLHPP and HQHPP projects meet the criteria \nfor  a  cumulative  assessment  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines. The \nSLHPP project would benefit from a full-scale, basin-wide, cumulative assessment. This was \ndiscussed  with  EVN  and  MONRE,  while  the  Government  requested  ADB  assistance  to \nundertake a cumulative assessment to follow the current project EIA. An ADB TA for $900,000 \nis being formulated to assist MONRE and EVN in building its capacity to undertake such \nassessments. \n \n15.  Additional recommendations include \n \n(i)  Prepare and implement an EMP for SLHPP and HQHPP based on Government\u2019s \nEIA guidelines on hydropower projects.  \n(ii)  Appoint a full-time environmental monitor in the field for SLHPP. \n(iii)  Involve  MONRE  in  the  implementation  of  hydropower  project  EMPs,  with \noversight responsibility beyond EIA approval and into the EMP implementation. \n(iv)  Develop laws requiring preparation and implementation of EMPs for all HPP \nprojects, irrespective of financing source.  \n(v)  Build institutional capacity of DONREs to oversee EMP implementation.  \n(vi)  Build capacity of River Basin Organizations to oversee EMP implementation. \n   ", "  Appendix 15  67\nSUMMARY SOCIAL DUE DILIGENCE OF SON LA AND HUOI QUANG  \nHYDROPOWER PROJECTS \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam is financing the 2,400 megawatt (MW) Son La Hydropower \nProject (SLHPP) and 560 MW Huoi Quang Hydropower Project (HQHPP). About 96,000 people \nwill have to be relocated as a result of these two hydropower projects. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) engaged the Government in policy dialogue on resettlement and compensation in \nthe context of processing the Northern Power Expansion Sector Project. The Government \nagreed to have ADB undertake due diligence with several objectives: (i) determine the status of \nresettlement planning and implementation of the two hydropower projects, (ii) determine if \nresettlement planning and implementation complies with Government laws and regulations, (iii) \nidentify outstanding issues and gaps between planning and implementation and Government\u2019s \npolicies,  (iv)  assess  any  gaps  between  implementation  and  international  best  practices  in \nsafeguard  policies,  and  (v)  recommend  ways  to  improve  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation to meet Government\u2019s standards.   \n2.  In this context, meetings were held with representatives of Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN); \nmembers of Son La Hydropower Project Management Board (SLHPPMB); Huoi Quang Project \nManagement Board (HQPPMB); officials from the provincial, district, and commune people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPC, DPC, and CPC, respectively) of Son La, Lai Chau, and Dien Bien provinces; \nrepresentatives from the provincial and district resettlement committees (DRC); party cells; \nNational Institute of Agricultural Production and Projection (NIAPP); and Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development (MARD). \n \n3.  Field visits, observations, interviews, and discussions with commune and village officials, \naffected  households,  and  host  communities  at  the  pilot  resettlement  sites  and  proposed \nresettlement  sites  were  carried  out.  Semi-structured  questionnaires  also  were  utilized  in \ngathering information.  Details of the due diligence are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB.  Legal and Policy Framework \n \n4.  Prime Minister Special Decision 459/QD-TTg. For SLHPP, the Prime Minister issued \nDecision No 92/QD-TTg, dated 15 January 2004, approving $686 million for the resettlement \nand compensation associated with SLHPP. In 12 May 2004, the Prime Minister issued Special \nDecision  459/QD-TTg,  based  on  the  Decree  22/1998/CP,  which  provides  policies  on \nresettlement and compensation, as well as lessons learned from the resettlement pilot sites in \nTan Lap and Muong Chum communes (Son La Province) and Siphaphin commune (Dien Bien \nProvince). The general principles of special decision are to ensure that (i) the standard of living \nof the affected population is restored and improved, and housing and income is better than at \nthe  former  site;  (ii)  equal  benefits  of  relocatees  and  host  communities  to  maintain  social \nharmony; (iii) relocation sites provide adequate production land for affected population, and that \nproviding production land is prioritized; and (iv) compensation and assistance are carried out \ndemocratically, transparently, and effectively. \n \n5.  Special Decision 459/QD-TTg presents advancement in terms of compensation payment \nfor various losses, as it is based on replacement cost or current market value at the time of \ncompensation payment. Unlike Decree 22/1998, which provides land for nonlegal users on a \ncase-by-case basis, Special Decision 459/QD-TTg provides replacement land and assistance \nregardless  of  legal  status.  Furthermore,  the  affected  population  will  not  only  receive \n ", "68   Appendix 15 \n \nreplacement  land  and  houses;  but  also  will  be  entitled  to  transition  allowances  (e.g.,  rice \nsubsidy,  moving  allowance,  health,  education,  cooking  fuel,  electricity  fees  assistance), \nlivelihood and economic programs, and basic services and community infrastructures.   \n \n6.  Following Special Decision 459, the provinces of Son La, Lai Chau, and Dien Bien \nissued  their  respective  PPC  decisions  for  preparing  and  implementing  detailed  plans  for \nSLHPP. For HQHPP, resettlement planning is continuing, and Lai Chau province also will adopt \nSpecial Decision 459 in their issuance of a PPC decision.   \n \n7.  Master  Plan  on  Resettlement  and  Compensation  and  Detailed  Resettlement \nPlans.1 In addition to the Special Decision 459/QD-TTg, the Prime Minister approved the Master \nPlan on Resettlement and Compensation in November 2004. The master plan was revised and \nfinalized in February 2005, and is now used as a basis for preparing detailed RPs.  The master \nplan provides information about the resettlement areas, as well as general guidelines on the \nproper and timely preparation and implementation of detailed RPs. The document also stated \nthat further in-depth studies would have to be undertaken, and that the programs need to be \nadjusted accordingly during detailed planning and implementation to reflect the situations in the \nresettlement sites, which might require further approval of MARD and PPC. \n \n8.  The master plan envisages about 14,993 households will be affected by the SLHPP. \nHowever, taking into account 4% population growth to 2010, an estimated 18,897 households \n(about  90,000  people)  will  have  to  be  relocated  by  2010.  The  host  communities  from  83 \ncommunes affected by land recovery are estimated at 12,000 households.   \n \n9.  The  master  plan  noted  a  number  of  difficulties  and  limitations  in  implementing \nresettlement programs in the three provinces (Son La, Dien Bien, and Lai Chau): (i) almost all \nrelocatees are ethnic minorities; (ii) the terrain is complex and divided, and land and water are \nlimited;  (iii)  the  area  is  beset  by  low  productivity  of  land  and  absence  of  markets;  (iv) \ninfrastructure is lacking; and (v) training and change of occupations are needed. Nonetheless, \nthe report also presents potential development opportunities from agriculture and silviculture. It \nindicates that socioeconomic programs of the three provinces are being maintained; that the \npeople have a positive perception of resettlement, as it is conceived as part of the development \nproject that will provide benefits; and that local authorities and host communities are supporting \nthem. \n \n10.  The master plan also mentioned the respective roles and responsibilities of MARD and \nthe PPCs in preparing and implementing detailed RPs. The budget indicated in the master plan \nis $686.3 million. EVN will finance 45% ($308.9 million), while the Government will finance 49% \n($333.3  million).  The  remaining  6%  ($44.1  million),  specifically  for  investment  in  livelihood \nprograms (agriculture, animal breeding, and forest plantation programs), will be sourced from \nthe Government\u2019s People\u2019s Credit Fund. The Ministry of Finance was tasked to manage the \ninvestment and prepare annual allocation plan to provincial investors.     \n \n                                                 \n1 The Government\u2019s Son La Master Plan is equivalent to ADB\u2019s Resettlement Framework, while detailed resettlement \nplans are similar to those of ADB\u2019s resettlement plans. \n   ", "  Appendix 15  69\nC.  Son La Hydropower Project: Summary of Gaps Between Government\u2019s Policies \n  and Implementation at the Pilot Resettlement Sites \n \n11.  Before Special Decision 459/Qd-TTg was issued, PPC\u2019s issued decisions pertaining to \nthe relocation of households to the pilot resettlement sites. From 2000 to 2003, 675 relocatees, \nmostly Thai ethnic minorities, were moved to the three pilot resettlement sites. Some 200 \nrelocatees went to the Siphaphin pilot resettlement site, while 475 relocatees went to the Tan \nLap and Muong Chum pilot resettlement sites. Host communities affected by land recovery \ncomprised 143 households from Siphaphin commune, and 770 households from Tan Lap and \nMuong Chum communes. \n \n12.  Due  diligence  in  the  three  pilot  resettlement  sites  produced  common  findings.  For \nexample, not all provisions as stipulated in the PPC decisions were provided to relocatees and \nhost communities. Some outstanding issues and problems remain at the resettlement sites:   \n \n(i)  Living  conditions.  Their  living  conditions  did  not  improve,  and  in  some \ninstances were worse than the relocatees\u2019 former living standards. In the Tan \nLap resettlement site, 50 households went back to the reservoir areas to cultivate \ntheir former land. Almost all relocatees cannot access land allocated to them, \nbecause the land had belonged to host communities that were not compensated \nfor the recovered land. Host communities in Siphaphin commune, whose land \nwas recovered, are experiencing 5\u20136 months food shortage. Further, the non-\ncompensation to host communities created hostilities and social tensions at the \nsite. Houses of relocatees reportedly were hit at night, and children were bullied \nin school.   \n(ii)  Information disclosure and participation. The relocatees were not properly \ninformed and not consulted adequately. The host communities were notified only \nonce before land recovery. Details on pricing and timing of the inventory of \nlosses (IOL) and land recovery were not provided to them. Clearing of land by \ncontractors without prior knowledge of host communities led to serious loss of \nland  and  crops.  In  addition,  the  relocatees  or  host  communities  were  not \nrepresented on the resettlement committees.  \n(iii)  Land recovered from host communities. Land recovered and affected crops \nand trees from host communities were not recorded properly. As a result, they \nwere not compensated. Host communities in the Siphaphin commune received \ncompensation  2  years  after  land  was  recovered.  Not  all  host  communities \nreceived full payment due to them. \n(iv)  Cash payment for land and other assets. Some land, crops, and trees were \nnot inventoried because the areas were not accessible. The age of trees also \nwas downgraded. Not all garden land and fishponds included in the inventory \nwere compensated. Unit prices applied for crops and trees were lower than \naverage market prices. \n(v)  Production land. In Tan Lap, land allocated to relocatees is smaller than what \nthey had before. The productivity of land is also low (one harvest season). An \nirrigation system is lacking. The affected population finds it difficult to improve the \nsituation and make the land productive. Some relocatees received less land than \nothers due to a shortage at the resettlement sites. In Siphaphin, irrigation that will \nbe  operational  in  June  2005  will  benefit  only  30%  of  relocatees.  Provincial \ngovernments admitted that land is insufficient to allocate for relocatees and host \ncommunities. \n  ", "70   Appendix 15 \n \n(vi)  Residential  land,  housing,  and  other  facilities  at  the  resettlement  sites.  \nQuality of house construction was poor. Although houses built were patterned on \ntraditional  houses,  they  did  not  fully  incorporate  ethnic  customs  and  beliefs. \nWater supply is also inadequate to meet the demands of the village.   \n(vii)  Resettlement allowances. The rice subsidy provided was insufficient and the \nlivelihood  programs  implemented  was  not  successful.  The  land  allocated  for \nrelocation is small and its productivity low. The cash equivalent of rice subsidy is \nlower than the local market prices. In Tan Lap, an education allowance was not \nprovided. Cash assistance for moving graves was lower than what was stipulated \nin the PPC decision. \n(viii)  Livelihood and economic programs. The livelihood programs carried out were \nnot successful. Cows that were imported from New Zealand died due to different \nweather conditions and environment. Relocatees have no experience in cow \nbreeding, and training and supervision from the company responsible for the \nprogram was lacking. For tea growing, tea will take more than 3 years before \nhouseholds can start harvesting produce. Tea land for allocation to relocatees \nwho wanted to join the program was inadequate. For bamboo and sugarcane \ngrowing, technical know-how on selling the produce was missing, and the market \nis 40 kilometer (km) away from resettlement site. Relocatees have no other \nsources of income. \n(ix)  Grievance  redress.  Complaints  or  grievances  filed  by  relocatees  and  host \ncommunities since 2001 have not been resolved. \n(x)  Ethnic  minorities.  Ethnic  norms  and  practices  were  not  given  adequate \nconsideration. Changes and livelihood programs were imposed on them. Thus, \nthey are facing difficulties reestablishing their lives. \n(xi)  Implementation arrangements. The resettlement committees have a limited \nnumber of qualified field staff. Son La Provincial Resettlement Committee alone \nhas 60 staff, though most are involved in administration and finance. Most of the \nfieldwork is done at the district level. The district level staff also do not have \nexperience in implementing resettlement and compensation activities.   \n \nD.  Huoi  Quang  Hydropower  Project:  Status  of  Resettlement  Planning  and \n  Implementation \n \n13.  Resettlement planning is continuing. IOL activities are being carried out based on the \nfeasibility study prepared for HQHPP in 2003. Once the IOL is approved, detailed resettlement \nplanning will be carried out. As per feasibility study schedule, construction works will start in \nJanuary 2006 and will be completed in 2009. \n \n14.  The feasibility study (FS) reported that 891 households, mostly Thai ethnic minorities \nfrom four communes and two districts, will have to relocate to two resettlement sites in Than \nUyen District. Due diligence findings show that the relocatees from Muong Kim commune will be \nrelocated within the same commune. However, the proposed site is 12 km away from the \naffected area (reservoir), on top of a mountain (950 meter high), and inhabited by the Hmong \nethnic minorities.  Further, the site lacks a water supply system. The Mission was informed that \nthe plan is to develop the water supply and irrigation systems in the area, though the timing of \nthis plan still is being discussed at the DPC and PPC levels. Interviews with affected village \nleaders and households show that they were informed about the Project and impacts in general, \nthough the details on when and where they will relocate are not known. When the due diligence \nteam discussed the proposed site in Muong Kim, village leaders and affected households stated \nthat they cannot survive in the mountains, because of the cold weather and the absence of a \n   ", "  Appendix 15  71\nwetland in the area. They also suggested that they cannot live together with Hmong ethnic \nminorities at the proposed site. The Hmong ethnic minorities (host communities in Muong Kim) \nalso were interviewed, and they also stated that Thai ethnic minorities cannot live in their area \ndue to the cold climate and the land in their area is not productive. Hmong ethnic minorities \nstated that they already have a food shortage for 6 months per year.   \n \n15.  The  second  resettlement  site  is  at  Moung  Than  Commune,  45  km  away  from  the \nreservoir along National Road 32. Under the proposal, the relocatees from Moung Kim and Ta \nGia communes will be relocated in the site. Hmong and Thai ethnic minorities inhabit the area. \nAgain, the area lacks an irrigation system, and appears not to have any unutilized or unclaimed \nland. Initial interviews with the host communities stated that they were not consulted on any \nresettlement planning. They added that they are unwilling to share their land, because they \nhave invested so much in it over the years. The commune chairman from the host communities \nalso reported that the resettlement planning has not been carried out properly, because the \nresettlement sites selected did not take into consideration the current land use of the area. The \nsites were selected, the chairman said, solely based from an old land use map.    \n \nE.  Ongoing Activities, Concerns, and Issues Raised \n \n16.  For  SLHPP,  the  PPC  and  resettlement  committees  at  all  levels  acknowledged  the \noutstanding issues and problems at the pilot resettlement sites. They said that the resettlement \nimplementation activities were carried out before the issuance of Special Decision 459/QD-TTg.  \nThey added that resettlement is very complex, and they learned a lot from their shortcomings.  \nSon La PPC stated that they are trying to address the problems by convening an appraisal \ngroup to assess the problems at the pilot resettlement sites directly. Dien Bien PPC stated that \nthey do not have any plans to address these issues. \n \n17.  For the remaining population that will be relocated,2 the following concerns also were \nraised: (i) not enough information and lack of detailed studies on land and water availability and \nsustainability;  (ii)  poor  preparation  of  the  master  plan,  and  inaccurate  and  inadequate \npreparation of detailed RPs; (iii) lack of capacity of assigned staff to carry out such complex \ntasks involving resettlement of thousands of households; (iv) inadequate information on the \nimpacts on host communities that will be affected by land recovery; (iv) Thai ethnic minorities, \nwho are dependent on wetlands and who need to adjust to the new environment; and (v) \ninsufficient information dissemination and consultation. They also recognize that the risk of \nimpoverishment is very high if income restoration and economic programs are not put in place \nat  the  resettlement  sites.  They  stated  that  these  programs  are  crucial  for  the  survival  of \nrelocatees and host communities. They added that relocatees are provided with rice subsidies \nfor only 2 years, and that they need to have successful livelihood programs to ensure that they \nwill be able to sustain themselves.   \n \n18.  In discussions on the plight of the affected population at the pilot resettlement sites, \nSLHPPMB and EVN indicated that they have no role in resettlement implementation, other than \nproviding 46% of the funds. The responsibility lied with the provinces concerned. They also \nrecognized the limitations of the resettlement committees at all levels due to the complexity of \nresettlement activities. Further, they noted, the resettlement committees have limited staff and \n                                                 \n2 By the end of 2005, Son La Province will start relocating 2,000 households, while Dien Bien Province also is \nscheduled to relocate 300 households. Relocation activities are expected to be completed by 2009.   \n  ", "72   Appendix 15 \n \nexperience on resettlement. They added that capacity building is needed, and suggested that \nADB provide assistance to the resettlement committees for the implementation activities. \n \n19.  For HQHPP, the PPC and DRC concurred with the due diligence findings that the \nproposed sites are unacceptable and require careful and detailed studies. The quality of the \ndraft IOL report is poor. It lacks consultation with relocatees and host communities, and requires \nproper identification and assessment of impacts and planning of proposed sites. The DRC also \nemphasized the need for sustainable livelihood programs. The DRC also mentioned that they \ndo not have enough qualified staff to carry out resettlement planning and implementation, and \nthat training and capacity building are required.   \n \nF.  Gaps Between ADB\u2019s Social Safeguard Policies and Government Implementation \n \n20.  Except on gender issues and monitoring, the Special Decision 459/QD-TTg and PPC \ndecisions  adopted  for  the  remaining  affected  population  are  very  close  to  ADB\u2019s  social \nsafeguard policies and requirements. However, due diligence findings show that the main issue \nis the need to ensure proper implementation of Government policies and regulations. Additional \nqualified staff clearly are needed. Further, resettlement committees lack the capacity to prepare \nand implement detailed plans, as well as the Government\u2019s plan to accelerate resettlement \nactivities to meet the overall project schedule.   \n \nG.  Conclusion and Recommendations \n \n21.  Although the Government did not comply fully with their own policy, and did not meet the \nobjectives of improving the lives of the relocatees and host communities at the pilot resettlement \nsites, the Government acknowledges these outstanding issues under the SLHPP. For example, \nSon La recently took up measures to address the land shortage issue. Resettlement planning \nand implementation activities are continuing. Thus, the situation still can be improved and \nrectified.   \n \n22.  For  the  pilot  resettlement  sites,  the  failure  to  address  the  immediate  need  for  a \ncompatible and culturally appropriate livelihood programs poses the risk that people would be \nled  into  more  hardships  and  dire  poverty.  It  would  also  continue  to  create  hostilities, \nundermining  social  cohesion  in  the  area,  unless  the  impacts  on  host  communities  are \naddressed properly.   \n \n23.  For  the  remaining  affected  population  in Son  La  and Huoi  Quang  HPPs,  a  similar \nsituation might occur if these issues are not addressed in a timely and effective manner. As \nsuch, the Government agreed to a technical assistance (TA) grant for $1 million to build the \ncapacity of the provincial and district officials in the planning and implementation of RPs, as well \nas in defining the livelihood programs based on the available resources in resettlement sites. \nSuch a TA is being proposed from the Poverty Reduction Fund to engage international and local \nexperts to assist the Government in addressing the specific recommendations: \n \n(i)  For the Pilot Resettlement Sites (Son La HPP) \n \n(a)  Undertake  detailed  investigations  to  determine  actual  losses, \ncompensation  received,  and  additional  compensation  payment  and \nassistance due to relocatees and host communities to be able to address \ngrievances and rectify inadequate compensation for host communities \nand relocatees. \n   ", "  Appendix 15  73\n(b)  Undertake  consultations  with  relocatees  and  host  communities  to \ndetermine  the  extent  of  additional  allowances  required,  such  as  the \nprovision of additional rice subsidies and provision of fertilizers and seeds \nto increase productivity of land.  \n \n(ii)  For the Remaining Affected Population (Son La and Huoi Quang HPPs)  \n \n(a)  Carefully  prepare  socioeconomic  baseline  survey  and  assessment  of \nimpacts, including downstream impacts. \n \n(iii)  For  the  Pilot  Resettlement  Sites  (Son  La  HPP)  and  Remaining  Affected \nPopulation (Son La and Huoi Quang HPPs) \n \n(a)  Design and implement an effective and culturally appropriate livelihood \nprogram with full participation of the relocatees and host communities, so \nthat their income and standard of living improve. \n(b)  Set up an effective and culturally appropriate grievance mechanism by \nestablishing  permanent  grievance  offices  at  the  resettlement  sites  to \nensure that people know where to make complaints, and that they will be \nheard and addressed fairly. Grievance officers must be knowledgeable in \ndealing  with  complaints  and  make  all  reasonable  attempts  to  resolve \nissues and complaints at the commune level in a timely and efficient \nmanner  through  community  consultation.  As  required,  nongovernment \norganizations,  mediators,  and  facilitators,  as  well  as  social  and \nresettlement experts will be involved. \n(c)  Make  information  dissemination,  consultation,  and  participation  fully \ninformative, transparent, culturally appropriate, and gender sensitive to \nrelocatees and host communities throughout the life of the Project. \n(d)  Carry out further studies on land availability and capability, and water \nresources availability and development of irrigation systems to ensure \nadequate production land, so that all relocatees and host communities \ncan improve their income and standard of living.   \n(e)  Establish a mechanism to assist relocatees who might wish to group \nthemselves together and opt to find their own resettlement sites. For \nexample,  a  small  group  of  five  to  10  households  might  purchase \ncollectively a suitable piece of land, which they have full knowledge of \nand where the social support system is already in place (i.e., relatives and \nfriends living within the identified area of preference).   \n(f)  Set  up  an  effective  monitoring  system  to  monitor  impacts  and \nimplementation issues, so that changes and improvements can be made \nto meet overall objectives. \n \n  (iv)  For Resettlement Committees \n \n(a)  Increase the number of provincial and district resettlement committee \nmembers, as required, and ensure that the affected population is properly \nrepresented in the committees. \n(b)  Undertake  training  and  capacity  building  to  strengthen  institutional \ncapability for managing the resettlement, compensation, and economic \nand livelihood programs. \n  "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051223150711+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051129194316+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R353-05cover.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "RSA", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \n  SLHP  \u2013  Son La Hydropower Project \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  STD  \u2013  sexually transmitted disease \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n  GWh  \u2013  gigawatt-hour (1,000 kWh) \n  kV  \u2013  kilovolt (1,000 volts) \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  kW  \u2013  kilowatt (1,000 watts) \n  kWh  \u2013  kilowatt-hour (1,000 watt-hours) \n  MVA  \u2013  megavolt-ampere (1,000 kilovolt amperes) \n  MW  \u2013  megawatt (1,000 watts) \n  TWh  \u2013  terawatt-hours \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, $ refers to US dollars. \n \nDirector General  R.
