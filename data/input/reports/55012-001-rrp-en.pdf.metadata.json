The project investment component under the APVAX will be utilized. The project will \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  National  Plan  for  COVID-19  Vaccination  in  Afghanistan \n(NPCVA) in line with the fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) approach and Strategy \n2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 \n \n\nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n\nAccess Criteria \nDemonstrated adverse \nimpact of the COVID-19 \npandemic \n \n\nCompleted needs \nAssessment \n\nNational vaccination \nallocation plan \n\nIncremental medical \nwaste management \nplan \n\nGovernor\u2019s letter \n\nEstablished an effective \ndevelopment partner \ncoordination mechanism \nand a clear role for ADB \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nThe real GDP is estimated to contract by 5.0% in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 \nprojection of 3.0% growth. The unemployment rate is projected to increase from 23.9% \nin 2019 to 37.9% in 2020. The poverty rate increased drastically in 2020, with 61%\u201373% \nof people living below the national poverty line of about $1 per day\u2014a significant increase \nfrom 55% in 2016/2017. \nA  needs  assessment  conducted  by  the  MOF,  the  MOPH,  and  development  partners \nidentified gaps. The NPCVA addresses the findings of readiness assessments conducted \nby WHO and UNICEF (VIRAT) and by the World Bank (VRAF).  \nThe  MOPH  has  developed  the  NPCVA  in  consultation  with  ministries,  institutions, \nprovinces, and partners. The NPCVA is aligned with the WHO SAGE on global COVID-\n19 policies and strategies. It (i) clearly identifies vulnerable groups first; (ii) provides a \nfinancing plan to vaccinate up to 60% of the population; and (iii) outlines implementation \narrangements, cold chain systems, and reporting and monitoring systems.  \nThe NPCVA describes the collection and safe disposal of all medical sharps waste and \nsyringes in safety boxes, to centralized health facility for safe destruction or sterilization \nin  WHO-approved  facilities.  It  describes  the  procedures  in  place  based  on  the  Health \nCare Waste Management Plan (validated in 2018) for handling and disposal of medical \nwaste. \nADB  has  received  the  governor\u2019s  letter  confirming  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimplement its NPCVA, including its prioritization plan and compliance with the APVAX \nvaccine eligibility criteria. \nAn effective partner coordination mechanism is in place, which ADB participates in and \ncontributes to. The tight coordination ensures that all contributions are complementary, \nand  that  partners  can  support  each  other  with  implementation.  It  is  based  on  using \nexisting systems and expertise to fast-track procurement and implementation.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, \nGDP = gross domestic product, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOPH = Ministry of Public Health, NPCVA = National Plan \nfor  COVID-19  Vaccination in Afghanistan,  SAGE  =  Strategic  Advisory  Group  of  Experts on  Immunization,  VIRAT  = \nVaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool, VRAF = Vaccine Readiness Assessment Framework, WHO = World \nHealth Organization. \nSource: ADB. \n \n\n \n\n1   The proposed project was prepared under the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach following the streamlined business processes \noutlined in the APVAX policy paper.

It  will  also \ncomplement efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and foster economic growth in the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n \nStatus of the pandemic and country context. The World Health Organization (WHO) \n4. \ndeclared  COVID-19  a  global  pandemic  on  11  March  2020.  The  first  case  in  Afghanistan  was \nconfirmed  on  22  February  2020,  prompting  the  government  to  implement  control  measures. \nFollowing a first wave in May\u2013June 2020, with a peak of 1,231 reported COVID-19 cases on 17 \nJune 2020, a second wave started in late 2020.4 As of 25 March 2021, the government reported \n56,226 cases and 2,467 deaths of COVID-19.5 The extent of the pandemic is underreported in \nthe country because of limited testing capacity. The reported case fatality rate is 4.4%. Only 0.2% \nof cases have been treated in intensive care units because of limited bed capacity.6 \n \n5. \nAfghanistan is classified as an FCAS country and faces many challenges, including violent \nconflict,  security  issues,  political  instability,  economic  problems,  large  returnee  and  displaced \npopulations, and high levels of poverty and food insecurity. The country faces risks from disasters, \nand some parts are difficult to access because of security issues. As a landlocked country it is \ndependent  on  trade  transit  arrangements  with  neighboring  countries.  These  challenges, \ncombined  with  developing  institutions  and  limited  administrative  capacity,  have  affected  the \ngovernment\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n6. \nEconomic  cost.  While  the  pre-shock  economic  growth  was  already  relatively  low,  the \npandemic had a substantial negative economic impact because of business closures, disruptions \nin  supply  chains,  a  downturn  in  trade  and  remittances,  and  a  drop  in  consumer  demand.  The \nAsian Development Outlook estimated a real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction of 5.0% \nin 2020.7 Afghanistan\u2019s exports are estimated to decline by 35.4% in 2020 and imports by 2.4%. \nThe fiscal budget deficit (excluding grants and budget support loans) was projected to widen from \n$2.65 billion (13.9% of GDP) in 2019 to $3.96 billion (20.8% of GDP) in 2020. \n \n7. \nImpact  on  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  was  projected  to \nincrease the unemployment rate (including in the informal sector) from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% \nin 2020.8 This was compounded by the increase in food prices, housing, and health services, and \ndramatic declines in remittances inflows, which were projected to have more than halved in 2020 \n\n \n\n3  World Bank. 2020.

Kabul (25 March). As of 25 March, only 335,965 people had been tested for COVID-19 \nout of the population of about 38.9 million. A study by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) conducted in 2020 found \nthat one-third of the population was likely to have been infected by COVID-19.   \n\n6   Corona Tracker.

The World Bank estimated that the poverty rate increased drastically in 2020, with \n61%\u201373%  of  people  living  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  about  $1  per  day;  a  significant \nincrease from 55% in 2016/2017.9 The pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on the poor \nand vulnerable families, including returnees and internally displaced people.10 \n \n8. \nImpact on gender. The COVID-19 pandemic has rolled back the gains made on women's \nrights, exacerbating gender inequalities, leading to increased violence against women and girls, \nand further limiting women's access to critical services and resources to respond to the crisis.11 \nWomen and girls already had limited access to critical health care, including maternal and child \nhealth care, particularly in rural areas where 75% of the population live. In Afghanistan, only 15% \nof nurses and 2% of medical doctors are women, because of rigid gender norms limiting women\u2019s \nroles outside the home as well as their employment opportunities. This critically limits women and \ngirls\u2019 access to health care, including COVID-19-related treatment, as some women and girls may \nnot want to be treated by male doctors or health workers. It is crucial to increase the number of \nfemale vaccinators to ensure that women are not left out from COVID-19 vaccination. \n \nImpact on the health system. Although Afghanistan has achieved notable improvements \n9. \nin its health system, it lags significantly behind the rest of the Middle East and Central Asia region \nin  terms  of  services  and  key  health  indicators.12  During  the  peak  of  the  pandemic,  the  health \nsystem was unable to provide (i) adequate testing and protection to health care workers and (ii) \nacceptable clinical management to patients. Hundreds of health care workers were infected with \nCOVID-19 and dozens have died.13 Many patients have died because of a shortage of oxygen \nsupply, and only one-third of public hospital beds are designated for COVID-19 patients, with very \nfew in intensive care units. Given these, a surge in severe COVID-19 cases in hospitals will disrupt \nmedical services beyond COVID-19 patients management (footnote 6). A vaccination program is \ncritical to flatten the COVID-19 case curve to ensure health services are not overwhelmed. \n \n10. \nInitial measures introduced by the government to control the pandemic. The Ministry \nof  Public  Health  (MOPH),  in  coordination  with  relevant  ministries,  prepared  the  National \nEmergency Response Plan for Coronavirus in 2020, which was based on the response plans of \nWHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).14 The President of Afghanistan chairs \nthe  COVID-19  national  response coordinating  committee  (NRCC)  of  ministries  and  partners  to \nprovide  oversight  and  guide  and  coordinate  the  pandemic  response,  supported  by  multisector \n\n \n\n9  World  Bank.  2020.

ADB provided a $40 million emergency assistance grant \n(EAG), under which (i) 8 hospitals are being constructed (adding 600 new beds) and expected for \ncompletion by May 2021, and (ii) medicines and medical equipment were delivered and oxygen \nconcentrators distributed to all provinces in the second half of 2020.15 The remaining 12 hospitals \nwill be constructed or rehabilitated by the end of 2021 (adding 550 new beds). The World Bank \nprovided $146 million, and the European Union provided \u20ac117 million, in addition to other grants. \nADB, with a $100 million grant through its COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \n(CARES) program,16 the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have also provided \nassistance aimed at reducing the overall social and economic impacts of COVID-19.17 \n \n11. \nLessons.  The  project\u2019s  design  is  informed  by  the  best  practices  learned  from  recent \nprojects. For the EAG, the majority of procurement was done through WHO and UNICEF; this \narrangement  ensured  that  supplies  were  of  good  quality  and  has  helped  mitigate  several \nprocurement  risks.  ADB\u2019s  support  in  strengthening  the  project  management  capacity  of  the \nMOPH proved to be essential for implementation of the EAG. The capacity strengthening process \nrequires a long-term commitment from ADB and should be continued under the project. \n \n12. \nNeeds assessment. The high transmission scenario for Afghanistan, projecting 740,000 \ninfected persons seems likely, with at least 46,000 inpatients and 7,208 deaths.18 It was estimated \nthat not having access to COVID-19 vaccines would cost low-income countries $28 billion\u2013$200 \nbillion  of  their combined GDP.19  The  impact of  vaccination  will  depend  on the maintenance  of \ncontrol measures,  public  hesitancy for vaccination,  and  possible  new  viral  strains.20  While  the \nthreshold of the population to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to induce herd immunity or the \ncapacity of any vaccine so far to reduce the transmission of the virus are not yet known, a degree \nof \u201cfunctional immunity\u201d can be met. 21 Functional immunity corresponds to a level of protection \nthat will not necessarily prevent one from getting infected but will drastically reduce the risk of \ncontracting a severe form of the disease or dying. Protecting selected groups, whether they are \nmore vulnerable or essential to the continuation of prioritized activity in the country, will reduce \nthe burden of medical services in hospitals, reduce mortality because of COVID-19, and maintain \nessential public services and production capacity. The target is 60% (approximately 23.3 million \npeople) of the total population (excluding those below 18 years old) to reach this goal. \n \n13. \nThe  Afghanistan  public  health  system  is  capable  of  implementing  a  public  vaccination \ncampaign and has delivered as many as 14 million vaccinations per annum.22 In 31 of the 34 \nprovinces, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are delivering public health services through \nservice  provider  contracts.23  The  National  Expanded  Program  on  Immunization  (NEPI)  has \n\n \n\n15 ADB. 2020.

Potential hurdles, which \nmainly concern rural areas, include local leaders\u2019 buy-in, public hesitancy, availability of female \nstaff,  and  staff  security.  Alternative  vaccination  strategies  have  been  developed  for  remote \nlocations, such as using mobile clinics and providing incentives for community vaccination drives. \n \nNational Plan for COVID-19 Vaccination in Afghanistan. The MOPH has developed \n14. \nthe NPCVA in consultation with ministries, institutions, provinces, and partners.24 The program \naims to vaccinate at least 20% of the population by December 2021, and another 40% in 2022, \nsubject to vaccine availability. The prioritized 20% (7.78 million people) are ranked in the following \norder:  (i)  health  workers,  (ii)  teachers,  (iii)  security  personnel,  (iv)  prisoners,  (v)  people  with \ncomorbidities, (vi) people over 50 years of age, (vii) nomadic people, (viii) internally displaced \npeople, (ix) returnees from countries with high COVID-19 prevalence, (x) government employees \nwho are working with crowds, and (xi) people living in urban slums and others for emergency \nuse. Children below 18 years old will not be vaccinated. Vaccinating pregnant women will depend \non clinical trials and political support. \n \n15. \nThe  NRCC  has  been  extended  to  include  COVID-19  vaccination.  The  MOPH  has \nestablished a strong coordination structure, including the High-Level Health Program Oversight \nCommittee  (HLHPOC)  chaired  by  the  minister  of  public  health,  which  brings  together  key \ndevelopment  partners  including  ADB;  the  World  Bank;  United  Nations  agencies;  and \nrepresentatives from civil society, private sector, and the MOF. The HLHPOC is responsible for \nCOVID-19 vaccine rollout, primarily through the NEPI, and provides programmatic directions and \ncoordination  among  all  involved  ministries,  provinces,  and  partners.  The  NPCVA  provides  a \nbudget and financing plan to provide up to 60% of the population with COVID-19 vaccination at \na  cost  of  $319  million.  Afghanistan  is  a  beneficiary  of  the  COVID-19  Vaccines  Global  Access \n(COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) mechanism through the COVAX initiative led by \nGavi,  the  Vaccine  Alliance  (GAVI).25  As  such,  it  will  receive  vaccines  and  ancillary  items  for \nvaccinating 16%\u201320% of the population. Several vaccines are being considered for emergency \napproval by the Afghanistan National Regulatory Authority.26 \n \n16. \nThe  MOPH  and  partners  have  made  detailed  plans  for  the  cold  chain  system  to  make \nvaccines available in 2,227 health facilities. Storage, transportation capacity, and quality control \nof vaccines are also to be increased. Vaccination will be delivered through the NEPI structure and \nstaff for routine immunization as well as medical facilities. To address a gender-based challenge \nfor  women  who  will  be  vaccinated,  MOPH  will  ensure  that  1,000  female  vaccinators  will  be \nrecruited  among  the  2,000  additional  vaccinators  to  be  hired,  in  addition  to  the  existing  4,454 \nvaccinators, half of whom are women.

A training plan for vaccinators has been prepared. Special arrangements are being \nmade  to  ensure  the  safety  of  health  staff  in  remote  locations  and  areas  controlled  by  anti-\ngovernment  elements,  including  obtaining  letters  of  guarantee/clearances.  Innovative  options \nmay  have  to  be  considered  to  improve  access  (e.g., mobile  clinics),  and  to  overcome  vaccine \nhesitancy (e.g., incentives). For every target group, a specific implementation strategy has been \nprepared, with dedicated means of identification implemented with partners.27 \n \nThe NPCVA has plans, protocols, and reporting requirements to (i) inform, manage, and \n17. \nscreen potential recipients of the vaccine; and (ii) ensure the quality of vaccines, vaccination, and \nhow to handle adverse events following immunization. The MOPH has strengthened its system \n(based on District Health Information Software 2) for registration, data collection, and reporting.28 \nPatients will be identified based on a procedure detailed in the NPCVA. The MOPH plans to roll \nout  smart  paper  technology  to  provide  real-time  data  from  the  health  facilities  and  use  data \ncollected  by  partner  supervisors.  Tracking  of  vaccination  and  performance  monitoring  will  be \nimplemented by a third-party monitoring firm (Acasus), in coordination with donors.29 There is a \nstrong  emphasis  in  the  NPCVA  on  accountability,  transparency,  and  monitoring.  The  NPCVA \ncovers a community engagement and communication plan, including a wide range of methods \ntailored to different target groups.30 It describes the procedures in place based on Afghanistan\u2019s \nHealth  Care  Waste  Management  Plan  validated  in  2018  for  handling  and  disposal  of  medical \nwaste.31  \n\n \n18. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  grant  of  $50 million  will  support \nprocurement and transportation of vaccines and capacity strengthening of the MOPH, and will \nfully complement assistance of other development partners. The MOPH is coordinating the health \nsector response with all partners\u2014with WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank taking a co-leading \nrole.  The  first  round  of  vaccines  for  16%\u201320%  of  the  population  will  be  financed  through  the \nCOVAX  AMC  mechanism  with  $84  million.  This  funding  will  also  support  distribution, \nstrengthening of cold chains, provision of technical assistance, and capacity building. The World \nBank is processing a project of $113 million which includes $50 million in cofinancing from the \nAfghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  that  will  support  vaccine  procurement,  other  areas \ncovered by GAVI, and delivery of vaccines to the population.32 Key support will also be provided \nby UNICEF and WHO, which will support procurement and distribution of vaccines, training, and \nservice  delivery  and  administration  of  vaccines  to  the  population;  and  other  partners.33  The \nvaccination  process  started  in  February  2021,  and  GAVI  delivered  the  first  batch  of  468,000 \ndoses of AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, on 8 March  2021. \n \n\n \n\n27 People living in camps for internally displaced people aged 30\u201350 years will be vaccinated by additional vaccinators \nusing  a  mobile  strategy,  and  their  identification  will  be  managed  by  the  International  Organization  for  Migration, \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the Ministry of Returnees and Repatriation. \n\n28 District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) is an opensource health management information system. \n29 Acasus. Health. Acasus will provide real-time reports by health facility, which can be aggregated to provincial and \n\nnational levels to help ensure that vaccinations reach the delivery points in the right quantities and quality. \n\n30  For  example,  mass  media  (TV  and/or  radio)  campaigns,  media  workshops  and  monitoring,  and  social  media. \n\nDeveloping IPC/I skills of frontline workers and media representative\u2019s knowledge of the vaccine. \n\n31 The NPCVA provides guidance for (i) segregation according to color coding for different types of biomedical waste; \n(ii) collection using different types of containers; (iii) designated storage locations within health care facilities; (iv) safe \ntransportation  for  treatment  (on-site  and  off-site);  (v)  use  of  personal  safety  devices  mandatory  for  all  personnel \nhandling waste; and (vi) adequate treatment and disposal of syringes, needles, glass vials, and other materials. \n\n32 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 The Government of India has confirmed a donation of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by \n\nthe Serum Institute of India, which will be used for medical workers and teachers. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nB.\n\nProject Description\n\nImpact  and  Outcome.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the following impacts: (i) vulnerable \n19.\ngroups are protected from COVID-19 (footnote 25); and (ii) the spread of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome  coronavirus  2  is  reduced,  and  confidence  of  citizens  is  restored.34  The  project  is \naligned  with  the  following  outcome:  priority  populations  vaccinated  against  COVID-19.35  The \nproject outputs are described below.\n\nThe government requested ADB to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. Following \n20.\nthe  guidance  provided  in  Appendix  4  of  the  APVAX  policy  paper  (footnote  1),  the  project \ninvestment component will be utilized. This approach will provide the flexibility needed to respond \nto the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan.\n\nOutput  1:  COVID-19  vaccines  procured  and  delivered  to  designated  points.  The \n21.\nproject will provide financing to procure vaccines through the COVAX AMC facility with UNICEF \nsupport, as well as procurement of vaccines by UNICEF outside of the COVAX AMC facility, if \nrequired. A minimum of 6  million  doses  of COVID-19  will be  delivered  to the  national store  in \nKabul and regional and provincial centers. The expenditure items will include (i) vaccines that \nmeet any of the eligibility criteria of the APVAX policy paper,36 including advance payments; (ii) \nsafety boxes, syringes, and other items required for the administration of the vaccines; and (iii) \ninternational and national logistics and related services required for the transportation of vaccines \nfrom the place of purchase to designated delivery points. UNICEF will also provide transportation \nsupport from the national store in Kabul to regional and provincial vaccine store centers and to \nother  designated  points  of  delivery  to  support  the  overall  COVID-19  vaccine  rollout  under  the \nNPCVA, including for vaccines procured by other development partners (such as GAVI through \nthe COVAX AMC) that meet the APVAX eligibility criteria (footnote 36). Prior to the disbursement \nof the grant proceeds, the MOPH shall submit to ADB purchase agreements for the vaccines that \ncomply with the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria.\n\nOutput 2: Vaccine program implementation capacity strengthened. This output will \n22.\nsupport strengthening the  capacity  of the MOPH to  effectively  and efficiently  manage vaccine \nimplementation. The output will provide consultant support to strengthen the MOPH\u2019s capacity \nrelated  to  planning,  communications,  coordination,  and  implementation  at  the  national  and \nprovincial levels.  The  project will also  support the  strengthening  of the  project  implementation \nunit (PIU) within the MOPH, which is also used for the EAG (footnote 15), by providing additional \nconsultant support. All capacity strengthening activities will ensure women staff\u2019s participation. \nTechnical trainings will include tailored gender sensitivity sessions to ensure that vaccines are \nadministered to women in a culturally sensitive manner. Community campaigns to promote the \ndemand  for  vaccines  from  the  targeted  population  groups  will  set  targets  for  women  to  be \nreached.  Under  this  output,  a  performance  auditing  firm  will  be  engaged  to  ensure  that  ADB-\nfinanced  vaccines  are  delivered  as  per  the  NPCVA,  and  a  waste  management  firm  will  be \nengaged to provide the technical support and capacity building for waste disposal. The capacity \nstrengthening activities will be coordinated with other regional technical assistance.37\n\n34 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus that causes COVID-19; ADB. 2020.

The pandemic has had significant social and economic impacts on the\n23.\nAfghan population. ADB has added value in terms of its infrastructure and administrative expertise\nand in-depth understanding of the local development process and is considered a trusted partner.\nADB\u2019s  overall  support  for  the  government\u2019s  response  to  COVID-19  is  holistic.  It  involves  an\nexpansion of ADB\u2019s portfolio to the health sector through the $40 million EAG and provision of\n$100  million  in  budget  support  (through  the  CARES  program),  covering  treatment  in  hospitals\nthrough the EAG, prevention with the APVAX, and mitigation of socioeconomic impact through\nthe  CARES  program  (footnote  16).  ADB  has  established  monitoring  mechanisms  under  the\nCARES  program,  on  which  this  project builds  for  efficiently  monitoring  its  implementation.  The\nsupport  for  COVID-19  vaccines  is  essential  for  overcoming  the  pandemic  and  moving  toward\neconomic recovery. ADB\u2019s support will ensure that internationally reputed and medically certified\nsafe  and  high-quality  vaccines  are  made  available  to  the  Afghan  people.  Furthermore,  given\nAfghanistan\u2019s  location  at  the  crossroads  of  Central  Asia,  the  project  will  generate  significant\nregional  public  goods  and  complement  efforts  to  contain  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  foster\ngrowth in the CAREC region, through addressing pandemic risks and cross-border health threats.\n\n3.\n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n24.\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $52  million  (Table  2).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by\nexpenditure  category  and  financier  are  included in  the  project  administration  manual (PAM).38\nThe major expenditure items are the purchase and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, the supply of\nother  ancillary  items  required  for  the  administration  of the  vaccines,  international  and  national\nlogistics and related services required for the transportation of vaccines to designated delivery\npoints, and consulting services for capacity development of the MOPH.\n\n Table 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n\n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.\n\nBase Costb\n1.\n2.\n\nB.\n\nContingenciesc\n\nTotal (A+B) \n\nOutput 1: COVID-19 vaccines procured and delivered to designated points\nOutput 2: Vaccine program implementation capacity strengthened\nSubtotal (A)\n\nAmounta \n\n44.9 \n2.1 \n47.0 \n5.0 \n52.0 \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \na Includes taxes and duties of $1.94 million.

The  executing  agency  will  be  the  MOPH.  The  deputy  minister  for  policy  and\nplanning, MOPH will serve as the project coordinator, with support from the NEPI, MOPH, which\nwill  coordinate  vaccination  rollout  and  will  be  responsible  and  accountable  for  distribution  and\nvaccine  administration  to  groups  identified  by  the  NPCVA.  The  Grant  and  Service  Contract\nManagement Unit, MOPH will support the NEPI Division on the procurement and administrative\nside,  including  maintaining  robust  inventory  management  and  controls  and  monitoring  and\ntracking systems, while the Sehatmandi Coordination Office (SCO), MOPH, will coordinate project\nactivities with all stakeholders.39 Project oversight will be provided through the HLHPOC, which\nwill  meet  regularly  to  review  the  project\u2019s  progress  and  ensure  coordinated  efforts  by  all\nstakeholders (para. 15 and footnote 2).\n\n27.\nThe MOPH has established the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group as well\nas  technical  working  groups  in  operation,  cold  chain,  communication,  surveillance,  adverse\nevents  monitoring,  and  training  committees  to  oversee  specific  aspects  of  the  NPCVA.  The\nnational-level committees are supported by technical committees at the provincial levels, which\n(i) are led by the Provincial Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) Management Team and\nregional EPI management teams, and (ii) bring all relevant partners on the ground. All committees\nwill meet regularly to ensure timely implementation of the NPCVA. The delivery of the vaccines\nto the population will be done through 2,227 existing EPI centers with 4,454 vaccinators and 2,000\nadditional vaccinators. The MOPH\u2019s capacity will be augmented with additional staff (consultants)\nto ensure adequate inventory management and controls and monitoring and tracking systems.\n\n28.\nUNICEF will be engaged through direct contracting as a turnkey procurement agent to\nhandle all aspects of goods and logistics procurement in accordance with the ADB Procurement\nPolicy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB\nBorrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).40  UNICEF  will  also  be  engaged  to  provide\ntransportation  and  logistics  services  to  designated  points  to  support  the  overall  COVID-19\n\n39  The  SCO  of  the  MOPH  oversees  implementation  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Sehatmandi  Project.  It  also  oversees  the \n\nimplementation of the ADB EAG. The SCO will help coordinate project activities with all stakeholders. \n\n40 As the sole procurement coordinator under COVAX, UNICEF is ideally positioned to handle all aspects of the vaccine \n\nsupply chain, including procurement, contract management, and distribution. \n\n\f10 \n\nvaccine rollout under the NPCVA, including vaccines procured by other development partners, \nwhich will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual.41 Value for money will be \nachieved through utilizing a procurement agent with relationships across all major supply chains \nfor the vaccines, ancillary items, and logistics which matches the intent to need to deliver fast, \nsafe  and  high-quality  vaccines.  UNICEF  has  the  required  resources  to  immediately  begin \nproviding services either through or outside of COVAX and is also best positioned to navigate the \nquickly  evolving  vaccine  market  to  ensure  availability  of  fast,  safe,  and  high-quality  vaccines. \nUNICEF is also well positioned in Afghanistan to handle in-country logistics, and UNICEF\u2019s cold \nchain experience is critical for the safe handling of vaccines. \n\n29.\nUNICEF  will  be  engaged  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  MOPH  to  manage  vaccine\nimplementation.

Averting further loss and paving the way for recovery from economic stagnation will require\ncomprehensive  vaccination  combined  with  other  effective  suppression  measures.  While  the\nreduction of morbidity and mortality of vaccinated vulnerable populations will result quickly in a\nreduction of the stress on hospital activities, the achievement of functional immunity (footnote 21)\nagainst COVID-19 through the vaccination program, in addition to natural infection, will result in\nsustainable reduction of mortality and morbidity. It will contribute to setting the economy back on\na  normal  development  track  by  encouraging  the  resumption  of  economic  activities,  including\nproduction, investment, and trade, and will have positive cross-border spillover effects.\n\n\f12 \n\nB.\n\nGovernance and Anticorruption\n\n33.\nA governance risk assessment was carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Second Governance\nand  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.43  The  government  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of\ngovernance,44 and it undertook several governance initiatives during 2016\u20132019.45 However, a\npolitical risk analysis undertaken in 2020 highlighted the likely scenario of continued political and\nsecurity risks, with no final peace deal reached between the state and the Taliban before 2025.46\nA  prolonged  government  formation  under  a  tumultuous  peace  process  and  a  weak  legal\nenforcement regime imply that the political and regulatory risks are likely to persist, and proposed\nreforms  are  unlikely  to  fully  materialize  with  corruption  persisting  in  public  bodies  and  state\ndecision-making.47 The government\u2019s effectiveness is further constrained by poor links between\nthe  national  and  subnational  levels  of  governance,  combined  with  institutional  and  human\ncapacity  challenges.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  the  general  scope  of  procurement  will  rely  upon\nUNICEF  performing  the  role  of  a  procurement  agent  to  carry  out  turnkey  procurement  and\nlogistics  services  for  vaccines  and  ancillary  items.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as\namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOPH. The specific\npolicy requirements and corruption mitigation measures are described in the PAM. All vaccines\nmust  be  either  on  the  WHO  Emergency  Use  Listing  or  WHO  prequalified.48  ADB  will  provide\nfinancing for vaccine procurement only once the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria have been met\n(footnote 36). All cold chain equipment\u2014from the national to the service delivery levels\u2014is WHO\nprequalified.\n\nC.\n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards\n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard\n\n34.\ncategories are as follows.\n\n35.\nEnvironment  (category  C).  The  availability  of  COVID-19  vaccines  will  result  in  a\ntemporary  increase  of  immunization  waste  (e.g.,  used  syringes,  needles,  personal  protective\nequipment) at service points. Hence, minimal environmental impacts are envisaged, as this waste\nwill be disposed following the national medical health care waste management plan, which was\nreviewed and confirmed to be adequate.49\n\n36.\nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not\nentail  any  physical  intervention to  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples\nimpacts.\n\n43 ADB. 2006.

Also  included  in  the  prioritized  groups  for  vaccination  are  nomadic  groups,\ninternally  displaced  persons,  and  those  living  in  slums,  about  49%  of  whom  are  women.  The\nproject will collect sex-disaggregated data on the targeted population groups and information on\nthe cultural appropriateness of vaccination sites for monitoring of the vaccination plan. MOPH\nstaff and consultants, 30% of whom are women, from the central, regional, and provincial offices\nwill  be  trained  on  the  effective  procurement  and  management  of  the  vaccines  in  a  gender-\nsensitive way. The project endeavors to create a gender-sensitive vaccination environment by\nincluding gender-inclusive provisions in the local operational plans on vaccine distribution, such\nas  providing  separate  vaccination  areas  for  women,  training  female  health  workers  who  will\ncommunicate safety procedures to women after vaccination and in between doses, and using\ngender-fair messages in community-targeted campaigns to raise vaccine demand, among others.\n\nE.\n\nFinancial Due Diligence\n\n39.\nFinancial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall  pre-mitigated  financial\nmanagement risk of the project is substantial owing in part to the risk associated with inherited\ncountry security risks, weak institutional governance, a weak internal control system, and limited\nexperience  with  ADB-funded  projects.  To  address  these  weaknesses,  the  following  mitigation\nmeasures,  as  presented  in  the  financial  management  assessment  time-bound  financial\nmanagement action plan, were discussed and agreed with the MOPH: (i) financial management\nconsultants will be engaged to support the MOPH, (ii) training will be provided by ADB to MOPH\nPIU staff on ADB financial management and disbursement guidelines and policies, (iii) PIU staff\nwith prior ADB or World Bank project experience will be deployed, (iv) an information system to\ntrack vaccines and monitor implementation will be operational, (v) internal controls and financial\nreporting will be strengthened as recommended in the financial management action plan, and (vi)\nindependent auditors will conduct both project financial reporting and performance audits.\n\n40.\nBasic  public  health  services  are  provided  free  of  charge.  A  project  financial  viability\nassessment was not undertaken since project outputs are not meant to produce cost recovery.\nThe fiscal sustainability of the country\u2019s vaccination program is at risk because of the country\u2019s\nfiscal limitations, and so is the national health care system, which fully relies on the support of\ndevelopment partners.52 There is a high probability that funding from partners will continue.\n\nF.\n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan\n\nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail\n\n41.\nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.53\n\n50 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n51 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n52 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n53 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f14 \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nMajor Risks \nLong vaccine lead times: high \nglobal demand far \nexceeds supply of approved \nvaccines \nVaccines not allocated according \nto the prioritization plan \n\nSecurity situation and high \ncriminality affect delivery of \nvaccines  \nInsufficient on-the-ground \narrangements for the delivery of \nvaccines to the population \n\n(i) Risk transferred to UNICEF, a qualified procurement agent with\n\npurchasing and negotiating power\n\n(ii) UNICEF to also explore use of bilateral arrangements such as direct\n\nprocurement of eligible vaccines from India or other appropriate sources\n\n(i) Strong oversight and coordination structure in place\n(ii) The MOPH to monitor compliance through a monitoring and evaluation\n\ndatabase\n\n(iii) ADB will hire consultants to supplement coordination and surveillance\n(i) The MOPH to provide security personnel during the transit of vaccines\n(ii) UNICEF and government to use firms with proven logistics track record\n(iii) Low-profile approach with appropriate security measures\n(i) Use of existing EPI centers with a proven track record in delivering\n\nvaccines supported by medical centers and 2,000 additional vaccinators\n(ii) Use of the SCO to support coordination, including monitoring of integrity\n\nrisks and controls, and NGOs to support deployment\n\nMonitoring of adverse vaccine \neffects not effective  \n\n(i) Training provided by UNICEF and WHO to the existing EPI centers and\n\n2,000 additional vaccinators (1,000 mobile teams)\n\nVaccine theft and \nmisappropriation \nIneffective system for stock \nmanagement and tracking of \nvaccines \n\n(ii) Digital tracking systems will be used by the regional and provincial EPI\nmonitoring teams to detect, report, and manage patients presenting\nadverse effects\n\n(i) Standard operating procedures for storekeepers with an established\n\naccountability and transparency framework\n\n(i) Ensure that the MOPH and service providers fully utilize the VSSM tool\nestablished by WHO, and DHIS2 and HMIS up to the health facilities\n(ii) Monitoring cell to be established to monitor the vaccination process and\ndevelop a supervision plan for national, regional, and province managers\n\nVaccines not delivered to difficult-\nto-reach places and areas \ncontrolled by the Taliban \n\n(i) 1,000 additional mobile teams supported by the Red Cross and NGOs\n(ii) The Taliban have expressed support for the vaccination process\n(iii) Special letters of guarantee and/or clearance to be provided by the\n\nImplementing entity has little ADB \nexperience in financial \nmanagement and no experience \nof audit requirements and \nprevious unresolved audit \nobservations from other projects \nWidespread corruption and poor \ngovernance \n\nWeak internal framework and \ncontrols with unreliable systems \nresult in risk of vaccines not being \nused for targeted groups \nLack of standard financial data \ncauses delay in producing data at \nthe project and entity levels \n\nTaliban\n\n(i) Training of MOPH PIU staff on ADB financial management and\n\ndisbursement guidelines and policies, including integrity risks and controls\n(ii) Financial management consultants will be engaged to support the MOPH\n(iii) An independent auditor will conduct a project financial reporting and\n\n(i)\n\nperformance audit using ADB-reviewed terms of references;
