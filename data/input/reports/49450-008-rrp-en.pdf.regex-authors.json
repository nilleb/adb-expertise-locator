BACKGROUND \n1.  On 22 June 2017, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. The facility will finance renewable energy \nprojects in 11 Pacific developing member countries with an overall estimated cost of $750 million \nincluding ADB financing of up to $200 million. Upon approval, the Board delegated to the \nPresident authority to approve loans and/or grants to each of the targeted countries for qualifying \nprojects. \n \n2.  The loan and grant, and the administration of a grant provided by the Strategic Climate \nFund (SCF)1 to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Energy Access Project will be the first project \nfinanced under the facility. \n \n3.  The project will increase access to energy and the generation of renewable energy on \nEspiritu Santo, the country\u2019s second most populous island, and Malekula, the third most populous \n(Efate is the most populated). The project will assist Vanuatu to replace diesel power with \nhydropower to generate electricity in Malekula and will extend the distribution grid in Espiritu \nSanto and Malekula. Project preparatory technical assistance was used in project preparation.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Macroeconomic context. Vanuatu has a population of 234,000 dispersed over more than \n80 islands. More than 75% of the population lives in rural areas. Economic development is largely \nfocused on urban areas. Nationwide access to reliable, affordable electricity is low (33%), \nnegatively impacting on the livelihoods of households, particularly  rural households. In the \nprovinces with access, the electricity supply relies almost entirely on diesel generation. The cost \nof electricity is high, but the quality is also high partially because the private sector operates the \nelectricity grids.3 The high cost of electricity coupled with limited access is negatively impacting \neconomic development, particularly in the provinces. Over-reliance on imported fossil fuels \n(diesel) also has a negative macroeconomic impact. To address these issues, the Government \nof  Vanuatu  requested  ADB  to  support  the  development  of  least-cost  renewable  energy \n(hydropower) and grid extensions in targeted provincial centers. \n  \n5.  Low access to electricity. Access to electricity varies nationally. The access rate is 82% \nin urban areas and 17% in rural areas. Of the 33% of nationwide households with access, 64% \nare connected to the grid and the remainder relies on solar systems or diesel generators. \nHousehold access to grid-connected electricity is 21.5% in Espiritu Santo and 8.2% in Malekula. \nThe main reasons for the low access rates are (i) lack of government community service obligation \nfunding for grid extensions; (ii) difficult geography and small, dispersed pockets of populations, \n(iii) low capacity to pay in some areas; and (iv) the high cost of diesel power generation in the \nprovincial centers because of difficult supply chains and small grid sizes, which provides a \n                                                \n1 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-income Countries. \n2 ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance including (i) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Vanuatu for \nPreparation of the Energy Access Project. Manila, and (ii) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Promotion of \nRenewable Energy in the Pacific. Manila. The latter assisted with screening the provincial centers for priority \nrenewable energy projects. \n3 The Espiritu Santo grid is the second largest in Vanuatu with a peak demand of 1.7 megawatts (MW) and has an \ninstalled capacity of 4.09 MW consisting of (i) the 1.2 MW Sarakata Hydropower Plant, (ii) 2.85 MW diesel generators, \nand (iii) 40 kilowatts (kW) grid-connected solar power. The Malekula grid is the third largest in Vanuatu with 429 kW \ninstalled diesel generation and peak demand of 140 kW. ", "2 \ndisincentive to the power utilities to increase customers (where generation and supply costs \nexceed the tariff) particularly given the low lifeline tariff.  Since there is significant unmet demand, \npeople resort to self-generation but they would connect to the grid if sufficient capacity were \navailable. The limited reach of the distribution grid is slowing economic growth, particularly in the \nagriculture and tourism sectors. There is significant opportunity to increase the access rate by \nextending the existing distribution grid to peri-urban areas.4  \n \n6.  Providing modern electricity services to communities by extending the distribution of grids \n(as opposed to installing household-based solar systems) has been demonstrated to support \neconomic growth, particularly where supporting existing infrastructure and conditions are in place, \nsuch as (i) access roads to markets, (ii) communication systems, and (iii) agricultural produce \nsuitable for value adding. The social benefits of grid extensions include (i) freeing household \nexpenditure by replacing kerosene lighting with a cheaper form of energy, (ii) enabling household \nincome generation, (iii) improving children\u2019s education, and (iv) reducing indoor health and safety \nissues associated with burning kerosene. \n \n7.  High reliance on imported diesel. Over-reliance on imported diesel for power generation \nhas a negative macroeconomic impact. The cost of petroleum product imports typically exceeds \n17% of total imports and 85% of the total value of Vanuatu\u2019s exports.5 On a macroeconomic level, \nincreasing renewable energy in the national energy mix will (i) improve the balance of trade by \nreducing  fossil  fuel  imports,  (ii)  improve  energy  security,  and  (iii)  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions that contribute to global warming. \n \n8.   High  electricity  tariff.  Because  diesel  power  generation  is  more  expensive  than \nrenewable energy options such as hydropower, over-reliance on it has placed upward pressure \non electricity tariffs. These high tariffs are impeding economic growth.6 Renewable energy \ngeneration will benefit the economy by (i) placing downward pressure on tariffs, (ii) minimizing \ntariff volatility by partially converting the national grid to renewable energy, (iii) supporting growth \nof the private sector, and (iv) reducing household expenditure on electricity. \n \n9.  To address the barriers, the project will construct the Brenwe Hydropower Plant that will \nreplace an estimated 90% of the diesel generation in Malekula. The project will increase the \nresidential customer base in Espiritu Santo by 25% and in Malekula by 90%.7 Hydropower has \nbeen assessed to be the least-cost baseload generation option for Malekula.  \n \n10.  Operation and maintenance. The Department of Energy (DOE) within the Ministry of \nClimate Change Adaptation, Meteorology, Geo-Hazards, Environment, Energy and Disaster \nManagement (MOCC) manages the sector policy. Vanuatu is unique among ADB Pacific island \ncountries because the private sector generates and supplies electricity. There are four separate \nprivate sector contracts that operate as stand-alone island grids. These contracts consist of three \nconcessions in Efate (Port Vila), Malekula, and Tanna held by UNELCO EDF Suez (UNELCO), \nand one memorandum of agreement in Espiritu Santo (Luganville) held by Vanuatu Utilities and \nInfrastructure Limited. The Utilities Regulatory Authority (URA) sets tariffs under the Luganville \nmemorandum of agreement, while tariffs are set contractually for the concessions. UNELCO and \n                                                \n4 The currently installed diesel-based generation capacity is adequate to supply the existing load.  \n5 National Statistics Office: Quarterly Statistics Indicators, September 2013. \n6 In UNELCO\u2019s concessions, including Malekula, the average tariff is $0.59 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). However, \ncustomers consuming less than 60 kWh/month are covered by a lifeline tariff of $0.16c/kWh while high consumption \nusers above 120 kWh/month are charged $1.43/kWh. Rates for commercial customers are $0.41/kWh. \n7 The project is focusing on increased access through grid extensions. The Vanuatu Electricity for Rural Development \nProgram, financed by the Government of New Zealand and implemented by the World Bank, is supporting increased \naccess for off-grid households.  \n ", "3 \nVanuatu Utilities and Infrastructure Limited operations are financed through the electricity tariff \nand do not receive direct government subsidies. Electricity assets are owned by the government \nand operated by private utilities (under operation and maintenance contracts).  \n \n11.  Alignment with development plans. ADB has experience supporting the development \nof transport and urban infrastructure in Vanuatu and providing technical assistance for the energy \nsector.8 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for \nVanuatu.9 The project is integrated into the government\u2019s long-term strategic planning. The \nproject supports the government\u2019s National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132030 that aims \nto promote renewable sources of energy.10 The project qualifies to be included under the Pacific \nRenewable Energy Financing Facility11 because it aims to improve energy security in the Pacific \nregion consistent with the regional Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific.12 \nVanuatu is one of the 11 eligible Pacific developing member countries. The project is eligible \nbecause it generates electricity from renewable energy, is included in the Vanuatu National \nEnergy Road Map, and has been classified category B for the environment. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be improved livelihoods of households in Espiritu Santo and Malekula in \nalignment with the National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. The outcome will be an \nincreased supply of clean renewable electricity to households in Espiritu Santo and Malekula.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The outputs of the project are as follows: \n(i)  Brenwe Hydropower Plant. A 400-kilowatt (kW) run-of-river hydropower plant will \nbe constructed, including (a) 2 kilometers (km) of access roads, (b) a 21-km \ntransmission line (20 kilovolts), (c) an intake structure, (d) a 1-km headrace canal, \n(e) a 190-meter steel penstock, and (f) a powerhouse. The Brenwe Hydropower \nPlant will provide more than 90% of the total generated energy for the Malekula \ngrid through 2040.14 \n(ii)  Distribution grid extension. The grid will be extended to an estimated 1,050 \nhouseholds. This will increase the grid access rate from 22% to 29% in Espiritu \nSanto  and from  8% to  14%  in  Malekula. The  project  will  finance  79  km  of \ndistribution lines, step-down transformers, and poles.  \n                                                \n8  Recent projects include the (i) Port Vila Urban Development Project, approved on 13 December 2011; and (ii) \nInterisland Shipping Support Project. Recent technical assistance to the energy sector includes (i) TA 7329-REG: \nPromoting Access to Renewable Energy in the Pacific, and (ii) TA 7798\u2013REG Promoting Energy Efficiency in the \nPacific (Phase 2).  \n9  ADB. 2016.

The  government  requested  a  concessional  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR1,768,000 ($2.5 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government also requested a grant \nnot exceeding $2.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the Asian Development Fund) \nto help finance the project. Vanuatu has received the approval of a $7 million grant from the SCF, \nto be administered by ADB, to help finance the project.15  Vanuatu will finance the remainder of \nthe total project cost of $3.1 million consisting of land acquisition costs, taxes and duties, and \ndistribution of civil works contracts. Since ADB is administering cofinancing resources in the form \nof grants from the SCF for operations financed by the Asian Development Fund, universal \nprocurement will apply to all procurement packages under the project.16 The summary financing \nplan is in Table 2. \n   \n                                                \n15 The government received clearance from the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries \n(SREP) sub-committee to proceed with project preparation based on the $7 million grant availability from SREP.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) will be the executing agency. \nMOCC-DOE will be the implementing agency with day-to-day implementation activities delegated \nto the Vanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU). MOCC-DOE will provide a project focal point \nto oversee project implementation. The focal point will work closely with the VPMU. The project \nwill finance design and supervision consultants, equipment, and office furnishings to help the \nVPMU implement the outputs. Consulting firms will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Individual consultants will be recruited using \nthe individual consultant selection and Consultants\u2019 Qualifications Selection. All consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n17.  The VPMU will be responsible for the procurement of all civil works and goods contracts. \nThe procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).17 Vanuatu asked ADB to select the design and \nsupervision of consultants on its behalf, but the contracts will be signed between the government \nand the consultants. Additional financing for additional sites may be considered if the project is \nperforming well. The VPMU Steering Committee will act as the project steering committee, which \nwill oversee implementation, monitor progress, and provide guidance to the executing agency. \nThe VPMU will act as the secretariat.  \n \n18.  The project will be implemented over 6 years with completion estimated by October 2023. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  government  requested  advance  contracting  for  consultant \nrecruitment. ADB informed the government that approval of advance contracting does not commit \nit to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.18  \n   \n                                                \n17 Distribution civil works contracts to be financed by government counterpart financing will follow procedures \nacceptable to the URA.   \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2017\u2013October 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 October 2023 \nEstimated loan/grant closing date  29 March 2024 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  VPMU Steering Committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  MFEM \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MOCC-DOE, VPMU \n(iv)  Implementation unit  59 person-months international and 46 person-months national; \nadditional consultants will be mobilized as required.  \nProcurement  International  4 contracts  $7.6 million \ncompetitive bidding \nShopping  1 contracts  $0.1 million \nDirect Contractinga.  1 contract   $0.1 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  107 person-months  $1.5 million \nICS  12 person-months  $0.4 million \nCQS  Auditor  $0.05 million \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CQS = Consultant Qualification Selection; DOE = Department of Energy; ICS = \nindividual consultant selection; MFEM = Ministry of Finance and Economic Management; MOCC = Ministry of \nClimate Change Adaptation, Meteorology, Geohazards, Energy, Environment and Natural Disaster Management; \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; VPMU = Vanuatu Project Management Unit. \na.

The proposed hydropower plant and extended distribution grid have been assessed to be \ntechnically  viable.  An  analysis  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical \nconfiguration for all components, including an analysis of the hydrology of alternative river \ncatchments, hydropower turbine size configurations, penstock arrangements, and distribution \nconfigurations  to  maximize  system  efficiencies.  The  design  was  based  on  the  analysis  of \nVanuatu\u2019s conditions to ensure that the proposed systems are suitable for local conditions. \nHydrological monitoring is ongoing at the proposed site and will be used to update the analysis \nduring detailed design. The detailed design will incorporate climate change resilience measures. \nB.  Economic  \n20.  The economic internal rate of return for the consolidated project is 14.9%, and the \neconomic net present value is $5.9 million. This indicates that the project is economically viable \nsince it exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. A sensitivity analysis was \nconducted to account for potential increases in economic costs, as well as a reduction of \neconomic  benefits.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicated  the  economic  viability  is  robust,  with \neconomic internal rate of return exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital even under a \nworst-case scenario where a 20% increase in costs was combined with a 20% decrease in \nrevenues.   \n ", "7 \nC.  Financial \n21.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Brenwe hydropower plant is 7.2%, with \na  project  net  present  value  of  $3.4  million.  The  project\u2019s  financial  viability  was  assessed \ncomparing the FIRR with the (real) weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC to the \ngovernment is 5.2%, which is lower than the FIRR. The sensitivity analysis for the Brenwe \nHydropower Plant, excluding grid extensions, revealed the FIRR would be below the WACC for \nboth a 20% increase in costs and a 20% reduction in revenues, indicating the project is sensitive \nto these changes. If evaluated on a stand-alone basis, the Brenwe Hydropower Plant is financially \nviable with a positive FNPV. However, the Malekula grid extension and the Port Olry grid \nextension components have negative FNPVs. This is due to a large number of low energy \nconsumption households in the grid extension areas, which make investment in grid extensions \nfinancially  unviable.  The  grid  extensions  should  be  considered  for  financing  through  the \ntransparent allocation of funding as a community service obligation. The Brenwe Hydropower \nPlant was assessed as the least-cost generation alternative for the Malekula grid.  \nD.  Governance \n22.  Financial management. The project financial management assessment was prepared in \naccordance  with  the  Technical  Guidance  Note  on  ADB  Project  Financial  Management \nAssessment.19 The assessment concluded that the overall project financial management risk was \nmoderate.  The  country  issues  assessed  included  (i)  public  financial  management,  (ii) \nmanagement  and  skills  capacity,  and  (iii)  country  environment.  A  financial  management \nassessment was conducted for MOCC-DOE and the VPMU.20 It concluded that MOCC-DOE had \ninsufficient resources for the financial management of the project. However, since the VPMU has \nexperience in the financial management of ADB projects, the assessment concluded it would be \na suitable implementing agency to manage finances. Based on this risk evaluation, it was \nproposed that the project management unit (PMU) be based within the VPMU. The assessment \nidentified inadequacies in internal auditing. A budget for external auditors has been included to \naddress the issue.   \n23.  Procurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment was completed for the \nVPMU and MOCC-DOE. The assessment concluded that MOCC-DOE has inadequate capacity \nto manage the anticipated procurement for the project, and the VPMU has adequate capacity. \nBased on this risk evaluation, it is proposed to (i) embed the Design and Supervision Consultants \nwithin the VPMU, (ii) build capacity of targeted VPMU staff, and (iii) build capacity within MOCC-\nDOE by posting relevant staff in the VPMU.  \n24.  Private  sector.  Options  to  involve  the  private  sector  in  project  development  were \nassessed, including the independent power provider model, operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncontracts,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships.  It  was  determined  that  the  optimum  model  for \nengaging private sector expertise would be through O&M contracts, preferably with existing \nprivate sector concessionaire holders for the proposed assets. For the project assets (including \nthe hydropower plant, transmission and distribution lines), the government will retain asset \n                                                \n19 ADB, Technical Guidance Note for Financial Management Assessment, Manila, 2015 \n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005.

Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with  MFEM and MOCC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.23 \nE.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project design includes pro-poor or poverty reduction measures to manage poverty \nissues.  The  project's  poverty  reduction  measures  entail  engaging  low-income  households \n(including landowners) for construction works, extending the distribution grid (including to poor \nhouseholds), and training on income-generating activities. The project will comply with applicable \nnational labor laws and core labor standards, including, but not limited to, equal work for equal \npay regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity, and excluding child labor. The VPMU, which will \ninclude  a  resettlement  and  gender  specialist  who  will  establish  a  monitoring  system,  will \nimplement the poverty reduction measures.  \n27.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has been \ndeveloped based on gender analysis and community consultations. The plan includes specific \nmeasures to ensure project benefits for women during the design and implementation phases. \nThe plan covers the following measures: (i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation activities; (ii) \nthe extension of power connection to 1,050 households, including at least 100 female-headed \nhouseholds; (iii) capacity building training for newly connected households including women on \npower safety, utility budget management, and potential use for income generation; (iv) the \nencouragement of women\u2019s participation in project-related contracts; and (v) the collection of sex-\ndisaggregated project-related data for monitoring and reporting requirements.  \nF.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is classified category B for the environment following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination was prepared. The \nmain potential environmental impacts will be created by the construction of the access road, the \nremoval of vegetation within a modified habitat, the plant installation at the intake and powerhouse \nsites, and vegetation trimming along the transmission line corridor. Following a detailed design, \nthe environmental management plan will be updated and integrated into the bidding documents. \nIf there are changes to the scope of the works, the VPMU will compile an updated initial \nenvironmental examination to be approved by ADB. As part of the assessment, a climate change \nadaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in the preliminary design of the scheme, \nand the findings of the assessment will be integrated into the detailed design. The VPMU will be \nsupported by a Design and Supervision Consultant that will include environmental specialists (2 \nperson-months  international  and  4  person-months  national)  to  ensure  the  environmental \nmanagement plan is implemented and monitored. \n                                                \n21 URA will negotiate the O&M contract with the concession holders following government procurement procedures. \nHowever, if negotiations cannot be concluded, it may consider an independent power provider contract with a third \nparty.  \n22 URA allows investments by concession holders in asset maintenance. Investment in new generation and distribution \ncan also be recovered by the concession holders through the tariff. Asset investment in the Luganville concession is \nconstrained because the concession is currently being tendered, and UNELCO is reluctant to invest in the Malekula \nconcession because the concession expires in 2020, leaving insufficient time to recover asset investments.  \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n29.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified category B for resettlement. The \nproject will have land acquisition impacts for the Brenwe Hydropower Plant that were not deemed \nsignificant, and the transmission line extension at Espiritu Santo will follow the existing road \ncorridor without any resettlement impacts. No physical relocation or loss of major income sources \nis expected from the implementation of the project. The Brenwe hydropower facilities will require \nthe acquisition of about 4.41 hectares of customary land that has not been used for any residential \nor agriculture purpose, and the transmission line will require some tree clearance along the \nexisting provincial road. The land at the hydropower site is claimed by three separate social \ngroups totaling seven households (about 36 persons). As permitted by a government law, the \nland acquisition will proceed after an estimated compensation amount for the portion of the \nhydropower site under dispute is deposited and maintained in a custom owner trust account until \nthe land disputes have been resolved. A resettlement plan was prepared based on impact \nassessment, consultations with affected persons, and preliminary investigations of affected land \nand assets at hydropower sites during project preparation. The resettlement plan will be updated \nfollowing the inventory of losses for the hydropower site and detailed design. Affected persons \nwill be further consulted during the detailed design and implementation. The VPMU will (i) appoint \na focal person for land issues; (ii) establish environmental and social safeguard capacity within \nthe VPMU; and (iii) coordinate with the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, provincial \ngovernment, and other relevant agencies to implement resettlement activities. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The due diligence concluded that Melanesian Ni-Vanuatu groups \nconstitute the majority population in the project area, their institutions are not separate from \nmainstream society, and these groups are not vulnerable because of their ethnicity. Because \nsociocultural groups need to be \u201cdistinct\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d to trigger the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements on indigenous peoples, the project is classified categorized category C \nand does not require an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The risks of the project have been assessed, \nand the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisk  Mitigation Measures \nDelays in land acquisition result in delays in  Extensive consultation with landowners has been carried out in \nconstruction.  accordance with the resettlement plan.

ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and MFEM have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual, and financing and grant documents. The government and \nMFEM have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, as set forth in the financing \nand grant agreements. \n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nV.
